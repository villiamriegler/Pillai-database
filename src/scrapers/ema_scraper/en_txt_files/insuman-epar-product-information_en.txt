PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  
Solution for injection. 
Clear, colourless solution. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. Insuman Rapid is also suitable for the 
treatment of hyperglycaemic coma and ketoacidosis, as well as for achieving pre-, intra- and 
post-operative stabilisation in patients with diabetes mellitus. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen 
(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical 
activity and life-style. 
Daily doses and timing of administration 
There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 
0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total 
daily requirement. Insuman Rapid is injected subcutaneously 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. 
In the treatment of severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis in particular, insulin administration is part of 
a complex therapeutic regimen which includes measures to protect patients from possible severe 
complications of a relatively rapid lowering of blood glucose. This regimen requires close monitoring 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(metabolic status, acid-base and electrolyte status, vital parameters etc.) in an intensive care unit or 
similar setting. 
Secondary dose adjustment 
Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin 
requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if 
- 
- 
- 
the patient's weight changes, 
the patient's life-style changes, 
other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or 
hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly population(≧65 years old) 
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin 
requirements. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin 
metabolism. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced 
capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. 
Method of administration 
Insuman Rapid must not be used in external or implanted insulin pumps or in peristaltic pumps with 
silicone tubing. 
Insuman Rapid is administered subcutaneously. 
Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection 
area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection 
area must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and 
cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Insuman Rapid 40 IU/ml in a vial 
Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection 
syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). 
Insuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The 
injection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). 
Insuman Rapid may also be administered intravenously. Intravenous insulin therapy must generally 
take place in an intensive care unit or under comparable monitoring and treatment conditions (see 
"Daily doses and timing of administration"). 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6.

4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Patients hypersensitive to Insuman Rapid for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must 
only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with 
anti-allergic treatment. 
In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer 
to Insuman Rapid, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. 
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's 
adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all 
other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. 
Transfer to Insuman Rapid 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), 
origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need 
for a change in dose. 
The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, 
it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. 
Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in 
particular in patients who 
- 
- 
- 
were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, 
have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, 
previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In 
patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under 
medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption 
and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in 
the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose 
monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic 
medications may be considered. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. 
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in 
patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients 
with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of 
cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative 
retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following 
hypoglycaemia). 
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain 
risk groups. These include patients: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, 
in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, 
who are elderly, 
after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, 
in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, 
with a long history of diabetes, 
suffering from a psychiatric illness, 
receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5)  
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) 
prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. 
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, 
unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. 
Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and 
awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors 
increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may 
necessitate dose adjustment. These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
-  missed meals, 
- 
- 
change in the injection area, 
improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), 
unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, 
intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), 
inadequate food intake, 
alcohol consumption, 
certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency), 
concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
- 
Intercurrent illness 
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are 
indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often 
increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of 
carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. 
and they must never omit insulin entirely. 
Medication errors 
Medication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been 
accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid 
medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. 
Combination of Insuman with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), 
phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine 
[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the 
placental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Rapid can be used during breast-feeding. 
Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the 
insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed 
use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency 
can be presented.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. 
Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such 
anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to 
hyper- or hypoglycaemia. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. 
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. 
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic 
counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is 
the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. 
Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is 
improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Eyes disorders 
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary 
alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. 
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be 
associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to 
reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4.). 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms 
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. 
Management 
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose 
regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. 
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate 
intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical 
recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, 
ATC Code: A10AB01. 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin 
- 
- 
lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, 
increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles 
and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, 
increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, 
promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, 
enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. 
- 
- 
- 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Insuman Rapid is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. Following subcutaneous 
injection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1 and 4 hours 
after injection and the duration of action is 7 to 9 hours. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin 
do not reflect its metabolic action. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effects was found. Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular 
administration in rabbits gave no remarkable findings. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects 
following subcutaneous administration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic 
reactions.

Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
Before withdrawing insulin from the vial for the first time, remove the plastic protective cap. 
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this may cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct 
measurement of the dose. 
Insuman Rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and 
if it is of a water-like consistency. 
Insuman Rapid must not be used in external or implanted insulin pumps or in peristaltic pumps with 
silicone tubing. 
It must be remembered that neutral regular insulin precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Rapid may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed 
specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. 
If two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the 
shorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting 
preparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen 
(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical 
activity and life-style. 
Daily doses and timing of administration 
There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 
0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total 
daily requirement. Insuman Rapid is injected subcutaneously 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. 
Insuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple

In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's 
adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all 
other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. 
Transfer to Insuman Rapid 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), 
origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need 
for a change in dose. 
The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, 
it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. 
Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in 
particular in patients who 
- 
- 
- 
were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, 
have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, 
previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In 
patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under 
medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption 
and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in 
the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose 
monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic 
medications may be considered. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. 
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in 
patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients 
with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of 
cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative 
retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following 
hypoglycaemia). 
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. 
The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain 
risk groups. These include patients: 
in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, 
- 
in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, 
- 
who are elderly, 
- 
after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, 
- 
in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, 
- 
with a long history of diabetes, 
- 
suffering from a psychiatric illness, 
- 
- 
receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the 
patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. 
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, 
unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and 
awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors 
increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may 
necessitate dose adjustment. These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
-  missed meals, 
- 
- 
change in the injection area, 
improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), 
unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, 
intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), 
inadequate food intake, 
alcohol consumption, 
certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency), 
concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
- 
Intercurrent illness 
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are 
indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often 
increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of 
carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. 
and they must never omit insulin entirely. 
Insuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Pens to be used with Insuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in cartridges 
Insuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. 
The Insuman Rapid cartridges should only be used with the following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Rapid in 0.5 unit dose increments 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Rapid in 1 
unit dose increments. 
These cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been 
established with the listed pens (see section 4.2 and 6.6). 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
Insuman Rapid SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Handling of the pen 
Insuman Rapid SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used (see 
section 4.2).Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be 
read carefully. SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). 
Medication errors 
Medication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been 
accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid 
medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. 
Combination of Insuman with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), 
phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine 
[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the 
placental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Rapid can be used during breast-feeding. 
Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the 
insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed 
use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency 
can be presented.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. 
Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such 
anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to 
hyper- or hypoglycaemia. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. 
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. 
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic 
counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is 
the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. 
Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is 
improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Eyes disorders 
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary 
alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be 
associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to 
reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms 
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. 
Management 
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose 
regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. 
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate 
intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical 
recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, 
ATC Code: A10AB01. 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin 
- 
- 
lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, 
increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles 
and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, 
increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, 
promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, 
enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. 
- 
- 
- 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Insuman Rapid is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. Following subcutaneous 
injection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1 and 4 hours 
after injection and the duration of action is 7 to 9 hours. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin 
do not reflect its metabolic action. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic 
effects was found. Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration 
in rabbits gave no remarkable findings. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous 
administration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen 
(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical 
activity and life-style. 
Daily doses and timing of administration 
There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 
0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total 
daily requirement. Insuman Basal is injected subcutaneously 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses. 
Secondary dose adjustment 
Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin 
requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if 
- 
- 
- 
the patient's weight changes, 
the patient's life-style changes, 
other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or 
hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly population (≧65 years old) 
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin 
requirements. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin 
metabolism. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced 
capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. 
Method of administration 
Insuman Basal must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
Insuman Basal is administered subcutaneously. Insuman Basal must never be injected intravenously. 
Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection 
area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection 
area must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and 
cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Insuman Basal 40 IU/ml in a vial 
Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection 
syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). 
Insuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The 
injection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). 
Insuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Insuman Basal 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. 
If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Insuman Basal SoloStar100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Insuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Patients hypersensitive to Insuman Basal for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must 
only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with 
anti-allergic treatment. 
In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer 
to Insuman Basal, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. 
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's 
adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all 
other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. 
Transfer to Insuman Basal 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), 
origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need 
for a change in dose. 
The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, 
it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. 
Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in 
particular in patients who 
- 
- 
- 
were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, 
have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, 
previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In 
patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under 
medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption 
and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in 
the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose 
monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic 
medications may be considered. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. 
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in 
patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients 
with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of 
cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative 
retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following 
hypoglycaemia). 
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. 
The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain 
risk groups. These include patients: 
- 
- 
in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, 
in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
who are elderly, 
- 
after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, 
- 
in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, 
- 
with a long history of diabetes, 
- 
suffering from a psychiatric illness, 
- 
- 
receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the 
patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. 
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, 
unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. 
Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and 
awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors 
increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may 
necessitate dose adjustment. These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
change in the injection area, 
improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), 
unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, 
intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), 
inadequate food intake, 
missed meals, 
alcohol consumption, 
certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency), 
concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
- 
Intercurrent illness 
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are 
indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often 
increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of 
carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. 
and they must never omit insulin entirely. 
Insuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Pens to be used with Insuman Basal 100 IU/ml in cartridges 
Insuman Basal 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. 
If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
The Insuman Basal cartridges should only be used with the following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Basal in 0.5 unit dose increments 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, and AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Basal in 1 
unit dose increments. 
These cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been 
established with the listed pens. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country (see section 4.2 and 6.6). 
Insuman Basal SoloStar100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Handling of the pen 
Insuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. 
SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). 
Medication errors 
Medication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been 
accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid 
medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Combination of Insuman with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), 
phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine 
[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the 
placental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Basal can be used during breast-feeding. 
Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the 
insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed 
use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency 
can be presented. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ 
class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10);

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. 
Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such 
anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to 
hyper- or hypoglycaemia. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. 
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic 
counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more 
marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. 
Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is 
improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Eyes disorders 
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary 
alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. 
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be 
associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to 
reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms 
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. 
Management 
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose 
regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. 
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate 
intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical 
recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, 
intermediate-acting, ATC Code: A10AC01. 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin 
- 
- 
lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, 
increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles 
and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, 
increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, 
promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, 
- 
- 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Insuman Basal (an isophane insulin suspension) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of 
action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 60 minutes, the phase of maximum 
action is between 3 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 11 to 20 hours. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin 
do not reflect its metabolic action. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic 
effects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in 
rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
Insuman Basal 40 IU/ml in a vial, Insuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Before withdrawing insulin from the vial for the first time, remove the plastic protective cap. 
Immediately before withdrawal from the vial into the injection syringe, the insulin must be 
resuspended. This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. 
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted 
appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the 
dose. 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Basal must not be used 
if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or 
flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes 
give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be 
used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially. 
Insuman Basal must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
It must be remembered that insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Basal may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed 
specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. 
If two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the 
shorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting 
preparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Insuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Insulin pen 
Insuman Basal 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Insuman Basal cartridges are 
to be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar , AllStar PRO or 
JuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. 
The manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
Cartridges 
Before insertion into the pen, Insuman Basal must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and 
then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth 
(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough 
mixing of the contents. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Later on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior 
to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Basal must not be used 
if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or 
flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes 
sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge yielding a uniform 
suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement 
changes substantially. 
Air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). 
Empty cartridges must not be refilled. 
Insuman Basal must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
It must be remembered that insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Basal cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Insuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Insuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Before first use, Insuman Basal must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then 
resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least 
ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of 
the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Basal must not be used 
if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or 
flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes 
sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform 
suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes 
substantially. 
Empty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
It must be remembered that insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local

3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  
Suspension for injection. 
After resuspension, milky-white suspension. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen 
(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical 
activity and life-style. 
Daily doses and timing of administration 
There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 
0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total 
daily requirement. Insuman Comb 15 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary dose adjustment 
Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin 
requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if 
- 
- 
- 
the patient's weight changes, 
the patient's life-style changes, 
other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or 
hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly population (≧65 years old) 
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin 
requirements. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin 
metabolism. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced 
capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. 
Method of administration 
Insuman Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
Insuman Comb 15 is administered subcutaneously. Insuman Comb 15 must never be injected 
intravenously. 
Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection 
area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection 
area must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and 
cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Insuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The 
injection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). 
Insuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Insuman Com 15 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Patients hypersensitive to Insuman Comb 15 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must 
only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with 
anti-allergic treatment. 
In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer 
to Insuman Comb 15, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. 
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's 
adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all 
other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. 
Transfer to Insuman Comb 15 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), 
origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need 
for a change in dose. 
The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, 
it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. 
Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in 
particular in patients who 
- 
- 
- 
were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, 
have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, 
previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In 
patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under 
medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption 
and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in 
the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose 
monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic 
medications may be considered. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. 
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in 
patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients 
with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of 
cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative 
retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following 
hypoglycaemia). 
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. 
The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain 
risk groups. These include patients: 
in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, 
- 
in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, 
- 
who are elderly, 
- 
after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, 
- 
in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, 
- 
with a long history of diabetes, 
- 
suffering from a psychiatric illness, 
- 
- 
receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. 
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, 
unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. 
Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and 
awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors 
increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may 
necessitate dose adjustment. These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
change in the injection area, 
improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), 
unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, 
intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), 
inadequate food intake, 
missed meals, 
alcohol consumption, 
certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency), 
concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
- 
Intercurrent illness 
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are 
indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often 
increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of 
carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. 
and they must never omit insulin entirely. 
Insuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Pens to be used with Insuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in cartridges 
Insuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
The Insuman Com 15 cartridges should only be used with the following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Comb 15 in 0.5 unit dose increments 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Comb 15 in 1 
unit dose increments. 
These cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been 
established with the listed pens. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country (see section 4.2 and 6.6). 
Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Handling of the pen 
Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. 
SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). 
Medication errors 
Medication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been 
accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid 
medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. 
Combination of Insuman with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), 
phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine 
[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the 
placental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Comb 15 can be used during breast-feeding. 
Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the 
insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency 
can be presented. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class 
and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. 
Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such 
anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to 
hyper- or hypoglycaemia. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. 
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. 
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic 
counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more 
marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. 
Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is 
improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eyes disorders 
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary 
alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. 
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be 
associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to 
reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms 
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. 
Management 
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose 
regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. 
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate 
intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical 
recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, 
intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin 
- 
- 
lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, 
increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles 
and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, 
increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, 
promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, 
enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. 
- 
- 
- 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Insuman Comb 15 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 15% dissolved insulin) is an insulin 
with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is 
within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after injection and the 
duration of action is 11 to 20 hours. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin 
do not reflect its metabolic action. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic 
effects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in 
rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
Insuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Before withdrawing insulin from the vial for the first time, remove the plastic protective cap. 
Immediately before withdrawal from the vial into the injection syringe, the insulin must be 
resuspended. This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. 
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the 
dose. 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 15 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes 
give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be 
used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially. 
Insuman Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Comb 15 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed 
specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. 
If two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the 
shorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting 
preparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Insuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Insulin pen 
Insuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Insuman Comb 15 cartridges 
are to be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar, AllStar PRO 
or JuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. 
The manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
Cartridges 
Before insertion into the pen, Insuman Comb 15 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and 
then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth 
(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough 
mixing of the contents. 
Later on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior 
to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 15 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes 
sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge yielding a uniform 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement 
changes substantially. 
Air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). 
Empty cartridges must not be refilled. 
Insuman Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Comb 15 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Before first use, Insuman Comb 15 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then 
resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least 
ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of 
the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 15 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes 
sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform 
suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes 
substantially. 
Empty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Before using the SoloStar pre-filled pen, the Instructions for Use included in the package leaflet must 
be read carefully.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen 
(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical 
activity and life-style. 
Daily doses and timing of administration 
There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 
0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total 
daily requirement. Insuman Comb 25 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses. 
Secondary dose adjustment 
Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin 
requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if 
- 
- 
- 
the patient's weight changes, 
the patient's life-style changes, 
other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or 
hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly population (≧65 years old) 
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin 
requirements. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin 
metabolism. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced 
capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. 
Method of administration 
Insuman Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
Insuman Comb 25 is administered subcutaneously. Insuman Comb 25 must never be injected 
intravenously. 
Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection 
area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection 
area must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and 
cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Insuman Comb 25 40 IU/ml in a vial 
Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection 
syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). 
Insuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The 
injection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). 
Insuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Insuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6.

4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Patients hypersensitive to Insuman Comb 25 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must 
only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with 
anti-allergic treatment. 
In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer 
to Insuman Comb 25, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. 
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's 
adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all 
other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. 
Transfer to Insuman Comb 25 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), 
origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need 
for a change in dose. 
The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, 
it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. 
Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in 
particular in patients who 
- 
- 
- 
were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, 
have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, 
previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In 
patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under 
medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption 
and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in 
the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose 
monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic 
medications may be considered. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. 
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in 
patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients 
with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of 
cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative 
retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following 
hypoglycaemia). 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. 
The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain 
risk groups. These include patients: 
in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, 
- 
in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, 
- 
who are elderly, 
- 
after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, 
- 
in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, 
- 
with a long history of diabetes, 
- 
suffering from a psychiatric illness, 
- 
- 
receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the 
patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. 
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, 
unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. 
Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and 
awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors 
increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may 
necessitate dose adjustment. These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
change in the injection area, 
improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), 
unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, 
intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), 
inadequate food intake, 
missed meals, 
alcohol consumption, 
certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency), 
concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
- 
Intercurrent illness 
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are 
indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often 
increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of 
carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. 
and they must never omit insulin entirely. 
Insuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Pens to be used with Insuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in cartridges 
Insuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
The Insuman Comb 25 cartridges should only be used with the following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Comb 25 in 0.5 unit dose increments 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Comb 25 in 1 
unit dose increments. 
These cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been 
established with the listed pens. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country (see section 4.2 and 6.6). 
Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Handling of the pen 
Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. 
SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
Medication errors 
Medication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been 
accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid 
medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. 
Combination of Insuman with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), 
phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine 
[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the 
placental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Comb 25 can be used during breast-feeding. 
Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the 
insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed 
use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency 
can be presented.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. 
Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such 
anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to 
hyper- or hypoglycaemia. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. 
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. 
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic 
counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more 
marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. 
Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is 
improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Eyes disorders 
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary 
alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. 
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be 
associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to 
reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms 
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. 
Management 
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose 
regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. 
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate 
intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical 
recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes insulins and analogues for injection, 
intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin 
- 
- 
lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, 
increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles 
and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, 
increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, 
promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, 
enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. 
- 
- 
- 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Insuman Comb 25 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 25% dissolved insulin) is an insulin 
with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is 
within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after injection and the 
duration of action is 12 to 19 hours. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin 
do not reflect its metabolic action. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic 
effects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in 
rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
Insuman Comb 25 40 IU/ml in a vial, Insuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Before withdrawing insulin from the vial for the first time, remove the plastic protective cap. 
Immediately before withdrawal from the vial into the injection syringe, the insulin must be 
resuspended. This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. 
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted 
appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the 
dose. 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 25 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes 
give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be 
used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially. 
Insuman Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external implanted insulin pumps. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed 
specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. 
If two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the 
shorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting 
preparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Insuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Insulin pen 
Insuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
The Insuman Comb 25 cartridges are to be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 
24, Tactipen, AllStar, AllStar PRO or JuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be 
marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. 
The manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
Cartridges 
Before insertion into the pen, Insuman Comb 25 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and 
then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth 
(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough 
mixing of the contents. 
Later on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior 
to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 25 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes 
sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge yielding a uniform 
suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement 
changes substantially. 
Air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). 
Empty cartridges must not be refilled. 
Insuman Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Comb 25 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Before first use, Insuman Comb 25 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then 
resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least 
ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of 
the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 25 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes 
sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform 
suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes 
substantially. 
Empty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Before using the SoloStar pre-filled pen, the Instructions for Use included in the package leaflet must 
be read carefully.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  
Suspension for injection. 
After resuspension, milky-white suspension. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen 
(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical 
activity and life-style. 
Daily doses and timing of administration 
There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 
0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total 
daily requirement. Insuman Comb 30 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses.
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary dose adjustment 
Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin 
requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if 
- 
- 
- 
the patient's weight changes, 
the patient's life-style changes, 
other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or 
hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly population (≧65 years old) 
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin 
requirements. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin 
metabolism. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced 
capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. 
Method of administration 
Insuman Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
Insuman Comb 30 is administered subcutaneously. Insuman Comb 30 must never be injected 
intravenously. 
Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection 
area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection 
area must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and 
cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Insuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The 
injection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). 
Insuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Insuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients hypersensitive to Insuman Comb 30 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available 
must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction 
with anti-allergic treatment. 
In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer 
to Insuman Comb 30, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. 
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's 
adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all 
other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. 
Transfer to Insuman Comb 30 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting,etc.), 
origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need 
for a change in dose. 
The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, 
it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. 
Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in 
particular in patients who 
- 
- 
- 
were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, 
have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, 
previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In 
patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under 
medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption 
and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in 
the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose 
monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic 
medications may be considered. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. 
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in 
patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients 
with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of 
cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative 
retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following 
hypoglycaemia). 
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. 
The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain 
risk groups. These include patients: 
in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, 
- 
in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, 
- 
who are elderly, 
- 
after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, 
- 
in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, 
- 
with a long history of diabetes, 
- 
suffering from a psychiatric illness, 
- 
- 
receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. 
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, 
unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. 
Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and 
awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors 
increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may 
necessitate dose adjustment. These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
change in the injection area, 
improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), 
unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, 
intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), 
inadequate food intake, 
missed meals, 
alcohol consumption, 
certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency), 
concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
- 
Intercurrent illness 
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are 
indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often 
increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of 
carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. 
and they must never omit insulin entirely. 
Insuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Pens to be used with Insuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in cartridges 
Insuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
The Insuman Comb 30 cartridges should only be used with the following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Comb 30 in 0.5 unit dose increments 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Comb 30 in 1 
unit dose increments. 
These cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been 
established with the listed pens. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country(see section 4.2 and 6.6). 
Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Handling of the pen 
Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. 
SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). 
Medication errors 
Medication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been 
accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid 
medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. 
Combination of Insuman with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.

Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), 
phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine 
[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the 
placental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Comb 30 can be used during breast-feeding. 
Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed 
use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency 
can be presented.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. 
Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such 
anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to 
hyper- or hypoglycaemia. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. 
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. 
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic 
counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more 
marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. 
Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is 
improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Eyes disorders 
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary 
alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. 
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be 
associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to 
reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms 
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. 
Management 
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose 
regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. 
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate 
intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical 
recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, 
intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin 
- 
- 
lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, 
increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles 
and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, 
increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, 
promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, 
enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. 
- 
- 
- 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Insuman Comb 30 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 30% dissolved insulin) is an insulin 
with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is 
within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after injection and the 
duration of action is 12 to 19 hours. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
do not reflect its metabolic action. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic 
effects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in 
rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
Insuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Before withdrawing insulin from the vial for the first time, remove the plastic protective cap. 
Immediately before withdrawal from the vial into the injection syringe, the insulin must be 
resuspended. This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. 
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted 
appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the 
dose. 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 30 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be 
used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially. 
Insuman Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Comb 30 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed 
specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. 
If two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the 
shorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting 
preparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Insuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Insulin pen 
Insuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Insuman Comb 30 cartridges 
are to be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar , AllStar PRO 
or JuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. 
The manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
Cartridges 
Before insertion into the pen, Insuman Comb 30 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and 
then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth 
(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough 
mixing of the contents. 
Later on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior 
to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 30 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes 
sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge yielding a uniform 
suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement 
changes substantially. 
Air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). 
Empty cartridges must not be refilled. 
Insuman Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Comb 30 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Before first use, Insuman Comb 30 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then 
resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least 
ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of 
the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 30 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes 
sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform 
suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes 
substantially. 
Empty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Before using the SoloStar pre-filled pen, the Instructions for Use included in the package leaflet must 
be read carefully.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  
Suspension for injection. 
After resuspension, milky-white suspension. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen 
(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical 
activity and life-style. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Daily doses and timing of administration 
There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 
0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total 
daily requirement. Insuman Comb 50 is injected subcutaneously 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. 
Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses. 
Secondary dose adjustment 
Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin 
requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if 
- 
- 
- 
the patient's weight changes, 
the patient's life-style changes, 
other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or 
hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly population (≧65 years old) 
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin 
requirements. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin 
metabolism. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced 
capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. 
Method of administration 
Insuman Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
Insuman Comb 50 is administered subcutaneously. Insuman Comb 50 must never be injected 
intravenously. 
Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection 
area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection 
area must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and 
cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Insuman Comb 50 40 IU/ml in a vial 
Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection 
syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). 
Insuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The 
injection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). 
Insuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Insuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Patients hypersensitive to Insuman Comb 50 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must 
only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with 
anti-allergic treatment. 
In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer 
to Insuman Comb 50, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. 
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's 
adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all 
other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. 
Transfer to Insuman Comb 50 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), 
origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need 
for a change in dose. 
The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, 
it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. 
Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in 
particular in patients who 
- 
- 
- 
were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, 
have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, 
previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In 
patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under 
medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption 
and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in 
the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose 
monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic 
medications may be considered. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. 
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in 
patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients 
with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of 
cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative 
retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following 
hypoglycaemia). 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. 
The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain 
risk groups. These include patients: 
in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, 
- 
in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, 
- 
who are elderly, 
- 
after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, 
- 
in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, 
- 
with a long history of diabetes, 
- 
suffering from a psychiatric illness, 
- 
- 
receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the 
patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. 
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, 
unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. 
Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and 
awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors 
increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may 
necessitate dose adjustment. These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
change in the injection area, 
improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), 
unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, 
intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), 
inadequate food intake, 
missed meals, 
alcohol consumption, 
certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency), 
concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
- 
Intercurrent illness 
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are 
indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often 
increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of 
carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. 
and they must never omit insulin entirely. 
Insuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Pens to be used with Insuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in cartridges 
Insuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
The Insuman Comb 50 cartridges should only be used with the following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Comb 50 in 0.5 unit dose increments 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Comb 50 in 1 
unit dose increments. 
These cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been 
established with the listed pens. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country (see section 4.2 and 6.6). 
Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Handling of the pen 
Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. 
SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medication errors 
Medication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been 
accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid 
medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. 
Combination of Insuman with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), 
phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine 
[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the 
placental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Comb 50 can be used during breast-feeding. 
Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the 
insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed 
use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency 
can be presented. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ 
class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10);

Immune system disorders 
Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such 
anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to 
hyper- or hypoglycaemia. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. 
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. 
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic 
counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more 
marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. 
Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is 
improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Eyes disorders 
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary 
alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. 
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be 
associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to 
reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms 
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. 
Management 
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose 
regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. 
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate 
intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical 
recovery.

Mechanism of action 
Insulin 
- 
- 
lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, 
increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles 
and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, 
increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, 
promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, 
enhances the uptake of potassium into cells.

Insuman Comb 50 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 50% dissolved insulin) is an insulin 
with rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of 
action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1.5 and 4 hours after injection 
and the duration of action is 12 to 16 hours. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin 
do not reflect its metabolic action. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic 
effects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in 
rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
Insuman Comb 50 40 IU/ml in a vial, Insuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Before withdrawing insulin from the vial for the first time, remove the plastic protective cap. 
Immediately before withdrawal from the vial into the injection syringe, the insulin must be 
resuspended. This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. 
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted 
appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the 
dose. 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 50 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes 
give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be 
used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially. 
Insuman Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed 
specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. 
If two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the 
shorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting 
preparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Insuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a cartridge 
Insulin pen 
Insuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable 
pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Insuman comb 50 cartridges 
are to be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar, AllStar PRO 
or JuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. 
The manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
Cartridges 
Before insertion into the pen, Insuman Comb 50 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and 
then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth 
(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough 
mixing of the contents. 
Later on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior 
to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 50 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles 
or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes 
sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge yielding a uniform 
suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement 
changes substantially. 
Air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). 
Empty cartridges must not be refilled. 
Insuman Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or 
external or implanted insulin pumps. 
It must be remembered that 
- 
- 
insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, 
the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
human and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing of insulins 
Insuman Comb 50 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen 
Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Before first use, Insuman Comb 50 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then 
resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least 
ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of 
the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. 
After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 50 must not be 
used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles

1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  
Insuman Infusat 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a vial  
2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  
Insuman Infusat 100 IU/ml in a vial 
Each ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). 
Each vial contains 10 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. 
One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin*. 
Insuman Infusat is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin). 
* Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  
Solution for injection . 
Clear, colourless solution. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Insuman Infusat has been specially designed for use in external portable insulin pumps. It is specially 
stabilised to minimise loss of efficacy which may result from mechanical and thermal stress in such 
pumps. Insuman Infusat is therefore also suitable for continuous insulin infusion with other, 
conventional injection syringe pumps. 
The desired blood glucose levels and the insulin dose regimen must be determined individually and 
adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. 
Daily doses and timing of administration 
When used in external portable insulin pumps, part of the daily insulin dose is infused continuously 
("basal rate"), and the rest is administered in the form of bolus injections before meals. Refer to the 
operating instructions for detailed information about the infusion pump, its functions and the necessary 
safety precautions. 
There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 
0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total 
84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
daily requirement. Consequently, about 40% to 60% of the daily dose is administered at a basal rate, 
and the rest is given as bolus injections before meals. 
Secondary dose adjustment 
Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin 
requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if 
- 
- 
- 
the patient's weight changes, 
the patient's life-style changes, 
other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or 
hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly population (≧65 years old) 
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin 
requirements. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin 
metabolism. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced 
capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. 
Method of administration 
Insuman Infusat must not be used in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Refer to the technical 
manual for contraindications relating to the use of insulin pumps. 
Insuman Infusat may be infused by the subcutaneous route.  
Insuman Infusat in a vial may also be used in other insulin pumps for which it has been shown that 
they are suitable for this insulin (see pump manual). 
Only tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene catheters must be used. 
Insulin must always be infused under aseptic conditions. This is facilitated by the special equipment 
available for the insulin pumps (e.g. catheters, cannulas). 
Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection 
area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). The puncture site within a given 
injection area must be changed regularly (generally, every 1 to 3 days) in order to reduce the risk of 
lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Patients hypersensitive to Insuman Infusat for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must 
only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with 
anti-allergic treatment. 
85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer 
to Insuman Infusat, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. 
In case of hypoglycaemia, the insulin pump should temporarily be turned off, at least until the patient 
has recovered complete consciousness. 
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's 
adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all 
other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. 
Transfer to Insuman Infusat 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), 
origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need 
for a change in dose. 
The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, 
it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. 
Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in 
particular in patients who 
- 
- 
- 
were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, 
have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, 
previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In 
patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under 
medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption 
and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in 
the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose 
monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic 
medications may be considered. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. 
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in 
patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients 
with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of 
cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative 
retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following 
hypoglycaemia). 
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. 
The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain 
risk groups. These include patients: 
in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, 
- 
in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, 
- 
who are elderly, 
- 
after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, 
- 
in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, 
- 
with a long history of diabetes, 
- 
suffering from a psychiatric illness, 
- 
receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
- 
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the 
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. 
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, 
unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. 
Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and 
awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors 
increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may 
necessitate dose adjustment. These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
change in the injection area, 
improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), 
unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, 
intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), 
inadequate food intake, 
missed meals, 
alcohol consumption, 
certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency), 
concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
- 
Insulin pump faults 
Hyperglycaemia, ketoacidosis and coma may develop within hours if the pump catheter is obstructed 
completely. Whenever the patient notices a rapid increase in blood glucose which does not respond to a 
bolus dose, a check must be made for possible catheter obstruction. 
In the event of a pump malfunction, patients must always have injection devices (injection syringe or 
pen) and insulin available for subcutaneous injection. For details on safety precautions in the use of 
insulin pumps, refer to the operator’s manual. 
Intercurrent illness 
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are 
indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often 
increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of 
carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. 
and they must never omit insulin entirely. 
Medication errors 
Medication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been 
accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid 
medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. 
Combination of Insuman with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), 
phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine 
[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the 
placental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Infusat can be used during breast-feeding. 
Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the 
insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed 
use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency 
can be presented. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. 
Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such 
anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to 
hyper- or hypoglycaemia. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. 
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. 
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic 
counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more 
marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. 
Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is 
improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Eyes disorders 
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary 
alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. 
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be 
associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to 
reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms 
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. 
Management 
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose 
regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. 
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate 
intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical 
recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, 
ATC Code: A10AB01. 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin 
- 
- 
lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, 
increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in themuscles 
and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, 
increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, 
promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, 
enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. 
- 
- 
- 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Insuman Infusat is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin 
do not reflect its metabolic action. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic 
effects was found. Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration 
in rabbits gave no remarkable findings. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous 
administration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions.

3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  
Solution for infusion (infusion). 
Clear, colourless solution. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Insuman Implantable is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus that 
cannot be controlled with subcutaneous insulin (including pump) therapy, presenting with frequent, 
otherwise unexplained severe hyper-and/or hypoglycaemia. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
The prescription of this medicinal product is restricted to centres certified by Medtronic as having 
received adequate training in the use of the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. 
Use of Insuman Implantable should be supervised by a physician experienced in diabetes and 
competent in using intraperitoneal insulin. 
Posology 
The desired blood glucose levels and the insulin dose regimen must be determined individually and 
adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical activity and life-style. Frequent adjustments of insulin doses 
under strict medical supervision are often required for several weeks following pump implantation. 
The pump is not connected to a glucose meter, and as such, patients are advised to practice good 
diabetes self management and test their own blood glucose levels at least four times daily to detect 
potential malfunction of the pump, to monitor glycaemic control and to determine required insulin 
doses. 
Daily doses and timing of administration 
There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. A part of the daily insulin dose ("basal rate") is 
infused continuously by the implantable pump and the remaining part of the daily dose is administered 
by the patient, using the same pump, as a bolus before meals. The basal metabolic requirement is 
usually 40% to 60% of the total daily insulin requirement. Changes in basal and bolus doses are 
controlled by means of a small, hand held unit (Personal Pump Communicator (PPC)) which 
communicates with the pump via radio waves. The detailed operating instructions about the 
93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
implantable pump, its functions and the necessary safety precautions are described in the Physician’s 
Manual accompanying the infusion pump. 
Time of refill of insulin pump 
The refill procedure should be performed every 40 to 45 days. The time between two refill procedures 
cannot exceed 45 days for insulin in-use stability reasons. Patients may require more frequent refill 
procedures based on their insulin needs. 
Change to Insuman Implantable 
Dose regimen adjustment may be necessary when changing patients from one insulin preparation to 
another. This applies, for example, when changing from: 
• 
• 
• 
The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. 
Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. 
an animal insulin (especially a bovine insulin) to human insulin, 
one human insulin preparation to another, 
a regimen with only regular insulin to one with a longer-acting insulin. 
Following the change from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose reduction may be required in 
particular in patients who: 
• 
• 
• 
were already controlled with relatively low blood glucose levels, 
have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, 
previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. 
In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transition 
under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. 
Secondary dose adjustment 
Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin 
requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if: 
• 
• 
• 
the patient's weight changes, 
the patient's life-style changes, 
other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or 
hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly population (≥65 years old) 
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin 
requirements. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin 
metabolism. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced 
capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available. Therefore, the safety and efficacy of Insuman Implantable (intraperitoneal use) 
have not been established in paediatric patients. In patients who have not reached adult size, Insuman 
Implantable is contraindicated (see section 4.3 and 4.4). 
94 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method of administration 
Insuman Implantable is to be used in the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable pump only. 
Insuman Implantable is for intraperitoneal use only. Other routes of administration (e.g. injection) are 
contraindicated. 
Insuman Implantable has been designed only for intraperitoneal use with the Medtronic MiniMed 
Implantable Pump supplied by Medtronic MiniMed which delivers insulin directly into the peritoneal 
cavity. 
Insuman Implantable must not be used with any other pumps (external or implantable) than the 
Medtronic MiniMed Implantable pump or with any other medical devices including syringes (see 
section 6.6). 
Pump refill 
The pump refill procedure should be performed using sterile technique and this should take place in 
the centres certified by Medtronic. Reservoir refilling must be performed by trained and qualified 
personnel in accordance with the instructions provided by the pump manufacturer. The healthcare 
institution’s standard sterile operating procedures for skin preparation must be followed to avoid 
microbial contamination and infection. All solutions that will enter the pump must be properly 
degassed prior to filling the pump reservoir to avoid insulin aggregation and under-delivery. The vials 
of insulin should be withdrawn from the refrigerator and stored at room temperature in the outer carton 
in order to protect from light for a minimum of 4 hours and no longer than 24 hours before use. The 
insulin solution must be then degassed according to the degassing procedure described in the 
Physician’s manual. 
In this refilling procedure the remaining insulin must be removed from the pump and the pump refilled 
with new insulin. The reservoir is completely filled (approximately 15 ml or 6,000 units of Insuman 
Implantable), independently of the patients needs. Residual insulin and new insulin must be weighed 
to record the refill worksheet and calculate the refill accuracy criterion. For further details on handling 
see section 6.6 and instructions provided in the Physician’s manual. 
Rinsing of the pump 
All solutions that will enter the pump must be properly degassed prior to filling the pump reservoir to 
avoid insulin aggregation and under-delivery. 
A rinse procedure using 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution is performed to dissolve insulin deposits 
within the pump reservoir, pumping mechanism and the side port catheter. It is recommended to 
perform the rinse procedure every 6 months. 
Rinsing may be performed earlier, for example if insulin under-delivery is revealed during a refill 
procedure or suspected due to insufficient blood glucose control. Diagnostic procedures must be 
performed to check if the problem is due to the pump or catheter. 
•  When under-delivery of insulin is due to catheter occlusion, the side port catheter may be 
flushed with 5-10 ml of sterile rinse buffer solution. 
•  When under-delivery is caused by a problem with the pump, a rinse procedure should be 
performed. 
For further details on handling see section 6.6 and instructions provided in the Physician’s manual. 
Insuman Implantable is a high-concentrated insulin formulation 
Insuman Implantable contains 400 international units of insulin in each ml. 
The label on the insulin vial should be checked before use to make sure this is the correct insulin for 
the intended route of administration. 
Patients should be informed about the high concentration of insulin in Insuman Implantable 
(400 IU/ml) compared to other insulins in vials or cartridges (usually 100 IU/ml). 
Mixing of insulin 
Insuman Implantable must not be mixed with any other insulin or with insulin analogues. 
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.3  Contraindications  
Insuman Implantable 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Other routes of administration (e.g. injection). 
Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump 
Hypersensitivity to titanium alloy, polysulfone or silicone materials used in the implanted components 
of the pump. 
Use of other insulin medicinal products with the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. 
Use in paediatric patients who have not reached adult size due to the large size of the pump (see 
section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Implantation of the pump in patients who reside permanently at elevations above 2439 meters 
(8000 feet) (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the 
administered product should be clearly recorded. 
The Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump should not be implanted in patients who have medical or 
mental conditions that make them unable to program modifications to the pump based on glucose 
readings or to take appropriate corrective actions in case of pump system problems. 
Patients implanted with a Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump must receive comprehensive 
instruction in the use of the pump, and the necessary actions in case of illness, hypoglycaemia and 
hyperglycaemia or pump failure. The patient should read and follow the instructions in the Patient 
Manual accompanying the infusion pump. For further details on handling see section 6.6. 
Medical imaging technique 
Patients who expect to need frequent or routine MRI or therapeutic ultrasound should not be implanted 
with the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. 
Hypersensitivity 
Patients hypersensitive to Insuman Implantable for whom no better tolerated preparation is available 
must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – if necessary – in conjunction with 
anti-allergic treatment. 
In patients with an allergy to animal insulin, intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to 
changing to Insuman Implantable, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. 
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's 
adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before 
dose adjustment is considered. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. 
Clinically relevant over-delivery of insulin was not observed during a 4 year period of evaluation of 
the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump; however, this does not exclude the potential for such an 
occurrence. 
In case of severe hypoglycaemia, patients should immediately contact their physician trained to 
perform pump investigations and the pump should then be investigated by the physician for possible 
catheter occlusion leading to accumulation of insulin with subsequent release of this accumulated 
insulin (see section 6.6). 
During a refill procedure, a very small amount of insulin may be deposited subcutaneously, possibly 
resulting in hypoglycaemia. Patients must be informed to closely monitor blood glucose levels on 
refill days (see section 6.6). 
96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in 
patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients 
with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of 
cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative 
retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following 
hypoglycaemia). 
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are 
diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be 
absent in certain risk groups. These include patients: 
in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, 
• 
in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, 
• 
who are elderly, 
• 
after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, 
• 
in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, 
• 
with a long history of diabetes, 
• 
suffering from a psychiatric illness, 
• 
• 
receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the 
patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. 
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, 
unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. 
Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and 
awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors 
increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may 
necessitate dose adjustment. These include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
improved insulin sensitivity (e.g., by removal of stress factors), 
unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, 
intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), 
inadequate food intake, 
missed meals, 
alcohol consumption, 
certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency), 
concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
• 
Hyperglycaemia 
It is known that insulin can form aggregates, fibrils and gel-like structures when it is subjected to 
chemical and/or physical stress, e.g. increased temperatures and shaking. This can lead to obstruction 
of the implantable pump and under-delivery of insulin. Hyperglycaemia, ketoacidosis or coma may 
develop within hours in case of malfunction of the pump system. As soon as patients notice a rapid 
increase in blood glucose, which does not respond to a bolus dose of insulin, the possibility of pump 
obstruction should be investigated by a physician trained to perform pump investigations. 
The patient should correct resistant hyperglycaemia with a standard dose of subcutaneous insulin. 
Rinsing of pump to avoid insulin under-delivery 
To avoid under-delivery which may occur when insulin deposits collect in the pumping mechanism 
inside the pump, it is recommended to follow a rinse procedure every 6 months. Rinsing may be 
performed earlier, for example, when potential under-delivery is suspected based on a calculated refill 
accuracy of less than 85%. Potential under-delivery of insulin by the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable 
Pump may result in an increase in daily programmed insulin usage, difficulty maintaining 
euglycaemia, refractory hyperglycaemia, and steady decrease in refill accuracy. Please refer to section 
6.6 and the Physician’s Manual, which describe how to diagnose potential pump system problems that 
may cause insulin under-delivery, and how to correct and prevent under-delivery. 
97 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of adverse reactions associated with the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump can be 
prevented by the rinse procedure by physicians. Patients should practice good diabetes self care and 
check their blood glucose a minimum of 4 times daily to detect and prevent hyperglycemia and 
possible diabetic ketoacidosis due to pump under-delivery. 
The patient plays a significant role in diagnosing and correcting hyperglycemia linked to pump 
performance problems. Should pump performance change, the patient would be able to detect a 
change in blood glucose levels. 
In case of malfunction of the pump, patients should always have available injection devices (syringe or 
pen) and insulin suitable for subcutaneous injection. 
Travel 
The Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump is not designed for use at elevations above 2439 meters 
(8000 feet) or below 7.6 meters (25 feet). Use of the pump at these altitudes may result in insulin 
over-delivery or under-delivery. 
Patients who reside permanently at elevations above 2439 meters (8000 feet) must not be implanted 
(see section 4.3). 
Patients who plan to reside at or travel (other than by pressurised commercial aircraft) at elevations 
above 2439 meters (8000 feet) or to dive below 7.6 meters (25 feet) should be informed on the actions 
to be taken. The pump reservoir and Side Port catheter must be emptied of insulin and the patients 
must self-administer insulin by subcutaneous injection for the duration of the trip and until their pump 
reservoir is refilled. 
The patient should be advised by the physician what needs to be done in case of travel, e.g. what to do 
if the pump malfunctions, availability of insulin and facility to replace the insulin, and who to contact 
in case of emergency. The patient should also be provided with alternative means of supplying insulin, 
e.g. provide the patient with 100 IU/ml insulin, devices, and supplies for subcutaneous injections. 
Infection of the pump pocket 
All procedures must be performed under sterile conditions. To avoid microbial contamination and 
infection, aseptic skin preparation should be performed according to the healthcare institution’s 
standard sterile operating procedures. In addition, antibiotic prophylactic measures are required before 
and after pump implantation to reduce the risk of pump pocket infection. Failure to do so may result in 
pump pocket infection and subsequent pump explantation (see section 4.8). 
Skin erosion 
The implantable pump may erode through the skin, resulting in infection of the implant site and pump 
explantation. The risk of skin erosion at the pump implantation site can be reduced by selecting an 
appropriate implant site, maintaining good sterile technique during the implant procedure, 
prophylactic antibiotic therapy and by continuously wearing an abdominal binder until the capsule has 
formed (about 1 month) (see section 4.8). 
Abnormal healing 
Abnormal healing can occur at the surgical incision site after device implantation. This can be reduced 
by continuously wearing an abdominal binder until the capsule has formed (about 1 month) and 
limiting patient activities immediately following device implant. 
Focal hepatic steatosis 
Focal hepatic steatosis has been observed after administration of insulin via the intra-peritoneal route, 
when the catheter was positioned very close to or in the liver capsule. After stopping insulin infusion 
or removal or repositioning of the peritoneal catheter, focal hepatic steatosis seems to be reversible 
and without clinical consequence (see section 4.8). 
Antibodies to insulin 
The presence of antibodies has been reported in patients after treatment using the Medtronic MiniMed 
Implantable Pump. Insulin administration via the intraperitoneal route is likely to cause formation of 
anti-insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the 
insulin dose to correct a tendency for hyper- or hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). 
98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Intercurrent illness 
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones 
are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often 
increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of 
carbohydrates (food or beverage) on a regular basis; even if they are able to eat only little or no food, 
or are vomiting, etc., and they must never omit insulin entirely. 
Medication errors 
Medication errors involving mix-up between subcutaneous Insuman formulations or other 
subcutaneous insulins have been reported. Insulin label must always be checked before each 
administration to avoid medication errors between Insuman Implantable and other insulins (see section 
6.6). 
Paediatric population 
Due to the large size of the implantable pump, use of Insuman Implantable in paediatric patients who 
have not reached adult size is contraindicated (see section 4.2 and 4.3). 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), 
phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine 
[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. 
Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
For insulin human administered via subcutaneous route, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are 
available. Insulin does not cross the placental barrier. 
For Insuman Implantable administered via the intraperitoneal pump, the safety profile has not been 
established in pregnancy. 
Women of childbearing potential, implanted or candidates for implantation, should inform their 
physician if they are contemplating pregnancy. 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. Insuman Implantable should not be 
used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with Insuman 
Implantable. 
99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the breastfed child are anticipated. Insuman Implantable can be used during 
breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the 
insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. The frequency of this reaction varies 
with patient population and dose regimens. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
From experience gained in a 6-month comparative phase III study (HUBIN_L_05335) with Insuman 
Implantable administered via the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump in 84 patients aged 26 to

Description of selected adverse reactions: 
Immune system disorders 
Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. 
Anti-insulin antibodies: Limited data from a clinical trial with intraperitoneal administration of 
Insuman Implantable do not suggest that elevated levels of insulin antibodies are commonly associated 
with insulin antibody syndrome or serious adverse events (see section 4.4). 
101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or 
severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. 
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic 
counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more 
marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. 
Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is 
improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Eye disorders 
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary 
alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. 
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be 
associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Focal hepatic steatosis has been reported in few patients receiving the semi-synthetic human insulin, 
when the catheter was in very close proximity to the liver. 
When the catheter tip is fixed in the liver capsule, administration of insulin via the intra-peritoneal 
route is associated with an increased risk of focal hepatic steatosis (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms 
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. 
Management 
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose 
regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. 
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate 
intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical 
recovery. 
The physician must program specific limitations for insulin basal insulin rates, bolus delivery 
amounts. These limitations are necessary to provide some control over patients' ability to program 
their insulin regimens and to avoid the possibility of overdosing. In addition, if patients are attempting 
to deliver more than 2.5 times the programmed maximum bolus amount within a one hour period, the 
PPC will display the “HOURLY MAX EXCEEDED” message to warn the patients. Detailed 
instructions on programming these limitations are contained in the Physician’s Manual. 
In case of severe hypoglycaemia, the pump should be investigated by the treating physician for 
possible catheter occlusion leading to accumulation of insulin with subsequent release of this 
accumulated insulin (see sections 4.4 and 6.6). 
102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During a refill procedure, a very small amount of insulin may be deposited subcutaneously, possibly 
resulting in hypoglycaemia. Patients must be informed to closely monitor blood glucose levels on 
refill days (see section 6.6).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting. 
ATC Code: A10AB01. 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin 
− 
− 
lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, 
increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles 
and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, 
increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, 
promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, 
enhances the uptake of potassium into cells.

Pharmacodynamic effects 
Insuman Implantable is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
A single-blind, randomised, 6-month controlled clinical study (HUBIN_L_05335) was conducted to 
evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Insuman Implantable compared to a semi-synthetic human 
insulin (400 IU/ml) administered via the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. The study included 
168 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, previously treated with the semi-synthetic human insulin. 
Before initial pump implantation, 72.4% of these patients had been treated by continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and 17.8% by subcutaneous multi-injection. Reasons for 
initiation of continuous intra-peritoneal insulin infusion (CIPII) were brittle diabetes in 62.7%, 
hypoglycaemia in 29.2%, insulin peripheral resistance in 5.0% and hypoglycaemia and brittle diabetes 
in 3.1%. At study initiation, half of the patients were switched to Insuman Implantable, while the other 
half remained on the semi-synthetic human insulin. The co-primary endpoint was change in HbA1c 
from baseline and the pump refill accuracy after 4 refill cycles (162 ± 21 days). Based on the change 
in HbA1c values from baseline, the glycaemic control in patients treated with Insuman Implantable 
was similar to that of patients treated with semi-synthetic human insulin. (per protocol population: 
-0.25 versus -0.12; [95% CI: -0.36; 0.11]). In addition, use of Insuman Implantable in continuous 
intraperitoneal infusion resulted in stable glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(per protocol population: mean reduction: -0.25 ± 0.67; [95% CI: -0.36; 0.11]) without increasing the 
risk of severe hypoglycaemia compared to semi-synthetic human insulin (14.3% versus 13.1%). 
Insuman Implantable administered in continuous intraperitoneal infusion was also similar to 
semi-synthetic human insulin as demonstrated by the refill accuracy criteria over the 4-refill cycles 
(per protocol population: mean difference: -3.15 ± 1.34; [95% CI: -5.81; -0.50]). 
There was an additional 12-month open-label randomised controlled study (MIP 310) to assess the 
effect of intraperitoneal insulin administration versus subcutaneous insulin administration on 
glycaemic control and the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia. All patients were naive to 
intraperitoneal insulin and had failed to improve their HbA1c within 3 months of intensive therapy 
with either multiple daily injection or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Mean HbA1c value at 
baseline was 8.1%. Patients enrolled in the continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion group received 
The semi-synthetic human insulin 400 IU/ml for 180 days followed by Insuman Implantable 
400 IU/ml for a further 180 days. Intraperitoneal insulin administration was similar to subcutaneous 
administration as demonstrated by change in HbA1c value from baseline (for continuous 
intraperitoneal administration: HbA1c value at Day 360 was 7.78 ± 1.04 versus 8.06 ± 0.77 at 
103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline; for subcutaneous administration: HbA1c value at Day 360 was 8.19 ± 0.87 versus 
8.12 ± 0.76 at baseline). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
In literature, insulin pharmacokinetics are generally described to be reproducible in patients with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving short-term and long-term continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion. 
Continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion results in earlier, shorter and higher peaks of plasma free 
insulin than continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. 
Continuous infusion via the intraperitoneal and intravenous routes (combined data) resulted in higher 
plasma free insulin Cmax values than multiple daily subcutaneous injections and continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion via an external pump (combined data) in patients with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus. 
All of the findings suggest that continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion in patients with type 1 
diabetes mellitus, compared with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and multiple daily 
injections is more similar to the pharmacokinetics of endogenous insulin observed. 
No food effect is expected on Cmax, Tmax and AUC values following CIPII administration. 
In a phase III study (HUBIN_L_05335) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the pharmacokinetic 
profile of Insuman Implantable after intraperitoneal administration of an insulin bolus was assessed in 
10 patients after intraperitoneal administration. 
Absorption 
After intraperitoneal administration of Insuman Implantable 0.15 IU/kg, the median Tmax was 
0.54 hours and Cmax in serum was 210 ± 129 microIU/ml. 
The mean pharmacokinetic profile is shown in figure 1.

5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Acute toxicity of insulin human was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No 
evidence of toxic effects was found. 
No non-clinical studies assessing the potential toxicity of Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml 
administered via intraperitoneal route were performed. However, three studies were conducted in rats 
to assess the potential toxicity of administration of human insulin via the intraperitoneal route. In a 
single-dose study in rats, a semi-synthetic insulin human in a formulation with 400 IU/ml and 
excipients identical to the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml formulation was administered by 
intraperitoneal injection. No clinical symptoms, macroscopically visible changes or irritations in the 
abdominal cavity were observed. In another study, rats also received the same semi-synthetic insulin 
via an intraperitoneally implanted osmotic mini-pump infusion for up to 6 weeks. No hepatic steatosis 
was observed. In a third study conducted in diabetic rats, administration of another human insulin with 
a formulation similar to Insuman via a catheter fixed to the liver capsule showed that intraperitoneal 
administration of high local insulin concentration at the liver capsule may induce reversible focal 
hepatic steatosis.

6.5  Nature and contents of container  
Colourless glass vial (type I) closed with flanged cap made of aluminium with tear-off lid and inserted 
sealing disk made of chlorobutyl rubber. 
Each vial contains 10 ml of solution. 
Packs of 1 and 5 vials. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
The solution must only be used if it is clear, colourless or almost colourless and practically free from 
visible particles. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each administration to avoid medication errors between 
Insuman Implantable and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Insuman Implantable must not be used with any other pumps (external or implantable) than the 
Medtronic MiniMed Implantable pump or with any other medical devices including syringes (see 
section 4.2). 
All procedures should be performed using sterile technique. Aseptic skin preparation should be 
performed according to the healthcare institution’s standard sterile operating procedures to avoid 
microbial contamination and infection. Failure to do so may result in pump pocket infection and 
subsequent pump explantation (see section 4.4). 
All solutions that will enter the pump must be properly degassed prior to filling the pump reservoir to 
avoid insulin aggregation and under-delivery.The vials of insulin should be withdrawn from the 
refrigerator and stored at room temperature in the outer carton in order to protect from light for a 
minimum of 4 hours and no longer than 24 hours before use, to ensure further efficient degassing by 
following the procedure described in the Physician’s manual. Failure to properly degas all fluids may 
introduce air in the pump causing insulin aggregation and under-delivery. 
Pump refill 
The pump reservoir stores about 6,000 units of insulin and requires a refill procedure every 40 to 
45 days for insulin in-use stability reasons in the pump or earlier based on the insulin needs of the 
patients. 
This procedure should always be scheduled in advance of PPC “low reservoir” or “empty reservoir” 
messages with the patient. 
Only Insuman Implantable which has been specifically formulated for use in the Medtronic MiniMed 
Implantable Pump should be used to fill the sterile pump reservoir. Two vials of Insuman Implantable 
(2 x 10 ml) are required to completely refill the pump reservoir and exclude air from entering the 
pump reservoir during the refill procedure. Any unused insulin should be disposed of in accordance 
with local requirements and should not be reused. 
Only the refill kit (syringe and stopcock), refill needles, port locating template supplied by Medtronic 
MiniMed and sterile rinse buffer solution manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH should 
be used with Insuman Implantable to refill the pump reservoir. 
During a refill procedure, never push in the refill syringe plunger to fill the pump. When the refill 
needle is properly seated in the pump fill port, then the vacuum in the pump reservoir will passively 
draw the insulin from the syringe into the pump reservoir. Failure of the insulin to enter the pump may 
indicate that the pump reservoir is still full. It may also indicate that the refill needle is not properly 
seated in the pump inlet valve. Pushing insulin in this circumstance could result in unintended insulin 
delivery to the subcutaneous tissue around the pump fill port. 
106 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During a refill procedure, a very small amount of insulin may be deposited subcutaneously, possibly 
resulting in hypoglycemia. Patients must be informed to closely monitor blood glucose levels on refill 
days. 
During the refill procedure it is important to fill out the refill worksheet and to calculate refill accuracy 
to evaluate system function. A calculated refill accuracy of less than 85% is indicative of insulin 
under-delivery. 
Detailed instructions on the refill procedure are contained in the Physician’s Manual. 
Insulin under-delivery 
Insulin under-delivery is suspected when: 
•  The patient reports an increase in insulin use to maintain euglycaemia. This can be verified by 
checking the insulin daily history on the PPC at each visit. 
•  Refractory hyperglycaemia occurs. 
•  A refill accuracy of less than 85% is calculated during a refill procedure. 
If insulin under-delivery is revealed during a refill procedure or suspected due to insufficient blood 
glucose control, diagnostic procedures must be performed to check if the problem is due to the pump 
(i.e. jammed pumping mechanism/backflow) or catheter (i.e. catheter occlusion). The stroke volume 
measurement procedure tests pump function, while a catheter flush procedure tests catheter patency. A 
stroke volume of between 0.42 μl to 0.58 μl without backflow is indicative of a catheter occlusion. 
Otherwise stroke volume values outside this range or the detection of backflow is indicative of a pump 
problem. 
Under-delivery of insulin caused by catheter occlusion 
Under-delivery caused by Side Port Catheter occlusion can occur either abruptly or gradually. The 
insulin usage and clinical symptoms may be identical to those of pump under-delivery. In addition, 
formation of a biofilm over the tip of the Side Port Catheter may cause latent hypoglycemia as the 
insulin programmed over time is trapped in the biofilm and is released after a sufficient volume of 
insulin has accumulated. A catheter flush procedure should be performed to clear the occlusion. 
The catheter is flushed by using 5-10 ml of sterile rinse buffer solution. 
Only the refill kit (syringe and stopcock), refill needles, port locating template supplied by Medtronic 
MiniMed and sterile rinse buffer solution manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH should 
be used with Insuman Implantable to flush the catheter. 
The catheter flush procedure should only be performed after confirming the stroke volume 
measurement. Failure to do this may cause permanent damage to the pump. 
During the catheter flush procedure 13 units of insulin are manually pushed through the catheter and 
delivered to the patient. The patient must be closely monitored for possible hypoglycaemia and 
administered intravenous glucose or glycogen as needed. 
After flushing and refill of the pump with insulin, about 13 units of the sterile rinse buffer solution will 
remain in the distal portion of the side port catheter. Depending on blood glucose values, an 
appropriate bolus amount must be programmed to remove the sterile rinse buffer solution from the 
catheter. The patient blood glucose levels must be monitored at least every 15 minutes following the 
flush. The patient should only be released once blood glucose levels are stable and within the safe 
range. 
If the flush procedure is unsuccessful, catheter replacement surgery is usually performed. 
Detailed instructions on the side port catheter flush procedure is contained in the Physician’s Manual. 
107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Under-delivery due to a problem with the pump 
A rinse procedure of the pump is performed to reverse this condition. 
The purpose of this procedure is to dissolve insulin deposits within the pump reservoir, pumping 
mechanism and the side port catheter using 0.1 M sodium hydroxide sterile solution supplied by 
Medtronic MiniMed. It is recommended to perform the rinse procedure every 6 months or as 
necessary based on the refill accuracy criterion. 
Only refill kit, refill needles, port locating template, 0.1 M sodium hydroxide sterile solution supplied 
by Medtronic MiniMed and sterile rinse buffer solution manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland 
GmbH should be used with Insuman Implantable to rinse the pump. 
If the rinse procedure fails to restore the stroke volume and accurate delivery, an extended rinse 
procedure needs to be performed. 
Only after successful restoration of the stroke volume measurement can the catheter be flushed with 
the sterile rinse buffer solution and the pump refilled with insulin. 
Detailed instructions on the rinse procedure are contained in the Physician’s Manual.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Rapid is and what it is used for  
Insuman Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process 
and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. 
Insuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. Insuman Rapid may also be used for treating hyperglycaemic coma 
(coma caused by too much blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the 
body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling blood sugar before, during and 
after surgery. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Rapid 
Do not use Insuman Rapid  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Rapid. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
206 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Rapid). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Rapid  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
207 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Rapid with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3.  How to use Insuman Rapid 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumstances, into a vein 
(blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Insulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires 
experience and special safety precautions. For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar 
setting. 
Do not use Insuman Rapid in insulin pumps – special insulin preparations are available for use in such 
devices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Rapid contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin 
concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other 
medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). 
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. 
Insuman Rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and 
has a water-like consistency. 
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to 
measure the correct dose. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or 
other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with 
insulin human preparations as detailed below. 
Insuman Rapid may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed 
for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues. 
209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a 
mixture, draw Insuman Rapid into the injection syringe before the other insulin. Inject as soon as you 
have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per 
ml). 
If you use more Insuman Rapid than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Rapid  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your 
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For 
information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
-  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Insuman Rapid  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Rapid without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Rapid and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
210 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site 
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
214 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heartbeat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Possible side effects 
How to store Insuman Rapid 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Rapid is and what it is used for  
Insuman Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process 
and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. 
Insuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. Insuman Rapid may also be used for treating hyperglycaemic coma 
(coma caused by too much blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the 
body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling blood sugar before, during and 
after surgery. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Rapid 
Do not use Insuman Rapid  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Rapid. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
216 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Rapid). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Rapid  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
217 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Rapid with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How to use Insuman Rapid 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumstances, into a vein 
(blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Insulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires 
experience and special safety precautions. For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar 
setting. 
Do not use Insuman Rapid in insulin pumps – special insulin preparations are available for use in such 
devices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Rapid contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin 
concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other 
medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). 
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. 
Insuman Rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and 
has a water-like consistency. 
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to 
measure the correct dose. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or 
other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with 
insulin human preparations as detailed below. 
Insuman Rapid may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed 
for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues. 
219 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a 
mixture, draw Insuman Rapid into the injection syringe before the other insulin. Inject as soon as you 
have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per 
ml). 
If you use more Insuman Rapid than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Rapid  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your 
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. 
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Rapid  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Rapid without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Rapid and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not know (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Injection site reactions 
220 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported with a frequency not know  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site 
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help  prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
224 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

How to store Insuman Rapid 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Rapid is and what it is used for  
Insuman Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process 
and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. 
Insuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Rapid 
Do not use Insuman Rapid  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Rapid in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen (see 
also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Rapid. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
226 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Rapid). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Rapid  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions orhigh 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
227 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Rapid with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3.  How to use Insuman Rapid 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin. 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use Insuman Rapid in insulin pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such 
devices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. 
How to handle the cartridges  
Insuman Rapid in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen (see 
also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Rapid cartridges are to be used only with the 
following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The 
manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. 
Look at the cartridge before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid 
particles visible, and has a water-like consistency. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither 
alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
-  Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. 
-  Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. 
-  Do not mix Insuman Rapid with any other medicines. 
229 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Problems with the pen?  
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Rapid than you should 
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Rapid  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your 
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. 
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Rapid  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Rapid without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Rapid and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
234 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Rapid is and what it is used for  
Insuman Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process 
and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. It comes in 
cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. 
Insuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Rapid 
Do not use Insuman Rapid  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions

Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Rapid). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Rapid  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),

- 
- 
- 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),

- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Rapid with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast feeding think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your 
babyHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How to use Insuman Rapid 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin. 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses. 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
How to handle SoloStar  
SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Rapid in pre-filled pen is 
only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
another method. 
Read carefully the "SoloStar Instructions for Use" included in this package leaflet. You must use 
the pen as described in these Instructions for Use.  
A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for 
use with SoloStar. 
A safety test must be performed before each injection. 
Look at the cartridge before you use the pen. Do not use Insuman Rapid if you notice particles in it. 
Only use Insuman Rapid if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike. 
Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you 
think you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
Special care before injection  
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
239 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Rapid Solostar pre-filled pen, is not designed to 
allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. 
Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar 
has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Rapid than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Rapid  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your 
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. 
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Rapid  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Rapid without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Rapid and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
240 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site 
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
244 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Rapid"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Insuman Rapid SoloStar solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.  
SoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is 
appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. 
Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or 
follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a 
person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To 
ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the 
dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. 
Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an 
accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too 
little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.  
You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. 
Keep this leaflet for future reference. 
If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or 
contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorization Holder mentioned on the front of this 
leaflet. 
Schematic diagram of the pen 
Important information for use of SoloStar:  
•  Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use 
with SoloStar. 
•  Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. 
•  Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). 
This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. 
• 
• 
If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid 
accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
•  Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. 
•  Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. 
Step 1. Check the insulin  
A.  Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar is 
white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the 
formulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. 
B.  Take off the pen cap. 
C.  Check the appearance of your insulin. 
If you are using clear insulin (Insuman Rapid), do not use this pen if the insulin is cloudy, 
coloured or has particles. 
246 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2. Attach the needle  
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential 
needle blocks. 
Before use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. 
Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. 
A.  Remove the protective seal from a new needle. 
B.  Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending 
on the needle type). 
. 
• 
If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause 
leakage, or break the needle. 
Step 3. Perform a safety test  
Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: 
• 
• 
ensuring that pen and needle work properly 
removing air bubbles 
A. 
Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. 
B. 
  Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the 
inner needle cap and discard it. 
C.  Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. 
D. 
Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. 
247 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
E. 
Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. 
You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. 
• 
• 
• 
If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to 
remove them. 
If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. 
If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use 
this SoloStar. 
Step 4. Select the dose  
You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you 
need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. 
A. 
B. 
• 
• 
Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. 
Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past 
your dose, you can turn back down. 
Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. 
You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the 
dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and 
complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. 
Step 5. Inject the dose  
A. 
B. 
Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insert the needle into the skin. 
248 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C. 
Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window 
will return to “0” as you inject. 
D. 
Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the 
needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. 
The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the 
total of 300 units of insulin has been used. 
Step 6. Remove and discard the needle  
Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. 
This helps prevent: 
• 
• 
Contamination and/or infection 
Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
A. 
• 
B. 
C. 
Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To 
reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. 
If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, 
special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow 
recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of 
infectious diseases. 
Dispose of the needle safely. 
Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. 
Storage instructions  
Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. 
If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to 
room temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 
Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. 
Maintenance  
Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. 
You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. 
Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. 
Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid 
situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, 
use a new one.

How to use Insuman Basal 
Possible side effects 
How to store Insuman Basal 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Basal is and what it is used for.  
Insuman Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process 
and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. The insulin is 
present as tiny crystals of insulin protamine. 
Insuman Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need treatment 
with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control 
the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Basal 
Do not use Insuman Basal  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Basal 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
250 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Basal). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Basal  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),

glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Basal with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Basal in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Basal  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3.  How to use Insuman Basal 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Basal per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Basal. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Basal into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Basal contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin 
concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other 
medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). 
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. 
Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted 
between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and 
cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. 
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other 
substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin 
human preparations as detailed below. 
253 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insuman Basal may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed 
for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues. 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparation. If you need to inject a mixture, 
draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Basal. Inject as soon as you have 
mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml). 
If you use more Insuman Basal than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Basal, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Basal  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin, your 
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. 
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Basal  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Basal without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Basal and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antobodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
5.  How to store Insuman Basal

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
258 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

How to use Insuman Basal 
Possible side effects 
How to store Insuman Basal 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Basal is and what it is used for  
Insuman Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process 
and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. The insulin is 
present as tiny crystals of insulin protamine. 
Insuman Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need treatment 
with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control 
the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Basal 
Do not use Insuman Basal  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Basal. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose.

Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Basal). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Basal  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
-

atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Basal with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Basal in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Basal  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3.  How to use Insuman Basal 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Basal per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Basal. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Basal into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Basal contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin 
concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other 
medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). 
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. 
Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted 
between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and 
cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. 
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other 
substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin 
human preparations as detailed below. 
263 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insuman Basal may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed 
for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues. 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a 
mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Basal. Inject as soon as you 
have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per 
ml). 
If you use more Insuman Basal than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Basal, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Basal  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin, your 
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. 
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Basal  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Basal without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Basal and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
264 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site 
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
5.  How to store Insuman Basal  
Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
andInsuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
269 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

How to store Insuman Basal 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Basal is and what is it used for  
Insuman Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process 
and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. The insulin is 
present as tiny crystals of insulin protamine. 
Insuman Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need treatment 
with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control 
the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Basal 
Do not use Insuman Basal  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Basal in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen (see 
also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Basal. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
271 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Basal). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Basal  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes,

lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Basal with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Basal in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Basal  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to use Insuman Basal 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Basal per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Basal. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Basal into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the cartridges  
Insuman Basal in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Basal cartridges are to be used only with the 
following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The 
manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin 
well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again 
immediately before each injection. 
Mixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at 
least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. 
274 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must 
then be used. 
Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. 
This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a 
problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
-  Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither 
alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.Do not re-fill and re-use 
empty cartridges. 
-  Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. 
-  Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. 
Problems with the pen?  
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Basal than you should 
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Basal, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Basal  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin, your 
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. 
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Basal  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Basal without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Basal and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
275 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
5.  How to store Insuman Basal  
Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
279 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Possible side effects 
How to store Insuman Basal 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Basal is and what it is used for  
Insuman Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process 
and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. The insulin is 
present as tiny crystals of insulin protamine. It comes in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, 
SoloStar. 
Insuman Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need treatment 
with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control 
the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Basal 
Do not use Insuman Basal  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Basal in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Basal. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
281 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Basal). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Basal  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure),

Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Basal with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Basal in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Basal  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to use Insuman Basal 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Basal per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Basal. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Basal into a vein (blood vessel). 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses. 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
How to handle SoloStar  
SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Basal in pre-filled pen is 
only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
another method. 
Read carefully the "SoloStar Instructions for Use" included in this package leaflet. You must use 
the pen as described in these Instructions for Use.  
A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for 
use with SoloStar. 
A safety test must be performed before each injection. 
Mix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again 
immediately before each injection. 
Mixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three 
tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
284 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing 
must then be used. 
Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you 
think you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
Special care before injection  
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Basal SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not designed to 
allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. 
Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar 
has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Basal than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Basal, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Basal  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin, your 
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. 
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Basal  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Basal without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Basal and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
285 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site 
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
5.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
289 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Basal"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Insuman Basal SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.  
SoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is 
appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. 
Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or 
follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a 
person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To 
ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the 
dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. 
Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an 
accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too 
little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.  
You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. 
Keep this leaflet for future reference. 
If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or 
contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorization Holder mentioned on the front of this 
leaflet. 
Schematic diagram of the pen 
Important information for use of SoloStar:  
•  Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use 
with SoloStar. 
Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. 
• 
•  Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). 
This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. 
• 
• 
If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid 
accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
•  Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. 
•  Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. 
Step 1. Check the insulin  
A.  Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar is 
white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the 
formulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. 
B.  Take off the pen cap. 
291 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C.  Check the appearance of your insulin. 
If you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and 
down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the 
cartridge. 
After mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly 
milky-white appearance. 
Step 2. Attach the needle  
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential 
needle blocks. 
Before use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. 
Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. 
A.  Remove the protective seal from a new needle. 
B.  Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending 
on the needle type). 
. 
• 
If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause 
leakage, or break the needle. 
Step 3. Perform a safety test  
Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: 
• 
• 
ensuring that pen and needle work properly 
removing air bubbles 
292 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A. 
Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. 
B. 
Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the 
inner needle cap and discard it. 
C.  Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. 
D. 
E. 
Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. 
Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. 
You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. 
• 
• 
• 
If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to 
remove them. 
If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. 
If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use 
this SoloStar. 
Step 4. Select the dose  
You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you 
need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. 
A. 
B. 
Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. 
Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past 
your dose, you can turn back down. 
293 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. 
You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the 
dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and 
complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. 
Step 5. Inject the dose  
A.  Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
B. 
Insert the needle into the skin. 
C.  Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window 
will return to “0” as you inject. 
D.  Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the 
needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. 
The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the 
total of 300 units of insulin has been used. 
Step 6. Remove and discard the needle  
Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. 
This helps prevent: 
• 
• 
Contamination and/or infection 
Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
A. 
• 
Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To 
reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. 
If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, 
special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow 
recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of 
infectious diseases. 
B.  Dispose of the needle safely. 
C.  Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.

Storage instructions  
Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. 
If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up at 
room temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 
Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. 
Maintenance  
Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. 
You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. 
Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. 
Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid 
situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, 
use a new one.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 15 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 15 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 15 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insuman Comb 15 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 15 
Do not use Insuman Comb 15  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 15. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
296 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 15). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb°15  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
297 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 15 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 15 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 15  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
298 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  How to use Insuman Comb 15 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 15 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 15. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Comb 15 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin 
concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other 
medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). 
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. 
Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted 
between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and 
cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. 
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
299 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or 
other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with 
insulin human preparations as detailed below. 
Insuman Comb 15 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially 
designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin 
analogues. 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a 
mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 15. Inject as soon as 
you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU 
per ml). 
If you use more Insuman Comb 15 than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 15, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 15  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 15 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 15  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 15 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 15 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reporting with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
300 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reporting with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb°15"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb°15"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
304 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb°15"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 15 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 15 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 15 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insuman Comb 15 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 15 
Do not use Insuman Comb 15  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Comb 15 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen 
(see also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 15. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
306 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 15). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 15  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics.

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
307 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
- 
- 
- 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 15 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 15 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 15  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to use Insuman Comb 15 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 15 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 15. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the cartridges  
Insuman Comb 15 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Comb 15 cartridges are to be used only with the 
following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The 
manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin 
well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again 
immediately before each injection. 
Mixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at 
least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. 
309 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must 
then be used. 
Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. 
This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a 
problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither 
alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
- 
- 
- 
Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. 
Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. 
Problems with the pen?  
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Comb 15 than you should 
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 15, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 15  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 15 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 15  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 15 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 15 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
310 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 15"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 15"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
314 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 15"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage.Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 15 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 15 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 15 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. It comes 
in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. 
Insuman Comb 15 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 15 
Do not use Insuman Comb 15  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Comb 15 in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 15. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose.

Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 15). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 15  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
317 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 15 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 15 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 15  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How to use Insuman Comb 15 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 15 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 15. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses. 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
How to handle SoloStar  
SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Comb 15 in pre-filled pen is 
only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
another method. 
Read carefully the "SoloStar Instructions for Use" included in this package leaflet. You must use 
the pen as described in these Instructions for Use.  
A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for 
use with SoloStar. 
A safety test must be performed before each injection. 
Mix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again 
immediately before each injection. 
Mixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three 
tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing 
must then be used. 
319 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you 
think you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
Special care before injection  
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, SoloStar, is 
not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. 
Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar 
has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Comb 15 than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 15, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 15  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 15 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 15  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 15 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 15 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
320 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effectsreported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb°15"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 15"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
324 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb°15"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.  
SoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is 
appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. 
Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or 
follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a 
person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To 
ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the 
dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. 
Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an 
accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too 
little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.  
You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. 
Keep this leaflet for future reference. 
If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or 
contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorization Holder mentioned on the front of this 
leaflet. 
Schematic diagram of the pen 
Important information for use of SoloStar:  
•  Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use 
with SoloStar. 
Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. 
• 
•  Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). 
This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. 
• 
• 
If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid 
accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
•  Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. 
•  Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. 
Step 1. Check the insulin  
A.  Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar is 
white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the 
formulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. 
B.  Take off the pen cap. 
C.  Check the appearance of your insulin. 
If you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and 
down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the 
cartridge. 
326 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly 
milky-white appearance. 
Step 2. Attach the needle  
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential 
needle blocks. 
Before use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. 
Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. 
A.  Remove the protective seal from a new needle. 
B.  Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending 
on the needle type). 
. 
• 
If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause 
leakage, or break the needle. 
Step 3. Perform a safety test  
Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: 
• 
• 
ensuring that pen and needle work properly 
removing air bubbles 
327 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A. 
Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. 
B. 
Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the 
inner needle cap and discard it. 
C.  Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. 
D. 
E. 
Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. 
Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. 
You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. 
• 
• 
• 
If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to 
remove them. 
If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. 
If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use 
this SoloStar. 
Step 4. Select the dose  
You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you 
need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. 
A. 
B. 
Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. 
Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past 
your dose, you can turn back down. 
328 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. 
You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the 
dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and 
complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. 
Step 5. Inject the dose  
A.  Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
329 
 
 
 
 
 
B. 
Insert the needle into the skin. 
C.  Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window 
will return to “0” as you inject. 
D.  Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the 
needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. 
The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the 
total of 300 units of insulin has been used. 
Step 6. Remove and discard the needle  
Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. 
This helps prevent: 
• 
• 
Contamination and/or infection 
Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
A. 
• 
Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To 
reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. 
If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, 
special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow 
recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of 
infectious diseases. 
B.  Dispose of the needle safely. 
C.  Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. 
Storage instructions  
Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. 
If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up at 
room temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 
Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. 
330 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance  
Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. 
You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. 
Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. 
Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid 
situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, 
use a new one.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 25 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insuman Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 25 
Do not use Insuman Comb 25  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 25. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
332 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 25). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 25  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
333 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 25 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 25 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 25  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
334 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  How to use Insuman Comb°25 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 25 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 25. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Comb 25 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin 
concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other 
medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). 
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. 
Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted 
between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and 
cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. 
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other 
substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin 
human preparations as detailed below. 
335 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insuman Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially 
designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin 
analogues. 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a 
mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 25. Inject as soon as 
you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU 
per ml). 
If you use more Insuman Comb 25 than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 25, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 25  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 25  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 25 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 25 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
336 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
340 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 25 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insuman Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 25 
Do not use Insuman Comb 25  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 25. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose.

Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 25). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 25  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
343 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 25 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 25 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 25  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
344 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  How to use Insuman Comb 25 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 25 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 25. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Comb 25 contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin 
concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other 
medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). 
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. 
Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted 
between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and 
cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. 
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other 
substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin 
human preparations as detailed below. 
345 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insuman Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially 
designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin 
analogues. 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a 
mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 25. Inject as soon as 
you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU 
per ml). 
If you use more Insuman Comb 25 than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 25, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 25  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 25  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 25 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 25 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
346 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site 
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
350 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 25 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insuman Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 25 
Do not use Insuman Comb 25  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Comb 25 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen 
(see also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 25. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
352 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 25). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 25  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics.

Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
- 
- 
- 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
- 
- 
- 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 25 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 25 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 25  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to use Insuman Comb 25 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 25 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 25. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the cartridges  
Insuman Comb 25 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Comb 25 cartridges are to be used only with the 
following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units 
-  ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The 
manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin 
well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again 
immediately before each injection. 
Mixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at 
least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. 
355 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must 
then be used. 
Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. 
This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a 
problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither 
alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
- 
- 
- 
Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. 
Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. 
Problems with the pen?  
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Comb 25 than you should 
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 25, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 25  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 25  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 25 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 25 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
356 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
5.  How to store Insuman Comb 25  
Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
360 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 25 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. It comes 
in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. 
Insuman Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 25 
Do not use Insuman Comb 25  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Comb 25 in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 25. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose.

Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 25). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 25  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 25 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 25 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 25  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How to use Insuman Comb 25 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 25 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 25. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses. 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
How to handle SoloStar  
SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Comb 25 in pre-filled pen is 
only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
another method. 
Read carefully the "SoloStar Instructions for Use" included in this package leaflet. You must use 
the pen as described in these Instructions for Use.  
A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for 
use with SoloStar. 
A safety test must be performed before each injection. 
Mix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again 
immediately before each injection. 
Mixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three 
tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing 
must then be used. 
365 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you 
think you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
Special care before injection  
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not 
designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. 
Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar 
has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Comb 25 than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 25, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 25  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 25  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 25 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 25 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
366 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
370 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 25"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.  
SoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is 
appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. 
Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or 
follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a 
person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To 
ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the 
dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. 
Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an 
accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too 
little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.  
You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. 
Keep this leaflet for future reference. 
If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or 
contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorization Holder mentioned on the front of this 
leaflet. 
Schematic diagram of the pen 
Important information for use of SoloStar:  
•  Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use 
with SoloStar. 
Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. 
• 
•  Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). 
This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. 
• 
• 
If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid 
accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
•  Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. 
•  Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. 
Step 1. Check the insulin  
A.  Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar is 
white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the 
formulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. 
B.  Take off the pen cap. 
372 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C.  Check the appearance of your insulin. 
If you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and 
down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the 
cartridge. 
After mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly 
milky-white appearance. 
Step 2. Attach the needle  
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential 
needle blocks. 
Before use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. 
Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. 
A.  Remove the protective seal from a new needle. 
B.  Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending 
on the needle type). 
. 
• 
If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause 
leakage, or break the needle. 
Step 3. Perform a safety test  
Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: 
• 
• 
ensuring that pen and needle work properly 
removing air bubbles 
A. 
Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. 
373 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. 
Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the 
inner needle cap and discard it. 
C.  Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. 
D. 
E. 
Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. 
Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. 
You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. 
• 
• 
• 
If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to 
remove them. 
If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. 
If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use 
this SoloStar. 
Step 4. Select the dose  
You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you 
need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. 
A. 
B. 
• 
• 
Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. 
Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past 
your dose, you can turn back down. 
Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. 
You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the 
dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and 
complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. 
374 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5. Inject the dose  
A.  Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
B. 
Insert the needle into the skin. 
C.  Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window 
will return to “0” as you inject. 
D.  Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the 
needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. 
The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the 
total of 300 units of insulin has been used. 
Step 6. Remove and discard the needle  
Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. 
This helps prevent: 
• 
• 
Contamination and/or infection 
Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
A. 
• 
Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To 
reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. 
If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, 
special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow 
recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of 
infectious diseases. 
B.  Dispose of the needle safely. 
C.  Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. 
Storage instructions  
Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. 
If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to 
room temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 
Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. 
375 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance  
Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. 
You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. 
Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. 
Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid 
situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, 
use a new one.

1.  What Insuman Comb 30 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 30 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 30 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insuman Comb 30 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2. 
What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 30 
Do not use Insuman Comb 30  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 30. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
377 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 30). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 30  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
378 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 30 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 30 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 30  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3.  How to use Insuman Comb 30 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 30 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 30. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Comb 30 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin 
concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other 
medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). 
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. 
Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted 
between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and 
cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. 
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other 
substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin 
human preparations as detailed below. 
380 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insuman Comb 30 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially 
designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin 
analogues. 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a 
mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 30. Inject as soon as 
you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU 
per ml). 
If you use more Insuman Comb 30 than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 30, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 30  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 30 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 30  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 30 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 30 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
381 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 30"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 30"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
385 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 30"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 30 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 30 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 30 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insuman Comb 30 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2. 
What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 30 
Do not use Insuman Comb 30  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Comb 30 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen 
(see also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 30. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
387 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 30). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 30  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
388 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
- 
- 
- 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 30 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 30 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 30

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 30 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 30. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the cartridges  
Insuman Comb 30 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Comb 30 cartridges are to be used only with the 
following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The 
manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin 
well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again 
immediately before each injection. 
Mixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at 
least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must 
then be used. 
390 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. 
This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a 
problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither 
alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
- 
- 
- 
Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. 
Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. 
Problems with the pen?  
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Comb 30 than you should 
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 30, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 30  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 30 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 30  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 30 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 30 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
391 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site 
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 30"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 30"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
395 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as 
hypothyroidism 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 30"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 30 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 30 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 30 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. It comes 
in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. 
Insuman Comb 30 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2. 
What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 30 
Do not use Insuman Comb 30  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Comb 30 in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 30. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose.

Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 30). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 30  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
398 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 30 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 30 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

3. 
How to use Insuman Comb 30 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 30 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 30. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses. 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
How to handle SoloStar  
SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Comb 30 in pre-filled pen is 
only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
another method. 
Read carefully the "SoloStar Instructions for Use" included in this package leaflet. You must use 
the pen as described in these Instructions for Use.  
A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for 
use with SoloStar. 
A safety test must be performed before each injection. 
Mix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again 
immediately before each injection. 
Mixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three 
tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing 
must then be used. 
400 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you 
think you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
Special care before injection  
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not 
designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. 
Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar 
has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Comb 30 than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 30, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 30  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 30 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 30  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 30 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 30 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
401 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 30"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 30"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
406 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 30"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
2. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.  
SoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is 
appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. 
Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or 
follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a 
person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To 
ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the 
dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. 
Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an 
accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too 
little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.  
You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. 
Keep this leaflet for future reference. 
If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or 
contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorization Holder mentioned on the front of this 
leaflet. 
Schematic diagram of the pen 
Important information for use of SoloStar:  
•  Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use 
with SoloStar. 
•  Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. 
•  Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). 
This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. 
• 
• 
If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid 
accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
•  Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. 
•  Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. 
Step 1. Check the insulin  
Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar 
A 
is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the 
formulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. 
B  Take off the pen cap. 
408 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C  Check the appearance of your insulin. 
If you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and 
down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the 
cartridge. 
After mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly 
milky-white appearance. 
Step 2. Attach the needle  
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential 
needle blocks. 
Before use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. 
Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. 
A.  Remove the protective seal from a new needle. 
B.  Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending 
on the needle type). 
. 
• 
If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause 
leakage, or break the needle. 
Step 3. Perform a safety test  
Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: 
• 
• 
ensuring that pen and needle work properly 
removing air bubbles 
A 
Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. 
409 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off 
B 
the inner needle cap and discard it. 
C 
D 
E 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. 
Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. 
Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. 
You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. 
• 
• 
• 
If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to 
remove them. 
If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. 
If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use 
this SoloStar. 
Step 4. Select the dose  
You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you 
need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. 
A 
Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. 
Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past 
B 
your dose, you can turn back down. 
• 
• 
Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. 
You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the 
dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and 
complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. 
410 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5. Inject the dose  
A 
B 
Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insert the needle into the skin. 
Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose 
C 
window will return to “0” as you inject. 
Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the 
D 
needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. 
The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the total 
of 300 units of insulin has been used. 
Step 6. Remove and discard the needle  
Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. 
This helps prevent: 
• 
• 
Contamination and/or infection 
Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To 
A 
reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. 
• 
B 
C 
If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, 
special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow 
recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of 
infectious diseases. 
Dispose of the needle safely. 
Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. 
Storage instructions  
Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. 
If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to 
room temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 
Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. 
411 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance  
Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. 
You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 50 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. 
Insuman Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 50 
Do not use Insuman Comb 50  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 50. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose.

Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 50). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 50  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
414 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 50 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 50 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 50  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3.  How to use Insuman Comb 50 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 50 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 50. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Comb 50 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin 
concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other 
medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). 
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. 
Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted 
between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and 
cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. 
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
416 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or 
other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with 
insulin human preparations as detailed below. 
Insuman Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially 
designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin 
analogues. 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a 
mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 50. Inject as soon as 
you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU 
per ml). 
If you use more Insuman Comb 50 than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 50, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 50  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 50  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 50 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 50 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
417 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
421 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 50 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. 
Insuman Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
1.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 50 
Do not use Insuman Comb 50  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 50. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
423 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 50). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 50  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
424 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 50 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 50 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 50  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3.  How to use Insuman Comb 50 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 50 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 50. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Comb 50 contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin 
concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other 
medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). 
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. 
Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted 
between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and 
cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. 
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or 
other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with 
insulin human preparations as detailed below. 
426 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insuman Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially 
designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin 
analogues. 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a 
mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 50. Inject as soon as 
you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU 
per ml). 
If you use more Insuman Comb 50 than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 50, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 50  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 50  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 50 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 50 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
427 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
431 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 50 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. 
Insuman Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 50 
Do not use Insuman Comb 50  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Comb 50 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen 
(see also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 50. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor 
433 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 50). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 50  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
434 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
- 
- 
- 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 50 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 50 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 50  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to use Insuman Comb 50 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 50 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 50. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for 
use in such devices. 
How to handle the cartridges  
Insuman Comb 50 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Comb 50 cartridges are to be used only with the 
following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units 
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The 
manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin 
well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again 
immediately before each injection. 
Mixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at 
least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. 
436 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must 
then be used. 
Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. 
This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a 
problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection  
Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither 
alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
- 
- 
- 
Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. 
Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. 
Problems with the pen?  
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Comb 50 than you should 
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 50, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 50  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 50  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 50 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 50 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
437 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
5.  How to store Insuman Comb 50

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
441 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Comb 50 is and what it is used for  
Insuman Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. 
It comes in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. 
Insuman Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 50 
Do not use Insuman Comb 50  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Insuman Comb 50 in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). 
Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 50. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose.

Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 50). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Comb 50  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
444 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Comb 50 with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 50 in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 50  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How to use Insuman Comb 50 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Comb 50 per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 50. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Frequency of administration  
Insuman Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Do NOT inject Insuman Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). 
SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple 
doses. 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
How to handle SoloStar  
SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Comb 50 in pre-filled pen is 
only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
another method. 
Read carefully the "SoloStar Instructions for Use" included in this package leaflet. You must use 
the pen as described in these Instructions for Use.  
A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for 
use with SoloStar. 
A safety test must be performed before each injection. 
Mix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again 
immediately before each injection. 
Mixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three 
tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. 
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it 
remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or 
on the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing 
must then be used. 
446 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you 
think you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
Special care before injection  
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not 
designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. 
Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. 
Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar 
has to be used. 
If you use more Insuman Comb 50 than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 50, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Comb 50  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Comb 50  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 50 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Comb 50 and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
447 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Comb 50"). 
-

- 
- 
- 
- 
451 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as 
hypothyroidism    
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Comb 50"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.  
SoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is 
appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. 
Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or 
follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a 
person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To 
ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the 
dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. 
Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an 
accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too 
little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.  
You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. 
Keep this leaflet for future reference. 
If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or 
contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorization Holder mentioned on the front of this 
leaflet. 
Schematic diagram of the pen 
Important information for use of SoloStar:  
•  Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use 
with SoloStar. 
Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. 
• 
•  Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). 
This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. 
• 
• 
If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid 
accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
•  Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. 
•  Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. 
Step 1. Check the insulin  
A.  Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar is 
white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the 
formulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. 
B.  Take off the pen cap. 
C.  Check the appearance of your insulin. 
If you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and 
down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the 
cartridge. 
453 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly 
milky-white appearance. 
Step 2. Attach the needle  
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential 
needle blocks. 
Before use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. 
Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. 
A.  Remove the protective seal from a new needle. 
B.  Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending 
on the needle type). 
. 
• 
If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause 
leakage, or break the needle. 
Step 3. Perform a safety test  
Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: 
• 
• 
ensuring that pen and needle work properly 
removing air bubbles 
A. 
Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. 
454 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. 
Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the 
inner needle cap and discard it. 
C.  Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. 
D. 
E. 
Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. 
Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. 
You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. 
• 
• 
• 
If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to 
remove them. 
If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. 
If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use 
this SoloStar. 
Step 4. Select the dose  
You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you 
need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. 
A. 
B. 
• 
• 
Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. 
Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past 
your dose, you can turn back down. 
Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. 
You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the 
dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and 
complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. 
455 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5. Inject the dose  
A.  Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
B. 
Insert the needle into the skin. 
C.  Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window 
will return to “0” as you inject. 
D.  Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the 
needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. 
The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the 
total of 300 units of insulin has been used. 
Step 6. Remove and discard the needle  
Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. 
This helps prevent: 
• 
• 
Contamination and/or infection 
Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
A. 
• 
Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To 
reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. 
If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, 
special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow 
recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of 
infectious diseases. 
B.  Dispose of the needle safely. 
C.  Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. 
Storage instructions  
Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. 
If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to 
room temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 
Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. 
456 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance  
Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. 
You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. 
Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. 
Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid 
situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, 
use a new one.

How to store Insuman Infusat 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Infusat is and what it is used for  
Insuman Infusat contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process 
and is identical with the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Infusat is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and short duration of action. 
Insuman Infusat must only be used in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. 
Insuman Infusat is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need 
treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin 
to control the level of blood sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Infusat 
Do not use Insuman Infusat  
If you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Infusat. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity 
(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Infusat). Contact your doctor if 
458 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may 
tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic  
medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., 
- 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- 
whom to contact in the event of technical problems with your pump, 
- 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require 
insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Insuman Infusat  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
459 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Insuman Infusat with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Infusat in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Insuman Infusat contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
460 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to use Insuman Infusat 
Dose  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
determine how much Insuman Infusat per day you will need, how much of this is infused 
continuously ("basal rate") and how much and when you need additional insulin as an "insulin 
boost" ("bolus dose"), 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to use a higher or lower dose of Insuman Infusat, 
- 
- 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able 
to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too 
low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Infusat is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. 
Your doctor will show you how and in which area of the skin you should infuse your insulin and how 
often you must change the puncture site within the particular area of skin where you are infusing the 
insulin. Speak to your doctor before you change the area of skin that you are infusing. 
Do not use Insuman Infusat in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Situations in which you must not 
start or continue to use insulin pumps are described in the operating manuals for these pumps. 
How to handle the vials  
Insuman Infusat must only be used in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. Only tetrafluoroethylene 
or polyethylene catheters must be used for infusion. The operating manual provided with the pump 
will tell you how to use it. 
Insuman Infusat must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, 
and has a water-like consistency. 
Special care before injection  
Before starting the infusion remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other 
disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. 
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Infusat must NOT be mixed with any other 
insulin preparations. 
Insulin pump faults  
You should always consider the possibility of a technical problem if, in order to achieve the desired 
blood sugar levels, 
- 
- 
you need additional insulin ("bolus doses") at larger doses or more often than usual, or 
you need additional insulin ("bolus doses") at smaller doses or less often than usual. 
For details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps see the operating manual. 
If the pump does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection 
syringe. Therefore, keep injection syringes and injection needles as well. However, use only those 
461 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per 
ml. 
If you use more Insuman Infusat than you should  
- 
If you have injected too much Insuman Infusat, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Insuman Infusat  
- 
If you have missed a dose of Insuman Infusat or if you have not injected enough insulin, 
your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar 
frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Insuman Infusat  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Infusat without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups  
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman 
Infusat and other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•  Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)  
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
•  The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
•  Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions 
to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  Oedema 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Side effects reported uncommonly  
Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) 
• 
462 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
•  Sodium retention 
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  Skin changes at the injection site  
If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused 
by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent 
these skin changes. 
•  Skin and allergic reactions 
Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on 
injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also 
spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. 
• 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Insulin antibodies 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
your insulin pump does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Infusat"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Insuman Infusat"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
466 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Infusat"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Stop your insulin infusion (if necessary, by withdrawing the needle) at least until you feel that 
you are fully alert again. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes 
or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial 
sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insuman Implantable is and what it is used for  
Insuman Implantable contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology 
process and is identical to the body's own insulin. 
Insuman Implantable is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. When used 
with an implantable insulin pump, Insuman Implantable will be continuously infused in your body and 
thus, may replace a long-acting insulin. 
Insuman Implantable (400 IU/ml) contains 4 times as much insulin in 1 ml as standard insulin 
(100 IU/ml). This means that Insuman Implantable is more concentrated than standard insulin. 
Insuman Implantable is used to reduce high blood sugar in adult patients with a certain form of 
diabetes (type 1 diabetes mellitus). These patients are not adequately controlled despite intensive 
injection of insulin under their skin (multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy). 
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of 
blood sugar. 
Insuman Implantable must only be used in the Medtronic MiniMed pump which is implanted under the 
skin of your belly and infuses your insulin continuously. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insuman Implantable 
Do not use Insuman Implantable  
- 
if you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). 
via other routes of administration (e.g. injection). 
- 
468 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump  
- 
if you are allergic to titanium alloy, polysulfone or silicone materials used in the implanted 
components of the pump. 
with other insulin medicine other than Insuman Implantable. 
in adolescents who have not reached adult size. 
if you live permanently at heights above 2439 meters (8000 feet).

Warnings and precautions  
If you are ill or have mental problems that make you unable to make changes to your pump based on 
your blood glucose level or to take the appropriate actions if you have a problem with your pump, talk 
to your doctor. 
Before you can use the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump, you will be trained. This training will 
be about this implantable insulin pump, how to use the pump and how to deal with special situations, 
such as hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. In addition, you should read and follow the instructions 
given in the patient manual accompanying the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. 
Do not use Insuman Implantable with any other syringes or pumps (external or implantable) than the 
implantable pump supplied by Medtronic MiniMed. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and/or urine tests), diet and physical 
activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If you expect to have frequent medical imaging (e.g. MRI or ultrasound), talk to your doctor. 
If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may occur if you administer too much insulin. 
If you experience severe low blood sugar levels, this may indicate a problem with your pump. If this 
happens, immediately contact your doctor who is trained to perform pump investigations. 
You must closely monitor your blood sugar level on refill days. During a refill procedure, a very small 
amount of Insuman Implantable may be deposited subcutaneously, which might result in low blood 
sugar levels. 
Hyperglycaemia 
It is possible that the insulin can cause blockage of the implantable pump. You must check your blood 
sugar level at least four times daily to detect and prevent high blood sugar levels due to the pump not 
working properly. If you get severe hyperglycemia (very high blood sugar) or ketoacidosis (build up 
of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) or coma, this may indicate 
a problem with the pump. If you notice a rapid increase in blood sugar level which does not respond to 
a bolus dose of insulin, contact your doctor immediately. She/he is trained to perform pump 
investigations. In case the pump does not work properly you must always have access to injection 
devices (e.g. syringe or pen) and insulin suitable for subcutaneous injection. To prevent such pump 
problems, your doctor will schedule appointments at least every 6-months to rinse your pump. 
In case your pump is damaged or your Personal Pump Communicator (PPC) is damaged or lost, review 
with your doctor what you should do in case your pump does not work correctly. 
Site of the pump implantation 
Infection of the pump pocket (where your pump is placed), erosion of the skin where your pump is 
implanted and poor healing of the incision site in your skin can occur. If you notice pain, redness, 
swelling in the area of your pump, contact your doctor. 
Liver reaction 
Insulin administration via the pump can cause a fat infiltration of the liver at single, well-defined 
locations (called focal hepatic steatosis). This happens when the tip of your catheter is fixed or in very 
469 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
close proximity to your liver. This seems to be reversible when your catheter is repositioned or your 
insulin infusion stopped and without consequences on your health (see section 4). 
Antibodies to insulin 
Insulin treatment by continuous infusion in the body is likely to cause your body to produce antibodies 
to insulin (substances that act against insulin). This may require a change to your insulin dose (see 
section 4). 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a 
lower dose. 
Travel 
Talk to your doctor to find out what you should do if you plan: 
to live at a height above 2439 meters (8000 feet) 
- 
to travel to a height above 2439 meters (8000 feet) other than commercial aircraft 
- 
to dive below 7.6 meters (25 feet). 
- 
Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about: 
- 
the availability of your insulin and the hospital which will be able to replace the Insuman 
Implantable in the country you are visiting, 
whom to contact in the event of technical problems with your pump, 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
the possible problems of changing to different time zones, 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
what you should do in emergency situations if you feel unwell or become ill. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require extra care (e.g. urine and 
blood tests): 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need to see a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor quickly. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
Because you have type 1 diabetes, an insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, do not stop your insulin. If 
you stop using your insulin this could lead to a very high blood sugar level. 
You must also make sure you get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or 
treating you that you require insulin. 
Children and adolescents  
There is no experience with Insuman Implantable in children and adolescents below 18 years. Due to 
the size of the pump, adolescents who have not reached the adult size must not be implanted. 
Other medicines and Insuman Implantable  
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). You may need to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low 
or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if 
any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
- 
470 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). These medicines are used 
for mental problems that affect how you think, feel or act. 
- 
- 
- 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: 
- 
- 
- 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or stop the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines, ask your doctor or nurse. 
Insuman Implantable with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. There is no clinical information with the use of 
Insuman Implantable in an implantable pump in pregnant women. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines  
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
471 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Keep this in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a 
car or using machines). 
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Implantable  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to use Insuman Implantable  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor or 
nurse if you are not sure. 
Insuman Implantable will be prescribed by a doctor who has received training in the use of the 
Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. 
Dose  
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will 
- 
- 
determine how much Insuman Implantable per day you will need, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests. 
Many things may affect your blood sugar level. You should know what these are so that you can react 
correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See 
the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
The insulin in your pump must be replaced every 40 to 45 days with new insulin. Do not extend this 
period of time. Contact your doctor immediately if you are unable to go to the hospital or clinicto 
replace the insulin in your pump. Based on your needs, you may need to replace your insulin earlier. 
The pump is not connected to a glucose meter. You should practice good diabetes care and test your 
own blood sugar levels at least four times daily to check your blood sugar levels and determine insulin 
doses. 
Part of the daily insulin dose is infused continuously by the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump 
and the remaining part of the daily dose is administered by you, using the same pump, as a bolus 
before meals. The amount of insulin is constantly monitored through the PPC which communicates 
with the pump via radio waves. 
Method of administration  
Insuman Implantable must only be used in the Medtronic MiniMed implantable pump. 
Insuman Implantable must not be used with any other type of injection devices (e.g. syringes). 
The Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump, which is implanted under the skin of your belly, infuses 
your insulin continuously (continuous intraperitoneal infusion). You will be admitted to the hospital to 
have the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump surgically implanted in your belly. The pump system 
will also be programmed and tested prior to your leaving the hospital. 
All pump procedures (such as pump refill, rinsing of the pump, pump investigations to check whether 
your pump works properly) are performed using sterile technique to avoid risk of infection. Infections 
around the pump implantation site may require the removal of your pump (explantation of the pump). 
Pump refill 
How to handle the vials 
Your doctor will be handling the insulin vials and has the accessories (e.g. refill syringes and needles) 
and equipment required to fill your implantable pump. 
472 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Refilling the pump is a sterile procedure which must be carried out in the hospital or clinic. The 
unused insulin in the pump will be removed and the pump refilled with fresh insulin. 
The insulin in your pump must be replaced every 40 to 45 days with new insulin or earlier based on 
your insulin needs. Alarms in your PPC will let you know if your reservoir level is getting low. Do not 
extend this period of time (45 days) and contact your doctor immediately if you are unable to go to the 
hospital or clinic to replace the insulin in your pump. 
You must closely monitor your blood sugar level on refill days. During this procedure, a very small 
amount of Insuman Implantable may be deposited under your skin, which may result in low blood 
sugar levels. 
Pump blockage 
Insulin deposits can cause blockage of the pump. If you need to increase your insulin to maintain your 
blood sugar level, if you experience refractory hyperglycaemia, this may indicate a problem with the 
pump. You must contact your doctor immediately. She/he is trained to perform pump procedures 
which are needed tomake sure your pump works properly. To prevent pump problems, your doctor 
will schedule appointments at least every 6-months to rinse your pump. 
If you use more Insuman Implantable than you should  
Your doctor will program maximum dose limits into your PPC. 
If you try to deliver more than 2.5 times the bolus maximum in one hour, the alarm “hourly max 
exceeded” will be displayed on your PPC screen. If you need to deliver one additional bolus, press 
“SEL” and then “ACT”. You may exceed this limit by programming only one bolus within 
10 minutes. If you try to deliver a second bolus, you will receive the hourly max exceeded alarm on 
your PPC screen again. 
If you forget the dose before a meal: 
If you forget to use Insuman Implantable  
• 
You may feel symptoms of high blood sugar after you eat. If this occurs, you should contact your 
doctor immediately. Your doctor will tell you how to manage your blood glucose levels. 
If you forget to have your pump refilled: 
• 
The insulin in your pump must be replaced every 40 to 45 days with new insulin. Do not extend this 
period of time (45 days) and contact your doctor immediately if you are unable to go to the hospital or 
clinic to replace the insulin in your pump. 
Based on your needs, you may need to replace your insulin earlier. The PPC prompts you with 
messages on the screen. If your pump has run out of insulin or is delivering less insulin than you need, 
you may feel symptoms of high blood sugar. If this happens, contact your doctor immediately. Your 
doctor will tell you how to manage your blood glucose levels. 
If you stop using Insuman Implantable  
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Implantable 
without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
► 
Side effects reported with the insulin  
Most serious side effects 
Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
• 
The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side 
effects of low blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
Hyperglycaemia: If your blood sugar is too high, you may experience hyperglycaemia. 
473 
• 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hyperglycaemia can become serious and lead to a serious condition (ketoacidosis). For further 
information on side effects of high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) 
• 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
• 
Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to 
insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), 
severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood 
pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. 
Other side effects 
Side effects reported commonly  
• 
Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and 
ankles. 
Oedema 
Sodium retention 
Side effects reported with a frequency not known  
• 
Insulin may also cause sodium retention, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by 
intensified insulin therapy 
• 
Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic 
attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
• 
Insulin administration via the intraperitoneal route can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin 
(substances that act against insulin). Elevated levels of antibodies to insulin are not commonly 
associated with a need to change your insulin dose or occurrence of serious side effects. 
• 
Insulin administration via the pump can cause a fat infiltration of the liver at single, well-defined locations 
(called focal hepatic steatosis). This happens when the tip of your catheter is fixed or in very close 
proximity to your liver.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA  
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not administered your insulin or not administered enough, e.g. due to pump not working 
properly or catheter blockage. 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you 
have an injury, are having an operation, have an infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and Insuman 
Implantable"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia  
Thirst, increased need to urinate (pee), tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach ache, fast and deep breathing, 
sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from 
lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. 
Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)  
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a 
heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when 
your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you administer too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances 
similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Insuman Implantable"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:  
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
478 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
In your body 
- 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, 
clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These 
symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
In your brain 
- 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling 
sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, 
convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker or 
may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and Insuman 
Implantable"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
If this happens, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can 
help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident 
about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others 
would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not administer insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Beware: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such 
as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). 
Your doctor or nurse should have talked to you about this before. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if itcomes back. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain 
that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Final Study Report for Protocol 0624-200 was submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No 1901/2006. 
Title of the study: 
“An open-label, multiple-dose study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 
subcutaneous versus intravenous administration of CINRYZE in adolescents and adults with hereditary 
angioedema (Protocol 0624-2400)”. 
II. 
RECOMMENDATION 
No regulatory changes are anticipated in Europe. 
III. 
REGULATORY BACKGROUND: 
Cinryze® [C1 esterase inhibitor (human)] is a highly purified, viral-inactivated, nanofiltered 
concentrate of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 INH) produced from human plasma. C1 INH is a normal 
constituent of human blood and primarily regulates activation of the contact and complement 
pathways; C1 INH also regulates the fibrinolytic system. 
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant disease resulting from mutations of the C1 
INH gene on chromosome 11 resulting in deficient and/or dysfunctional plasma C1 INH protein. The 
diagnosis of a C1 INH deficiency is suggested by a history that includes recurrent attacks of 
angioedema, characterized by swelling of the skin or mucosa. Serum C4, C1 INH antigen, and 
functional C1 INH levels can be measured to assist with the diagnosis of HAE. 
CINRYZE intravenous (IV) formulation can be administered as replacement therapy of the deficient or 
dysfunctional C1 INH. CINRYZE was approved in the US for routine prophylaxis against angioedema 
attacks in adolescent and adult patients with HAE in 2008. CINRYZE was approved throughout the 
European Union (EU), via the Centralized Procedure, in 2011 for treatment and pre-procedure 
prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with HAE, and routine prevention of 
angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with severe and recurrent attacks of HAE who are 
intolerant to or insufficiently protected by oral prevention treatments, or patients who are inadequately 
managed with repeated acute treatment. The approved dosing regimen of CINRYZE for routine 
prophylaxis against angioedema attacks is 1000 U administered IV every 3 or 4 days. 
CINRYZE continues to be developed further for the treatment and prevention of angioedema attacks in 
patients with HAE (via IV and subcutaneous [SC] administration) and for use in clinical management of 
other disease states that may benefit from C1 INH administration. 
The necessity to gain venous access for each IV administration can limit the use of CINRYZE by 
patients. Some HAE patients have inaccessible peripheral veins due to thrombophlebitis; others have 
veins of inadequate size or SC location. Moreover, because HAE patients are often subjected to chronic 
steroid use, many have an increased body mass index (BMI) which makes locating an accessible 
peripheral vein difficult. As a result, HAE patients often require placement of indwelling central venous 
catheters, which can be associated with complications. In addition, some patients with HAE may be 
reluctant or unable to administer CINRYZE via the IV route. Subcutaneous administration of CINRYZE 
represents an alternative method of administering prophylaxis that may fulfill an unmet medical need 
for HAE patients in whom accessing peripheral veins is difficult or central venous catheters are

contraindicated, and may alleviate potential complications associated with IV administration via 
indwelling catheters. 
Protocol 0624-200 was developed to evaluate the SC route of administration, by comparing the 
pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of CINRYZE following SC and IV administration in subjects 
with HAE. The doses of CINRYZE evaluated in this study were 1000 U administered IV (consistent with 
approved IV dosing regimen for HAE prophylaxis) and 1000 U or 2000 U administered by SC injection. 
Selection of doses for SC administration was based on results of the single-dose pilot healthy volunteer 
study (Protocol 0624-100) and volume considerations. 
IV. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Study Design: 
This open-label, multiple-dose study was conducted to evaluate the safety/tolerability and PK/PD of SC 
versus IV administration of CINRYZE in adolescent and adult subjects with HAE. The study was 
conducted at 6 centers in the US. Following a screening visit within 21 days prior to study entry, 
subjects with HAE who met all other specified entry criteria were randomly assigned to one of two 
treatment sequences: 
•  CINRYZE 1000 U IV→1000 U via SC injection (Sequence A/B) 
•  CINRYZE 1000 U IV→2000 U via SC injection (Sequence A/C) 
Each subject was to participate in two 18-day treatment periods, which were separated by a washout 
period of at least 14 days (starting after Day 18 of Period 1) during which no C1 INH therapy or other 
blood products were administered. Study drug was administered twice weekly for 2 weeks (i.e., on 
Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) in each treatment period.In Period 1, all subjects were to receive 1000 U 
CINRYZE as an IV infusion of 10 mL over ~10 minutes (Treatment A); in Period 2, SC CINRYZE was to 
be administered at separate sites in the abdomen as either 2 x 1.5 mL injections (3 mL total; 1000 U, 
Treatment B) or 4 x 1.5 mL injections (6 mL total; 2000 U, Treatment C). 
Subjects remained outpatient throughout the study. Eligible subjects reported to the study center on 
Day 1 of each treatment period (the day of the first CINRYZE dose in each period) and were to remain 
in the study unit until after collection of the 8 hour PK sample. Subjects were to return to the study 
unit on Days 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11 (additional 8- hour PK profile), 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18 of each treatment 
period for PK/PD and safety assessments. PK/PD evaluations included assessment of antigenic and 
functional C1 INH levels (PK) and C4 complement (PD) levels. Safety was monitored through the 
recording of adverse events (AEs) and changes in physical examinations, 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG, performed if clinically indicated), vital signs, and clinical laboratory testing (complete blood 
count [CBC], blood urea nitrogen [BUN], and creatinine); blood samples were also analyzed for the 
presence of C1 INH antibodies (Days 1[pre-dose] and 18 of each treatment period). 
Study personnel were to report any HAE attacks that occurred during the study as AEs, including those 
occurring during the washout period. General supportive care for management of acute HAE attacks 
(e.g., airway protection, IV fluids) was to follow standard practices at the investigational site or other 
site of care. If specific treatment with C1 INH was indicated (as determined by the investigator) the 
recommended treatment for use during the study was open-label CINRYZE 1000 U IV, followed by a 
second dose of 1000 U IV 1 hour later if needed. 
If a subject had an HAE attack during Days 1-18 of one of the treatment periods, study treatment and 
study procedures were interrupted during that period. After recovery from the HAE attack, it was

possible for the subject to re-enter the study after at least a 14-day washout period in which no C1 
INH therapy or other blood products were  administered, if mutually agreed by both the Sponsor and 
investigator. Otherwise, the subject was discontinued from the study. If the subject had another HAE 
attack during either treatment period, the subject was discontinued from the study. 
Study Period: 
Initiation Date: 07 June 2010 (first subject dosed) 
Completion Date:  16 December 2010 (last subject contact) 
Main Criteria for Inclusion: 
To qualify for enrollment, a subject had to: 
•  Be at least 12 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of HAE and a history of at least one of 
the following: 
o  C1 INH gene mutation 
o  C4, C1 INH antigen, or functional C1 INH level below normal 
•  During the 3 consecutive months prior to screening, have a history of less than 1.0 HAE attack 
per month (average) treated with C1 INH therapy or any other blood products, ecallantide 
(Kalbitor®), icatibant (Firazyr®), antifibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid), IV fluids, or narcotic 
analgesics. 
•  Have not received C1 INH therapy or any blood products (for treatment or prevention of an 
HAE attack) or ecallantide (Kalbitor®), icatibant (Firazyr®), or antifibrinolytics (e.g. 
tranexamic acid) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug in Period 1. 
•  Have had no change in androgen therapy (e.g. danazol, oxandrolone, stanozolol, testosterone) 
within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug in Period 1. 
• 
If female, agree not to start taking or change the dose of any hormonal contraceptive regimen 
or hormone replacement therapy (i.e. estrogen/progestin containing products) within 3 months 
prior to the first dose of study drug in Period 1. 
•  Have not received an immunization within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug in 
Period 1. 
Subjects: 
Twenty-four (24) subjects were planned for enrollment. Twenty-six (26) subjects were randomized and 
treated with CINRYZE (any amount) and analyzed for safety: 26, 13, and 12 subjects received 1000 U 
IV, 1000 U SC, and 2000 U SC, respectively, and were included in the safety population. Twenty-five 
(25) subjects completed treatment (1 subject did not receive treatment with 1000 U SC in Period 2) 
and 24 subjects completed the study. Subjects with evaluable PK/PD profiles were included in the 
PK/PD analyses. 
Two subjects had an HAE attack during Period 1 (IV) which resulted in an interruption of study drug 
and/or study procedures; per protocol, these subjects re-entered the study (Period 1) after the 
appropriate washout interval (2000408 and 2000702, Sequence A/B).

• Treatment C - 4 x 1.5 mL SC injections (2000 U in 6 mL total; 4 separate abdominal injection sites). 
Periods 1 and 2 were separated by a washout period of at least 14 days (with no C1 INH or other blood 
products). 
Batches: 
10A08L370A, 10A16L370A, 10B01L370A, 10D02L370A, 10D23L370A, 10E11L370A, 10E28L370A, 
10F10L370A, and 10G09L370A 
Methods of Evaluation: 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics parameters were calculated using observed or baseline-
corrected concentrations versus actual time relative to Dose 1 of the treatment period and 
noncompartmental analyses in WinNonlin 5.3 (Pharsight, Cary, NC). 
Efficacy: n/a 
Safety was monitored by recording AEs and changes in physical examinations, 12-lead ECG (performed 
if clinically indicated), vital signs, and clinical laboratory testing. 
Statistics 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics – Plasma concentration data and PK/PD parameters were 
summarized using descriptive statistics and nominal times including number of observations (N), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum (min), median, maximum (max), coefficient of variation 
(CV%), and geometric mean (PK/PD parameters only). Linear correlation coefficients were estimated 
for plots of Cmax, Rmax, Cavg, AUC0-72, and AUC0-τ, values versus dose normalized to body weight (U/kg) 
values. Results of C1 INH antibody testing were reported for individual subjects, as appropriate. 
Safety – Descriptive statistics (e.g., N, mean, standard error [SE], SD, median, range) were reported 
for baseline, post-baseline, and change from baseline values in clinical laboratory and vital signs 
parameters. Four summaries of AEs were presented by treatment period: all AEs, all AEs related to 
study drug, all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), and all TEAEs related to study drug. Adverse events 
were coded using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) Version 14.0.

The level of plasma C1 INH that effectively prevents HAE attacks varies between patients. Within-
patient factors may also influence disease severity and response to therapy, and disease severity can 
fluctuate over time. Consequently, a simple PK association between plasma C1 INH concentrations and 
efficacy in this complex and dynamic condition has not been established. As a result, response to 
therapy continues to be reliant on clinical measures and based on the results of the randomized and 
open-label prevention studies with CINRYZE, employing the recommended IV dose of 1000 U every 3 
or 4 days is an effective regimen. 
Pharmacodynamic Results: 
The results from this repeat-dose PK/PD study in HAE patients suggest that, despite the high degree of 
inter-subject variability, exposure to C1 INH antigen and functional C1 INH activity, as measured by 
mean (± SD) steady-state baseline-corrected Cavg and AUC0-τ, achieved following SC administration of 
2000 U was similar to that following IV administration of 1000 U. In addition, the PD response at 
steady-state, i.e., the Rmax and AUC0-τ for C4 complement following SC administration of 2000 U was 
similar to that following IV administration of 1000 U. The IV results are presented in the table below.

Data were available from 4 subjects less than 18 years of age and 21 subjects > 18 years of age. 
Considering the small sample size and inherent inter-subject variability, mean change from baseline 
levels and derived PK/PD parameters were generally similar in both groups. Similarly, there were no 
obvious differences in complement levels or PK/PD parameters due to gender or body weight. 
Safety Results: 
No deaths or other serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred during the study. One subject (2000702) 
had study drug discontinued due to an AE (HAE attack, onset Day 16 of Period 1 re-entry [1000 U IV]). 
One additional subject (2000202) was prematurely discontinued from the study due to an AE (HAE

attack) which occurred 3 days after completing treatment with 1000 U SC in Period 2. No subjects 
experienced a TEAE that was thrombotic or thromboembolic in nature during the study. 
Across all subjects, 85% (22/26) reported 1 or more TEAEs during the study: 46% (12/26) of subjects 
receiving 1000 U IV, 77% (10/13) of subjects receiving 1000 U SC, and 92% (11/12) of subjects 
receiving 2000 U SC. During the IV period, the only TEAE reported in more than 1 subject was 
angioedema attack due to HAE (19%, 5/26). 
Overall, subjects ≥18 years of age reported more TEAEs compared to subjects <18 years of age.  Both 
cohorts reported injection site reactions, with pain followed by erythema being most prominent in 
frequency.  There were no other notable differences. 
Results of clinical laboratory evaluations and vital signs measurements were generally unremarkable 
and did not suggest any treatment-emergent abnormalities related to the administration of CINRYZE. 
Immunogenicity: For each treatment period, plasma samples collected on Day 1 (pre-dose) and on 
Day 18 (168 h post Dose 4) were analyzed for C1 INH antibodies. One subject (Subject 2000203) was 
not tested at pre-dose of Treatment Period 1 due to insufficient plasma sample volume. In addition to 
the scheduled testing, Subject 2000402 was inadvertently tested at 8 h post-Dose 1 of Period 1. No 
subjects had detectable C1 INH antibodies. 
Conclusions: 
•  CINRYZE administered via the SC route at doses of 1000 U and 2000 U was associated with 
generally mild to moderate injection site reactions, most notably pain, which was commonly 
characterized as burning or stinging. No subjects were discontinued from study drug due to an 
injection site reaction. 
• 
There were no clinically significant safety signals due to CINRYZE on laboratory parameters or 
vital signs. 
•  No subjects had detectable C1 INH antibodies in plasma samples collected on Day 1(pre-dose) 
and on Day 18 (168 h post Dose 4) of each treatment period. 
•  Mean change from baseline levels of C1 INH antigen, functional C1 INH activity and C4 
complement, and the derived PK/PD parameters were generally similar in 4 subjects <18 years 
of age compared with 21 subjects >18 years of age. There were no obvious differences in 
complement levels or PK/PD parameters due to gender or body weight.

MAHs response (Summary) 
Within eCTD sequences 046 and 048 the MAH submitted supplemental data regarding the adolescent 
sub-population of the study. Demographic characteristics and applied treatment schedules were 
amended. Furthermore, comparative pharmacokinetic parameters for the antigen and functional C1 
INH activity have been provided. Safety analysis with a focus on the adolescent subgroup has been 
compiled which covers frequency of angioedema attacks. 
Tables on demographic details, frequency of HAE attacks, and comparative safety-analyses are 
included in the response document, and references to the CSR have been provided. 
Occurrence of angioedema attacks with regard to the adolescent subject group has been further 
elucidated:  
The proportion of subjects who experienced an angioedema attack during the IV treatment period was 
similar for subjects <18 years of age (1/4, 25%) and subjects ≥18 years of age (4/22, 18%). 
However, all but 1 of these subjects (a 48-year-old female) experienced the attack(s) 4-7 days after 
dosing with IV CINRYZE was completed. Individual reports of concerned subjects have been provided. 
One of 4 subjects <18 years of age (25%) and 1/21 subjects ≥18 years of age (5%) experienced an 
angioedema attack during the SC treatment period. Individual reports of the concerned subjects have 
been provided. 
Assessment of MAHs response 
Requested details regarding the adolescent subgroup from study 0624-200 have been submitted within 
the response document. Details, analyses, and tables cover the identified gaps as identified in the 
assessment report. Furthermore, the results do not point to specific efficacy or safety issues within this 
sub-population. Comparative PK-data show slightly decreased AUC and cmax and increased tmax and t1/2. 
Clearance might be interpreted as slightly increased in the adolescent population. However, these 
differences are considered to be marginal and not representative with respect to the low subject 
numbers. Description of the episodes of HAE attacks has been provided. As those episodes represent 
an anticipated pattern and mainly evolved 5 - 7 days after treatment and as frequency and character 
of the attacks in adolescents did not differ from the adults, no signal has been detected at that point. 
Conclusion 
The submitted supplemental comparative analysis regarding 4 out of 26 subjects is considered to cover 
the raised open issue, adequately.

The submitted clinical expert report according to article 46 mainly reflects PK/PD and safety results 
over all available subjects. It is acknowledged that low number of included subjects, overall (26), and 
the even lower number of adolescent subjects (4) does not allow valid comparative analysis. 
Comparative presentation and characterization of the adolescent subgroup have been addressed, 
adequately. 
Based on the respective data, no regulatory action with respect to the currently valid SmPC is 
recommended. 
Recommendation 
  PAC fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required

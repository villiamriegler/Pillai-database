SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1.1 
Introduction 
During  the  initial  assessment  of  Gardasil  the  MAH  committed  to  provide  an  efficacy  analysis  with 
respect  to  cross-protection  against  related  non-vaccine  HPV  type  disease  and  persistent  infection 
(FUM 025). Protocols 012 and 013/015 (FUTURE studies) submitted in the Marketing Authorisation 
Application  (MAA)  were  planned  to  fulfil  this  commitment.  Based  on  the  data  on  outcome  of  the 
cross-protection  analysis,  the  MAH  submitted  this  variation  to  extend  the  indication  to  include 
protection  against  HPV  31-,  33-  52-  and  58-related  low-  and  high-grade  cervical  dysplasia  and 
cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and to revise sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC. 
Following CHMP request the MAH agreed to withdraw the request for an extension of indication to 
limit  this  application  to  the  update  of  section  5.1  and  this  type  II  variation  is  thereby  considered 
approvable. 
1.2 
Clinical aspects 
The Papillomavirus family has been organised into genus and species groupings based on the major 
capsid  protein,  L1,  sequence  homologies  (see  figure  1).  The  L1  protein  gene is the most conserved 
gene  within  the  viral  genome.  Members  of  a  papillomavirus  genus  share  at  least  60%  L1  gene 
sequence homology. HPV species members share 70 to 75% L1 gene sequence homology on average, 
as well as a common pathophysiology. Individual types within a given HPV species may have up to 
90% homology.

Forty  (40)  HPV  types  infect  the  genital  tract.  All  of  the  known  genital  HPV  types  are  members  of 
Genus Alpha-papillomavirus. The 18 HPV types that have been classified as being oncogenic based 
on epidemiologic and/or phylogenetic evidence (HPV 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 
58, 59, 66, 68, 73, and 82) are members of 5 species within the Alpha-papillomavirus genus (see table 
1). HPV 16 is the prototype of the A9 species, and HPV 18 is the prototype of the A7 species.

HPV 16 and or HPV 18 cause most of HPV-related cancer cases (~70%). Non-vaccine members of 
the  A9  and  A7  species  are  responsible  for  up  to  20%  of  all  cervical  cancers,  and  an  even  larger 
proportion  of  CIN  lesions.  The  remaining  3  oncogenic  HPV  species  (A5  [prototype  HPV  51],  A6 
[prototype  HPV  56]  and  A11 [prototype HPV 73]) include HPV types that rarely cause cancer, but 
commonly cause CIN. Table 2 summarises HPV types detected in cervical cancers.

For  calculations  of  HPV  type  contribution  in  the  context  of  infection  with  2  or  more  HPV  types,  a 
hierarchy based on the known pathogenicity of HPV types was used (HPV 16>18>31/45>52/58>33>all 
others). 
Given  the  homologies  between  HPV  species  members  and  the  polyclonal  nature  of  the  immune 
responses  generated  by  HPV  vaccine  it  is  biologically  plausible  that  anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 
generated by Gardasil may be able to neutralize virions for HPV types related to HPV 16 and/or HPV 
18,  thereby  preventing  infection  and/or  disease  caused  by  these  types,  i.e.  cross-protection.  The 
highest degree of homologies in amino acid sequences are between HPV 18 and 45 (88%) followed 
by HPV 16 and 31 (83%) and HPV 16 and 33 (81%). 
In  the  MAA,  data  were  provided  on  cross-reactivity  of  Month  7  sera  with  non-vaccine  HPV  types 
from  10  vaccinated  females  in  P007  in  an  antigen-binding  assay.  Cross-reactive  antibodies  were 
detected against HPV 31, 45, 52 and 58 virus-like particles (VLPs) and with similar kinetics as the 
vaccine types including persistence through 4 years postdose 3. Highest titers were observed for HPV 
45 and HPV 31, as could be expected based on their high degree of homologies to HPV 18 and HPV 
16, respectively. However, the total IgG titers were 1.5 to 2 logs lower than the anti-HPV 16 and 18 
titers. The antibodies were shown by a pseudovirus (PsV) neutralization tests to cross-neutralise HPV 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
45  and  HPV  31,  although  to  a  varying  degree.  These  data  demonstrated  that  cross-neutralisation 
antibodies  to  related  HPV  types  are  induced  by  Gardasil,  although  at  a  1-2  log  lower  level  than 
against  vaccine  types.  To  investigate  whether  these  reduced  antibody  titers  against  related  non-
vaccine types translate to clinically-meaningful cross-protection, the current cross-protection efficacy 
analyses were performed. 
An important objective of the clinical program for Gardasil was to determine whether the vaccine’s 
prophylactic  efficacy  extends  to  HPV  types  whose  L1  proteins  share  80%  homology  (at  the  amino 
acid level) with HPV 16 or HPV 18 and are responsible for >2% of cervical cancers. The HPV types 
meeting  these  criteria  are  HPV  types  31,  33,  45,  52,  and  58.  The  impact  of  the  vaccine  on  other 
oncogenic members of the A9 and A7 species, as well as members of the A5 and A6 species, was also 
to be evaluated. A11 species members were not evaluated since they very rarely cause cancer. 
Two pre-specified analyses were prospectively planned to meet these objectives: 
Protocol 012 (Infection Cross-Protection)  
• 
Protocol 012 was a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study including 3578 16- 
to 24-year-old subjects who were randomised to receive Gardasil or placebo. This study was used to 
evaluate the vaccine efficacy with respect to the combined incidence of persistent infection or disease 
caused  by  HPV  31,  33,  45,  52  and  58.  The  vaccine  efficacy  with  respect  to  infection  and  disease 
caused by other common HPV types was also evaluated.  
Protocols 013/015 combined (Disease Cross-Protection) 
• 
Protocols  013/015  (Future  I  and  II  studies)  involved  an  evaluation  of  the  efficacy  of  Gardasil  with 
respect to the combined incidence of HPV 31- or 45-related CIN (any grade) or AIS (primary) and the 
combined incidence of HPV 31-, 33-, 45-, 52-, or 58-related CIN (any grade) or AIS (secondary), as 
well as other oncogenic HPV types.  
Since submission of the Variation in April 2007, Protocol 013 and Protocol 015 have been completed, 
and  relevant  information  for  the  database  that  incorporates  the  additional  follow-up  of  the  cross-
protective  efficacy  population  was  submitted.  Analyses  of  the  End-of-Study  database  including  a 
mean follow-up duration of 3.59 years post enrolment were evaluated.

 Description 
This study, included in the MAA, was a substudy to P013 (Future I) that aimed at bridging anti-HPV 
16  responses  between  the  monovalent  HPV  16  vaccine  used  in  Protocol  005  and  the  quadrivalent 
vaccine. The study enrolled a total of 3882 16- to 24-year-old women from 13 countries (USA, EU, 
Latin America and the Pacific region). The subjects receiving the HPV 16 vaccine (n=304) completed 
the study at Month 7, whereas all subjects that received the quadrivalent vaccine or placebo (n=3588) 
continued  in  the  efficacy  part  of  the  P013  study.  According  to  the  provided  documentation  3578 
subjects were included in the cross-protection study.  
Of note is that P012 cross-infection analysis was  not powered to evaluate efficacy against infection 
caused by individual HPV types. HPV type-specific analyses were only supportive and descriptive.

Study populations  
Primary Analysis Population  
(cid:190)Modified  Intention-to-Treat-4  (MITT-4)  (included  all  subjects  who  were  PCR  negative  on  all 
specimens collected from Day 1 through Month 3 for the relevant HPV types, had received at least 2 
doses  of  vaccine/placebo  and  had  follow-up  following  Month  3):  This  population  approximates 
adolescent  and  young  adult  women  who  are  naïve  to  relevant  HPV  types  prior  to  receipt  of  a  full 
regimen of Gardasil. 
Supplemental Prophylactic Efficacy Analysis Populations 
(cid:190)Restricted  MITT-2  (RMITT-2)  Population  (included  all  subjects  who  were  seronegative  (4 
vaccine types) and PCR negative to all 14 HPV types at Day 1, had a negative Pap test, received at 
least one dose of vaccine/placebo and had at least one follow-up visit post-Day 30): This population 
corresponds  to  the  general  population  of  adolescent  girls  prior  to  sexual  debut  and  is  the  target 
population for mass vaccination. 
(cid:190)MITT-2 Population (included all subjects who were naïve to the relevant HPV types (HPV 31, 33, 
45, 52 and 58) at Day 1, received at least one dose of vaccine/placebo and had at least one follow-up 
visit post-Day 30): This population is the broadest efficacy population corresponding to the general 
population of adolescents prior to sexual debut and sexually active young women and corresponds to 
the primary target population in clinical practice. 
General population  
(cid:190)MITT-3  Population  (included  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  vaccine/placebo, 
regardless of HPV status at Day 1 and had at least one follow-up visit post-Day 30): This population 
included  women  infected  with  vaccine  and/or  non-vaccine  HPV  types  at  vaccination  onset  and 
provides a real world estimate of efficacy in the vaccinated population.  
The  vaccine  and  placebo  groups  were  well-balanced  with  respect  to  key  demographic,  behavioural 
and  sexually-transmitted  screening  parameters.  The  mean  age  of  subjects  was  20.2  years.  Overall, 
94% of the subjects were sexually active, 3.9% had sexual transmitted diseases (STD) and 11% had 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Pap  testing  finding  suggestive  of  HPV  infection  at  baseline.  Overall,  77.2%  of  the  population  was 
naïve to all 4 vaccine HPV types by PCR or serology. 
Overall 70.6 % of the study population was PCR negative at Day 1 to all 14 HPV types and 28.6% 
were PCR positive to at least one HPV type. HPV 16 was most common (8.2%) followed by HPV 51 
(5.9%), HPV 56 (5.2%) and HPV 39 (5.0%), whereas HPV 31 (3.9%) and HPV 45 (1.9%) were less 
common. 
1.2.1.2 Results 
As of the cut-off date for analysis of the clinical trials database, a total of 83.4% and 16.8% of the 
study subjects completed the scheduled Month 36 and Month 48 visits, respectively.  
Primary efficacy analysis using the 4 month definition  
Administration  of  Gardasil  reduced  the  combined  incidence  of  persistent  infection  (4  month 
definition) and disease related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 (vaccine efficacy (VE): 24.7%). Time to 
event  analysis  showed  that  vaccine  efficacy  increased  over  time  from  Month  7  until  Month  36.  By 
HPV  type,  reductions  were  largest  for  HPV  31  and  33  and  smallest  for  HPV  52  and  HPV  58.  The 
majority of endpoints were persistent infections. VE was not significant against cervical disease and 
External Genital Lesions (EGL) endpoints (lower bound of 95% CIs <0%).  
Efficacy estimates were comparable in the RMITT-2 and MITT-2 populations to those in the MITT-4. 
Vaccine  efficacy  was  somewhat  lower  in  the  MITT-3  population  that  included  also  women  with 
ongoing infections were included. 
Post-hoc  analysis:  Efficacy  with  respect  to  the  combined  incidence  of  HPV  31  and  HPV  45 
infection and disease using the 4 month definition 
HPV 31 and HPV 45 are the HPV types that share the closest homology with HPV 16 and HPV 18. It 
was  therefore  of  interest  to  assess  VE  against  these  HPV  types  (post-hoc  analysis).  Also,  it  was  of 
interest  to  provide  a  virological  context  for  the  cross-protection  disease  analysis.  In  MITT-4 
population VE was 47.7% (CIs 29.4, 61.5). Consistent VE against persistent infection and disease was 
observed  in  all  populations,  although  of  lower  magnitude  in  the  MITT-3  population.  VE  was  only 
significant for the HPV 31-related endpoint in all populations. 
Secondary  analysis:  Cross-protection  against  persistent  infection  or  disease  by  HPV  species 
using the 4 month definition 
Gardasil reduced the incidence of persistent infection/disease caused by non-HPV 16 A9 HPV species 
members (HPV 31, 33, 35, 52, 58) and by non-HPV 18 A7 HPV species members (HPV 45, 59) in 
similar magnitudes (around 20%). The non-HPV 16-A9-species members were most common.  
Cross-protective efficacy against persistent infection or disease at end of study 
The  MAH  in  the  response  to  the  RSI  submitted  the  analyses  regarding  persistent  infection  by 
diagnostic  visits  based  on  the  End-of-Study  cross-protection  efficacy  analysis,  which  extends  the 
follow-up  period  of  the  study  population  to  a  mean  of  3.59  years  after  enrollment.  Results  with 
respect to persistent infection were provided using the more established 6- and 12-month definitions 
(the same HPV type DNA detected in ≥1 sample obtained on  ≥2 consecutive visits that were ≥6 or 
≥12 months apart) 
End  of  Study  cross  protection  efficacy  analyses  regarding  persistent  infection  using  the  12 
month definition 
The  MITT-4  population  was  the  pre-defined  primary  efficacy  population  in  the  cross-protection 
persistent  infection  analysis.  Significant  results  were  observed  for  the  primary  endpoint,  HPV 
31/33/45/52/58-related  persistent  infection,  using  the  12-month  definition.  In  all  other  study 
populations, only trends towards efficacy were observed since the lower bounds of the 95% CIs were 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<0%. This was likely due to the lower number of endpoints detected using the 12 months persistence 
definition. 
As for the primary analysis, significant results were observed in the MITT-4 population for the post-
hoc endpoint, HPV 31/45-related persistent infection, using the 12-month definition. In all other study 
populations, only numerical reductions were observed (lower bounds of the 95% CIs <0%). 
Statistically  significant  efficacy was observed against persistent infection caused by HPV 31 across 
prophylactic populations based on any duration of infection (with detection at ≥2 consecutive visits) 
and  for  duration  of  infection  ≥12 months  (the  exception  was  the  RMITT-2  population  for  infection 
with a duration of ≥12 months for which the 95% CI on the efficacy estimate was <0%).  For all other 
individual  non-vaccine  HPV  types  analysed,  there  was  no  statistically  significant  efficacy  against 
persistent infection using the definitions included in these analyses. 
Efficacy  against  HPV  31/33/45/52/58-related  persistent  infection  at  end-of-study  using  the  6-
month definition 
By  use  of  the  6-month  definition  of  persistent  infection  statistically  significant  efficacy  against  the 
primary composite endpoints, HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related and HPV 31/45-related persistent infection 
was  observed  across  all  analysis  populations,  driven  largely  by  efficacy  against  persistent  infection 
caused by HPV 31 (Table 4).

Vaccine  efficacy  against  6-month  persistent  HPV  31-infection  was  almost  50%  in  the  prophylactic 
study  populations,  MITT-2  and  RMITT-2.  It  is  of  note  that  this  is  close  to  the  efficacy  estimate  of 
57% observed against HPV 31-related CIN 2/3 (if co-infected lesions were excluded).

Tables  5  and  6  present  the  end-of-study  analyses  of  efficacy  against  persistent  infection  related  to 
HPV 16 and 18 using the 6-month and 12-month definitions, respectively, based on the same study 
data. The analyses of efficacy against HPV 16/18-related persistent infection through the end-of-study 
timepoint  demonstrate  conclusively  that  the  vaccine  is  efficacious  against  these  endpoints  for  each 
HPV type and regardless of the duration of infection considered.

1.2.1.3 Discussion 
Data on the PCR test methodology for the non-vaccine HPV types provided by the MAH to ensure 
that  these  assays  were  validated  and  as  sensitive,  specific  and  robust  as  those  for  the  vaccine  HPV 
types were considered acceptable. 
The criteria to include the HPV types chosen in the primary endpoint (HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58), i.e. 
based  on  amino  acid  homology  (>80%)  with  L1  proteins  of  HPV  16  and  18  and  on  prevalence  in 
cervical cancer (>2%) are supported. However, the use of composite endpoints including several non-
vaccine HPV types is somewhat troublesome, e.g. if no vaccine efficacy is shown for certain types. 
On the other hand, the study could hardly be powered to demonstrate efficacy against each of the non-
vaccine HPV types, and therefore, a combined endpoint of the related HPV types could be used. The 
use of a composite endpoint requires specific statements in the SPC on the efficacy against individual 
components of the composite to make possible an appropriate interpretation of the results obtained. 
Infection cross-protection analysis 
In  the  infection  cross-protection  analysis  (mean  follow-up  3  years  post  enrolment),  the  success 
criterion for the primary hypothesis was met. Vaccine efficacy in the combined incidence of persistent 
HPV  31,  33,  45,  52  and  58  infection  and  HPV  31,  33,  45,  52,  58-related  genital  disease  compared 
with  placebo  was  modest,  24.7%  in  the  primary  efficacy  population  MITT-4.  The  magnitudes  of 
efficacy  for  persistent  infection,  CIN,  AIS  and  EGL  were  comparable,  but  statistically  significant

results were only shown for persistent infection. The results in the MITT-2 and RMITT-2 populations 
supported those obtained in the MITT-4. In the MITT-3 population efficacy estimates were lower, but 
benefit was still demonstrated, also in the disease endpoint.  
Cross-protective efficacy was not evaluated against EGL since most low-grade vulvar/vaginal lesions 
and genital warts are attributed to HPV 6 and 11. The role of non-vaccine HPV types in development 
of these lesions is relatively small. As regards high-grade vulvar and vaginal lesions and cancers the 
majority are related to oncogenic HPV types, in particular HPV 16. The limited number of cases with 
high-grade  vulvar  and  vaginal  lesions  precluded  any  meaningful  analyses  with  respect  to  cross-
protection.  
A post-hoc efficacy analysis with respect to the closest HPV 16/18-related types, HPV 31 and HPV 
45, showed larger reductions in the combined incidence of persistent infection and CIN disease, VE 
47.7%  in  the  MITT-4  population.  Efficacy  estimates  in  the  MITT-2  and  RMITT-2  were  of  similar 
magnitude.  However,  analyses  by  HPV  type  showed  that  efficacy  was  driven  by  HPV  31  and   
significant efficacy was not demonstrated for HPV 45 in any study population.  
With respect to individual non-vaccine HPV types, reductions in the combined incidence of persistent 
infection/CIN were largest for HPV 31 and 33. No relevant efficacy was seen for HPV 35, HPV 52 or 
HPV  58.  When  analysed  by  A9  and  A7  species  (non-vaccine  HPV  types),  similar  VE  estimates 
around 20% were obtained.   
This Infection Cross-Protection analysis was designed to provide a virologic context for the Disease 
Cross-Protection analysis, and to evaluate the vaccine efficacy against persistent infection.  However, 
the  4-month  definition  of  persistent  infection  is  not  endorsed  and  the  results could therefore not be 
accepted  as  presented  in  the  study  report.  The  WHO  consensus  paper  (Vaccine  2004)  defines 
persistent HPV infection as detection of the same HPV DNA in follow-up visits 6-12 months apart in 
women  naïve  for  the  relevant  type  at  baseline.  Since  the  definition  of  persistent  infection  was 
questioned several re-analyses were performed using the more established 6- and 12-month persistent 
infection. Statistically significant efficacy against the primary composite using the 6-month definition 
was observed across all analysis population at end of study. It was 21.8% (95% CI: 7.7, 33.8) in the 
MITT-2 population. In the secondary post-hoc composite (HPV 31/45) endpoint, vaccine efficacy was 
43.6% (95% CI: 27.2, 56.6) in the MITT-2 population. The efficacy was driven by HPV 16-related 
types,  primarily  HPV  31,  whereas  no  significant  efficacy  was  observed  for  HPV  18-related  types 
(including HPV 45). When analysed by individual HPV type, statistically significant results were only 
reached for HPV 31; vaccine efficacy was 49% (95% CI: 30.0, 63.1) in the MITT-2 population.  
An  updated  end-of-study  analysis  of  HPV  16  and  18  persistent  infection  was  also  provided, 
demonstrating  high  vaccine  efficacy;  99-100%  in  the  per-protocol  population  and  92-94%  in  the 
MITT-2 population, regardless of the duration of infection considered (6 or 12 months). These data 
merit to be mentioned in section 5.1 of the SPC.

Protocols 013 and 015 combined (Disease cross-protection analysis) 
1.2.2.1 Description 
The analysis of disease cross-protection was conducted in the combined database of P013 and P015. 
These  phase  III  efficacy  studies  enrolled  a  total  of  17,622  young  women  (P013  n=5,455  and  P015 
n=12,167). The populations in the 2 studies were generally comparable with regard to key enrollment 
parameters.  Both  studies  limited  enrollment  to  women  16  to  23  years  old  (P015  to  26  years  in  the 
Singapore site) with 4 or fewer life time sexual partners and excluded those with a history of genital 
warts and abnormal Pap test. 
The description of studies is introduced in Table 7.

Study Population  
Primary Analysis Population: MITT-2 Population 
included subjects who:  
-  were PCR negative to the relevant HPV type at Day 1,  
-  received at least one dose of vaccine/placebo 
-  had at least one follow-up visit post-Day 30  
Case counting started at Day 31 
Note:  because  P015  did  not  include  cervicovaginal  specimen  collection  at  Month  3,  it  was  not  possible  to 
conduct  an  analysis  in  the  MITT-4  population  in  the  Disease  Cross-Protection  Data  Set.  The  MITT-2 
population was chosen as a conservative approximation of this population. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis Population: RMITT-2 Population  
General Population: MITT-3 Population 
The criteria for inclusion into the RMITT-2 and MITT-3 are the same as for P012.

1.2.2.2 Results 
As of the cut-off date for analysis, a total of 88.7% (P013 84% and P015 91%) and 17.0% of subjects 
completed the scheduled Month 36 and Month 48 visits, respectively. 
The  vaccine  and  placebo  groups  were  well-balanced  with  respect  to  key  demographic,  behavioural 
and sexually-transmitted screening parameters. The mean age of subjects was 20.0 years.  
Primary efficacy analyses 
In  the  disease  cross-protection  analysis  with  respect  to  HPV  31/45-related  CIN  (any  grade)  or  AIS 
(mean follow up duration of 3.0 years), the success criterion for the primary hypothesis was not met 
in  the  primary efficacy population (MITT-2) (VE was 25.1%, 95% CI: -3.5; 46.0). VE against CIN 
2/3 was also non-significant (lower bound of 95% CI <0%). In the supporting analyses in the RMITT-
2  population,  higher  VE  was  found  against  CIN  (any  grade)  (VE:  45%,  95%  CI:  6.4;  68.4)  and 
importantly also against HPV 31/45-related CIN 2/3 (VE: 61.6%, 95% CI: 9.7, 85.3).  
Of note is that there were differences between the studies, with much lower efficacy estimates in the 
P015 study than in P013. In all study populations in P015, the lower bound of the 95% CI was <0% 
and no reductions in disease endpoints were observed in the vaccines compared with placebo. 
Analyses of End of Study database (mean follow up duration of 3.59 years) 
In the primary composite endpoint, HPV 31/45-related CIN (any grade) or AIS, vaccine efficacy was 
statistically  significant  in  all  populations;  37%  (95%  CI:  17.0;  52.8)  in  the  MITT-2  population 
(primary efficacy population), 44% (95% CI: 12.9; 64.1) in the RMITT-2 population and 23% (95% 
CI:  9.6;  31.3)    in  the  MITT-3  population.  With  regard  to  the  more  relevant  endpoint  HPV  31/45-
related CIN 2/3 the corresponding percentages were 43% (95% CI: 12.1; 63.9), 59% (95% CI: 14.1; 
81.5) and 21% (95% CI: -5.6; 41.7). The updated efficacy estimates were higher in the MITT-2 and -3 
populations  compared  with  those  in  the  original  cross-protection  analysis.  In  the  MITT-2  analyses 
significant  results  were  now  observed  (lower  95%  CI  bound  >0%).    The  results  in  the  RMITT-2 
population  were  somewhat  lower,  but  consistent  with those in the original cross-protection efficacy 
analysis.  
Secondary efficacy analyses 
In the disease cross-protection analysis with  respect to HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related CIN/AIS (mean 
follow up duration of 3.0 years), the success criterion for the secondary hypothesis was met. VE was 
18.6%  (95%  CI:  1.0,  33.2)  in  the  MITT-2  population.  The  analysis  in  the  RMITT-2  and  MITT-3 
populations supported the results obtained in the primary population. However, the magnitude of VE 
was modest with wide 95% confidence intervals in all analyses. When evaluated by disease severity, 
VE  against  CIN  2/3  was  43.3%  (95%  CI:  7.3,  66.0)  in  the  RMITT-2  population,  but  substantially 
lower in the MITT-2 (VE: 16%, ns) and MITT-3 (VE:9.8%, ns). 
With regard to AIS, there were 6 placebo cases (HPV 45 (n=1), HPV 52 (n=4), HPV 58 (n=1)) and 1 
vaccine case (HPV 52) who were diagnosed with AIS. There were no cases of cervical cancer. 
As for the primary analysis, in P015, the lower bound of the 95%CI was <0% in all efficacy analyses 
and no reductions in disease endpoints were observed in the vaccinees compared with placebo. 
Analyses of End of Study database (mean follow up duration of 3.59 years) 
In  the  secondary  composite  endpoint  HPV  31/33/45/52/58-related  CIN  (any  grade),  VE  was 
statistically  significant  in  all  populations;  26%  (MITT-2  95%  CI:  12.9;  37.8),  29%  (RMITT-2 95% 
CI: 8.3; 45.5) and 20% (MITT-3 95% CI: 8.2; 29.6).  VE against HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related CIN 2/3 
or  AIS  was  only  significant  in  the  MITT-2  population  (26%  95%  CI:  4.6;  42.5),  whereas  only 
numerical reductions were seen in the RMITT-2 (33% 95% CI: -0.3; 55.0) and MITT-3 (14% 95% CI: 
-3.3;  28.8).  The  updated  efficacy  estimates  were  somewhat  higher  (MITT-2  and  -3)  than  those 
observed  in  the  original  cross-protection  efficacy  analysis.  In  the  RMITT-2  analyses  of  efficacy 
against CIN 2/3, estimates were lower with the lower 95% CI bound <0%.

Analysis of vaccine efficacy against individual HPV types 
The  studies  were  not  powered  to  assess  efficacy  against  disease  caused  by  individual  types,  HPV 
type-specific analyses were only supportive and descriptive. 
Efficacy was primarily driven by reductions in the HPV 31-related endpoint (VE 38.4% for MITT-2 
population  and  VE  59.8%  for  RMITT-2  population)  (mean  follow  up  duration  of  3.0  years).  No 
significant  efficacy  was  observed  for  the  other  members  of  the  HPV  A9  species.  In  particular,  no 
efficacy was observed relative to HPV 45 (A7 species member). To evaluate the impact of Gardasil 
on  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  post-hoc  analyses excluding the HPV 45-related endpoints 
were also conducted. 
Analyses of vaccine efficacy against HPV31/33/45/52/58-related CIN 2/3 by HPV type - End of 
Study database (mean follow up duration of 3.59 years) 
Upon CHMP request the MAH submitted the analyses of vaccine efficacy with regard to CIN 2/3 or 
AIS caused by selected HPV types of the combined database of protocols 013/ 015 at End-of-Study. 
The  results  are  presented  in  table  8  below.  As  regards  individual  HPV  types,  only  for  HPV  31 
significant efficacy against CIN 2/3 was demonstrated, with VE 70% in the RMITT-2 population and 
VE 56% in the MITT-2 population.

Post-hoc analyses: Exclusion of HPV 45-related endpoints 
Analyses of End of Study database (mean follow up duration of 3.59 years) showed significant results 
against CIN (any grade) and CIN 2/3 in both prophylactic populations (VE: 31% (MITT-2) and VE: 
37% (RMITT-2)), but not in the MITT-3 population. VE as regards CIN (any grade) was 30% (MITT-
2) and 34% (RMITT-2). 
Cross-protective efficacy against CIN 2/3 or AIS due to any HPV type 
End of study results  (mean follow up duration of 3.59 years) 
End of study results showed that administration of Gardasil reduced the overall incidence of CIN 2/3 
or AIS due to any HPV type by 42.7% in the RMITT-2 population, 33.8% in the MITT-2 population 
and by 18.4% in the MITT-3 population. 
13 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With regard to all non-vaccine types Gardasil resulted in a non-significant reduction in the incidence 
of  CIN  2/3  or  AIS  for  all  studied  populations,  23.6%  in  RMITT-2  population,  16.2%  in  MITT 
population and 9.0% in MITT -3 population.  
The negative findings with respect to efficacy against other non-vaccine HPV types (not tested for) 
could be explained due to the masking effect, rather than to a HPV type replacement phenomenon. 
HPV type replacement analysis  
The question whether there would be an upsurge of persistent infection and disease caused by non-
vaccine  HPV  types  was  investigated  by  using  the  P012  and  the  combined  P013/P015  infection  and 
disease cross-protection databases, respectively. The analyses focused on the RMITT-2 and MITT-3 
populations. 
For the infection cross-protection analyses, the rates of persistent infection, CIN, AIS or EGL caused 
by non-vaccine type individually and as a composite were compared by vaccination groups. 
For the disease cross-protection analyses, the rates of CIN (any grade) or AIS or, of CIN 2/3 or AIS, 
overall, caused by vaccine HPV types and caused by non-vaccine HPV types were compared between 
vaccination groups. 
Results on HPV type replacement analysis - Protocol 012 
In the RMITT-2 population the incidence of persistent infection and CIN (any grade) or AIS caused 
by non-vaccine types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, 58, 59) was reduced by 19.7% (-0.3 to 35.8%) in the 
vaccine  group  compared  with  placebo.  Reductions  were  observed  for  all  HPV  types  within  the 
composite endpoint with the exception of HPV 58 (30 cases in the vaccine group vs. 29 cases in the 
placebo group). 
In the MITT-3 population the rate of persistent infection and CIN (any grade) or AIS caused by non-
vaccine  types  was  reduced  by  15.1%  (2.8  to  17.2%)  compared  with  placebo.  Reductions  were 
observed for all HPV types within the composite endpoint. 
These data do not suggest HPV type replacement; rather there was some evidence of cross-protection 
against non-vaccine HPV types for which testing was performed. 
Results on HPV type replacement analysis - Protocol 013/015 
In  the  RMITT-2  population  the  incidence  of  CIN  (any  grade)/AIS  or  CIN  2/3/AIS  caused  by  non-
vaccine types was reduced by 18% (0.3 to 32.7%) and 25.3% % (-8.7 to 48.9%) respectively, in the 
vaccine  group  compared  with  placebo.  The  strongest  reduction  was  observed  for  HPV  31  (76.1%) 
whereas for HPV 35 and HPV 45 no efficacy was seen. 
In  the  MITT-3  population  the  incidence  of  CIN  (any  grade)/AIS  or  CIN  2/3/AIS  caused  by  non-
vaccine  types  was  reduced  by  8.2%  (-1.6  to  17.2%)  and  4.5%  (-12.9  to  19.2%)  respectively,  in  the 
vaccine group compared with placebo. For HPV 45 and HPV 56 no efficacy was seen. 
It was noted that with respect to “other HPV type-related” CIN i.e. CIN due to a HPV type for which 
testing was not done and “other HPV type-related” CIN 2/3 i.e. CIN 2/3 due to a HPV type for which 
testing was not done, there were more cases in the vaccine group than placebo. For CIN (any grade) 
there were 74 vs. 71 cases in the vaccine and placebo group, respectively, in the RMITT-2 population 
and 161 vs. 140 cases in the MITT-2 population. For CIN 2/3 there were similar findings with 20 vs. 9 
cases  in  the  RMITT-2  and  70  vs.  59  cases  in  the  MITT-3.  The  negative  findings  with  respect  to 
efficacy  against  “other  HPV  type-related”  (not  tested  for)  could  be  explained  due  to  the  masking 
effect, rather than to a HPV type replacement phenomenon.  
Contributions of oncogenic HPV types to CIN lesions and AIS 
The contributions of oncogenic HPV types to CIN 1, CIN 2, and CIN 3 vary. It is of note that non-
HPV 16/18 oncogenic HPV types are much more commonly detected in CIN 1, 2, and 3 lesions than 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
in cervical cancer cases. Also, detection of more than one HPV type in a given CIN biopsy specimen 
is  common.  HPV  16  is  unique  in  that  the  proportions  of  lesions  that  are  HPV  16-positive  increase 
with histopathologic grade severity. 
The  cumulative  incidence  (through  end  of  study)  of  CIN  2/3  or  AIS  lesions  by  HPV  type  in  the 
placebo group within the RMITT-2 population of the Combined Protocol 013/015 is shown in Figure 
1-1. The incidence of HPV 16-related CIN 2/3 was the highest, followed by CIN 2/3 caused by other 
Species A9 members and HPV 18.

The HPV types differ substantially by malignant potential with HPV 16 and HPV 18 being the most 
oncogenic  HPV  types.  For  non-HPV  16/18  types,  CIN  2/3  rarely  progress  to  cervical  cancer.  The 
spectrum of disease is thus different, and the use of CIN 2/3 related to oncogenic non-vaccine HPV 
types as a surrogate marker for cervical cancer could be discussed. However, all over the world, the 
detection of CIN 2/3 regardless of HPV type leads to excision of the lesion and therefore the clinical 
impact of CIN 2/3 caused by oncogenic non-vaccine HPV types  will be the same as for HPV 16/18.  
It  is  noteworthy  that  the  contribution  of  non-HPV  16  A9  species  types  to  CIN  2/3  or  AIS  is 
considerably  larger  than  that  for  HPV  18.  Data  were  only  given  for  the  most  restricted  population. 
Upon CHMP request the MAH provided data for the MITT-3 population, which were consistent with 
the findings in the RMITT-2 population, The cumulative incidence of CIN 2/3 related to HPV 31 and 
HPV 52 was higher than that of HPV 18, whereas HPV 58 and HPV 33 were as common as HPV 18. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, the prevalence of non-vaccine HPV types in CIN 2/3 is not as rare as perceived. However, 
it is applicable to HPV 45, which was the least frequent oncogenic non-vaccine HPV type observed in 
the studies.  
Quantification of the clinical benefit of the cross-protective efficacy 
The  calculations  at  the  end  of  study  demonstrated  that,  when  accounting  for  co-infection,  0.9  HPV 
32/33/52/58-related  CIN  2/3  cases  per  1000  subjects  vaccinated  were  prevented  in  the  RMITT-2 
population  and  0.7  cases  in  the  MITT-2  population.  This  translates  to  a  net  benefit  of  4  and  6 
additional  cases  prevented.  For  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  2/3  (regardless  of  presence  of  HPV 
31/33/52/58),  there  were  17.7  prevented  cases  per  1000  subjects  vaccinated  in  the  RMITT-2 
population and 15.6 cases in the MITT-2. 
1.2.2.3 Discussion 
The  disease  cross-protection  analysis  was  performed  in  the  combined  phase  III  efficacy  trials 
including  17,599  16  -to  26  year-old  women.  An  analysis  of  the  combined  study  data,  instead  of 
studies 013 and 015 separately, would give adequate power for demonstration of cross-protection and 
would  improve  the  precision  of  vaccine  efficacy.  Nevertheless,  this  type  of  combined  analysis  was 
already accepted for the marketing authorisation application and is therefore considered appropriate. 
The follow-up was for 3 years from start of enrolment, but was updated in the MAH response to the 
RSI with the End-of-Study results at 3.59 years. As was shown in the efficacy time-to-event analyses, 
cross-protective  efficacy  was  only  evident  after  12  months  following  start  of  immunisation  and 
increased over time. However, this repeated testing of data raises a multiplicity concern. 
The cross-protection endpoints should have focused on high-grade CIN lesions (CIN 2/3) rather than 
CIN (any grade) or AIS. The vaccine has only been approved for the prevention of HPV 16- and HPV 
18-related  CIN  2/3,  which  should  also  apply  for  an  indication  with  respect  to  related  non-vaccine 
oncogenic  HPV  types.  As  the  analyses  for  cross-protective  efficacy  against  CIN  2/3  due  to  non-
vaccine  types  were  also  provided,  this  concern  is  resolved.  Low-grade  cervical  dyplasia  is  not 
considered  a  relevant  disease  endpoint  and  the  proposed  text  for  section  4.1  of  the  SPC  is  not 
acceptable.  Adenocarcinoma  in  situ  (AIS)  has  also  not  been  accepted  in  the  indication  for  vaccine 
HPV  types.  The  data  provided  on  AIS  (altogether  7  cases)  in  the  cross-protection  analysis  are 
insufficient  to  support  an  indication.  However,  since  AIS  has  been  included  as  part  of  high-grade 
cervical lesion endpoint (CIN 2/3 or AIS) in all efficacy trials, it is appropriate to mention this disease 
category in the SPC section 5.1 
The use of composite efficacy endpoints, including pre-specified combinations of non-vaccine HPV 
types, could be questioned. The non-vaccine types are not uncommon causes of CIN lesions, but due 
to  the  anticipated  lower  vaccine  efficacy  against  non-HPV  16/18  types  more  endpoints  would  be 
necessary  to  obtain  statistical  significance.  The  MAH´s  justification  with  respect  to  this  aspect 
including  the  biology-based  selection  of  HPV  types  could  be  accepted,  as  long  as  the  analyses  of 
individual  components  support  the  overall  conclusion  given  by  the  composite.  However,  composite 
endpoints make interpretation of data difficult, since the vaccine might not be efficacious against all 
of  the  types  evaluated,  as  was  also  seen  in  the  combined  dataset.  No  significant  efficacy  could  be 
demonstrated for HPV 45, which was used in the primary efficacy endpoint in combination with HPV 
31  and  in  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  in  combination  with  HPV  31,  33,  52  and  58.  The  pre-
specified composite endpoints should be mentioned in the SPC, but require specific statements on the 
efficacy against individual components of the composite to facilitate an appropriate interpretation of 
the results. Since HPV type-specific analyses were defined as descriptive and supportive, the lack of 
adjustment of multiplicity is considered acceptable. 
The high frequency of baseline PCR positivity to vaccine (14.8%) and related non-vaccine HPV types 
(14.8%)  is  noted.  In  the  response  to  the  RSI,  the  MAH  addressed  the  geographical  distribution  of 
HPV types in the combined P013/P015 database and showed that HPV prevalence was in accordance 
with  the  data  described  in  the  literature.  It  was  clarified  that  HPV  prevalence  and  HPV  type 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution  depend  heavily  on  study  populations  (age,  sexual  characteristics)  and  associated  HPV-
related  lesions  and  could  therefore  differ  between  epidemiological  studies.  HPV  16  has  been 
consistently  found  to  be  the  most  prevalent  HPV  type  worldwide,  which  was  also  observed  in  the 
013/015  studies.  The  high  prevalence  of  some  of  the  non-vaccine  HPV  types,  such  as  HPV  51 and 
HPV  56,  is  an  expected  finding  since  there  types  cause  a  substantial  number  of  CIN  1  lesions,  but 
rarely cause CIN 3 or result in cervical cancer The causal role of any of the HPV types identified in 
CIN 2/3 lesions will be ascribed the most oncogenic HPV type, i.e. HPV 16 and 18. 
The  subjects  with  multiple  HPV  types  were  characterised  by  sexual  demographics  and  disease 
severity.  It  was  shown  that  subjects  who  were  positive  to  multiple  HPV  types  Day  1  were  more 
sexually experienced. As regards CIN 2/3, more cases with multiple HPV types in the lesions were 
seen  in  the  placebo  group  (~40%)  than  in  the  vaccine  group  (~30%).  Very  few  subjects  had  co-
infection with more than 3 types. This high prevalence of co-infections with several HPV types makes 
the  assessment  of  vaccine  efficacy  for  cross-protection  difficult.  The  most  common  2-type 
combination involved HPV 16 in combination with other HPV types such as HPV 18, HPV 51 and 
HPV 52. 
A major concern in the initial assessment was that in the combined analysis of the pivotal phase III 
trials evidence of cross-protective efficacy was not convincingly demonstrated in the largest and most 
important P015 trial. With the provision of the end-of-study results including an extended follow-up 
to  a  mean  of  3.59  years  with  more  endpoints  accrued,  consistency  between  the  two  studies  with 
respect  to  improved  cross-protective  efficacy  was  shown.  The  sources  of  variability  were 
satisfactorily addressed by the MAH. The homogeneity test did not detect differences in the protocols 
for various endpoints. 
Cross-protective efficacy results 
In  the  updated  end-of-study  analyses,  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  cross-protection  analysis,  HPV 
31/45-related CIN (any grade), met the success criterion in all study populations with vaccine efficacy 
of 37% in the primary MITT-2 population, 44% in the RMITT-2 and 23% in the MITT-3 population. 
In  the  analyses  of  efficacy  against  CIN  2/3,  significant  results  were  obtained  in  the  MITT-2  (VE: 
43%) and RMITT-2 (VE: 59%), whereas in the MITT-3 (VE: 21%) the lower bound of the 95% CI 
was <0 %. However, the results were driven by reductions in HPV 31-related endpoints, whereas no 
efficacy could be confirmed for HPV 45. 
With respect to the secondary endpoint, the combined incidence of HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related CIN 
(any grade), the success criterion was fulfilled in all study populations. However, VE was modest in 
the primary population (VE: 26%) and also in the RMITT-2 (VE: 29%) and MITT-3 populations (VE: 
20%).  In  the  more  important  CIN  2/3  endpoint  vaccine  efficacy  was  26%  (95%  CI:  5,  43)  in  the 
primary  population,  whereas  statistically  significant  results  were  not  obtained  in  the  RMITT-2 
population (VE: 33% (95% CI: 0, 55).  
With respect to HPV species, the results give evidence of some cross-protective efficacy against the 
composite of non-vaccine A9 HPV species members including HPV types related to HPV 16. Vaccine 
efficacy  against  HPV  31/33/52/58-related  CIN  2/3  was  31%  (MITT-2)  and  37%  (RMITT-2). 
However,  no  statistically  significant  efficacy  was  demonstrated  for the  HPV  18-related  non-vaccine 
types (A7 HPV species) individually or combined. 
With respect to individual HPV types, only for HPV 31 cross-protective efficacy was confirmed. This 
HPV  type  has  the  closest  structural  relatedness  to  HPV  16.  In  the  primary  MITT-2  population, 
statistically significant results were obtained against HPV 31-related CIN 2/3 with VE of 56% (95% 
CI: 26, 74) and in the RMITT-2 population it was 70% (95% CI: 32, 88). In the MITT-3 population 
only numerical reductions were observed (VE: 27% (95% CI -1.1, 48). For all other individual HPV 
types  no  statistically  significant  efficacy  against  CIN  2/3  was  demonstrated.  Since  the  studies  were 
not powered to assess efficacy against disease caused by individual types, HPV type-specific analyses 
were only supportive and descriptive.  
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, larger magnitude of cross-protection was observed for high-grade CIN lesions (CIN 2/3) 
than for low-grade cervical lesions.  
The  non-significant  efficacy  results  observed  with  respect  to  HPV  45-related  endpoints  was 
unexpected  in  view  of  the  MAH´s  data  demonstrating  that  Gardasil  induced  a  cross-neutralization 
immune response to HPV 18, as reported in the MAA. In these laboratory experiments it was shown 
that anti-HPV responses induced by Gardasil prevented cell uptake of HPV 31 and HPV 45 VLPs, but 
2  log  higher  antibody  titres  were  required  for  cross-neutralization.  The  reasons  for  the  negative 
outcome in the cross-protection analyses remain unknown. 
significant  efficacy  was  demonstrated 
In conclusion, the updated cross-protective efficacy results obtained in the end-of study analyses met 
the  success  criterion  in  all  study  populations  and  for  the  defined  composite  endpoints.  Vaccine 
efficacy  was  modest  in  the  primary  HPV  31/45-related  CIN  endpoint  and  was  only  driven  by 
reductions  in  HPV  31-related  endpoints.  No  efficacy  could  be  confirmed  for  any  of  the  other 
individual  HPV  types  included  in  the  composite  endpoint.  There  is,  however, evidence  that  the 
vaccine  exerts  some  cross-protection  against certain  HPV-16  related  non-vaccine  HPV  types.   No 
statistically 
for the  HPV  18-related  non-vaccine 
types individually  or combined.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the  modest  efficacy  observed  was 
satisfactorily addressed by the MAH. However, with regard to the non-vaccine types, the oncogenic 
potential  differs  profoundly  from  that  of  the  vaccine  HPV  16/18  types  with  the  non-vaccine  HPV 
types  being  commonly  detected  in  CIN  1,  CIN  2  and  CIN  3  lesions,  but  rarely  in  cervical  cancers. 
Hence, the type-specific spectrum of diseases differs by grades of histopathological severity. HPV 16 
is unique in that the proportions of positive lesions increase with severity. The correlation of CIN 2/3 
(surrogate  endpoint  for  cervical  cancer)  with  cancer  is,  thus,  substantially  lower  for  the  oncogenic 
non-vaccine types. For this reason and given the modest efficacy against CIN 2/3 observed for non-
vaccine  HPV  types  cross-protection  is  to  be  regarded  as  an  added  benefit  only  to  be  mention  in 
section  5.1  of  the  SPC.  The  MAH  agreed  to  withdraw  the  request for an extension of indication to 
limit  this  application  to  the  update  of  section  5.1  and  this  type  II  variation  is  thereby  considered 
approvable.  
Cross-protective efficacy against CIN 2/3 or AIS due to any HPV type 
Overall Gardasil reduced the incidence of CIN 2/3 due to any HPV type by 42.7% in the RMITT-2 
population, by 33.8 % in the MITT-2 population and by 18.4 % in the MITT-3 population during the 
extended  3.6-year  follow-up.  This  magnitude  of  efficacy  is  clinically  relevant  in  the  RMITT-2 
population, but seems low, based on the attributed burden of CIN 2/3 disease of vaccine (70%) + non-
vaccine (24-39%) HPV types. The RMITT-2 population is the population most resembling sexually 
naïve  subjects  (target  population  for  general  vaccination  programmes),  but  there  are  no  means  to 
exclude baseline HPV infections/diseases not tested for (6 oncogenic HPV types) even by Pap testing. 
The overall efficacy in the MITT-3 population was very low due to the fact that these subjects were 
included  regardless  of  HPV  status  with  ongoing  infection/disease  at  the  start  of  vaccination.  Time 
event curves have shown that efficacy increased by time. 
With  regard  to  all  non-vaccine  HPV  types,  included  those  not  tested  for,  Gardasil  resulted  in  non-
significant reductions of related CIN2/3 in all study populations.   
The MAH provided a literature overview and update the SPC with respect to proportion of CIN 2/3 
related to different oncogenic HPV types. 
HPV type replacement analysis  
The  HPV  type  replacement  issue  is  an  important  commitment  for  the  MAH  to  pursue  in  the  post-
marketing  period,  which  requires  long-term  population  based  evaluations.  The  current  data  at  3.59 
years of follow-up in the pivotal efficacy studies 012/015, do not suggest the occurrence of HPV type 
replacement  by  the  10  non-vaccine  types  for  which  testing  was  performed.  However,  there  was  an 
increased  number  of  cases  with  CIN  2/3  caused  by  other  HPV  types  (not  tested  for)  in  the vaccine 
group  compared  to  placebo.  This  might  be  artefactual  and  explained  by  a  masking  effect  of  the 
vaccine  rather  than  a  replacement  phenomenon.  HPV  type  replacement  is  an  ongoing  important 
commitment  that  requires  long-term  surveillance  to  give  reliable  results  and  will  be  the  subject  of 
future assessment.

The CHMP considers that this extension of therapeutic indication does not require revised Risk 
Management Plan. 
1.4  Overall discussion and Benefit/Risk assessment 
The aim of this variation application was to evaluate whether administration of Gardasil impacts on 
the  incidences  of  infection  and  cervical  disease  caused  by  non-vaccine  types. The HPV types to be 
assessed  were  selected  for  cross-protective  efficacy  evaluations  based  on  the  known  homology  of 
their L1 proteins with those of HPV 16 and HPV 18 (>80% homology) and the relative contribution 
of  each  vaccine  type  to  cervical  cancer  (responsible  for  ≥2%  of  cervical  cancers).  The  HPV  types 
meeting these criteria are HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.  Of these, HPV 31 and HPV 45, share the 
highest level of homology with vaccine HPV types 16 and 18. The selection criteria of HPV types are 
considered relevant. 
Evaluations  were  conducted  with  respect  to  clinical  disease  endpoints  (cervical  intraepithelial 
neoplasia (CIN, any grade), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)) in the combined study of Protocol 013/015 
and  virological  endpoints  (persistent  infection)  in  Protocol  012  (substudy  to  P013).  With respect to 
disease endpoints high-grade CIN (CIN 2/3) lesions should have been the primary endpoint. Data on 
CIN 2/3 were, however, provided for all analyses, and should constitute the basis for approval. With 
respect to persistent infection, an unacceptable definition was used in study 012 (4-month definition) 
but  upon  request  data  on  the  more  established  6-month  and  12-month  persistent  infection  were 
provided.  
Vaccine efficacy was evaluated with respect to combined endpoints, i.e. HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related 
persistent infection and CIN/AIS and HPV 31/45-related CIN/AIS. Data were also provided by A7/A9 
species  and  on  each  HPV  type.  The  CHMP considers that the use of composite endpoints could be 
acceptable  since  it  is  based  on  defined  biological  and  epidemiologic  principles.  However,  the 
difficulty in using such endpoints was clearly illustrated by the results obtained in the clinical trials, 
with only one HPV type (HPV 31-related CIN 2/3) attaining statistical significant results. It is also of 
note that the MAH in the proposed indication excluded HPV 45 type from the pre-defined composite 
endpoint.  
The efficacy results were generally comparable between P012 infection cross-protection analysis and 
the combined Protocol 013/015 Disease Cross-Protection data set. 
The  updated  cross-protective  efficacy  results  obtained  in  the  end-of  study  analyses  (after  a  mean 
follow-up  of  3.59  years)  met  the  success  criterion  in  all  study  populations  and  for  the  defined 
composite  endpoints.  Vaccine  efficacy  was  very  modest  in  the  primary  HPV  31/45-related  CIN 
endpoint and was only driven by reductions in HPV 31-related endpoints. Against HPV 31, the type 
most structurally related to HPV 16, vaccine efficacy was 70% against related CIN 2/3 in the RMITT-
2 population and 56% in the broader MITT-2 population. No efficacy could be confirmed for any of 
the  other  individual  HPV  types  included  in  the  composite  endpoint.  There  is,  however,  definite 
evidence  that  the  vaccine  exerts  some  cross-protection  against  HPV-16  related  non-vaccine  HPV 
types  (A9  species),  whereas  no  statistically  significant  efficacy  was  demonstrated  for the  HPV  18-
related  (A7 species) non-vaccine types individually or combined,The clinical relevance of the modest 
efficacy  observed  was  satisfactorily  addressed  by  the  MAH.  The  calculations  at  the  end  of  study 
demonstrated that, when accounting for co-infection, 0.9 HPV 32/33/52/58-related CIN 2/3 cases per 
1000  subjects  vaccinated  were  prevented  in  the  RMITT-2  population  and  0.7  cases  in  the  MITT-2 
population.  This  translates  to  a  net  benefit  of  4  and  6  additional  cases  prevented.  For  HPV  16/18-
related  CIN  2/3  (regardless  of  presence  of  HPV  31/33/52/58),  there  were  17.7  prevented  cases  per 
1000 subjects vaccinated in the RMITT-2 population and 15.6 cases in the MITT-2. However, with 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
regard to the non-vaccine types, the oncogenic potential differs profoundly from that of the vaccine 
HPV 16/18 types with the non-vaccine HPV types being commonly detected in CIN 1, CIN 2 and CIN 
3 lesions, but rarely result in cervical cancers. Hence, the type-specific spectrum of diseases differs by 
grades  of  histopathological  severity.  HPV  16  is  unique  in  that  the  proportions  of  positive  lesions 
increase with severity. The correlation of CIN 2/3 (surrogate endpoint for cervical cancer) with cancer 
is,  thus,  substantially  lower  for  the  oncogenic  non-vaccine  types.  Cross-protective  efficacy  must 
therefore be evaluated differently with regard to cervical cancer than efficacy for vaccine HPV types. 
The  cross-protective  efficacy  was  also  very  modest  compared with that against vaccine HPV types. 
Moreover,  case  ascertainment  in  disease  endpoints  was  confounded  by  frequent  occurrence  of  co-
infections with vaccine and vaccine HPV types.  For this reason, and since only modest efficacy was 
demonstrated, the CHMP considers that cross-protection should not be included in the indication. It is 
an added benefit that should be mentioned in section 5.1 of the SPC. Moreover, the inclusion of low-
grade lesions and AIS in the proposed indication as well as the use of a post-hoc composite endpoint 
is not acceptable. Following CHMP request the MAH agreed to withdraw the request for an extension 
of indication to limit this application to the update of section 5.1 and this type II variation is thereby 
considered approvable. 
1.5 
Changes to the product information 
Further  to  the  assessment  of  the  different  proposals  of  the  MAH  to  amend the Product Information 
and  in  the  light  of  the  assessment  of  the  submitted  data,  the  Product  Information  was  revised  as 
follows: 
SPC 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication”  
The  MAH’s  initially  proposed  to  extend the approved indication to include protection against HPV 
31-, 33- 52- and 58-related low- and high-grade cervical dysplasia and cervical adenocarcinoma in situ 
(AIS) based on submission of supplementary data on non-vaccine types. 
The claims for the requested indication were not accepted by the CHMP and were withdrawn by the 
MAH. This section remains unchanged. 
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use”  
The warning concerning Gardasil protection against diseases caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 
was  revised  to  include  protection  against  diseases  caused  by  certain  related  HPV  types.  A  cross 
reference to section 5.1 was included. 
“Gardasil will only protect against diseases that are caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and to a 
limited extent against diseases caused by certain related HPV types (See section 5.1).” 
Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties”  
The paragraph on data on persistent infection caused by vaccine HPV types from protocols 005 and 
007 was replaced by results from protocol 012 as follows: 
“In  Protocol  012,  the  efficacy  of  Gardasil  against  the  6  month  definition  of  persistent  infection 
[samples positive on two or more consecutive visits 6 months apart (±1 month) or longer] related to 
HPV 16 was 98.7 % (95% CI: 95.1, 99.8) and 100.0% (95% CI: 93.2, 100.0) for HPV 18 respectively, 
after  a  follow-up  of  up  to  4  years  (mean  of  3.6  years).    For  the  12  month  definition  of  persistent 
infection, efficacy against HPV 16 was 100.0 % (95% CI: 93.9, 100.0) and 100.0 % (95% CI: 79.9, 
100.0) for HPV 18 respectively.” 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results on cross-protective efficacy were included as follows: 
“Cross-protective efficacy 
The efficacy of Gardasil against CIN (any grade) and CIN 2/3 or AIS caused by 10 non-vaccine HPV 
types  (HPV  31,  33,  35,  39,  45,  51,  52,  56,  58,  59)  structurally  related  to  HPV  16  or  HPV  18  was 
evaluated  in  the  combined  Phase  III  efficacy  database  (N  =  17,599)  after  a  mean  follow-up  of  3.0 
years  and  3.6  years  (at  end  of  study).  Efficacy  against  disease  endpoints  caused  by  pre-specified 
combinations  of  non-vaccine  HPV  types  was  measured.  The  studies  were  not  powered  to  assess 
efficacy against disease caused by individual HPV types. 
The primary analysis was done in type-specific populations that required women to be negative for 
the  type  being  analyzed,  but  who  could  be  positive  for  other  HPV  types  (96%  of  the  overall 
population). The primary time point analysis after 3 years did not reach statistical significance for all 
pre-specified endpoints. The final end-of-study results for the combined incidence of CIN 2/3 or AIS 
in this population after a follow-up of up to 4 years (mean of 3.6 years) are shown in Table 3. For 
composite endpoints, statistically significant efficacy against disease was demonstrated against HPV 
types  phylogenetically  related  to  HPV  16  (primarily  HPV  31)  whereas  no  statistically  significant 
efficacy was observed for HPV types phylogenetically related to HPV 18 (including HPV 45). For the 
10 individual HPV types, statistical significance was only reached for HPV 31.”

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH submitted on 7 January 2014 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Lixiana, through the centralised procedure 
under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure 
was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 22 September 2011.  
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
-  Prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism  in  adult  patients  with  nonvalvular  atrial  fibrillation 
(NVAF) with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, 
diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). 
-  Treatment  of  venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  including  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  and 
pulmonaryembolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent VTE in adults. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that edoxaban was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, 
non-clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0028/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0028/2014 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the  applicant  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance edoxaban contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance in itself, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of 
a product previously authorised within the Union.

Scientific Advice 
Scientific Advice from the EMEA was sought on 24 April 2008, 22 January 2009 and 14 April 2011 for 
the development of the NVAF indication. As a result of these meetings, a number of approaches were 
agreed  and  changes  to  the  Phase  3  pivotal  study  made.  Some  of  the  key  points  are  summarized 
hereafter: a) The doses for Phase 3 were agreed to be acceptable; b) The primary efficacy and safety 
endpoints were acceptable and a focus on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was established; c) 
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  clarified  and  in  particular  subjects  with  AF  secondary  to 
severe valvular disease were excluded while subjects with bioprosthetic valves were permitted; d) 
The justification for the non-inferiority margin and the statistical testing to support a single pivotal 
study  were  not  fully  agreed.  It  was  agreed  that  the  primary  analysis  for  the  EU  would  be  the 
per-protocol  population  and  the  overall  study  period  and  the  results  would  need  to  be  consistent 
across the endpoints.  
For  the  development  of  the  VTE  indication,  scientific  advice  was  sought  from  the  CHMP  on  24 
September 2009: a) The doses for Phase 3 were agreed to be acceptable; b)The primary efficacy and 
safety  endpoints  were  acceptable  and  a  focus  on  cardiovascular  mortality  was  established;  c)The 
justification for the non-inferiority margin and the statistical testing to support a single pivotal study 
were not fully resolved. In response to regulatory feedback, the non-inferiority margin of the study 
was  made  more  stringent  so  that  a  minimum  of  70%  of  the  efficacy  of  the  heparin  and  warfarin 
regimen  was  maintained;  d)  A  point  of  concern  for  the  CHMP  was  the  decision  for  duration  of 
treatment  could  be  taken  after  randomization.  The  applicant  has  been  mindful  of  this  concern  in 
analyzing and presenting the results; e) It was agreed that the primary analysis for the EU would be 
the per-protocol population and the period from randomization to 30 days after the last dose and the 
results would need to be consistent across the endpoints.  
During  the  current  clinical  development,  the  EMA  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal 
products for prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation  (EMA/CHMP/341363/2014)  has  been  drafted  and  came  into  effect  on  26th  December 
2014. The compliance of the pivotal study in NVAF to the available Guideline is discussed under the 
efficacy endpoints. In addition, a revision of the EMA Note for Guidance on clinical investigation of 
medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  venous  thromboembolic  disease  (CPMP/EWP/563/98)  is 
currently ongoing.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, affecting more than 
6 million people in Europe1. AF, particularly when it is persistent/permanent, predisposes patients to 
the development of atrial thrombi, which may embolize to the systemic circulation, being associated 
with a 4- to 5-fold increase in the risk of ischemic stroke and systemic embolic events (SEE)2. Vitamin 
K  antagonists  (VKA;  coumarins,  like  warfarin  and  acenocoumarol)  have  been  the  only  oral 
anticoagulants  available  over  the  last  60  years.  These  agents  are  effective  to  prevent  stroke  in 
patients with AF, but their management remains problematic due to their narrow therapeutic index 
and variability in drug exposure, necessitating routine coagulation monitoring, clinical surveillance, 
and continuous patient education3. Such monitoring is inconvenient for patients and medical staff, 
and  costly  for  healthcare  payers.  As  a  result,  approximately  only  half  of  eligible  patients  with  AF 
receive oral anticoagulation with VKA.  
Venous  thromboembolism  (VTE),  encompassing  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  and  pulmonary 
embolism  (PE),  is  the  third  leading  mortality  cause  due  to  circulatory  diseases,  only  behind  of 
myocardial infarction and stroke. Current guidelines recommend treating patients with acute VTE with 
an oral VKA for at least 3 months4. As VKA have a slow onset of action, overlapping with a parenteral 
anticoagulant  [e.g.:  low  molecular  weight  heparin  (LMWH)  or  unfractionated  heparin  (UFH)]  is 
needed for the initial 5–10 days of acute VTE, until appropriate anticoagulation with VKA is achieved 
[i.e.: international normalized ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0].  LMWH are effective and safe also for 
the  long-term  treatment  of  VTE.  However,  they  still  require  daily  parenteral  subcutaneous  (SC) 
administration,  which  may  be  problematic  for  many  patients.  On  the  other  hand,  the  VKA  have 
several limitations, as mentioned in previous paragraph.   
Direct  oral  anticoagulants  (DOAC)  are  currently  available  in  the  EU  and  other  regions  for  several 
indications, including prevention of stroke/SEE in NVAF and/or treatment of VTE: the direct thrombin 
inhibitor dabigatran (as etexilate) and the direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban. Unlike 
VKA,  these  new  compounds  exhibit  a  predictable  dose  response  and  do  not  require  routine 
coagulation monitoring, but their anticoagulant effect declines quickly in case of poor compliance and 
no widely available coagulation monitoring tests or specific antidotes are currently available5. The 
pivotal studies conducted with the DOAC in prevention of stroke/SEE in NVAF or treatment of VTE 
were mainly large non-inferiority event-driven clinical trials recruiting heterogeneous populations in 
different  geographic  regions  and  with  different  quality  of  oral  anticoagulation  with  warfarin.  The 
potential  influence  of  differences  in  clinical,  geographic  factors  and  quality  of  oral  anticoagulation 
across studies on the relative efficacy and safety of the NOAC, as well as the clinical relevance of these 
differences, may be significant, particularly in NVAF indication6. 
Edoxaban is a novel, orally active, selective, direct, reversible inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa 
(FXa). The prefix “edo” is a tribute to the old imperial city called “Edo” (now Tokyo), while the suffix 
“xaban” is the common family name of the direct factor Xa inhibitors. Factor Xa plays a pivotal role in 
the coagulation cascade because it sits at the junction of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of the 
coagulation  system.  Inhibition  of  FXa  is  exerting  anticoagulant  and  antithrombotic  effects  by 
decreasing the conversion of prothrombin to active thrombin, thereby diminishing thrombin-mediated 
activation of the coagulation process, including fibrin formation and platelet activation.

Currently,  edoxaban  is  approved  in  Japan  for  prophylaxis  of  venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  in 
subjects undergoing orthopedic surgeries and in the US to reduce the risk of  stroke and systemic 
embolism (SE) in patients with NVAF and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE).  
The CHMP granted the positive opinion for the following indications: 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 
(NVAF) with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, 
diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients). 
For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, the recommended dose is 60 mg Lixiana once 
daily.  For  the  treatment  of  VTE  including  DVT  and  PE,  and  prevention  of  recurrent  VTE,  the 
recommended dose is 60 mg Lixiana once daily following initial use of heparin. For NVAF and VTE the 
recommended dose is 30 mg Lixiana once daily in patients with one or more of the following clinical 
factors: a) moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance: 15-50 ml/min); b) low body 
weight  ≤60  kg;  c)  concomitant  use  of  the  following  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)  inhibitors:  ciclosporine, 
dronedarone, erythromycin, ketoconazole.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of edoxaban tosilate is N-(5-chloropyridin-2-yl)-N'-[(1S,2R,4S)-4 
(N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl)- 
2-(5-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine-2-carboxamido)cyclohexyl]oxamide 
mono(4-methylbenzenesulfonate) monohydrate and it has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 11/138 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The chemical structure of edoxaban tosilate has been confirmed by elemental analysis, spectroscopic 
techniques (UV, IR, 1H and 13C NMR), mass spectrometry and single X-ray structure analysis.  
The active substance is a white to pale yellowish-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder which is 
practically  insoluble  in  isopropanol  and  ethyl  acetate,  slightly  soluble  in  water,  ethanol  and 
acetonitrile, soluble in methanol and freely soluble in DMSO and N,N-dimethylformamide.  
Edoxaban  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  three  chiral  centres.  The  chirality  of 
edoxaban is determined by the synthesis of the relevant starting material and is controlled by the 
specification of this starting material. 
Edoxaban tosilate exists in two polymorphic forms, form I (thermodynamically most stable form) and 
form  II.  The  crystalline  form  consistently  produced  by  the  proposed  synthetic  route  is  form  I.  In 
addition, the results from the stability studies conducted on edoxaban tosilate show no evidence of 
conversion between form I to form II.

Edoxaban  tosilate  is  synthesized  by  two  manufacturers  in  a  three  arm  convergent  synthesis 
comprising  six  main  stages  using  well-defined  starting  materials  with  acceptable  specifications, 
followed by crystallization and milling. However, at the time of opinion the HPLC method developed to 
test one of the starting materials was not capable of identifying its oxalate counter ion. Therefore, the 
applicant is recommended to develop a specific test for the identification of the oxalate in this starting 
material.  The  stereocentres  introduced  in  this  starting  material  are  stable  to  epimerization  in 
subsequent synthetic steps. 
The particle size of edoxaban tosilate affects its dissolution and is therefore a critical quality attribute 
(CQA) of the finished product. Several design of experiments (DOEs) were conducted to determine 
the optimal crystallization process and milling conditions leading to the desired particle size 
distribution. These included the evaluation of three critical process parameters: pulverization hammer 
revolution, separator rotor revolution and flow rate. Based in these studies, proven acceptable ranges 
(PARs) were defined for these parameters. The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with 
regards to their origin and characterised. A potentially genotoxic reagent is used in the final synthetic 
step. It was stated that this reagent converts to a non-mutagenic compound under the subsequent 
acidic crystallisation conditions, and also in the acidic stomach environment when orally administered.  
However, no specific analytical method for quantification of this reagent is available. The applicant 
provided data demonstrating that the reagent is genotoxic in vitro, but not in a series of in vivo studies 
and therefore, no further in vivo mutagenicity studies are required and this reagent can be considered 
as a class 4 impurity according to ICH M7.

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are acceptable 
with the exception of potential benzene in some organic solvents. The applicant is recommended to 
develop a GC method to test potential benzene levels in ethanol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol and 
n-hexane and update their specifications if required. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identity  (IR,  RP-HPLC),  assay 
(RP-HPLC),  impurities  (RP-HPLC,  chiral  HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  water  content  (KF),  heavy 
metals (JP), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. 
Eur.). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
The method from the Japanese Pharmacopeia (JP) used for the determination of heavy metals was 
cross validated against Ph. Eur. monograph, confirming the applicability of both methods as a limit 
test method for heavy metals in edoxaban tosilate drug substance.  
Batch analysis data on fifteen pilot scale batches manufactured during the development program and 
five  commercial  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  were  provided.  The  results  were  within  the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  three  pilot  scale  batches  of  active substance  from  a  development  site  and  three 
commercial  scale  batches  from  one  of  the  proposed  manufacturers  stored  in  a  container  closure 
system representative of that intended for the market for up to 36 months (pilot scale batches) or up 
to 6 months (commercial scale batches) months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  The following parameters were tested: appearance, colour, optical rotation, identification, 
assay,  related  substances,  residual  solvents,  water  content,  particle  size  distribution,  crystallinity, 
thermal analysis and microbial purity. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and 
are stability indicating. For the additional tests performed as part of primary stability studies, which 
are not part of the release/shelf-life specification, (colour, optical rotation, some related substances, 
crystallinity, thermal analysis and microbial purity), adequate validation data have been provided. All 
results were within the proposed specification, and no differences were observed in stability behaviour 
between the pilot and the commercial scale batches. 
Forced degradation studies were performed by exposing solutions of active substance to acid, base, 
oxidant and solid samples to heat and humidity (25 ºC /33% RH, 25 ºC /93% RH, 40 ºC /75% RH), 
heat (60 ºC) or light. The results from these studies demonstrated that the active substance is stable 
to all tested conditions in the solid state but degrades in solution. 
In  addition,  one  pilot-scale  batch  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
photostability testing of new drug substances and products. The appearance of the drug substance 
remained as “white powder” following exposure to the light conditions. There was no observed change 
in the impurity profile throughout the study, specifically no new degradation products were observed 
and  no  change  enantiomeric  and  stereoisomeric  content  was  detected,  confirming  that  edoxaban 
tosilate is photostable. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The drug product is presented as film-coated, immediate-release tablets available in three strengths: 
15 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg.  
The  quality  target  product  profile  (QTPP)  was  defined  as  immediate  release  film-coated  tablets 
containing  15  mg,  30  mg  or  60  mg  of  edoxaban,  which  can  be  discriminated  visually  (by  size, 
film-coating  colour  and  debossed  information),  and  meet  compendial  and  other  relevant  quality 
standards. 
The  critical  quality  attributes  identified  were  assay,  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  dissolution, 
appearance, identity and impurities. Prior knowledge, DOE and mathematical models were applied to 
identify critical material attributes (CMAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs). 
Since edoxaban tosilate is a low solubility compound, studies were conducted to evaluate the impact 
of its particle size on the drug product dissolution rate and content uniformity. The results from these 
studies showed that the particle size of the active substance had an impact on the dissolution rate, but 
not on the content uniformity. Therefore, edoxaban tosilate particle size is reduced during the last 
step of the manufacturing process of the active substance by milling. X-ray powder diffraction studies 
confirmed that the polymorphic form I is not changed during the drug product manufacturing process. 
The selection of excipients and their target concentrations was conducted using a computer system 
that identified the initial formulation, followed by a diluent selection study, a disintegrant selection 
study and DOE to determine the final target concentration for the binder, disintegrant and lubricant 
based on their impact on dissolution performance and tablet hardness. Additionally, a compatibility 
study using binary mixtures of excipient-drug substance was performed to evaluate the stability of 
the potential formulations. Based on these studies, mannitol and pregelatinised starch were selected 
as diluents, crospovidone as disintegrant, hydroxypopyl cellulose as binder and magnesium stearate 
as lubricant. 
Optimisation  of  the  film  coating  was  next  undertaken.  Colouring  agents  were  incorporated  to 
differentiate the tablet strengths for commercial use. 
All excipients used are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The  pharmaceutical  development  was  conducted  using  Quality  by  Design  (QbD)  principles.  The 
applicant proposed some “in-house” terminology which slightly deviated from that one included in ICH 
guidelines. This is not acceptable and was clarified during the assessment process. 
In particular, according to ICH guidance, design spaces are built from CPPs and CMAs of the input 
materials.  However,  the  applicant  instead  proposed  design  spaces  for  three  drug  product  CQAs, 
(content uniformity, assay and dissolution), built from CMAs of the output materials (in this case, 
intermediates) so that they were scale independent. Since the applicant defines the design spaces 
based on CMAs of intermediates in the manufacturing process and not on input parameters, the ICH 
definition is not met. However, no regulatory flexibility in terms of process parameters as described in 
ICH Q8-Q10 was claimed.   
Prior knowledge and preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) 
risk assessments were applied to identify CMAs of the API, excipients and in-process materials, and 
the  impact  of  the  manufacturing  process  unit  operations  (granulation,  blending,  tableting  and 
film-coating) on the CQAs. PHA and FMEA risk assessments were also performed to identify the CPPs 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 14/138 
  
  
 
which need to be controlled to ensure that the CMAs remain within their target ranges, which in turn 
ensure that the CQAs of the finished product are attained.  
The design spaces were developed at pilot scale. The verification of the design space for content 
uniformity and assay was performed at commercial scale, but only with the 15 mg strength. The 
verification of the design space for dissolution was performed with all three strengths, but only at one 
third of commercial scale. Taking into account that the CMAs of the design spaces are scale 
independent the verification is considered sufficient. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that the used for marketing. 
With  regards  to  dissolution  method  development,  a  study  was  conducted  to  evaluate  which  pH 
medium had the best discriminatory capability when varying typical CMAs. The results from these 
studies demonstrated that the selected pH had adequate discriminatory capability whilst maintaining 
sink conditions.  
The  primary  packaging  is  a  PVC/aluminum  blister.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  of  Lixiana  tablets  consists  of  four  main  steps:  fluid  bed  granulation; 
blending; tableting; film-coating. The tablets are manufactured from a common granulate and are 
quantitatively proportional. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process 
As described under the pharmaceutical development section the CQAs of Lixiana tablets are ensured 
by controlling CMAs within defined design spaces. The control strategy for commercial batches uses 
process  analytical  technology  (PAT)  to  ensure  the  intermediate  CMAs  are  met.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that these CMAs act as surrogates for Lixiana CQAs which in turn allows a real time 
release  testing  (RTRT)  strategy  to  be  employed.  In  addition,  some  traditional  in-process  controls 
(IPCs) are also conducted to verify that each unit operation is carried out as planned.  
A  hybrid  approach  for  process  validation  as  described  in  the  “Guideline  on  process  validation  for 
finished  products  - 
information  and  data 
to  be  provided 
in  regulatory  submissions 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1)” has been followed. Traditional process validation 
has  been  followed  for  non-critical  manufacturing  steps,  and  a  continuous  process  verification 
approach for critical steps. A process validation scheme has been provided. To demonstrate and verify 
that the CQAs meet the specification, extensive in-line and at-line controls including PAT have been 
established.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and comprise 
appearance, identification (NIR, UV-Vis, HPLC), assay (NIR/gravimetry, HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (NIR/gravimetry,  Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  (NIR/laser 
diffraction/gravimetry/ thickness, Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), and microbial control (Ph. Eur.).  
The absence on a test for enantiomer and stereoisomers content has been adequately justified based 
on the results from the stability studies. 
The finished product is released onto the market through a combination of end product testing and 
RTRT. The strategy for RTRT has been described in detail, and verification tests against secondary 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 15/138 
  
  
 
methods have been adequately described. Parallel data comparing RTRT with equivalent end product 
release testing at commercial scale has also been provided. 
Relevant information regarding chemometric model development, data collection, model calibration, 
method  verification  and  model  maintenance  was  provided.  RTRT  has  been  established  for  all  the 
CQAs. Content uniformity, assay and dissolution would be monitored by the design spaces developed. 
Batch analysis results are provided for batches of 15 mg (8 pilot, 1 commercial scale), 30 mg (6 pilot, 
1  commercial  scale)  and  60  mg  (8  pilot,  1  commercial)  tablets  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Analytical  procedures  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated  according  to  the  ICH  QR2 
guideline  and  the  EMA  guideline  on  the  use  of  Near  Infrared  Spectroscopy  (NIRS)  by  the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of finished product of each strength stored under long term 
(25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate (30 ºC /75% RH) conditions for up to 24 months, and under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 6 months according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative of those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  related  substances,  enantiomeric  impurity, 
stereosisomer, dissolution, water content and microbial purity. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. 
Stress stability studies were also conducted on Lixiana bulk tablets for all three dosage strengths. Bulk 
tablets were stored at 60 °C in amber glass bottles closed and tested at the initial time-point and after 
1 and 2 months. Bulk tablets of all three dosage strengths were stored in an open dish at 40 °C/75% 
RH and tested after 1, 2 and 3 months.  
No  significant  changes  in  the  tested  parameters  appearance,  assay,  related  substances  and 
dissolution  were  reported  under  any  of  the  conditions  described  above.  An  increase  of  the  water 
content was observed but had no influence on the quality of the drug product. 
In  addition,  one  batch  of  each  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products showing that the product is photostable 
and no special protection from light is required. 
In order to simulate short term temperature excursions during transportation, Lixiana tablets packed 
in the primary packaging material as well as in bulk containers were stored at 60 ºC for 7 days, and 
were subjected to a temperature cycling study over a period of 12 days.  No significant changes in the 
tested parameters were observed. 
A freeze-thaw stability study on tablets stored in double aluminium blisters or aluminium/PVC blisters 
as  well  as  in  bulk  containers  was  also  conducted.  Samples  were  stored  under  thermal  cycling 
conditions for 12 days at alternating temperatures of 40 ºC (12 hours) and -20 ºC (12 hours). No 
significant changes in the tested parameters were observed, and the proposed transport conditions 
are therefore supported.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Lixiana  is  presented  as  an  immediate-release  film-coated  tablets  containing  15,  30  or  60  mg  of 
edoxaban tosilate as active substance.  Information on development, manufacture and control of the 
active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has 
applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their manufacturing process. 
Design spaces based on critical material attributes have been proposed for assay, content uniformity 
and dissolution. The design spaces have been adequately verified. The applicant has applied for Real 
Time  Release  Testing  (RTRT)  for  the  drug  product  using  Near  Infra-Red  (NIR)  method  for 
identification,  assay  and  uniformity  of  dosage  units.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
-The applicant is recommended to introduce either a IR or HPLC identification test for oxalic acid in  
the relevant starting material. 
-The applicant is recommended to develop a GC method to test potential benzene levels in ethanol, 
methanol, isopropyl alcohol and n-hexane and update their specifications. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro and in vivo primary pharmacology studies with edoxaban tosilate hydrate were conducted by 
the Applicant in order to elucidate its mechanism of action and assess its anticoagulant effect. In the 
primary pharmacology studies, inhibitory activities of edoxaban tosilate hydrate on factor Xa and the 
prothrombinase  complex  and  its  selectivity  for  factor  Xa  were  examined  in  vitro  to  elucidate  the 
mechanism of action. Edoxaban tosilate hydrate inhibited human factor Xa with a Ki value of 0.561 
nM, and it also inhibited rabbit or cynomolgus monkey factor Xa with similar Ki values of 0.457 and 
0.715 nM, respectively, whereas inhibition of rat factor Xa had an about 10-fold higher Ki value of 
6.98 nM.  
Detailed analysis of enzyme kinetics demonstrated that edoxaban tosilate hydrate is a competitive 
inhibitor  of  factor  Xa.  Although  edoxaban,  rivaroxaban  and  apixaban  have  different  chemical 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 17/138 
  
  
 
structures, X-ray analysis demonstrated that the binding sites for all three substances on factor Xa 
involve  2  distinct  sites  (S1  and  S4),  i.e.  that  the  binding  sites  for  these  substances  are  at  least 
overlapping  if  not  identical.  These  observations  might  be  of  relevance  for  the  development  of 
antagonists for factor Xa inhibitors. 
The anticoagulant effect of the product (prolongation effect on clotting time) was assessed in vitro, as 
well as the inhibition of activity of factor Xa derived from mutant factor X and the pharmacological 
activities of several metabolites. Metabolites D21-1402-0201 and D21-2135-0101 prolonged PT in 
human and rat plasma, with CT2 values similar to those of edoxaban tosilate hydrate. 
Antithrombotic effects of the drug were examined in vivo using five rat thrombosis models. In rat 
models of venous thrombosis and venous stasis thrombosis, pre-treatment with a single oral dose of 
edoxaban tosilate hydrate dose-dependently inhibited venous thrombosis and exerted anti-Xa activity 
in plasma at a minimum effective dose of 2.5 and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively, whereas the dose required 
for PT prolongation was 12.5 mg/kg. In the rat A-V shunt model, the drug inhibited thrombosis in a 
dose-dependent manner at single oral doses of 2.5 mg/kg or more, and in a rat DIC model, the drug 
showed a dose-dependent anticoagulant effect at single oral doses of 0.1 mg/kg or more, along with 
inhibition  of  platelet  consumption,  the  increase  of  thrombin-antithrombin  III  complex,  and  the 
decrease of fibrinogen. 
It is remarkable that edoxaban inhibited factor Xa activity in rats with an IC50 value of 7 nM, whereas 
much higher concentrations (in the micromolar range) were required to inhibit thrombus formation in 
rat thrombosis models. Similar observations have been made previously (Hara et al. 1995), that the 
factor Xa inhibitor DX-9065a potently inhibited human factor Xa, but that a much higher dose was 
required to inhibit thrombus formation in a rat thrombosis model. The higher potency for edoxaban 
regarding inhibition of factor Xa activity when compared to inhibition of thrombus formation in rat 
thrombosis  models  was  explained  by  the  Applicant  by  the  higher  amount  of  factor  Xa  generated 
during thrombus formation in the in vivo thrombosis models. 
Edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  was  compared  to  anticoagulant  drugs  warfarin  and  enoxaparin  in  a  rat 
model of venous thrombosis, showing that edoxaban tosilate hydrate significantly prevents venous 
thrombosis, like warfarin sodium and enoxaparin sodium, although the onset of action was more rapid 
after  treatment  with  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  than  with  warfarin  sodium  in  these  models.  In 
addition,  in  a  rat  model  of  venous  thrombosis  treatment,  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate,  enoxaparin 
sodium and fondaparinux sodium reduced the thrombus weight in a dose-dependent manner.  
In  conclusion,  orally  administered  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  has  the  potential  to  treat  venous 
thrombosis similar to warfarin, enoxaparin and fondaparinux, which have different mechanisms of 
action. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Several in vitro and in vivo secondary pharmacology studies were conducted by the Applicant. In vitro 
pharmacological activity of 10 μM edoxaban tosilate hydrate was tested on 63 receptors, channels, 
transporters and enzymes. Edoxaban showed significant affinity for histamine H2 and opioid binding 
sites, although the concentration evaluated in the study (10 μM) was about 16 times the exposure in 
patients given edoxaban at dose of 60 mg, and no clinical relevance is expected. 
In the secondary pharmacology studies conducted by the Applicant, edoxaban tosilate hydrate at 100 
μM  had  no  effect  on  aggregation  of  human  platelets  induced  by  collagen,  the  thromboxane  A2 
receptor  agonist  U46619  or  ADP.  It  inhibited  thrombin-induced  aggregation  of  human  washed 
platelets. In addition, in a rat bleeding model, edoxaban tosilate hydrate prolonged the bleeding time 
to a lesser extent than warfarin sodium and enoxaparin sodium, achieving a higher therapeutic index 
(BT2/ED50). In human plasma or whole blood, anticoagulant activities of edoxaban tosilate hydrate 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 18/138 
  
  
 
were significantly suppressed by coagulants recombinant factor VIIa, FeibaTM and PPSB®-HT. Lastly, 
in a rat plantar bleeding model, tranexamic acid did not affect the prolonged bleeding time and PT 
induced by a supratherapeutic dose of edoxaban tosilate hydrate. However, the CHMP was concerned 
whether there is progress in the development of specific antidotes which are able to antagonize the 
effects of edoxaban tosilate hydrate on blood coagulation (e.g. factor Xa mutants lacking enzymatic 
activity). This was discussed further in the clinical section (Pharmacodynamic interactions with other 
medicinal products or substances). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The potential adverse effects of edoxaban tosilate hydrate on vital functions have been investigated 
in  a  battery  of  safety  pharmacology  studies  on  the  central  nervous,  cardiovascular,  respiratory 
systems and on renal function. The highest dose of 200 mg/kg or the highest concentration of 20 
μg/mL used in these studies correspond to 200-times or 58-times, respectively, the recommended 
clinical dose of a 60 mg of edoxaban tosilate hydrate or its corresponding Cmax value of 0.347 μg/mL. 
One safety pharmacology study (Study 20020556) was performed in conscious cynomolgus monkeys 
in order to investigate the effects of edoxaban tosilate hydrate on the central nervous system, the 
respiratory system and on the cardiovascular system. In addition, one study was performed in order 
to investigate the effects of edoxaban tosilate hydrate on the central nervous system in mice, one 
study was performed in order to investigate the effects of edoxaban tosilate hydrate on renal function 
in rats, and two in-vitro studies (hERG, action potential assay in ventricular papillary muscles from 
guinea pig) were performed in order to investigate the effect of edoxaban tosilate hydrate on cardiac 
electrophysiology.  No  clinically  relevant  effects  were  observed  in  these  studies.  Edoxaban  tosilate 
hydrate at oral doses of 200 mg/kg did neither affect the function of the central nervous system of 
mice  and  monkeys,  the  respiratory  system  of  monkeys  nor  the  renal  function  of  rats.  Edoxaban 
tosilate  hydrate  at  concentrations  of  up  to  20  µg/ml  had  no  effect  on  hERG  currents  or  on  action 
potential (AP) parameters in right ventricular guinea pig papillary muscles. Edoxaban tosilate hydrate 
at  oral  doses  of  up  to  200  mg/kg  did  not  affect  blood  pressure,  heart  rate  or  ECG  parameters  in 
conscious unrestrained cynomolgus monkeys. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  nonclinical  studies  of  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  were  conducted  because  clinical 
interaction studies with aspirin, naproxen and warfarin were undertaken. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In-vivo  nonclinical  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  studies  of  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  were  performed 
primarily in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, which were also used in the toxicology studies. PK were 
evaluated using oral or intravenous doses of unlabelled or 14C-labelled edoxaban tosilate hydrate, 
which were dissolved in a solution in 0.5% methylcellulose aqueous solution. In-vitro nonclinical PK 
studies were performed with 14C-edoxaban tosilate hydrate using animal and human plasma/blood. 
For D21-2393, a human specific metabolite, the nonclinical PK studies were also performed to assess 
protein binding and tissue distribution using 14C-labeled D21-2393. 
After single oral administration of edoxaban tosilate to rats and cynomolgus monkeys, edoxaban was 
absorbed with a bioavailability of about 40% in rats and 55% in monkeys, and the plasma edoxaban 
concentration increased rapidly. After reaching Cmax, edoxaban concentration declined in a biphasic 
manner with elimination t½ of 0.67 to 5.05 h in rats and 1.55 to 6.59 h in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Repeat dosing for 2 weeks in rat and 4  weeks in  cynomolgus monkeys did not markedly increase 
edoxaban exposure, although rats treated daily with edoxaban for 4 weeks showed an increase in 
Cmax and AUC0-24h. However, according to the Applicant, in the clinical studies there is no evidence 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 19/138 
  
  
 
that  repeated  dosing  altered  the  exposure  to  edoxaban,  indicating  that  steady  state  exposure  is 
attained within 3 days in humans. 
Tissue  distribution  of  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  was  evaluated  in  albino  and  pigmented  rats  and 
cynomolgus monkeys. Edoxaban showed a broad tissue-distribution of radioactivity except for central 
nerve system in all species tested. In pigmented rats and monkeys, higher levels of radioactivity were 
found  in  the  eyeball  and  skin  than  in  other  tissues,  with  a  t½  for  radioactivity  in  the  eyeball  of 
pigmented rats of approximately 260 h. These data indicate that edoxaban and/or its metabolites 
may have an affinity to melanin-containing tissues. However, the in vitro phototoxicity studies and 
the 39-week or 52-week repeated-dose oral toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys did not show any 
photosafety issue. 
For the investigation of paediatric population, the tissue distribution of radiolabelled edoxaban tosilate 
was  studied  in  infant,  juvenile  and  adult  rats.  Infant  albino  rats  exhibited  higher  radioactivity 
concentrations  in  blood  and  tissues  than  those  in  juvenile  and  adult  rats  after  a  single  oral  dose 
of 14C-edoxaban tosilate hydrate. 
The  plasma  protein  binding  of  edoxaban  in  animals  and  humans  (31.6%-56.6%)  suggests  that 
edoxaban is unlikely to interact with other drugs via this mechanism. 
In vitro metabolism studies conducted by the Applicant are included in the clinical dossier. 
Quantitative  metabolite  profiles  of  edoxaban  in  rats  and  cynomolgus  monkeys  were  investigated 
with 14C-edoxaban label B, so the labelled position would not be released by metabolism. After an oral 
dose  of  14C-edoxaban  to  rats  and  monkeys,  unchanged  edoxaban  was  the  major  radioactive 
compound in plasma, and it was primarily excreted as unchanged in both species. These data indicate 
that metabolism makes a minor contribution to the clearance of edoxaban so that any inhibition of 
drug-metabolizing  enzymes  is  unlikely  to  affect  its  PK.  The  main  metabolite  in  human  plasma, 
D21-2393, was not detected in rat or cynomolgus monkey plasma. 
Edoxaban and its metabolites were excreted into urine, bile (tested only in rats) and faeces in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys. In rats, at least 24% of the radioactivity excreted into the bile was reabsorbed, 
suggesting that enterohepatic circulation may occur. Radioactivity was secreted into milk in rats. 
A  study  using  mdr1a/1b  knock-out  mice  showed  that  edoxaban  is  a  substrate  for  mouse  P-gp 
mdr1a/1b, which plays a role in the restricted brain uptake of edoxaban. In consistency with that, an 
in vitro transcellular transport study using Caco-2 cells demonstrated that edoxaban is a substrate of 
human P-gp MDR1. 
The tissue distribution of D21-2393, the main metabolite in human plasma, was investigated using 
infant  (PND4),  juvenile  (3  weeks  old)  and  adult  (6  weeks  old)  rats  of  albino  (male  Wistar)  and 
(male  Brown  Norway) 
rapid  elimination 
strains.  Adult 
pigmented 
of  14C-D21-2393-derived radioactivity in blood and tissues; the radioactivity concentrations in the 
blood  and  tissues  in  infant  and  juvenile  rats  were  higher  than  that  in  adult  rats.  The  remaining 
rats  exhibited 
radioactivity in the eyeball and skin observed at 24 h post-dose in infant and juvenile pigmented rats 
suggested an affinity of D21-2393 to melanin-containing tissues; however, the affinity seems to be 
less  potent  compared  to  edoxaban,  which  showed 
long  retention  of  radioactivity 
in 
melanin-containing tissues. 
The  higher  blood  and  tissue  concentrations  of  both  edoxaban  and  its  main  human  metabolite 
D21-2393 in infant and juvenile compared to adult rats have been explained by the Applicant by the 
immature  development  of  drug  metabolizing  enzymes  (cytochrome  P450  3A4  for  edoxaban)  and 
transporters  (P-glycoprotein  for  edoxaban,  organic  anion  transporting  peptides  (OATP)  and  other 
hepatic transporters for D21-2393. 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 20/138 
  
  
 
In conclusion, the nonclinical PK studies indicate that edoxaban is absorbed rapidly, has a broad tissue 
distribution with a high affinity for melanin-containing tissues and is eliminated mainly as a parent 
compound via hepatic/renal excretion and with limited metabolic elimination. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology of edoxaban tosilate hydrate has been evaluated in single- and repeated-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, genotoxicity studies, carcinogenicity studies in mice and 
rats, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, a juvenile toxicity study in 
rats,  and  other  special  toxicity  studies  including  photosafety,  ocular  toxicity  (eye  function  test), 
haemolysis  and  vascular  irritation  studies.  Potential  toxicity  of  the  human  specific  metabolite 
D21-2393  was  also  evaluated  in  repeated-dose  oral  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  in-vitro  and  in-vivo 
genotoxicity studies, embryo-fetal developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity studies in rats.  
Single dose toxicity 
In  single-dose  toxicity  studies  performed  in  rats,  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  did  not  show  toxic 
changes  at  doses  of  up  to  2000  mg/kg.  In  single-dose  toxicity  studies  performed  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys, prolongations of PT and APTT and a decrease in factor X activity were observed at doses of 
200 and 400 mg/kg, and the lethal dose of edoxaban tosilate hydrate was above 400 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In  repeated  dose  oral  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  a  small  number  of  focal  hemorrhagic  lesions  were 
observed  in  the  pancreas,  lung  and  thymus  given  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  at  doses  ≥  20 
mg/kg/day. These focal incidences were considered to be an extension of the pharmacological activity 
of edoxaban. In the 26-week repeated dose oral toxicity study in rats, the death of a female animal in 
the highest dose group was considered by the Applicant not related to the treatment. 
Since  pharmacological  activity  of  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  for  the  cynomolgus  monkey  was 
comparable to that for the human, cynomolgus monkey was considered as an appropriate species for 
toxicological assessment. In repeated dose oral toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, hemorrhagic 
findings and anaemia were noted in some animals at ≥15 mg/kg/day, leading to a deteriorated animal 
condition  or  animal  deaths.  According  to  the  Applicant,  these  findings  related  to  the  exaggerated 
pharmacological action of edoxaban tosilate hydrate are considered the primary adverse effect and 
the only dose-limiting toxicity for this compound. This conclusion was acknowledged by the CHMP.  
Intravenous toxicity studies to support a clinical study for absolute bioavailability were conducted in 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The hemorrhagic findings in these studies were consistent with the 
findings observed after oral administration. 
Genotoxicity 
A standard battery of genotoxicity tests has been perfomed with edoxaban tosilate hydrate. Although 
edoxaban tosilate hydrate caused numerical chromosome aberrations in vitro studies using Chinese 
hamster  lung  cells  and  human  lymphocytes  at  1250  μg/mL  or  more  and  313  μg/mL  or  more, 
respectively, the drug did not show any genotoxic potential in an in vitro micronucleus test using 
human lymphocytes and in three in vivo studies with different tissues (bone marrow micronucleus 
test in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, liver micronucleus test in rats, unscheduled DNA synthesis in 
rat liver).  
The doses in these in vivo studies are similar to those administered to rats in single dose toxicity 
studies and higher than those in repeated dose toxicity studies, thus, it is considered that the plasma 
exposure is sufficient. In addition, in distribution studies in rats the peak levels of radioactivity in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 21/138 
  
  
 
liver  and  bone  marrow  were  about  6  and  2  times  higher  than  in  the  plasma,  respectively.  Taken 
together, edoxaban is not considered to have a relevant in-vivo genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
The  carcinogenic  potential  of  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  was  evaluated  in  medium-term  liver 
carcinogenesis bioassay in rats, and standard 2-year mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies. The dose 
selection  and  study  design  elements  for  the  2-year  carcinogenicity  studies  in  mice  and  rats  were 
based on 13 week repeated-dose toxicity studies performed in mice and rats. 
The carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats did not reveal any increase in neoplastic effects. The 
deviation  from  GLP  in  the  rat  study  AN07-C0020-R01  (some  tissues  fixed  in  expired  modified 
Davidson’s fixative) is not considered relevant for the scientific validity of the study. In addition, the 
medium term liver carcinogenesis bioassay in rats showed that edoxaban is not associated with tumor 
promotion potential in the liver.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive toxicity studies have been performed in rats and rabbits. Edoxaban showed no effects 
on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  in  rats  at  doses  of  up  to  1000  mg/kg/day.  The 
embryo-foetal development study in rats did not reveal any malformations in the foetuses, although 
a slight increase in post-implantation loss was observed at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 49 times 
the MRHD). The study in rabbits also showed an increase in post-implantation losses, and an increase 
in the incidence of variations in the gall bladder at ≥200 mg/kg/day (approximately 65 times the 
MRHD) and increases in the incidence of 13th full ribs and 27 presacral vertebrae at 600 mg/kg/day. 
According to literature, the presence of gall bladder variations in rabbits is a species characteristic, 
and it is attributed to a paternal contribution. Regarding the incidence of 13th full ribs and 27 presacral 
vertebrae, the usefulness of these endpoints in predicting risk for the human population is complex 
and has not been well studied or validated, and it has been suggested that these findings might simply 
reflect species-specific anatomic variations, without detrimental effects on salubrity.  
In the final report of the fertility and early embryonic development study in rats (20030552) atrophy 
of the testis and epididymis was observed in several animals (1 in the control group, 1 in the 100 and 
300 mg/kg/day group and 2 in the 1000 mg/kg/day group). This finding was also detected in one 
animal  in  the  highest  dose  group  in  the  preliminary  study  20030165.  However,  literature  data 
produced both by Charles River Inc. and by other researchers show that there is a large variation of 
the testis and epididymis weights in Crj:CD(SD)IGS rats, as well as spontaneous seminiferous tubular 
atrophy, leading to atrophy of the testis and epididymis. The incidence of atrophy of the testis and 
epididymis in the fertility and early embryonic development studies in rats are comparable to that of 
the published data. 
The  margin  of  safety  at  the  NOAEL  derived  from  the  embryo-fetal  development  studies  (rats  and 
rabbits), based on the maximum recommended clinical dose of 60 mg per total body surface area in 
mg/m2, is about 16 – 19. Although no AUC data were obtained in these studies, this is not considered 
an issue because the margin of safety based on dose is appropriate. In addition, in the study in rabbits 
(2004002) the achieved Cmax is much higher than the Cmax in humans (5830 vs 347 ng/mL). 
In an oral study for effects on prenatal and postnatal development including maternal function in rats, 
vaginal bleeding in dams was observed at 30 mg/kg/day. Lower avoidance response in the shuttle box 
test was observed on the first day of examination in female offspring, but disappeared afterwards. In 
the  juvenile  toxicity  study  in  rats,  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  did  not  induce  any  toxicologically 
significant effect on postnatal development and growth, organ development, skeletal development, or 
sexual maturation. The observation that in the embryo-fetal development study pharmacodynamic 
effects occurred after 10 days, while in the fertility and development study no effects occurred after 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 22/138 
  
  
 
an even longer and higher dosing scheme has been explained by the Applicant by the timing of dosing 
during pregnancy. In conclusion, there is a potential for reproductive toxicity and an intrinsic risk of 
bleeding exists for humans. Consequently a contraindication for use during pregnancy was included in 
the SmPC.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Regarding  toxicokinetics,  some  safety  margins  are  low  (repeated  dose  toxicity  in  monkeys, 
reproductive and maternal toxicity in rats have a margin of safety based on the AUC of 1.6). However, 
this was not considered an issue because the toxicity findings are mostly produced by an exacerbated 
pharmacological effect. 
Local Tolerance  
To support a clinical study for absolute bioavailability, local tolerance of edoxaban tosilate hydrate 
lyophilized product for injection was evaluated in the in-vitro hemolysis and rabbit vascular irritation 
tests. The local tolerance studies conducted by the Applicant showed no haemolytic action on human 
blood nor irritation potential on the rabbit auricular vasculature.  
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity studies 
Phototoxicity  NRU  and  photochromosomal  aberration  tests  did  not  show  a  potential  phototoxic 
potential for edoxaban tosilate hydrate. In addition, there was no evidence of adverse effects on eye 
function  or  morphology  of  the  eye  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  after  a  39-week  repeated  dosing  of 
edoxaban tosilate hydrate at 15 mg/kg/day. 
Studies with human specific metabolite D21-2393 
The Applicant has conducted general toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity and juvenile toxicity 
studies with human specific metabolite D21-2393. The exposures achieved in all studies are much 
higher than the ones in humans treated with the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg (data from 
study DU176b-PRT019. In the general toxicity, genotoxicity, embryofoetal development and juvenile 
toxicity studies in rats no treatment related changes were noted. Regarding metabolite D21-3231, a 
study conducted by the Applicant showed that rats are exposed to D21-3231 and the potential toxicity 
of the metabolite has been assessed in the toxicity studies conducted with edoxaban tosilate hydrate. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As required by the given guidelines the applicant provided an environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
for the active ingredient edoxaban tosylate in accordance with the Guideline on environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). Since in Phase I of the 
procedure the action limit of 0.01 µg/L is exceeded, a detailed Phase II Tier A and Tier B assessment 
was  performed  to  assess  the  potential  risk  to  surface  water,  the  sewage  treatment  plant, 
water-sediment system, groundwater and micro-organisms. Laboratory studies on the environmental 
fate  and  effects  of  edoxaban  tosylate  were  conducted  following  appropriate  OECD  Guidelines  and 
under GLP conditions. On the basis of the obtained study results and the calculated PEC/PNEC values 
it can be concluded that the medicinal product Lixiana is unlikely to represent a concern for daphnids 
and  fishes.  However,  it  was  assessed  that  edoxaban  is  persistent  in  the  environment.  The 
environmental  risk  assessment  could  not  be  finalized  since  an  adsorption-desorption  study  in

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: (1) to provide an adsorption study for soils 
in accordance with OECD 106, (2) to submit a valid OECD 201 study for algae. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant conducted in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies with edoxaban tosilate to elucidate 
its mechanism of action and assess its anticoagulant effect. Edoxaban tosilate and some metabolites 
were able to prolong PT in human and rat plasma. Antithrombotic effects of edoxaban tosilate were 
examined in vivo in several rat thrombosis models, showing anti-Xa activity in plasma and thrombosis 
inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. 
Edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  was  compared  to  anticoagulant  drugs  warfarin,  enoxaparin  and 
fondaparinux in several rat models, although the mechanism of action of edoxaban is more similar to 
that of authorized new oral anticoagulants: apixaban and rivaroxaban. In these models, edoxaban 
tosilate  hydrate  significantly  prevented  venous  thrombosis,  like  warfarin  sodium  and  enoxaparin 
sodium, although the onset of action was more rapid after treatment with edoxaban tosilate hydrate 
than with warfarin. 
The safety pharmacology studies on central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and on 
renal function, did not reveal any clinically relevant effects. Several in vitro and in vivo secondary 
pharmacology studies were conducted by the Applicant. In vitro pharmacological activity of 10 μM 
edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  was  tested  on  63  receptors,  channels,  transporters  and  enzymes. 
Edoxaban  showed  significant  affinity  for  histamine  H2  and  opioid  binding  sites,  although  the 
concentration  evaluated  in  the  study  (10  μM)  was  about  16  times  the  exposure  in  patients  given 
edoxaban at dose of 60 mg, and no clinical relevance is expected. 
PK  studies  were  conducted  in  rats  and  cynomolgus  monkeys  treated  orally  or  intravenously  with 
edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate.  After  single  oral  administration  of  edoxaban  tosilate  to  rats  and 
cynomolgus monkeys, edoxaban was absorbed with a bioavailability of about 40% in rats and 55% in 
monkeys, and the plasma edoxaban concentration increased rapidly. After reaching Cmax, edoxaban 
concentration declined in a biphasic manner with elimination t½ of 0.67 to 5.05 h in rats and 1.55 to 
6.59 h in cynomolgus monkeys. Repeat dosing for 2 weeks in rat and 4 weeks in cynomolgus monkeys 
did  not  markedly  increase  edoxaban  exposure.  In  distribution  studies,  edoxaban  showed  a  broad 
tissue distribution except for central nervous system. High levels of radioactivity were found in the 
eyeball and skin in pigmented rats and monkeys, although phototoxicity and general toxicity studies 
did not show any photosafety issue.  
The main metabolite in human plasma, D21-2393, was not detected in rat or cynomolgus monkey 
plasma; therefore, specific PK and toxicity studies were conducted with this metabolite. In infant and 
juvenile rats, concentrations of both edoxaban and this main metabolite D21-2393 were much higher 
than  those  in  adults.  This  fact  was  explained  by  the  immature  development  of  drug  metabolizing 
enzymes and transporters. 
General  toxicity  studies  with  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  were  conducted  in  rats  and  cynomolgus 
monkeys. Since pharmacological activity of edoxaban tosilate hydrate for the cynomolgus monkey 
was comparable to that for the human, cynomolgus monkey was considered as an appropriate species 
for  toxicological  assessment.  In  both  species,  all  findings  were  related  to  the  exaggerated 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 26/138 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacological action of the test item, such as haemorrhagic lesions in some organs and anaemia. 
These adverse effects are considered the only dose-limiting toxicity for edoxaban tosilate hydrate. 
Regarding  toxicokinetics,  some  safety  margins  are  low  (repeated  dose  toxicity  in  monkeys, 
reproductive and maternal toxicity in rats have a margin of safety based on the AUC of 1.6). However, 
this was not considered an issue because the toxicity findings are mostly produced by an exacerbated 
pharmacological effect. 
Although edoxaban tosilate hydrate caused numerical chromosome aberrations in vitro studies using 
Chinese hamster lung cells and human lymphocytes at 1250 μg/mL or more and 313 μg/mL or more, 
respectively, the drug did  not show any genotoxic potential in an in vitro micronucleus test using 
human lymphocytes and in three in vivo studies with different tissues (bone marrow micronucleus 
test in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, liver micronucleus test in rats, unscheduled DNA synthesis in 
rat liver). In addition, in the carcinogenicity studies no increase in neoplastic effects was found. 
The  embryo-foetal  development  study  in  rats  did  not  reveal  any  malformations  in  the  foetuses, 
although a slight increase in post-implantation loss was observed at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 
49 times the MRHD). The study in rabbits showed an increase in post-implantation losses, and an 
increase in the incidence of variations in the gall bladder at ≥200 mg/kg/day (approximately 65 times 
the  MRHD)  and  increases  in  the  incidence  of  13th  full  ribs  and  27  presacral  vertebrae  at  600 
mg/kg/day. However, the presence of gall bladder variations in rabbits is a species characteristic, and 
it is attributed to a paternal contribution. Regarding the incidence of 13th full ribs and 27 presacral 
vertebrae, the usefulness of these endpoints in predicting risk for the human population is complex 
and has not been well studied or validated, and it has been suggested that these findings might simply 
reflect species-specific anatomic variations, without detrimental effects on salubrity.  
In  the  juvenile  toxicity  study  in  rats,  edoxaban  tosilate  hydrate  did  not  induce  any  toxicologically 
significant effect on postnatal development and growth, organ development, skeletal development, or 
sexual maturation. 
The Applicant has conducted general toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity and juvenile toxicity 
studies with human specific metabolite D21-2393. No treatment related changes were noted.  
The environmental risk assessment could not be finalized because two studies were still not available.  
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
A PIP was agreed for edoxaban tosilate hydrate (EMEA-000788-PIP02-11-M02). The Applicant has 
conducted all the non-clinical studies required in the PIP, both with edoxaban tosilate hydrate and 
with metabolite D21-2393. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of edoxaban tosilate hydrate 
are  well  characterized  and  the  non-clinical  package  presented  by  the  Applicant  is  considered 
appropriate. However, the environmental risk assessment could not be finalized because two studies 
were still not available (see List of Recommendations).

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This submission includes 43 clinical pharmacology studies to characterise the PK and PD profile of 
edoxaban, while the efficacy and safety in each of the two requested indications is mainly based on

Analytical Methods 
Statement on GLP compliance and bio-analytical audits is given. 
The validation reports included all validation parameters for full validation of an analytical method 
according to the FDA Guideline for “Industry, Bioanalytical Method Validation stability. In general, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 35/138 
  
  
 
 
 
 
pre-study validations of all the bioanalytical methods were consistent and demonstrated an adequate 
precision  and  accuracy  (both  intra-  and  inter-day)  within  the  calibrated  range,  which  showed  an 
adequate  selectivity,  matrix  effect  and  carry-over,  although  in  June  2011,  the  MHRA  conducted 
inspections at the Rushden (UK) laboratory of Quotient and identified irregularities in some of the 
bioanalytical data. Details of the specific data irregularities identified the affected bioanalytical and 
clinical studies, and the comprehensive remediation undertaken, are summarized in a Remediation 
Report (TMBA001). In addition, all amendments were reviewed by GLP or GCP inspectors prior to 
being sent to the study sponsor. At the end of this process the applicant was satisfied that all relevant 
data had been assessed and a risk assessment had been carried out which showed minimal impact on 
study conclusions. 
Dilution of samples was necessary (different dilution factors have been validated). 
The established long-term stability at -20 °C for all analytes (including analytes in the DDI studies) 
covers  the  maximum  period  of  study  sample  storage  with  the  following  exception:  for  ENGAGE 
AF-TIMI 48 study (U301), PK samples from subjects were analyzed and reported, even though the 
collection-to-analysis time could have exceeded validated long-term storage stability period (up to 
793 days under -20 ºC, longer storage time not tested).  
In general, the analysis of study samples is acceptable and the re-analysis of the study samples were 
well justified and handled, although some samples reanalysis were carried due to PK reason. For the 
PK re-assayed, the original values have been reported in the most cases. For the other, the mean 
concentration  was  reported.  It  could  be  acceptable  take  into  account  that  these  samples  do  not 
correspond to values near tmax and it is not a BE study. 
All results for ISR samples were within the 20% acceptance limits, although not in all studies the ISR 
was  performed  (for  BE  study  the  ISR  has  been  performed).  This  is  acceptable  as  the  ISR  was 
performed in others studies using the same analytical methods in the same analytical site. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  edoxaban  has  low  solubility  and  low  permeability  and  is  classified  as  Biopharmaceutics 
Classification  System  (BCS)  Class  IV.  The  formulation  strategy  focused  on  developing  an  oral 
immediate-release tablet. The proposed commercial formulations are 15, 30, and 60 mg tablets. The 
15 and 30 mg tablets were used in the Phase 3 pivotal studies and are the same as the commercial 
tablets except for a change in the colouring agent. The 60 mg tablet has been demonstrated to be 
bioequivalent to 2 x 30 mg tablets (U142). The bioequivalence of the 15 mg tablets was not tested in 
vivo,  but  is  assumed  as  the  criteria  regarding  manufacture  process,  qualitative  composition,  ratio 
between  amounts  of  active  substance  and  excipients  and  the  comparative  dissolution  profiles  are 
fulfilled  according  to  section  4.1.6  of  the  EMA  Guideline  on  the  investigation  of  bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). 
Absorption  
Site of absorption 
Edoxaban is absorbed with peak plasma concentrations within 1 - 2 hours. The absolute bioavailability 
is  approximately  62%.  Edoxaban  is  primarily  absorbed  (approximately  85%)  in  the  upper 
gastrointestinal tract and is poorly soluble at pH of 6.0 or higher. Compared with oral administration 
of edoxaban tablets, exposure to edoxaban following delivery in the distal small bowel was about 15% 
and in the ascending colon about 7%. Administering the compound as a liquid (thus eliminating the 
limitation of pH dependent solubility) or with an acid (fumaric acid; to reduce pH below 6.0 and thus 
maximize  solubility)  did  not  greatly  improve  the  absorption  from  the  ascending  colon.  Thus,  in 
subjects with achlorhydria or conditions and concomitant drugs that increase stomach pH higher than

6,  edoxaban  solubility  and  dissolution  rate  may  be  reduced,  thereby  affecting  total  absorption  of 
edoxaban.  
Bioavailability 
The proposed commercial formulations for the 15 mg and 30 mg tablets have the same composition 
as the Phase 3 tablets, with the exception of the colorants used in the film coats. Additionally, a 60 mg 
tablet has been developed for commercial use. 
The bioavailability of edoxaban was evaluated in four studies (PRT001, U145, U139 and U147) and is 
described below.

Oral administration of a 60 mg dose to a fasting subject results in peak plasma concentrations of 
309±97 ng/mL (arithmetic mean±standard deviation [SD]) occurring within 1 to 2 h (study U151); 
this Cmax was slightly higher on average than after the same dose in study U147.  
The absolute bioavailability of edoxaban is about 62% (geometric mean, study U139). 
Under  fasting  conditions,  the  relative  bioavailability  of  edoxaban  from  a  tablet  formulation  (white 
uncoated tablet) is almost 100% with respect to a solution (study PRT 001). 
The PK profile of edoxaban is similar for single and multiple dosing (study PRT 001). Steady-state is 
achieved  within  3  days  of  dosing,  with  minimal  accumulation  upon  once  daily  dosing  (less  than 
2-fold). At steady-state, a 60 mg dose results in peak concentrations of 303±88 ng/mL at median 
(range) 1.5 h (0.5 to 4.00 h). The steady-state exposure is 1990±403 ng•h/mL (AUCtau) with trough 
concentrations of 15.5±3.98 ng/mL (study U151). At the 60 mg bid dose level, the pre-dose and 4 
hours post-dose concentrations after the evening dose on Day 9 were similar to after the morning 
dose, suggesting no diurnal variation in the pharmacokinetics of DU-176. 
Influence of food 
The effect of food on the rate and extent of exposure of single doses of edoxaban has been examined 
in several studies. In the pivotal food effect study (study U148) administration of a high-fat meal did 
not significantly affect the total exposure of edoxaban (approx. 10%; upper bound 90% CI<125% of 
fasted from the 60 mg tablets; however, the maximum concentration (Cmax) of edoxaban increased by 
40%, when dosed with a high-fat meal. In general, a variable food effect (4% to 77% increase) was 
observed in Cmax, but no significant effect was seen on total exposure. The high-fat meal also delayed 
the  time  to  peak  concentration  by  about  0.5h;  however,  in  the  pivotal  Phase  3  clinical  studies 
edoxaban was dosed without regards to food as the observed PK differences were not expected to 
have a significant impact on PD of edoxaban. Therefore no recommendation is made for edoxaban to 
be taken with or without food.

Effect of gastric pH 
The effect of gastric pH on edoxaban pharmacokinetics was evaluated in a drug-interaction study with 
esomeprazole  40  mg  QD,  which  elevates  the  mean  24-hour  gastric  pH  to  4.33.  Single  dose 
administration of oral 60 mg edoxaban 2 hours after the fifth dose of esomeprazole 40 mg QD resulted 
in a 33% decrease in peak concentrations of edoxaban, with 90% CI falling below the 80 to 125% 
limit, and the total exposure decreased by 12% with 90% CI completely within the 80 to 125% limit 
(study U156).  
Distribution 
Distribution of edoxaban appears to be biphasic, probably due to enterohepatic circulation, with a 
steady-state volume of distribution of 107±19.9 L (study U139). While the intravenous (IV) half-life 
is  about  7  h  (U139),  the  oral  half-life  is  between  10  to  14  h,  suggesting  a  higher  terminal  phase 
volume  (Vz).  This  indicates  that  the  gut  distribution  and  redistribution  phases  contributing  to  Vz 
following  oral  administration  result  in  a  longer  oral  apparent  half-life  which  could  be  due  to 
enterohepatic  recirculation.  The  inter-  and  intra-subject  variability  for  clearance  and  volume  of 
distribution of edoxaban is low (<30%). In vitro plasma protein binding was approximately 54-57% 
(study 20040272). In addition, plasma protein binding of edoxaban was measured at 2 h, 6 h and 12 
h after a single dose of 90 mg and 120 mg of edoxaban (study PRT001). At the 90-mg and 120-mg 
doses, the plasma protein binding ranged from 40% to 59%, and remained relatively constant over 
time and individual values at 2 hours post-dose ranged between approximately 37 to 59% across the 
two dose levels. 
Elimination 
The elimination of endoxaban includes both renal and non-renal pathways. In healthy volunteers both 
pathways  contribute  equally  (~50%)  to  the  total  clearance  of  edoxaban  after  iv  dosing  (U139). 
Edoxaban is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine and through biliary secretion (PRT019); with 
metabolism contributing to a lesser extent towards total clearance of edoxaban. In healthy subjects, 
edoxaban  is  the  predominant  excreted  component  in  urine,  accounting  for  35%  (range  27.4%  to 
46%) of the administered dose indicating that the renal excretion is a significant component of the 
total clearance. The renal clearance for total radioactivity was 9.69 ± 0.997 L/h, which is higher than 
glomerular  filtration  rate  suggesting  active  secretion  in  kidney.  In  feces,  62%  (range  55.2%  to 
73.0%) total radioactivity is detected; 49% of the administered dose appears to be as parent drug. As 
the  absolute  bioavailability  is  approximately  61.8%  (Study  U139).  Therefore  the  unchanged 
edoxaban detected in the feces was a result of both unabsorbed drug and hepatobiliary excretion of 
systemically absorbed drug. The total clearance of edoxaban is 21.8±3.03 L/h and the renal clearance 
of edoxaban was 14.2 ± 3.4 L7H. An in vitro uptake study in suspended fresh human hepatocytes 
provides  suggests  that  edoxaban  is  not  a  substrate  for  the  OATP  class  of  uptake  transporters, 
including OATP1B3. 
Metabolism 
Unchanged  edoxaban  is  the  predominant  form  in  plasma.  Edoxaban  is  metabolised  via  hydrolysis 
(mediated  by  carboxylesterase 1),  conjugation  or  oxidation  by  CYP3A4/5  (< 10%).  A  total  of  7 
metabolites have been detected in plasma; 3 have anticoagulant activity (D21-2393 [human specific 
metabolite],  D21-1402,  D21-2135).  In  healthy  subjects,  D21-2393  (M4)  is  the  most  abundant 
metabolite (approximately 10% of parent drug exposure), followed by D21-3231 (< 10%), D21-1402 
(<5%),  and  D21-2135  (low  amounts).  D21-1402,  D21-2135,  D21-2393  and  edoxaban  inhibited 
human FXa with IC50 values of 6.9, 2.7, 1.8 and 3.0 nM, respectively. 
The  amount  of  total  metabolites  detected  in  urine  and  feces  was  approximately  5  and  4%, 
respectively, indicating further metabolism of these metabolites and/or small volumes of distribution 
Assessment report

corresponding  to  higher  plasma  concentrations  relative  to  those  in  urine  and  feces.  Overall, 
metabolism appears to play a modest role in the elimination of edoxaban.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Based on the studies submitted, the increases in peak and total exposures were slightly less than dose 
proportional  between  15  and  60  mg  but  this  lack  of  dose  proportionality  was  not  considered  of 
relevant  magnitude.  Hence 
it  can  be  concluded  that  edoxaban  displays  approximately 
dose-proportional pharmacokinetics for doses of 15 mg to 60 mg in healthy subjects. Population PK 
modelling (TMPP014) of pooled Phase 1 data from 5 studies, for doses of 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 
and  180  mg  indicates  a  slightly  less  than  dose-proportional  dose-exposure  relationship.  The 
population estimate of F1 (model-based relative bioavailability) was found to remain constant for the 
dose range of 10 mg to 30 mg, but decreased with increasing doses at higher dose levels. For doses 
above 30 mg, every 30-mg increase in dose was associated with a 6.7% decrease in F1, presumably 
due to a decreased dissolution rate. 
In study PRT001, the PK profile of edoxaban is similar for single and multiple dosing. Steady-state is 
achieved  within  3  days  of  dosing,  with  minimal  accumulation  upon  once  daily  dosing  (less  than 
2-fold). The mean accumulation ratio at steady-state for maximum (peak) concentration (Cmax) is 
1.07 and for area under the concentration-versus-time curves AUCtau (over tau, the dosing interval of 
24 h), is 1.14. At the 60 mg bid dose level, the pre-dose and 4 hours post-dose concentrations after 
the evening dose on Day 9 were similar to after the morning dose, suggesting no diurnal variation in 
the pharmacokinetics of DU-176.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In study PRT001 it was stated, that inter-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban was 
low  for  AUC0-∞  and  moderate  for  Cmax.  Similar  variability  was  assumed  for  the  intra-subject 
variability.  The  inter-  and  intra-subject  variability  for  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  of 
edoxaban is low (<30%). 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Population PKs indicates very similar PK of edoxaban in healthy subjects and in patients. The PopPK 
simulations did not indicate clinically relevant differences. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Results  from  a  targeted  study  in  renal  impairment  show  that  edoxaban  AUC0-inf  increased  by 
approximately 32%, 74% and 72% in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment but 
not  on  dialysis,  respectively,  compared  to  healthy  subjects.  Edoxaban  AUC0-inf  increased  by 
approximately  93%  in  subjects  with  ESRD  on  peritoneal  dialysis.  A  study  in  ESRD  patients  on 
intermittent hemodialysis suggests that hemodialysis does not significantly remove edoxaban from 
the blood. The PopPK modelling based on data from the Phase 3 study in AF showed that AUC0-24,ss  
increase  on  average  by  25%,  57%  and  97%  in  subjects  with  mild,  moderate  and  severe  renal 
impairment.  The following posology is recommended in the proposed SPC: subjects with normal renal 
function and mild renal impairment (CrCL > 50 mL/min) are recommended to receive edoxaban doses 
of  60  mg  once  daily,  while  for  subjects  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  (CrCL  15-50 
mL/min) a 50% dose reduction is recommended. In patients with ESRD (CrCL <15 mL/min) or on 
dialysis, the use of edoxaban is not recommended. Based on the results from the renal impairment 
study  and  the  PopPK  modelling  based  on  data  from  the  Phase  3  study  in  AF  the  dosing 
recommendations in renal impairment seem adequate. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015

The targeted phase I study in patients with hepatic impairment suggest that administering a single 
dose of 15 mg of edoxaban to subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and 
B) is unlikely to affect edoxaban exposure to a clinically relevant extent. Subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment  have  not  been  studied.  It  should  be  however  noted  that  15  mg  is  not  the  proposed 
therapeutic dose (60 mg). Therefore definitive conclusions regarding the need for dose adjustment in 
subjects with hepatic impairment can not be concluded from this study. The following posology in 
hepatic impairment is recommended in the proposed SPC: No dose adjustment is proposed in patients 
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and edoxaban is not recommended in patients with severe 
hepatic  impairment.  Edoxaban  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  hepatic  disease  associated  with 
coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk. 
Weight 
The effect of body weight has been evaluated using Population PK analyses. Allometrically scaled body 
weight was included on all disposition parameters for edoxaban in the Population PK analyses based 
on phase I data, characterizing an increase in disposition parameters with increasing body weight. In 
the phase 2 study C-J225 Japanese subjects with body weight ≤ 60 kg treated with edoxaban had 
higher  incidence  of  bleeding  than  those  with  body  weight  >60  kg.  Therefore,  it  was  decided  that 
patients with low body weight ≤ 60 kg would receive half of the dose in the phase 3 studies. The 
population  PK  analysis  based  on  data  from  the  phase  3  study  in  AF  shows  that  total  exposure  is 
predicted to be 13% higher and peak exposure is predicted to be approximately 40% higher in  a 
typical non-asian patient with normal renal function weighing 55 kg with respect to a patient weighing 
84  kg.  With  the  proposed  dosing,  subjects  weighing  <  60  kg  seems  under  exposed  compared  to 
subjects > 60 kg (almost half exposure). Despite lower exposures, the Applicant has shown that both 
the ENGAGE AF and Hokusai VTE studies did not reveal any clinically relevant increases in stroke/SEE 
event rates relative to warfarin for subjects randomized to a reduced dose of edoxaban due to body 
weight ≤ 60 kg.  Furthermore, predicted PK data in different body weight groups show that the 25th to 
75th percentiles from the subgroups ≤ 60 kg, ≤ 50 kg and ≤ 40 kg overlap. It worth mentioning that 
the majority of the target population in standard clinical practice will have in addition some degree of 
impairment  in  renal  function  and  associated  risk  factors  for  bleeding.  Therefore,  in  the  low 
body-weight population, the main concern is bleeding due to potential overexposure rather than a 
potential lack of efficacy. Therefore the Applicant's conclusion not to change the weight cut off for 
dose adjustment is accepted. . For 60 mg QD the plasma concentrations of edoxaban in patients with 
Body weight > 140 kg in relation to all patients in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 was reduced to ~60% for Cmax, 
~65% for AUC0-24,ss and ~70% for Cmin. A weak trend to a reduced efficacy of edoxaban 60 mg OD 
versus warfarin in heavy patients weighing >100 kg is visible (stroke/SEE, HR: 1.12; 95%CI: 0.70 to 
1.78; mITT, overall study period) compared with patients weighing ≤ 100 kg (stroke/SEE, HR: 0.83; 
95%CI: 0.70 to 0.98; mITT, overall study period). However, the HR in heavy patients is based on a 
small  number  of  primary  events  (38  vs  33)  and  the  efficacy  of  edoxaban  60  mg  compared  with 
warfarin appears to be maintained even in heavy patients (interaction p-value = 0.24). 
Gender and Age 
Regarding gender and age, a phase I study was performed to assess the PK profiles of edoxaban in 
healthy females and healthy elderly males. Although it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions 
from this study due to the reduced sample size, edoxaban pharmacokinetics does not appear to be 
markedly affected by gender, when differences in body weight are taken into account. Regarding age, 
the small increase in AUC and the decrease in clearance observed in this study in elderly males are 
probably  due  to  the  decrease  in  renal  function  with  age.  The  effect  of  gender  has  been  further 
evaluated using population PK analyses. After accounting for body weight, gender does not appear to 
have a relevant effect on edoxaban PK. Thus, no dose modification is proposed based on gender. The 
effect of age has also been further evaluated using PK data from pivotal studies and from Population 
PK analyses. These analyses suggest that, after accounting for renal function, age does not have a 
Assessment report

clinically  significant  effect  on  edoxaban  PK.  The  analyses  were  consistent  in  the  subgroups  65-74 
years, 75-84 years and older than 85 years. As such, no dose reduction is recommended based upon 
age alone.  
Race 
There  are  very  limited  data  originating  from  phase  I  /  PK  studies.  Japanese  and  Caucasian  male 
subjects  were  examined  in  the  studies  PRT020  and  PRT008.  Additional  information  is  provided  in 
PopPK-analyses/modelling. PK is sufficiently characterised for Caucasian subjects. Minor differences 
to Japanese subjects are considered of no clinical relevance. Descriptive PK-data provided for races 
other than Caucasians or Japanese from pivotal trials suggest that race has no significant impact on 
the edoxaban exposure.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effects of other substances on edoxaban: 
The  potential  for  other  drugs  to  affect  edoxaban  exposure  seems  to  be  primarily  related  to  the 
inhibition  of  P-gp.  In  vivo  DDI  studies  with  drugs  known  to  inhibit  P-gp  have  been  conducted. 
Ketoconazole,  ciclosporine,  quinidine,  verapamil,  erythromycin  and  dronedarone,  increased 
edoxaban AUC by 87%, 73%, 77%, 53%, 85% and 85%, respectively. Cmax increased by 89%, 74%, 
85%, 53%, 68% and 46%. Based on these results, a 50% dose reduction was initially recommended 
by the Applicant when edoxaban is co-administered with P-gp inhibitors. However, in respect to the 
clinical efficacy and safety data gained with verapamil or amiodarone comedication (see Discussion on 
Clinical Pharmacology) and the similarity of the influence of verapamil, amiodarone and quinidine on 
edoxaban PK, it is considered appropriate to administer edoxaban at a dose of 60 mg once daily when 
these drugs are a concomitant medication unless additional factors such as impaired renal function or 
low body weight have to be taken into account. 
An in vivo study with the P-gp inducer rifampicin showed that edoxaban AUC decreased by 34% and 
Cmax  was  comparable.  In  spite  of  the  decrease  in  edoxaban  total  extent  of  exposure,  the 
pharmacodynamic  effect  was  not  significantly  influenced  by  the  co-administration  with  rifampicin. 
This  finding  is  likely  due  to  the  observed  increase  in  the  total  exposure  to  active  metabolites 
D21-2393 and D21-1402, which can be explained by the OATP1B1 inhibition and by the strong CYP3A 
induction produced by rifampicin. Based on these results, no dose modification is proposed by the 
Applicant when edoxaban is administered with rifampicin. 
Effects of edoxaban on other substances: 
Enzyme inhibition potential has been studied in vitro and the results suggest that a clinically relevant 
inhibition by edoxaban of the CYP enzymes most commonly involved in drug metabolism is not likely. 
Predictions  based  on  the  PBPK  model  suggest  that  a  clinically  relevant  drug-drug  interaction  via 
edoxaban  CYP3A4  induction  is  unlikely.  A  in  vitro  study  was  considered  negative  for  CYP2B6 
induction. 
Regarding  inhibition  of  efflux  transport  proteins,  edoxaban  effect  on  P-gp  mediated  transport  of 
digoxin has been investigated. The results in vitro show that the net flux ratio of digoxin decreases 
with increased concentrations of edoxaban. However, results from an in vivo study with digoxin show 
that a clinically relevant effect of edoxaban on the PK of digoxin is not likely.   
Results of the AM14-C0053-R01 “in vitro” study showed no effect of edoxaban on BCRP transport.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Edoxaban is a highly selective, direct and reversible inhibitor of factor Xa, the serine protease located 
in  the  final  common  pathway  of  the  coagulation  cascade.  Edoxaban  inhibits  free  factor  Xa,  and 
prothrombinase  activity.  Inhibition  of  factor  Xa  in  the  coagulation  cascade  reduces  thrombin 
generation, prolongs clotting time and reduces the risk of thrombus formation. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In vitro, edoxaban inhibits the human FXa in a concentration-dependent and competitive manner. In 
human studies, it has rapid onset of action with anticoagulant effects, as measured by biomarkers 
such  as  Factor  Xa  activity,  thrombin  generation  (TG)  parameters,  prothrombin  time  (PT)  and 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), observed soon after first dose administration.  
Inhibition of FXa in the coagulation cascade reduces thrombin generation and prolongs clotting time 
and  reduces  thrombus  formation.  The  inhibitory  effects  of  edoxaban  on  human  FXa  and 
prothrombinase complex were evaluated in several studies. Anticoagulant activity of edoxaban was 
measured in human plasma through activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time 
(PT), expressed as International Normalised Ratio (INR), and thrombin time (TT). 
The biomarkers measured during clinical development include D-dimer, anti-FXa activity, PT, aPTT, 
Intrinsic FX activity, prothrombin fragments F1 and F2 (F1+2), prothrombinase-induced clotting time 
(PiCT), thrombin generation, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) and β-thromboglobulin (β-TG). 
PT  and  aPTT  were  measured  in  most  of  the  clinical  pharmacology  studies  as  part  of  PD  or  safety 
assessment. Additional biomarkers were measured in specific clinical pharmacology studies to further 
characterize the PD effects of edoxaban.  
The  PD  biomarkers  of  edoxaban  have  been  characterized  in  many  Phase  1  clinical  pharmacology 
studies  from  healthy  subjects  (PRT001,  PRT003,  PRT005,  PRT009)  to  characterize  the  biological 
effects of edoxaban. 
Edoxaban has a concentration dependent response on PT, aPTT, anti-FXa, TGA, D-dimer and F1+2. 
PRT001: In this randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled two part study, single ascending doses 
(SAD) of 10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, 120 mg, and 150 mg of edoxaban were administered to 85 
healthy  adult  males  aged  18-51  years  to  evaluate  the  PK  and  PD  of  edoxaban  (PRT001-SAD  and 
PRT001-MAD). In part two of the study, 36 healthy male subjects received 90 mg QD, 60 mg BID, or 
120  mg  QD  for  10  days.  Single  oral  doses  of  edoxaban  from  10  mg  to  150  mg  resulted  in  rapid 
increase in anti-FXa activity and rapid prolongation of PT and aPTT. 
For all dose levels, the median time at which maximal activity was observed was between 1.0 to 3.0 
h  postdose.  On  average,  maximum  observed  activity  for  PT,  aPTT  and  anti-FXa  increased  in  a 
dose-dependent  manner  over  the  dose  range  studied.  Recovery  to  predose  values  was 
dose-dependent with return to baseline by 24 to 36 h postdose in all subjects.

PRT003:An  open  label,  randomised,  placebo  and  positive  controlled  (Fondaparinux).  The  primary 
objective of this study was to investigate the effect of administration of different doses (30, 60 and 
120 mg) of oral edoxaban on inhibition of thrombin generation and platelet activation by using the 
shed  blood  model.  Edoxaban  caused  a  rapid  and  marked  reduction  in  the  thrombin  generation 
markers,  F1+2  and  TAT  in  shed  blood,  at  dose  levels  of  30  to  120  mg.  The  maximum  inhibition 
appeared  to  be  reached  at  the  120  mg  dose  level.  There  was  no  apparent  drug-related  effect  of 
edoxaban on venous F1+2 levels, and edoxaban  caused a rapid and variable reduction in venous TAT 
levels at dose levels of 30 to 120 mg. High between-subject variability in venous F1+2 and TAT data 
confounded  the  interpretation.  Edoxaban  caused  a  rapid  and  marked  reduction  in  the  marker  of 
platelet activation, â-TG in shed blood, at dose levels of 30 to 120 mg. The between-subject variability 
in  venous  â-TG  data  was  high  for  edoxaban.  Edoxaban  caused  a  rapid  and  marked  dose-related 
prolongation  of  the  venous  blood  coagulation  parameters,  APTT,  PT  and  PT-INR,  and  induction  of 
venous Anti FXa activity at dose levels of 30 to 120 mg. There was no apparent drug-related effect of 
edoxaban on shed blood volume. Furthermore, high between-subject variability was observed. 
PRT005:an open label, single center, assessor blind, ex vivo study. The primary objective of this 
study was to investigate the antithrombotic effects following a single oral dose of 60 mg edoxaban 
using a human model of thrombus formation. The secondary objective of the study was to analyze the 
pharmacological effects of edoxaban using thrombin generation measurement, anti-factor Xa activity, 
and standard coagulation parameters (PT/INR and aPTT). Pharmacological effects were assessed in 
relation to plasma concentrations of edosaban at time 0 (pre-dosing), 1.5, 5 and 12 h (post-dosing). 
Edoxaban  60  mg  oral  dose  reduced  ex  vivo  thrombus  formation  under  high-and  low  shear  rate 
conditions, prolonged clotting time in subjects´ plasma, and inhibited clotting factor Xa. 
PRT009 and PRT018: Two studies investigated both, QD and BID dosing (study PRT009 in elderly 
healthy  subjects  and  study  PRT018  in  patients  with  NVAF).  In  both  studies  through  levels  of 
pharmacodyamic parameters (especially anti-FXa activity) were markedly higher after BID dosing. 
Therefore, the effect on pharmacodynamic parameters does not seem to be maintained throughout 
the dosing interval after QD dosing, at least at the 30 mg dose level. Overall, the low anticoagulant 
action after about 12 hours after QD dosing has to be discussed in the clinical context, also taking into 
account the higher bleeding rates with BID dosing. 
TMCP-Peds-001  (DSNER1): This study tested the effect on plasma biomarkers of coagulation of 
ex-vivo  treatment  with  edoxaban  (6  concentrations:  12.5,  25,  50,  100,  200  and  500  ng/ml)  and 
rivaroxaban (5 concentrations: 12, 36, 108, 216 and 540 ng/ml) using blood samples from umbilical

cord (n=10) and healthy adult volunteers (n=5). The PD performance of edoxaban in plasma from 
ex-vivo-treated cord blood was not significantly different from that in plasma from ex-vivo-treated 
adult blood for any parameter investigated, which included Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial 
thromboplastin  time  (aPTT),  Anti-Factor  Xa  (Anti-FXa),  Intrinsic  Factor  X  (Intrinsic  FX)  Thrombin 
Generating Activity (TGA): Peak (TGA-Peak); lag time (TGA-lag), time to peak (TGA-time to peak), 
endogenous thrombin potential (TGA-ETP) and velocity index (TGA-VI). In summary, there was no 
significant  difference  in  the  anticoagulant  activity  of  edoxaban  in  cord  and  adult  plasma.  In  an 
addendum  to  this  study,  it  was  reported  that  the  percentage  increase  of  INR  following  ex-vivo 
treatment with edoxaban did not differ significantly in samples derived from adult versus cord blood 
treated. 
Secondary pharmacology 
PRT021: A phase 1, randomized, single-dose, placebo and active controlled crossover (moxifloxacin 
400 mg) study to evaluate a thorough QTC study with edoxaban in healthy subjects. 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  effect  of  therapeutic  and  supratherapeutic 
plasma exposures of edoxaban on the QTc interval duration after administration of single oral doses 
of  90  mg  and  180  mg.  Blood  was  collected  for  the  determination  of  plasma  concentrations  for 
edoxaban for up to 48 hours post-dose in each period. The primary endpoint for this study was the 
time-matched  difference  in  QTcI  (individual  correction  method)  interval  of  each  active  treatment 
group  (edoxaban  90  mg,  edoxaban  180  mg  dose,  and  moxifloxacin)  and  placebo  after  baseline 
adjustment.  The  main  objective  of  the  QTc  analysis  was  to  determine  whether  edoxaban  has  a 
threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization, as detected by QT/QTc prolongation.  
Since the positive control (moxifloxacin) met the criteria for the QTc prolongation of greater than 5 
msec at the specified time points, the thorough QTc study is valid to detect conclusively the potential 
edoxaban to cause changes in ∆QTcI intervals.  Edoxaban did not have a threshold pharmacologic 
effect on cardiac repolarization. The upper bounds of 95% one-sided CIs for the least-squares mean 
of the placebo-corrected QTcI change from time-matched baseline did not exceed 4 msec at any time 
point  after  dosing  for  either  dose  level  (90  mg  and  180  mg).  The  results  showed  no  relationship 
between plasma concentrations of edoxaban and ∆QTcI values up to DU-176b concentrations of 857 
ng/mL. 
In summary, doses of edoxaban had no clinically relevant QTc effect as compared to placebo, and this 
can be considered a negative thorough QT/QTc study. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In  healthy  volunteers:  In  study  PRT001,  A  linear  correlation  was  observed  between  edoxaban 
plasma concentrations and PT, aPTT and anti-FXa activity (Figure 2.1).

In  patients:  There  are  two  Phase  3  pivotal  studies  of  efficacy  and  safety,  one  of  them  in  NVAF 
(ENGAGE-AF) and the other one in patients with VTE (Hokusai-VTE), in which plasma samples were 
obtained and therefore a relationship between plasma and efficacy/safety could be tempted. The first 
substudy (TMPP009) describes the plasma exposure response of edoxaban and efficacy (time to first 
occurrence of stroke or SEE, ischemic stroke or SEE and hemorrhagic stroke) and safety endpoints 
(time to first occurrence of major bleeding) (Figures PD-02 and PD-03). This substudy demonstrated 
statistically significant exposure response relationships using a median model prediction for major 
bleeding (minimum concentration), stroke or SEE (average concentrations), and ischemic stroke or 
SEE  (average  concentration),  but  not  for  hemorrhagic  stroke.  By  appliying  a  logistic  regression 
model,  the  period  of  time  that  intrinsic  factor  Xa  was  maintained  at  15%  or  less  was  the  most 
significant factor for bleeding. As such, the duration of factor FXa suppression exceeding a certain 
threshold value seems to be more accountable for bleeding risk than the magnitude of suppression. 
This may explain the observed increase in bleeding after the 30 mg and 60 mg BID dosing regimens 
compared to QD dosing of edoxaban in phase II trials.

Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
As  an  anticoagulant,  edoxaban  has  the  potential  to  interact  with  other  drugs  that  influence  the 
coagulation  system.  Co-administration  of  edoxaban  with  acetylsalicylic  acid,  naproxen,  or  digoxin 
showed additive effects on bleeding time prolongation compared to the administration of edoxaban 
alone, without additionally affecting platelet aggregation.   
The interaction studies with aspirin (high and low doses), naproxen or digoxinare:  
PRT014:A  phase  I,  randomized,  open-label,  dual  sequence,  parallel  group  study  assessing  the 
pharmacodynamic effects  of the co-administration of digoxin and edoxaban in healthy volunteers. 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of  multiple  daily  60  mg 
edoxaban doses for seven days followed by its co-administration with multiple 0.25 mg digoxin dose 
for the subsequent seven days. lood samples for PD parameters, were collected over 24 hours on Day 
7 (monotherapy) and on Day 14 (combination therapy). Maximal increases in coagulation parameters 
were  noted  at  approximately  2  hours  after  the  last  dose  following  concomitant  administration  of 
edoxaban and digoxin. The maximum decrease in the rate of thrombin generation and the maximum 
anti-factor Xa activity occurred 2 hours after the last dose. PT, INR, aPTT, all CAT-TGT parameters, 
and  anti-factor  Xa  (FXa)  activity  were  summarized  with  descriptive  statistics.  The  combination 
therapy of digoxin and edoxaban increased the maximal plasma concentration of digoxin by 28% and 
increased the maximal plasma concentration of edoxaban by 16%, without affecting the total extent 
of exposure. The combination therapy (edoxaban and digoxin) and the monotherapy with edoxaban 
resulted  in  a  similar  increase  of  the  standard  coagulation  parameters  (INR,  PT  and  aPTT).  The 
thrombin  generation  was  slightly  decreased,  and  the  induction  of  anti-factor  Xa  activity  slightly 
increased. A strong positive correlation was observed between plasma concentrations of edoxaban 
and  anti-Factor  Xa  activity.  These  results  were  not  unexpected  based  on  previous  non-clinical 
pharmacology studies that showed edoxaban to be a potent and direct inhibitor of Factor Xa (FXa) 
that prolongs clotting  (PT and aPTT) in plasma. 
U128: A phase I, open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover study to assess the effect of naproxen on 
the  pharmacodynamics  of  edoxaban.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  effect  of 
co-administration of naproxen (500 mg BID) and edoxaban (60 mg) on bleeding time, and on global 
coagulation  variables  (aPTT,  PT/INR,  and  Intrinsic  Factor  Xa),  compared  to  when  each  drug  was 
administered  alone.  Serial  blood  samples  were  collected  on  Day  1  at  pre-dose  (baseline  for  each 
respective period) and on Day 2, measured at various time points up to 24 hours postdose. 
Bleeding Time: Both edoxaban and naproxen had an effect on prolongation of bleeding time was most 
pronounced when both drugs were administered together. 
Pharmacodynamic  Markers:  Graphical  data  analysis  demonstrated  correlations  between  the  peak 
plasma concentrations of edoxaban, administered with or without naproxen, and PT, INR, aPTT and 
Intrinsic  FXa.  Similar  prolongation  effects  from  baseline  were  observed  for  the  coagulation 
biomarkers PT, INR, aPTT and Intrinsic FXa, measured at various time points up to 24 hours postdose 
on Day 2, when edoxaban was administered with or without naproxen. The prolongation effect of 
edoxaban  on  the  coagulation  biomarkers  PT,  INR,  aPTT  and  Intrinsic  FXa  was  not  significantly 
influenced by co-administration with naproxen.

PRT017: A phase I, two-cohort, double-blind, randomized, 2-way crossover study in healthy subjects 
to assess the effect of high dose aspirin on pharmacodynamics of edoxaban. The objectives of this 
study were to assess the effect of co-administration of high dose aspirin (325 mg) and edoxaban (60 
mg) on bleeding time, and the effect of co-administration of aspirin on the pharmacodynamics (PD) 
edoxaban. Serial blood samples were collected on Day 1 (baseline) and on predose on Day 5 until 24 
hours post dose. 
Bleeding Time: These results showed that both edoxaban and high dose aspirin have an effect on 
prolongation of bleeding time was generally most pronounced when both drugs were administered 
together. Results for changes in bleeding time from baseline were consistent with an additive effect 
for the prolongation of bleeding time between edoxaban and aspirin. 
Pharmacodynamics:  The  effects  of  edoxaban  and  aspirin  (administered  alone or  as  a  combination 
therapy)  on  coagulation  were  measured  using  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT), 
prothrombin time (PT), anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity, prothrombinase induced clotting time (PiCT), 
and  calibrated  automated  thrombogram-thrombin  generation  time  (CAT-TGT)  for  thrombin 
generation. In all treatments that included edoxaban either as a monotherapy or as a combination 
therapy  with  aspirin,  similar  increases  from  baseline  were  noted  for  most  coagulation  parameters 
following dose administration on Day 5. The pharmacodynamics of edoxaban do not appear to be 
influenced by the co-administration of aspirin. 
U127:A phase I, randomized, 3-way crossover, open-label study in healthy subjects to assess the 
effect of low dose aspirin on pharmacodynamics of edoxaban. The objectives of this study were to 
assess the effect of co-administration of low dose aspirin (100 mg) and edoxaban (60 mg) on bleeding 
time,  and  the  effect  of  co-administration  of  aspirin  on  PT,  aPTT,  INR  and  anti-FXa  activity  of 
edoxaban. Serial blood samples were collected on Day 1 (baseline) and measured at various time 
points up to 24 hours post-dose on Day 5, when edoxaban was administered with or without aspirin. 
Bleeding  Time:  concomitant  administration  of  100  mg  aspirin  and  edoxaban  results  in  greater 
prolongation of bleeding time, comparing with either drug administered alone. Results for changes in 
bleeding time from baseline were consistent with an additive effect for the prolongation of bleeding 
time between edoxaban and aspirin. 
Pharmacodynamics:  PD  analyses  were  performed 
in  order  to  determine  the  effect  of 
co-administration of edoxaban and low dose aspirin on the coagulation parameters aPTT (Time), aPTT 
(Ratio),  PT  (Time),  PT  Rate  (%),  INR  and  Intrinsic  FXa.  No  significant  difference  was  observed  in 
coagulation effects when edoxaban was administered with low dose aspirin (Treatment A) compared 
to its administration alone (Treatment B). Aspirin had no apparent effect on coagulation biomarkers 
after 5 days of once daily doses of 100 mg. These results were consistent with the similar prolongation 
effects observed relative to baseline, based on the peak change and percent change from baseline 
results, for both treatments. These results supported the hypothesis that the effect of edoxaban on 
the coagulation biomarkers would not be significantly influenced by co-administration with aspirin. 
The  effect  of  edoxaban  on  the  coagulation  biomarkers  PT,  INR,  aPTT  and  Intrinsic  FXa  was  not 
significantly influenced by co-administration with aspirin. 
Effects of coagulation markers when switching from rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or apixaban 
to edoxaban: 
U122:A phase I, randomized, double blind study to assess the pharmacodynamics of edoxaban in 
healthy  subjects  who  have  recently  discontinued  warfarin.  The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to

determine the effect of warfarin on biomarkers of anticoagulation in healthy subjects who were dosed 
to  achieve  an  INR  of  2  to  3,  and  to  compare  the  effect  of  edoxaban  to  placebo  on  biomarkers  of 
anticoagulation in healthy subjects who have recently discontinued warfarin. Serial blood samples for 
PD markers were collected at baseline (predose on Day 1) and from predose up to 12 hours post dose 
on the last day of warfarin dosing (prior to administration of edoxaban or placebo). The administration 
of a  single edoxaban 60  mg dose 24 hours after the last warfarin dose prolonged the lag time to 
thrombin  formation  or  clotting  time.  A  positive  correlation  was  observed  between  plasma 
concentrations of edoxaban and clotting time as measured by the clotting time factors PT, INR and 
PICT. A strong positive correlation was observed between plasma concentrations of edoxaban and 
anti Factor Xa activity. 
U151:A  phase  I,  open-label,  randomized,  crossover  study  to  assess  the  pharmacodynamics 
edoxaban (60 mg) in healthy subjects after switching from dabigatran (150 mg BID) or rivaroxaban 
(20 mg). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated 
partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT)  profile  in  healthy  subjects  treated  with  edoxaban  alone  or 
preceded by rivaroxaban or dabigatran, and to assess the effect of edoxaban alone or preceded by 
rivaroxaban  and  dabigatran  on  additional  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  assays.  PD  assessments  were 
based on the following biomarkers: PT, aPTT, anti-FXa, TGA parameters, bleeding time, and ecarin 
clotting time (ECT). Serial blood samples were collected during each treatment edoxaban switching 
on  Day  4,  and  also  during  treatment  edoxaban  only  on  Day  1,  for  assessment  of  PD  parameters 
related to edoxaban. The  PD parameters for PT, aPTT, anti-Fxa,  ETP peak thrombin after a single 
edoxaban dose preceded by rivaroxaban were comparable to those parameters after 4 consecutive 
daily doses of edoxaban. The PD parameters for anti-FXa, ETP, peak thrombin after a single edoxaban 
dose preceded by dabigatran were comparable to those parameters after four consecutive daily doses 
of  edoxaban,  but  for  PT  was  higher.  Switching  from  rivaroxaban  to  edoxaban  24  h  after  the  last 
rivaroxaban dose resulted in similar anticoagulant effects of edoxaban in all PD assays upon switching 
as  upon  multiple  dosing  of  edoxaban.  Switching  from  dabigatran  to  edoxaban  resulted  in  higher 
anticoagulant  effects  of  edoxaban  for  aPTT,  PT,  and  the  thrombin  generation  parameters  most 
sensitive to dabigatran (TGA lag time, TGA time to peak) when dosed 12 h after a dabigatran dose. 
E152: A phase I, open-label, 2-treatment, 2-way crossover study to assess the pharmacodynamics 
edoxaban (60 mg) in healthy subjects after switching from apixaban (5 mg BID). The objectives of 
this study were to evaluate the prothrombin time (PT) in healthy volunteers treated with edoxaban 
alone or preceded by apixaban, and to assess the effect of edoxaban alone or preceded by apixaban 
on  additional  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  assays:  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT), 
anti-factor  Xa  (anti-FXa)  activity,  thrombin  generation  assay  (TGA)  parameters.  The  prothrombin 
time  (PT)  observed  for  apixaban  BID  followed  by  edoxaban  was  comparable  to  that  observed  for 
edoxaban alone on day 4. The other biomarkers anti-FXa, INR, ETP, peak thrombin after edoxaban 
were  comparable  across  study  days  in  Treatment  edoxaban  alone  (Days  1  and  4)  and  across 
treatments  switching  from  apixaban.  Switching  from  apixaban  to edoxaban  at  the  next  scheduled 
dosing time of apixaban should be feasible, as anticoagulant effects of edoxaban upon switching are 
similar to multiple dosing of edoxaban. 
Reversal of anticoagulant effects 
Study U150 investigated the potential of two concentrations of a 3-factor PCC (factors FII, IX and X) 
as reversal agents  for edoxaban. Both doses of edoxaban (60 and 180 mg) inhibited endogenous 
thrombin potential (ETP, one of the TGA parameters), an effect that was rapidly reversed (within 0.5 
h  after  administration  of  PCC)  by  both  doses  of  PCC  (25  and  50  IU/kg).  The  effect  was  more 
pronounced for the 60 mg dose group. At 0.5 h after administration of PCC, the LSM values for change

from baseline for TGA-ETP were -1047, -546 and -611, respectively for 60 mg edoxaban dose alone, 
or edoxaban with 25 or 50 IU/kg PCC. For the 180 mg edoxaban dose, the change from baseline in 
TGA-ETP was -1644, -975 and - 1970, respectively with edoxaban alone, or edoxaban with 25 or 50 
IU/kg PCC. Both doses of PCC resulted in a more rapid return to baseline for both doses of edoxaban 
(~3h),  than  for  edoxaban  alone  (>72h).  However,  PCC  did  not  substantially  reverse  the  effect  of 
edoxaban on PT, INR or aPTT prolongation relative to placebo. Both doses of PCC did not appear to 
have any effect on change from baseline for anti-FXa.  
Hence,  administration  of  25  or  50  IU/kg  3-factor  PCC  with  edoxaban  60  or  180  mg  did  not 
substantially accelerate reversal of PT, INR or aPTT prolongation relative to placebo. A reversal was 
demonstrated for ETP. No dose-dependency with respect to the effect on ETP (between 25 IU/ kg and 
50 IU/ kg) was observed.  
Genetic differences in PD response 
Exploratory  pharmacogenomics  analyses  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  demonstrable  effect  of 
VKORC1 or CYP2C9 genotype on bleeding events in edoxaban treated subjects, although in warfarin 
treated  subjects,  theVKORC1  1639  AA  subjects  appeared  to  have  a  higher  frequency  ofbleeding 
events that the GG or GA genotypes. Common genetic variants in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes that 
are known to affect warfarin sensitivity had no effect on bleeding in subjects treated with edoxaban. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
A large amount of PK data was generated, as PK-data were not only available from the 43 phase 1 
studies but from phase 2 and phase 3 studies as well. In general, PK was considered characterised 
properly. This includes absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME), influence of food 
and gastric pH, renal and hepatic insufficiency.  
Time dependency of edoxaban PK in general was characterised properly. There is a bi-exponential 
decline of the plasma profile. The half-life estimates were variable across studies. A pooled population 
PK (PopPK) analysis of 8 Phase 1, 1 Phase 2 and 2 Phase 3 studies of edoxaban characterized the PK 
of edoxaban using a two-compartment model, giving an estimated half-life of about 12.5 h. In some 
studies, sparse sampling after 12 hours may have led to a shorter calculated half-life (e.g. t1/2 = 5.5 
– 7.5 h in study U147). When edoxaban is dosed 60 mg QD, Cmax is about 20 - fold the value of Ctrough. 
As  a  linear  correlation  is  observed  between  edoxaban  plasma  concentrations  and  PT,  aPTT,  and 
anti-FXa activity the QD dosing was considered not justified from the PK point of view. A BID or even 
three  times  a  day  (TID)  dosing  scheme  could  be  more  favourable.  The  chosen  QD-dosing  was 
addressed as well in the PD, clinical efficacy and safety sections of this assessment report. 
The targeted phase I study in patients with hepatic impairment suggested that administering a single 
dose of 15 mg of edoxaban to subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and 
B)  is  unlikely  to  affect  edoxaban  exposure  to  a  clinically  relevant  extent.  In  light  of  the  results 
obtained in this study and considering the importance of renal clearance in edoxaban elimination, the 
Applicant's  conclusion  regarding  no  need  for  dose  adjustment  in  subjects  with  mild  or  moderate 
hepatic impairment was considered acceptable.  
In general, the PK interactions profile is characterised properly. Though amiodarone and verapamil 
show comparable modifications of edoxaban PK, a dose reduction of edoxaban by 50 % was initially 
suggested  if  co-administered  with  verapamil  but  not  when  co-administered  with  amiodarone,  a 
decision mainly based on Cmin calculations. However, clinical phase III data indicate that efficacy of

quinidine. In ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, subgroup analyses for these patients indicated a numerically better 
efficacy of warfarin. The concern is supported by the POP PK analyses. C min ss values were 28.13 
ng/ml (n = 10272) for the 60 mg qd dose and 16.24 ng/ml (n = 335) for the 30 mg qd dose in the 
presence of a P-gp inhibitor. In respect to the clinical efficacy and safety data gained with verapamil 
or  amiodarone  co-medication  and  the  similarity  of  the  influence  of  verapamil,  amiodarone  and 
quinidine on edoxaban PK, it was considered appropriate to administer edoxaban at a dose of 60 mg 
once daily when these drugs are a concomitant medication unless additional factors such as impaired 
renal function or low body weight have to be taken into account. The SmPC section 4.5 was modified 
accordingly.  Co-administration  of  edoxaban  with  the  p-gp  inducer  rifampicin  led  to  a  decrease  in 
mean edoxaban AUC and a shortened half-life, with possible decreases in its PD effects. Therefore, 
edoxaban should be used with caution when co-administered with P-gp inducers.  
Population pharmacokinetics 
In general, the population PK analysis was considered acceptable. Presented goodness of fit plots was 
not  easy  to  interpret  since  scaling  was  not  optimal.  Prediction-corrected  Visual  Predictive  Checks 
(pcVPCs)  were  considered  acceptable  and  bootstrap  (n=100)  results  show  good  agreement. 
Compared to the results of the non-compartmental analysis (NCA), clearance was underestimated in 
the normal renal function group and overestimated in the severely renally impaired group. This might 
indicate an underprediction of the influence of CrCl on edoxaban clearance (CL). Edoxaban seems to 
undergo an enterohepatic recirculation. A second peak can be seen in the concentration-time profiles. 
The second peak was more pronounced in patients with mild or moderate renal function compared to 
those with normal or severe renal function. The model seems to underestimate the influence of renal 
function since compared to NCA values which ranged from 34.8 to 17.9 L/h from normal to severe 
renal function; the final model only predicted a range between 31.4 and 20.5 L/h.  
Influence  of  P-gp  inhibitors  was  discussed  with  the  Phase  1  POPPK  model.  It  was  mentioned  that 
taking into account the relation of each P-gp inhibitor separately was more adequate than including a 
class effect of P-gp inhibitors. In the Phase 3 POPPK model, P-gp inhibitors were introduced as a class 
and the effect on absolute bioavailability (F) and CL remains unclear. A more differentiated conclusion 
on the necessity of dose adjustment and its extent with the different P-gp inhibitors was not possible 
with the actual data. The following recommendations were finaly agreed to be included in the SmPC 
with regards to the concomitant use of edoxaban and P-gp inhibitors: (1) in patients concomitantly 
taking  edoxaban  and  the  following  P-gp  inhibitors:  ciclosporine,  dronedarone,  erythromycin,  or 
ketoconazole,  the  recommended  dose  was  agreed  to  be  30  mg  of  edoxaban  once  daily  (50% 
reduction as compared to the usual recommended edoxaban dose of 60 mg once daily); (2) no dose 
reduction was recommended for concomitant use of amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil; (3) the use 
of Lixiana with other P-gp inhibitors including HIV protease inhibitors has not been studied. The effect 
of P-gp inhibitors, pre-specified for dose-adjustment on the PK of edoxaban, differed to the effect of 
P-gp inhibitors with no dose-adjustment on the PK of edoxaban. The applicant considered the slight 
non-proportionality  of  the  PK  of  edoxaban  not  relevant  for  a  different  influence  of  different  P-gp 
inhibitors on edoxaban exposure, especially because dose reduction was only done by 50% and not 
from 60 mg to 15 mg.  
Eta-shrinkage values were high in the Phase 3 studies. This has to be kept in mind when evaluating 
the  exposure  –  response  relation  since  estimated  exposure  values  for  individual  persons  will  be 
shrunk  to  the  typical  population  parameters.  Thus,  the  variability  in  the  exposure  will  not  be 
adequately captured, but will be lower than real.

Summarizing the results of the population PK analyses, the relevance of the influence of concomitant 
P-gp inhibitors could not be finally assessed.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The effect of edoxaban on anti-Xa activity was assessed in multiple clinical trials. The PD effects of 
edoxaban  include  induction  of  venous  anti-FXa  activity  at  dose  levels  of  30  to  120  mg,  the 
prolongation of clotting tests such as PT/INR, and aPTT, as well as edoxaban 60 mg reduced ex vivo 
thrombus formation. Edoxaban has no apparent direct effect on platelet activation or on endothelial 
activation. 
A  linear  correlation  was  observed  between  edoxaban  plasma  concentrations  and  PT,  aPTT  and 
anti-FXa activity in healthy subjects (study PRT001). In patients with NVAF, there was a statistically 
significant  exposure  response  relationship  for  major  bleeding  (minimum  concentration),  stroke  or 
SEE  (average  concentrations),  and  ischemic  stroke  or  SEE  (minimum  concentration),  but  not  for 
hemorrhagic  stroke  (TMPP009).  In  patients  with  acute  VTE,  there  was  a  statistically  significant 
exposure  response  relationship  for  recurrent  VTE  (average  concentration),  but  no  statistically 
significant exposure response relationship was detected for CRB (TMPP011). 
As  an  anticoagulant,  edoxaban  has  the  potential  to  interact  with  other  drugs  that  influence  the 
coagulation  system.  Co-administration  of  edoxaban  with  acetylsalicylic  acid,  naproxen,  or  digoxin 
showed additive effects on bleeding time prolongation compared to the administration of edoxaban 
alone, without additionally affecting platelet aggregation. The prolongation effect of edoxaban on the 
coagulation  biomarkers  PT,  INR,  aPTT  and  intrinsic  FXa  was  not  significantly  influenced  by 
co-administration with these drugs. 
Available data support that edoxaban does not affect the QTc interval: the lower bound of the 95% CI 
for the placebo-adjusted change in QTc after treatment with moxifloxacin was >5 msec, confirming 
assay  sensitivity.  The  upper  bound  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  placebo-adjusted  differences  for  both 
edoxaban doses were < 4 msec, indicating that edoxaban had no relevant effect on the QTc interval.  
The effect on PD parameters seems not to be maintained throughout the dosing interval after QD 
dosing (e. g. study PRT003). Two studies investigated both, QD and BID dosing (study PRT009 in 
elderly healthy subjects and study PRT018 in patients with NVAF, please refer to clinical part of this 
AR). In both studies through levels for PD parameters (especially anti-FXa activity) were markedly 
higher after BID dosing. Overall, the low anticoagulant action beyond 12 hours after QD dosing has to 
be discussed in the clinical context, also taking into account the higher bleeding rates with BID dosing. 
Overall, the choice of the QD dosing regimen is considered justified with regard to the increase in 
bleeding risk observed after BID dosing. The impact of lower doses than 30 mg BID, which might have 
exhibited the most favourable B/R profile, cannot be assessed since such doses were not investigated. 
Further discussion on this issue was not considered necessary given the clinical study data available.  
PD interaction studies have been performed with edoxaban and digoxin, naproxen and low- and high- 
dose ASA. The results from these studies did not reveal any unexpected PD interactions. Adequate 
warnings  were  included  in  the  SmPC  with  respect  to  co-administration  of  agents  with 
anti-haemostatic properties (e. g. naproxen). The present wording recommends against the chronic 
concomitant use of naproxen but permits short term treatment, which is acceptable. Since high dose 
ASA (325 mg) increased the steady state Cmax and AUC of edoxaban by 35% and 32%, respectively, 
and was not permitted in the phase III trials, the wording in section 4.5 has been amended as follows: 
"“The  concomitant  chronic  use  of  high  dose  ASA  (325  mg)  with  edoxaban  is  not  recommended. 
Concomitant  administration  of  higher  doses  than  100  mg  ASA  should  be  only  performed  under 
medical supervision”.

Switching from various anticoagulants to edoxaban was examined in healthy subject studies, trough 
effects  on  PD  markers  of  coagulation.  Based  on  the  study  results,  switching  from  enoxaparin, 
warfarin,  rivaroxaban  and  apixaban  can  be  initiated  at  the  next  scheduled  dosing  time  of  the 
preceding anticoagulant. The proposal to start warfarin when the INR is <2.5 was accepted. Switching 
from the factor II inhibitor (dabigatran) to edoxaban is recommended at the next scheduled dosing 
time of dabigatran (12 h after the last dose of dabigatran). Switching from dabigatran to edoxaban 
resulted in higher anticoagulant effect of edoxaban as evidenced by aPTT when dosed 12 hours after 
dabigatran dose (this effect normalized at about 24 hours). Section 5.1 of the SmPC was updated to 
reflect  that  when  switching  from  dabigatran  to  edoxaban  in  clinical  pharmacology  studies,  higher 
aPTT activity was observed after edoxaban administration with prior dabigatran treatment compared 
to that after treatment with edoxaban alone. This was considered to be due to the carry-over effect of 
dabigatran treatment, however, this did not lead to a prolongation of bleeding time. 
Development of the reversal agent for edoxaban 
Study U150 investigated the potential of two concentrations of a 3-factor PCC (factors FII, IX and X) 
as a reversal agent for edoxaban. This study showed differential effects on PT prolongation, anti-FXa 
(no reversal) and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) (reversal). No dose-dependency with respect 
to the effect on ETP (between 25 IU/ kg and 50 IU/ kg) was observed. Furthermore, unlike warfarin, 
it is unclear which biomarker correlates best with clinical anticoagulation status and bleeding.  
Overall, further investigations on other potential reversal agents and biomarkers for monitoring are 
considered necessary. Study U158 was a 2-part study, that was performed in healthy subjects to 
assess  the  use  of  a  punch-biopsy  to  evaluate  edoxaban  effects  on  bleeding  (Part  1),  and  then  to 
evaluate the reversal effects of a 4-factor PCC (Part 2). Results of study U158 are promising in that a 
4- factor PCC (licensed in the EU) could be useful to reverse the anticoagulant effect of edoxaban. 
PER977 is a small, synthetic molecule designed to bind to factor Xa inhibitors (edoxaban, rivaroxaban 
and apixaban) and to the oral thrombin inhibitor dabigatran through non-covalent hydrogen bonding 
and charge-charge interactions. Study PER977 was a first in human study which assessed the safety 
and the effect on anticoagulation reversal of PER977 when administered alone and after a 60 mg dose 
of the factor X inhibitor edoxaban. Results from this phase 1 study are also promising. Two phase 2 
studies,  investigating  the  reversal  of  anticoagulant  effect  of  edoxaban  with:  (1)  aripazine  (CSR 
planned for July 2015) and (2) andexanet alfa (sponsored by another company, supported by the 
applicant),  are  currently  underway.  All  studies  are  included  in  the  agreed  RMP.  Overall,  the 
development program for a reversal agent was considered comprehensive. 
Polymorphisms in the genes associated with the determinants of PD (variants in the VKORC1 and 
CYP2C9 genes), that are known to affect warfarin sensitivity had no effect on bleeding in subjects 
treated with edoxaban. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  PK  properties  of  edoxaban  have  been  generally  well  characterised.  Regarding  interaction  of 
edoxaban with other drugs, the overall PK, efficacy and safety data indicates that a dose-adjustment 
of edoxaban 60 mg is not required when coadministered with verapamil, quinidine or amiodarone.  
The PD properties of edoxaban are adequately characterized and are within expected for a direct FXa 
inhibitor.  Overall,  the  development  program  for  a  reversal  agent  was  considered  reasonable  and 
comprehensive and has to be followed as specified in the agreed RMP.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
A total of 6 phase-II studies (3 controlled and 2 uncontrolled studies) were conducted in patients with 
NVAF. Overall, the studies included 2045 patients receiving at least one dose of study drug (safety 
population). Of them, 1595 were treated with several oral dosing regimes of edoxaban, ranging from 
5 mg OD to 60 mg BID, and 450 patients received warfarin as active control. The Phase 2 studies in 
subjects with NVAF were not designed to evaluate efficacy; they were safety studies of short term 
treatment (up to 3 months) and relatively small sample size, with the exception of study PRT-018 
(n=1146), which is described below. 
Study PRT-018: A Phase 2, randomized, parallel group, multi-center, multi-national study 
for the evaluation of safety of four fixed dose regimens of DU-176b in subjects with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation  
Study Period: First subject first visit date: 02 Jul 2007; Last subject last follow-up date: 10 Jun 2008 
Study Center(s): A total of 107 investigative sites randomized subjects in this study. This study was 
conducted  (randomized  subjects)  at  23  investigative  sites  in  North  and  South  America,  18 
investigative sites in Eastern, Western, and Central Europe, 32 investigative sites in Russia, and 34 
investigative sites in Ukraine. 
Phase of Development: Phase 2 
Study objectives: The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of four fixed dose regimens of 
DU-176b (30 mg once daily [qd], 30 mg twice daily [bid], 60 mg qd, and 60 mg bid) in subjects with 
non-valvular  atrial  fibrillation  (NVAF).  Warfarin  was  included  as  an  active  control.  Evaluation  of 
bleeding  events  and  liver  enzyme/bilirubin  abnormalities  were  the  primary  focus  of  the  safety 
evaluation. 
Secondary objectives included the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Evaluation of the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE): stroke (ischemic or 
hemorrhagic),  SEE,  myocardial  infarction  (MI),  cardiovascular  death,  and  hospitalization  for 
any cardiac condition 
Evaluation  of  the  effects  on  biomarkers  of  thrombus  formation:  D-dimer  and  prothrombin 
fragments 1 and 2 (F1 and F2). 
Evaluation of the PK of DU 176 including known metabolites in subjects receiving DU-176b. 
Evaluation  of  the  effects  on  PD  biomarkers  (anti  FXa  activity,  endogenous  FXa  activity, 
prothombin time [PT], international normalized ratio [INR], prothrombinase induced clotting 
time [PiCT], and thrombin generation using the calibrated automated thrombogram [CAT-TG]) 
in subjects receiving DU-176b. 
Study  Design/Methodology:  This  was  a  randomized,  double-blind  (DU-176b)  and  open-label 
(warfarin),  parallel  group,  multi-center,  multi-national  study.  Male  and  female  subjects,  18  to  85 
years of age, inclusive, with NVAF and at least a moderate yearly risk of stroke (based on the CHADS2 
index  score)  were  randomly  assigned  to  1  of  5  treatment  groups  (4  fixed  doses  of  DU-176b  or 
warfarin) in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. The Investigator, all subjects, and the Sponsor were blinded to the 
exact DU-176b dose regimen, but not to whether the assigned treatment was DU-176b or warfarin. 
Subjects randomized into the study received 1 of the following active treatments: DU-176b 30 mg qd; 
DU-176b 30 mg bid;DU-176b 60 mg qd; DU-176b 60 mg bid (only subjects randomized before 14 Jan 
2008); Warfarin tablets (open-label) qd with dose adjusted to maintain an INR between 2.0 and 3.0, 
inclusive. Treatments were administered for 3 months (see figure below).

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) of external experts was organized to monitor the 
study data in an unblinded manner while the study was ongoing. The purpose of the IDMC was to 
protect the safety of the subjects and to advise the Sponsor in case of any signals of safety concern. 
In  addition,  an  independent  Clinical  Events  Committee  (CEC)  was  organized  to  evaluate  and 
adjudicate all bleeding events based upon review of blinded data. The CEC adjudicated all bleeding 
events  and  categorized  them  as  major,  clinically  relevant  nonmajor,  or  minor  bleeding  based  on 
pre-specified definitions. 
Table E02. Disposition of subjects in study PRT-018 
Results:  
A total of 1146 patients were enrolled. Of them 1143 patients received at least one dose of study drug 
(safety population). The mean age ranged from 64.7 to 66.0 years. The mean weight ranged from 
87.75  kg  to  88.95  kg.  Most  subjects  were  male  (~60%).  Most  of  the  subjects  (~60%)  were 
warfarin-naïve and approximately half of the subjects were on aspirin therapy at study entry. The 
majority  of  subjects  were  Caucasian  (~98.0%)  and  from  Eastern  Europe  (over  90%).  Across  all 
treatment groups, ~36% of subjects had a CHADS2 score ≥ 3, ~20% of subjects had diabetes, ~95% 
of subjects had hypertension, ~65% of subjects had ischemic heart disease, ~90% of subjects had 
heart failure, and ~20% had a past stroke or TIA. 
Major  Adverse  Cardiovascular  Events  (Efficacy):  The  incidence  of  MACE  was  2.4%  for 
warfarin-treated subjects and 2.5% across all DU-176b treated subjects.  
Safety: Overall, DU-176b 30 mg qd and 60 mg qd dosage regimens were well tolerated with lower or 
similar  incidences  of  bleeding  compared  with  warfarin  therapy  (see  table).  Subjects  treated  with 
DU-30 mg bid and 60 mg bid regimens had higher bleeding incidences compared with subjects on 
warfarin therapy. The DU-176b 60 mg bid regimen was considered unsafe by the IDMC due to an 
unfavourable benefit/risk ratio, and was terminated early. Subjects treated with DU-176b 30 mg qd

and 60 mg qd regimens had lower bleeding incidences than those treated with the 30 mg bid or 60 mg 
bid regimens. 
Table E03. Bleeding events in study PRT-018 
The overall incidence of liver enzyme and bilirubin abnormalities was low in this study and there was 
no significant difference between treatment groups.  
Table E04. Liver abnormalities in study PRT-018 
There  were  two  subjects  (Subject  IDs:  20060002  and  40290006  [1  in  each  of  the  DU-176b  bid 
groups]) who experienced concomitant but not persistent elevations of ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN and TBL 
≥ 2 x ULN. At the same time as the elevated ALT/AST and TBL, both subjects also had ALP > 2 x ULN, 
suggesting  cholestasis  rather  than  drug-induced  hepatocellular  injury.  Independent  hepatologists’ 
review of these cases concluded that one subject had acute cholecystitis and the other had a dilated 
bile duct confounded by chronic heart failure, intermittent hypotension, and anemia. 
Deaths: Fourteen subjects (6 [2.6%] in the 30 mg qd DU-176b group, 4 [1.6%] in the30 mg bid 
DU-176b group, 1 [0.4%] in the 60 mg qd DU-176b group, 0 in the 60 mg bid DU-176b group, and 3 
[1.2%] in the warfarin group) died during the study: 8 deaths occurred while the subject was on study 
drug, 5 occurred as a results of events during the post-treatment follow-up period, and 1 occurred 
during the follow-up period as a result of an event that began the day after the last dose of study drug 
(i.e., on the last day of the treatment period). All deaths resulted from cardiovascular conditions such 
as MI, coronary artery disease, cardiac failure, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or sudden death.  
PK:  The  pharmacometric  analyses  were  conducted  to  better  understand  the  PK  across  the  study 
population,  the  relationship  between  PK  parameters  and  bleeding  incidence  relationship  and  the 
differences  in  bleeding  incidences  (DU-176b  bid  regimens  vs.  DU-176b  qd  regimens).  These 
pharmacometric analyses confirmed similar total exposure expressed as AUCss between the DU-176b 
Assessment report

60 mg qd and 30 mg bid regimens. In addition, logistic regression analyses indicated that the steady 
state minimum (trough) concentrations (Cmin,ss) best predicted the probability of bleeding.  
Overall, the edoxaban 30 mg and 60 mg once daily regimes were safe and well tolerated by subjects 
with AF treated for 3 months in this Phase 2 study. There was a higher bleeding risk with twice-daily 
administration.  The  DU-176b  60  mg  bid  regimen  was  considered  unsafe  by  the  IDMC  due  to  an 
unfavourable benefit/risk ratio, and had to be terminated early as a consequence. Logistic regression 
analyses indicated that the steady state minimum (trough) concentrations (Cmin,ss) best predicted 
the probability of bleeding.  
Dose selection for phase III: 
Three  elements  were  considered  by  the  applicant  to  support  the  proposed  dose.  Firstly,  to  select 
doses for the Phase 3 pivotal study that were likely to have a 10 to 20% reduction in bleeding when 
compared to warfarin at no potential cost of efficacy (no numerical increase in thrombotic events and 
similar effect on PD biomarkers). The second step was to identify a priori subjects who would have 
increased  drug  exposure  and  potentially  increased  risk  of  bleeding  and  hence  benefit  from  dose 
reduction. The final step was to use the Phase 3 data to identify the optimal dose regimen, validate 
the dose reduction criteria and identify any other groups who may be at high risk of bleeding who 
would benefit from a lower dose. 
A large Phase 2 study (PRT018) in NVAF subjects compared edoxaban 30 mg QD, 30 mg BID, 60 mg 
QD, and 60 mg BID and warfarin. All the regimens showed the potential for adequate efficacy based 
on  PD  biomarkers  but  the  once  daily  regimens  showed  a  similar  or  better  bleeding  profile  when 
compared with warfarin. The DU-176b 60 mg BID regimen was considered unsafe by the IDMC due to 
an unfavourable benefit/risk ratio, and had to be terminated early as a consequence. The findings 
were supported by PK/bleeding modeling which showed that Cmin rather than AUC or Cmax was the 
driver of bleeding events. Based on these data, both 30 mg QD and 60 mg QD were taken forward in 
the NVAF Phase 3 pivotal study. 
To identify factors for dose reduction, data from two Phase 2 NVAF studies in subjects (PRT018 and 
J225)  plus  DDI  studies  were  evaluated  by  clinical  assessment  and  pharmacometric  modeling 
(TMPP004). In univariate analysis, age and sex had a significant effect but dropped out of multivariate 
analysis, which identified three independent factors (moderate to severe renal impairment, weight < 
60 kg and concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors) that would increase exposure to edoxaban and also 
potentially increase the risk of bleeding compared with warfarin. Looking at these factors individually 
and in combination, a 50% dose reduction was selected so that in subjects with one or more of these 
factors the bleeding risk would be similar to the overall population while efficacy would be maintained. 
Supporting data with regard to weight was obtained from the subsequently completed study J226. 
The rationale for the Phase 3 dose section in NVAF was discussed with the CHMP and accepted.  
The dose justification for edoxaban in VTE is essentially the same as for NVAF except that there were 
no dose finding studies in VTE and the clinical considerations of use with heparin and the increased 
risk of under anticoagulation that could lead to fatal pulmonary embolism. The standard of care for 
comparison was parenteral heparin with concomitant warfarin titrated to an INR of 2 to 3. For VTE, 
only the 60 mg dose was selected because of the increased thrombotic load in VTE and the need for 
intensive anticoagulation in a treatment setting rather than in NVAF, where the aim is prevention of 
thromboembolic  events.  Therefore  weight  was  given  to  ensuring  a  dose  was  selected  that  would 
ensure efficacy while still being able to demonstrate a 10% reduction in bleeding.

This  bridging  approach,  using  principally  data  from  NVAF  and  VTE  prophylaxis  subjects  for  dose 
selection of VTE treatment, was discussed with CHMP, as was the rationale for the dose reduction and 
the selection of the single 60 mg dose for VTE. 
The  study  C-J307  in  93  patients  with  several  degrees  of  renal  function,  showed  that  the 
administration of 15 mg of DU-176b for 12 weeks in Japanese patients with SRI did not result in a 
marked increase in bleeding compared to the low dose or high dose of DU-176b (30 mg OD and 60 mg 
OD, respectively) in patients with Normal/MiRI. The plasma concentrations in the subjects with SRI 
(15 mL/min ≤ CLCR < 30 mL/min) receiving 15 mg of DU-176b overlapped considerably with those 
concentrations in the subjects with Normal/MiRI receiving the 30 mg OD dose or 60 mg OD dose of 
DU-176b. These data support the use of halved doses of edoxaban in patients with moderate-severe 
renal impairment (CrCL 15 – 50 mL/min). 
With respect to hepatic safety, in at least two phase II studies (PRT-018 and J225) there was at least 
one subject on edoxaban that showed concurrent elevations of AST (GOT) or ALT (GPT) ≥3 times the 
ULN and total bilirubin ≥2 times the ULN, with no corresponding cases reported in the warfarin control 
group. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
ENGAGE AF: Prevention of stroke and SEE in patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation 
Methods 
The efficacy data supporting the use of edoxaban for reducing the risk of stroke and SEE in subjects 
with NVAF are provided by the pivotal Phase 3 ENGAGE AF study (n=21,105 randomized patients; 
21,006 received at least one dose) in which 7002 subjects were treated with edoxaban 30 mg (15 mg 
reduced), 7012 subjects were treated with edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg reduced) and 7012 with warfarin. 
ENGAGE  AF  was  an  event-driven,  randomized,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  multinational, 
multicenter, parallel-group study.

Inclusion/exclusion  criteria:  ENGAGE  AF  enrolled  male  or  female  subjects  ≥21  years  of  age  with 
documented  NVAF  (including  paroxysmal,  persistent,  or  permanent  AF)  within  the  preceding  12 
months and in whom anticoagulation therapy was indicated and planned for the duration of the study. 
Subjects  who  were  receiving  or  had  received  prior  anticoagulant  (e.g.:  VKA  experienced)  and/or 
antiplatelet  therapies  were  eligible,  as  well  as  subjects  who  were  naive  to  anticoagulant  and/or 
antiplatelet therapy. In addition, eligible subjects were required to have a CHADS2 index score ≥ 2. - 
VKA experienced was defined as current users as well as former users who took VKA for greater than 
2 months.  VKA naïve were those subjects who received ≤ 2 months of VKA therapy before study 
entry.  Given that these definitions are not homogeneous across trials in NVAF, current EMA Guideline 
on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  prevention  of  stroke  and  SEEs  in  patients  with 
non-valvular  atrial  fibrillation  (EMA/CHMP/341363/2014)  recommends  sensitivity  analyses  using 
different  definitions  of  VKA-naïve  users in  order  to be  able to  compare  with  other  studies.  In  this 
regard, the applicant was requested to show the main efficacy and safety results using other previous 
definitions of VKA naïve: a) VKA use for < 6 weeks immediately before entry into the trial; b) patients 
not on a VKA at randomization; c) patients who had never been on a VKA. Subjects with mitral valve 
stenosis  (moderate  to  severe),  unresected  atrial  myxoma  or  a  mechanical  heart  valve  were  not 
allowed in the study. The intention of the sponsor/investigators was to represent “the typical NVAF 
population  encountered  in  clinical  practice”  at  the  time  in  which  the  study  was  designed  (clinical 
overview; module 2.5). However, this statement contrasts with the 25 exclusion criteria applied in the 
ENGAGE AF study. It is recognised that many of these exclusion criteria are standard for clinical trials, 
while  others  are  known  general  contraindications  for  anticoagulation.  However,  some  exclusion 
criteria may deserve specific commentaries. Patients with a mechanical heart valve were excluded 
from ENGAGE AF, but subjects with bioprosthetic heart valves and/or valve repair could have been 
included. The applicant proposes a warning stating that “Edoxaban has not been studied in patients 
with mechanical heart valves. Therefore, use of edoxaban is not recommended in these patients.” It 
is  implicit  in  the  proposed  warning  that  edoxaban  could  therefore  be  used  in  patients  with 
bioprosthetic heart valves and/or valve repair. The applicant was requested to describe the efficacy 
and  safety  data  available  from  patients  with  bioprosthetic  heart  valves  and/or  valve  repair  from 
ENGAGE AF. If the data are not robust, the warning should be extended to “prosthetic heart valves” 
in line with the wording approved for Xarelto (rivaroxaban).  Subjects with severe renal insufficiency 
(calculated CrCL <30 mL/min) were excluded. In the proposed SmPC the non-recommendation of use 
was for patients with end-stage renal disease (calculated CrCL <15 mL/min). Despite patients with 
CrCl between 15 and 30 were not included in the ENGAGE study, the applicant had additional data in 
these patients from study C-J307 (see dose-finding studies). The results of this study supported a 
recommendation of use for edoxaban in patients with severe renal impairment not in end-stage renal 
disease. At the end the it was agreed that in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCL 
15 – 50 mL/min), the recommended dose is 30 mg Lixiana once daily while in patients with end stage 
renal disease (ESRD) (CrCL < 15 mL/min) or on dialysis, the use of Lixiana is not recommended 
Thromboembolic  risk  stratification:  Current  guidelines  recommend  the  use  of  CHA2DS2-VASC 
instead  of  CHADS2  score.  Compared  with  the  CHADS2  score,  the  CHA2DS2-VASC  score  markedly 
increases  the  number  of  AF  patients  for  whom  OAC  is  recommended.  Therefore  it  is important  to 
determine  by  randomized  trials  if  this  major  paradigm  shift  to  greater  use  of  OAC  using  the 
CHA2DS2-VASC  scoring  improves  patient  outcomes.  The  CHMP  has  agreed  the  wording  of  the 
indication  in  NVAF  for  other  NOACs,  which  includes  patients  with  a  CHADS2  index  score  ≥  1 
(approximately equivalent to current CHA2DS2-VASC score ≥ 2, in which anticoagulation is indicated 
as  per  current  ESC  guidelines)  (de  Caterina  et  al.  Eur  Heart  J.  2012;  33:2719-47).  The  CHMP 
approach has accepted to widen the target population from CHADS2 index score ≥ 2 (at least 2 points 
in CHADS2 tested in pivotal clinical trials) to CHADS2 index score ≥ 1 (“with one or more risk factors” 
generally not tested in clinical trials) in previous applications for NOACs. Therefore the wording of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 60/138 
  
  
 
requested indication for edoxaban was also accepted, as it is identical to that of the other compounds. 
However,  as  patients  with  CHADS2  index  score=1  were  excluded  from  the  single  pivotal  study 
ENGAGE-AF but are already included in the wording of the indication (e.g.: patients with only one of 
the following risk factors: age≥ 75 years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure 
(NYHA Class ≥ II), the applicant justified why the extrapolation of the available data from high risk 
CHADS2 score ≥2 to CHADS2 score =1 could be acceptable and discussed whether further studies are 
planned with edoxaban to generate clinical data in these patients at lower risk of stroke. The CHMP 
accepted the justification.  
Treatments 
In ENGAGE-AF, Eligible subjects were randomized to edoxaban 30 mg, edoxaban 60 mg, or warfarin 
(1:1:1  ratio)  using  stratified  randomization.  Within  each  CHADS2  stratum,  subjects  were  further 
stratified with respect to factors requiring edoxaban dosage reduction. In both edoxaban treatment 
groups, the dosage regimen was halved for subjects with one or more of moderate renal impairment 
(CrCL  ≥  30  mL/min  and  ≤  50  mL/min  as  calculated  using  the  Cockroft-Gault  formula),  low  body 
weight  (≤  60  kg)  or  for  subjects  on  specified  concomitant  medications  (verapamil,  quinidine, 
dronedarone). Each enrolled subject was to be treated with the study drug from randomization to the 
Common Study End Date (CSED) visit; this visit had to be within 90 days of the announced CSED 
(determined by the accrual rate of primary endpoint events), and it was the final dose day for all 
subjects. At the end, a total of 21105 subjects were randomized, and median duration of treatment 
exposure was 2.5 years and median duration of follow-up in the study was 2.8 years. Warfarin was 
the active blinded control and was provided by the Sponsor. International Normalized Ratio (INR) 
measurements were to be performed using uniform Point-of-Care (POC) devices supplied to all study 
sites. Warfarin doses were to be adjusted to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0, inclusive. A Japan specific 
amendment  was  created  to  allow  Investigator’s  in  Japan  to  comply  with  Japanese  guidelines  for 
warfarin  management  in  subjects  age  70  years  or  older.  In  those  Japanese  subjects,  the  dose  of 
warfarin  was  to  be  adjusted  to  maintain  an  INR  of  2.0  to  2.5.  Treatment  regimes  tested  in  the 
ENGAGE AF study are deemed appropriate. 
Objectives 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: as in other similar trials, the primary efficacy endpoint in ENGAGE-AF was a net 
clinical endpoint mixing thromboembolic events (ischemic/undefined stroke, SEE) and haemorrhagic 
stroke.  As  a  result,  there  has  been  double-counting  of  primary  efficacy/safety  events 
(thromboembolism/major bleeding) regarding haemorrhagic stroke (included in both main efficacy 
and  safety  endpoints).  Current  EMA  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for 
prevention  of 
stroke 
and  SEEs 
in  patients  with  non-valvular 
atrial 
fibrillation 
(EMA/CHMP/341363/2014) stresses the importance of excluding haemorrhagic stroke from the main 
efficacy endpoint. In this regard, the applicant provided the results of the primary endpoint with the 
thromboembolic events excluding haemorrhagic strokes. On the other hand, the definition of ischemic 
stroke/TIA used in ENGAGE-AF is unclear. In recent years, there has been a change in the diagnostic 
approach of TIA and ischaemic Stroke (from a time-based definition to a tissue-based definition), 
depending on the absence or presence of signs of brain infarction on neuroimaging. In current EMA 
Guideline (EMA/CHMP/341363/2014), it is recommended to adjudicate suspected strokes and TIAs as 
a group and to follow a tissue-based definition. A suspected TIA should be adjudicated as stroke if 
there is positive neuroimaging confirming a cerebral infarction, even if the duration of symptoms is of 
less  than  24  hours  [American  Heart  Association  (AHA)  and  American  Stroke  Association  (ASA) 
definition of TIA; Standardized Data Collection for Cardiovascular Trials (SDCCT) Initiative definition]. 
The  occurrence  of  a  TIA  (transient  episode  of  focal  neurological  dysfunction  without  positive 
neuroimaging) should not be part of the composite stroke endpoint, instead it is recommended to 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 61/138 
  
  
 
assess this as a secondary efficacy endpoint. In this regard, the applicant clarified the approach used 
in  ENGAGE  AF  to  differentiate  between  ischaemic  stroke  and  TIA  (time-based  definition  or 
tissue-based definition) and provided with appropriate sensitivity analysis with different definition of 
ischaemic stroke (including or excluding TIA with positive neuroimaging as being an ischaemic stroke) 
(tissue-based and time-based definitions, respectively).  
Secondary variables: A number of secondary variables were included (each of the components of 
the  main  outcome;  composite of  stroke,  SEE,  and  CV  mortality;  MACE,  which  is  the  composite  of 
non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal SEE, and death due to CV cause or bleeding; Composite of 
stroke, SEE, and all-cause mortality). These endpoints are considered acceptable.  
Sample size 
Randomisation 
An  Interactive voice/web response system (IXRS)  was used. Eligible subjects in ENGAGE-AF  were 
stratified by CHADS2 risk score (2 and 3 versus ≥4). Within each CHADS2 stratum, subjects were 
stratified further for factors (calculated CrCL ≥50 mL/min and ≤30 mL/min, low body weight ≤60 kg], 
concomitant  verapamil  or  concomitant  quinidine)  that  required  dosage  reduction  of  edoxaban. 
Randomisation methods in ENGAGE-AF are deemed appropriate. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  ENGAGE  study  used  a  double-blind  design,  which  is  the  one  recommended  by  the  guideline 
EMA/CHMP/341363/2014. Blinding/masking methods are deemed appropriate. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical methods applied in the ENGAGE AF study are considered acceptable. ENGAGE AF was event 
driven.  A  total  of  at  least  448  events  were  required.  Sample  size  calculation  is  endorsed.  The 
non-inferiority margin (HR <1.38) is comparable to that used in ARISTOTLE study with apixaban and 
more  restringing  than  the  1.46  used  in  the  RE-LY  and  ROCKET-AF  study  with  dabigatran  and 
rivaroxaban. The time to first stroke/SEE event (primary endpoint) in ENGAGE-AF was analyzed using 
the  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  including  treatment  groups  and  2  dichotomized  stratification 
factors as covariates (CHADS2 2-3 versus 4-6; full dose versus reduced dose in a given treatment 
group). The applicant focused its main analysis (non-inferiority) in a modified ITT population during 
the “on-treatment period”. However, the applicant also tested non-inferiority in the PP population 
during the overall study period according to CHMP recommendations during scientific advice, as well 
as in the PP population “on-treatment”, which is in agreement with the recent CHMP Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products for prevention of stroke and SEEs in patients with NVAF 
(EMA/CHMP/341363/2014) that states that “the analysis to show non-inferiority should include the 
primary  endpoint  events  while  taking  study  drug  including  a  period  of  3  days  after  study  drug 
discontinuation (on-treatment analysis). Sensitivity analyses should include events occurring 1 week 
and 1 month after study drug discontinuation in order to investigate a possible early rebound increase 
in thromboembolism after treatment cessation.”In order to control the studywise type-I error rate of 
two-sided α=0.05 for non-inferiority, each of these 2 comparisons (60 mg or 30 mg versus warfarin) 
were  performed  at  the  statistical  significance  level  of  two-sided  α=0.025,  respectively,  which  is 
endorsed.  The  analysis  of  superiority  was  only  planned  for  the  comparison  between  the  60  mg 
edoxaban  dose  and  warfarin  and  only  if  non-inferiority  was  first  established  for  that  group.  The 
significance level of α=0.01 for superiority was selected by the sponsor because this was a single 
pivotal study. This was endorsed by the CHMP. The planned applicant’s analysis to show superiority 
(ITT,  overall  study  period)  was  consistent  with  the  approach  stated  in  the  EMA  Guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/341363/2014). Exploratory analyses of subgroups were conducted depending on at least 
14 patient/study characteristics. These analyses are discussed under “ancillary analyses” subsection.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 21,105 subjects who were randomized (7034, 70135, and 7036 in the edoxaban 30 mg, 
edoxaban 60 mg, and warfarin treatment groups, respectively) (ITT). 21,026 subjects were treated 
with  study  drug  (7002,  7012,  and  7012  in  the  edoxaban  30  mg,  edoxaban  60  mg,  and  warfarin 
treatment groups, respectively) (mITT). 20,970 subjects who were treated with study drug and had 
no major protocol violations (6982, 6995, and 6993 in the edoxaban 30 mg, edoxaban 60 mg, and 
warfarin treatment groups, respectively) (PP set). 
Conduct of the study 
A  total  of  46  countries  from  6  regions  (North  America,  Latin  America,  Western  Europe,  Eastern 
Europe, Asia Pacific and South Africa, and Japan) randomized subjects in this study. A total of 1420 
investigational study sites screened at least 1 subject and 1393 study sites randomized at least 1 
subject  in  this  study.  The  rate  of  screening  failures  was  relatively  low  (17%).  There  were  few 
differences between the ITT, mITT and PP populations, with a difference between populations of less 
than 50 subjects per group. Only one patient was lost to follow-up, which is a signal of good quality of 
study  oversight.  There  were  7  amendments  with  extensive  major  changes  in  the  protocol  of  the 
ENGAGE-AF study. In particular, amendment 3 could have implications on the quality of management 
in warfarin control group and dosing errors. As a result, it was unknown if the changes made in the 
protocol before and after amendment 3 could have had implications on study results. The applicant 
showed the analyses of the main efficacy and safety outcomes in the ENGAGE AF study (edoxaban 60 
mg vs. warfarin) in the subgroup of patients recruited before and after amendment 3 (29-Jul-2010). 
On the positive side, it seems that these amendments were based on gained experience from other 
contemporary studies in AF (e.g.: RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE). For example, in amendment 1, 
transition 
from  blinded  study  drug 
to  open-label  warfarin  was  clarified  and  added 
explanation/instruction  for  use  of  transition  study  drug  kit.  This  issue  may  have  resulted  in  less 
tromboembolic events during the transition from edoxaban to warfarin after the end of study. 
Baseline data 
Population included in ENGAGE AF was an old population (mean 72 years; 40% > 75 years; 17% > 80 
years) at high risk of stroke (mean CHADS2 score of 2.8; 53% of subjects had a CHADS2 score ≥ 3).

There  was  no  representation  of  patients  with  CHADS2  score  0-1.The  majority  of  subjects  were 
Caucasian (81%) and male (62%). Overall, mean body weight was 84 kg and 10% of subjects had 
body weight ≤60 kg. Approximately 18% of subjects had a body weight >100 kg. Overall, the mean 
BMI was 29.5 kg/m2, with approximately 60% of subjects having a BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2.  
In all 3 treatment groups, CrCL was ≤50 mL/min in approximately 19% of subjects. The percentage 
of VKA naive subjects was 41% overall. Overall, 52% of subjects had permanent, 23% had persistent, 
and 25% had paroxysmal AF.  
The  percentage  of  subjects  from  each  region  was  comparable  among  the  treatment  groups. 
Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  were  from  Europe  (Eastern  Europe  34%  and  Western  Europe 
15%), 22% from North America, 13% from Latin America, 11% from Asia/Pacific and South Africa 
(excluding Japan), and 5% from Japan.  
More than 65% of subjects were receiving ACE inhibitors or ARBs, or beta blockers, and about 60% 
were taking diuretic agents. Other more frequent medications used included lipid lowering agents 
(approximately 48%), aspirin (approximately 30%), calcium channel blockers (approximately 31%), 
and  amiodarone  (approximately  12%).  Quinidine/verapamil  was  used  by  <4%  of  subjects  at 
randomization.

Outcomes and estimation 
Edoxaban  (or  matching  edoxaban  placebo  for  the  warfarin  group)  compliance  was  assessed  by 
percentage  of  doses  taken  (≥80%  versus  <80%)  at  each  compliance  visit  (every  3  months). 
Treatment compliance (more than 80% of tablets taken; i.e.: 6 or less tablets missed per month) was 
> 98% in almost all timepoints with the exception of Month 45 (98% and 93% for edoxaban 30 mg OD 
and 60 mg OD, respectively).Warfarin compliance was assessed by the percentage of time subjects 
INR was within the range of 2.0 – 3.0. The mean time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR: 2-3) was 
64.9%  (median  68.4%), which  is  comparable  to  contemporary  studies like  RE-LY  (mean:  64.4%; 
median 67%) or ARISTOTLE (mean: 62.2%; median: 66%) and higher than in ROCKET-AF (mean: 
55.2%;  median:  58%)  (Gómez-Outes,  et  al.  Thrombosis.  2013;  640723).  As  expected,  the  more 
frequent deviation was undercoagulation, with a 22.8% of the time below therapeutic range (INR<2). 
The  percent  time  above  therapeutic  range  (INR>3)  was  12.4%  (mean  values).  By  regions,  North 
America,  Western  Europe  and  Japan  had  a  mean  TTR  of  70.2%,  68.3%  and  70.3%  respectively. 
Eastern Europe had a mean of 62.5%, Latin America had a mean TTR of 61.5%, and Asia/Pacific and 
South  Africa  (excluding  Japan)  had  a  mean  TTR  of  58.10%.  These  data  indicate  that  quality  of 
anticoagulation with warfarin was relatively good in western Europe, North America and Japan, and of 
a poorer quality in eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) and South Africa. 
The correlation between quality of anticoagulation and efficacy is further discussed under “ancillary 
analyses”. 
Non-inferiority of edoxaban 60 mg was shown in the primary sponsor’s analysis of all strokes/SEE 
(mITT, on-treatment) as well as in the sensitivity analysis for ischemic stroke/SEE according to CHMP 
guideline  on  NVAF  (PP,  on-treatment),  but  superiority  was  not  shown  for  the  previous  mentioned 
endpoints in the ITT population in the overall study period (see below). On the contrary, although the 
main  sponsor’s  analysis  suggested  non-inferiority  of  edoxaban  30  mg  versus  warfarin  on  all 
strokes/SEE, the sensitivity analysis using ischemic stroke/SEE (CHMP guideline) showed inferiority of 
the low edoxaban dose versus warfarin:  
a)  Stroke  and  SEE  -Non-inferiority,  mITT,  on-treatment  (study  protocol):  In  the  mITT 
on-treatment  period  (main  sponsor’s  analysis),  adjudicated  stroke  or  SEE  occurred  in  253 
subjects in the edoxaban 30 mg group (1.61% per year), 182 subjects in the edoxaban 60 mg 
group (1.18% per year), and 232 subjects in the warfarin group (1.50% per year). Compared to 
warfarin-treated subjects, the HR in the edoxaban 60 mg group was 0.79 (97.5% CI: 0.632, 
0.985, p<0.0001 for non-inferiority) and in the edoxaban 30 mg group was 1.07 (97.5% CI: 
0.874, 1.314, p=0.0055 for non-inferiority).

of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.73 to 1.15) (97.5% CI: 0.71 to 1.23). More subjects in the edoxaban 30 mg

EMA/CHMP/341363/2014):the  event  rate  for  ischemic  stroke  and  SEE  was  the  similar  in 
both the edoxaban 60 mg group and the warfarin group (1.33% vs. 1.36% per year), with an HR 
of  0.98  (99%  CI:  0.78  to  1.23;  p  =  0.7903).  More  subjects  in  the  edoxaban  30  mg  group 
experienced ischemic stroke/SEE compared with the warfarin group (event rate of 1.89% and 
1.36% per year, respectively), with an HR of 1.39 (99% CI: 1.12 to 1.72; p < 0.0001). 
Stroke/SEE  during  temporary  interruptions:The percentage of subjects with 1 or more study 
drug  interruptions  (>  3  consecutive  days  during  which  the  subject  did  not  take  study  drug)  was 
62.5%, 61.8%, and 65.5%, respectively, among the edoxaban 60 mg, edoxaban 30 mg, and the 
warfarin  treatment  groups.  Thromboembolic  events  occurring  during  temporary  interruptions 
(starting Day 4 of each interruption period to resumption of study drug after each interruption)were 
not included in the “on-treatment analysis” of non-inferiority. There were 117 stroke/SEE events on 
edoxaban 60 mg and 112 stroke/SEE events on warfarin during temporary interruptions (starting Day 
4 of each interruption period to resumption of study drug after each interruption). However, when 
corrected by exposure, the yearly event rate was quite similar (edoxaban 3.06 %/yr vs. warfarin 3.04 
%/yr). All-cause, cardiovascular mortality events, hemorrhagic strokes and intracranial bleed events 
were  lower  in  the  edoxaban  60-mg  group  compared  with  the  warfarin  group  during  temporary 
interruptions. 
Stroke/SEE after the end of study (study drug discontinuation): The percentage of subjects 
with adjudicated events after 3 days was low and similar in the three treatment groups (0.2%). From 
day 4 to 30 after end of study, the percentage of patients with stroke was 1.3%, 1.8% and 1.4% in 
the edoxaban 60 mg OD, edoxaban 30 mg OD and warfarin, respectively. These data indicate that the 
management of oral anticoagulation after study drug discontinuation in ENGAGE AF was appropriate. 
Edoxaban dose reduction was only one of the 4 key components for the transition plan from edoxaban 
to VKA. There were 4 key components: 1) selection of the oral anticoagulant (VKA or an NOAC) by the 
treating  physician  and  patient;  2)  a  14-day  transition  kit  of  modified-dose  edoxaban  for  patients 
randomized to edoxaban (30 mg once daily for patients in whom the edoxaban dose was not reduced 
before the end-of-trial visit and 15 mg once daily for patients in whom the edoxaban dose had been 
reduced  before  the  end-of-trial  visit,  regardless  of  randomized  edoxaban  drug  assignment)  or 
matching placebo for patients randomized to warfarin; 3) early and frequent INR testing (≥3 tests 
during  the  first  2  weeks);  and  4)  use  of  a  VKA  titration  algorithm  [Ruff  et  al.  J  Am  Coll  Cardiol. 
2014;64:576-84].  
Control of INR during transition from edoxaban to warfarin was optimal in ENGAGE AF, and this is 
likely to be the main cause of the low rate of stroke and bleeding seen during the transition procedure. 
Frequent international normalized ratio (INR) testing and algorithm directed warfarin dosing allowed 
an INR ≥ 2 to be achieved promptly without giving a loading dose of warfarin. Median time to INR ≥

2.0 was 9 days in patients transitioned from edoxaban to warfarin in ENGAGE-AF. By 30 days after the 
end of the trial, 98% of patients transitioned from edoxaban to warfarin had ≥ 2.0 therapeutic INR 
value in ENGAGE AF. In spite of the limitations of across study comparisons,  these data compare 
favourably to those in contemporary trials (i.e.: ROCKET-AF). In order to ascertain the contribution of 
edoxaban in this process, the applicant modelled factor Xa activity over the 24-hour dosing period for 
the doses used in the ENGAGE AF study (TMPP008) and showed that even the 15 mg dose has some 
antithrombotic effect, although lower than that of a full therapeutic dose, as expected. The offset of 
activity lags the fall in plasma edoxaban concentration and hence there is more sustained activity of 
edoxaban over the 24-hour period than the pharmacokinetics would suggest. Simulations made by 
the  applicant  suggest  that  the  projected  incidence  in  ischemic  stroke  for  the  15-mg  dose  in 
monotherapy (≈2%/yr), although higher than that of warfarin (≈1%/yr), may retain some clinical 
effectiveness in absolute terms, as the estimated background risk untreated is 6 %/year (CHADS2 
score  3).  However,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that  edoxaban  15  mg  is  not  to  be  administered  in 
monotherapy, but concomitantly with warfarin during the switching procedure. One of the problems 
for the other DOACs transition regimens was not only a lack of ischemic protection, but, importantly, 
of an increased rate of bleeding. This is the reason for the ENGAGE AF protocol to include provisions 
intended  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  bleeding  expected  for  those  patients  who  were  taking  two  oral 
anticoagulants concomitantly. On the other  hand,  SmPC information has been amended to reflect 
more accurately the switching process used in ENGAGE-AF.  An additional warning has been deemed 
necessary to prevent from treatment with suboptimal 15 mg dose in monotherapy and to make clear 
that the 15 mg dose isonly indicated in the process of switching from Lixiana 30 mg to VKA (patients 
with presumed increased exposure), together with an appropriate VKA dose (SmPC). 
Secondary  outcomes:  analyses  of  composite  (first-event)  endpoint  of  stroke,  SEE,  and  CV 
mortality, the endpoint of MACE, and the composite endpoint of stroke, SEE, and all-cause mortality 
were generally consistent with the analysis of the main endpoint of all strokes/SEE.  
Dose-response in efficacy: The trend for superiority of the high edoxaban dose (60 mg OD) versus 
warfarin for the primary endpoint is supported by secondary analyses of patients with fatal strokes 
(80 vs. 86) disabling strokes (54 vs. 57), recurrent stroke/SEE events (5 vs. 8; mITT analysis set 
on-treatment period) and analysis of the composite of stroke, SEE and TIA (edoxaban 60 mg 1.69% 
per year vs. warfarin 1.92% per year; HR: 0.88; 95%CI: 0.746 to 1.042; mITT on-treatment period; 
main sponsor’s analysis). On the contrary, the edoxaban 30 mg dose shows a trend for inferiority 
versus warfarin in the analysis of pure thromboembolic events (ischemic stroke/SEE as well as in MI). 
The trend for inferior efficacy of edoxaban 30 mg OD versus warfarin is also supported by the higher 
number of disabling strokes (82 and 57 subjects in edoxaban 30 mg group and the warfarin group, 
respectively),  in  the  number  of  patients  with  who  had  ≥  2  occurrences  of  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint (21 and 8 subjects in edoxaban 30 mg group and the warfarin group, respectively; mITT 
analysis set on-treatment period) as well as by the high number of events when TIA was added to 
stroke and SEE (edoxaban 30 mg event rate 2.28% per year vs warfarin 1.92% per year; HR: 1.19; 
95%CI: 1.021 to 1.389; mITT on-treatment period; primary sponsor’s analysis). However, there was 
a trend for superiority of edoxaban 30 mg versus warfarin in the reduction of haemorrhagic stroke and 
CV mortality (mainly due to the reduction in fatal bleedings), which might be of interest in patients at 
high risk of bleeding. 
Potential for dose adjustment in  patients at  high risk  of bleeding:  At the time of balancing 
efficacy and safety, the 60 mg edoxaban dose (with reduction to 30 mg in case of increased exposure) 
was considered the edoxaban dose with the best benefit-risk balance in NVAF. However, given the 
significant reduction of bleeding with the 30 mg edoxaban dose, the applicant discussed whether a 
dose reduction to 30 mg OD (in addition to those patients with moderate renal impairment and/or low 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015

body  weight  ≤  60  kg  and/or  concomitant  verapamil,  quinidine  or  dronedarone)  should  also  be 
considered in patients at high risk of bleeding (please see Discussion on Clinical Efficacy section). 
Exploratory analyses of subgroups in ENGAGE-AF were conducted by INR/TTR level by centre 
and quartiles as well as by at least 14 patient/study characteristics. Efficacy data in subgroups are 
difficult  to  interpret  by  the  inclusion  of  haemorrhagic  stroke  in  the  analyses.  In  this  respect,  the 
applicant was requested and provided the analyses of subgroups of efficacy by INR/TTR level (center 
and  quartiles)  and  by  patient/study  characteristics  excluding  haemorrhagic  stroke  (i.e.:  including 
only ischemic stroke and SEE) using the same analysis sets as in the ENGAGE study report. Subgroup 
analyses by patient/study characteristics showed a generally consistent effect of edoxaban in most 
subgroups, with the exception of subgroups by renal function and geographic  region in which the 
interaction  p-values  were  significant  for  both  edoxaban  doses  versus  warfarin.  The  HR  for  the 
edoxaban  60  mg group  compared  with  the  warfarin  group  for  Western  Europe  was  1.47  (95%CI: 
0.89-2.45; mITT, on-treatment) and for the subgroup with CrCL  ≥ 80 mL/min was 1.41 (95%CI: 
0.97-2.06).  The  main  primary  endpoint  results  in  ENGAGE-AF  study  seem  to  be  driven  by  an 
increased stroke/SEE rate with warfarin in Asia/Pacific/South Africa and Latin America (2.33% and 
2.60%,  respectively),  which  contrasts  with  the  1.13%  yearly  rate  of  stroke/SEE  found  in  western 
Europe.  In  general,  subgroup  analyses  of  ENGAGE-AF  for  INR  level  and  geographic  region  are 
consistent with a recent meta-analysis of subgroups of RE-LY (dabigatran vs. warfarin), ROCKET-AF 
(rivaroxaban vs. warfarin) and ARISTOTLE (apixaban vs. warfarin) (Gómez-Outes et al. Thrombosis. 
2013;  640723).  In  all  these  studies,  the  good  results  of  the  new  anticoagulants  were  mainly  at 
expenses  of  increased  stroke/SEE  rates  with  warfarin  in  Asia  and  Latin  America.  However,  the 
interaction by region seems more pronounced in the ENGAGE-AF study than in the other studies.  
In addition, the poorer results of edoxaban in the group of normal renal function versus impaired renal 
function for the primary endpoint was a novel finding (see also "Efficacy data and additional analyses" 
in the Discussion).

Subgroup  analyses  of  stroke/SEE  by  INR/TTR  level  suggest  that  the  effect  size  (reduction  of 
stroke/SEE by edoxaban) decreases as the quality of anticoagulation in the control group increases 
(i.e.: in centers with TTR > 60% and when INR/TTR is above the fourth quartile, >73.9%). When the 
TTR data are examined by quartiles for the edoxaban 60 mg group compared to warfarin, the HR for 
the primary endpoint in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartile was 0.80, 0.73, and 0.74, respectively, and for 
the 4th quartile was 1.07 (95%CI: 0.65-1.75). For the edoxaban 30 mg group compared to warfarin, 
the HR for 1st, 2nd, 3rd,  and 4th quartiles were 0.82, 1.02, 1.22, and 1.30  (95%CI: 0.81-2.09), 
respectively.  These  data  are  within  expected  on  the  light  of  previous  studies  with  novel  oral 
anticoagulants in NVAF.

HOKUSAI VTE: Treatment of VTE including DVT and PE, and prevention of 
recurrent VTE  
Methods 
The efficacy and safety of edoxaban in reducing the risk of symptomatic recurrent VTE in subjects with 
documented acute symptomatic DVT and/or PE is primarily based upon the large Phase 3 Hokusai VTE 
study in which 4118 subjects were treated with edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg reduced) and 4122 with 
warfarin  for  3-12  months  (all  patients  received  heparin-based  initial  treatment  for  5-12  days). 
Hokusai  VTE  was  an  event-driven,  Phase  3,  multinational,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind, 
matching  placebo,  parallel-group,  event-driven  non-inferiority  study  to  evaluate  the  benefits  and 
risks of edoxaban in reducing the risk of symptomatic recurrent VTE in subjects with documented 
acute symptomatic DVT and/or PE. At least 40% of subjects had to present with PE.

Study Participants  
Inclusion/exclusion  criteria:  HOKUSAI-VTE  enrolled  male  or  female  adult  subjects  with 
symptomatic  DVT  and/or  PE  documented  by  objective  methods.  Exclusion  criteria  were  similar  to 
other contemporary trials. Patients with active cancer (in which LMWH treatment instead of VKA is 
recommended), active liver disease, severe renal impairment or pregnancy were excluded, as well as 
those with contraindications to anticoagulation (e.g.: active bleeding) or treatment with potent P-gp 
inhibitors. Patients could have temporary risk factors only (such as trauma, surgery, immobilization, 
estrogen  therapy,  etc.)  for  which  a  3-month  treatment  may  suffice,  or  all  others  (e.g.:  intrinsic 
factors), for which a longer treatment may be needed. 
Treatments 
In  HOKUSAI-VTE,  eligible 
subjects  were 
randomized 
to 
(LMW)heparin/edoxaban  or 
(LMW)heparin/warfarin  using  stratified  randomization.  All  patients  received  initial  therapy  with 
open-label  enoxaparin  or  unfractionated  heparin  for  at  least  5  days.  Edoxaban  or  warfarin  was 
administered  in  a  double-blind,  double-dummy  fashion.  Edoxaban  (or  placebo)  was  started  after 
discontinuation of initial heparin. Edoxaban was administered at a dose of 60 mg orally once daily, 
taken with or without food, or at a dose of 30 mg once daily in patients with a creatinine clearance of 
30 to 50 ml per minute or a body weight of 60 kg or less or in patients who were receiving concomitant 
treatment with potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors. The study was designed with the aim of broadening 
applicability to real-world practice and encouraging the enrolment of all patients, including those with 
extensive disease, by specifying that treatment should be initiated with the proven, global standard of 
parenteral heparin; that the dose of the study drug should be halved in patients perceived to be at 
higher risk for bleeding (e.g., those with renal impairment or low body weight); and that physicians 
should  be  allowed  to  adjust  the  duration  of  treatment  after  3  months  according  to  their  clinical 
judgment or in keeping with evolving evidence. Dosing in the experimental group (heparin lead-in 
followed by edoxaban) is similar to the dosing selected for dabigatran trials in acute VTE (RE-COVER 
I and II), but different from the single drug approach (no need for heparin lead-in, using higher doses 
of the new anticoagulant during the first weeks and followed by a lower maintenance dose) used in 
rivaroxaban trials (EINSTEIN DVT and PE) and apixaban pivotal trial in acute VTE (AMPLIFY). This is 
an important difference in dosing between edoxaban and the other Factor Xa inhibitors. In order to 
avoid medication errors, it should be stated in section 4.2 of the SmPC that Lixiana is to be started 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 75/138 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
following  initial  use  of  heparin  (subcutaneous  low-molecular-weight  heparin  or  intravenous 
unfractionated heparin) for at least 5 days. 
Treatment regimes tested in the HOKUSAI-VTE study are in general deemed appropriate. However, 
study duration was left to the investigator. Although it was endorsed that this approach may mimic 
standard practice, it was considered unfortunate that a second randomisation, or a second study was 
not  performed  in  patients  having  received  anticoagulation  after  3-6  months,  in  order  to  generate 
randomised clinical data versus placebo or active comparator in the setting of extended treatment of 
VTE (i.e.: as conducted in the EINSTEIN-ext with rivaroxaban, RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE study with 
dabigatran or the AMPLIFY-ext study with apixaban). However, the design and analysis (mITT Overall 
versus On-Treatment) of the study allowed for assessment of the extension of therapy/the secondary 
prevention of VTE without the need for a formal “extension” study. Furthermore this “extension” study 
within  Hokusai  was  performed  with  an  active  comparator-warfarin  rather  than  placebo  allowing  a 
more robust comparison as to the real world risk benefit if continued therapy. As such the indication 
for  both  the  active  treatment  of  acute  VTE  and  secondary  prevention  of  recurrent  VTE  were 
demonstrated with the Hokusai VTE study with up to 12 months of therapy. Therefore, it was agreed 
that a separate "extension" study was not warranted. 
Objectives 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome in HOKUSAI-VTE was symptomatic recurrent VTE (i.e., the composite of 
DVT, non-fatal PE, and fatal PE). The secondary efficacy outcome added was the same but adding 
all-cause mortality. The main analysis set was the mITT during the overall study period (12 months). 
CEC  adjudication  results  was  the  basis  of  the  analyses.  The  objective  criteria  used  to  confirm 
recurrent VTE are in line with those used in contemporary studies in the acute treatment of VTE and 
are considered acceptable. In this regard, the CHMP Guidance on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for the treatment of venous thromboembolic disease [CPMP/EWP/563/98] published in 2000 
(now in revision), states that if, in exceptional cases, recurrent VTE events diagnosed only by clinical 
symptoms are followed by acute, new antithrombotic therapy, such events could be considered for 
inclusion in the endpoint only after adjudication by the clinical events committee. The applicant has 
confirmed  that  approximately  8%  of  primary  efficacy  events  were  adjudicated  events  without 
confirmatory imaging. These events mainly included VTE-related deaths. However, the events were 
equally distributed in both groups and sensitivity analysis excluding these events (HR: 0.90: 95%CI: 
0.69-1.16) yielded very similar results than the main analysis (HR: 0.89; 95%CI: 0.70-1.13), thus 
supporting non-inferiority of edoxaban under different assumptions. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation  in  HOKUSAI-VTE  study  was  stratified  by  presenting  diagnosis  (PE  and  DVT  only), 
Baseline risk factors (temporary risk factors vs. all others), and need for edoxaban dose reduction to 
30  mg  (yes,  no).  An  Interactive  voice/web  response  system  (IXRS)  was  used.  Randomisation 
methods in HOKUSAI-VTE study are considered acceptable. 
Blinding (masking) 
The HOKUSAI-VTE study used a double-blind design, which is in line of the one used in the recent 
RE-COVER  studies  with  dabigatran  and  AMPLIFY  study  with  apixaban  (EINSTEIN  studies  with 
rivaroxaban followed an open-label design). Blinding/masking methods are deemed appropriate. 
Statistical methods 
HOKUSAI-VTE was event driven. A total of at least 220 events were required. Sample size calculation 
is  endorsed.  The  primary  efficacy  analysis  of  the  HOKUSAI-VTE  study  was  based  on  a  modified 
Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set (subjects who are randomized and received at least one dose of 
Assessment report

study  drug)  using  all  primary  efficacy  events  (symptomatic  recurrent  VTE)  that  occurred  in  the 
12-month study period. The time to the first event of the composite primary efficacy outcome was 
analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model including treatment and the stratification factors as 
covariates. The experimental regime was considered non-inferior to the comparator if the upper limit 
of  the  95%CI  for  the  HR  was  less  than  1.5.  The  non-inferiority  margin  (HR  <1.50)  is  the  more 
restrictive one use in recent studies with novel oral anticoagulants in the treatment of VTE (1.80 in 
AMPLIFY; 2.0 in EINSTEIN studies; 2.75 in RE-COVER studies). During discussion with the CHMP SA 
procedure, it was advised that the preferred assessment for non-inferiority of the primary endpoint, 
recurrent VTE (the composite endpoint of DVT, non-fatal PE and fatal PE), was the treatment period 
plus 30 days tested using the PP analysis set; although the mITT analysis for the overall study period 
was also important. The sponsor decided to maintain the main analysis of non-inferiority in the mITT 
in the overall study period but planned sensitivity analyses for non-inferiority and superiority in the 
mITT  and  PP  population  at  different  study  time  points  (on-treatment  period;  treatment  +30  days 
period; first 90 days). In the CHMP view, primary analysis of non-inferiority should have been focused 
on recurrent VTE in the PP population on-treatment. However, this analysis has been provided at least 
as sensitivity analysis, which is endorsed. The superiority analysis should have focused on recurrent 
VTE + all-cause mortality in a pure ITT population (randomized patients) in the overall study period. 
However, as the proportion of randomized patients that were excluded from the mITT population was 
less than 1% (see “participant flow”), the mITT analysis conducted by the applicant was considered 
appropriate  for  the  analysis  of  superiority.  Superiority  was  tested  for  the  secondary  endpoint  of 
symptomatic  recurrent  DVT,  non-fatal  symptomatic  recurrent  PE,  and  all-cause  mortality  (mITT, 
overall  study  period).  An  α=0.01  two-sided  was  chosen  and  the  analysis  was  based  on  the  mITT 
Analysis  Set  using  the  same  proportional  hazard  model  as  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis. 
Exploratory  analyses  of  subgroups  were  conducted  depending  on  at  least  16  patient/study 
characteristics. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Populations  analysed:  A total of 8292 subjects were randomized and assigned to the edoxaban 
(N=4143) or warfarin (N=4149) treatment groups, and a total of 8240 subjects were treated with 
edoxaban (N=4118) or warfarin (N=4122) (mITT set).  
There was no screening period in Hokusai VTE, which is consistent with the acute and serious nature 
of the event to be treated. The critical study qualification work-up was conducted outside of the study 
as a matter of routine for the management of VTE. These procedures were deemed acceptable if done 
within 48 hours before randomization. . Of the 8,240 mITT subjects, 65 (0.8%) subjects withdrew 
consent and 11 (0.1%) were lost to follow up.

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 439 investigational study sites in 37 countries randomized at least one subject in this trial. 
The countries were classified into 10 regions (South Europe, Central Europe, Nordic, Eastern Europe, 
China/Japan, Western Europe, Other Asian, Australia-New Zealand, South Africa/South America, and 
United States and Canada). 
There were 4 amendments to the original protocol of the HOKUSAI-VTE study dated 24 Aug 2009. It 
is unlikely that the amendments had impact the integrity of the study. 
Baseline data 
The baseline characteristics of the patients included in the HOKUSAI-VTE study were similar in the two 
study  groups.  The  mean  age  was  56  years  and  the  majority  of  subjects  were  males  (57%). 
Approximately 41% of patients presented PE as index event. Risk factors for VTE were transient in 
28% of patients. Intented treatment duration was 3 months in 6% of patients, 6 months in 37% of 
patients and 12 months in 57% of patients.

The  regions  throughout  Europe  enrolled  the  majority  of  subjects.  Approximately  17%  of  subjects 
required  the  30  mg  edoxaban  at  randomization  due  to  body  weight  ≤  60  kg  (10%),  CrCL  30-50 
mL/min (4%), or for the use of quinidine/verapamil (0.5%). Post- randomization requirement for 30 
mg  edoxaban/edoxaban  placebo  occurred  in  123  subjects  (68  for  edoxaban  and  55  for  edoxaban 
placebo (active warfarin), respectively. Approximately 17.6% of subjects had their dose adjusted at 
randomization. Approximately 8% of the dose reductions were due to concomitant medication with 
P-gp inhibitors. However, only 0.8% is due to concomitant treatment of with the examples given in 
the protocol (verapamil, quinidine or dronedarone). The numerically more important subgroup was

the group of azole antifungals, macrolides and “other” (4.6% including captopril, carvedilol, diltiazem, 
felodipine, ticagrelor, and ranolazine, among others). 
Numbers analysed 
Table E-17: Number of Subjects in Analysis Sets – All Randomized Subjects 
Major  protocol  deviations  were  reported  in  23%  of  patients  (Table  14.1.2.1  of  the  HOKUSAI-VTE 
study  report).  Most  of  them  (16%)  corresponded  to  the  use  of  disallowed  medications  (mainly 
disallowed  NSAIDs)  that  impacts  the  evaluation  of  main  efficacy/safety  endpoints,  followed  by 
pretreatment  for  more  than  48  hours  with  therapeutic  dosages  of  anticoagulant  treatment  before 
randomisation (4%). However, it was not endorsed that patients with major protocol deviations were 
excluded from the PP analysis. Only patients for whom the index DVT or PE event at baseline could not 
be confirmed by the CEC were excluded from the PP population. This was considered inconsistent with 
the criteria followed in the ENGAGE-AF study, in which patients with all major protocol violations were 
excluded from the PP population. In summary, the original PP analysis of the applicant (not excluding 
all  major  protocol  violations)  favoured  the  demonstration  of  non-inferiority  of  edoxaban  versus 
warfarin  in  efficacy.  However,  non-inferiority  was  also  demonstrated  after  conducting  a  "true"  PP 
analysis (excluding all major protocol violations). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Treatment  compliance:  Compliance  with  edoxaban  or  matching  placebo  was  analyzed  as  the 
percentage of doses taken (≥ 80% to ≤ 120% of the planned number of doses) during the study 
treatment period. In the edoxaban and edoxaban placebo groups, 93.6% and 93.3% of subjects in 
the mITT Analysis Set On-Treatment period were within the compliance range of ≥ 80% to ≤ 120%). 
This analysis suggests that the definition of compliance was quite insensitive to detect differences that 
could be of relevance (e.g.: a patient could have been declared compliant missing 5 consecutive doses 
per month). In this regard, sensitivity analyses were requested by narrower intervals of percentaje of 
doses taken (5-10% intervals), but could not be provided by the Applicant as the data as collected did 
not have sufficient granularity. The Applicant noted that compliance was high in both studies and it 
cannot  be  refuted  with  the  data  available.  Compliance  with  warfarin  was  analyzed  by  using  the 
subjects’duration of time in the INR therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) during the study treatment period. 
The  mean  time  in  the  therapeutic  range  (TTR)  was  63.5%  (median:  65.6%).  The  overall  mean 
percent  of  reported  INR  measurements  that  were  <  2.0  was  18.9%  and  >  3.0  was  17.6%, 
respectively. The mean TTR in HOKUSAI-VTE (63.5%) was above the upper range of TTRs reported in 
contemporary studies (from 57% in RE-COVER II to 62.7% in EINSTEIN PE). Therefore, in the overall 
study population, quality of anticoagulation was reasonable good.The correlation between quality of 
anticoagulation by region/center and efficacy is further discussed under “ancillary analyses”. 
Non-inferiority of edoxaban 60 mg was shown in the primary sponsor’s analysis of symptomatic 
recurrent  VTE  (mITT,  overall  study  period)  as  well  as  in  the  sensitivity  analysis  for  symptomatic

recurrent  VTE  (PP,  on-treatment),  but  superiority  was  not  shown  for  the  secondary  endpoint  of 
symptomatic recurrent VTE and all-cause death (mITT, overall study period. In addition, there was a 
huge  difference  in  the  number  of  VTE  events  “on-treatment”  and  “overall  study  period” 
(approximately half of total primary events occurred post-treatment) (see below):  
•  Recurrent VTE, mITT, overall study period (main non-inferiority analysis): Symptomatic 
recurrent VTE occurred in a total of 130 subjects (3.2%) in the edoxaban group, compared to 146 
(3.5%) subjects in the warfarin group, during the Overall Study Period. The Hazard Ratio (HR) for 
the edoxaban group vs. the warfarin group was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.703, 1.128). The upper bound of 
the 95% CI is 1.128, which was below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 1.5, and the 
difference  between  edoxaban  and  warfarin  in  the  time  to  first  occurrence  of  adjudicated 
symptomatic  recurrent  VTE  was  statistically  significant  for  non-inferiority  (p<0.0001)  (Table 
11.2).  
Table E-38: Primary Endpoint (Adjudicated Symptomatic Recurrent VTE), mITT Analysis 
Set – Overall Study Period 
The Kaplan-Meier curves (figure below) provide further support that continued exposure, remaining 
on therapy (Ontreatment versus Overall population) is associated with decreased recurrence and both 
analyses  (ontreatment  and  overall  population)  favors  edoxaban  versus  warfarin.  The  main  issue 
during HOKUSAI-VTE regarding duration of therapy, looking at post-treatment recurrences, was that 
many  patients  would  have  been  benefited  from  longer  treatment  durations  of  anticoagulation. 
Furthermore, the Kaplan Meier curves are linear data and there is long-term safety data from the 
ENGAGE AF. Due to the above mentioned reasons, it was agreed not to limit the duration of treatment 
of VTE to the 1 year tested with edoxaban in HOKUSAI-VTE.

•  Sensitivity analyses for non-inferiority: In the PP Analysis Set, a total of 64 subjects (1.6%) 
in the edoxaban group vs. 80 (2.0%) subjects in the warfarin group had recurrent VTE during the 
on-treament study period. The Hazard Ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.58, 
1.12).  The  upper  bound  of  the  95%  CI  was  1.12,  which  was  below  the  pre-specified 
non-inferiority margin of 1.5. All of the remaining sensitivity analyses of non-inferiority for the 
mITT Analysis Set, Overall Study Period and PP analysis set, excluding unexplained deaths for 
which  VTE  could  not  be  ruled  out  and  assessing  the  potential  impact  of  missing  data  are  all 
consistent with the results of the primary analysis.

•  Additional sensitivity analysis to show non-inferiority: In the original PP analysis (not 
excluding  all  major  protocol  violations  but  only  those  patients  without  confirmed  VTE  at 
baseline) there were 4057 patients on edoxaban and 4078 patients on warfarin. The HR for 
recurrent VTE was 0.85 (0.64 to 1.14; treatment+30 days). In the revised "true" PP analysis 
(excluding  all  major  protocol  violations)  there  are  3116  patients  on  edoxaban  and  3143 
patients on warfarin. The HR of edoxaban versus warfarin for recurrent VTE is 0.95 (0.68 to 
1.33; treatment+30 days), thus confirming  non-inferiority (p-value 0.0040). In summary, 
the original PP analysis of the applicant (not excluding all major protocol violations) favoured 
the  demonstration  of  non-inferiority  of  edoxaban  versus  warfarin  in  efficacy.  However, 
non-inferiority  was  also  demonstrated  after  conducting  a  "true"  PP  analysis  (excluding  all 
major protocol violations).  
•  Time onset of recurrent VTE events: There was a huge difference in the number of recurrent 
VTE events between the PP on-treatment analysis (edoxaban 64 events vs warfarin 80 events) 
and  the  mITT  overall  study  period  analysis  (130  events  vs  146  events),  which  indicates  that 
approximately half of the events during overall study period (66 events in each group) occurred 
after  anticoagulant  treatment  had  been  stopped.  On  the  one  hand,  it  is  reassuring  that  no 
differences  in  rebound  thromboembolism  were  noticed  between  groups  and  therefore  the 
non-inferiority of edoxaban vs. warfarin on-treatment was sustained at 12 months. On the other 
hand, it questions whether duration of anticoagulant therapy was generally insufficient during the 
trial.  
•  Recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality, mITT analysis set, overall study period (main 
superiority  analysis):  The  composite  endpoint  of  recurrent  VTE  and  all-cause  mortality 
occurred in 228 of subjects (5.5%) in the edoxaban group and in 228 subjects (5.5%) in the 
warfarin group (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.200, p=0.9933). Although recurrent VTE (DVT or PE) 
favoured  numerically  to  edoxaban  versus  warfarin,  there  was  a  numerical  imbalance  in  the 
number  of  deaths  in  the  overall  study  period  of  the  HOKUSAI-VTE  study  (edoxaban  122  vs 
warfarin 106), thus leading to a hazard ratio of 1.00. Analysing the timecourse of deaths, there 
was not an imbalance in on-treament deaths (edoxaban 35 vs warfarin 33). The imbalance was 
attributed to an excess in deaths due to infectious disease in the edoxaban arm after treatment 
had been stopped. This imbalance was not seen in the ENGAGE-AF study in a population with AF, 
which may indicate a chance finding. Deaths are also discussed under safety.

Table E-40: Adjudicated Secondary Endpoint (Recurrent VTE and All-cause Mortality), 
mITT Analysis Set - Overall Study Period 
Net  clinical  outcome  (composite of symptomatic recurrent DVT, nonfatal symptomatic recurrent 
PE, Major bleeding, and All-cause mortality) occurred in 138 subjects (3.4%) in the edoxaban group 
and  158  subjects  (3.9%)  in  the  warfarin  group  (HR:  0.87;  95%  CI:  0.696,  1.099;  p  =  0.2515). 
However,  these  results  correspond  to  a  secondary  PP  analysis  on-treatment,  and  not  to the  main 
analysis in the mITT, overall study period, which may have biased the results in favour of edoxaban, 
as  post-treatment  deaths  were  not  included.  For  the  shake  of  consistency,  the  applicant  was 
requested to show the results of net clinical outcome in HOKUSAI-VTE using the same approach as in 
the main analysis of the primary endpoint (i.e.: in the mITT population, overall study period). The HR 
and 95% CIs for the net clinical outcome using this approach (HR: 1.00; 95%CI: 0.85-1.18) suggest 
that  both  edoxaban  and  warfarin  (both  with  lead  in  parenteral  anticoagulant)  are  equivalent 
strategies for VTE treatment. The SmPC, section 5.1, has been amended accordingly. 
Subgroup  analyses  in  HOKUSAI-VTE:  The  effect  of  edoxaban  was  generally  consistent  across 
subgroups  tested  in  the  HOKUSAI-VTE  study.  Overall,  of  the  55  comparisons  presented  from  18 
subgroup  analyses,  most  (45)  resulted  in  a  point  estimate  favouring  edoxaban.  Statistically 
significant interaction was only found for fragile vs. non-fragile patients. Edoxaban effect was better 
in fragile than in non-fragile patients. In general, the effects of edoxaban were also better (although 
not statistically significant interaction was found) in index PE, age > 75 years and history of cancer, 
which is reassuring.  
Regarding the quality of oral anticoagulation, the edoxaban group had a relative reduction in risk for 
recurrent VTE compared to warfarin for subjects at centers TTR < 60% (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.574, 
1.364) and also at centers with TTR ≥60% (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.653, 1.153). The Hazard Ratio for 
the edoxaban group for centers with INR-TTR >55.8 ≤64.0% was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.496, 1.205).

Figure E-10: Forest Plot of Primary Endpoint (Recurrent VTE) by Subgroup, mITT Analysis 
Set – Overall Study Period 
Subgroups by renal function: In the subgroup of patients with normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 80 
mL/min),  no  significant  differences  between  edoxaban  and  warfarin  were  found  in  recurrent  VTE 
(3.3% vs. 3.2%), major bleeding (0.8% vs. 1.0%) or all-cause mortality (1.8% vs. 2.1%). Looking at 
the  overall  benefit-risk  in  terms  of  the  net  clinical  outcome  (recurrent  VTE,  major  bleeding  and 
all-cause  mortality)  there  is  considerable  overlap  between  the  CrCL  subgroups  and  no  statistical 
difference is apparent between the treatments, including the subgroup of patients with CrCL ≥ 80 
mL/min (3.1% vs. 3.2%; HR: 0.96; 95%CI: 0.71 to 1.29).   
Subgroups  by  treatment  duration:  There  was  significant  disagreement  between  planned  and 
actual  treatment  duration.  Of  the  subjects  intended  for  treatment  of  3  months  55.7%  received  3 
months  of  treatment,  whereas  24.4  %  received  3-6  months  of  treatment,  19.9%  received  >

6-months of treatment and 10.0% received a full 12-months of treatment. Edoxaban demonstrated 
non-inferiority to warfarin for the 6- and 12-month intended treatment duration subjects. The HR for 
the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  recurrent  VTE  (HR;  95%CI;  mITT,  overall  study  period)  was  1.34 
(0.52-3.41) in the 3-month intended treatment duration, 0.80 (0.57-1.12) in the 6-month intended 
treatment duration (edoxaban 62/1555 vs warfarin 75/1502) and 0.94 (0.66-1.34) in the 12-month 
intended  treatment  duration  (edoxaban  58/2339  vs.  warfarin  63/2371).  In  the  3-month  intended 
treatment duration the HR was 1.34 but was associated with a small sample size and numerically very 
few events (edoxaban 10/221 vs. warfarin 9/245).

Clinical studies in special populations 
A  clinical  study  in  93  patients  with  several  degrees  of  renal  function,  including  severe  renal 
impairment (study C-J307) has already been described and discussed under section 3.3 (dose-finding 
studies). No other studies in special populations have been submitted. For available efficacy data in 
special populations see also ancillary analyses subsection (subgroup analyses of the pivotal studies).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
2.5.3.1.  Phase II studies 
The totality of the data from the edoxaban clinical development program support the selection of the 
edoxaban 60 mg dose for phase III studies in NVAF and treatment of acute VTE, the dose reduction 
criteria and the magnitude of the dose reduction to 30 mg in subjects with reduced renal function, low 
weight and some of the identified P-gp inhibitors. In ENGAGE AF the primary efficacy endpoint (stroke 
+  SEE)  was  superior  for  the  60  mg  QD  as  compared  to the  30  mg  QD  regimen  albeit  the  rate  of 
haemorrhagic strokes was lower in the 30 mg QD group. On the other hand, for the secondary “net 
clinical benefit endpoint” (stroke, SEE, major bleeding events, mortality) the 30 mg QD dose was 
better than the 60 mg group due to the lower bleeding rates despite of lower efficacy. 
Efficacy and B/R of a BID vs. a QD dosing regimen were further requested by the CHMP during the 
procedure however lacking data on efficacy for a BID regimen, modelling of B/R of an adapted bid 
dose were not possible to be provided post hoc.  
2.5.3.2.  ENGAGE AF: Prevention of stroke and SEE in patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation 
ENGAGE AF enrolled male or female subjects ≥21  years of age  with documented NVAF (including 
paroxysmal,  persistent,  or  permanent  AF)  within  the  preceding  12  months  and  in  whom 
anticoagulation therapy was indicated and planned for the duration of the study.

Subjects  who  were  receiving  or  had  received  prior  anticoagulant  (e.g.:  VKA  experienced)  and/or 
antiplatelet  therapies  were  eligible,  as  well  as  subjects  who  were  naive  to  anticoagulant  and/or 
antiplatelet therapy. In addition, eligible subjects were required to have a CHADS2 index score ≥ 2. 
VKA  experienced was defined as current users as well as former users who took VKA for greater 
than 2 months. VKA  naïve were those subjects who received ≤ 2 months of VKA therapy before 
study entry. Given that these definitions are not homogeneous across trials in NVAF, current EMA 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for prevention of stroke and systemic embolic 
events  in  patients  with  non-valvular  atrial  fibrillation  (EMA/CHMP/341363/2014)  recommends 
sensitivity analyses using different definitions of VKA-naïve users in order to be able to compare the 
studies. Ancillary analyses provided by the applicant using different definitions of VKA experienced 
patients yielded very similar results to those of the primary analysis.  
•  Bio-prosthetic heart valves 
Patients  with  a  mechanical  heart  valve  were  excluded  from  ENGAGE  AF,  but  subjects  with 
bioprosthetic heart valves and/or valve repair could have been included. A total 321 subjects with a 
history  of  bio-prosthetic  heart  valves  or  valve  surgery  were  treated  with  study  drug  (either 
edoxaban or warfarin) in ENGAGE AF with 277 to 286 subject-year follow-up. Rates of stroke/SEE and 
major bleeding (main outcomes) in this subgroup were similar than in the overall study population. A 
further  clarification  whether  patients  with  bioprosthetic  heart  valves  were  included  in  the  first  3 
months after surgery for valve implantation was requested, as during the first 3 months, the tissue 
valve is in contact with the blood and cannot be treated like native valve disease. The Applicant was 
unable to identify the proportion of subjects with a recent history of bioprosthetic heart valve surgery 
and  a  non-recommendation  of  edoxaban  use  during  the  first  3  months  after  implantation  of  a 
bio-prosthetic heart valve was included in the SmPC accordingly.  
• 
Patients CHADS2 score = 1 
Patients with CHADS2 index score=1 were excluded  from the single pivotal study ENGAGE-AF but 
were  included  in  the  wording  of  the  indication  (e.g.:  patients  with  only  one  of  the  following  risk 
factors: age≥ 75 years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ 
II), the applicant was requested to justify why the extrapolation of the available data from high risk 
CHADS2 score ≥2 to CHADS2 score =1 could be acceptable. It could not be confirmed nor ruled out 
that the effect of edoxaban is different from that of warfarin in patients CHADS2 score = 1 using 
CHA2DS2VASc=  2  as  a  proxy,  due  to  the  limited  amount  of  patients  and  events  in  this  pos-hoc 
subgroup. However, compared with no treatment in patients with CHADS2 = 1, edoxaban 60 mg is still 
projected to reduce the rate of ischemic stroke/SEE by 2.5%/yr at a cost of a 0.7%/yr increase in 
major bleeding. The benefit in mortality versus no treatment is projected to be > 10%/yr. However, 
the results were hampered by its exploratory nature and by the combination of data from different 
studies/sources. The CHMP agreed that anticoagulation with edoxaban may provide additional benefit 
versus no treatment in patients with CHADS2 =1, and that the extrapolation is acceptable, as it has 
been accepted for similar compounds. With respect to the optimal dose to be used in this subgroup, 
considering that the edoxaban 60 mg dose was more effective than the 30 mg dose in preventing 
ischemic stroke/SEE in  ENGAGE  and that a significant proportion of patients with CHADS2 =1  has 
normal  renal  function  and  edoxaban  exposure  is  consequently  decreased,  it  seems  reasonable  to 
recommend the 60 mg dose over the 30 mg dose in these patients, as in the overall population. The 
applicant clarified that no further studies are planned with edoxaban to generate clinical data in these 
patients at lower risk of stroke. This was considered acceptable.  
• 
Treatment regimes tested in the ENGAGE AF 
In ENGAGE-AF, eligible subjects were randomized to edoxaban 30 mg or 60 mg, or warfarin (1:1:1 
ratio) using stratified randomization. Within each CHADS2 stratum, subjects were further stratified 
with respect to factors requiring edoxaban dosage reduction[moderate renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 30

mL/min and ≤ 50 mL/min as calculated using the Cockroft-Gault formula), low body weight (≤ 60 kg) 
or  for  subjects  on  specified  concomitant  medications  (verapamil,  quinidine,  dronedarone)]. 
Treatment regimes tested in the ENGAGE AF study were deemed appropriate. The ENGAGE 
study used a double-blind design, which is the one recommended by the EMA Guideline on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products for prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients 
with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (EMA/CHMP/341363/2014).  
• 
Results of the primary endpoint with the thromboembolic events excluding haemorrhagic 
strokes 
As  in  other  similar  trials,  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  ENGAGE-AF  was  a  net  clinical  endpoint 
mixing  thromboembolic  events  (ischemic/undefined  stroke,  SEE)  and  haemorrhagic  stroke.  As  a 
result, there has been double-counting of primary efficacy/safety events (thromboembolism/major 
bleeding)  regarding  haemorrhagic  stroke  (included  in  both  main  efficacy  and  safety  endpoints). 
Current EMA  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  prevention  of  stroke  and 
systemic  embolic  events  in  patients  with  non-valvular  atrial  fibrillation (EMA/CHMP/341363/2014) 
stresses  the  importance  of  excluding  haemorrhagic  stroke  from  the  main  efficacy  endpoint.  The 
applicant  provided  the  results  of  the  primary  endpoint  with  the  thromboembolic  events 
excluding  haemorrhagic  strokes,  in  line  with  the  above  mentioned  guideline.  The  rates  of 
ischemic stroke/SEE in the PP population, on-treatment was 0.93%/yr with edoxaban 60 mg and 1.01 
%/yr with warfarin (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.15; 97.5%CI: 0.71 to 1.23) thus supporting the 
non-inferiority  of  edoxaban  60  mg  versus  warfarin  in  the  prevention  of  ischemic  stroke/SEE 
(excluding  hemorrhagic  stroke)  at  different  CIs.  The  applicant  clarified  that,  in  ENGAGE  AF,  the 
time-based definition was used to differentiate between ischaemic stroke and TIA. There were few TIA 
events with abnormal imaging only (25 events: 10 on edoxaban 60 mg and 15 on warfarin) and the 
analysis of ischemic stroke using time-based definition (excluding TIA with positive neuroimaging as 
being an ischemic stroke) (HR: 0.99; 95%CI: 0.82-1.18) or using tissue-based definition (sensitivity 
analysis including TIA with positive neuroimaging) (HR: 0.97; 95%CI: 0.81-1.16) were very similar.  
•  Statistical methods applied in the ENGAGE AF study 
ENGAGE AF was an event  driven  trial. A total of at least 448 events were required. Sample size 
calculation was endorsed by the CHMP. The non-inferiority margin (HR <1.38) was comparable to that 
used  in  ARISTOTLE  study  with  apixaban  and  more  strickter  than  the  1.46  used  in  the  RE-LY  and 
ROCKET-AF  studies  with  dabigatran  and  rivaroxaban. The  time  to  first  stroke/SEE  event  (primary 
endpoint) in ENGAGE-AF was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model including treatment 
groups  and  2  dichotomized  stratification  factors  as  covariates  (CHADS2  2-3  versus  4-6;  full  dose 
versus  reduced  dose  in  a  given  treatment  group).  The  applicant  focused  its  main  analysis 
(non-inferiority)  in  a  modified  ITT  population  during  the  “on-treatment  period”.  However,  the 
applicant also tested non-inferiority in the PP population during the overall study period according to 
CHMP  recommendations  obtained  during  the  scientific  advice  procedure,  as  well  as  in  the  PP 
population  “on-treatment”,  which  is  in  agreement  with  the  recent  EMA  Guideline  on  clinical 
investigation of medicinal products for prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients 
with NVAF (EMA/CHMP/341363/2014) that states that “the analysis to show non-inferiority should 
include the primary endpoint events while taking study drug including a period of 3 days after study 
drug discontinuation (on-treatment analysis). Statistical methods applied in the ENGAGE AF study 
were considered acceptable.  
• 
Protocol Amendments 
There were 7 amendments with extensive major changes in the protocol of the ENGAGE-AF study. In 
particular,  amendments  3  and  could  have  implications  in  the  quality  of  management  in  warfarin 
control group and dosing errors. Ancillary analyses of efficacy and safety suggest that implementation 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015

of  Protocol  Amendments  3  and  4  may  have  led  to  an  improvement  in  warfarin  management. 
However, for both periods (before and after implementation of protocol amendments), edoxaban was 
associated with a lower rate of stroke or SEE events compared with warfarin. 
•  Non-inferiority of edoxaban 30 mg versus warfarin in sensitivity analysis 
Non-inferiority of edoxaban 60 mg was shown in the primary sponsor’s analysis of all strokes/SEE 
(mITT, on-treatment) as well as in the sensitivity analysis for ischemic stroke/SEE according to EMA 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for prevention of stroke and systemic embolic 
events in patients with NVAF (EMA/CHMP/341363/2014) (PP, on-treatment), but superiority was not 
shown for the previous mentioned endpoints in the ITT population in the overall study period. On the 
contrary, although the main sponsor’s analysis suggested non-inferiority of edoxaban 30 mg versus 
warfarin  on  all  strokes/SEE,  the  sensitivity  analysis  using  ischemic  stroke/SEE  (as  per  above 
guideline) showed inferiority of the low edoxaban dose versus warfarin. 
•  Study drug interruptions 
The percentage of subjects with 1 or more study drug interruptions (> 3 consecutive days during 
which the subject did not take study drug) was 62.5%, 61.8%, and 65.5%, respectively, among the 
edoxaban  60  mg,  edoxaban  30  mg,  and  the  warfarin  treatment  groups.  Thromboembolic  events 
occurring during temporary interruptions (starting Day 4 of each interruption period to resumption of 
study drug after each interruption) were not included in the “on-treatment analysis” of non-inferiority, 
but  off-treatment  events  on  the  first  3  days  study  drug  interruption  were  included  in  the 
"on-treatment  analysis".  Theoretically,  temporary  interruptions  are  more  dangerous  for  edoxaban 
than for warfarin, due to its shorter half-life. There were 117 stroke/SEE events on edoxaban 60 mg 
and  112  stroke/SEE  events  on  warfarin  during  temporary  interruptions  (starting  Day  4  of  each 
interruption period to resumption of study drug after each interruption). However, when corrected by 
exposure,  the  yearly  event  rate  was  quite  similar  (edoxaban  3.06  %/yr  vs.  warfarin  3.04  %/yr). 
All-cause, cardiovascular mortality events, hemorrhagic strokes and intracranial bleed events were 
lower  in  the  edoxaban  60-mg  group  compared  with  the  warfarin  group  during  temporary 
interruptions.  Considering  various  reasons  and  circumstances  for  study  drug  interruptions  and 
varying duration and nature of “off-study drug” antithrombotic therapies that may have been used by 
the investigators during interruptions, these data may need to be interpreted with caution. 
•  Adjudicated events after study drug discontinuation in ENGAGE AF 
After the end of study, the percentage of subjects with adjudicated events within 3 days was low 
and similar in the three treatment groups (0.2%). From day 4 to 30 after end of study, the percentage 
of patients with stroke was 1.3%, 1.8% and 1.4% in the edoxaban 60 mg OD, edoxaban 30 mg OD 
and warfarin, respectively. These data indicate that  the management of oral anticoagulation after 
study drug discontinuation in ENGAGE AF was appropriate. 
•  Consistency of the analyses for 60mg OD 
Analyses of composite (first-event) endpoint of stroke, SEE, and CV mortality, the endpoint of MACE, 
and the composite endpoint of stroke, SEE, and all-cause mortality were generally consistent with 
the  analysis  of  the  main  endpoint  of  all  strokes/SEE.  The  trend  for  superiority  of  the  high 
edoxaban dose (60 mg OD) versus warfarin for the primary endpoint was supported by secondary 
analyses of patients with fatal strokes (80 vs. 86), disabling strokes (54 vs. 57), recurrent stroke/SEE 
events (5 vs. 8; mITT analysis set on-treatment period) and analysis of the composite of stroke, SEE 
and TIA (edoxaban 60 mg 1.69% per year vs. warfarin 1.92% per year; HR: 0.88; 95%CI: 0.746 to 
1.042; mITT on-treatment period; main sponsor’s analysis).

Efficacy of 30mg OD strength

On  the  contrary,  the  edoxaban  30  mg  dose  showed  a  trend  for  inferiority  versus  warfarin  in  the 
analysis of pure thromboembolic events (ischemic stroke/SEE as well as in MI). The trend for inferior 
efficacy of edoxaban 30 mg OD versus warfarin was also supported by the higher number of disabling 
strokes (82 and 57 subjects in edoxaban 30 mg group and the warfarin group, respectively), in the 
number of patients with who had ≥ 2 occurrences of the primary efficacy endpoint (21 and 8 subjects 
in  edoxaban  30  mg  group  and  the  warfarin  group,  respectively;  mITT  analysis  set  on-treatment 
period) as well as by the high number of events when TIA was added to stroke and SEE (edoxaban 30 
mg event rate 2.28% per year vs warfarin 1.92% per year; HR: 1.19; 95%CI: 1.021 to 1.389; mITT 
on-treatment  period;  primary  sponsor’s  analysis).  However,  there  was  a  trend  for  superiority  of 
edoxaban 30 mg versus warfarin in the reduction of haemorrhagic stroke and CV mortality (mainly 
due to the reduction in fatal bleedings), which might be of interest in patients at high risk of bleeding. 
In post hoc analyses submitted together with D121 responses in subjects with high risk of bleeding, 
the edoxaban 30-mg regimen (30 mg with reduction to 15 mg) did not reduce ischemic events with 
HR more than 1.0 compared with warfarin. Based on the data on ischemic strokes/SEE, it was difficult 
to justify edoxaban 30-mg regimen (with the exception of those patients with increased exposure 
where 30mg OD dose is recommended: (1) moderate renal impairment and/or (2) low body weight ≤  
60 kg and/or (3) concomitant use with some P-gp inhibitors) for patients with high risk of bleeding. 
The analysis by HAS-BLED score did not identify a group who would benefit from the lower dose of 30 
mg.  Therefore,  ancillary  analyses  did  not  support  the  use  of  the  edoxaban  30  mg  dose,  even  in 
patients at high risk of bleeding. 
•  Number of strokes and undefined strokes 
There was an apparent discrepancy in numbers of primary endpoint events across tables, which 
was  due  to  the  inclusion  of  either  first  events  or  all  events.  The  primary  endpoint  in  the 
ENGAGE-AF study was time to first stroke/SEE. A total of 292 primary endpoint events were recorded 
for the edoxaban 60-mg group (made up of 278 strokes and 14 SEE) and 336 primary endpoint events 
were recorded for the warfarin group (made up of 315 strokes and 21 SEEs) (mITT population, overall 
study  period).  However,  18  subjects  in  the  edoxaban  60-mg  group  and  29  in  the  warfarin  group 
experienced  ≥  2  adjudicated  strokes.  Thus  more  events  were  counted  in  the  components  of  the 
primary endpoint analysis than in the primary analysis where only the first event was counted for a 
subject.  Regarding  confirmation  of  primary  events,  for  all  events  adjudicated  as  strokes  (either 
primary  ischemic  or  primary  hemorrhagic  stroke),  the  images  were  available.  All  primary  stroke 
(efficacy  or  hemorrhagic)  events  were  adjudicated  based  on  the  clinical  description  of  the  event 
accompanied  with  neuroimaging  studies.  However,  there  were  also  "undefined  strokes"  during 
ENGAGE-AF,  but  these  were  excluded  from  the  analysis,  mainly  for  not  having  confirmatory 
neuroimaging tests available. Numerically, there were more unconfirmed events with edoxaban than 
with warfarin (113 vs 104). Combining these events to those included in the study reported primary 
endpoint  as  sensitivity  analysis  yields  to  324  events  in  the  edoxaban  group  (event  rate  of 
1.72%/year) vs. 372 (event rate of 2.00%/year) in the warfarin group with a hazard ratio of 0.86 
(0.74,  1.00),  thus  still  favouring  edoxaban  60  mg  versus  warfarin.  Therefore,  the  inclusion  of 
unconfirmed  non-adjudicated  events  did  not  change  the  primary  study  results  indicating 
non-inferiority of edoxaban 60 mg versus warfarin.  
•  Adjudicated versus investigator-reported events 
With respect to adjudicated versus investigator-reported events, the number of Clinical Events 
Committee  (CEC)  adjudicated  strokes  (ischemic  or  hemorrhagic)  was  lower  than  the  investigator 
reported primary events. However, in both cases, the events were lower with edoxaban than with 
warfarin  (adjudicated:  edoxaban  278.  vs  warfarin  316;  investigator-reported:  edoxaban  288  vs 
warfarin  329).  Of  interest,  the  CEC  adjudicated  a  slightly  lower  number  of  ischemic  strokes  with 
edoxaban than the investigators (233 vs 235), but a higher number of ischemic strokes with warfarin 
than  the  investigator  (234  vs  220).  The  main  reason  for  the  discrepancy  seems  a  combination  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 95/138 
  
  
 
 
chance  and  a  lower  number  of  TIAs  that  were  upgraded  to  ischemic  strokes  by  the  CEC  in  the 
edoxaban group than in the warfarin group (13 vs 21). This small imbalance in the adjudication of TIA 
was considered by the CHMP unlikely to alter the conclusion of non-inferiority of edoxaban versus 
warfarin. In addition, investigators reported more SEE than the adjudicating committee, because they 
reported DVT and PE in addition to the arterial embolic events on the SEE form, but in both cases there 
were less SEE with edoxaban than with warfarin. If primary ischemic stroke and SEE as reported by 
the investigators are combined, the numbers are similar in both groups: edoxaban 305 (235+70) vs. 
warfarin 301 (220+81). Therefore, when counting all strokes, or the sum of ischemic stroke + SEE, 
there are no major discrepancies between investigator-reported and adjudicated primary endpoint 
events.  
Exploratory analyses of subgroups in ENGAGE-AF 
Exploratory analyses of subgroups in ENGAGE-AF were conducted by INR/TTR level by centre and 
quartiles  as  well  as  by  at  least  14  patient/study  characteristics.  Efficacy  data  in  subgroups  were 
difficult  to  be  interpreted  due  to  the  inclusion  of  haemorrhagic  stroke  in  the  analyses.  Subgroup 
analyses of stroke/SEE by INR/TTR level suggest that the  effect  size (reduction of stroke/SEE by 
edoxaban) decreases as the quality of anticoagulation in the control group increases (i.e.: in 
centers with TTR > 60% and when INR/TTR is above the fourth quartile, >73.9%). When the TTR data 
are  examined  by  quartiles  for  the  edoxaban  60  mg  group  compared  to  warfarin,  the  HR  for  the 
primary endpoint in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartile was 0.80, 0.73, and 0.74, respectively, and for the 
4th quartile was 1.07 (95%CI: 0.65-1.75). For the edoxaban 30 mg group compared to warfarin, the 
HR  for  1st,  2nd,  3rd,  and  4th  quartiles  were  0.82,  1.02,  1.22,  and  1.30  (95%CI:  0.81-2.09), 
respectively.  These  data  are  within  expected  on  the  light  of  previous  studies  with  novel  oral 
anticoagulants in NVAF.  
Subgroup  analyses  by  patient/study  characteristics  showed  a  generally  consistent  effect  of 
edoxaban  in  most  subgroups,  with  the  exception  of  subgroups  by  renal  function  and 
geographic  region  (for  both  edoxaban  doses  versus  warfarin).  The  HR  for  the  edoxaban  60  mg 
group compared with the warfarin group for Western Europe was  1.47 (95%CI: 0.89-2.45; mITT, 
on-treatment) and for the subgroup with CrCL ≥ 80 mL/min was 1.41 (95%CI: 0.97-2.06).  
•  Results by geographical region in the ENGAGE-AF study 
The main primary endpoint results in ENGAGE-AF study seem to be driven by an increased stroke/SEE 
rate with warfarin in Asia/Pacific/South Africa and Latin America (2.33% and 2.60%, respectively), 
which  contrasts  with  the  1.13%  yearly  rate  of  stroke/SEE  found  in  Western  Europe.  In  general, 
subgroup analyses of ENGAGE-AF for INR level and geographic region were consistent with a recent 
meta-analysis  of  subgroups  of  RE-LY  (dabigatran  vs.  warfarin),  ROCKET-AF  (rivaroxaban  vs. 
warfarin) and ARISTOTLE (apixaban vs. warfarin) (Gómez-Outes et al. Thrombosis. 2013; 640723). 
In all these studies, the good results of the new anticoagulants were mainly at expenses of increased 
stroke/SEE  rates  with  warfarin  in  Asia  and  Latin  America.  However,  the  interaction  by  region 
seems  more  pronounced  in  the  ENGAGE-AF  study  than  in  the  other  studies.  Although  the 
interpretation of the results in Western Europe is hampered by the limitations of subgroup analyses 
and the low event rates, additional information provided by the Applicant suggest that the cause of 
the poorer results of edoxaban in Western Europe than in other regions could be multifactorial, due to 
a combination of increased ischemic stroke/SEE rates in the edoxaban arms (a result of decreased 
exposure due to good renal function and increased body weight in many Western Europe patients in 
comparison  with  other  regions),  and  a  low  rate  of  ischemic/hemorrhagic  stroke  and  SEE  in  the 
warfarin arm, due to a good quality of oral anticoagulation in Western Europe centres in comparison 
with  other  regions.  Nevertheless,  it  should  be  taken  into  account  that  ENGAGE  AF  demonstrated 
non-inferiority of edoxaban 60 mg versus a well-controlled warfarin regime in the overall population.

All-cause and CVS mortalities were broadly similar in the overall vs. on-treatment analysis in both the 
edoxaban and warfarin groups in Western Europe, with point estimates of HR close to 1. Therefore, no 
safety signal was apparent in Western Europe. In addition, when the analysis was made in the region 
of the EEA + Switzerland, the results on ischemic stroke/SEE were broadly similar in the edoxaban 
and warfarin groups (HR 0.94 and 0.99 point estimates in the overall study period and on-treatment 
analyses,  respectively).  In  summary,  although  the  hazard  ratios  for  the  on-treatment  and  overall 
periods may show some variability, given in excess of 100 combinations of regions and endpoints this 
minor level of inconsistency in ischemic stroke/SEE is considered to be due to a combination of chance 
due to the extreme multiplicity of testing and probably due to a trend towards a better control of 
warfarin  treatment  in  Western  Europe  and  North-America  than  in  other  regions.  The  overal  study 
results are deemed representative for the EEA.  
• 
Poorer results of edoxaban in the group of normal renal function 
In  addition,  the  poorer  results  of  edoxaban  in  the  group  of  normal  renal  function  versus 
impaired renal function for the primary endpoint is a novel finding. Sub‐group analysis of ENGAGE-AF 
identified the increase in renal function as a significant predictor for increase in risk of stroke/SEE with 
edoxaban  60  mg  versus  warfarin  (interaction  p  =  0.0002)  and  edoxaban  30  mg  versus  warfarin 
(interaction p = 0.0077). Patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 80 mL/min) in the edoxaban 60 
mg tended to have a higher risk of stroke/SEE than warfarin-treated patients (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 
0.97‐2.06).  The  interpretation  of  that  finding  is  hampered  by  the  exploratory  nature  of  subgroup 
analyses and the relatively low number of events and patients with normal renal function. Comparing 
the  within-treatment  groups,  there  was  no  indication  that  a  better  creatinine  clearance  was 
associated with a higher rate of events with edoxaban, as the events rates of stroke/SEE, CV mortality 
and  MACE  were  lower  in  the  normal  renal  function  patients  than  in  patients  with  impaired  renal 
function  in  both  treatment  groups.  In  the  edoxaban  group,  stroke/SEE  rates  were  1.26%/yr  in 
patients  with  normal  renal  function,  lower  than  the  1.49%/yr  stroke/SEE  rate  in  mild  renal 
insufficiency  and  2.29%/yr  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  insufficiency  (see  Table  1  below). 
However, the lower event rates in patients with normal renal function could also be due to differences 
in demographic characteristics as patients with normal renal function tend to be younger and with a 
lower thrombotic risk as shown by lower CHADS2 scores than patients with renal impairment.The 
finding may also be due, at least in part, to a surprisingly low event rate with warfarin in patients with 
normal  renal  function,  with  strokes  rates  of  less  than  1%/yr,  while  in  contemporary  AF  trials 
(ARISTOTLE, RELY, ROCKET-AF), the rate of stroke/SEE in patients with normal renal function was 
always above 1%/yr (1.05%/yr to 1.42%/yr). This finding could be related to the fact that the quality 
of anticoagulation with warfarin in ENGAGE was best compared to other contemporary AF trials.

The CHMP agreed that in NVAF, although the overall benefit risk in the AF indication is considered 
positive  across  the  continuum  of  renal  function  at  the  population  level,  there  are  indications  of 
reduced efficacy of edoxaban compared to well-managed warfarin therapy that could be of relevance 
at the individual level in patients with increased creatinine clearance. The data in patients with normal 
renal function appear to be sufficiently robust, making a chance adverse finding unlikely. They may be 
explained by a combination of a lower exposure to edoxaban 60 mg in patients with normal renal 
function (in comparison with the exposure to 60 mg in patients with mild renal impairment) and a 
well-managed warfarin therapy resulting in a low stroke/SEE rate in the control group, particularly in 
patients  with  high  creatinine  clearances.  In  this  respect,  a  warning  has  been  included  in 
section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  that  a  trend  towards  decreasing  efficacy  with  increasing 
creatinine  clearance  was  observed  for  edoxaban  compared  to  well-managed  warfarin. 
Therefore,  edoxaban  should  only  be  used  in  patients  with  NVAF  and  high  creatinine 
clearance after a careful evaluation of the individual thromboembolic and bleeding risk. In 
addition, a warning was also included in the SmPC that CrCL should be monitored at the 
beginning  of  the  treatment  in  all  patients  and  afterwards  when  clinically  indicated.  The 
applicant  has  also  been  committed  to  further  evaluate  post‐marketing  whether  a  higher  QD  dose 
would provide a further improvement of the benefit‐risk relationship in patients with high creatinine 
clearance 
•  Monitoring of anti-Xa activity 
Monitoring  of  anti‐Xa  activity  may  be  helpful  to  individualise  the  treatment  and  dose  in  certain 
circumstances  (e.g.:  at  the  beginning  of  the  treatment  in  patients  with  cumulative  risk  factors  for 
decreased  exposure,  such  as  high  renal  clearance  combined  with  high  body  weight  or  in  case  of 
emergency or overdose). The Applicant has submitted a plan for developing a validated anti‐Xa test 
to measure edoxaban's anticoagulant activity.

•  Additional subgroups analyses 
During the procedure, the Applicant was requested to show the analyses of subgroups of efficacy in 
ENGAGE-AF by subgroups excluding haemorrhagic stroke (i.e.: including only ischemic stroke and 
SEE). The event rate for composite of ischemic stroke and SEE was lower in the edoxaban 60-mg 
group than in the warfarin group for most subgroups, with the HR less than 1.0 for the overall study 
period,  but  in  some  of  the  sub-groups  the  HR  was  more  than  1.0.  However,  there  were  several 
significant (p<0.05) interactions:  
(1) for the type of atrial fibrillation: The HR was 0.79 and 0.85 for subjects with persistent and 
permanent AFs and 1.73 for subjects with paroxysmal AF. However, this finding was based on a 
relatively low number of events and patients in this subgroup. The variations in stroke/SEE rates in 
the warfarin group was the main responsible for the interaction (1.23%/yr in paroxysmal AF versus 
2%/yr for other types of AF). This also holds true for contemporary AF studies, in which stroke/SEE 
with warfarin was lower in patients with paroxysmal AF than in those with permanent/persistent AF. 
No safety signal was apparent in this subgroup, and CV mortality numerically favoureds edoxaban. In 
the subgroups by type of AF there was no question of differences in exposure as the renal function of 
each subgroup was essentially the same. The interaction by type of AF is probably multifactorial, more 
related to variations in stroke/SEE rates with warfarin (unexpectedly low stroke/SEE rates in some 
subgroups) than corresponding variations with edoxaban, in line with the interactions reported by 
treatment region and by renal function.  
(2)  for  the  VKA-naïve  versus  VKA  experienced  subjects:  The  HR  was  0.75  for  VKA  naïve 
subjects and 1.17 for VKA experienced subjects. VKA-experienced patients comprise the majority of 
patients enrolled in ENGAGE-AF (59%) and suggest that switching from warfarin to edoxaban was not 
associated woth a benefit in efficacy. Considering the primary endpoint of stroke/SEE, a significant 
interaction  was  found  for  the  overall  study  period  for  prior  VKA  use  (p=0.0253)  but  this  was  not 
observed for the on-treatment period (p=0.3545). The most important patient characteristics of the 
VKA-experienced subjects was the increased TTR which at 70% is very high in the ENGAGE AF study. 
None-the-less for the primary endpoint of stroke/SEE, edoxaban 60 mg did show similar efficacy and 
even for ischemic stroke, any gap in efficacy was less than 0.5%/year and is offset by a clinically 
significant decrease in major bleeds, and demonstrating similar net clinical outcome and all-cause 
mortality. Therefore, edoxaban 60 mg showed a positive benefit-risk balance in absolute terms and a 
similar benefit-risk balance to VKA with very good TTR control, which was the rule in VKA-experienced 
patients and is not expected to be the rule in many EU countries in standard practice (a poorer INR is 
expected), with some exceptions in specific centers and/or countries. Therefore, the CHMP was of the 
opinion that there is no need to include the information about this finding in the label, especially given 
its  similar  performance  to  other  direct  oral  anticoagulants  (DOACs)  when  the  differences  in 
background risk and TTR are taken into account;  
(3) for the verapamil subgroup: The HR was 0.92 for subjects without concomitant verapamil and 
2.59  for  subjects  who  took  concomitant  verapamil.  Verapamil  use  was  very  low  (<5%  of  total 
population)  and  number  of  events  were  low  (18  vs.  7).  Notwithstanding,  it  suggests  that  the 
edoxaban 30 mg dose used in these patients was insufficient. Consequently, the applicant proposed 
not to reduce the edoxaban 60 mg to 30 mg when edoxaban is coadministered with verapamil or 
quinidine, which was endorsed.  
Other issues that were discussed during the procedure regarding the ENGAGE AF study are following:  
a)  There  were  728  subjects  for  whom  treatment  allocation  was  unblinded  because  of  SUSARs. 
Ancillary analysis indicated that there is no indication that unblinding of the data to the independent 
Data Analysis Group and the Data Monitoring Committee had an impact on the overall study results;  
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 100/138 
  
  
 
 
b) Dose adjustment rules for patients ≤ 60 kg came into place in Protocol Amendment 7. However, 
none of the 66 patients randomized before amendment 7 had a body weight ≤60 kg, and therefore 
none of them received the unadjusted 60 mg edoxaban dose;  
c) Ancillary analyses suggested that for those patients with the best quartile for center based results 
for  INR  numerically  efficacy  was  slightly  better  for  warfarin  than  for  edoxaban  60  mg  (ischaemic 
stroke, SEE, myocardial infarction). For haemorrhagic strokes, CV mortality, “net clinical outcome”, 
MACE and all cause mortality numerically the effects were still in favour of Edoxaban 60 mg. For major 
bleeds, major bleeds, CRNM bleeds and fatal bleeds the results were inconsistent. Taken the data 
together the CHMP agreed that edoxaban performs better, when compared to a suboptimal therapy 
with warfarin; 
d)  All  cause  mortality  and  CV  mortality  rates  were  numerically  lower  with  the  30  mg  regimen  as 
compared to the 60 mg treatment. Therefore, the CHMP agrees that where the risk of bleeding events 
outweighs the risk of ischaemic strokes and SEEs the 30 mg QD dose might be an option. This could 
be  the  case  for  patients  with  a  low  CHADS2  score  and/or  patients  with  contraindications  for  VKA 
therapy. However, no data comparing low dose edoxaban e.g. with aspirin or aspirin/clopidogrel are 
available for patients with contraindications for VKA therapy and the issue could not be answered 
within this procedure;  
e) Overall, the number of strokes, SEE and particular disabling strokes was higher in the 30 mg QD 
group as compared to warfarin, but the number of fatal strokes was lower. Haemorrhagic strokes are 
more likely to be fatal than ischaemic strokes.  In the edoxaban 60 mg group  more haemorrhagic 
strokes occurred and haemorrhagic strokes were even more likely to be fatal than in the edoxaban 30 
mg group. The net effect was a lower rate of disabling strokes (53 vs. 81) in the 60 mg group at the 
expense of a higher rate of fatal strokes (79 vs. 73). In about 7000 patients 81 additional strokes, of 
these 28 disabling strokes, could be prevented at the cost of 6 additional fatal strokes with the 60 mg 
compared to the 30 mg dose;  
f) The event rate in the edoxaban group decreased with increasing TTR INR. The Applicant provided 
a  potential  explanation  to  this  observation.  On  one  hand,  a  better  center  specific  INR  control  for 
warfarin may indicate a better overall level of care that is per se associated with a lower event rate in 
the  edoxaban  group.  Such  factors  may  contribute  to  the  association  between  outcome  in  the 
edoxaban  group  and  control  of  INR  values  in  the  warfarin  group.  In  addition,  center  specific 
characteristics of patients included influenced INR control on one hand and the outcome on the other 
hand. e.g. center specific previous VKA use and region were highly correlated with INR control and 
may be relevant for the outcome.  
g) For edoxaban 60 mg group, non-inferiority vs. warfarin can be assumed at least for those patients 
with TTR INR up to about 74%. However, for the highest quartile, the point estimate of the HR was in 
favour of warfarin (1.07; 95%CI: 0.65, 1.75). The data support the impression that non-inferiority of 
efficacy of edoxaban 60 mg vs. warfarin is questionable for those centers with optimal warfarin INR 
control. Ischaemic strokes, ischaemic strokes or SEE and all strokes + SEE were numerically in favour 
of warfarin in the highest quartile group. For bleeding events, MACE, MI and “net clinical outcome” the 
event rates were largely similar and the rate of haemorrhagic strokes and CV deaths were numerically 
in favour of edoxaban. INR control may relate to two factors: I) general level of medical support and 
II) patient characteristics that may not be changeable. Albeit the primary statistical analysis was not 
based  on  quartiles  of  INR  control,  for  individual  treatment  decisions  it  was  agreed  to  briefly 
summarize the key data per quartile in the SmPC to provide reassurance to the physician that no 
benefit can be expected by switching a well controlled patient on warfarin to edoxaban.

2.5.3.3.  HOKUSAI VTE: Treatment of VTE including DVT and PE, and prevention of 
recurrent VTE 
The efficacy and safety of edoxaban in reducing the risk of symptomatic recurrent VTE in subjects with 
documented acute symptomatic DVT and/or PE is primarily based upon the large Phase 3 Hokusai VTE 
study in which 4118 subjects were treated with edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg reduced) and 4122 with 
warfarin  for  3-12  months  (all  patients  received  heparin-based  initial  treatment  for  5-12  days). 
Hokusai VTE was Phase 3, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, matching placebo, 
parallel-group, non-inferiority study to evaluate the benefits and risks of edoxaban in reducing the 
risk of symptomatic recurrent VTE in subjects with documented acute symptomatic DVT and/or PE. At 
least 40% of subjects had to present with PE. 
•  Dosing in the experimental group in HOKUSAI-VTE 
HOKUSAI-VTE enrolled male or female adult subjects with symptomatic DVT and/or PE documented 
by  objective  methods.  In  HOKUSAI-VTE,  eligible  subjects  were  randomized  to  (LMW) 
heparin/edoxaban  or  (LMW)  heparin/warfarin  using  stratified  randomization.  All  patients  received 
initial therapy with open-label enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin for at least 5 days. Edoxaban or 
warfarin  was  administered  in  a  double-blind,  double-dummy  fashion.  Edoxaban  (or  placebo)  was 
started after discontinuation of initial heparin. Edoxaban was administered at a dose of 60 mg orally 
once daily, taken with or without food, or at a dose of 30 mg once daily in patients with a creatinine 
clearance of 30 to 50 ml per minute or a body weight of 60 kg or less or in patients who were receiving 
concomitant  treatment  with  potent  P-glycoprotein  inhibitors.  Dosing  in  the  experimental  group 
(heparin  lead-in  followed  by  edoxaban)  was  similar  to  the  dosing  selected  for  dabigatran  trials  in 
acute VTE (RE-COVER I and II), but different from the single drug approach (no need for heparin 
lead-in, using higher doses of the new anticoagulant during the first weeks and followed by a lower 
maintenance dose) used in rivaroxaban trials (EINSTEIN DVT and PE) and apixaban pivotal trial in 
acute VTE (AMPLIFY). This was considered to be an important difference in dosing between edoxaban 
and the other Factor Xa inhibitors. Consequently, a statement was included in section 4.2 of the SmPC 
that Lixiana is to be started following initial use of a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. 
•  Treatment duration in HOKUSAI-VTE 
Study duration was left to the investigator. Although it was endorsed that this approach may mimic 
standard practice, it would be preferable to plan for a second randomisation, or a second study in 
patients having received anticoagulation after 3-6 months, in order to generate randomised clinical 
data  versus  placebo  or  active  comparator  in  the  setting  of  extended  treatment  of  VTE  (i.e.:  as 
conducted in the EINSTEIN-ext with rivaroxaban, RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE study with dabigatran or 
the  AMPLIFY-ext  study  with  apixaban).  However,  the  design  and  analysis  (mITT  Overall  versus 
On-Treatment)  of  the  study  allowed  for  assessment  of  the  extension  of  therapy/the  secondary 
prevention of VTE without the need for a formal “extension” study. Furthermore this “extension” study 
within  Hokusai  was  performed  with  an  active  comparator-warfarin  rather  than  placebo  allowing  a 
more robust comparison as to the real world risk benefit if continued therapy. As such the indication 
for  both  the  active  treatment  of  acute  VTE  and  secondary  prevention  of  recurrent  VTE  were 
demonstrated with the Hokusai VTE study with up to 12 months of therapy. Therefore, it is agreed 
that  a  separate  "extension"  study  is  not  warranted.  The  Kaplan-Meier  curves  of  recurrent  VTE 
provided further support that continued exposure, remaining on therapy (on treatment versus overall 
population)  is  associated  with  decreased  recurrence  and  both  analyses  (on  treatment  and  overall 
population)  favored  edoxaban  versus  warfarin.  The  main  issue  during  HOKUSAI-VTE  regarding 
duration of therapy, looking at post-treatment recurrences, is that it seems that many patients would 
have benefited from longer treatment durations of anticoagulation. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier 
curves  are  linear  data  and  there  is  long-term  safety  data  from  ENGAGE  AF.  Due  to  the  above 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 102/138 
  
  
 
 
 
mentioned reasons, it was agreed not to limit the duration of treatment of VTE to 1 year tested with 
edoxaban in HOKUSAI-VTE.  
Optimal treatment duration with edoxaban after acute VTE is unclear. According to clinical practice 
guidelines,  the  duration  of  therapy  for  treatment  of  VTE  including  DVT  and  PE,  and  prevention  of 
recurrent VTE should be individualised after careful assessment of the treatment benefit against the 
risk for bleeding. Short duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk 
factors  (e.g.  recent  surgery,  trauma,  immobilisation)  and  longer  durations  should  be  based  on 
permanent risk factors or idiopathic DVT or PE. This information was included in the SmPC. 
The HOKUSAI-VTE study used a double-blind design, which is in line of the one used in the recent 
RE-COVER  studies  with  dabigatran  and  AMPLIFY  study  with  apixaban  (EINSTEIN  studies  with 
rivaroxaban followed an open-label design). HOKUSAI-VTE study was stratified by: (1) diagnosis at 
presentation (PE and DVT only), (2) baseline risk factors (temporary risk factors vs. all others), and 
(3)  need  for  edoxaban  dose  reduction  to  30  mg  (yes,  no).  The  primary  efficacy  outcome  in 
HOKUSAI-VTE was symptomatic recurrent VTE (i.e., the composite of DVT, non-fatal PE, and fatal 
PE).  The  applicant  confirmed  that  approximately  8%  of  primary  efficacy  events  were  adjudicated 
events without confirmatory imaging. These events mainly included VTE-related deaths. However, 
the events were equally distributed in both groups and sensitivity analysis excluding these events 
(HR: 0.90: 95%CI: 0.69-1.16) yielded very similar results than the main analysis (HR: 0.89; 95%CI: 
0.70-1.13), thus supporting non-inferiority of edoxaban under different assumptions. 
•  Statistical considerations in HOKUSAI-VTE  
HOKUSAI-VTE  was  event  driven  study.  A  total  of  at  least  220  events  were  required.  Sample  size 
calculation was endorsed. The primary efficacy analysis of the HOKUSAI-VTE study was based on a 
modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set (subjects who are randomized and received at least one 
dose of study drug) using all primary efficacy events (symptomatic recurrent VTE) that occurred in 
the 12-month study period. The time to the first event of the composite primary efficacy outcome was 
analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model including treatment and the stratification factors as 
covariates. The experimental regime was considered non-inferior to the comparator if the upper limit 
of  the  95%CI  for  the  HR  was  less  than  1.5.  The  non-inferiority  margin  (HR  <1.50)  is  the  most 
restrictive  one compared  to  recent  studies  with  novel  oral  anticoagulants  in  the  treatment  of  VTE 
(1.80 in AMPLIFY; 2.0 in EINSTEIN studies; 2.75 in RE-COVER studies).  
•  Study conduct 
A  total  of  8292  subjects  were  randomized  and  assigned  to  the  edoxaban  (N=4143)  or  warfarin 
(N=4149) treatment groups, and a total of 8240 subjects were treated with edoxaban (N=4118) or 
warfarin (N=4122) (mITT set). There was no screening period in Hokusai VTE, which is consistent 
with the acute and serious nature of the event to be treated. The critical study qualification work-up 
was  conducted  outside  of  the  study  as  a  matter  of  routine  for  the  management  of  VTE.  These 
procedures were deemed acceptable if done within 48 hours before randomization. Of the 8,240 mITT 
subjects, 65 (0.8%) subjects withdrew consent and 11 (0.1%) were lost to follow up. Major protocol 
deviations were reported in 23% of patients (Table 14.1.2.1 of the HOKUSAI-VTE study report). Most 
of them (16%) corresponded to the use of disallowed medications (mainly disallowed NSAIDs) that 
impacts the evaluation of main efficacy/safety endpoints, followed by pretreatment for more than 48 
hours with therapeutic dosages of anticoagulant treatment before randomisation (4%). The applicant 
was  requested  to  show  the  main  efficacy/safety  analyses,  on-treatment,  conducting  a  “pure” 
per-protocol analysis (i.e.: excluding the 23% of patients with major protocol deviations, in addition 
to those already excluded for not having a baseline VTE event confirmed by the CEC). In the revised 
"true" PP analysis (excluding all major protocol violations) there were 3116 patients on edoxaban and 
3143 patients on warfarin. The HR of edoxaban versus warfarin for recurrent VTE was 0.95 (0.68 to 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 103/138 
  
  
 
 
 
 
1.33;  treatment+30  days),  thus  confirming  non-inferiority  (p-value  0.0040).  In  summary,  the 
original  PP  analysis  of  the  applicant  (not  excluding  all  major  protocol  violations)  favoured  the 
demonstration  of  non-inferiority  of  edoxaban  versus  warfarin  in  efficacy.  However,  non-inferiority 
was also demonstrated after conducting a "true" PP analysis (excluding all major protocol violations). 
Only 11 patients (0.1%) were lost to follow-up. However, a total of 24 patients (16 patients in the 
edoxaban group and only 8 patients from warfarin group) were excluded at sites for which subject 
data  authenticity  was  suspect  and  could  not  be  confirmed.  Ancillary  analyses  provided  by  the 
Applicant supported in conclusion that the inclusion/exclusion of these patients did not change study 
results. Approximately 17% of subjects required the 30 mg edoxaban at randomization due to body 
weight ≤ 60 kg (10%), CrCL 30-50 mL/min (4%), or for the use of quinidine/verapamil (0.5%). Post- 
randomization requirement for 30 mg edoxaban/edoxaban placebo occurred in 123 subjects (68 for 
edoxaban  and  55  for  edoxaban  placebo  (active  warfarin),  respectively.  Approximately  17.6%  of 
subjects had their dose adjusted at randomization. Approximately 8% of the dose reductions were 
due to concomitant medication with P-gp inhibitors.  
•  Main study results 
Non-inferiority  of  edoxaban  60  mg  was  shown  in  the  primary  sponsor’s  analysis  of  symptomatic 
recurrent  VTE  (mITT,  overall  study  period)  as  well  as  in  the  sensitivity  analysis  for  symptomatic 
recurrent  VTE  (PP,  on-treatment),  but  superiority  was  not  shown  for  the  secondary  endpoint  of 
symptomatic recurrent VTE and all-cause death (mITT, overall study period. In addition, there was a 
huge  difference  in  the  number  of  VTE  events  “on-treatment”  and  “overall  study  period” 
(approximately half of total primary events occurred post-treatment). 
Net clinical outcome (composite of symptomatic recurrent DVT, nonfatal symptomatic recurrent PE, 
Major bleeding, and All-cause mortality) occurred in 138 subjects (3.4%) in the edoxaban group and 
158 subjects (3.9%) in the warfarin group (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.696, 1.099; p = 0.2515). However, 
these results correspond to a secondary PP analysis on-treatment, and not to the main analysis in the 
mITT, overall study period. For the shake of consistency, the applicant was requested to show the 
results of net clinical outcome in HOKUSAI-VTE using the same approach as in the main analysis of the 
primary endpoint (i.e.: in the mITT population, overall study period). The HR and 95% CIs for the net 
clinical outcome using this approach (HR: 1.00; 95%CI: 0.85-1.18) suggest that both edoxaban and 
warfarin (both with lead in parenteral anticoagulant) are equivalent strategies for VTE treatment. The 
SmPC, section 5.1, has been amended accordingly. 
•  Subgroup analyses 
The  efficacy  of  edoxaban  was  generally  consistent  across  subgroups  tested  in  the  HOKUSAI-VTE 
study. Overall, of the 55 comparisons presented from 18 subgroup analyses, most (45) resulted in a 
point estimate favouring edoxaban. Statistically significant interaction was only found for fragile vs. 
non-fragile patients. Edoxaban effect was better in fragile than in non-fragile patients. In general, the 
effects of edoxaban were also better (although not statistically significant interaction was found) in 
index PE, age > 75 years and history of cancer, which was reassuring. Regarding the quality of oral 
anticoagulation, the edoxaban group had a relative reduction in risk for recurrent VTE compared to 
warfarin for subjects at centers TTR < 60% (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.574, 1.364) and also at centers with 
TTR ≥60% (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.653, 1.153). The Hazard Ratio for the edoxaban group for centers 
with INR-TTR >55.8 ≤64.0% was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.496, 1.205).  
•  DMS, SMCC, and CEC 
DMS, SMCC, and CEC: The large difference between peak and trough values and the close relation 
between plasma concentration and factor Xa activity raiseed a question, whether a lower dose bid 
dose (e.g. 15 or 20 mg BID) would have been preferable over a qd dosing. However, it may not be 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015

possible to draw final conclusions from the phase 3 Hokusai VTE study, whether a lower bid dose 
adapted to a similar overall duration of suppression of FXa activity to 15% or less would have changed 
the B/R ratio. The DMC but not the SMCC had access to INR measurements that could have led to 
partial unblinding. A high risk patient that dies due to any reason will not have an index event of the 
primary  endpoint.  The  applicant  provided  a  competing  risk  analysis  upon  request  with  non-VTE 
related deaths as competing risk. The overall result was similar to the result of the primary analysis 
and did not change the conclusions.  
• 
Transition between LMW heparin and edoxaban treatment  
The excess of index recurrent VTE events in the edoxaban group during the first 30 days raised a 
question, whether the transition between LMW heparin and edoxaban treatment could be improved 
(intensified to achieve a more potent anticoagulation; e.g. by an overlapping treatment initiation with 
a reduced dose or an initial parenteral therapy longer than 5 days). However, subgroup analyses did 
not show a consistent better efficacy in patients initially treated with LMWH for more than 5 days than 
in those treated for 5 days or less. Therefore, the recommended posology (Lixiana 60 mg once daily 
following initial use of parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days) was considered acceptable.  
• 
Possibility of a rebound effect 
There was a slight increase in recurrent VTE rates in the edoxaban group after Day 360, especially 
after Day 390. This is mainly due to the low number of subjects at these timepoints. The change in the 
curve after Day 390 in the edoxaban group is due to 3 events which occurred after the subjects had 
stopped study drug. The data do not indicate a general rebound effect on MACE or VTE events after 
cessation of edoxaban. 
•  Asymptomatic patients with DVT 
Asymptomatic patients with DVT (e.g. with malignant disease) were not included in the study. The 
transferability of Hokusai VTE to patients with asymptomatic DVT is difficult to establish. However, as 
the indication should include the population studied in pivotal trials (symptomatic patients only, in 
Hokusai VTE) and on the other hand, asymptomatic patients with incidental extensive thrombosis are 
usually anticoagulated according to established clinical practice guidelines (Kearon et al. Chest. 2012; 
141(2 Suppl): e419S-e494S), there is no reason to include in the SmPC neither a recommendation or 
a non-recommendation of use in asymptomatic patients with VTE. 
2.5.3.4.  Both pivotal studies 
Only few black patients were included in both pivotal trials. The sparse data do not indicate concerns 
for efficacy and safety but the low number of black patients included in the studies has been reflected 
in the SmPC.  
Cox’s  proportional  hazards  model  was  used  for  primary  analysis  of  the  pivotal  trials  for  both 
indications, which assumes a constant HR over time. The applicant provided further clarifications that 
were accepted by the CHMP.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In NVAF, the ENGAGE AF study provided evidence of non-inferiority for edoxaban 60 mg QD versus 
warfarin for the composite of all strokes and SEE (primary endpoint recommended in SA) and for the 
composite  of  ischemic  strokes  and  SEE  (primary  endpoint  recommended  currently  in  the  EMA 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for prevention of stroke and systemic embolic 
events  in  patients  with  NVAF  [EMA/CHMP/341363/2014]).  On  the  contrary,  although  the  low 
edoxaban  dose  (30  mg  QD)  showed  non-inferiority  versus  warfarin  for  all  strokes/SEE  (study 
endpoint),  it  was  inferior  to  warfarin  for  the  composite  of  ischemic  stroke/SEE.  Therefore,  the 
Assessment report

Applicant's proposal of recommending the edoxaban 60 mg dose for prevention of stroke and SEE in 
patients with NVAF was endorsed.  
The effect of edoxaban 60 mg dose was consistent in most subgroups analysed. However, stroke/SEE 
rates tended to favour warfarin in patients recruited in Western Europe and those with normal renal 
function.  The  interpretation  of  the  results  in  Western  Europe  was  hampered  by  the  limitations  of 
subgroup  analyses  and  the  low  event  rates.  These  regional  variations  in  the  context  of  the 
heterogeneous countries of EEA region were discussed by the CHMP, and the CHMP took also into 
account that ENGAGE AF demonstrated non-inferiority of edoxaban 60 mg versus a well-controlled 
warfarin regime in the overall population. All-cause mortality and CV mortality were broadly similar in 
the overall vs. on-treatment analysis in both the edoxaban and warfarin groups in Western Europe, 
with point estimates of HR close to 1. Therefore, no safety signal was apparent in Western Europe. In 
addition,  when  the  analysis  was  made  in  the  region  of  the  EEA  and  Switzerland,  the  results  on 
ischemic stroke/SEE were broadly similar in the edoxaban and warfarin groups (HR 0.94 and 0.99 
point estimates in the overall study period and on-treatment analyses, respectively). In summary, 
although the hazard ratios for the on-treatment and overall periods may show some variability, given 
in excess of 100 combinations of regions and endpoints this minor level of inconsistency in ischemic 
stroke/SEE  was  considered  to  be  due  a  combination  of  chance  due  to  the  extreme  multiplicity  of 
testing  and  a  trend  towards  a  better  control  of  warfarin  treatment  in  Western  Europe  and 
North-America than in other regions. The overal study results were deemed hence representative for 
the EEA. 
A positive B/R in patients with AF and normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 80 mL/min) was  questioned 
and extensively discussed but at the end considered positive across the continuum of renal function at 
the population level. More than 2000 patients were included in each arm in this analysis, there was 
consistency over a wide range of efficacy endpoints, the results were essentially consistent in the 
60/30 mg arm and in the 30/15 mg arm, INR control in the warfarin arm was independent of renal 
function, there was external support since the event rates on edoxaban in ENGAGE AF were higher as 
compared to the event rates in the respective warfarin arms in additional 2 out of 3 studies, there was 
replication  since  also  in  Hokusai  VTE  there  was  a  clear  correlation  between  renal  function  and 
comparative  efficacy  with  a  HR  numerically  in  favour  of  warfarin  in  patients  with  normal  renal 
function.  Taken  all  these  considerations  together  and  balancing  the  apparent  robustness  of  the 
findings for the clinical endpoints on one hand and the fact that PK considerations cannot entirely 
explain the findings on the other hand, the level of concern remained high enough to make prescribing 
physicians clearly aware of the signal in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, a warning was 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC that a trend towards decreasing efficacy with increasing creatinine 
clearance  was  observed  for  edoxaban  compared  to  well-managed  warfarin.  Therefore,  edoxaban 
should only be used in patients with NVAF and high creatinine clearance after a careful evaluation of 
the individual thromboembolic and bleeding risk. 
In the treatment of acute VTE, HOKUSAI VTE provided evidence of non-inferiority of edoxaban 60 mg 
versus  warfarin  (both  regimes  preceded  by  heparin  lead-in  treatment).  The  non-inferiority  was 
consistent  in  the  ITT  and  PP  populations,  as  well  as  in  the  on-treatment  and  overall  study  period 
analysis. No specific VTE extension studies have been conducted with edoxaban. However, the design 
and  analysis  of  the  study  allowed  the  applicant  to  assess  extension  of  therapy/the  secondary 
prevention of VTE without the need for a formal “extension” study. Furthermore this “extension” study 
within  Hokusai  was  performed  with  an  active  comparator-warfarin  rather  than  placebo  allowing  a 
more robust comparison as to the real world risk benefit if continued therapy. As such the indication 
for  both  the  active  treatment  of  acute  VTE  and  secondary  prevention  of  recurrent  VTE  were 
demonstrated with the Hokusai VTE study with up to 12 months of therapy. The main issue during 
HOKUSAI-VTE  regarding  duration  of  therapy,  looking  at  post-treatment  recurrences,  was  that  it 
seems that many patients would benefit from longer treatment durations of anticoagulation. That is 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 106/138 
  
  
 
why it was agreed not to limit the duration of treatment of VTE to the 1 year tested with edoxaban in 
HOKUSAI-VTE.  
During pivotal studies, dose reductions were made in patients concomitantly receiving P-gp inhibitors. 
However,  the  totality  of  the  data  did  not  support  diminishing  the  dose  when  edoxaban  60  mg  is 
concomitantly  administered  with  verapamil,  quinidine  or  amiodarone.  However  in  patients 
concomitantly  taking  edoxaban  and  the  following  P-gp  inhibitors:  ciclosporine,  dronedarone, 
erythromycin, or ketoconazole, the recommended dose is 30mg of edoxaban once daily. 
Finally, the applicant’s intention for applying for the authorisation of the 15 mg QD was endorsed but 
restricted to the process of switching from edoxaban to VKA for patients currently on edoxaban 30 
mg. The information in the SmPC has been amended to reflect more accurately the switching process 
used in ENGAGE-AF study. An additional warning was included in the SmPC to prevent from treatment 
with suboptimal 15 mg dose in monotherapy and to make clear that the 15 mg dose is only indicated 
in  the  process  of  switching  from  edoxaban  30  mg  to  VKA  (patients  with  presumed  increased 
exposure), together with an appropriate VKA dose. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Exposure:  The  exposure  in  the  Pooled  Phase  3  studies  amounts  to  18,010  patients  treated  with 
edoxaban for approximately 1.9 years (more than 34000 subject-years for edoxaban: approximately 
18200 subject-years for edoxaban 60 mg and 15800 subject-years for edoxaban 30 mg) and and 
11,010  patients  treated  with  warfarin  for  approximately  1.7  years  (approximately  18350 
subject-years).  
Table S-01: Numbers of Subjects in Analysis Sets in Phase 3 Studies 
Exposure  to  treatment  in  ENGAGE  AF  dominates  the  total  exposure,  with  total  subject-years  of 
treatment of >15400 being accumulated on each of edoxaban 30 mg, edoxaban 60 mg and warfarin 
in  this  NVAF  study.  The  subjects  in  ENGAGE  AF  and  Hokusai  VTE  were  enrolled  globally. 
Approximately half of the subjects were recruited from Europe (Eastern and Western). Total exposure 
to edoxaban is approximately 1.7 times as high in males as in females and more than twice as high in 
subjects  aged  over  65  years  than  in  younger  subjects.  These  differences  in  exposure  are  largely 
accounted for by the dominant ENGAGE AF dataset, which comprised a notably older population than 
the Hokusai VTE set. An appreciable number of patients aged >75 years (edoxaban 6153 vs warfarin 
3319) and >85 years (edoxaban 661 vs warfarin 374) were included in the pooled phase III trials. The 
available exposure to edoxaban is deemed appropriate for the assessment of frequent adverse events 
in the target population.

The number of overall AEs and patients with at least one AE was initialy unknown as the applicant has 
only shown disaggregated data of “bleeding” and “non-bleeding AEs”. The applicant provided during 
the procedure summarized tables of overall adverse events (not disagreggated into “bleeding” and 
“non-bleeding” adverse events), showing: total adverse events and patients with at least one adverse 
event; serious and non-serious AEs; related and not related AEs) in the pooled phase III trials and by 
trial. The rate of patients with TEAEs/SAEs as well as drug-related TEAEs/SAEs favoured edoxaban in 
most categories, in both pivotal studies, separately and pooled, thus indicating a better safety profile 
of edoxaban in comparison with warfarin. 
Adverse events 
Overall  adverse  events  in  ENGAGE-AF  (NVAF  indication):  A  summary  of  overall  TEAEs  is 
provided in the following table, which includes bleeding events, hepatic events, bone fractures, and 
malignancies. The rates of patients with TEAE/SAE were lower with edoxaban than with warfarin for 
most categories and similar for TEAE that caused drug permanent discontinuation.

TEAEs is provided in the following table, all of which include bleeding events, hepatic events, bone 
Fractures,  malignancies  and  Investigator-confirmed  endpoint  events.  The  rates  of  patients  with 
TEAE/SAE  were  lower  with  edoxaban  than  with  warfarin  for  most  categories  and  similar  for  TEAE 
leading to fatal outcome and TEAT that caused drug permanent discontinuation.

Bleeding events in ENGAGE-AF (NVAF indication): The risk of bleeding was lower for edoxaban 
60 mg than warfarin for all categories. HR were below 1 and p values showed the reductions to be 
highly statistically significant: major bleeds (HR 0.80, p=0.009), fatal bleeds (HR 0.55, p=0.0059), 
non-fatal (HR 0.83, p=0.0087), life-threatening (HR 0.51, p < 0.0001), CRNM (HR 0.86, p=0.0001),

major or CRNM (HR 0.86, p < 0.0001), minor (HR 0.84, p=0.0023) and any confirmed bleed (HR 
0.87, p < 0.0001). The lower risk of major intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was particularly marked (HR 
0.47, p < 0.0001). A dose-response was apparent for edoxaban, as the rates of adjudicated bleeds 
were even lower with edoxaban 30 mg than with edoxaban 60 mg, but this advantage with regard to 
bleeding is offset by the notably lower efficacy of this dose (30 mg OD).  
Table  S-04:  Adjudicated  Bleeding  Events,  Safety  Analysis  Set  –  On-Treatment  Period 
(ENGAGE AF) 
Major bleeding was lower in most locations in the edoxaban groups compared with the warfarin group. 
However, there were more Major GI bleeds in the edoxaban 60 mg group than in the warfarin group 
(1.51% and 1.23% per year, respectively).

Adjudicated CRNM bleeding was also lower in most locations in the edoxaban groups than the warfarin 
group. However, again there was more CRNM GI bleeds in the edoxaban 60 mg OD group than in the 
warfarin group (2.17% and 1.31% per year, respectively).  
Table S-06: Adjudicated Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding by Treatment Group and 
Location, Safety Analysis Set – On-Treatment Period 
The benefit in overall major bleeding risk was consistent in most subgroups analysed, particularly in 
fragile patients with renal insufficiency, age > 75 yrs or body weight < 60 kg. However, there was no 
difference between edoxaban 60 mg and warfarin with regard to overall major bleeds when warfarin 
treatment is optimally managed (i.e.: in centers with TTR > 66.4% or in the 4th quartile of INR/TTR), 
which is the rule in many European centers.

Bleeding  events  in  HOKUSAI-VTE:  In  Hokusai  VTE,  the  reduction  in  bleeding  risk  was  highly 
significant for Major/CRNM bleeding (8.5% VS. 10.3%; HR 0.81; 95%CI: 0.71-0.94; p=0.0040) but 
not for major bleeds (1.4% vs. 1.6%; HR: 0.84; 0.59-1.21; p=0.3521). There were fewer critical site 
Major/CRNM bleeds on edoxaban than warfarin treatment (13 vs. 32), fewer intracranial bleeds in the 
edoxaban group than the warfarin group (5 vs. 18) and fewer fatal bleeds (2 vs. 10). It seems that the 
more important benefit of edoxaban, as with other new anticoagulants, is the reduction in ICH.  
Table S-09: Adjudicated Bleeding Events, Safety Analysis Set – On-Treatment Period 
(Hokusai VTE) 
On the contrary, there was an increase in major/CRNMB associated with a fall in hemoglobin > 2 g/dL 
(40 vs. 33) and needing a transfusion ≥ 2 units (28 vs. 22), which was mainly due to an increase in 
“mucosal  bleedings”,  including  major/CRNM  gastrointestinal  bleedings  (2.4%  in  edoxaban  group 
versus 2.3% of warfarin group) and vaginal bleeds (4.6% in the edoxaban group versus 3.2% in the 
warfarin group).

Table  S-10:  Adjudicated  Major  or  Clinically  Relevant  Non-Major  Bleeding  Event 
Characteristics: Safety Analysis Set – On-Treatment Period (Hokusai VTE) 
When all adjudicated confirmed bleeds were considered, gastrointestinal bleeds were recorded for 
4.2%  and  3.6%  in  the  edoxaban  and  warfarin  groups,  respectively,  with  the  majority  of  these 
affecting the lower GI tract (3.4% and 3.1% of subjects in each treatment group). The incidence of all 
vaginal  bleeds  was  9.0%  for  edoxaban  and  7.1%  for  warfarin.  The  increase  in  GI  bleedings  with 
edoxaban 60 mg OD was consistent with the increase in risk of GI bleeding seen in the ENGAGE-AF 
study  and  the  results  obtained  with  other  NOAC.  The  higher  rate  of  occurrence  of  vaginal  bleeds 
(mainly menorrhagia) in this study compared with ENGAGE AF may be a reflection of the younger age 
of  the  population.  The  benefit  in  major  bleeding  risk  was  consistent  in  most  subgroups  analysed, 
particularly in fragile patients with renal insufficiency, age > 75 yrs or body weight < 60 kg. However, 
there was no difference between edoxaban 60 mg and warfarin with regard to MB/CRNMB bleeds at 
centres  with  TTR  >  60%  (HR:  0.91;  95%  CI:  0.770,  1.077),  which  is  the  rule  in  many  European 
centers, and in centers with TTR >70.41% (HR: 1.06; 95%CI: 0.79 to 1.44).

Ancillary analyses of bleeding events across studies 
Intracranial  hemorrhage  (ICH):  Ancillary  analyses  provided  by  the  Applicant  showed  that  the 
benefits of edoxaban versus warfarin in ICH were consistent in the worst case (high TTR and Western 
European population). It was consistent with results observed with other NOACs. The class benefit 
seems to be driven by an intrinsically risk of ICH with VKAs, which is seen even at high TTR. The

absolute benefit of edoxaban versus warfarin is difficult to establish due to low number of events, but 
could be around 3 ICH avoided per 1,000 patients treated per year in the European AF population 
(edoxaban  3  ICH  vs  warfarin  6  ICH/1,000/yr).  In  the  overall  ENGAGE  AF  study  population,  the 
projected  benefit  is  around  5  ICH  per  1,000  patients  treated  (edoxaban  4  ICH  vs.  warfarin  9 
ICH/1,000/yr). In the overall Hokusai VTE study population, the absolute benefit of edoxaban versus 
warfarin  in  ICH  may  be  similar,  around  3  ICH  avoided  per  1,000  patients  treated  for  acute  VTE 
(edoxaban 1 ICH/1,000 vs. warfarin 4 ICH/1,000),  but difficult to establish due to low number of 
events and shorter durations of treatment (usually lasting less than 1 year).  
Baseline  characteristics  of  patients  with  major  bleeding:  Patients  who  experienced  major 
bleedings  had  older  age,  higher  proportion  of  renal  impairment  and  concomitant  ASA  use  than 
patients  without  major  bleedings.  These  patients  were  more  represented  in  ENGAGE  AF  than  in 
Hokusai  VTE.  In  both  ENGAGE  AF  and  Hokusai  VTE,  demographic  characteristics  in  subjects  with 
adjudicated  major  bleeds  were  generally  comparable  between  treatment  groups,  except  for 
concomitant aspirin use in Hokusai VTE which was higher in the edoxaban than the warfarin group.  
Clinical  management  of  major  bleeding:  In  ENGAGE  AF  the  rate  of  patients  needing 
hospitalization  for  major  bleeding  was  less  frequent  in  edoxaban  than  in  warfarin  in  ENGAGE  AF 
(1.54%/yr vs 1.81%/yr), transfusion ≥ 2 units was similar (1.05%/yr in both groups), as well as need 
for surgery (0.20%/yr vs  0.29%/yr). Hospitalization with intensive care was lower with edoxaban 
(0.7%/yr  vs  1.4%/yr).  In  Hokusai  VTE,  the  rate  of  patients  requiring  hospitalization  for  major 
bleeding (1.2% vs. 1.2%), transfusion ≥ 2 units (0.7% vs 0.5%), need for surgery (<0.1 vs < 0.1% 
and  hospitalization  with  inensive  care  unit  (0.3  vs  0.4%)  was  generally  comparable  between 
edoxaban and warfarin treatment groups.  
Major bleeding outcomes: there was lower 30-day all-cause mortality after major bleeding in the 
edoxaban  60-mg  than  the  warfarin  group  (ENGAGE  AF:  0.5%  vs.  1.0%;  Hokusai  VTE:  0.1%  vs. 
0.3%). Major bleed outcome of resolved with sequelae was lower with edoxaban than with warfarin in 
ENGAGE AF (0.7% vs 1.2%), but not in Hokusai VTE (0.2% vs. 0.1%). 
Major  and  CRNM  GI  bleeding:  In  ENGAGE  AF,  edoxaban  60-mg  subjects  had  a  higher  rate  of 
Major/CRNM  GI  bleed  than  warfarin  subjects  (3.54%/yr  vs.  2.42%/yr),  including  those  requiring 
hospitalization  (1.61%/yr  vs.  1.27%/yr)  and  transfusion  (0.97%/yr  vs.  0.84%/yr).  However,  the 
more  severe  bleedings,  resulting  in  death  of  hospitalisation  in  intensive  care  unit,  are  more often 
reported with warfarin than with edoxaban. The increase in GI bleedings (HR≈ 1.46) mimic those 
reported  with  dabigatran  150  mg  BID  in  RE-LY  study  (HR:  1.52)  and  rivaroxaban  20  mg  OD  in 
ROCKET AF (HR ≈ 1.26) for CRNM GI bleed. Further SmPC changes in sections 4.4 and 4.8 have been 
included to warn about this increase in risk. 
Common  non-bleeding  TEAEs  (pooled  Phase  III  trials):  Comparison  of  total  edoxaban  and 
edoxaban 60 mg with warfarin revealed only small differences in incidence for the majority of events 
(Pooled  Phase  3  studies).  However,  anaemia  was  reported  for  a  higher  proportion  of  edoxaban 
subjects (4.2%) than warfarin subjects (2.9%). Gastrointestinal TEAEs (diarrhoea, nausea, gastritis 
and dyspepsia) was also reported for a higher proportion of edoxaban subjects than warfarin subjects 
(6.3% vs 6% for diarrhoea; 3.4% vs. 2.8% for nausea; 2.1% vs. 1.9% for gastritis and 1.8% vs. 
1.6% for dyspepsia, respectively). The most notable difference was for INR increased which was, as 
anticipated, much more common on warfarin than edoxaban treatment (4.7% compared with 0.5%). 
Treatment-related  non-bleeding  TEAEs:  In  the  Pooled  Phase  3  studies,  treatment-related 
non-bleeding  TEAEs  were  recorded  for  11.6%  of  the  edoxaban  60  mg  group  and  14.6%  of  the

warfarin group over the modified on-treatment period. “Anaemia” and “hepatic enzyme increased” 
was more frequent in edoxaban 60 mg group than in the edoxaban 30 mg group or warfarin group 
(anemia: 0.9% versus 0.8% and 0.6%) (hepatic enzyme increased: 0.8% vs. 0.2% and 0.6%). 
Table S-13: Common Treatment-related Non-Bleeding TEAEs in ≥0.5% of Subjects in 
Pooled ENGAGE AF and Hokusai VTE Studies: Safety Analysis Set; Modified On-Treatment 
Period 
Hepatic safety: There was a small imbalance against edoxaban 60 mg versus warfarin (pooled 
phase 3 studies) in: a) the cases of hyperbilirubinaemia (edoxaban 60 mg 0.3% vs warfarin 0.1%); b) 
in concurrent elevation of ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN & Total Bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN (edoxaban 60 mg 0.4% 
vs warfarin 0.3%, corresponding to 43 and 29 cases, respectively; Pooled Phase 3 trials); c) In the 
percentage of subjects in the edoxaban 60 mg group versus warfarin that were characterized by an 
independent hepatologist as having a hepatocellular injury (1.1% vs. 1.0%, respectively); d) In the 
percentage of cases of liver injury possible/probable related to study drug [(edoxaban 60 mg 0.4% 
(48 of 11008 subjects) versus warfarin 0.3% (30 of 11010 subjects)]; e) in the percentage of liver 
injury adjudicated as severe (edoxaban 60 mg 0.4% vs warfarin 0.3%); f) and in the number of Hy’s 
law cases adjudicated as severe hepatocellular liver injury possibly/probably related to study drug 
(edoxaban any dose 2 vs warfarin 1), which is of concern. A similar concern has been arisen with other 
factor Xa inhibitors. A definitive association between these novel oral factor Xa inhibitors and risk of 
hepatic injury has not been definitively confirmed. 
Hepatic  events:  All  suspected  hepatic  events  were  blindly  adjudicated  by  two  hepatologists 
independently. There were no hepatic events adjudicated as “unassessable”. Of all hepatic events 
sent for adjudication, there were 4 cases that the adjudicators had insufficient data for severity only; 
nature of liver injury and causality were determined for all cases. In both ENGAGE AF and Hokusai 
VTE,  an  independent  adjudication  process  by  expert  hepatologists  was  established  to  provide  an 
unbiased  and  systematic  assessment  of  individual  cases  in  a  blinded  fashion.  There  were  82 
concurrent combination abnormalities (69 from ENGAGE AF: 22 on edoxaban 30 mg, 28 on edoxaban 
60 mg, 19 on warfarin; and 11 from Hokusai VTE: 7 on edoxaban 60 mg and 4 on warfarin). From 
independent adjudication using the CEC Charter definition (consistent with the FDA’s DILI Guidance) 
and  blinded  to  study  drug,  there  were  8  adjudicated  as  having  hepatocellular  injury  and 
probably/possibly related, of which 5 met Hy’s Rule criteria (1 edoxaban 30 mg, 3 edoxaban 60 mg, 
2  warfarin-treated).  There  were  3  additional  cases  (2  edoxaban  30  mg,  1  edoxaban  60  mg,  0 
warfarin) assessed as related per investigator (assessed as unlikely/unrelated per adjudication), all 
which  revealed  confounding  factors.  When  adding  these  3  additional  cases  to  those  already 
adjudicated by the independent hepatologists, it would result in 3 total Hy's law cases with edoxaban

30 mg, 3 total cases with edoxaban 60 mg and 2 total cases with warfarin. Therefore, the addition of 
these cases do not change the overall conclusion about hepatic safety of edoxaban, as the overall 
number  of  Hy's  law  cases  would  still  be  insufficient  for  a  meaningful  conclusion.  The  observed 
discrepancies between the investigator-reported and hepatologist-adjudicated Hy's law cases can be 
judged as within normal variability expected in these kind of assessments, where hepatologists tend 
to be more strict than investigators by applying pre-defined criteria for Hy's law cases. In addition, 
both pivotal studies were declared GCP compliant. Therefore, the validity of the adjudication process 
by the hepatologists was endorsed. There was a numerical excess of adjudicated hepatic events in the 
edoxaban  arm  compared  with  warfarin  (15  versus  6)  when  coadministered  with  macrolides,  with 
associated event rates of 1.31%/year and 0.53%/year. However, the number of subjects receiving 
macrolides  was  low  (edoxaban  60  mg  459  subjects  versus  warfarin  451  subjects).  Although  the 
hazard ratio for those taking macrolides was in favour of warfarin, the 95% CI was very wide and 
included unity, while the p-value for interaction was not significant. The Applicant considered that the 
imbalance between the two groups (edoxaban 60 mg and warfarin) may be a chance finding, to which 
the  CHMP  agreed.  The  Applicant  has  not  performed  specific  studies  on  the  effect  of  edoxaban  on 
mitochondrial extracts. The rationale for this was the lack of evidence from the nonclinical studies, 
specifically the long-term toxicology studies in which there were no apparent hepatotoxicity-related 
responses associated with this test compound. The Applicant shared the draft study protocol of the 
mitochondrial inhibition assay that was endorsed by the CHMP.  
The liver function tests (LFTs) evaluated in the various single and repeated dose toxicity studies were 
consistently  not  positive  for  toxicologically  significant  LFT  elevations  and  histopathology 
examinations. In addition, female rats at the doses that showed even higher edoxaban exposure did 
not present liver lesions. Regarding the observed secondary liver degeneration/necrosis in a cohort of 
dead  or  moribund/sacrificed  male  rats  in  the  high  dose  group  in  the  carcinogenicity  study,  the 
Applicant believed that it is associated with well-studied phenomena that hepatocytes are particularly 
vulnerable  to  necrotizing  insults  such  as  severe  metabolic  disturbances  including  hypoxia. 
Hepatocellular lesion in the high-dose male group is considered related to the moribund condition of 
animals  given  600/400 mg/kg/day  which  clearly  exceeded  the  MTD.  Therefore,  the  Applicant 
concluded that hepatocellular finding observed in the rat carcinogenicity study is of no toxicological 
significance and was not considered relevant to human, which was agreed by the CHMP. 
There  were  no  concurrent  combination  abnormality  cases  for  which  a  biopsy  was  performed  in 
ENGAGE AF. In Hokusai VTE, two subjects with combination abnormalities had a liver biopsy, one 
edoxaban-treated and one warfarin-treated subject. The edoxaban patient had a history of chronic 
cholecystitis that, on Day 47 of study had adenocarcinoma in the liver tissue. This case was classified 
as  severe  cholestasis,  unlikely/unrelated  to  study  drug  per  CEC  hepatologists  adjudication.  The 
additional case occurred during warfarin treatment. After six months of treatment with warfarin, the 
patient  developed  liver  enzyme  elevations  that  progressed  to  fulminant  hepatitis  requiring  liver 
transplant  (post-operative  fatality)  while  off  study  drug.  This  event  was  adjudicated  as  severe 
hepatocellular liver injury, probably/possibly related to study drug and meeting Hy’s Rule based on 
the CEC hepatologists adjudication. Therefore, the very scarce data on liver biopsies were insufficient 
to draw any meaningful conclusion, but did not raise any major concern on edoxaban. 
SmPC changes related to liver safety: It was agreed to add to the SmPC a recommendation of use 
with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and use with caution in patients 
with elevated liver enzymes ALT/AST > 2xULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5xULN and a recommendation to 
perform liver function testing prior to initiation of treatment. The Applicant also agreed to add that 
periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended for patients on edoxaban treatment beyond 
1 year.

Malignancies and bone fractures: Overall the reporting frequency of events of neoplasms was low 
and no significant imbalance was observed between groups in both pivotal studies. The percentage of 
subjects with new bone fractures was comparable among treatment groups in both pivotal studies. 
The most common bone fracture was hip/pelvis/proximal.  
MACE: In ENGAGE, MACE rates and its components (stroke, MI, fatal bleeding and CV death) were 
consistently lower with edoxaban 60 mg than with warfarin. In HOKUSAI-VTE, MI was numerically 
more frequent with edoxaban (60 mg/d standard dose) compared to warfarin. Furthermore, overall 
MACE was numerically increased with edoxaban as were the rare individual events CV death, fatal 
ischaemic stroke and SEE. Additional analyses showed that the difference in MI between edoxaban 
and warfarin was numerically larger in the CAD subpopulation (2.9% vs. 0.9%) than in the total study 
population (0.5% vs. 0.3%), but due to the low number of events (6 vs. 2) firm conclusions are not 
possible. In the AF study no such imbalance disfavouring edoxaban was observed (edoxaban 60 mg 
72 MI vs. warfarin 85 MI in the CAD subpopulation). Mechanistic data supporting or rebutting the 
assumption that edoxaban might favour development of MI in CAD patients compared to warfarin are 
not available. In summary, the CHMP agreed that there was no need to exclude CAD patients from 
treatment with edoxaban. 
Other  adverse  events  of  interest:  For  some  SMQs,  including  acute  renal  failure  (both  pivotal 
studies),  acute  polyneuropathies  (ENGAGE-AF),  anaphylactic  reactions  (HOKUSAI-VTE)  and 
interstitial lung disease (ILD) (HOKUSAI-VTE), a small increase is seen for edoxaban in comparison 
with warfarin: 
a) Acute renal failure: the imbalance is noticed in both edoxaban clinical trials with the edoxaban 
60 mg OD dose. There is no evidence that edoxaban may be associated to a worsening of acute renal 
failure  or  nephrotoxic  effect.  However,  there  is  evidence  that  patients  with  severe  bleeding  with 
edoxaban may experience worsening CrCL or even acute renal failure in the overall data from clinical 
trials and post-marketing experience. This finding has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC;  
b)  Acute  polyneuropathies:  An  imbalance  has  been  reported  on  the  incidence  of  acute 
polyneuropathies  with  edoxaban  in  the  ENGAGE-AF  study.  There  was  a  low  incidence  of  GBS/ALS 
throughout the edoxaban program with only 1 (serious) ALS case and no GBS case during edoxaban 
treatment/treatment  +  30  days.  The  small  imbalance  in  the  Acute  Polyneuropathy  Clinical  Event 
group  in  ENGAGE  AF  was  primarily  driven  by  the  PT  ‘polyneuropathy’,  which  is  not  specific  for 
ALS/GBS as the majority of the reported cases had confounding etiological factors and were unrelated 
to study medication and the differences are thus not suggestive of neurologic toxicity. No cases for 
GBS/ALS were found from post marketing data up to 30 June 2014;  
c)  Allergic  reactions: in HOKUSAI-VTE the numbers of anaphylactic reactions on-treament were 
higher with edoxaban than with warfarin (230 vs 197) as well as the cases of angioedema (48 vs. 38). 
There are some allergic reactions (hypersensitivity, allergic oedema and anaphylaxis) during pivotal 
trials  with  at  least  possible/probable  relationship  with  edoxaban  (Anaphylactic  reactions: 
Hokusai-VTE-61423070, 
Hokusai-VTE-35004296, 
ENGAGE-AF-12060006; 
Angioedema: 
Hokusai-VTE-10680073,  Hokusai-VTE-401115473,  ENGAGE-AF-42100001;  Severe  cutaneous 
reaction:  ENGAGE-AF-10070071)  and  a  post-marketing  case  of  eyelid  oedema/angioedema 
(DSJ-2013-20575).  These  cases  are  within  reported  with  other  direct  oral  factor  Xa  inhibitors 
(Xarelto,  Eliquis)  and  have  been  included  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  in  alignment  with  these 
compounds.  In  addition,  "pruritus"  (common)  and  "urticaria"  (uncommon)  were  reported  with 
edoxaban in pivotal trials and have been added to "rash" in the subsection of "Skin and Subcutaneous 
Tissue Disorders" with the said frequencies. 
d) Gastrointestinal symptoms: Nausea (common) has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC, 
as it was reported as related to edoxaban by the investigators in both pivotal studies. The findings in 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 116/138 
  
  
 
both pivotal studies for the remaining GI adverse events (gastritis, dyspepsia, diarrhoea) are not as 
consistent as for nausea and it is agreed not to include them in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths: The overall death rate was lowest for edoxaban 60 mg (8.0%) and highest for edoxaban 30 
mg (10.4%), with the rate for warfarin being 8.6% (pool analysis of Phase 3 Trials). The majority of 
deaths were classed as cardiovascular; the rate of cardiovascular deaths was lowest for edoxaban 60 
mg  (4.6%)  and  highest  for  edoxaban  30  mg  (6.8%),  with  the  rate  for  warfarin  being  5.1%.  The 
edoxaban 30 mg group included only subjects from ENGAGE AF. The death rate in edoxaban 30 mg 
was largely driven by ischemic events (suggesting a lack of effective anticoagulation). However, there 
was heterogeneity in the causes of death in both pivotal studies.  
Table  S-22:  Adjudicated  Deaths  in  Pooled  ENGAGE  AF  and  Hokusai  VTE  Studies:  Safety 
Analysis Set; Overall Study Period 
In ENGAGE-AF, a positive trend was found in favour of edoxaban 60 mg for all-cause death and CV 
death on-treatment and overall study period, mainly at expenses of lower CV death rates (7.5% vs. 
8.7%).  
Table S-23: Adjudicated Deaths – mITT/Safety Analysis Set, Modified On- Treatment and 
Overall (ENGAGE AF) 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 117/138 
  
  
 
 
On the contrary, in HOKUSAI-VTE, numerically more deaths were reported with edoxaban than with 
warfarin on-treatment + 30 days (79 vs 71) and during overall study period (136 vs. 130), including 
an imbalance in CV deaths on-treatment + 30 days (12 vs 6) and death due to infectious disease in 
the overall study period (25 vs 12). Among the latter, lung infections constituted a large proportion. 
These pneumonias were not related to PE but were due to the reduced general condition of the study 
patients with high co-morbidity. The most likely explanation for the observed difference is therefore a 
chance finding. For the numerically increased CV events in the VTE study, a causal relationship is 
difficult to delineate from the individual events but some uncertainty remains. It is reassuring that 
there is no hint for a higher rate with edoxaban of recurrent PEs or deaths in patients with a more 
severe  index  event,  i.e.  in  patients  with  potentially  higher  risk  for  a  (severe)  recurrent  VTE.  The 
all-cause mortality in the safety data set is listed in the SmPC, which is endorsed. Although the patient 
population is different, it is reassuring that mortality was numerically decreased with edoxaban in the 
ENGAGE AF trial.

days and Overall Study Period (Hokusai VTE) 
Assessment report

Page 118/138 
  
  
 
 
Finally,  ancillary  analyses  of  deaths  in  both  pivotal  studies  show  that  all-cause  mortality  and  CV 
mortality  are  not  reduced  by  edoxaban  60  mg  as  compared  with  warfarin,  particularly  in  centres 
above the median TTR and in original regions with a good quality of warfarin anticoagulation, like in 
Western Europe. In the overall European population (EEA + Switzerland), the point estimates slightly 
favour edoxaban in ENGAGE-AF and warfarin in Hokusai VTE, but the CIs for the HRs are wide and no 
significant differences in all-cause mortality or CV mortality are expected between edoxaban 60 mg 
and warfarin in AF or treatment of VTE in Europe. 
Other serious adverse events: The serious adverse events reported in edoxaban 60 mg and warfarin 
groups were generally well balanced. Cardiac disorders SOC including atrial fibrillation and cardiac 
failure were less frequent TESAEs on edoxaban 60 mg than warfarin. The edoxaban 30 mg group had 
a higher frequency of events of the  Cardiac system, particularly of atrial fibrillation, as previously 
noted for all TEAEs, and cardiac failure. TESAEs of anaemia and iron-deficiency anaemia were more 
frequent with edoxaban 60 mg (and edoxaban 30 mg) than warfarin treatment. TESAEs of gastritis 
were also more frequent with edoxaban 60 mg than warfarin treatment (24 vs 11). 
Laboratory findings 
There was a clear increase with edoxaban versus warfarin in the number of patients with Hb drop from 
baseline >2 g/dl in the ENGAGE-AF study (edoxaban 20.6% vs. warfarin 16.4%) (Table 3.2 of the 
Summary of Clinical Safety). The imbalance is also apparent, although of a lesser magnitude, in the 
HOKUSAI  VTE  study  (6.2%  vs  4.2%).  From  both  studies,  approximately  half  of  the  imbalance  in 
subjects with hemoglobin drop > 2 g/dL is accounted for by increased mucosal bleeds in edoxaban 
subjects compared with warfarin, which is consistent with the pathophysiology of mucosal bleeding 
that is associated with higher volume loss over time (compared with ICH). From ENGAGE AF, bleed 
events with very high volume loss (transfusion ≥ 4 units, ≥ 5 g/dL adjusted hemoglobin loss) were 
lower (total number of subjects and percentage) in edoxaban 60-mg than warfarin subjects. 
No imbalances in creatinine, platelet count or leucocyte count are evident in the pooled phase III 
studies. Hepatic events have been assessed in previous sections.

Safety in special populations 
Non-bleeding  adverse  events  in  special  populations:  Post-hoc  analyses  of  non-bleeding 
adverse events in subpopulations (by gender, age, race, renal or hepatic impairment, pregnancy and 
lactation) of pooled phase III trials, with some methodological limitations (e.g.: exclusion of some 
subpopulations in pivotal trials, low numbers and post-hoc nature of the analysis) did not reveal any 
safety concern in a particular population.

Events of special interest in the elderly: The following tables show non-bleedings AEs of interest 
in  the  elderly,  by  age  range,  separately  for  each  pivotal  study.  Data  pooling  was  not  deemed 
appropriate  due  to  differences  in  study  designs,  patients'  characteristics  and  different  treatment 
durations.  Bleeding  events  by  age  subgroups  were  already  included  in  subgroup  analyses  shown 
previously in the corresponding safety section and therefore are not presented here. As anticipated, 
regarless of treatment group, there was a higher rate of events in the older age groups compared with 
the younger age groups, but edoxaban compared favourably to warfarin for most types of adverse 
events  and  age  groups.  The  exception  is  the  numerical  increase  in  SAEs  in  Hokusai  VTE  study  in 
patients 85 years, which is due to increased number of infections (see also assessment of Q143). 
However, this increase was not seen in ENGAGE-AF and is hampered by the low number of subjects 
(n= 74) and events (27). Therefore, it is likely to be a chance finding.

Renally impaired patients: 
The  Applicant  provided  the  safety  evaluation  in  renally  impaired  patients  (moderate-severe  renal 
impariment: baseline CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min) separately for the two large phase 3 studies. No relevant 
imbalances (edoxaban vs, warfarin) were observed. Hence, the data provide no hint that safety and 
tolerability of edoxaban in renally impaired patients is worse than in the general study population. 
Pneumonia was more frequent with edoxaban in the VTE study (2.6% vs. 0.7%). This was also true 
for the general study population as discussed under "Serious Events and Deaths" subsection. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Concomitant medications and bleeding risk:  Subgroup analysis of major bleedings in ENGAGE 
AF  indicated  that  subjects  receiving  concomitant  aspirin  (use  was  permitted  with  a  dose  <100 
mg/day), other antiplatelet agents, and thienopyridines had an approximately 2-fold higher annual 
event  rate  for  major  bleeding  than  those  not  receiving  such  medications.  Additional  SmPC 
amendments have been implemented in this regard. In most subgroups, the HR for major bleeds for 
the comparison of the edoxaban 60 mg and edoxaban 30 mg groups with the warfarin group was less 
than 1. Some small increases above 1 were seen in patients receiving concomitant amiodarone and 
those  not  receiving  concomitant  ACEI/ARB.  However,  these  variations  are  within  expected  when 
many subgroups are analysed. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Permanent  discontinuations:  In  the  ENGAGE-AF,  the  percentage  of  subjects  who  permanently 
discontinued study drug was comparable among the edoxaban 30 mg, edoxaban 60 mg, and warfarin 
treatment  groups  (33.0%,  34.4%,  and  34.5%,  respectively).  The  most  common  reason  for 
permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  in  the  edoxaban  30  mg,  edoxaban  60  mg,  and  warfarin 
treatment groups was AE or suspected endpoint event (15.6%, 17.2% and 16.7%, respectively). In 
HOKUSAI-VTE,  the  percentage  of  subjects  who  permanently  discontinued  study  drug  was  also 
comparable between the edoxaban and warfarin treatment groups (16.9% and 17.4%, respectively). 
The most common reason for permanent discontinuation of study drug in the edoxaban and warfarin 
treatment  groups  was  non-target  endpoint  AE  (5.7%  and  5.4%,  respectively).  Suspected  target 
endpoints (specified efficacy or safety endpoints) accounted for 3.4% and 3.8%, respectively. 
Discontinuations  due  to  bleeding  adverse  events:  In  ENGAGE-AF,  bleeding  leading  to  study 
drug interruption was 13.2% in the edoxaban 60 mg group vs. 15.3% in the warfarin group. Bleeds 
that led to study drug permanent discontinuation were 3.9% in the edoxaban 60 mg group vs. 4.1% 
in the warfarin group. In HOKUSAI-VTE, bleeding leading to study drug interruption was 2.9% in the 
edoxaban  group  vs.  5.2%  in  the  warfarin  group.  Bleeds  that  led  to  study  drug  permanent 
discontinuation were 1.4% in both groups. 
Discontinuations  due  to  non-bleeding  AEs:  There  were  no  marked  differences  between  the 
treatment groups with regard to the TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation in pooled 
phase 3 studies (edoxaban 60 mg 8.6% vs warfarin 8.3%). In summary, in phase 3 trials there were 
no  marked  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  with  regard  to  overall  permanent 
discontinuations, or those related to bleeding or non-bleeding AEs. 
Post marketing experience 
Edoxaban  was  approved  in  Japan  on  22  Apr  2011  for  the  prevention  of  VTE  following  total  knee 
arthroplasty (TKA), total hip arthroplasty (THA), and hip fracture surgery (HFS). For the purpose of 
this  MAA,  a  cumulative  output  from  the  global  safety  database  was  generated  from  launch  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015 
Page 122/138 
  
  
 
 
 
edoxaban in Japan through to 30 Sep 2013. To obtain the estimated of number of patients exposed to 
edoxaban,  the  distribution  data  between  the  launch  and  September  2013  were  used. Assuming  a 
dosing  period  per  patient  of  14  days  regardless  of  strength,  the  number  of  patients  exposed  to 
LIXIANA  was  estimated  and  the  number  of  total  and  the  most  frequent  AEs  was  assessed  during 
post-marketing  experience.  These  events  are  within  expected  in  patients  undergoing  major 
orthopaedic surgery. No specific clinical data have been generated on the use of activated charcoal to 
reduce absorption in case of edoxaban overdose.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database was mainly derived from two Phase 3 studies (ENGAGE-AF in NVAF and Hokusai 
VTE  in  patients  with  acute  VTE),  which  amounts  to  18,010  patients  treated  with  edoxaban  for 
approximately 1.9 years. In these studies, edoxaban showed a generally lower rate of adverse events 
than  warfarin,  mainly  driven  by  a  lower  risk  of  major  and  CRNMB  than  warfarin.  The  benefit  in 
bleedings  was  consistent  across  most  subgroups  analysed,  including  fragile  patients,  but  was  not 
significant in centers where warfarin was managed optimally. Depending on localisation, edoxaban 
showed a consistent lower risk of ICH than warfarin but an augmented risk of mucosal bleeding (e.g.: 
gastrointestinal bleedings and vaginal bleedings), which was associated to a significant number of 
patients experiencing a drop in Hb > 2 g/dl as compared to baseline.  
Major and CRNMB was the more frequent AE with edoxaban (11.1 events per 100 patient-year in 
NVAF  and  8.5%  in  acute  VTE;  corresponding  MB  rates  were  2.75  %  patient-year  and  1.3%, 
respectively).  Anaemia  was  reported  for  a  higher  proportion  of  edoxaban  subjects  (4.2%)  than 
warfarin subjects (2.9%).  
Intracranial hemorrhages: Ancillary analyses provided by the Applicant showed that the benefits 
of edoxaban versus warfarin in ICH were consistent in the worst case (high TTR and European, mainly 
Western  Europe,  population).  This  benefit  was  consistent  with  those  observed  with  other  similar 
compounds.  The  class  benefit  seems  to  be  driven  by  an  intrinsically  risk  of  ICH  with  vitamin  K 
antagonists, which is seen even at high TTR. The absolute benefit of edoxaban versus warfarin was 
difficult to be established due to low numbers of events, but could be estimated to be around 3 ICH 
avoided  per  1,000  patients  treated  per  year  in  the  European  AF  population  (edoxaban  3  ICH  vs 
warfarin  6  ICH/1,000/yr).  In  the  overall  ENGAGE  AF  study  population,  the  projected  benefit  was 
around 5 ICH per 1,000 patients treated (edoxaban 4 ICH vs. warfarin 9 ICH/1,000/yr). In the overall 
Hokusai  VTE  study  population,  the  absolute  benefit  of  edoxaban  versus  warfarin  in  ICH  may  be 
similar, around 3 ICH avoided per 1,000 patients treated for acute VTE (edoxaban 1 ICH/1,000 vs. 
warfarin 4 ICH/1,000), but difficult to establish due to low number of events and shorter durations of 
treatment (usually lasting less than 1 year).  
Major bleeding: Patients who experienced major bleedings had older age, higher proportion of renal 
impairment and concomitant ASA use than patients without major bleedings. These patients were 
more  represented  in  ENGAGE  AF  than  in  Hokusai  VTE.  In  both  ENGAGE  AF  and  Hokusai  VTE, 
demographic  characteristics  in  subjects  with  adjudicated  major  bleeds  were generally  comparable 
between treatment groups, except for concomitant aspirin use in Hokusai VTE which was higher in the 
edoxaban than the warfarin group. In ENGAGE AF the rate of patients needing hospitalization was less 
frequent in edoxaban than in warfarin in ENGAGE AF (1.54%/yr vs 1.81%/yr), transfusion ≥ 2 units 
was  similar  (1.05%/yr  in  both  groups),  as  well  as  need  for  surgery  (0.20%/yr  vs  0.29%/yr). 
Hospitalization with intensive care was lower with edoxaban (0.7%/yr vs 1.4%/yr). In Hokusai VTE,

need  for  surgery  (<0.1  vs  <  0.1%  and  hospitalization  with  inensive  care  unit  (0.3  vs  0.4%)  was 
generally comparable between edoxaban and  warfarin treatment groups. There was lower 30-day

all-cause mortality after major bleeding in the edoxaban 60-mg than the warfarin group (ENGAGE AF: 
0.5% vs. 1.0%; Hokusai VTE: 0.1% vs. 0.3%). Major bleed outcome of resolved with sequelae was 
lower with edoxaban than with warfarin in ENGAGE AF (0.7% vs 1.2%), but not in Hokusai VTE (0.2% 
vs. 0.1%). 
Gastrointestinal  bleedings:  In  ENGAGE  AF,  edoxaban  60-mg  subjects  had  a  higher  rate  of 
Major/CRNM  GI  bleed  than  warfarin  subjects  (3.54%/yr  vs.  2.42%/yr),  including  those  requiring 
hospitalization  (1.61%/yr  vs.  1.27%/yr)  and  transfusion  (0.97%/yr  vs.  0.84%/yr).  However,  the 
more  severe  bleedings,  resulting  in  death  of  hospitalisation  in  intensive care  unit,  are  more often 
reported with warfarin than with edoxaban. The increase in GI bleedings (HR≈ 1.46) mimic those 
reported  with  dabigatran  150  mg  BID  in  RE-LY  study  (HR:  1.52)  and  rivaroxaban  20  mg  OD  in 
ROCKET AF (HR ≈ 1.26) for CRNM GI bleed. Further SmPC changes in sections 4.4 and 4.8 have been 
implemented to warn about this increase in risk. 
Other  adverse  events:  Gastrointestinal TEAEs (diarrhoea, nausea, gastritis and dyspepsia) were 
also reported for a higher proportion of edoxaban subjects than warfarin subjects (6.3% vs 6% for 
diarrhoea; 3.4% vs. 2.8% for nausea; 2.1% vs. 1.9% for gastritis and 1.8% vs. 1.6% for dyspepsia, 
respectively). The most notable difference was for INR increase which was, as anticipated, much more 
common on warfarin than edoxaban treatment (4.7% compared with 0.5%). The rates of deaths and 
serious adverse events were similar with edoxaban and warfarin, as where the rates of patients that 
discontinued study drug. However, some imbalances were found in hepatic events, cases of acute 
renal failure, acute polyneuropathies and allergic reactions.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Edoxaban was generally associated to a lower risk of adverse events than warfarin, mainly driven by 
a lower risk of major and CRNMB in pivotal studies. The benefit was consistent across most subgroups 
analysed, including fragile patients, but was not significant in centers where warfarin was managed 
optimally.  Edoxaban  showed  a  lower  risk  of  ICH  than  warfarin  but  an  augmented  risk  of  mucosal 
bleeding (e.g.: gastrointestinal bleedings and vaginal bleedings). Gastrointestinal TEAEs (diarrhoea, 
nausea, gastritis and dyspepsia) was also reported for a higher proportion of edoxaban subjects than 
warfarin subjects (6.3% vs 6% for diarrhoea; 3.4% vs. 2.8% for nausea; 2.1% vs. 1.9% for gastritis 
and 1.8%  vs. 1.6%  for dyspepsia, respectively). No significant imbalances were found in rates of 
death or SAEs.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The ENGAGE AF was a large (n=21,105 patients) double-blinded, event-driven, non-inferiority clinical 
trial  where  patients  with  NVAF  were  randomised  to  either  edoxaban  30mg  once  daily  treatment 
group, or edoxaban 60mg once daily treatment group or warfarin.  
The  study  provided  evidence  of  non-inferiority  for  edoxaban  60  mg  OD  versus  warfarin  for  the 
composite of all strokes and SEE (HR: 0.79; 97.5% CI: 0.632, 0.985; non-inferiority margin: 1.38; 
p<0.0001 for non-inferiority; mITT, on treatment) and for the composite of ischemic strokes and SEE 
(HR:  0.92;  95%CI:  0.73-1.15;  PP,  on-treatment)  (endpoint  recommended  in  the  current  EMA 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for prevention of stroke and systemic embolic 
events in patients with NVAF [EMA/CHMP/341363/2014])).  
The mean time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR: 2-3) was 64.9% (median 68.4%), the highest across 
the contemporary AF studies, and the rate of stroke/SEE event rate in the warfarin arm (1.5%/yr) was 
the lowest.  
Analyses of composite (first-event) endpoint of stroke, SEE, and CV mortality, the endpoint of MACE, 
and the composite endpoint of stroke, SEE, and all-cause mortality were consistent with the analysis 
of  the  primary  endpoint. The  trend  for  superiority of  the  high  edoxaban  dose  (60  mg  OD)  versus 
warfarin for the primary endpoint was supported by secondary analyses of patients with fatal strokes 
(80 vs. 86) disabling strokes (54 vs. 57), recurrent stroke/SEE events (5 vs. 8; mITT, on-treatment 
period) and analysis of the composite of stroke, SEE and TIA (HR: 0.88; 95%CI: 0.746 to 1.042; mITT 
on-treatment period).  
Given  that  NVAF  population  and  AF  management  were  heterogeneous,  exploratory  analyses  of 
subgroups in ENGAGE-AF were conducted by INR/TTR level by centre and quartiles as well as by at 
least 14 patient/study characteristics. Subgroup analyses by patient/study characteristics showed a 
generally  consistent  effect  of  edoxaban  in  most  subgroups,  but  not  in  some  relevant  ones  (see: 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects). 
HOKUSAI VTE: Treatment of VTE including DVT and PE, and prevention of recurrent VTE 
HOKUSAI VTE was a large (n=8292) double-blinded, event-driven, non-inferiority comparative trial 
(edoxaban  60  mg  OD  vs  warfarin)  in  patients  with  acute  VTE.  Approximately  41%  of  patients 
presented with PE as index event. Intended treatment duration was 3 months in 6% of patients, 6 
months in 37% of patients and 12 months in 57% of patients. Edoxaban and warfarin regimes were 
preceded by heparin lead-in treatment for at least 5 days.  
The study showed evidence of non-inferiority with regard to the composite endpoint of documented 
symptomatic recurrent VTE (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.70-1.13; non-inferiority margin = 1.5; p<0.0001 
for non-inferiority; mITT, overall study period). For subjects presenting with PE (with or without DVT), 
50 (1.2%) edoxaban and 58 (1.4%) of warfarin subjects had a recurrent VTE [HR (95% CI): 0.85 
(0.64, 1.14)]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/321083/2015

The effect of edoxaban was generally consistent across subgroups tested in the HOKUSAI-VTE study. 
Overall, of the 55 comparisons presented from 18 subgroup analyses, most (45) resulted in a point 
estimate favouring edoxaban. Edoxaban effect was (significantly) better in fragile than in non-fragile 
patients. In general, the effects of edoxaban were also better (although no statistically significant 
interaction was found) in index PE, age >75 years and history of cancer, which is reassuring.  
Regarding the quality of oral anticoagulation, the mean TTR was 63.5%, which is higher than that 
reported in other contemporary studies with NOACs in this indication (from 57% in RE-COVER II to 
62.7%  in  EINSTEIN  PE).  The  edoxaban  group  had  a  relative  reduction  in  risk  for  recurrent  VTE 
compared to warfarin for subjects at centers TTR < 60% (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.574, 1.364) and also 
at centers with TTR ≥60% (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.653, 1.153).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The utility of the lowest edoxaban dose (15 mg) was restricted to the process of switching from 
Lixiana to VKA for patients currently on edoxaban 30 mg (reduced dose in patients with presumed 
increased exposure). It was unclear whether dose reduction from 30 mg OD to 15 mg was necessary 
in this process and if the 15 mg dose will provide a sufficient level of anticoagulation. The applicant 
modelled factor Xa activity over the 24-hour dosing period for the doses used in the ENGAGE AF study 
and showed that even the 15 mg dose has some antithrombotic effect, although lower than that of a 
full  therapeutic  dose,  as  expected.  However,  edoxaban  15  mg  is  not  to  be  administered  in 
monotherapy, but only concomitantly with warfarin during the switching procedure. The ENGAGE AF 
protocol included 15 mg strength as provision intended to mitigate the risk of bleeding expected for 
those patients who were taking two oral anticoagulants concomitantly.  
ENGAGE AF: Prevention of stroke and SEE in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
Although  the  low  edoxaban  dose  (30  mg  OD)  showed  non-inferiority  versus  warfarin  for  all 
strokes/SEE (HR: 1.07; 97.5% CI: 0.87-1.31; p=0.0055 for non-inferiority; mITT, on-treatment), it 
was inferior to warfarin for the composite of ischemic stroke/SEE 1.47 (HR: 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.80; PP, 
on-treatment).  The  trend  for  inferior  efficacy  of  edoxaban  30  mg  OD  versus  warfarin  was  also 
supported by the analysis of pure thromboembolic events (ischemic stroke/SEE as well as MI), by the 
higher number of disabling strokes (82 and 57 subjects in edoxaban 30 mg group and the warfarin 
group,  respectively),  by  the  number  of  patients  who  had  ≥  2  occurrences  of  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint (21 and 8 subjects in edoxaban 30 mg group and the warfarin group, respectively; mITT 
analysis set, on-treatment period) as well as by the high number of events when TIA was added to 
stroke and SEE (edoxaban 30 mg event rate 2.28% per year vs warfarin 1.92% per year; HR: 1.19; 
95%CI: 1.021 to 1.389; mITT on-treatment period).  
Exploratory analyses of subgroups in ENGAGE-AF were conducted by INR/TTR level by centre and 
quartiles as well as by at least 14 patient/study characteristics. However, stroke/SEE rates tended to 
favour warfarin in patients recruited in Western Europe and those with normal renal function. 
The interpretation of the results in Western Europe was hampered by the limitations of subgroup 
analyses and the low event rates. Whether these regional variations may be acceptable in the context 
of the heterogeneous countries of EEA region was discussed taking into account the fact that ENGAGE 
AF demonstrated non-inferiority of edoxaban 60 mg versus a well-controlled warfarin regime in the 
overall population. In addition, all-cause mortality and CV mortality were broadly similar in the overall 
vs. on-treatment analysis in both the edoxaban and warfarin groups in Western Europe. In summary, 
the overal study results were considered representative for the European population. 
In  NVAF,  although  the  overall  benefit  risk  in  the  AF  indication was  considered  positive  across  the 
continuum  of  renal  function  at  the  population  level,  there  were  indications  of  reduced  efficacy  of

edoxaban compared to well-managed warfarin therapy that could be of relevance at the individual 
level  in  patients  with  increased  creatinine  clearance.  In  general,  a  trend  towards  decreasing 
efficacy  with  increasing  creatinine  clearance  was  observed  for  edoxaban  compared  to 
well-managed  warfarin.  The  data  in  patients  with  normal  renal  function  were  considered  to  be 
sufficiently robust, making a chance adverse finding unlikely. They may be explained to a combination 
of a lower exposure to edoxaban 60 mg in patients with normal renal function (in comparison with the 
exposure  to  60  mg  in  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment)  and  a  well-managed  warfarin  therapy 
resulting in a low stroke/SEE rate in the control group, particularly in patients with high creatinine 
clearances. Therefore, a warning has been included regarding this trend in the SmPC.  
Subgroup  analyses  of  stroke/SEE  by  INR/TTR  level  suggest  that  the  effect  size  (reduction  of 
stroke/SEE by edoxaban) decreases as the quality of anticoagulation in the control group 
increases  (i.e.:  in  centers  with  TTR  >  60%  and  when  INR/TTR  was  above  the  fourth  quartile, 
>73.9%). When the TTR data were examined by quartiles for the edoxaban 60 mg group compared 
to warfarin, the HR for the primary endpoint in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartile was 0.80, 0.73, and 
0.74, respectively, and for the 4th quartile was 1.07 (95%CI: 0.65-1.75). For the edoxaban 30 mg 
group compared to warfarin, the HR for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles were 0.82, 1.02, 1.22, and 
1.30 (95%CI: 0.81-2.09), respectively. These data were expected in the light of similar results in 
previous studies with novel oral anticoagulants in NVAF and were presented in the SmPC.  
The analyses of efficacy in ENGAGE-AF by subgroups excluding haemorrhagic stroke were provided 
(i.e.: including only ischemic stroke and SEE). The event rate for composite of ischemic stroke and 
SEE was lower in the edoxaban 60-mg group than in the warfarin group for most subgroups, with the 
HR less than 1.0 for the overall study period, but in some of the sub-groups the HR was more than 1.0. 
However, there were several significant (p<0.05) interactions:  
-for  the  type  of  atrial  fibrillation:  The  HR  was  0.79  and  0.85  for  subjects  with  persistent  and 
permanent  AFs  and  1.73  for  subjects  with  paroxysmal  AF.  However,  this  finding  was  based  on  a 
relatively low number of events and patients in this subgroup. The variations in stroke/SEE rates in 
the warfarin group was the main responsible for the interaction. 
 - for the VKA-naïve versus VKA experienced subjects: The HR was 0.75 for VKA naïve subjects 
and 1.17 for VKA experienced subjects. VKA-experienced patients comprised the majority of patients 
enrolled in ENGAGE-AF (59%). The finding indicated that switching from warfarin to edoxaban was 
not associated with a benefit in efficacy. Considering the primary endpoint of stroke/SEE, a significant 
interaction  was  found  for  the  overall  study  period  for  prior  VKA  use  (p=0.0253)  but  this  was  not 
observed for the on-treatment period (p=0.3545). The most important patient characteristics of the 
VKA experienced subjects in the ENGAGE AF study was the high TTR at 70%. Nonetheless, for the 
primary endpoint of stroke/SEE, edoxaban 60 mg did show similar efficacy  and even for ischemic 
stroke, any gap in efficacy was less than 0.5%/year and was offset by a clinically significant decrease 
in major bleeds, resulting in similar net clinical outcome and all-cause mortality.  
- for the verapamil  subgroup: The HR was 0.92 for subjects without concomitant verapamil and 
2.59  for  subjects  who  took  concomitant  verapamil.  Verapamil  use  was  very  low  (<5%  of  total 
population) and number of events were low (18 vs. 7). Nevertheless, it suggests that the edoxaban 30 
mg dose used in these patients was insufficient and 60mg dose was recommended for these patients.  
No data were available on subjects during the first 3 months after implantation of a bioprosthetic 
heart valves, and therefore a non-recommendation of use was included in the product information.  
The extrapolation of the data to patients with CHADS2 index score=1 (included in the indication) 
was accepted.

HOKUSAI VTE: Treatment of VTE including DVT and PE, and prevention of recurrent VTE 
Although recurrent VTE (DVT or PE) (main efficacy endpoint) favoured numerically edoxaban over 
warfarin in the overall study period, there was a numerical imbalance in the number of all-cause 
deaths in the overall study period of the HOKUSAI-VTE study (edoxaban 122 vs warfarin 106), thus 
leading to a hazard ratio of 1.00 in the superiority analysis of recurrent VTE and all-cause death for the 
overall study period (HR: 1.00; 95%CI: 0.83-1.20; p=0.9933). Analysing the time-course of deaths, 
the imbalance was not attributed to the on-treatment deaths (edoxaban 35 vs warfarin 33) but to an 
excess in deaths due to infectious diseases in the edoxaban arm after treatment had been stopped. 
This imbalance was not seen in the ENGAGE-AF study in a population with AF.  
No specific VTE extension studies have been conducted with edoxaban. However, the design and 
analysis (mITT Overall versus On-Treatment) of the study allowed assessing extension of therapy/the 
secondary  prevention  of  VTE  without  the  need  for  a  formal  extension  study.  The  main  issue  in 
HOKUSAI-VTE regarding duration of therapy was that many patients may have benefited from longer 
anticoagulative treatment durations. Therefore, it was agreed not to limit the duration of treatment of 
VTE to the 1 year study duration of HOKUSAI-VTE.  
During  pivotal  studies,  dose  reductions  were  made  in  patients  concomitantly  receiving  P-gp 
inhibitors. However, the totality of the data does not support diminishing the dose when edoxaban 
60 mg is concomitantly administered with verapamil, quinidine or amiodarone, and this was reflected 
in the SmPC.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety database is mainly derived from two Phase 3 studies (ENGAGE-AF in NVAF and Hokusai 
VTE in patients with acute VTE), which amounts to 18,010 patients treated with edoxaban for a mean 
of approximately 1.9 years. Major and clinically-relevant nonmajor (CRNM) bleeding was the most 
frequent  AE  with  edoxaban  (11.1  events  per  100  patient-year  in  NVAF  and  8.5%  in  acute  VTE; 
corresponding  major  bleeding  (MB)  rates  were  2.75  %  patient-year  and  1.3%,  respectively). 
Anaemia was reported for a higher proportion of edoxaban subjects (4.2%) than warfarin subjects 
(2.9%) in the pooled Phase 3 studies. In these studies, edoxaban showed a generally lower risk of MB 
and  CRNMB  than  warfarin.  The  benefit  was  consistent  across  most  subgroups  analysed,  including 
fragile patients, but was not significant in centers where warfarin was managed optimally. Depending 
on localisation, edoxaban showed a consistently lower risk of ICH than warfarin but an augmented risk 
of mucosal bleeding (e.g.: gastrointestinal bleedings and vaginal bleedings), which was associated 
with a significant number of patients experiencing a drop in Hb < 2 g/dl as compared to baseline. 
Gastrointestinal TEAEs (diarrhoea, nausea, gastritis and dyspepsia) was also reported for a higher 
proportion of edoxaban subjects than warfarin subjects (6.3% vs 6% for diarrhoea; 3.4% vs. 2.8% 
for nausea; 2.1% vs. 1.9% for gastritis and 1.8% vs. 1.6% for dyspepsia, respectively). The most 
notable difference was for INR increased which was, as anticipated, much more common on warfarin 
than  edoxaban  treatment  (4.7%  compared  with  0.5%).  The  rates  of  deaths  and  serious  adverse 
events were similar with edoxaban and warfarin, as  where the rates of patients that discontinued 
study drug. However, some imbalances were found in hepatic events, cases of acute renal failure, 
acute polyneuropathies and allergic reactions, and MACE (Hokusai VTE study only) (see Uncertainty in 
the knowledge about the unfavourable effects).

It  seems  that  an  important  benefit  of  edoxaban,  as  with  other  NOACs,  was  the  reduction  in  ICH. 
However, the projected benefit in ICH may be highly dependent on the expected rate of ICH with 
warfarin in standard practise. For example, the rates of ICH with warfarin in patients with NVAF in 
standard practice in North-America and Europe are low (approximately 0.4 per 100 patients-year in 
both),  which  is  much  lower  than  the  0.85  per  100  patient-year  incidence  found  with  warfarin  in 
ENGAGE-AF.  In  addition,  in  ENGAGE-AF,  there  was  no  difference  between  edoxaban  60  mg  and 
warfarin  with  regard  to  overall  major  bleedings  when  warfarin  treatment  was  optimally  managed 
(i.e.: in centers with TTR > 66.4%), which is the rule in many European centers. Similar results were 
found  in  Hokusai-VTE  with  respect  to  the  lack  of  reduction  in  bleeding  events  when  warfarin  was 
optimally managed. The consequences of major bleedings seemed more benign with edoxaban than 
with warfarin as shown by a lower 30-day all-cause mortality after major bleeding in the edoxaban 
60-mg  than  the  warfarin  group  in  both  trials,  and by  a  lower  rate of  hospitalization  due  to  major 
bleeding in AF patients. Ongoing development plans for assay to measure the anticoagulant activity 
and potential specific reversal agents have been included in the agreed RMP. 
Hepatic safety 
There were some imbalances against edoxaban 60 mg versus warfarin  in pooled phase 3 studies in: 
a) the cases of hyperbilirubinaemia (edoxaban 60 mg 0.3% vs warfarin 0.1%); b) and concurrent 
elevation of ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN & Total Bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN (edoxaban 60 mg 0.4% vs warfarin 
0.3%, corresponding to 43 and 29 cases, respectively; Pooled Phase 3 trials); c) the percentage of 
subjects in the edoxaban 60 mg group versus warfarin that were characterized by an independent 
hepatologist as having a hepatocellular injury (1.1% vs. 1.0%, respectively); d) In the percentage of 
cases of liver injury possibly/probably related to study drug [(edoxaban 60 mg 0.4% (48 of 11008 
subjects)  versus  warfarin  0.3%  (30  of  11010  subjects)];  e)  in  the  percentage  of  liver  injury 
adjudicated as severe (edoxaban 60 mg 0.4% vs warfarin 0.3%) ; f) and in the number of Hy’s law 
cases  adjudicated  as  severe  hepatocellular  liver  injury  possibly/probably  related  to  study  drug 
(edoxaban any dose 2 vs warfarin 1). It was agreed to add important safety information related to 
hepatic  safety  to  the  SmPC.  The  issue  will  be  further  investigated  in  the  non-interventional 
post-authorization safety study (PASS) in patients with AF.  
There were other non-bleeding events reported during phase 3 studies, including: acute renal failure, 
acute polyneuropathies, anaphylactic reactions, interstitial lung disease, and MACE in which a small 
numerical increase was seen for edoxaban in comparison with warfarin. It was agreed that some of 
these numerical imbalances like acute polyneuropathies and MACE, are likely due to chance. Acute 
renal failure could be associated with some severe bleedings, and allergic reactions were within what 
has been reported for other NOACs. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Strokes in association with AF are often fatal, and those patients who survive are left more disabled 
by  their  stroke  and  more  likely  to  suffer  a  recurrence  than  patients  with  other  causes  of  stroke. 
Edoxaban 60 mg OD showed at least similar efficacy compared to warfarin in reducing stroke rates in 
NVAF. This was supported by secondary analyses of patients with fatal strokes, disabling strokes (54 
vs. 57) and recurrent stroke/SEE events. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep vein 
thrombosis  (DVT)  and  pulmonary  embolism  (PE),  is  the  third  leading  cause  of  mortality  due  to 
circulatory diseases, only behind myocardial infarction and stroke. Edoxaban 60 mg OD also showed 
similar efficacy compared to warfarin in preventing recurrent VTE. 
With respect to safety, an important benefit of edoxaban, as with other new anticoagulants, is the 
reduction in ICH. However, the projected benefit in ICH may be highly dependent on the expected

rate of ICH with warfarin in different conditions in standard practise. In addition, edoxaban showed an 
augmented risk of mucosal bleeding (e.g.: gastrointestinal bleedings and vaginal bleedings), which 
was associated with a significant number of patients experiencing a drop in Hb > 2 g/dl as compared 
to baseline. It was reassuring that the most severe bleedings were less frequent with edoxaban than 
with  warfarin.  The  information  about  increase  in  mucosal  bleedings  was  added  as  warning  in  the 
SmPC. Finally, no differences in overall number of deaths were found between warfarin and edoxaban 
in pivotal studies. 
All  these  data  suggest  that  edoxaban  is  non-inferior  to  warfarin  in  both  indications,  with  some 
advantages related to ICH but disadvantages related to mucosal bleedings.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit-risk balance of edoxaban was considered positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
In  NVAF,  although  the  overall  benefit-risk  balance  in  the  NVAF  indication  was  considered  positive 
across  the  continuum  of  renal  function  at  the  population  level,  there  were  indications  of  reduced 
efficacy of edoxaban compared to well-managed warfarin therapy that could be of relevance at the 
individual level in patients with increased creatinine clearance.  
In general, a trend towards decreasing efficacy with increasing creatinine clearance was observed for 
edoxaban compared to well-managed warfarin. A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC  to  create  awareness  about  this  observation.  The  applicant  agreed  to  further  evaluate 
post-marketing whether a higher QD dose would provide a further improvement of the benefit-risk 
relationship in patients with high creatinine clearance This was included in the agreed version of the 
RMP  as  MEA  to  address  potential  risk:  “trend  towards  decreasing  efficacy  in  patients  with  high 
creatinine clearance 
Monitoring  of  anti-Xa  activity  may  be  helpful  to  individualise  the  treatment  and  dose  in  certain 
circumstances  (e.g.:  at  the  beginning  of  treatment  in  patients  with  cumulative  risk  factors  for 
decreased  exposure,  in  case  of  high  renal  clearance  combined  with  high  body  weight;  in  case  of 
emergency or overdose). The Applicant has submitted a plan for developing a validated anti-Xa test 
to measure edoxaban's anticoagulant activity. The anti-Xa assay will be first validated retrospectively 
by  using  anti-Xa,  efficacy/safety  data  from  pivotal  trials,  and  then  prospectively  in  future  clinical 
trials.  
In the treatment of acute VTE, HOKUSAI VTE provided evidence of non-inferiority of edoxaban 60 mg 
versus  warfarin  (both  regimes  preceded  by  heparin  lead-in  treatment).  No  specific  VTE  extension 
studies have been conducted with edoxaban. However, the design and analysis (mITT Overall versus 
On-Treatment) of the study allowed assessing extension of therapy/the secondary prevention of VTE 
without  the  need  for  a  formal  “extension”  study.  It  was  also  agreed  not  to  limit  the  duration  of 
treatment  of  VTE  to  the  1  year  study  duration  of  HOKUSAI-VTE  but  to  leave  the  decision  to  the 
treating physician taking into account clinical practice guidelines, which recommend that the duration 
of therapy be individualised. 
In both pivotal studies, edoxaban showed a generally lower risk of MB and CRNMB than warfarin. The 
benefit  was  consistent  across  most  subgroups  analysed,  including  fragile  patients,  but  was  not 
significant  in  centers  where  warfarin  was  managed  optimally.  Again,  it  was  debated  whether  the 
safety  advantage  found  in  these  studies  can  be  extrapolated  to  many  European  centers  in  which 
warfarin treatment is optimal. Depending on localisation, edoxaban showed a lower risk of ICH than 
warfarin,  which  was  considered  a  major  benefit,  consistent  with  that  reported  for  other  NOACs. 
Edoxaban  showed  an  augmented  risk  of  mucosal  bleeding  (e.g.:  gastrointestinal  bleedings  and

vaginal bleedings), which was associated with a significant number of patients experiencing a drop in 
Hb < 2 g/dl as compared to baseline.  
There were  some imbalances in  hepatic events  not favouring edoxaban 60 mg versus warfarin. A 
definitive association between these novel oral factor Xa inhibitors and risk of hepatic injury has not 
been confirmed. The uncertainties have been solved with SmPC ammendments and an RMP plan to 
further investigate this potential risk postauthorisation.

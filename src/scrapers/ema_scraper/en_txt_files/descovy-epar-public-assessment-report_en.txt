2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
HIV 1 infection is a life threatening and serious disease of major public health significance, with 
approximately 35 million people infected worldwide. 
Standard of care for the treatment of HIV 1 infection uses combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) to 
suppress viral replication to below detectable limits, increase CD4 cell counts, and stop disease progression. 
For ART-naive HIV infected patients, current treatment guidelines suggest that initial therapy consist of two 
nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) and either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (NNRTI), a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI). 
Virologically suppressed, HIV infected patients may switch from their current regimen because of safety or 
tolerability concerns or for regimen simplification. All patient populations may benefit from once daily FDC 
regimens as these have been shown to provide increased adherence and improved clinical and virologic 
outcomes. 
The success of ART means that morbidity and mortality in the HIV infected population is increasingly driven 
by non AIDS–associated comorbidities. Clinical attention has become more focused on the optimization of 
tolerability, long term safety, and adherence to potent ART regimens. There remains a significant medical 
need for new, effective therapies that take into consideration the non-HIV comorbidities, demographics of the 
aging HIV infected population, antiretroviral (ARV) resistance and regimen simplification. 
Chronic kidney disease is important, since observational studies have demonstrated a relationship between 
kidney disease and progression to AIDS and death. Moreover, HIV associated nephropathy present in up to 
30% of patients and this is a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. 
ART with proven efficacy and safety in the both elderly and young patients is important; limited data and 
treatment options are available in both populations. The elderly have increased risks for comorbidities, 
including those related to renal and bone. There are specific and complex challenges for the treatment of 
adolescents, who also represent the population that will require ART for the longest time. 
Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide analogue with limited oral bioavailability that inhibits HIV-1 reverse 
transcription. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), an oral prodrug of TFV, has improved bioavailability, and 
delivers high systemic exposures of TFV with favourable efficacy and safety data. TDF is a preferred NtRTI for 
use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
While TDF is used broadly in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, an important identified risk with its use is 
nephrotoxicity, which is associated with increased creatinine in some patients, increased protein loss 
(particularly tubular), and occasional cases of proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT) (including Fanconi 
syndrome). These risks necessitate increased renal monitoring with use of TDF-containing products, placing 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 10/162 
  
  
 
burden on the patient and healthcare provider. Reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) have also been 
seen after the initiation of ART, with larger decreases in BMD observed with TDF than with other NRTIs. 
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational oral prodrug of TFV. TAF is more stable in plasma than TDF, 
provides higher intracellular levels of the active phosphorylated metabolite tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), 
and approximately 90% lower circulating levels of TFV relative to TDF. The distinct metabolism of TAF offers 
the potential for an improved safety profile compared with TDF. 
The Applicant has co-formulated TAF (as 11 mg or 28 mg of the fumarate) in FDC tablets of two strengths, 
each with 200 mg emtricitabine (FTC; Emtriva), which is a NRTI approved for treatment of HIV-1 infection in 
adults and children (generally 3 months of age or older). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 200 mg of emtricitabine (FTC) and either 
10 or 25 mg of tenofovir alafenamide (as fumarate - TAF) as active substances.  
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate 
Film-coating: polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol 3350, talc and iron oxide black (E172) 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with polypropylene (PP) continuous-
threads, child-resistant caps and lined with an induction activated aluminium foil liners. Each bottle contains 
silica gel desiccant and a polyester coil as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Emtricitabine (FTC) 
The information on chemistry, manufacturing and control of emtricitabine (FTC) active substance has been 
previously assessed through centralised procedure and approved in the EU as part of the marketing 
authorisation applications for Emtriva, Truvada, Atripla, Eviplera and Stribild. 
The Module 3.2.S sections of the dossier for FTC provided by the applicant are identical to the 3.2.S sections 
submitted and approved with the aforementioned marketing authorisations. 
General information 
The chemical name of FTC is 4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]-1,2-
dihydropyrimidin-2-one and has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 11/162 
  
  
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, IR 
spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal x-ray determination. 
FTC appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely soluble in methanol and 
water. Its pKa is 2.65 and the partition coefficient Log P is -0.43. It has 2 chiral centres at carbons 2 and 5 of 
the oxathiolane ring. Two enantiomeric pairs of diastereomers can exist: cis-(-)-FTC and cis-(+)-FTC, trans-(-
)-FTC and trans-(+)-FTC. The synthetic route has been chosen to be stereoselective for the formation of the 
desired cis-(-) enantiomer, emtricitabine. Three polymorphs of FTC have been observed. However, the most 
stable thermodynamically form at room temperature, is consistently produced. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
FTC is manufactured by two possible synthetic routes sharing a common first step and followed by two 
options comprising either one or two extra steps. The synthesis was described in sufficient detail. 
The synthetic process results in the stereoselective formation of an intermediate and thus the formation of 
the desired FTC enantiomer. Five manufacturing sites are involved. Adequate in-process controls (IPCs) are 
applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents have been presented. The process has been shown to consistently produce FTC that 
meets the required quality standards. 
The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene (PE) bags inside HDPE drums which comply with the 
EC directives 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
FTC specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), clarity of solution 
(visual), water content (Ph. Eur.), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), heavy 
metals (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), and particle size (Laser Light 
Scattering). Analytical methods have been validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The testing and the 
proposed limits applied, conform to current ICH guidelines and are acceptable from a toxicological and clinical 
perspective. 
Extended testing during development has demonstrated that only a single polymorphic form results from the 
synthetic process of FTC. Therefore as per ICH Q6A, testing for polymorphic form at release is not necessary. 
Development data demonstrate the absence of indicator organisms and therefore, as per ICH Q6, microbial 
testing of the active substance is not required. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 22 commercial scale batches of the active substance from all proposed manufacturers 
were provided. The results comply with the specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of the 
manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 12/162 
  
  
 
Stability 
Thirteen commercial scale and additional pilot scale batches of FTC manufactured using both synthetic routes 
and packaged in the proposed container were put on stability testing in accordance with the ICH Q1A (R2) 
Guideline under long-term conditions (25 ºC/60% RH) for up to 36 months. Of the above batches, eight 
commercial scale and five pilot batches were stored under accelerated conditions (40 ºC/75% RH) for up to 6 
months. In addition another three batches were stored under intermediate conditions (30 ºC/65% RH) for up 
to 12 months. Samples were tested for appearance, impurities, assay, water content and enantiomeric purity 
by validated stability indicating methods. Stability data for FTC manufactured by both synthetic routes was 
comparable. The majority of tested parameters remained within the specification limits throughout the study 
period for all three stability conditions. In one isolated batch, one degradation product exceeded the 
specification limit at the last time point (36 months). The same degradation product is observed in FTC stored 
under accelerated conditions. Four batches stored under accelerated conditions exceeded the specification 
limit at 6 months. These data indicate that FTC should not be exposed to elevated temperatures for extended 
periods of time. 
A photostability study was conducted on one batch of FTC. The results showed no significant changes in 
appearance, purity, and impurity content and indicate that FTC is not sensitive to light. 
Based on the long-term stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions when the active 
substance is packed in the proposed packaging materials is considered acceptable. 
Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF fumarate) 
General information 
The chemical name of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF fumarate) is propan-2-yl N-[(S)-({[(2R)-1-(6-
amino-9H-purin-9-yl)propan-2-yl]-oxy}methyl)(phenoxy)phosphoryl]-L-alaninate, (2E)-but-2-enedioate 
(2:1) and has the following structure: 
The chemical structure of TAF fumarate has been adequately demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C, and 31P), mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, ultraviolet 
absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. 
The active substance is a white to off-white or tan, slightly hygroscopic powder. TAF fumarate is a BCS Class 
III compound, with pH-dependent aqueous. solubility decreasing with increasing basicity. It is soluble at low 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 13/162 
  
  
 
pH (pH 2.0), sparingly soluble at pH 3.8, and slightly soluble at pH values up to 8.0. TAF fumarate is freely 
soluble in methanol, soluble in ethanol, sparingly soluble in isopropanol and slightly soluble in acetone. 
Tenofovir alafenamide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. The chiral centre 
at the propyloxy- side chain is in the R-configuration. The absolute stereoconfiguration of the 
carbonylethylamino-substituent has the S-configuration at the alpha-carbon. The remaining stereocentre is 
located at the phosphorus atom and is in the S-onfiguration. Enantiomeric purity is monitored routinely by 
chiral HPLC. 
Polymorphism has been observed for TAF fumarate. A single polymorphic form is consistently generated 
through the manufacturing process and this form has been adequately characterised. 
The applicant has provided justification for TAF fumarate to be considered as a new active substance (NAS) 
on the basis of its unique chemical structure. However, both TAF fumarate and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
(TDF), which is a known active substance, are prodrugs being metabolised to the same major active 
metabolite tenofovir (TFV) in vivo. Therefore, both active substances share the same therapeutic moiety and 
as such, TAF fumarate is not considered a NAS on quality grounds. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
TAF fumarate is obtained from two manufacturers using the same synthetic route. 
During the evaluation procedure, the active substance starting materials were re-defined to ensure enough of 
the process is documented in the dossier in line with ICH Q11. Commercially available well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications are used. 
Adequate IPCs are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate 
products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Critical process parameters were identified using a 
risk assessment approach. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double-lined PE bags which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and 
EC 10/2011 as amended. The bags are held in HDPE drums (or other suitable secondary container) with lids 
of appropriate size and fitted with a security seal. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual examination), identity (IR, HPLC), 
identity of fumaric acid (HPLC), clarity of solution (visual examination), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC, HPLC-MS, GC), residual solvents (GC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), and melting 
point (Ph. Eur.). The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality 
attributes (CQAs). 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 14/162 
  
  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard 
used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (n=16 using the proposed commercial process; 13 of which were production scale and 3 
pilot scale) of the active substance, manufactured at both proposed manufacturing sites are provided. 
Additional batch analysis data for development batches used in pre-clinical pharmacokinetics and 
toxicological studies are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 6 commercial scale batches of active substance from the both proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (5 ºC) and for up 
to 24 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Results under stressed conditions for up to 6 months at 40 ºC / 75% RH on 5 batches were provided. 
Additionally, results for 4 days at 60 ºC / ambient RH, for 4 days at 50 ºC / ambient RH and for 4 days at -20 
ºC were also provided on one batch. 
Samples were tested for appearance, impurities, assay, water content, and solid state characteristics (XRD 
and melting point). The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Degradation products increased under accelerated conditions but remained within the specification. 
Photostability testing following ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch, indicating that the active 
substance is not photosensitive. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the both proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period at the recommended long term 
storage condition in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Descovy tablets are available in 2 strengths. The 200 mg FTC / 10 mg TAF tablet is grey, rectangular and 
debossed with 210 on one side and GSI on the other. The 200 mg FTC / 25 mg TAF tablet is blue, rectangular 
and debossed with 225 on one side and GSI on the other. The tablets are the same size and weight. 
The aim of development was to formulate a single tablet containing the required amounts of the two active 
substances. FTC is a BCS Class I compound with high aqueous solubility across the physiological pH range 
and high permeability. It hydrolyses in aqueous solution and to a small extent under warm moist conditions. 
TAF fumarate is a BCS Class III compound with high aqueous solubility and low permeability. The active 
substances were shown to be mutually compatible and stable in combination with excipients in stability 
studies. The choice of manufacturing process and excipients was based on the properties of the active 
substances.  
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 15/162 
  
  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. or other 
relevant standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
 The formulation evolved throughout development. The commercial formulation is the same as that used in 
phase III clinical trials which was shown to be equivalent to earlier clinical formulations by suitable bridging 
studies. 
The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of 
experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. The risk 
identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing 
processes as well as on the experience from formulation development and process design. The critical 
process parameters have been adequately identified. 
Both active substances dissolve rapidly from the formulated tablet across the physiological pH range. Various 
manufacturing parameters with potential to impact the dissolution rate were examined during development 
and have been set at levels guaranteed to produce Descovy tablets of the required quality. The dissolution 
method was developed in order to identify tablets manufactured outside of the defined process and its 
discriminatory power is considered adequate. 
The primary packaging is an HDPE bottle with PP continuous-thread, child-resistant cap and lined with an 
induction activated aluminium foil liner. Each bottle contains silica gel desiccant and a polyester coil. The 
materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  blending  of  excipients  followed  by  lubrication;  roller 
compaction;  milling  and  lubrication  of  granules;  compression;  film-coating;  packaging.  The  process  is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. Full validation will be carried out on commercial scale for 3 batches of each tablet 
strength  prior  to  release  to  the  market  and  a  suitable  process  validation  scheme  has  been  provided.  The 
control  strategy  consists  of  a  series  of  input  material  attributes,  PARs,  NORs  and  set-points  for  unit 
operations,  and  IPCs.  The  IPCs  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process.  Adequate  justification 
for holding times of bulk intermediates has been provided and is discussed in the stability section. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications are appropriate for this kind of dosage form and include tests for 
appearance,  identification  (UV,  HPLC),  water  content  (KF),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). Limits for 
specific impurities are set in line with manufacturing batch data and levels qualified clinically, in line with ICH 
Q3B(R2).The  CHMP  considers  that  the  dissolution  specification  is  wide  compared  to  the  batch  results 
available  to  date  and  the  applicant  is  recommended  to  tighten  these  if  appropriate  once  additional 
commercial scale manufacturing experience has been gained.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for five production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three production scale batches of each strength stored for up to 18 months under long term 
conditions (25 °C / 60% RH), for up to 18 months under intermediate conditions (30 °C / 75% RH),  and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) in line with the ICH guidelines was provided. 
The batches of finished product are identical to and packaged in the same primary packaging as those 
proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for appearance, strength, degradation products, dissolution, 
water content and microbiological quality. All attributes were within their specification limits throughout the 
study period. No trends were observed for any of the measured parameters except for TAF strength, assay 
and degradation products. An increase in TAF degradation products was observed, larger in the 200/10 mg 
tablets than the 200/25, and more significant as storage temperature and humidity increase. This is 
accompanied by a related drop in TAF assay and TAF strength. No degradation of the FTC component was 
noted under any condition.  
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  No  changes  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  were 
observed,  save  for  a  slight  increase  in  water  as  the  tablets  were  exposed  unprotected  from  atmospheric 
moisture. 
Stressed  studies  were  carried  out  to  evaluate  conditions  which  may  be  experienced  during  shipping  and 
handling. Studies were conducted on one batch of each strength in both primary and bulk packaging at -20 
oC for 4 days and at 50 or 60 oC for 7 days. No changes to any of the measured parameters were observed 
other  than  a  slight  increase  in  TAF  degradation  products  at  the  higher  temperature.  All  parameters  were 
within their specification limits. 
Studies on bulk storage of intermediate products, powder blend, tablet cores, and film-coated tablets under 
warehouse  conditions  (20-25  oC  /  30-60%  RH)  were  also  carried  out.  Results  support  the  proposed  bulk 
holding times for powder blend, tablet cores and film-coated tablets. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without specific storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. The magnesium stearate is of vegetable 
origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of

important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The dissolution specification should be revised and tightened in line with batch data, if appropriate, 
once additional commercial scale manufacturing experience has been gained. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Emtricitabine (FTC) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), and intracellularly it is 
phosphorylated to the active metabolite, emtricitabine triphosphate which has activity against HIV and 
hepatitis B virus.  
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), and after absorption TAF is converted to TFV 
intracellularly, which is phosphorylated to the active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), that 
competes with natural 2’-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) for incorporation by the HIV-1 or HBV reverse 
transcriptase (RT) and, once incorporated, results in chain-termination.  TAF differs from tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (TDF) as it is more stable in human plasma than TDF despite rapidly undergoing intracellular 
conversion to TFV. Treatment with TAF results in higher levels of TFV-DP in PBMCs and 90% lower circulating 
levels of TFV relative to TDF.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacology to examine the antiviral activity of FTC and TAF have been described in the 
virology summary section in the dossier and so the following is only discussed briefly in respect to the 
relevant non-clinical aspects. Considering there have been extensive previous reviews for each component 
and a similar product known as Stilbild (STB) where TAF is substituted for TDF only a limited review for 
primary pharmacology for the TAF component has been undertaken. 
FTC: 
Emtricitabine (FTC) is a synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside, 2′-deoxycytidine.  
Intracellularly, FTC is converted through 3 phosphorylation reactions to its active tri-phosphorylated anabolite 
FTC-TP.   
Emtricitabine triphosphate inhibits viral polymerases by direct binding competition with the natural 
deoxyribonucleotide substrate (deoxycytidine triphosphate; dCTP), and after incorporation into DNA, by DNA 
chain termination.  Published literature describes that the EC50 of FTC against laboratory adapted strains of 
HIV-1 ranged from 0.001 to 0.62 µM depending on cell type and virus strain used in the assay.  With clinical 
isolates of HIV-1, EC50 values ranged from 0.002 to 0.028 µM.   
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016

In vivo animal studies have been completed with FTC or FTC in combination to demonstrate its activity 
against immune deficiency in the macaque monkey.  Macaques were infected with the simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and 50 days post-inoculation animals were treated subcutaneously with either 
TFV (20 mg/kg) and FTC (50 mg/kg) or were not given any drugs. The treated macaques achieved SIV levels 
that were below the limit of detection (ie, < 100 copies/mL of viral RNA), whereas only 1 of the non-treated 
macaques showed a decrease in SIV RNA.  SIV levels remained low in all treated animals for up to 6 months.   
In another study, monkeys were exposed to 14 weekly doses of SHIV (SIV/HIV chimeric virus).  Rhesus 
macaques were injected subcutaneously with TFV/FTC daily, at 2 hours before and 24 hours after the first 
virus exposure or at 2 hours before first virus exposure only. Twenty of the 21 control animals became 
infected, however all 6 of animals treated with TFV/FTC daily or before and 24 hours after the first challenge 
were fully protected after 14 challenges.  In the single-dose group, 1 of 6 animals was infected, confirming 
that multiple dose therapy was highly effective at protecting these animals against rectal transmission of HIV.   
TAF: 
Tenofovir alafenamide is hydrolysed to tenofovir (TFV) by the lysosomal carboxypeptidase, Cathepsin A 
(CatA).  To investigate the intracellular activity of TAF in lymphoid cells and tissues, CD4+ T lymphocytes and 
monocyte-derived macrophage (MDMs) were isolated from PBMCs from viable donors (Study No. PC-120-
2017) and extent of CatA activity determined by measuring the rate of conversion of TAF to TFV-alanine 
(Figure 1).  Level of active CatA was similar across all donors, as was the rate of conversion from TAF to TFV-
alanine in CD4+ cells. Cathepsin A activity was approximately 2-fold greater in MDMs compared with CD4+ T 
cells.  There was conversion of TAF to TFV-DP across both cell types in all donor extracts,    
As shown in Figure 1, TAF is hydrolysed to TFV, and is then metabolised to the active metabolite, TFV-DP, 
which is an inhibitor of HIV-1, HIV-2 and HBV polymerases, and is an inhibitor of HIV-1 RT that competes 
with deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) for incorporation into nascent DNA and terminates the elongation 
of the viral DNA chain during the process of retroviral reverse transcription, thereby effectively blocking the 
replication and spread of infectious HIV.  
In vitro studies have shown that TAF has anti-HIV activity in lymphoid T-cells, primary human PBMCs, and 
macrophages with EC50 values ranging from 3 to 14 nM. The in vitro activity of TAF against HIV-1 is 100- to 
600-fold greater than TFV and 4- to 6-fold greater than TDF (Robbins et al. 1998).  
In MT-2 cells, TAF shows low cytotoxicity with a selectivity index (SI) of > 10,000).  Based on data generated 
with the parent nucleotide TFV, TAF is expected to be active against a wide range of HIV-1 subtypes and also 
against HIV-2. In addition, TAF is a potent inhibitor of HBV replication, exhibiting in vitro activity comparable 
to that of TDF with an EC50 value of 18 nM.

Following incubation for 4 hours with 1μM TAF, the formation and quantity of intracellular TAF metabolites in CD4+ T cells (A) and MDMs (B) were determined by 
HPLC combined with mass spectrometry. 
Further work has also been completed to evaluate the interaction potential of TAF with other CatA inhibitors 
such as HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) (Study No. PC-120-2001).  The HIV PIs DRV, ATV, lopinavir (LPV), and 
RTV, as well as the pharmacoenhancing agent COBI, did not inhibit CatA-mediated hydrolysis of TAF up to a 
concentration of 50 μM, well above the clinical Cmax of each drug.  In a similar manner the potential for 
interaction with HCV PIs - TMC-435, BI-201355, MK-5172, GS-9256, and GS-9451 showed little-to-no 
inhibition of CatA, with IC50 values ranging from 25 to > 50 μM.  2 irreversible inhibitors of the HCV protease, 
telaprevir and boceprevir, were identified as potent inhibitors of CatA-mediated hydrolysis of TAF, with IC 50 
values of 0.3 and 0.2 μM, respectively.  When adjusted for plasma binding, these IC50 values are 6- to 8-fold 
below the clinical maximum concentration (Cmax) levels observed in patients.

No in vivo work with TAF was conducted however this has been completed with the active component of TAF, 
TFV.  Monkeys received a single dose of 30 mg/kg radiolabelled TFV subcutaneously, and the extent of TFV in 
plasma and levels of intracellular TFV and TFV metabolite concentrations were determined.  The TFV 
concentration in plasma reached a maximum of approximately 50 µM and declined with a t1/2 of 5 to 7 
hours.  As was seen in the in vitro studies, TFV is efficiently taken up by PBMCs and is metabolised to TFV-
DP, with the intracellular concentrations of the active metabolite TFV-DP reaching 0.9 µM. 
FTC/TAF 
No additional studies for the F/TAF FDC were conducted in animal models in view of the extensive clinical 
experience with the use of FTC, and TDF, FTC/TDF containing regimens, and the E/C/F/TAF FDC for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The ability FTC or TAF (TFV) to affect anti-viral activity of other anti-retrovirals has been explored in detail, 
reviewing in vitro cytotoxicity, mitochondrial toxicity, off target activity and potential metabolic toxicities.  
FTC: 
For FTC, no cytotoxicity was observed in vitro in human PBMC, MT-2, HepG2, CEM, MOLT-4, and Vero cells at 
concentrations up to 100 µM.  FTC was also found to be nontoxic to human bone marrow progenitor cells in 
vitro.  
The potential for mitochondrial toxicity with FTC was evaluated.  FTC was incubated with HepG2 cells at 
concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 10 µM for 2 weeks, and MT-2 cells were incubated with FTC at 
concentrations up to 100 µM for up to 8 weeks (Study No. TPI 11963, non-GLP).  FTC had no adverse effects 
on cell growth, mitochondrial DNA synthesis, or lactic acid production. Further studies confirmed this finding.   
The inhibition of mitochondrial DNA synthesis was also assessed in an in vitro cell culture assay using Molt-4 
cells (a T-lymphoblast cell line) (Study No. TGZZ/93/0016 and TGZZ/93/0023, non-GLP). FTC did not reduce 
the ratio of mitochondrial to cellular DNA when tested at concentrations of up to 100 µM after 7 days of 
continuous cell exposure. 
FTC had no significant binding affinity at 19 different receptors (Study No. TPZZ/93/0002, non-GLP), has 
shown little or no direct effect on various isolated muscle preparations (cholinergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, 
and serotonergic), and had no major inhibitory effects on the contractile responses to acetylcholine, 
norepinephrine, serotonin, isoproterenol, arachidonic acid, histamine, bradykinin, and angiotensin II (Study 
No. TPZZ/92/0055, non-GLP). 
TAF/TFV: 
A range of studies have been completed to examine the potential secondary effects of TAF, utilising studies 
already completed for TFV.  
The cytotoxicity profiles (CC50 values) of TAF, its stereoisomer GS-7339, TDF, and TFV were investigated in 
resting and dividing human PBMCs following 5 days of continuous drug incubation (Study No. PC-120-2009, 
non-GLP). The maximum concentrations of drugs used were 100, 100, 50, and 2000 μM, for TAF, GS-7339, 
TDF, and TFV, respectively.  TAF doses used in this in vitro study were supra-therapeutic in concentration 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 22/162 
  
  
and duration. CC50 values for TAF ranged from 6.8 μM in dividing PBMCs to 25.1 μM in resting PBMCs.  TAF 
showed low cytotoxicity in resting and in dividing PBMCs.   
The cytotoxicity profiles (CC50 values) of TAF, TDF, TFV, and a panel of clinically relevant antiretroviral 
inhibitors were also evaluated in 2 T-lymphoblastoid cell lines (MT-2 and MT-4) following 5 days of exposure 
(Study No. PC-120-2007, non-GLP), TAF showed low cytotoxicity in T-lymphoblastoid cells providing ≥ 1997-
fold increased selectivity relative to antiviral activity in T-lymphoblastoid cell lines. Similarly TAF 
demonstrated low cytotoxicity to hepatic cells (Study No. PC-120-2007, non-GLP). 
Tenofovir alafenamide also showed little to no effect on erythroid and myeloid progenitor proliferation in vitro 
(Study No. PC-120-2016, non-GLP). 
TFV exhibited low levels of cytotoxicity in resting and activated human PBMCs, and in an established T-
lymphocyte cell line, with CC50 values >1 mM.  Similar findings for TFV were observed in HepG2 cells, 
skeletal muscle cells of human origin, and in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs). Similarly, 
TFV has shown no effect on haematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro (Study No. PC-120-2016, non-GLP).  
Overall TFV has a low order of cytotoxicity in vitro. 
The cytotoxicity of TAF and TFV was assessed in human HEK293T cells transiently expressing OAT1 and OAT3 
(Study No. PC-120-2018, non-GLP).  Cells were incubated with serial dilutions of TFV or TAF for 4 days.  TAF 
did not interact with the renal organic anion transporters 1 or 3 (OAT1 or OAT3), and TAF exhibited no OAT-
dependent cytotoxicity in human epithelial kidney cells transiently expressing these transporters.  In addition, 
the selectivity index (considering CC50 in renal HEK293 cells expressing OAT1 or OAT3 relative to EC50 in 
primary CD4+ T lymphocytes) for TAF (29,000 and 4270, respectively) was much higher than for TFV (14 
and 82, respectively).  As a result TAF is unlikely to accumulate in renal proximal tubules in an OAT-
dependent manner, supporting the hypothesis that it has the potential for an improved renal safety profile.   
When primary osteoblasts and PBMCs were treated with TAF doses consistent with human therapeutic 
exposure, comparable TFV-DP levels were achieved (Study No. PC-120-2008).  At these therapeutically 
relevant doses of TAF, there were no in vitro effects on cell viability with primary osteoblasts or PBMCs. 
Similar to the other components in E/C/F/TAF FDC, the impact of TAF on mitochondrial toxicity was assessed.  
Previous studies have demonstrated a minimal effect of TFV on the mitochondrial DNA synthesis in vitro.  The 
potential for TAF to induce mitochondrial DNA depletion was evaluated in HepG2 cells (Study No. PC-120-
2006, non-GLP). HepG2 cells treated with TAF (0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 μM) for 10 days exhibited no significant 
reduction in mitochondrial DNA compared with untreated cells.   
No effect of TFV was seen on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or lactic acid production in HepG2 human 
liver cells or in normal human skeletal muscle cells (SkMCs) (Study No. P1278-00042, non-GLP). The results 
confirm the low potential for TFV to interfere with mitochondrial functions. 
Combinations: 
The combination of TFV and FTC was studied for cytotoxicity in MT-2 cells.  No cytotoxicity was observed at 
the highest concentrations tested, up to 50 µM TFV and 5 µM FTC (Study No. PC-164-2002, non-GLP).  
Cytotoxicity studies were also conducted on the combination of TFV and FTC in HepG2 cells to evaluate their 
potential combined mitochondrial toxicity; no cytotoxicity was observed (Study No. TX-104-2001, non-GLP). 
Given the lack of effects in the in vitro studies with the individual agents or with other combinations, no 
additional secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted for the F/TAF combination.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Both in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies have been completed for FTC, and TAF. No studies were 
conducted to examine the F/TAF combination. 
FTC: 
Cardiovascular System: 
In vitro the effects of FTC on cardiac preparations was evaluated using isolated cardiac muscle from rat, 
guinea pigs and cats (Study No. TPZZ/92/0056, non-GLP). Results from these in vitro studies suggested that 
FTC was free of negative cardiac effects at 1 µM. 
No effects on the cardiovascular system were reported in anesthetised dogs administered a cumulative dose 
of 38.5 mg/kg of FTC intravenously over a 1-hour period (Study No. TPZZ/92/0076, non-GLP). Rats given 
oral doses of up to 250 mg/kg FTC showed no effect on heart rate or blood pressure (Study No. 
TPZZ/92/0057, non-GLP). In addition, there were no abnormalities reported on the ECG data obtained from 
the repeated-dose toxicity studies in monkeys, where AUC exposures were up to 26-fold higher than in 
humans at 200 mg.   
Central Nervous System: 
A range of central nervous system effects were examined in a single study conducted with male ICR rats 
(Study No. 477, non-GLP).  Mice (10/dose) were given FTC orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg 
as a single dose. FTC did not affect reflex, spontaneous locomotion, motor coordination, anticonvulsant 
activity, proconvulsant activity or analgesic activity at any dose tested.   
A further two studies in rats examined the effects of FTC on reflexes, analgesic activity and conditioned 
avoidance (Study Nos. TPZZ/93/0001 and TPZZ/93/0119, non-GLP).  FTC had no effect on these parameters.  
Respiratory System: 
Effects of FTC on the respiratory system have been examined in mice, rats and dogs. In mice (Study No. 
TPZZ/93/0001, GLP) and rats (Study No. TPZZ/93/0001, GLP), animals were exposed to up to 1000 mg/kg of 
oral FTC with no effect on respiratory rate at any dose. In dogs (Study No. TPZZ/92/0076, GLP), male beagle 
dogs were intravenously administered FTC at 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg (cumulative dose = 38.5 mg/kg) 
over an hour.  No changes were observed on respiratory function at any dose.   
Gastrointestinal: 
Male ICR mice (10/dose) were given FTC orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg, then given a 
charcoal suspension orally at 1 hour post-dose.  Emtricitabine did not affect GI motility at any dose (Study 
No. 477, non-GLP).

Renal:  
Male Long Evans-derived rats were given FTC orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg and urine 
was collected for 6 hours post-dose. FTC did not affect urine output, pH, or electrolyte excretion at any dose 
(Study No. 477, non-GLP). 
TAF: 
In vivo safety pharmacology experiments were conducted using TAF as the monofumarate form (GS-7340-
02) in 50 mM citric acid. In the in vitro hERG assay, TAF as GS-7340-03 was dissolved in DMSO and diluted 
with HEPES-buffered physiological saline to a final concentration of 0.3% DMSO. 
Cardiovascular System: 
TAF (as GS-7340-03) was evaluated at concentrations of 1 and 10 μM (free base equivalents [fbe]), and 
hERG inhibition was not significant. The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of TAF on hERG was estimated to be 
greater than 10 μM (Study No. PC-120-2005, GLP).  
Oral administration of TAF (as GS-7340-02) to conscious instrumented male beagle dogs at doses of 30 or 
100 mg/kg (24 and 80 mg fbe/kg) did not induce pharmacologic effects on heart rate, systemic blood 
pressure, or ECGs (Study No. D2000006, GLP). 
Central Nervous System: 
The effect of TAF on the central nervous system has been examined in GLP Study No. R990188 using male 
SD rats. Animals were treated with single oral doses of TAF (as the monofumarate form) with doses of 0, 100 
or 1000 mg/kg (80 or 800 mg free base equivalents [fbe]/kg). There was no evidence of any effect on the 
CNS at any dose tested up to 1000 mg/kg.   
Gastrointestinal: 
SD rats were administered TAF (as GS-7340-02) by oral gavage at doses of 0, 100 or 1000 mg/kg (0, 80 or 
800 mg fbe/kg).  At the highest dose the rate of gastric emptying was reduced, although this was not 
observed at 100 mg/kg (80 mg fbe/kg). A dose of 100 mg/kg was considered to have had no effect on 
gastric emptying or intestinal motility. (Study No. R990187, GLP). 
Renal:  
The effect of TAF (as GS-7340-02) on the renal system was evaluated in male SD rats following 
administration of single oral doses of 0, 100, or 1000 mg/kg (80 or 800 mg free base equivalents [fbe]/kg) 
(Study No. R990186, GLP). Urinary output of calcium was increased at 1000 mg/kg, however this was 
correlated with an increase in serum calcium concentration and indicated that the kidneys were functioning 
well in order to reduce the serum calcium load. The no-effect dose for a pharmacological effect on the renal 
system was 1000 mg/kg.

Combination  
From the cardiovascular studies with TAF, there is potential for PR interval to be prolonged, as seen in the 39 
week dog study at 18/12 mg/kg/day. This change was observed to be associated with decreased weight gain, 
bone and renal toxicity, and significant decreases in triiodothyronine (T3). In the safety pharmacology study 
in dogs however there was no evidence of PR prolongation or any change in ECG results in doses of up to 
1000 mg/kg. Results from the clinical thorough QT study also have revealed no cardiac signal. 
As there has been a comprehensive program for each of the four components in respect of safety 
pharmacology, no studies have been conducted with the combination in accordance with CHMP guidance 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). There is sufficient knowledge of the individual components to assess 
potential overlaps in safety risks, and the results do not warrant additional investigation of the combination. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of FTC, and TFV/TAF were evaluated in vitro and in a 
variety of animal models in vivo. In addition, the drug-drug interaction profile was also evaluated.  The 
pharmacokinetics of the FTC/TAF FDC is discussed based on the results of non-clinical studies completed with 
the individual agents, no additional pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted for the FTC/TAF 
combination. 
Methods of analysis 
FTC: The in vivo pharmacokinetic, toxicokinetics, distribution, and excretion of FTC were assessed in mouse, 
rat, and monkey.  Analytical methods used to quantify FTC in mouse, rat, and monkey plasma from the early 
preclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies employed reverse-phase high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and HPLC-MS (plasma and urine).  LC-radio-profiling has been 
utilised to detect [3H]FTC in mice and monkeys, and to detect [14C]FTC in rats and monkeys.  
TAF: The in vivo pharmacokinetic, toxicokinetics, distribution, and excretion of TAF were assessed in mouse, 
rat, dog, and monkey.  The in vitro absorption, metabolism, and drug interaction characteristics of TAF were 
studied in appropriate model systems.  Levels of TAF and TFV in rats and dog plasma and PBMCs were 
determined using fluorescence derivitization/HPLC.  Additional methods to detect levels of TAF and TFV in 
mouse, rat, rabbit and dog plasma/PMBCs included validated LC/MS/MS methods, and HPLC detection 
methods.  The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of TAF were assessed in various species 
following a single oral administration of [14C]TAF, and levels of TAF and its metabolites were measured using 
LSC, HPLC or LC/MS/MS coupled with flow-through detector (RFD).  In vitro determination of TAF levels were 
in the main determined by LC/MS/MS, with some LC-radio-profiling.  Induction potential of TAF on CYP 
activity measured mRNA levels using qRT PCR methods.  
FTC/TAF: In vitro transporter methods were developed to measure the impact of FTC and TFV on various 
transporter assays.  Validation reports are supplied to support the use of MDCKII and CHO cells, as well as 
assays using vesicular preparations.

Absorption  
FTC: 
No in vitro permeability studies have been carried out with FTC, as FTC shows high, dose-independent 
bioavailability in vivo in mice and monkeys.  Single-dose pharmacokinetics of FTC have been studied in mice, 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys.  FTC was rapidly and well absorbed with oral bioavailability ranging from 58% 
to 97% over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg/kg. 
The multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for FTC were derived as part of the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in mice (80 to 3000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX109; IUW00701; TOX599; TOX628), in rats (60 to 
3000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX108; TOX097), and monkeys (40 to 2000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX600; 
TOX627; TOX032) dosed for periods of 3 days to 104 weeks.  There were no significant differences in 
pharmacokinetics following single and multiple dosing. Exposure to FTC (Cmax and AUC) increased 
approximately proportionally with dose and was similar between males and females. 
TAF: 
In vitro: Permeability of TAF was examined using Caco-2 cells (Study No. AD-120-2037).  TAF was applied to 
monolayers of these cells at 10, 100, and 1000 µM, and TAF showed a dose dependent increase in forward 
permeability and a decrease in efflux ratio indicating saturable efflux transport. Addition of the efflux 
transport inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA) diminished the efflux ratio and increased the permeability.   
Mouse: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in mice.  
In the single dose pharmacokinetic study in mice, TAF/TFV were evaluated following administration of TAF by 
dosing either GS-7340-02 or GS-7340-03 to male CD-1 mice or GS-7340-03 to both male and female 
001178-W mice via oral gavage (Study Nos. AD-120-2014 and AD-120-2016).  
Tenofovir exposure increased with the increase in dose and was greater than dose proportional between 10 
to 100 mg/kg (Table 3.2.1). Gender differences in plasma TFV levels were less than 2-fold in Cmax and 
AUC0-t values (Table 3.2.2). The pharmacokinetic profiles for the 2 different fumarate forms of TAF were 
observed to be generally similar.

Table 2.  Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of GS-7340-03 to 001178-W Wild type 
Mice 
GS-7340-02 was administered by oral gavage for up to 14 days to male and female mice at a dose of 100, 
500, or 1000 mg/kg/day (Study No. TX-120-2006). Due to early death for animals given 500 or 1000 
mg/kg/day, only the 100 mg/kg/day dose group was evaluated. GS-7340 at 100 mg/kg/day corresponded to 
a Day 14 Cmax of 27.1 and 2.89 ng/mL for males and females, respectively; the AUC0-24 could not be 
calculated due to the lack of a distinct elimination phase. GS-7340 rapidly converted to its metabolite, TFV.  
There were no significant differences in TFV pharmacokinetic profiles between males and females. 
Following daily administration of GS-7340-02 to mice via oral gavage for at least 13 weeks at doses of 0, 10, 
30, and 100 mg/kg/day, the pharmacokinetic parameters for TAF and TFV were determined (Study No. TX-
120-2007). Exposure to TFV increased with the increase in GS-7340-02 dose from 10 to 100 mg/kg/day. The 
increases in Cmax and AUC0-t were generally greater than proportional between the 10 to 100 mg/kg/day 
dose levels. Gender-based differences were less than 2-fold in TFV Cmax and AUC0-t values. There was no 
sign of accumulation of TFV after multiple dosing, and there is rapid and extensive conversion of TAF to TFV 
after oral administration in mice. 
Rat: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in rats.  
In the single dose pharmacokinetic study in rats, the two forms of TAF (GS-7340-02 and GS-7340-03) were 
again compared, as was the exposure to TFV between TAF and TDF (Study Nos. R990130, AD-120-2015, and 
R2000065). TAF was rapidly absorbed and generation of the major metabolite TFV was observed with a T max 
of less than 1 hour (Table 3). TFV exposure increased in a greater than dose proportional manner. There no 
significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two forms of TAF, GS-7340-02 and GS-
7340-03.

In a comparison between exposure of TFV generated due to TAF or TDF (Study No. R20000065), rats were 
treated orally with a single dose of 400 mg/kg of TAF (GS-7340-02) or TDF. The plasma Cmax and AUC for 
TFV were 2- to 3-fold higher with 400 mg/kg TAF compared to 400 mg/kg TDF. 
The plasma pharmacokinetic profile of TFV was determined during the course of a 28 day oral gavage toxicity 
study in adult male and female albino rats following daily administration of either 1.5, 6.25, 25, 100 or 400 
mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 (Study No. R990182). A greater than dose proportional increase in exposure was 
observed.  There was no evidence of accumulation.  
In a 26-week toxicology study, GS-7340-02 was administered once daily at doses of 0 (vehicle only), 5, 25 
and 100 mg/kg/day by oral gavage and plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of TFV were determined on Day 
1 and during Weeks 13 and 26 (Study No. TOX-120-001). No consistent differences in plasma 
pharmacokinetic parameters were found between male and female rats.  Mean tenofovir Cmax and AUC 
values increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 5 to 100 mg/kg/day. Mean TFV AUC obtained on 
Day 1 was slightly lower than that measured during Weeks 13 and 26, which suggested that there was a 
slight accumulation of tenofovir with repeat dosing. 
Dog: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in dogs.  
In Study No. 99-DDM-1278-001-PK the effect on pharmacokinetic parameters due to changes in the stereo 
configuration, fumarate form, food, and the route of administration was examined. In this study Beagle dogs 
were administered TAF as a single IV bolus (GS-7340-02 [6.3 mg/kg]), or oral administration (TAF as free 
base [18.0 mg/kg], its diastereomer GS-7339 [18.0 mg/kg], the mixture GS-7171 [16.0 mg/kg], or GS-
7340-02 [4,8, 5.0, and 20 mg/kg under fasted and 5.0 mg/kg under fed conditions]). Following oral 
administration, TAF and its diasteroisomer were rapidly absorbed and eliminated with a t max of less than 0.5 
h and t½ ranging from 0.2-0.9 h.  The plasma exposures to the intact prodrugs were similar when TAF or 
GS-7339 were dosed separately, however, when the isomeric mixture, GS-7171, was dosed, the exposure to 
GS-7339 was approximately 3-fold higher than TAF.  TFV exposure was similar for both diasteroisomers, 
although exposure in PBMCs was higher following dosing with TAF than with GS-7339.  The effect of food led 
to a decrease in overall plasma exposure of TFV and TAF (2.5 fold).   
When male Beagle dogs were given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg TAF, there was rapid absorption and 
elimination, t max was less than 0.5 h and t½ ranged from 0.2-0.9 h. The pharmacologically active metabolite, 
TFV-DP was the major metabolite in liver achieving a Cmax of 126 µM at 4.0 hours posdose. 
Following daily oral administration of 8.29 mg/kg TAF for 7 days to male Beagle dogs, the plasma and liver 
pharmacokinetic profiles were determined on day 1 and 7 (Study No. AD-120-2033). TAF was rapidly 
absorbed and exhibited a short terminal half-life (t½) of 0.3 hours in plasma on both Day 1 and 7.  The rapid 
disappearance of TAF was accompanied by an increase in TFV. Tenofovir was the major metabolite detected 
in plasma achieving a maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of 1.47 and 2.12 μM on Day 1 and 7, 
respectively.  The pharmacologically active diphosphate metabolite, TFV-DP, was efficiently formed in dog 
livers achieving concentrations of 242 and 153 μM at 4.0 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 7, respectively. 
The plasma PK of TAF and TFV and TFV levels in PBMCs were determined during the course of a 28-day oral 
gavage toxicity study in adult male and female beagle dogs following daily administration of either vehicle, 
0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10 mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 (Study No. D990175-PK). Repeat dosing at 10 mg/kg/day 
resulted in nonlinear pharmacokinetics between Days 1 and 28 with TAF median AUC values of 0.454 and 
0.985 μg·h/mL, Cmax values of 582 and 1280 ng/mL, and t½ λz values of 18 and 23 minutes, respectively.  
The TFV Cmax values appeared to be linear with increasing dose as well as repeat dosing. The TFV t½ was 
estimated to be 37 h and substantial accumulation of TFV was observed after repeat dosing. The TFV levels in 
Assessment report

PBMCs were not linear with increasing dose; however, a linear correlation was observed between TFV levels 
in PBMCs and corresponding trough plasma concentrations. PBMC concentrations were approximately 100-
fold higher than corresponding plasma concentrations. 
In a 9-month toxicology study in dog, GS-7340-02 was administered once daily at doses of 0, 2, 6, and 18 
mg/kg/day (Study No. TOX-120-002).  he dose of 18 mg/kg/day was decreased to 12 mg/kg/day on Day 2 
of Week 7 for males and Day 2 of Week 8 for females due to severe clinical signs and reduced body weight 
and food consumption.  The concentrations of GS-7340 and tenofovir in plasma samples and total TFV in 
Week 39/40 PBMC samples were determined.  GS-7340 was rapidly absorbed and converted to tenofovir 
following oral dose administration, with peak plasma concentrations of GS-7340 and tenofovir occurring at 
0.5 and 1 hour post-dose, respectively. GS-7340 was eliminated rapidly from the plasma with a terminal 
phase half-life of less than 1 hour.  The median t½ of tenofovir was estimated to be in the range of 25 to 31 
hours on Day 1. The plasma pharmacokinetics of GS-7340 and tenofovir were comparable between male and 
female dogs after oral administration.  Plasma Cmax and AUC values for TAF increased more than 
proportionally over the dose range of 2 to 18/12 mg/kg/day.  The plasma TFV Cmax and AUC increased 
roughly dose proportional. There was some accumulation of tenofovir following repeat dosing (~3-fold). 
Tenofovir concentrations in PBMCs were measurable at 24-hour post-dose for all dose groups. The median 
terminal phase half-life of total tenofovir in PBMCs was estimated to be 31 hours (similar to the tenofovir 
plasma estimate) from the recovery animals with PBMC concentrations measured up to 72 hours. Dose-
normalized PBMC mean AUC values of total tenofovir increased more than dose proportionally during Week 
39/40. 
Monkey: 
Single dose pharmacokinetics for TAF and TFV, and TFV in PBMCs was determined using rhesus monkeys 
administered single oral doses of GS-7340-02 at 0.5, 5.0, and 50 mg/kg (Study No. P2000087).  Tenofovir 
alafenamide and TFV levels increased rapidly with t max values of approximately 0.5 and 1 hour, respectively 
(Table 4). Levels of TFV in PBMCs were also detected, levels of TFV persisted in PBMCs for up to 96 h and 
persisted to a higher extent to samples treated with acid phosphatase suggesting that a significant proportion 
of TFV-related material in PBMCs was in phosphorylated forms (Table 5).

Table 5.  Concentrations of TFV in PBMCs from Monkeys Dosed with GS-7340-02 
Following daily oral administration of GS-7340-02 at 0, 3, and 30 mg/kg/day or TFV at 15 mg/kg/day for 28 
days, pharmacokinetic profiles of TAF and/or TFV were determined on Day 1, Day 14 and Day 28 (Study No. 
P2000114-PK). No significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were found between males and 
females.  The pharmacokinetic parameters for TFV were dose linear on Day 1 but were greater than dose-
linear on Day 28 after oral administration of GS-7340-02. There was no statistically significant accumulation 
of TFV following repeat dosing of either GS-7340-02 or TFV. The intracellular TFV concentrations in PBMCs 
were determined from the 30 mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 dose group where 72.3 and 27.2 µg/mL were detected 
on Day 14 and Day 28, respectively. 
FTC/TAF: 
Potential drug interactions within the combination could affect absorption, FTC shows high passive 
permeability and is unlikely to be affected when administered with TAF. Tenofovir alafenamide is a efflux 
substrate in the intestine; therefore, absorption is increased in the presence of COBI due to inhibition of 
intestinal efflux transport.  
Non-clinical studies of the absorption kinetics of the F/TAF FDC have not been conducted; however this has 
been assessed in appropriate clinical studies with the combination. 
Distribution 
FTC: 
The protein binding of FTC was very low (< 5%) in mouse, rabbit, monkey, and human plasma (Study No. 
TBZZ/93/0025). The tissue distribution of [14C]FTC was characterised in rats and cynomolgus monkeys after 
a single oral dose of 200 mg/kg (Study Nos. TOX092 and TOX063, respectively). Distribution was extensive 
and rapid; levels were detected within 1 h post oral administration. There was no sign of FTC accumulation 
and elimination was rapid, no radioactivity was observed after 72 hours post-dose.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters for FTC in pregnant animals appeared to be generally similar to those reported 
for non-pregnant animals 
TAF/TFV: 
The extent of binding of TAF to plasma protein was determined using dog and human plasma only (Study No. 
AD-120-2026). Rat plasma was not included as TAF is highly unstable in rat plasma due to the presence of a 
high number of esterases. Protein binding of TAF was moderate in dog and human plasma with the percent 
unbound values of 48.0% and 46.8%, respectively. The in vitro values are slightly higher than those 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016

observed using ex vivo samples from TAF treated humans which ranged from 14 – 23%.  For the use in the 
interaction studies, the percentage of unbound TAF was round up to be 20%.  
The protein binding of TFV has been determined in human plasma and serum using centrifugal ultrafiltration 
(Study No. P0504-00039.1). Percent of unbound TFV was 99.3 ± 3.3% in human plasma, and 92.8 ± 3.6% 
in human serum.  Tenofovir therefore showed very low protein binding in either human plasma or serum. 
Extensive tissue distribution studies with TAF were completed using mice, rats and dogs.  
Male CD-1 mice were treated with a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study No. AD-120-2011).  Most 
tissues reached maximum concentration by 1 hour post-dose.  The tissues showing the highest maximum 
concentrations of radioactivity, excluding GI tract, included liver, gall bladder, urinary bladder, diaphragm, 
kidney cortex, kidneys, and kidney medulla.  The tissues with the lowest Cmax values were testis, brain 
cerebrum, fat (abdominal), spinal cord, and brain medulla.  Similar distribution profiles were seen in male 
C57 Black (pigmented) mice.  More persistent exposures in eye lens, eye uveal tract, and eyes were 
observed in CD57 black mice compared to CD-1 mice, although there was no indication that there was a 
difference in distribution between pigmented and non-pigmented skin, or that TAF was more preferentially 
distributed to melanin-containing tissues. 
Male SD or Long Evans rats were administered oral 5 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study AD-120-2020).  There was 
rapid distribution to most tissues, both to pigmented and non-pigmented rats.  The tissues showing the 
highest maximum concentrations of radioactivity included kidney cortex, kidney(s), kidney medulla, and liver.  
The tissues with the lowest Cmax values were brain olfactory lobe, seminal vesicle(s), eye vitreous humour, 
thymus, eyes, testis(es), and harderian gland for Sprague-Dawley rats and bone, brain olfactory lobe, 
seminal vesicle(s), fat (abdominal), muscle, eye vitreous humour, and eye(s) for Long Evans rats.  There was 
no indication that there was any difference in distribution between pigmented and nonpigmented animals, 
binding to melanin was unlikely.   
The distribution of TAF and TFV in pregnant and lactating animals has been evaluated.  In pregnant rats, 
rabbits and monkeys the extent of placental transfer of TAF and TFV was measured during the embryo-fetal 
developmental studies.  In rats there was a clear increase in TFV exposure with increasing dose of TAF 
(Study Nos. TX-120-2001 and TX-120-2002).  Multiple dosing in the dose-range finding study showed signs 
of accumulation of TFV, however this was not seen in the definitive study.   
In rabbits, there was an increase in exposure to TAF and TFV with increasing dose, with no evidence of 
accumulation (Study Nos TX-120-2004 and TX-120-2005).   
In the monkey the extent of placental transfer of TFV following subcutaneous administration was determined 
in pregnant rhesus monkeys (Study No. 96-DDM-1278-005).  Placental transfer of TFV appeared to be 
significant with a foetal/maternal serum concentration ratio of 0.17 ± 0.07 (mean ± SD) at approximately 30 
minutes post-dose. 
FTC/TAF: 
Drug interactions, within the combination, that affect distribution would not be expected from the data 
available. Interactions through binding displacement would not be anticipated.  
Metabolism 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 32/162 
  
  
 
FTC: 
FTC is not subject to significant metabolism by CYP enzymes.  Generation of a minor (~1%) sulfoxide 
metabolite (M1 and/or M2) was catalysed by CYP3A4, and inhibitor studies suggested that at least one other 
enzyme, possibly flavin-containing monooxygenase, may play a role (Study No. 15396 v1).  A minor direct 
glucuronide metabolite, M3, was also detected.   
FTC was not extensively metabolised and is eliminated primarily as unchanged drug by renal excretion in 
mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. Over 90% of the radioactivity in mouse and rat urine and 64% of the 
radioactivity in monkey urine was unchanged drug.  Only trace levels of metabolites were found in faeces 
(Study Nos. TEIN/93/0015, TEIN/93/0016, TOX063). In all 3 species, metabolism accounted for only a minor 
percentage of FTC elimination. FTC is subject to Phase I metabolism (oxidation to a diastereomeric sulfoxide) 
and to some direct conjugation (glucuronidation of hydroxymethyl group) as minor metabolic routes. 
TAF: 
Tenofovir alafenamide is subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further phosphorylated to the 
anabolites, TFV-MP and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the pharmacologically active form.  
The applicant has proposed a possible metabolism pathway based upon the findings from mice, rats, dogs 
and humans (Figure 3). TAF is also subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further 
phosphorylated to the anabolites, tenofovir-monophosphate and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the 
pharmacologically active form. 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016

Figure 3.  Proposed metabolism pathway for TAF 
In vitro Metabolism:  
The potential for CYP enzymes to metabolise TAF was assessed by incubating TAF with 6 individual bacterially 
expressed human CYP enzyme preparations co-expressed with human NADPH CYP reductase (Study No. AD-
120-2004). Metabolism of TAF was not detected by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP 2D6.  
Tenofovir alafenamide was slowly metabolised by CYP3A4 at a rate of 1.9 min-1 which was 26.6% of the 
positive control, testosterone. 
Intracellular metabolic activation of TAF in PBMCs or other lymphatic tissues involves conversion to TFV by 
cathepsin A. In contrast to PBMCs, TAF was primarily hydrolysed by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in primary 
hepatocytes. Tenofovir is then further phosphorylated to TFV-DP by cellular nucleotide kinases.

The in vitro activation of TAF in human primary hepatocytes was evaluated and compared with that of TDF 
and TFV (Study No. AD-120-2017).  Following a 24-hour continuous incubation of primary hepatocytes with 5 
µM TAF, TDF, or TFV, the levels of GS-77938 increased to 1,470, 302, and 12.1 pmol/million cells illustrating 
that incubation with TAF resulted in 5- and 120-fold higher intracellular levels of GS-77938 compared to TDF 
and TFV, respectively. 
The in vitro metabolism of [14C]TFV was studied in dog plasma, in control and induced (Aroclor 1254) rat 
liver microsomes, and also in dog liver and intestinal S9 fractions (Study No. 96-DDM-1278-003).  Tenofovir 
was recovered unchanged under all conditions: no metabolites were detected in either rat microsomal 
preparation, with or without the addition of NADPH cofactor.  There was no evidence of chiral inversion 
either.  
In vivo Metabolism: 
The metabolic profiles of TAF were determined in plasma, urine, faeces, kidney, liver, and nasal turbinate 
from mice (Study No. AD-120-2012); in plasma, urine, bile, and faeces from rats (Study No. AD-120-2021); 
and in plasma, urine, bile, faeces, bone, and liver from dogs (Study No. AD-120-2008). The metabolite 
profiles were also determined in human plasma, urine, and faeces following administration of a single oral 
dose of [14C]TAF (Study No. GS-US-120-0109).  
TFV accounted for a majority of drug related material in plasma, urine, and faeces from all species except for 
human plasma, in which uric acid (M27B) was the predominant metabolite accounting for 73.9% of the total 
AUC over 96 hours.  Uric acid is also detected to a large extent in mouse plasma (19.4%).  M18 was the 
major metabolite in rat bile accounted for 63% of total radioactivity recovered in bile.  M18 and its oxidised 
metabolite, M16 were the major metabolites in dog bile accounted for 29 and 38% of total radioactivity 
recovered in bile.  Various oxidative metabolites were found in dog bile.  No metabolites unique to human 
were observed. 
The extent of TFV transformation to TFV-DP was examined in PBMCs, red blood cells (RBCs) and lymph nodes 
from monkeys (Study No. P2001025).  Animals were administered a single dose of 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg of 
[14C]TFV subcutaneously. TFV was taken up by PBMCs and anabolised to TFV-DP, with intracellular 
concentrations of the active antiviral anabolite reaching 1.6 µM (60 mg/kg dose group). The half-life of TFV-
DP in this experiment was >50 hours. A similar pattern developed in RBCs and lymph nodes. The long 
intracellular half-life in this respect supports the proposed once daily clinical dosing regimen.  
FTC/TAF: 
TAF is a weak substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A.  
FTC and TAF are analogues of different nucleosides, cytidine and adenosine, respectively and so have no 
overlapping metabolism pathways, and in fact in experiments in which both drugs are incubated together at 
doses higher than that expected to be achieved in the clinic, there was no influence on conversion of TFV to 
TFV-DP with the presence of FTC. Conversion of FTC to FTC-triphosphate was also unaffected.  In vitro 
studies also confirm that there exists a synergism between FTC and TAF.

Excretion 
FTC: 
The primary route of elimination of [3H]FTC and [14C]FTC was via renal excretion of parent drug after oral 
and IV administration in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys.  The majority of the FTC recovered in the 
faeces after oral administration most likely represents unabsorbed drug, rather than biliary excretion.  
Although FTC is metabolised to only a minor extent, its metabolites are also excreted via the kidneys. 
Excretion into milk has not been evaluated for FTC. 
TAF/TFV: 
Excretion of oral radiolabelled TAF has been reviewed across mice, rats and dogs.  
Mice were administered a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study No. AD-120-2011).  Recovery of 
radioactivity was 61% from urine and faeces 48 hours post-dose. An average of 41.3 and 27.7% of the 
administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. 
Male bile duct-intact and BDC male SD rats were given a single 5 mg/kg oral dose of 14C]TAF (Study No. AD-
120-2020). [14C]TAF was rapidly excreted within 24 hours after oral dosing. The mean values of 71.9 and 
22.2% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-
dose.  The mean overall recovery of radioactivity was 96.7%.  
Excretion of radiolabelled TFV was examined following IV administration at doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg to SD 
rats. Excretion was 85.2 ± 7.63% at 24 hrs, and 92.7% ± 6.77 % by 7 days post-dose in urine.  Faecal 
elimination was 3.18% ± 1.85% by 24 hours, and 4.48% ± 1.89% by 7 days post-dose. 
In dogs the excretion of [14C]TAF was determined after administration of a single 15-mg/kg oral dose of 
14C-TAF to bile duct-intact and BDC male dogs (Study No. AD-120-2007).  [14C]TAF was readily excreted 
mostly within 48 hours after oral dosing. The mean values of 37.4% and 35.9% of the administered 
radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. Overall mean recovery 
of radioactivity was 80.4%. 
Excretion of radiolabelled TFV was evaluated in dogs following a single IV dose of [14C]TFV (Study No. 96-
DDM-1278-002). The primary route of elimination was via urine, where 70.03% of total radioactivity was 
recovered. Total faecal recovery of radioactivity was 0.42% of the total dose. 
Bile excretion: Bile excretion has been examined in both rat and dog studies following oral administration 
with radiolabelled TAF. 3.2%, and 2.11% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces, urine, 
and bile, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. The mean overall recovery of radioactivity after oral dosing to 
BDC rats was 99.9%. 
The excretion of [14C]TAF was determined following oral administration of a single 15-mg/kg dose of 
[14C]TAF to male dogs (Study No. AD-120-2007). Mean values of 42.7%, 26.5%, and 14.0% of the 
administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces, urine, and bile, respectively, through 168 hours post-
dose.  Based on the radioactivity excreted in urine and bile, a minimum of approximately 41% of the orally 
administered dose was absorbed.  Elimination via biliary excretion appears to be the major route of 
elimination of [14C]TAF in dogs. The overall recovery of radioactivity in BDC dogs was 86.2%.

Excretion to milk: The extent of TFV excretion in lactating monkeys was evaluated. Milk was obtained from 2 
lactating adult female rhesus monkeys following a single 30 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of TFV (Study No. 
P2000116). TFV was detected in the milk, the AUC in milk was between 18.6-21.5% of that seen in plasma.  
FTC/TAF: 
FTC and TFV are almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
FTC: 
FTC was not an inhibitor of activities catalysed by CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A in human 
hepatic microsomal fractions. FTC also did not show inhibition of the glucuronidation of 7-hydroxycoumarin, a 
general UGT substrate. FTC did not activate human AhR or PXR at concentrations up to 50 μM.  In vitro 
studies indicate that FTC is not a substrate or an inhibitor of any of the transporters tested except for being a 
substrate of OAT3 (Tables 3.6.2 and 3.6.3). 
TAF/TFV: 
The potential for TAF to be involved in drug-drug interactions has been assessed in a range of in vitro test 
systems. The potential of TAF or its metabolites to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes and serve as substrates or 
inhibitors of xenobiotic transporters was assessed.  The effect of other drugs, including other antiviral agents 
that may be co-administered with TAF, on intestinal stability and the absorption potential was also 
determined. Considering the data generated using ex vivo human tissue the extent of unbound TAF was 
estimated to be 20% of total exposure.   
Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 enzymes and UGT1A1: 
The potential for TAF and TFV to inhibit human CYP-mediated drug metabolism was examined in vitro using 
hepatic microsomal fractions and enzyme-selective activities (Study Nos. AD-120-2003 and V990172-104).  
Inhibition of the following CYP450 enzymes was evaluated, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A.  TAF at a concentration of 25 µM was shown to weakly inhibit CYP3A with an IC50 
ranging from 7.4 to 7.6 µM.  TFV did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A.   
In Study No. AD-120-2040, the potential for TAF to be a mechanism based inhibitor of human CYP enzymes 
was investigated.  TAF at a concentration of 50 µM had no effect on inhibition to any of the tested 
isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6). Tenofovir alafenamide did not 
inhibit UGT1A1 up to 50 µM (IC50 > 50 µM) (Study No. AD-120-2006). 
Enzymology of Metabolism: 
To examine whether TAF may be metabolised by intestinal esterases and/or CYP enzymes following intestinal 
absorption, the effects of other HIV PIs and CYP inhibitors was explored in Study No. AD-120-2027. TAF was 
incubated with HIV-1 PIs (atazanivir or darunavir) or CYP inhibitors (ritonavir or COBI) at concentration of up 
to 100 µM.  The stability of TAF was unaffected by the presence of these CYP inhibitors or PIs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 37/162 
  
  
In order to investigate which enzymes are involved in activation of TAF in human hepatocytes, TAF was 
incubated alongside known CatA inhibitors (approved hepatitis C virus NS3 inhibitors, telaprevir and 
boceprevir), CES1 inhibitor (bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, BNPP), CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor (COBI), or 
telaprevir and BNPP together (Study No. AD-120-2031).  BNPP inhibited the metabolism of TAF in a dose 
dependent manner.  Formation of the active constituent of TAF, TFV-DP was unaffected on co-incubation with 
telaprevir, boceprevir, or COBI. Combining BNPP and telaprevir resulted in an enhanced level of inhibition.  
From the results of this study it is implied that TAF is primarily hydrolysed by CES1 and CatA.  
Induction Liability: 
The ability of TAF to induce CYP enzymes/activity, P-gp or UGT1A1 was examined using cultured human 
helpatocytes treated with 1, 10, and 100 µM TAF once daily for 3 consecutive days (Study No. AD-120-2032).  
Increases in CYP mRNA levels and increased CYP activity is represented in Table 6. 
Table 6.  Effect of TAF Treatment on CYP mRNA Levels and Activity in Cultured Human Hepatocytes (mean, n 
= 3 donors) 
a The viability of the hepatocytes was affected at this concentration of TAF and therefore caution should be taken when interpreting the corresponding induction 
data. 
b Positive controls 50 μM omeprazole, 1000 μM phenobarbital, and 10 μM rifampin for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A, respectively. 
c Phenacetin, bupropion, and testosterone were used as probe substrates for CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A, respectively. 
There was evidence of cytotoxicity following dosing with 100 µM TAF with reduced CYP activity but increased 
mRNA levels.  After treatment with 10 µM TAF, the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 increased by 3.0- 
and 8.3-fold which correspond to 3% and 6% of control levels.  This demonstrates that TAF has a potential to 
induce CYP isoenzymes at 10 µM but this was reduced to little or no induction potential at 1 µM.  There was 
no evidence of a change in induction potential for P-gp or UGT1A1 mRNA.  
The potential for TAF to induce human drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters through the 
activation of human AhR or human PXR was further evaluated in cell-based systems (Study No. AD-120-
2005). At a concentration of 50 µM TAF was only able to activate PXR at 23% of a positive control, rifampicin.  
This effect reduced to less than 5% with a dose of 15 µM TAF.  Activation of AhR was not observed following 
dosing with 50 µM TAF.  TAF is unlikely to activate either PXR or AhR xenobiotic receptors.  
Potential for Transporter-Mediated Drug Interactions with TAF and TFV: 
The ability of TAF and/TFV to affect to action of drug transporters has been explored in a number of in vitro 
studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016

TAF:  
In terms of inhibiting drug transporters, TAF was unable to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 (Study 
No.s. AD-120-2019 and AD-120-2036). Inhibition to OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, OCT1, and MATE1 was 
observed but only to a small extent, i.e. at doses that were 200-fold in excess to clinical meaningful 
exposures.  TAF is unlikely to mediate the role of transporter-mediated drug interactions. 
In terms of TAF acting as a substrate to drug transporters, TAF has been shown to be a substrate for 
intestinal efflux transporters, P-gp and BCRP. There is an increase in TAF absorption in the presence of 
cyclosporine A (CsA) and COBI (inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP) (Study Nos. AD-120-2037 and AD-120-2013).  
In a study completed in which dogs were orally administered TAF at 2 mg/kg following untreated or 
pretreated animals with 75 mg/kg CsA, there was increased exposure to TAF in the CsA pretreated animals, 
although this had no effect on the overall level of TFV present.  The increased TAF plasma exposure led to an 
increase in levels of TFV-DP detected in PBMCs, suggesting that co-administration of TAF with an efflux 
transport inhibitor (i.e. COBI) would increase absorption and also result in higher levels of the active anti-
viral substance, TFV-DP.  
TAF was found to be a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  Exposure to TAF 
may be affected by inhibitors of these transporters or genetic polymorphisms that affect the transport 
activities.  Unlike TFV, TAF was not a substrate for renal transporters, OAT1 and OAT3. 
TFV:  
The route of elimination of TFV is renal excretion by a combination of glomerular filtration and tubular 
secretion.  In order to understand the role of transporters in the renal secretion of TFV and to explore 
potential drug interactions based on these transport systems, the interactions of TFV with a variety of both 
uptake and efflux transporters were studied in vitro.  
Results of in vitro transport studies indicate that the active tubular secretion of TFV is mediated by human 
OAT1 (basolateral uptake) and MRP4 (apical efflux) transporters acting in series in proximal tubules (Study 
Nos. PC-103-2001, AD-104-2001, AD-104-2002).  Human OAT3 may play a secondary role in the tubular 
uptake of TFV.  Neither P-gp nor MRP2 appear to be involved in the efflux of TFV.   
As the primary transporter handling the uptake of TFV, OAT1 has been assessed for its potential role in drug 
interactions between TFV and other renally secreted therapeutics including antibiotics, anti-inflammatory 
agents, and other antivirals (including PIs).  Under physiologically relevant conditions, none of the tested 
drugs affected OAT1-mediated transport of TFV, indicating a low potential for renal interactions with TFV due 
to inhibition of this pathway (Study No. PC-104-2010 and Study No. PC-104-2011).  
COBI also shows no detectable inhibition of human OAT1 or OAT3.  Similarly, PIs ATV, LPV, and RTV did not 
exhibit any effect on the active cellular elimination of TFV mediated by the MRP4 efflux pump, and COBI is a 
very weak inhibitor of MRP4.  The results of in vitro drug interaction studies indicate that PIs or COBI are 
unlikely to exert any substantial effect on the renal elimination of TFV in general or result in the accumulation 
of TFV in renal proximal tubules.  
The results from in vitro studies investigating the contribution from MRP1 in tubular reabsorption of TFV 
(Study No. PC-104-2014) indicated that MRP1 is not involved in the reabsorption of TFV at the basolateral 
membrane of proximal tubule cells.  
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 39/162 
  
  
TFV did not inhibit the activity of human OCT2 or MATE1 (IC50 >300 μM) so TFV is unlikely to cause drug 
interactions through inhibition of these transporters (Study No. AD-104-2012). 
FTC/TAF: 
In addition to the studies described for the individual component of F/TAF FDC, a number of transporter 
studies were conducted with the STB components, elvitegravir (EVG), cobicistat (COBI), FTC, and TFV. Since 
TFV is the major circulating metabolite for both TDF and TAF, these results are relevant to evaluate the 
potential for transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions among these components.  
Emtricitabine, TAF, and TFV do not inhibit any of the transporters tested at clinically relevant concentrations 
in vitro. Therefore, FTC, TAF, and TFV are unlikely to be a perpetrator of transporter-mediated drug 
interactions. Renal excretion of TFV is facilitated by basolateral uptake by OAT1 and OAT3 and apical efflux 
by the MRP4 efflux transporter. There is no evidence for inhibition of TFV renal excretion by FTC as it shows 
undetectable inhibition of OAT1, OAT3, and MRP4 in vitro. 
As F/TAF FDC may be used in combination with boosted ARVs, the potential for drug-drug interactions with a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer, COBI or ritonavir (RTV), was examined. Neither FTC nor TFV interact with drug 
metabolising enzymes as substrates, inhibitors, or inducers (oxidative metabolism of FTC plays a minor role 
in the elimination of the compound) and so is unlikely to influence metabolic drug interactions with COBI or 
RTV. Cobicistat and RTV were shown to be weak inhibitors of efflux transporters, P-gp and BCRP. Since TAF, 
but not FTC, is a substrate for both P-gp and BCRP, high concentrations of COBI or RTV achieved briefly in 
the intestinal lumen can inhibit the intestinal efflux of TAF, increasing absorption. Therefore, a lower TAF 
dose for the FDC (F/TAF, 200/10 mg) is recommended when used with boosted ARVs. This is adequately 
addressed in the SmPC.  
Cobisistat and RTV showed either weak or undetectable inhibition of OAT1, OAT3, and MRP4 in vitro. 
Transport of TFV by OAT1, OAT, and MRP4 was not meaningfully inhibited by COBI or RTV under 
physiological conditions and clinically relevant concentrations. In addition, COBI and RTV had no effect on the 
accumulation of TFV in human renal tissue slices at clinically relevant concentrations. Since both COBI and 
RTV are inhibitors and TAF is a substrate of OATP transporters in vitro, the exposure to TAF may be affected 
by COBI or RTV via inhibition of hepatic uptake. The effects of differences in OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 activity 
are, however, not expected to be clinically relevant given the high passive permeability of TAF. Due to the 
highly restricted substrate specificity of the enzymes catalyzing the phosphorylation of FTC and TFV, 
inhibition of pharmacological activation by COBI or RTV is unlikely. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated in mouse, rat, dog, and non-human primate repeat-dose toxicity 
studies up to 39 weeks in duration. In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted. Rat fertility and 
developmental toxicity studies were conducted, along with developmental and reproductive toxicity studies 
and a local irritation study in the rabbit. The vehicle for toxicity studies used was 1) 25mM citric acid or 2) 
0.5% polysorbate 20, 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose, 0.9% benzyl alcohol or 3) 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 
0.1% (v/v) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). 
In agreement with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629722/2012; EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/2012/1), no carcinogenicity studies were conducted 
due to the lack of TAF exposure in rats and TgRasH2 mice and lower TFV exposure in rats and mice compared 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 40/162 
  
  
to the same studies in which TDF was administered. No peri/postnatal study was conducted based on 
scientific advice adopted by CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/ 214541/2013; EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/FU/1/2013/1). As 
with the carcinogenicity study rationale, there is an inability to measure plasma concentrations of TAF in rats, 
and TFV exposure after TAF administration was less than that already tested in the TDF peri/postnatal study. 
The absence of nonclinical safety studies with the combination is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on 
the Non-Clinical Development of Fixed Combinations of Medicinal Products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005, 
January 2008). Extensive clinical safety data are available for the approved drugs FTC (Emtriva), TDF 
(Viread), the FTC/TDF FDC product (Truvada), and the E/C/F/TDF FDC product (STB, Stribild) and support 
the overall risk/benefit of this new E/C/F/TAF FDC product. 
In the development of TAF, 3 forms of the active drug substance were used: GS-7340, synonym for GS-7340 
as the free base; GS-7340-02, synonym for GS-7340 as the monofumarate (1:1 molar ratio of free base to 
fumaric acid), and GS-7340-03, synonym for the hemifumarate (2:1 molar ratio of free base to fumaric acid). 
The hemifumarate, GS-7340-03 (TAF fumarate) is the selected for final development. It is stated that GS-
7340-03 is considered comparable to GS-7340-02 based on physical/chemical properties and both exist as 
the free base in blood and biological fluids.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies used GS-7340-02 however the applicant states that any potential effects of the 
hemifumarate have been evaluated by studies of the monofumarate. The hemifumarate, GS-7340-03 was 
used in the male and female fertility study, dermal and ocular irritation studies, the local lymph node assay, 
and a second impurity qualification study.  
Single dose toxicity 
In male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (5/sex/group) given an oral dose (15 mL/kg) of TAF at 100, 300, or 
1000 mg/kg (80, 240, 800 mg/kg free base equivalents [f.b.e.]/kg) followed by a 14-day observation period 
(study number: R990185) the NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg. 
Male and female beagle dogs (1/sex/group) were given a single oral dose (15 mL/kg) of 30, 90, or 270 
mg/kg (24, 72, 216 mg f.b.e./kg) TAF followed by a 14-day observation period (Study number: D990181). 
In-life observations of salivation, vomiting, reduced activity, tremors, incoordination seen at 270 mg/kg 
which resolved 2 days following dosing. There was an increase in blood urea nitrogen at 270 mg/kg (present 
on study Day 2, not study Day 14. Thymus weights were at all doses compared with controls, and thymic 
atrophy was present in males at 90 and 270 mg/kg. Renal tubular changes characterised by basophilia 
and/or karyomegaly were present in the male at 270 mg/kg and females at 270 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg. The 
NOAEL as considered to be 30 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Mouse 
A two week mouse study was conducted; however the results were not interpretable due to a large number 
of confirmed gavage errors and the viscosity of the formulation. These data will not be discussed in this 
report.

13-Week GLP Oral Mouse Toxicity Study (study number TX-120-2007) 
Crl:CD1(ICR) mice (15/sex/group) were given 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day (8, 24, 80 mg f.b.e./kg/day). The 
vehicle used was 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.1% (v/v) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). Reduced body 
weight gain was seen at 100 mg/kg/day in males and at all doses in females. Reduced food consumption was 
noted at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day. In the nasal turbinates an increased incidence and severity of  minimal to 
slight infiltrates of neutrophils in respiratory and olfactory mucosa, and minimal to moderate (100 mg/kg/day 
only) degeneration of olfactory epithelium was seen in both sexes at all doses. In addition adverse findings 
were noted in the nasal turbinates (exudate in the lumen) of both sexes at 30 mg/kg/day and 100 
mg/kg/day. Minimal infiltrates and minimal olfactory degeneration were observed at a lower incidence in 
control animals. Minimal increased apoptosis of the rectum was seen in males and females at 100 
mg/kg/day. No NOAEL could be determined. Due to limited concentration data for TAF, AUC values could not 
be calculated. At week 13, the TFV AUCtau (combined sexes) was 0.213 μgh/mL at 10 mg/kg/day.

Rat 
4-Week Oral Rat Toxicity Study (Study number R990182) 
Daily oral administration of GS-7340-02 (15 mL/kg) at 1.5, 6.25, 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (1.2, 5, 20, 
80, 320 mg free base equivalents (f.b.e.)/kg/day) to SD rats (10/sex/group) for 28 days resulted in 
decreased body weight gain, reduced food consumption, decreases in white blood cell (WBC) and RBC 
parameters, calciuria, decreased bone mineral density (BMD), decreased 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3, renal 
karyomegaly, thymic atrophy, and atrophy of cancellous bone of the femur. Most effects were seen at 400-
mg/kg/day group; however, some changes were noted at 25 mg/kg/day with a non-significant decrease in 
1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 observed at 6.25 mg/kg/day. Based on changes in WBCs, the NOAEL was 
considered to be 6.25 mg/kg/day (no change in WBC count was observed at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day in 
the subsequent 26-week rat toxicity study). 
26-Week Oral Rat Toxicity Study (TOX-120-001).  
Daily oral administration of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 5, 25, and 100 mg/kg/day (4, 20, 80 mg f.b.e./kg/day) to 
SD rats (15/sex/group) for 26 weeks resulted in minimal renal cortical tubular karyomegaly (100 mg/kg/day) 
and minimal to slight tibial cancellous bone atrophy (females, 100 mg/kg/day), changes in bone density 
measurements (100 mg/kg/day) and changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover (25 and 100 
mg/kg/day) were also noted. These effects were not observed at 5 mg/kg/day. TAF (GS-7340-02) dose-
dependently increase biochemical markers of bone turnover in males and dose-independently decrease 
serum 1,25-dihydroxy- and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in both sexes at 25 and 100 mg/kg/day. It is stated that 
as the effects (increases in biochemical markers of bone turnover and changes in related hormones) seen at 
25 mg/kg/day were minimal, it was concluded that the NOAEL was 25 mg/kg/day.

Toxicokinetic analysis of plasma samples showed that TAF was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing and was 
rapidly converted to TFV. No consistent differences in plasma pharmacokinetics were found between the 
sexes. Tenofovir was eliminated from the plasma with half-lives ranging from 7 to 13 hours. Mean TFV Cmax 
and AUC values for combined sex groups increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 5 mg/kg/day 
to 100 mg/kg/day at each study period.

Rabbits 
Daily oral administration of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 20, 50 and 75 mg/kg/day to female rabbits, for 7 days, was 
generally well tolerated (Study number TX-120-2003). Plasma exposure to TAF and TFV generally increased 
with increase in dose level from 20 to 75 mg/kg/day. Values for mean Cmax and AUC0-t of TFV were 
generally higher on Day 7 than on Day 1. TAF was rapidly and extensively converted to TFV. The mean TAF 
AUC0-t on day 7 was unable to be calculated at 20 mg/kg/day (due to values below the lower limit of 
quantitation of 1.00 ng/mL) and was 0.252 and 1.174 μg·hr/mL at 50 and 75 mg/kg/day, respectively. The 
mean TFV AUC0-t on day 7 was 2.256, 5.741 and 10.070 μg·hr/mL at 20, 50, and 75 mg/kg/day, 
respectively. 
Dog 
4-Week Oral Toxicity Study (Study number : D990175) 
Daily oral administration of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.08, 0.24, 0.8, 2.4, 8 mg 
f.b.e./kg/day) (Study number D990175) to male and female beagle dogs (4/sex/group) for 28 days resulted 
in increased AST in females at 10 mg/kg/day and renal tubular karyomegaly and/or basophilia in both sexes 
at 10 mg/kg/day and 1 male and 1 female at 3 mg/kg/day. Mean values for bone specific alkaline 
phosphatase, N telopeptide, parathyroid hormone, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D and 25 hydroxyvitamin D were 
generally similar across all groups. There were no effects on peripheral quantitative computed tomography-
derived bone densitometry parameters (eg, bone mineral content and bone mineral density of the total slice 
and trabecular and cortical/subcortical compartments). The NOAEL was considered to be 1 mg/kg/day. 
At the lower doses, only Cmax and Tmax values for TAF were determined as most values were below the 
lower limit of quantitation of the assay. TAF was rapidly absorbed on Day 1, with median peak values within 
0.25 to 0.5 hours of 18.5, 38.7, and 0.582 μg/mL at 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. Peak TFV 
concentrations occurred within 1 hour. At 10 mg/kg/day, Day 28 TFV Cmax and AUCtau were 0.44 μg/mL 
and 5.26 μgµh/mL, respectively (males and females combined). Comparisons between Day 1 and Day 28 at 
10 mg/kg/day showed potential accumulation upon repeat dosing. Tenofovir in PBMCs was measurable (18.6 
μg/mL) after 28 days of 10 mg/kg/day TAF.

39-Week Oral Toxicity Study with a 3 month recovery period (Study number: TOX-120-002). 
Male and female beagle dogs were administered daily oral doses (10 mL/kg) of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 2, 6, or 
18/12 mg/kg/day (1.6, 4.8, 14.4/9.6 mg f.b.e./kg/day) for 13 weeks (2/sex/group) or 39 weeks 
(4/sex/group). A dose-related decrease in body weight gain at 39 weeks was seen in all males at all doses 
and for females at18/12 mg/kg/day. The dose for the high dose group was reduced from 18 to 12 mg/kg/day 
on Days 45 and 51, for males and females, respectively, due to the occurrence of severe clinical signs and 
reduced body weight.  
There were 2 unscheduled deaths (2x males at 18 mg/kg). One of these was considered to be due to a 
gavage accident. A different male at 18 mg/kg was killed on Day 45 due to deteriorating clinical condition, 
which was considered to be treatment related. Prior to necropsy this animal had shown reduced body weight; 
reduced food consumption; increased AST, globulin levels, triglyceride, cholesterol, total bilirubin; and 
decreased monocyte and platelet counts. Macroscopically, there was bilateral enlargement of the 
submandibular lymph nodes, which histologically had slight inflammation and plasmacytosis. Histopathology 
consisted of mild, mononuclear infiltrate in the ocular posterior uvea; renal cortical tubular degeneration; 
atrophy of GALT, mesenteric lymph node, and thymus accompanied by an infiltrate of macrophages; mucosal 
atrophy of the fundic gland; mucosal hyperplasia of the pyloric gland; and mucosal degeneration and/or 
regeneration in the cecum and colon. 
Increased mean AST (~2.6x compared to control) and total bilirubin (~1.6x compared to control) in dogs 
administered 18/12 mg/kg/day. No ECG changes occurred at 2 mg/kg/day. At Week 39, a dose-related 
prolongation of PR interval was observed at 6 (~ +13%) and 18/12-mg/kg/day (~ +24%) groups. TAF 
reduce heart rate with an associated QT interval prolongation was seen at 18/12 mg/kg/day. According to the 
Applicant these changes were associated with decreases in serum triiodothyronine (T3).  After the 13-week 
recovery period, serum T3 values returned to levels similar to the controls.  
Table 10.  Electrocardiograph findings 
The applicant states that all bone markers showed age-related decreases. After 3 months, there were some 
differences noted among mean values for bone formation (skeletal alkaline phosphatase [sALP]) and bone

resorption markers (urinary free deoxypyridinoline and N telopeptide) at all doses compared to controls. After 
9 months, statistically significant increases in mean values for the bone resorption marker urinary N 
telopeptide were noted for both sexes at 18/12 mg/kg/day (p ≤0.05), compared to controls. A similar though 
not statistically significant trend was noted in animals at 6 mg/kg/day, suggesting a dose-related response. 
No significant changes in free deoxypyridinoline were observed, with no consistent effects (increases) among 
treated groups. For the formation marker, serum sALP values at all doses were comparable controls except 
for one male at 18/12 mg/kg/day, which was outside the control ranges (no further details are provided in 
the non-clinical toxicology summary). At the end of the recovery period, bone marker values returned to 
below the control range consistent with an age effect and recovery from treatment. 
At 18/12 mg/kg/day administered once daily to young beagle dogs for 39 weeks resulted in changes in bone 
densitometry parameters (by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] analysis) considered to reflect 
primarily effects on bone growth. These changes were considered by the Applicant as secondary to the 
effects on body weight. 
Histopathology changes were noted in the kidneys, eyes, lungs, and spleen after both 13 and 39 weeks. The 
liver and possibly the adrenal glands were additional target organs identified after 39 weeks. After 13-weeks 
of treatment, findings of renal cortical tubular degeneration/regeneration and karyomegaly were seen at 6 or 
18/12 mg/kg/day; findings after 39 weeks of treatment were similar. These changes were minimal to slight 
(Grade 1 to 2) at 6 mg/kg/day in both sexes. At 18/12 mg/kg/day severity ranged from mild to moderate 
(Grade 2 to 3). After 39-weeks of treatment, similar lesions (minimal (Grade 1) karyomegaly and tubular 
degeneration) was seen in 2 males at 2 mg/kg/day.  
A minimal to slight (Grade 1 to 2) infiltration of mononuclear cells in the ocular posterior uvea was noted in 
some animals at 18/12 mg/kg/day after both treatment periods. Alveolar histiocytosis was present in the 
lungs after 13-weeks at 18/12 mg/kg/day. Additional pulmonary findings noted following 39-weeks of 
treatment and consisted of macrophage accumulation with pigment, which was detected predominantly 
at18/12 mg/kg/day and in few animals at 6- or 2-mg/kg/day. An infiltration of macrophages laden with 
pigment was very frequently seen in the splenic white pulp at 18/12 mg/kg/day after both treatment periods. 
After 39 weeks of treatment centrilobular hepatocellular cytoplasmic acidophilic inclusions were seen at 18/12 
mg/kg/day, pigment deposits in hepatic macrophages and/or sinusoidal cells (Kupffer cells) was seen at 
18/12 mg/kg/day. Also, similar pigment deposits in the sinusoidal cells (tissue macrophages) of the adrenal 
glands were seen in a few animals at 18/12 mg/kg/day. The Applicant goes onto sat that the cause of the 
intracellular pigment in tissue macrophages in the lung, liver, spleen, and adrenal is not known but could 
represent accumulation of the test article and/or test article metabolite(s) in these cells of the mononuclear 
phagocyte system. After the 13-week recovery period test article-related histological changes were still 
present in the kidneys, lungs, and liver however were reduced in incidence and severity. 
At 18/12 mg/kg/day, a minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in some organs (eye [choroid plexus, 
ciliary body], lung, and spleen) in some animals. In-life ophthalmologic examinations were normal. 
The NOAEL after 39 weeks of treatment was considered to be 2 mg/kg/day. Treatment-related findings were 
completely or partially reversible following a 13-week recovery period. 
Toxicokinetic analysis showed that TAF was rapidly absorbed and converted to TFV following oral dose 
administration, with peak plasma concentrations of TAF and TFV occurring 0.5 and 1 hour after dosing, 
respectively. The systemic exposure of TAF was dose dependent. Plasma Cmax and AUC values for GS-7340 
increased more than proportionally over the dose range. Plasma Cmax and AUC, increased roughly in 
Assessment report

proportion to the administered dose. There was some accumulation of TFV following repeat dosing 
(approximately 3-fold). There was no sex difference. 
Tenofovir concentrations in PBMCs were measurable at 24 hours after dosing at all doses. The median 
terminal phase half-life of total TFV in PBMCs was estimated to be 31 hours (similar to the TFV plasma 
estimate) from the recovery animals with PBMC concentrations measured up to 72 hours. Dose-normalised 
PBMC mean AUC values of total TFV increased more than dose proportionally during Week 39/40.

Non-human primate  
4-Week Oral Rhesus Monkey Toxicity Study (Study number P2000114) 
Animals were given TAF (GS-7340-02) at 3 or 30 mg/kg/day (2.4, 24 mg f.b.e./kg/day) or TFV at 15 
mg/kg/day. According to the company there were no adverse in-life effects and no clear test article-related 
effects on body weight, serum chemistry, plasma chemistry, haematology (including lymphocyte subsets 
determined by flow cytometry), standard urinalysis parameters, organ weights, and bone-related or 
histologic parameters. There was 1 death at 30-mg/kg/day TAF, which was not considered test article-related 
(no further details are provided on the toxicology summary). Kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle samples 
assayed for indicators of mitochondrial integrity showed no effects. The NOAEL for TAF was considered to be 
30 mg/kg/day.  
The TAF Cmax values were nonlinear with dose, with greater than expected increases in Cmax with dose. The 
TAF AUCtau could only be calculated at 30-mg/kg/day group, with a mean value of 1.03 µg·h/mL and a 
terminal elimination half-life of 0.335 hours. There was no sex difference. 
Table 12.  Mean Pharmacokinetics vales for TAF  
Day 28 TFV Cmax and AUC exhibited slightly greater than proportional increases with increasing dose. 
Comparison between Days 1 and 28 showed no statistical difference for Cmax or AUC indicating no change in 
clearance over time. There was no sex difference.

Carcinogenicity 
Based on the CHMP scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629722/2012; EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/2012/1), 
carcinogenicity studies are not required for TAF registration based on the lack of TAF exposure in rats and 
TgRasH2 mice and lower TFV exposure in rats and mice compared to TDF. 
Reproduction Toxicity and Toxicokinetic data 
Oral Fertility and General Reproduction Toxicity Study of TAF in Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study 
number TX-120-2012).  
Male and female Crl:CD(SD) rats 20, 80, or 160 mg free base equivalent (f.b.e.)/kg/day (22, 90, 180 mg GS-
7340-03/kg/day) TFV (GS-7340-03). Males were necropsied after at least 10 weeks of dosing, the 
reproductive organs were weighed followed by assessment of sperm motility and total concentration. Male 
and female reproductive performance was evaluated based on results of confirmation of mating and 
pregnancy. There were some effects on male body weight at 80 and 160 mg/kg/day and female at 160 
mg/kg/day throughout the study.  
There were no differences in premating estrous cycles. There were no test article-related differences in male 
or female reproductive parameters. There were no test article-related effects on the uterine and foetal 
parameters and no significant differences in female reproductive organ weights. There was a slight increase 
in absolute testis weight (significant increase (9%) in the adjusted mean of the left testis only) at 160 
mg/kg/day. This was considered by the Applicant to be test article-related but not adverse, as there were no 
other reproductive organ weight or functional reproductive effects. There were no test article-related effects 
observed on mean epididymal sperm motility or on sperm concentration. The NOAEL for male and female 
toxicity was 80 mg/kg/day. The TAF NOAEL for reproductive and early embryonic toxicity was 160 
mg/kg/day.

Oral Embryo-Foetal Development Study of TAF in Rats (Study number: TX-120-2002) 
Four groups of 25 pregnant female Crl:CD(SD) rats were given daily doses of TAF (GS-7340-02), by oral 
gavage, from GD 6 to 17, inclusive. Targeted dose levels were 0 (vehicle control), 25, 100 and 250 
mg/kg/day. Dose formulation analysis showed that each 5 mg/kg/day animal was administered a GS-7340-
02 concentration of 3.85 mg/mL instead of 5 mg/mL for 5 to 8 days between GD 10 and 17, providing a daily 
dose of 19.3 mg/kg/day (77% of targeted dose) on these days. Dose formulation analysis showed that each 
20 mg/kg/day animal was administered a GS-7340-02 concentration of 12.9 mg/mL instead of 20 mg/mL for 
4 to 7 days between GD 6 and 12, providing a daily dose of 64.6 mg/kg/day (65% of targeted dose) on these 
days. 
At 250 mg/kg/day a statistically significant decrease in the number of animals noted with incomplete 
ossification of the interparietal and hyoid bones was noted at 250 mg/kg/day. Other minor skeletal anomalies 
were comparable in incidence to controls. At this dose group body weights, body weight gains and food 
consumption were significantly decreased during the treatment period. On GD 21, the mean body weight of 
the 250 mg/kg/day group was 10 % lower than that of the controls. Mean corrected body weights (body 
weight on GD 21 minus gravid uterus weight) and mean corrected body weight gains (body weight gain on 
GD 6 to 21 minus gravid uterus weight) were also lower at 250 mg/kg/day, with the corrected mean body 
weights also 10% lower than controls on GD 21. Foetal weights (males, females and sexes combined) were 
decreased dose dependently and remained within the range of historical control data, however foetal weights 
at 250 mg/kg/day were at the lower extreme of this range. The incidences of foetal major malformations, 
minor external, visceral and skeletal anomalies and were not affected by TAF. Sternebrae variants (1 to 4 
and 5 and 6) were increased at 250 mg/kg/day.  
In summary, at 250 mg/kg/day, there was decreased foetal body weight associated with some delays in the 
rate of ossification. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity attributed to TAF in this study. 
The maternal TAF NOAEL and the TAF NOAEL for embryo-foetal development were both considered to be 100 
mg/kg/day, which resulted in GD17 AUC0-t values of 17.4 and 0.2 μg·hr/mL for TFV and TAF, respectively. 
Plasma concentrations of TAF were all below the lower limit of quantitation at 25 mg/kg/day. Exposure to TAF 
increased with the increasing dose from 25 to 250 mg/kg/day. Exposure to TFV increased with the increase in 
TAF dose from 25 to 250 mg/kg/day.  
Oral Embryo-Foetal Development Study of TAF in Rabbits (TX-120-2005) 
TAF (GS-7430-02) was administered by oral gavage to time-mated F0 generation female rabbits (20 main 
study females per group and 3 toxicokinetic females per group) at 0 (vehicle control), 10, 30 and 100 
mg/kg/day. Lower body weight gains were noted at 100 mg/kg/day for the first week following treatment 
initiation. Lower food intake was noted at 100 mg/kg/day from GD 8 to 24. Three animals at this dose 
consumed less than 30 g for at least 4 days during the dosing period. There were no TAF-related macroscopic 
changes. The number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live foetuses, dead foetuses, resorptions, the sex 
ratio and the pre and post implantation losses were not affected. There was no effect of TAF on foetal 
weights. The incidence of major malformations, minor external, visceral, skeletal anomalies and common 
skeletal variants were not affected by TAF. 
Exposure to TAF increased increasing dose (10 to 100 mg/kg/day). The increases in Cmax were greater than 
proportional between 10 to 100 mg/kg/day and the increases in AUC0-t were greater than proportional 
between 30 to 100 mg/kg/day on GD 20. Exposure to TFV increased with increasing   TAF doses from 10 to 
100 mg/kg/day. The increases in Cmax and AUC0-t were roughly proportional between the 10 to 100 
mg/kg/day. Accumulation of TFV was observed after multiple dosing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 48/162 
  
  
Concentrations of TFV were higher than concentrations of TAF, indicating that TAF was extensively converted 
to TFV. The TAF NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day (AUC0-t = 1.1 and 5.0 μg·h/mL for TAF and 
TFV, respectively) and the TAF NOEL for embryo-foetal development was 100 mg/kg/day (AUC0-t = 11.0 and 
27.3 μg·h/mL for TAF and TFV, respectively.  
Local Tolerance  
In a bovine corneal opacity and permeability assay (BCOP) TAF (GS-7340-03) elicited an in vitro irritancy 
score of 21.0 ± 8.7 with a 4-hour incubation and was predicted to be a noncorrosive/non-severe eye irritant. 
In a dermal irritation study in rabbits animals were given a single 4 hour, semi-occlusive, dermal 
administration of approximately 0.5 g of TAF (GS-7340-03 and were observed for 4 days (Study number: TX-
120-2011). No local dermal reaction was observed in any animal throughout the duration of the study. The 
Primary Irritation Index was calculated to be 0.0; TAF was classified as a ‘non-irritant’. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Female mice were given TAF (GS-7340-03) at of 10, 25 or 50% w/v. The animals were administered TAF by 
daily application of 25 μL of the appropriate concentration or control (vehicle or positive), to the dorsal 
surface of both ears for 3 consecutive days. The proliferative response of the lymph node cells (LNCs) from 
the draining auricular lymph nodes was assessed 5 days following the initial application, by measurement of 
the incorporation of 3H-methyl thymidine (3HTdR) by β-scintillation counting of LNC suspensions.  
The response was expressed as radioactive disintegrations per minute per lymph node (dpm/node) and as 
the ratio of 3HTdR incorporation into LNC of test nodes relative to that recorded for control nodes 
(test/control ratio), termed as SI. The test substance is regarded as a 
sensitizer if at least one concentration of the chemical has a SI of 3 or more. The SI obtained for 10%, 25%, 
and 50% w/v were 0.9, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively, which indicates that TAF did not show the potential to 
induce skin sensitisation. The EC3 value (the “estimated concentration of 3” is the concentration of test 
substance which would result in a SI of 3 in the LLNA) was determined to be higher than 50% w/v. The SI for 
the positive control substance hexyl cinnamic aldehyde was 6.3, which demonstrates the validity of this 
study. 
Studies on impurities 
FTC 
FTC in combination with 1% (by weight) TP-0296 (FTU, degradant), was tested in the Bacterial Reverse 
Mutation Assay to qualify degradant TP-0296 using Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA 100, TA 
1535, and TA 1537 and Escherichia coli tester strain WP2uvrA in the presence and absence of S9 metabolic 
activation. In the initial toxicity-mutation assay, dose levels of FTC tested were 1.5, 5.0, 15, 50, 150, 500, 
1500, and 5000 µg/plate, and the highest dose of TP-0296 tested was 50 µg/plate. No toxicity and no 
Assessment report

Page 49/162 
  
  
positive mutagenic response were observed at any dose. Based on these findings, the maximum doses plated 
in the confirmatory mutagenicity assay were 5000 µg/plate for FTC and 50 µg/plate for TP-0296. 
In the confirmatory mutagenicity assay, no positive mutagenic response was observed (FTC tested were 50, 
150, 500, 1500, and 5000 µg/plate.  
The chromosome aberration assay was used to evaluate the clastogenic potential of the combination of FTC 
and 1% TP-0296 (FTU, degradant). This GLP-compliant study of FTC was conducted to qualify TP-0296 using 
Chinese Hamster ovary (CHO) cells in the absence and presence of S9 metabolic activation. The percentage 
of cells with structural or numerical aberrations in the FTC/TP-0296 groups was not significantly increased 
above that of the solvent control at any dose level (p>0.056, Fisher’s exact test). Based on the results of this 
study, it was concluded that FTC with 1% TP-0296 was negative for the induction of structural and numerical 
chromosome aberrations in CHO cells.  
There was no toxicity in a 28-day mouse study at doses (FTC/FTU) of 50/1 mg/kg/day, 150/3 mg/kg/day, 
and450/9 mg/kg/day. A 28-day mouse bridging study was performed to qualify impurities in FTC (specifically 
FTC-carboxylic acid - menthol Process). There was no toxicity of FTC at doses of 50, 150, and 450 
mg/kg/day.  
Based on the impurity profiles, the multiple GLP batches of FTC tested in the toxicology program are 
considered, in composite, to be representative of the GMP material and support the specified limits of 
impurities and degradation products proposed for commercial production. This is considered acceptable. 
TAF 
A 2 week oral rat (males) study was conducted to evaluate the toxicity and to qualify potential impurities of 
TAF. Animals were given GS-7340-02 at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (10 mL/kg) from 2 different purity lots (Lot No. 1 
- 97.7% and Lot No. 2 - 83.1% )]. The impurities, including 13% GS-7339, were added to the more pure lot. 
No test article-related findings were noted, and no differences were found between the 2 lots tested.  
A 4 week oral rat (males and females) study was conducted. Three lots of GS-7340-03 were each 
administered at 25 and 50 mg/kg/day (free base equivalents). Test article 1 was 99.3% pure GS-7340-03. 
Test article 2 was 98% pure GS-7340-03 containing 11 spiked impurities. Test article 3 was 97.8% pure GS-
7340-03 containing 4 spiked impurities. There were no significant in-life or histopathological differences 
between the 3 lots tested. The NOAEL for all 3 lots is 50 mg f.b.e./kg/day. 
Based on their impurity profiles, the multiple GLP batches of TAF tested in the toxicology program are 
considered, in composite, to be representative of the GMP material and support the specified limits of 
impurities and degradation products proposed for commercial production. This is considered acceptable. 
FTC/TDF 
Four degradation products not present in the individual drug substances have been observed in FTC/TDF 
tablets placed on accelerated stability at high temperature. The name for these degradation products are 
mono-POC PMPA/FTC Adduct (Adduct 1), bis-POC PMPA/FTC Adduct (Adduct 2), cyclic FTU1 (cFTU1) and 
cyclic FTU2 (cFTU2). The adducts of FTC/TDF form when formaldehyde, formed by the hydrolysis of TDF (bis-
POC PMPA), reacts with one molecule of each TDF and FTC to form an adduct. FTC may undergo hydrolytic 
deamination and may additionally cyclize via an intramolecular Michael addition of the hydroxyl group of the 
sugar moiety onto the double bond of the uracil ring, thereby creating cyclic-FTU (cFTU; cyclic 5-fluro-1-(2-

hydroxymethyl-[1,3]oxathiolan-5-yl)-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione). While cyclic-FTU has the potential to exist as 
4 diastereomers, only 2 of these diastereomers have been observed in FTC/TDF containing products. The 2 
observed diastereomers of cyclic-FTU are GS-9237 (cyclic-FTU1, cFTU1) and GS-492127 (cyclic-FTU2, 
cFTU2). 
Two 14-day GLP oral toxicity studies were conducted in rats to qualify impurities and degradants in the 
FTC/TDF tablets (TX-164-2001 & TX-164-2005). In the first study, animals were given 20/30, 67/100, or 
200/300 mg/kg/day of non-degraded or degraded FTC/TDF in suspension vehicle. Organ weight evaluation 
showed marginal increases in the weights of adrenal glands (noted in all treated groups except those 
receiving degraded FTC/TDF at 20/30). No gross or histological changes were seen which might account for 
this increased adrenal weight. No treatment-related gross changes were observed. Microscopic evaluation 
revealed hyperplasia of the anterior duodenal mucosa overlying Brunner’s glands. It was seen in 7/10 
animals treated at 200/300 with non-degraded FTC/TDF and in 2/10 animals given degraded FTC/TDF and 
was considered to be treatment-related. The NOAEL was considered to be 67/100 mg/kg/day FTC/TDF.  
The second qualification study (TX-164-2005) was conducted to verify the qualification of cFTU1 and cFTU2 
as these degradants were identified later in development due to a new analytical assay. In these studies, rats 
were given formulations prepared from crushed tablets that were experimentally degraded by humidity and 
high temperatures or formulations prepared from crushed tablets that were not degraded. The doses were 
0/0, 20/30, 67/100, and 200/300 mg/kg/day FTC/TDF in both studies.  
Administration of non-degraded or degraded FTC/TDF at 200/300 mg/kg/day was associated with minimal, 
non-adverse, decreases in red cell mass parameters (Hb and HCT). These changes were associated with 
minimal, non-adverse, red cell indices (MCV, MCH and RDW) changes indicating microcytosis. Findings 
observed in animals administered non-degraded FTC/TDF or degraded FTC/TDF regarding red cell mass 
parameters or indices were considered to be of comparable magnitude and had no microscopic correlates. 
Non-adverse, minimal, dose dependent increases in ALT activity were observed in animals given non-
degraded FTC/TDF at ≥ 67/100 mg/kg/day and degraded FTC/TDF at 200/300 mg/kg/day. Increased ALT 
activity was not associated with histological findings. In the duodenum, there was minimal cryptal epithelium 
hyperplasia and minimal single cell necrosis with both degraded and non-degraded formulations of FTC/TDF 
at 200/300 mg/kg/day. 
The NOAEL was considered to be 200/300 mg/kg/day for both non-degraded and degraded TDF/FTC. No 
differences in toxicity were observed between non-degraded and degraded material. 
There were slight differences in the findings from both studies, however there were no new toxicities or 
exacerbation of previously defined toxicities, and there was no difference in toxicity between non-degraded 
and degraded material. The NOAEL in the initial study (TX-164-2001) was considered to be 67/100 
mg/kg/day, and 200/300 mg/kg/day FTC/TDF in the second study (TX-164-2005). 
The impurities and degradation products present in FTC and TAF and in FTC/TAF tablets have been qualified 
through toxicology studies which employed drug substance from normal productions batches, laboratory 
scale batches with enhanced levels of impurities, or samples subjected to forced degradation conditions (high 
heat and humidity). This is considered acceptable. 
Other studies 
Three relevant non-GLP rat studies and one GLP dog study were conducted to evaluate the potential for TAF 
to alter bone metabolism.

Male rats were given 400 mg/kg TAF (GS-7430-02) by oral gavage daily for 6 days. One animal was due to 
non-drug related injury (study number: R990177). There were no effects on serum parathyroid hormone 
(PTH) concentrations. Serum 1,25-dihydroxycholcalciferol was decreased by 80% compared to controls. 
Urinary deoxypyridinoline (Dpd) was decreased by 38% compared controls. The urinary calcium/creatinine 
and phosphorus/creatinine ratios were increased 444% and 202%, respectively, compared to controls by Day 
6. The results of this study demonstrated that TAF had effects on selected urinary and serum parameters. 
The applicant states that due to the lack of strong statistical comparison to controls and lack of correlation 
between data, interpretation on overall toxicity was not possible.  
In the second study, an additional dose was evaluated. This study examined changes in markers of calcium 
homeostasis in male Sprague-Dawley rats after once daily oral administration of TAF. Animals were given 
100 or 400 mg/kg TAF (GS-7340-02) by oral gavage on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. At 400 mg/kg/day 
statistically significant decreases in body weight gain was noted. No changes in plasma calcium, phosphorus, 
or ionized calcium were observed during the first day of the study at either dose. No changes in serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D3, parathyroid hormone, or total carbon dioxide (CO2) were observed at either dose. 
Significant dose-dependent reductions of 35% and 46% were observed in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on Day 
6 at 100 or 400 mg/kg/day TAF, respectively. Significant non-dose-dependent reductions of 15% and 14% 
were observed in serum calcium on Day 6 at 100 or 400 mg/kg/day TAF, respectively. Significant dose-
dependent decreases of 20% and 31% in serum phosphate were observed at 100 or 400 mg/kg/day TAF, 
respectively. Urinary calcium:creatinine ratio values were significantly decreased by approximately 71% and 
53% on Days 1 and 2, respectively, in at 100 mg/kg/day TAF. Urinarycalcium:creatinine ratio values were 
significantly decreased by 42% (Day 1) then significantly increased by 213% (Day 6) at 400 mg/kg/day TAF. 
No changes in urinary phosphorus:creatinine ratio, N-acetyl-ß-glucosaminidase (NAG):creatinine, cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP):creatinine, pH, protein, urobilinogen, or specific gravity were observed. 
These data indicated that daily administration of TAF to rats for 6 days altered plasma vitamin D, calcium and 
phosphate levels as well as urinary excretion of calcium. It is stated that the mechanistic basis of these 
changes and their biological relationships in terms of cause and effect are unknown. 
Dogs were given oral doses of 37.5 or 75 mg/kg/day of TAF (GS-7340-02) for 5 days (1/dose). Emesis, 
excessive salivation and diarrhoea were observed along with weight loss and reduced food intake. On day 6, 
dogs had decreased WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil counts with a left shift in the 
myeloid series with under representation of mature segmented neutrophils as the predominant bone marrow 
finding. Animals also had increased total protein, globulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, AST, ALP, and creatinine 
kinase (CK) values. A trend toward proteinuria was observed in the urinalysis data. 
The Applicant states that there were no biologically important changes observed in mean values for ionized 
calcium or N telopeptide. The applicant states that the lack of the expected age-related reduction in mean 
serum bone ALP (B-ALP) suggested increased bone remodelling. The mean serum calcitriol (1, 25 
dihydroxycholecalciferol) concentration was reduced by approximate 68% at both doses. The mean serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 hydroxycholecalciferol) concentration was reduced approximately 35% and 33% at 
37.5 and 75 mg/kg/day. Gastrointestinal lesions characterised by epithelial cell necrosis, regenerative 
hyperplasia, and cyst formation were most prevalent in animals at  75 mg/kg/day. Lymphoid cell depletion 
was noted in the lymph nodes, thymus and tonsilat 75 mg/kg/day animals. Bile duct hyperplasia and peri-
portal inflammation was observed at both doses.

Renal Function 
An investigative study was conducted in SD rats to evaluate renal parameters.  Animals were given a single 
oral dose of 100 or 1000 mg/kg/day TAF (GS-7340-02). Urinary output of calcium was increased at 1000 
mg/kg/day which correlated with an increase in serum calcium concentration and indicated that the kidneys 
were functioning in order to reduce the serum calcium load.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment (ERA) of Descovy consists of a full assessment for the active substance 
tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in the overall assessment for the FDC. The ERA data from the Genvoya MAA 
(EMEA/H/C/004042) has been used for the assessment of the active substance emtricitabine (FTC). 
Emtricitabine 
The n-octanol/water partition coefficient (Logkow) of FTC was determined to be below 4.5, the Phase I action 
limit for a PBT assessment. 
The predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECsw) was calculated using a refined Fpen 
based on the prevalence of HIV in the member states and the value obtained was above the Phase I action 
limit of 0.01 μg/L, thus triggering a Phase II A assessment. 
The risk quotient RQ (PEC:PNEC) for the sewage treatment plant, surface water and groundwater 
compartments were all below 1, thus indicating that the active substance poses a low environmental risk for 
these compartments. 
In the aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems study (OECD 308), FTC 
demonstrated significant shifting to the sediment (> 10%), thus triggering the sediment dweller organisms 
study (OECD 218) in Phase II B. The PEC:PNEC sediment ratio was determined to be below 1 and, therefore, 
FTC it is not expected to pose a risk to the sediment compartment. 
The results of the environment risk assessment of FTC are summarised in the Table 14

TAF is extensively transformed to TFV and the latter can, therefore, be considered the environmentally 
relevant residue of TAF. 
The n-octanol/water partition coefficient for TFV was determined to be below 4.5 and, therefore, a PBT 
assessment is not required.

The predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECsw) was calculated using a refined Fpen 
based on the prevalence of HIV in the member states and the value obtained was above the Phase I action 
limit of 0.01 μg/L, thus triggering a Phase II A assessment. 
The PEC:PNEC ratios for the sewage treatment plant, surface water and groundwater compartments were all 
below 1, thus indicating that the active substance poses a low environmental risk for these compartments. 
The adsorption /desorption study (OECD 106) indicated TFV to be persistent in the environment however it is 
not bioaccumulative (B) or toxic (T) and, therefore, not classified as a PBT substance. 
In the aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems study (OECD  308), more than  
10% of the applied radioactivity  was found associated with the sediment at or after day 7 of the study, thus 
triggering the assessment of toxicity to sediment dwelling organisms in phase II B. 
The PEC:PNEC sediment ratio was determined to be is below 1, thus indicating that TFV poses a low risk to 
the sediment compartment. 
The results of the environment risk assessment of TAF are summarised in the Table 15.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Detailed nonclinical data was provided in support of this application for FTC/TAF, including study reports for 
FTC and TAF and for FTC/TDF.  
In-vitro and ex-vivo studies demonstrated TAF uptake into PBMCs, conversion to TFV and phosphorylation to 
form the active form TFV-DP. TAF has demonstrated anti-HIV activity in studies using lymphoid T-cells, 
primary human PBMCs and macrophages. There would be limited impact of substituting TAF for TDF in the 
combination product based on studies examining cytotoxicity, off target toxicity, changes in mitochondrial 
function or metabolism toxicity.  Safety pharmacology studies revealed no significant concerns for TAF. The 
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of FTC and TFV/TAF were evaluated in vitro and in a 
variety of animal models. In addition, the drug-drug interaction profile was evaluated. The pharmacokinetics 
of the F/TAF FDC is discussed based on the results of nonclinical studies completed with the individual 
agents; no additional pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted for the F/TAF combination.   
The kidney and bone findings seen in the rat and dog toxicology studies are known toxicities of TFV. 
Prolonged PR intervals (approximately 13% to 24%) with associated QT interval prolongation were noted in 
the 39-week dog study. No PR prolongation or any change in ECG results occurred in the safety 
pharmacology study that evaluated a TAF dose up to 100 mg/kg or in the clinical thorough QT study. At 
18/12 mg/kg/day in dogs (39-week dog study), a minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in some 
organs (eye [choroid plexus, ciliary body], lung and spleen) in some animals. The posterior uveitis seen at 
18/12 mg/kg/day occurred at 3.7- and 17-fold higher exposures to TAF and TFV, respectively, than that 
observed in human subjects administered a 25 mg dose of TAF. In-life ophthalmologic examinations were 
normal in this study. There were no test article-related effects on ophthalmic exams or microscopic exams of 
ocular tissue observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice (up to 13 weeks), rats (up to 26 weeks), 
nonhuman primates (4 weeks, or in the 4-week dog toxicology study. Adverse degenerative (olfactory) and 
acute inflammatory (infiltrate neutrophil) changes in the nasal mucosa in mice given TAF for 13 weeks were 
not seen in other species and it can be agreed that they probably do not pose a clinical risk. 
In the rat fertility and reproductive toxicology study an increase in absolute testis weight (significant increase 
[9%] in the adjusted mean of the left testis only) was seen at 160 mg/kg/day. This was considered by the 
applicant to be test article-related but not adverse, as there were no other reproductive organ weight or 
functional reproductive effects. Sternebrae variants (1 to 4 and 5 and 6) were increased at 250 mg/kg/day in 
the rat embryo-foetal development study (the NOEL was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day [84 mg/kg/day 
achieved]). There were no effects seen the embryo-foetal development study in rabbits. Given that no peri-
/postnatal study was conducted with TAF, the product literature should contain the reproductive findings seen 
with TDF (i.e. reduced viability index and weight of pups in peri-/postnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic 
doses) or an omission of this information should be justified using relative exposures of TFV and TFV-DP after 
TAF exposure. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No major concerns have been identified from the nonclinical data. 
The environmental risk assessment of Descovy has shown that FTC does not bioaccumulate and is of low risk 
to the aquatic or terrestrial environments. TAF is a next generation pro-drug of tenofovir (TFV) and TFV has 
been identified as persistent in the environment, but it is considered to be of low risk to aquatic organisms, it 
is not bioaccumulative and does not pose significant risk to the environment.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
F/TAF resembles Truvada (TVD) except that TDF is substituted with TAF [GS-7340], which allows for 
ingestion of a very much lower oral dose (25 mg; 10 mg when boosted by COBI) compared to 245 mg TD. 
TAF is presented for clinical use as the fumarate (11 mg or 28 mg GS-7340-03 vs. 300 mg TDF) but all doses 
reported refer to the TAF content of the various formulations. The studies listed in Table 1 were conducted 
with TAF alone or with F/TAF in uninfected or HIV-infected individuals. The efficacy of F/TAF is heavily based 
on the studies conducted with E/C/F/TAF and bridging to these data via two bioequivalence studies (GS US 
311 1472 and GS US 311 1473). Details are not presented for studies that supported the approval of FTC or 
TVD or those submitted to support E/C/F/TAF except for those in which a group received TAF alone or F/TAF, 
which are repeated for convenience. Furthermore, some additional pharmacokinetic data were provided 
during the evaluation. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

In addition, GS-120-1101 was an early study with 50 mg and 150 mg doses of TAF as the monofumarate 
that assessed PK and antiviral efficacy during 14 days monotherapy. 
Formulations 
Two forms of TAF were used during clinical development: 
TAF monofumarate (GS-7340-02; 1:1 GS-7340 to fumarate) (GS-US-292-0101 and 120-1101) 
TAF fumarate (GS-7340-03; the hemifumarate form), with a 2:1 ratio of GS-7340 to fumarate 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 59/162 
  
  
 
 
TAF fumarate (GS-7340-03) was selected for further clinical development in various FDCs due to its 
enhanced purging capability of the process impurity GS-7339, increased thermodynamic stability in organic 
solvents and improved thermal stability compared to TAF monofumarate. 
The proposed commercial F/TAF FDC film-coated tablets are identical to those used in the pivotal 
bioequivalence studies (GS-US-311-1472 and 1473) and in Phase 3 (GS-US-311-1089). 
Methods 
Analytical methods 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The bioanalytical method for the determination of TAF in human plasma was validated at Quest 
Pharmaceutical Services, L.L.C (QPS). The method involved protein precipitation extraction of TAF 
and its internal standard (TAF-d7) from human plasma followed by LC MS/MS with positive ionization. 
The linear range was from 1 to 1000 ng/mL. 
Tenofovir (TFV) was initially assayed in plasma at QPS using an assay with a linear range from 0.3 - 
300 ng/mL. An improved version was used for assay of samples obtained from GS-US-120-0114 and 
0118 and another improvement led to the assay used for GS-US-311-1088.   
The bioanalytical method for the simultaneous determination of TAF and TFV in human urine was 
developed and validated at QPS. The method involved protein precipitation extraction of TAF, TFV and 
internal standards (TAF-d7 and TFV-d6, respectively) from human urine followed by LC MS/MS with 
positive ionization. The linear range was 2-1000 ng/mL for TAF and 10-5000 ng/mL for TFV. 
The bioanalytical method for the simultaneous determination of FTC and TFV in human plasma was 
initially developed at Gilead but further improved by QPS. The linear range was 5-3000 ng/mL for 
both analytes and this assay was used for GS-US-342-1167 and GS-US-311-0101. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Absolute bioavailability 
Absolute bioavailability has not been determined for TAF but the applicant estimates that this is ~ 40% in the 
absence of P-gp inhibition and ~90% when it is ingested with an inhibitor of P-gp (e.g. COBI or RTV).  
FTC-110 demonstrated that the absolute bioavailability of FTC is 93%.

GS-US-292-0101 was an open-label crossover study that compared two formulations (monolayer and bilayer) 
of E/C/F/TAF (each containing either 25 or 40 mg TAF as the monofumarate) with Stribild (STB) and TAF 25 
mg alone. Healthy subjects were assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts and randomised to 1 of 4 treatment sequences:  
Cohort 1 (10 M and 10 F) received: 
•  A: STR Formulation 1 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/25 mg TAF 
•  B: STR Formulation 1 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/40 mg TAF 
•  C: Stribild (STB) 
•  D: 25 mg TAF 
Cohort 2 (10 M and 10 F) received: 
• 
• 
E: STR Formulation 2 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/25 mg TAF 
F: STR Formulation 2 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/40 mg TAF 
•  C and D as above 
Each treatment was administered after a meal of 550-650 kcal and 25-30% fat.  
Dosing was for 12 days with 2-day washout periods between treatments.  
Following administration of E/C/F/TAF 25 mg in either formulation the exposures to TAF and TFV were 
substantially higher vs. TAF 25 mg administered alone. TAF AUClast and Cmax were ~2.2 and 2.3-fold higher, 
respectively, while TFV AUCtau and Cmax were ~3.1 and 3.7-fold higher, respectively. Mean TFV exposures 
(AUCtau and Cmax) following TAF alone were ~90% lower compared with those achieved after STB. TAF and 
TFV exposures after STRs containing 25 or 40 mg TAF were generally dose-proportional. For FTC there was 
bioequivalence between the E/C/F/TAF formulations and STB.

GS-US-292-0103 was an open-label crossover study in similar numbers of healthy male and female subjects 
aged 18 to 45 years per Cohort. 
Cohort 1 assessed the effects of the STR on EVG and COBI and subjects received in randomised order: 
•  A: STR containing EVG 150 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 10 mg 
•  B: EVG 150 mg + COBI 150 mg 
Cohort 2 assessed the effects of the STR on FTC and TAF and subjects received in randomised order: 
•  A: as above 
•  C: FTC 200 mg + TAF 25 mg 
Each treatment was administered once daily with food for 12 days with no washout periods.

There were 34 healthy subjects enrolled (Cohort 1-14; Cohort 2-20) with median ages of 26 years and 36 
years, respectively, and overall mean eGFRCG at baseline of 126.9 mL/min. 
The TAF and TFV exposures following administration of the 10 mg TAF as a constituent of the STR were 
comparable to those observed following administration of TAF 25 mg co-administered with FTC. The result 
confirmed the 2 to 3-fold increase in exposures observed when TAF was dosed with COBI. Specifically, the 
90% CIs around the GLSM ratios for TAF and TFV exposures relative to FTC + TAF 25 mg were within 70% to 
143%.  
The mean (%CV) TFV AUC and Cmax after multiple doses were > 90% lower than previously observed 
following administration of Stribild in GS-US-236-0110. FTC exposures were unaffected by formulation into 
E/C/F/TAF 10 mg.

GS-US-311-1386 was an open-label crossover study that evaluated the effect of food on F/TAF tablets. 
Dosing was on days 1 and 8 with a single F/TAF 200/25 mg tablet in the fasted state (A; reference) or after a 
high-calorie/high-fat meal of approximately 800 kcal and 50% fat (B; test). 
Administration of F/TAF under fed conditions resulted in a slightly lower TAF Cmax and delayed Tmax (by 30 
min). In contrast the GLSM ratios for TAF AUCs were ~175% (90% CI ~165, 188) for the fed vs. fasted 
state. Of note, TFV was not measured in this study.

a N = 33; AUCinf could not be calculated in 5 subjects for analyte TAF with Treatment B. 
As expected, FTC AUCs were unaffected by food, although slightly lower. Cmax was clearly reduced.

Compared to GS-US-292-0110, which assessed the PK of TAF after dosing E/C/F/TAF 10 mg STR under 
fasted and fed conditions (including the same meal type as above), the effect of food on TAF was greater 
after dosing with 200/25 mg F/TAF.

200 mg + TAF 25 mg. Dosing was after completion of a 600 kcal and 27% fat meal. Bioequivalence was 
demonstrated for each of TAF and FTC. The CSR states that TFV levels are not reported due to failure of the 
incurred sample reliability measure. The bioanalytical report states that the QCs spiked with GS-7340 plus 
TFV showed conversion of GS-7340 to TFV so the method did not control conversion effectively, particularly 
when the GS-7340: TFV ratio was high.

GS-US-120-109 
Study title: A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Metabolism and Excretion of GS-7340 
In the TAF metabolite profiling study GS-US-120-0109 the mean whole blood-to-plasma concentration ratio 
of [14C]radioactivity increased from 0.6 at 0.25 h post-dose to 2.4 at 216 h post-dose suggesting slower 
clearance of radioactivity from blood cells relative to plasma. Radioactivity was not detectable in blood for 6/8 
subjects at 504 h post-dose and the others had low radioactivity close to the LLOQ. 
In AD-120-2026 the in-vitro binding of TAF to human plasma proteins was evaluated using equilibrium 
dialysis conducted over 3 h at 37°C. Human plasma was spiked with TAF at a final concentration of 2 µM and 
LC/MS/MS was used with LLOQ 0.3 nM. The free fraction in human plasma was similar to that in dogs.  
Matrix

Free fraction of GS-7430 (%)

48.0 +/- 2.3 
However, in several human ex vivo studies it seems that the estimated unbound fraction was ~20%, i.e. 
lower than reported above (e.g. see the control groups in the renal and hepatic impairment studies). 
Based on POPPK analyses for each of TAF and TFV: 
o  For TAF the apparent volume of the central compartment (Vc/F) was 10.3 L and the apparent volume 
of peripheral compartment (Vp/F) was 447 L.  
o  For TFV the Vc/F was 1600 L and the Vp/F was 1670 L.

o  TFV Vc/F and Vp/F were lower in moderate renal impairment and higher in those with supra-normal 
eGFR compared to normals. Both were also lower in in healthy subjects vs. HIV-infected patients.  
Elimination 
Excretion 
In the TAF metabolite profiling study GS-US-120-0109 the total mean (± SD) recovery of [14C]radioactivity in 
faeces plus urine (n=7) was 84.4% (± 2.45%). The percent of radioactive dose recovered from faeces was 
47.2% (± 4.62%) and the percent recovered from urine was 36.2% (± 5.62%).

Metabolism 
In the TAF metabolite profiling study GS-US-120-0109 healthy male volunteers (median eGFRCG 117.5 
mL/min; range 87.7 to 198.2 mL/min) received a single TAF 25 mg capsule containing 24.15 mg TAF plus 
100 μCi [0.85 mg] radiolabeled [14C]TAF. Dosing was with water within 5 minutes of completing a 
standardised breakfast.  
Quantifiable levels of [14C]radioactivity were observed in whole blood for up to 360 h post-dose in most 
subjects but radioactivity was undetectable in plasma after 192 h post-dose.  
Quantifiable levels of TAF were observed in plasma for up to 6 h post-dose and then remained BLQ. TAF was 
extensively metabolised with only 1.41% (± 0.561%) of the total radioactive dose appearing in urine as TAF 
and no radioactive TAF was detected in faeces.

•  At the first maximal plasma radioactivity concentration around 2 h post-dose the predominant species 
was TAF, accounting for 72.6% of the total [14C]radioactivity quantified.  
•  At the second maximal plasma radioactivity concentration around 24 to 48 h post-dose the 
predominant species was uric acid, accounting for 97.6% of the total [14C]radioactivity quantified.  
Over 96 h post-dose the predominant species circulating in plasma was uric acid, which accounted for 73.9% 
of the total [14C]radioactivity AUC. The TAF and TFV AUCs represented 1.8% and 1.5% of the total 
[14C]radioactivity AUC, respectively. Low quantities of other metabolites were formed including xanthine, 
hypoxanthine and adenine (identical to the endogenous products of purine metabolism).

Note: M12 = TFV. 
Note: Pathways are proposed based on general knowledge of metabolism and do not imply definitive pathways. Direct experimentation was not performed. 
Inter-conversion 
TAF has 3 chiral centres. The potential for in-vivo isomerisation to occur was addressed as part of the 
E/C/F/TAF review and is considered to be negligible.  
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
Genetic polymorphisms in CatA have been described, some of which can result in depressed enzymatic 
activity. The potential for human polymorphisms in CatA to affect conversion of TAF to TFV was addressed 
and significant modulation of TAF PK profiles by inhibition or genetic polymorphisms of CES1 seems to be 
unlikely. However, the HCV PIs telaprevir and boceprevir can form covalent bonds with the serine 
carboxypeptidase and so inhibit CatA, which could reduce intracellular TFV-DP formation. The SmPC reflects 
this since co-administration with these agents is not recommended. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Dose proportionality 
In studies in which a range of TAF doses were used, including the monotherapy studies and the TQT study 
that used 25 mg and 125 mg doses, there was very approximate dose proportionality for TAF and TFV. 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 73/162 
  
  
 
Time dependency 
In GS-US-120-0109 plasma radioactivity showed two peaks and a time-dependent profile with TAF as the 
most abundant species in the first few hours and uric acid predominating in the remaining period.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The inter-subject variability in TAF plasma exposure varied across studies depending on whether intensive or 
sparse sampling was employed (% CV: 26% - 34% across Phase 1 studies and 58% - 118% across Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies). 
The inter-subject variability in TFV plasma exposure was generally modest/low and comparable across 
studies (% CV: 18% - 41% across Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies). The intra-subject variability in E/C/F/TAF 
Phase 1 studies was modest (<20%). The inter-subject variability in intracellular TFV-DP is greater than for 
TAF in plasma (see pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action).

Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Fixed Dose Combination in HIV-1 Infected, Antiretroviral 
Treatment-Naïve Adults 
This Phase 2 study GS-US-299-0102 compared D/C/F/TAF 10 mg with DRV/co + TVD. 
All patients had a single sample for PK at any time pre-or post-dose at Weeks 2, 4, 12, 16, 32 and 40 as well 
as trough levels at Weeks 8, 24 and 48. On or between the Week 4 and 8 visits, intensive profiling in plasma 
(21 TAF and 11 TDF) and/or PBMCs (14 vs. 8 per treatment group) was conducted in subsets of patients at 
selected study sites.  
The TAF PK parameters were consistent with historical data following D/C/F/TAF 10 mg and TAF 25 mg (GS-
US-120-0104, GS-US-299-0101). 
Table 33.  GS-US-299-0102: Summary of TAF Pharmacokinetic Parameters (All Substudy PK Analysis Set) 
The TFV plasma concentrations following D/C/F/TAF were markedly lower vs. DRV+COBI+TVD. 
Concentrations in the latter group were consistent with historical data for EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF. These results 
were consistent with those observed in other studies that compared TAF 25 mg with TDF 300 mg (GS-120-
1101 and GS-US-120-0104).

The analysis was conducted via nonlinear mixed-effects modelling with NONMEM 7.3.0 software. Due to 
expected differences in characteristic time scales of TAF and TFV concentrations (rapid elimination of TAF 
with no accumulation and much longer half-life of TFV leading to significant TFV accumulation) PK modelling 
was first performed separately for TAF and TFV. The final models for TAF and TFV were then combined into a 
joint model. 
For each of the separate models, the base model was first established followed by the development of the 
covariate model. One- and two compartment PK models with various oral absorption models were tried 
during base model development. Structural model refinement was based on various goodness-of-fit 
indicators, including diagnostic plots, plausibility and precision of the parameter estimates, the minimum 
objective function value and the number of estimated parameters.

Covariate modelling used a combination of the full model approach and backward elimination procedure. The 
covariates investigated were body size measures (weight, BSA or BMI), age, sex, race, creatinine clearance 
at baseline and population (healthy subjects, ARV-naive and ARV-experienced patients). Influence of 
identified covariates on exposure and a degree to which the covariate explained variability of exposure was 
determined by comparing 90% prediction intervals of estimated individual steady-state exposure parameters 
in the data set with the corresponding parameters computed from the models for typical subjects, where 
values of one covariate were altered from its reference value. For continuous covariates, 5th and 95th 
percentiles of the values in the data set were used; for categorical covariates, levels other than reference 
were used in computations. 
The available data for analysis are summarised in Table 39.

a. One additional TAF sample excluded from the covariate analysis and the final and joint models; 
b. Three additional TAF samples excluded from the covariate analysis and the final and joint models, resulting in 419 TAF samples from 241 subjects in the analysis; 
c. Two additional TAF samples excluded from the covariate analysis and the final and joint models; 
d. One additional TFV sample excluded from the covariate analysis and the final and joint models 
Visual predictive check simulations for the final models, for all data and stratified by covariates, indicated an 
agreement between the observed and simulated data. Model parameters obtained by bootstrap agreed with 
the parameters in the final models. 
TAF pharmacokinetics 
The two-compartment population PK model with absorption lag time and sequential zero- and first-order 
absorption described TAF concentrations. Extensive covariate analyses did not identify any covariates that 
had a statistically significant influence on TAF PK, and no covariates were retained in the final model.  
The mean (95% CI; % CV) predicted steady-state AUC and Cmax in the pivotal studies (GS-US-292-0104 
and GS-US-292-0111) were 206.4 (55.6 - 526.1; 71.8%) ng/mL*h and 162.2 (46.5 – 340; 51.1%) ng/mL, 
respectively. Elimination of TAF was rapid. AUCs by covariates are shown in Table 40.

TFV pharmacokinetics 
The predicted steady-state AUC, Cmax, and Cmin (95% CI; % CV) parameters in the E/C/F/TAF pivotal studies 
were 292.6 ng/mL*h (179.8 - 445.7 ng/mL*h; 27.4%), 15.2 ng/mL (9.3 - 23.1 ng/mL; 26.1%) and 10.6 
ng/mL (6.4 -16.6 ng/mL; 28.5%), respectively. The main covariate was CrCL. Although there was a 
statistically significant effect of HIV disease stratus on TFV PK, the range of TVF exposures across healthy 
and HIV infected was comparable and it was considered that the differences were not clinically significant.

Additional integrated ad hoc PK analysis 
The analysis used data from studies conducted with TAF 25mg or TAF 10 mg + COBI in healthy subjects or 
HIV-infected patients who received any of TAF 25 mg, F/TAF 200/25mg, E/C/F/TAF or F/TAF 200/10 mg + 
COBI and who had at least one Cmax or AUC for the respective analyte. Separate analyses were performed 
for data collected in the presence and absence of a boosting agent.   
TAF - Exposure following multiple administrations of TAF 25mg was similar to that with TAF 10 mg + COBI. 
There was no evidence of accumulation or time-dependent kinetics.

Weight (as a continuous covariate), age, BSA and race did not have a significant effect on TAF exposure in 
healthy subjects or HIV-infected patients. The integrated ad hoc PK analysis detected a statistically significant 
effect of sex, with higher exposure in females. The applicant considered that the finding was of no 
consequence due to the wide range of safe and efficacious TAF exposures.

GS-US-311-1089 - F/TAF Phase 3 Clinical Study 
Additional patient plasma TAF data became available during the evaluation from GS-US-311-1089, in which 
virologically suppressed patients switched to F/TAF from FTC/TDF or continued with their TDF-based regimen. 
A range of third agents was allowed in the regimens. Using the POPPK model the estimated mean TAF 
AUCtau and Cmax values and the estimated mean TFV AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau values in this switch study were 
consistent with those observed in E/C/F/TAF Phase 3 studies. The comparable TAF and TFV exposure data (at 
a dose of 25 mg in an unboosted regimen and 10 mg in a boosted regimen) supported bridging F/TAF to the 
E/C/F/TAF efficacy and safety database.

Figure 8 presents TAF exposures across several studies by third agents along with those from the E/C/F/TAF, 
F/TAF and D/C/F/TAF studies. These data support achievement of therapeutic TAF exposures when TAF at 
recommended doses is administered with those third agents. Importantly, these results are concordant with 
those from Phase 1 studies as illustrated in Figure 9, where GS-US-311-1089 exposure data are shown to be 
similar to those from Phase 1 DDI studies. The analysis includes data from a DDI study of F/TAF (10 mg) 
with ATV+COBI provided during the procedure that shows a mean (%CV) TAF AUClast of 192 ng*h/mL (30.9 
% CV) when co-administered with ATV+COBI (GS-US-311-1388).

TAF 
In severe renal impairment there was a 92% (< 2-fold) higher mean plasma AUCinf, 92% higher AUClast and 
79% higher Cmax. Correspondingly the mean plasma TAF CL/F was lower (61,717.8 mL/h vs. 117,633.1 
mL/h, respectively, p = 0.003) but the half-life was not statistically significantly different. At 1 and 4 h the 
mean percent unbound TAF was not different between those with severe renal impairment (20.0% and 
14.2%) vs. controls (20.1% and 13.6%). Approximately 0.117 mg TAF (0.47% of the dose) was excreted in 
urine in renally impaired subjects vs. ~0.500 mg (2.00%) in controls with renal clearance of 4.2 mL/min and 
35.8 mL/min, respectively. 
TFV  
In severe renal impairment there was much higher (about 5-6-fold) plasma exposure to TFV vs. controls with 
lower plasma and renal clearance but no significant difference in half-life. TFV plasma protein binding at 2 
and 24 h was not different between groups (e.g. 99.2% vs. 98.9% at 24 h). Approximately 30% vs. 24% of 
the dose was excreted in urine. The plasma TFV exposures (mean TFV AUCinf 2073.8 ng•h/mL vs. 342.6 
ng•h/mL for controls) were within or below the TFV exposure ranges of subjects with normal renal function 
taking TDF 300 mg once daily

E/C/F/TAF study GS-US-292-0112  
This open-label study in HIV-infected patients with eGFRCG in the range 30-69 mL/min included an intensive 
PK/PD sub-study in which plasma was collected ≤ 30 min pre-iohexol and then at 5 min and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 
1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 24 h post-dose. Single PK samples were also obtained from all patients for use in 
POPPK analyses. In summary 
TAF - TAF PK parameters were consistent with data obtained from HIV-infected patients with normal renal 
function in E/C/F/TAF studies (mean AUClast 254.2 ng*h/mL compared to 227.5 ng*h/mL, 229.8 ng*h/mL 
and 259.0 ng*h/mL) as well as from healthy subjects (AUClast 244.8 ng*h/mL). Exposure to TAF was

numerically higher in those with baseline eGFRCG < 50 vs. ≥ 50 mL/min but it was less than the mean AUClast 
(510.6 ng*h/mL) in subjects with eGFRCG 15-29 mL/min in GS-US-120-0108. 
TFV – TFV plasma levels were higher in those with screening eGFRCG 30 to 69 mL/min compared to the HIV-
infected patients in E/C/F/TAF studies (mean TFV AUCtau 552.7 ng*h/mL vs. 326.2, 311.8 and 286.2 
ng*h/mL; see section 2.1.8 above) but well below the TFV exposure in those with eGFRCG 15-29 mL/min in 
GS-US-120-0108 (mean AUCinf 2073.8 ng*h/mL) and after TDF-containing regimens (see 2.1.8). As 
expected, exposure to TFV was higher in those with baseline eGFRCG < 50 vs. ≥ 50 mL/min. 
FTC - FTC plasma levels were higher in those with screening eGFRCG 30 to 69 mL/min compared to the Phase 
2 E/C/F/TAF patients (mean AUCtau 20,968 ng*h/mL vs. 11,714.1 ng*h/mL). Exposures were higher in those 
with baseline eGFRCG < 50 vs. ≥ 50 mL/min. These data are consistent with the FTC PK parameters observed 
in subjects with mild (CrCL = 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCL = 30 to 49 mL/min).

Impaired hepatic function 
TAF study GS-US-120-0114 
Study Title: A Phase 1, Open-Label, Parallel-Design Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of GS-7340 in 
Subjects with Severe Renal Impairment 
Single doses of 25 mg TAF were administered with water immediately after completion of a moderate-fat 
meal (600 calories, 27% fat). Subjects were enrolled as follows: 
Cohort 1:  
Group 1: Subjects with mild hepatic impairment (CPT Class A score of 5-6) (n = 10) 
Group 2: Subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10) 
Cohort 2: 
Group 1: Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (CPT Class B score of 7–9) (n =  
10) 
Group 2: Subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10) 
The plasma exposure parameters of TAF and TFV were considered to be comparable between subjects with 
mild hepatic impairment and matched controls. In those with moderate hepatic impairment the plasma 
exposure parameters for TAF were slightly higher and exposures to TFV were slightly lower vs. matched 
controls. The differences observed were not considered to be clinically relevant. 
TAF plasma protein binding was measured in all subjects at 1 and 4 h post-dose. The mean unbound TAF 
ranged from 16% to 19% in mild hepatic impairment and from 14% to 23% in moderate hepatic impairment. 
TFV plasma protein binding was measured in all subjects at 2 and 24 h post-dose. The mean unbound TFV 
was > 99% in mild or moderate hepatic impairment. For TAF and TFV binding was similar to controls.

In the E/C/F/TAF study GS-US-292-0108 after multiple dosing: 
The AUCs of all analytes were lower in Japanese vs. Caucasian subjects. For FTC the lower bounds of the 
90% CI were well below 80% for AUCtau and Ctau. For TAF the lower bound of the 90% CI was well below 
80% for AUClast. For TFV the lower bounds of the 90% CI were well below 80% for AUCtau and Ctau.  
Age 
Plasma exposures to TAF in adolescents treated with E/C/F/TAF in GS-US-292-0106 were very similar to 
those in adults. This open-label study was conducted in 2013-2014 at 9 sites across 4 countries in ARV-naïve 
HIV-infected adolescents (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight  ≥ 35 kg, plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 
copies/mL, CD4 cell counts > 100 cells/μL and eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Schwartz formula) at screening. 
All patients received E/C/F/TAF QD with food, at approximately the same time each day.  
In Part A: 18 to 24 patients (at least 6 aged 12 to < 15 years and 6 aged 15 to < 18 years) were to be 
enrolled to evaluate steady-state intensive PK at Week 4 and confirm use of the adult dose of E/C/F/TAF. 
Based on cross-study comparisons with HIV-infected adults treated with E/C/F/TAF the data suggested no 
difference between ARV-naïve adolescents and adults (data from GS-US-292-0102) for TAF or TFV plasma 
exposures as shown below.

In the POPPK analysis of TAF (E/C/F/TAF in HIV-infected patients), which consisted of 915 aged 18 to < 55 
years and 197 aged ≥  55 years of age, age was not a covariate and did not have an effect on TAF exposures. 
In addition, the individual estimates of AUClast showed no notable trend of TAF exposures with increasing 
age, as shown in the scatter plot from the integrated ad hoc PK dataset.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Cytochrome P450 inhibition 
The inhibitory activity of TAF with human liver microsomal CYP isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A) was assessed at concentrations up to 25 μM. TAF showed weak 
inhibition of CYP3A-mediated oxidation of midazolam or testosterone with IC50 values of 7.6 or 7.4 µM, 
respectively. 
The potential for TAF to be a mechanism-based inhibitor of human CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6) was assessed at 50 µM. There was no evidence for time- or cofactor-
dependent inhibition of any enzyme by TAF. The maximum change in activity observed was 17.4% with 
CYP2C8 relative to control. 
TFV at 100 μM did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A. 
Cytochrome P450 induction 
CYP induction was assessed from mean fold increases in mRNA in cultured human hepatocytes from 3 
separate donors treated with 1, 10, and 100 µM TAF once daily for 3 consecutive days. Due to cytotoxicity 
cell viability was significantly affected at 100 µM TAF and mixed responses to TAF with increased mRNA levels 
and reduced CYP activities were observed. At 1 and 10 µM there were no significant increases in mRNA levels 
or CYP activities. At 10 µM TAF the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 increased by 3.0- and 8.3-fold, which 
correspond to 3% and 6% of the induction levels observed with respective positive controls. TAF showed little 
or no potential for CYP induction at clinically relevant concentration (1 µM).

Transporter studies 
TAF 
TAF showed little or no inhibition of the transport of model substrates by P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. 
Weak inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, OCT1 and MATE1 was observed but none was inhibited by 50% 
at 100 µM TAF, which is approximately 200-fold Cmax in plasma. TAF did not inhibit UGT1A1 up to 50 µM. 
There was no significant induction of P-gp and UGT1A1 mRNA on exposure to TAF.  
TAF is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. An increase in TAF absorption was observed in the presence of efflux 
transport inhibitors CsA or COBI. Co-administration of TAF with efflux inhibitors may potentiate antiviral 
efficacy by increasing TFV-DP levels in PBMCs.  
TAF is also a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Exposure to TAF may be 
affected by inhibitors of these transporters or genetic polymorphisms affecting activities.  
TAF was not a substrate for renal transporters OAT1 and OAT3. 
TFV 
Active tubular secretion of TFV is mediated by human OAT1 and MRP4 acting in series in proximal tubules. 
Human OAT3 may play a secondary role in the tubular uptake of TFV.  
Under physiologically relevant conditions, none of the tested drugs affected OAT1-mediated transport of TFV. 
MRP1 is not involved in TFV reabsorption at the basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells. 
Neither P-gp nor MRP2 appear to be involved in the tubular efflux of TFV. 
Tenofovir did not inhibit human OCT2 or MATE1 (IC50 > 300 μM). 
Other relevant information 
There is no evidence for inhibition of TFV renal excretion by FTC. TFV and FTC do not inhibit each other's 
pharmacological activation through phosphorylation. 
Activation of human AhR or human PXR 
At 50 µM TAF the extent of activation of PXR was only 23% of the maximal effect of rifampicin and 15 μM TAF 
demonstrated activation of < 5% of the maximal induction elicited by rifampicin. TAF did not activate AhR up 
to 50 µM, the highest concentration tested.

In Cohort 1 FTC/TAF (40 mg) plus EFV resulted in no clinically relevant changes in FTC, TFV or TAF AUCs or 
Cmax compared with FTC/TAF (40 mg) dosed alone based on the pre-defined acceptance criteria but they 
were all lower in the presence of EFV. The applicant considered that the differences were not clinically 
meaningful. 
In Cohorts 2 and 3 co-administration of FTC/TAF (25 mg) with DRV/co (800/150 mg) for 10-12 days 
resulted in comparable exposures to TAF and FTC but substantially higher TFV exposures vs. FTC/TAF (25

mg) dosed alone in Cohort 2. There was an increase in TAF AUClast and Cmax following single doses, 
suggesting an inhibitory drug interaction giving increased availability of TAF that abated following multiple 
dosing. The increase in TFV but not TAF exposures after multiple-dose co-administration was thought to be 
due to a mixed inhibitory/inductive effect of COBI on P-gp, influencing TAF absorption.  
FTC exposures were consistent with historical data (e.g. GS-US-236-0101 and 0110).  
There was no effect of co-administration with FTC/TAF on DRV PK. 
In Cohort 4 COBI exposures were in the range of historical data (GS-US-216-0112 and 0124). Co-
administration of TAF 8 mg plus COBI 150 mg resulted in substantially higher TAF and TFV exposures relative 
to TAF 8 mg dosed alone. The effects of COBI on TAF and TFV were consistent with the data from GS-US-
292-0101, in which E/C/F/TAF was compared with TAF alone. The applicant ascribed the effect to COBI-
mediated inhibition of P-gp-mediated intestinal secretion of TAF.

Study Title: A Phase 1, Adaptive-Design, Multiple-Dose Study Evaluating the Bioavailability of Three 
Formulations of Darunavir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/GS-7340 Single Tablet Regimen (STR) Relative to the 
Administration of Individual Components Cobicistat-Boosted Darunavir, Emtricitabine, and GS-7340 
GS-US-299-0101 was in three parts of which Parts 1 and 3 provide the data of some relevance for use of 
F/TAF 200/10 and 200/25 mg tablets. 
Part 1 was primarily designed to identify a possible formulation for a STR containing DRV/co plus F/TAF using 
either 10 or 25 mg. Subjects were randomised (1:1:1 ratio) to one of: 
A: F1 monolayer tablet containing DRV 800 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg 
B: F2 bilayer tablet containing DRV 800 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg 
C: F3 monolayer tablet containing DRV 800 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 10 mg 
Plasma exposures to TAF and TFV were proportionately lower with F3 (C), were highest on day 1 and did not 
change between days 6 and 21 (TAF) or days 12 and 21 (TFV). DRV, COBI and FTC plasma concentrations 
were similar between the three formulations. Using a non-validated LC-MS/MS assay the Day 12 TFV-DP 
AUC0-12 values as measured in PBMCs were higher with F1 and F2 vs. F3 and were within a range associated 
with antiviral activity in the TAF monotherapy study GS-US-120-0104.

Note: Data are presented as mean (%CV). 
Note: Formulation 1 was a monolayer tablet with 25 mg GS-7340, Formulation 2 was a bilayer tablet with 25 mg GS-7340,and Formulation 3 was a monolayer 
tablet with 10 mg GS-7340. 
Part 3 had 2 cohorts, each of crossover design: 
Cohort 1 received C as above and separately received DRV 800 mg + COBI 150 mg 
Cohort 2 received C as above and separately received FTC 200 mg + TAF 25 mg 
All dosing was after completion of a 400 kcal meal containing 13 g fat.   
In Part 3 Cohort 1 bioequivalence was demonstrated for DRV and COBI. 
In Part 3 Cohort 2  
TAF plasma concentrations were lower following treatment C vs. FTC + TAF, with a difference that was 
similar on days 1 and 24 after single or multiple dosing. In contrast, TFV plasma concentrations were higher 
following multiple (but not single) once-daily administrations of treatment C vs. FTC + TAF. Nevertheless, 
TFV exposures were ~88% lower than observed following DRV/co + TVD in Part 2 (GLSM AUCtau 3352 
ng.h/mL and Cmax 342 ng/mL).

FTC exposures were higher following treatment C vs. FTC + TAF. Although the GLSM values and 90% CI were 
all > 100% the upper limit of 125% was not exceeded.   
Table 51.  GS-US-299-0101: Statistical Analysis of Emtricitabine Pharmacokinetics Parameters (Part 3, 
Cohort2: Emtricitabine PK Analysis Set) 
As in GS-US-311-0101, the TAF AUClast and Cmax were higher (~30% to 50%) following a single dose of 
each STR formulation vs. multiple doses, which the applicant considers is consistent with a mixed 
inhibitory/inductive effect on TAF absorption.  
The TFV exposures with treatment C (10 mg TAF) were in the range of those observed after TAF 25 mg given 
as a single agent. The applicant considered that the substantial increase in TFV exposures without a change 
in TAF exposures after multiple-doses reflected a mixed inhibitory/inductive effect on P-gp influencing TAF 
absorption. The decrease in TAF levels following multiple doses was thought likely to be due to an inductive 
effect of DRV on P-gp.

Having selected treatment C for further development, the comparison with FTC + TAF 25 mg was considered 
to support the FDC since, although TAF exposures were lower after the FDC, they were in a range associated 
with antiviral activity in the monotherapy study (GS-US-120-0104).  
GS-US-120-0118 
Study Title: A Pharmacokinetic Study Evaluating the Drug Interaction Potential of Tenofovir Alafenamide 
with a Boosted Protease Inhibitor or Unboosted Integrase Inhibitor in Healthy Subjects 
This was an open-label study in which 40 healthy subjects (10 per cohort) received the following treatments 
once daily with a moderate fat meal: 
Treatment A:    
FTC 200 mg + TAF 10 mg  
Treatment B:    
ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg  
Treatment C:    
DRV 800 mg + RTV 100 mg  
Treatment D:    
4 × LPV/r 200/50 mg  
Treatment E:    
DTG 50 mg   
Treatment F (same as A):  
FTC 200 mg + TAF 10 mg  
FTC plasma levels were not measured in this study. 
TAF AUCs and Cmax were higher following FTC+TAF plus ATV/r (cohort 1) or LPV/r (cohort 3) vs. FTC+TAF 
alone. ATV/r had the greater effect on TAF AUCs. LPV/r had the greater effect on Cmax. 
Mean TAF AUCs after FTC+TAF alone were generally comparable with those when it was given in the 
presence of DRV/r (cohort 2) but Cmax was higher on co-administration and all 90% CI suggested slightly 
greater exposures on co-administration with DRV/r.  
Mean TAF AUCs and Cmax after FTC+TAF plus DTG were higher vs. dosing alone (cohort 4). 
The applicant ascribed the increases in TAF exposure seen with ATV/r and LPV/r to the known effect of RTV 
as P-gp inhibitor. The effect of DRV/r was ascribed to the inductive effect of DRV combined with the inhibitory 
effect of RTV on P-gp. It was concluded that F/TAF 200/10 mg should be used with these boosted PIs. The 
applicant considered that there was no effect of DTG on TAF and therefore F/TAF 200/25 mg should be used 
in conjunction with INSTIs and with other classes not known to have an effect on P-gp, such as NNRTIs.  
Mean TFV AUC and Cmax were higher on co-administration in each cohort but the greatest effect was 
observed with LPV/r (cohort 3) and the least with DTG (cohort 4).

Study data became available during the evaluation. In this multiple dose study F/TAF 10 mg and ATV/co 
(300/150 mg; co-administered as separate tablets) were each given alone and together once daily with food 
for periods of 6-7 days. The PK data were as follows:

Co-administration with ATV/co increased the plasma exposures to both TAF (~1.75-fold) and TFV (~3.5-fold) 
as expected from strong intestinal P-gp inhibition by COBI. 
It is pertinent to note that in the previously reported DDI study GS-US-120-0118 FTC 200 mg + TAF 10 mg 
were given alone on Day 1 and also co-administered with ATV/r (300/100 mg) on day 15, after 13 days 
dosing with ATV/r alone. All dosing was in the fed state. FTC was not measured in this study. As reported 
above, the TAF and TFV AUCs and Cmax were higher following FTC+TAF plus ATV/r vs. FTC+TAF alone. The 
magnitude of effect of RTV on TAF AUC and Cmax was very similar to that exerted by COBI above and the 
effect of RTV on TFV was greater than for TAF as was observed for COBI.

Study Title: A Fixed-Sequence, Open-Label, Study Evaluating the Pharmacokinetics and Drug Interaction 
Potential between Tenofovir Alafenamide and Midazolam (Oral and Intravenous) in Healthy Volunteers 
This study evaluated co-administration of TAF with oral and IV midazolam dosed after standard breakfasts: 
Treatment A (Day 1):    
MDZ 2.5 mg oral syrup 
Treatment B (Day 3): 
MDZIV 1 mg IV over 1 min

TAF 25-mg tablet + MDZ 2.5 mg oral syrup 
Treatment E (Day 18):   
TAF 25 mg tablet + MDZ 1 mg IV over 1 min 
TAF had no significant effect on plasma MDZ or 1’OH-MDZ after oral dosing based on 90% CI that fell within 
80, 125%. The 90% CI for MDZ AUCs were slightly higher on co-administration (did not span 100%) but the 
metabolite was not similarly affected.

There was 25% to 30% decrease in TAF Cmax (25% to 30%) after co-administration with oral or IV MDZ, 
which the Company proposed may reflect an effect of MDZ on gastrointestinal motility. The AUCs were also 
slightly lower on co-administration but relatively less affected (~10-15% decreases).

Study title: A Fixed-Sequence, Randomized, Open-Label, 2-Cohort, 2-Period, Multiple-Dose Study Evaluating 
the Pharmacokinetics and Drug Interaction Potential between Tenofovir Alafenamide and Rilpivirine in Healthy 
Subjects 
RPV is primarily metabolised by CYP3A but is expected to induce CYP3A4 at 25 mg QD. It also inhibits P-gp in 
vitro but did not affect PK of digoxin in vivo. This study was in two cohorts who received either TAF 25 mg or 
RPV 25 mg followed by co-administration after standardised breakfasts.  
Plasma PK parameters for TAF were unaffected by co-administration for 14 days in that 90% CI around Cmax 
and AUC ratios all fell within 80, 125% and spanned 100%. For TFV the 90% CI fell within 80, 125% but all 
exceeded 100%, indicating slightly higher exposures on co-administration. The RPV AUC was unaffected by 
co-administration whilst Cmax was slightly lower and Ctau was slightly higher.

SER is eliminated by several CYP450 enzymes including CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. 
The percentage contribution of each isoform has been estimated to be ~35%, 29%, 14%, 13% and 9%, 
respectively. COBI is an inhibitor of CYP3A (major) and CYP2D6 (minor). Dosing was after standardised 
breakfasts as follows: 
A: SER 50 mg tablet, single dose on day 1 
B: E/C/F/TAF (10 mg) once daily for 12 days on days 2-14 
C: SER 50 mg single dose on day 14 (i.e. with the last dose of E/C/F/TAF 10 mg)

Co-administration had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of EVG, COBI, FTC, TAF, TFV or SER. All except 
two comparisons gave 90% CI that fell within 80, 125% and in the two exceptions (COBI Ctau and SER AUC0-

GS-US-342-1167 – E/C/F/TAF with Sofosbuvir [SOF] and Velpatasvir [VEL] 
Study Title: A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions between

Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF; Atripla), 
Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF; Complera), Dolutegravir (DTG; 
Tivicay), or Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafemamide Fumarate (EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF) in 
Healthy Subjects 
This was an open-label, multiple-dose, 4-cohort study to evaluate co-administration of SOF/VEL (400 mg/100 
mg tablets) with each of EFV/FTC/TDF (Atripla), FTC/RPV/TDF (Eviplera), dolutegravir (DTG) and E/C/F/TAF 
(10 mg). 
Only Cohort 4 has some potential relevance to F/TAF. This cohort was dosed within 5 minutes of completing 
breakfast (~ 600 kcal, 25-30% fat) and with randomised order of treatments as follows: 
J: SOF/VEL once daily for 8 days 
K: E/C/F/TAF once daily for 8 days 
L: SOF/VEL plus E/C/F/TAF once daily for 8 days 
Co-administration of SOF/VEL with E/C/F/TAF resulted in an increase in SOF, GS-331007 and VEL exposures, 
which were attributed to COBI.  
Exposures to EVG and FTC were not altered following co-administration with SOF/VEL.  
There was ~100% increase in COBI Ctau when E/C/F/TAF was given with SOF/VEL. Due to the relatively short 
COBI t 1/2 (~3.5 h) there was no impact on AUC COBI. 
VEL inhibits P-gp but there was no effect of co-administration on TAF (P-gp substrate) or TFV since COBI 
already effected P-gp inhibition. 
The applicant concluded that SOF/VEL may be administered with E/C/F/TAF 10 mg.

This was an open label, multiple-dose, 3-way cross-over study to evaluate the potential for interactions 
between F/R/TAF and SOF, its metabolites (GS-566500 and GS-311007) or LDV.  Healthy subjects (42) were 
randomised to one of six treatment sequences and received the following 3 treatments: 
A: LDV/SOF 1 × 90/400 mg tablet once daily under fed conditions in the morning  
B: FTC/RPV/TAF 1 × 200/25/25 mg tablet once daily under fed conditions in the morning 
C: LDV/SOF + FTC/RPV/TAF using the two FDCs as above under fed conditions in the morning  
Each treatment in the sequence was taken for 11 days with no washout periods.

Co-administration with LDV/SOF did not notably affect the PK of FTC or RPV. Compared to FTC/RPV/TAF 
alone co-administration led to increases in TAF and TFV AUCtau of 32% and 75%, respectively. TFV Cmax was 
increased by 62% and Ctau by 85% but there was no effect on TAF Cmax. Co-administration with 
FTC/RPV/TAF did not notably affect the PK of LDV or SOF (including its metabolites GS-566500 or GS-
331007). The applicant discussed that the increase in TFV exposures of approximately 75% was consistent 
with the mechanistic understanding of the interaction between the P-gp inhibitor LDV and the P-gp substrate 
TAF. It was pointed out that the mean TFV AUCtau on co-administration (467 ng*hr/mL) is approximately 5 
times lower than TFV exposure following dosing with TDF (AUCtau 2290 ± 690 ng*hr/mL). As such, the 
differences in overall TFV exposure were not considered to be clinically relevant and no dose adjustment of 
FTC/RPV/TAF is proposed.

GS-US-337-1624 - E/C/F/TAF plus sofosbuvir (SOF) and ledipasvir (LDV) 
Study title: A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Potential between 
Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) Fixed-Dose Combination (FDC) Tablet and HIV Antiretroviral Regimen 
Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) FDC Tablet 
This was a randomised, open label, multiple-dose study to assess co-administration of the LDV/SOF and 
E/C/F/TAF FDCs. Healthy subjects were randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences and received the following 
3 treatments for 10 days each, all administered with a moderate far meal in the morning: 
o  LDV/SOF: LDV/SOF (90 mg/400 mg tablet once daily) (Treatment A) 
o  E/C/F/TAF: E/C/F/TAF (150 mg/150 mg/200 mg/10 mg tablet once daily) (Treatment B) 
o  LDV/SOF+E/C/F/TAF: A+B (Treatment C) 
Following co-administration there were increases in SOF (28% to 47%) and GS-331007 (48% to 66%) 
primary PK parameters were observed relative to administration of LDV/SOF alone. The 90% CIs for the 
GLSM ratios for GS-566500 PK parameters were contained within the protocol predefined lack of PK alteration 
boundaries. Co-administration resulted in higher LDV AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau of approximately 79%, 65%, 
and 93%, respectively, consistent with intestinal P-gp and/or BCRP inhibition by COBI.  
These effects on LDV/SOF are consistent with those observed following co-administration of 
LDV/SOF+EVG+COBI. The exposures observed were within the exposure-safety range, as defined by the 
PK/PD analyses from the LDV/SOF clinical development programme. Following co-administration no effect of 
LDV/SOF was observed on FTC, TAF and TFV. There was no effect on EVG AUCtau and Cmax but Ctau was 
approximately 46% higher. There was also no effect on COBI Cmax but AUCtau and Ctau were approximately 
53% and 225% higher. 
The higher COBI exposure was not considered to be clinically relevant since prior data indicated no 
association between COBI exposure and the incidence of common AEs or renal function parameters. 
Additionally, the Ctau and AUCtau are not expected to introduce further drug interaction potential based on 
prior study of the dose/exposure-response relationship between COBI and CYP3A inhibition. Thus, no dose 
adjustment of E/C/F/TAF or LDV/SOF was thought necessary when they are co-administered.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
TAF is predominantly hydrolysed to TFV by Cathepsin A (CatA) cleavage in target lymphoid cells. TFV (which 
is itself a monophosphate) is then metabolised to the active moiety TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP). TFV-DP is a 
competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 RT. In T-cells, macrophages and PBMCs TAF EC50 values ranged from 3 to 14 
nM. The in-vitro activity of TAF against HIV-1 is 100- to 600-fold greater than TFV and 4- to 6-fold greater 
than TDF. For TAF intracellular activation pathways in lymphoid cells and tissues, refer to Figure 1.  
Cathepsin A levels and the intracellular activation of TAF were evaluated in primary CD4+ T lymphocytes and 
MDMs isolated from PBMCs from 13 donors of variable gender, age and ethnicity. Cathepsin A activity was 
determined by measuring the rate of conversion of TAF to TFV-alanine in extracts prepared from quiescent 
and PHA/interleukin-2 (IL-2) activated CD4+T cells and MDMs. For both primary cell types the levels of active 
CatA were comparable across donors and the mean rate of TFV-alanine formation was similar between 
quiescent and activated CD4+T cells (2.7 vs. 3.0 pmol/min•μg) with ≤ 3-fold differences between donors. In 
both primary cell types, the intracellular accumulation of TAF metabolites and conversion of TAF to TFV-DP 
were consistent across the 8 demographically diverse donors. 
Results from in-vitro experiments are consistent with passive diffusion of TAF into HIV-target cells. While TAF 
was found in vitro to be a substrate for the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, PBMCs 
express only low levels of transporters and do not express OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Based on available data, 
there is no evidence for transporter-mediated uptake of TAF into PBMCs. 
Following incubation of PBMCs with increasing concentrations of TAF from 13.7 nM to 10 μM, the intracellular 
concentration of TFV-DP increased proportionally with TAF loaded dose (Table 58). These results are 
consistent with an in-vivo uptake mechanism into PBMCs via passive diffusion because saturation was not 
observed at TAF levels significantly higher than those achieved in the clinic. 
Table 58.  Intracellular TFV-DP Levels Detected in PBMC Loading Studies with TAF 
BLQ = below limit of quantitation (limit of quantitation: 0.5 μM) 
Since TAF is a pro-drug of TFV it is affected by the same resistance associated mutations (RAMs). In-vitro 
studies indicated that TAF and TFV have similar propensities to select for mutational resistance and that EC50 
values are affected to a similar extent by various mutations and combinations of mutations. However, the 
Assessment report

applicant postulated that the in-vivo resistance profile may differ when dosing with TAF or TDF since the level 
of TFV DP achieved after TAF is significantly higher than that after TDF.  
Viral breakthrough experiments were conducted using known TDF-resistant HIV-1 isolates in MT-2 cells to 
model the impact of the higher TFV-DP concentrations. These experiments were conducted at a higher 
multiplicity of infection (MOI) compared to typical EC50 assays; the EC50 values for TAF and TFV were 0.02 
and 5 µM, respectively. The cells were incubated in the presence of TAF or TFV (concentrations were 
equivalent to the EC95 [estimated at 10 × EC50] with a 5-fold increase for TAF) followed by HIV-1 infection. 
After 4 or 5 days of incubation cultures were scored for viral breakthrough (i.e., CPE) and the procedure was 
repeated every 4 to 5 days for up to 4 weeks. TAF inhibited viral breakthrough for the duration of the 
experiment for 9/11 viruses but viral breakthrough was only inhibited for 2/11 viruses in the presence of TFV. 
However, breakthrough of viruses with 5 TAMs was not prevented by TAF or TFV.

Tolerance, Pharmacokinetics, and Antiviral Activity of GS-7340-02 in Antiretroviral-Naïve Patients Who Are 
Chronically Infected with HIV-1 
This study explored the antiviral activity of TAF (50 mg and 150 mg QD as the monofumarate) vs. TDF during 
14 days monotherapy in 30 ARV-naïve patients (27 male) with plasma HIV-1  RNA ≥ 15,000 copies/mL and 
CD4  cell  count  ≥  200  cells/mm3  at  screening.  TFV  was  detectable  within  PBMCs  earlier,  more  consistently, 
and  at  greater  concentrations  after  TAF  vs.  TDF.  DAVG1,  2  and  3  were  all  significantly  greater  in  the  TAF 
groups compared to TDF but there was no significant difference between the TAF doses.

Study Title: A Phase I Randomized, Partially-Blinded, Active and Placebo-Controlled Study of the Safety, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Antiviral Activity of GS-7340 Monotherapy in Subjects with HIV-1 
TAF  monotherapy  was  compared  to  TDF  and  placebo  over  10  days  in  patients  with  HIV-1  RNA  >  2000 
copies/mL, CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and without use of ARVs within 90 days. Randomisation (2:2:2:1:2) 
was to TAF at 8, 25 or 40 mg or to TDF 300 mg or placebo. At steady state, the mean TFV AUCtau after TAF 
doses  were  97%,  86%  and  79%  lower,  respectively,  vs.  the  mean  after  TDF dosing  and  Cmax  values were 
98%, 94% and 89% lower, respectively.  
The peripheral blood mononuclear cell TFV-DP concentrations were highly variable but the mean AUCtau was 
similar between TAF 8 mg and TDF 300 mg and was ~ 7-fold and ~ 25-fold higher after 25 mg and 40 mg 
doses  of  TAF,  respectively.  The  antiviral  effect  of  GS-7340  8  mg  was  similar  to  that  of  TDF  300  mg.  There 
were statistically significantly greater decreases in viral load with 25 mg and 40 mg TAF doses compared to 
TDF 300 mg. The first phase decay slopes for plasma HIV-1 RNA in the TAF 25 mg and 40 mg groups were 
also significantly steeper than for TDF 300 mg.

PK-PD analyses 
Using  data  from  TAF  monotherapy  GS-US-120-0104  study  the  PK/PD  relationships  between  TAF  and  TFV 
plasma  exposures  and  antiviral  activity  were  explored  using  a  maximum  (PD)  effect  (Emax)  model.  The  TAF 
AUC fitted well with an Emax model, with an Emax of ~1.7 to 1.8 log10 decline from baseline and the EC50 for 
AUC of ~32 ng•h/mL. A similar fit/Emax estimate was obtained using TAF Cmax, which was somewhat expected 
given its brief plasma half-life and the resulting contribution of the Cmax to the overall AUC. Upon comparison 
of antiviral activity with 40 mg and previous data with 150 mg (GS-120-1101), TAF 25 mg was expected to 
provide near-maximal activity (~1.7 to 1.8 log10 copies/mL). Plasma TFV exposure, which was  substantially 
lower with TAF versus TDF, did not correlate with antiviral activity. The Figure below also shows the AUCs on 
dosing healthy subjects with 25 mg TAF without a P-gp inhibitor in fed and fasted states in GS-US-311-1386.

The PK/PD analysis sets from these Phase 3 E/C/F/TAF studies included all ARV-naïve patients who received a 
dose of E/C/F/TAF and had at least one TAF or TFV PK parameter (AUCtau or Cmax) estimated from the POPPK 
analysis. Virologic success was uniformly high across TAF AUCtau quartiles with no trends in 
exposure-response relationship observed.

These results support the selection of TAF 10 mg for use with COBI (or other agent with similar PK effects on 
TAF) based on equivalent exposure to unboosted TAF 25 mg, which was concluded to provide near maximal 
antiviral efficacy in the monotherapy study. The results are also in accordance with the lack of statistically 
significant covariates on PK in the POPPK analyses and the comparable efficacy observed across patient 
subgroups according to demographics. 
The data were also used to explore the exposure-safety relationships in these two studies, focusing on 
diarrhoea and nausea (very common), vomiting and GI/abdominal pain (common). 
• 
For diarrhoea and GI/abdominal pain, both the TAF and TFV exposure was comparable regardless of 
the presence or absence of either of those symptoms and no exposure-AE trends were observed. 
Assessment report

• 
For nausea and vomiting, the TFV exposure was comparable regardless of the presence or absence of 
either of those symptoms with no exposure-AE trends noted. Logistic regression analysis showed a 
trend between the highest TAF exposure and the presence of these AEs (nausea correlated with the 
highest 4% of TAF exposure; vomiting correlated with the highest 19% of TAF exposure). No trend 
was observed between TAF exposure and severity. 
•  Across all TAF and TFV AUCtau quartiles, the percentage change from baseline at Week 48 in BMD 
was comparable; no trends in exposure-changes in BMD were noted. 
•  Across all TAF and TFV AUCtau quartiles, the maximum increase from baseline in serum creatinine 
was comparable; no trends in exposure-changes in serum creatinine were noted. 
These Phase 3 E/C/F/TAF studies also provided intracellular TFV-DP concentrations following administration of 
E/C/F/TAF vs. STB. There was a >4-fold higher intracellular concentration of TFV-DP (based on the AUCtau 
GLSM ratio) when TAF was given vs. TDF.

Study Title: Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, switch study to evaluate F/TAF in HIV-1 positive subjects

The results from the PK/PD analysis of this Phase 3 F/TAF study, in which virologically suppressed patients 
switched to F/TAF from FTC/TDF (Truvada), were similar to those from the E/C/F/TAF Phase 3 studies. F/TAF 
and FTC/TDF were administered without regard to food. 
TAF AUCs from GS-US-311-1089 were estimated from a TAF population PK model. Based on the population 
PK model as well as the observed plasma concentration data, predicted individual PK parameters were 
estimated and used to simulate TAF concentration-time profiles that were subsequently used for non-
compartmental analysis to obtain individual AUC and Cmax values. TAF AUCs were estimated for 292 
subjects. 
The estimated TAF exposures and clinical efficacy of F/TAF by third agent in this study are shown below. 
Maintenance of viral suppression was similar across the different third agents when used with recommended 
F/TAF doses, regardless of the variable TAF exposures achieved, and comparable to the FTC/TDF group.

Use with a boosted-DRV regimen provides support for efficacy at the lower end of TAF exposure. In GS-US-
299-0102 the percentages with < 50 c/mL in the D/C/F/TAF vs. DRV+COBI+FTC/TDF groups were 74.8% vs. 
74.0% at Week 24 and 76.7% vs. 84.0% at Week 48. 
TAF AUCs from 52 patients in this study were estimated from a TAF population model. The virologic success 
rates were similar across the quartiles of TAF AUCs, with no trends in exposure-response relationship.

Similarly, no apparent trend was observed with virologic failure at Week 48 and TAF exposures. The exposure 
range observed in this D/C/F/TAF study was similar to that in the E/C/F/TAF pivotal studies and F/TAF Phase 
3 study. In addition, the intracellular TFV-DP exposure ratio of 6.5 (compared to TDF) was consistent with 
the E/C/F/TAF studies. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
TFV is presented for clinical use as a nucleotide analogue, i.e. it is already monophosphorylated. The effects 
of combination of TFV with other agents that require intracellular phosphorylation has been investigated in in-
vitro studies. Combination with ABC did not change the rates of phosphorylation of either compound to the 
triphosphate (active) forms.

GS-US-120-0107  
Study Title: A Phase 1, Partially-Blinded, Randomized, Placebo- and Positive-Controlled Study to Evaluate 
the Effect of GS-7340 on the QT/QTc Interval in Healthy Subjects 
GS-US-120-0107 evaluated single doses of 25 mg and 125 mg TAF. Pharmacokinetic parameters for TAF and 
TFV following single oral doses of 25 or 125 mg TAF were approximately proportional to dose. The lower 
bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean difference between moxifloxacin and placebo was > 5 ms at 2 
post-dose time points (3 and 4 h) establishing assay sensitivity. At these respective time points the actual 
changes were -1.4 and +4.1 ms for moxifloxacin compared to -12.9 and -7.1 ms for placebo.  
For the primary analysis, TAF was concluded to have no QTcF prolongation effect as the upper bounds of the 
2-sided 90% CIs for the mean difference between 25 mg and 125 mg TAF and placebo were below 10 ms at 
each time point after dosing. Small negative changes in QTcF were observed at both doses. Analyses of 
secondary endpoints (QTcB, QTcN and QTcI) were consistent with the primary analysis. 
In the categorical analyses no subject had a treatment-emergent absolute QTc interval > 500 ms or a change 
from pre-dose baseline QTc > 60 ms with any correction factor following any treatment. No subject had a 
treatment-emergent absolute QTc interval > 480 ms or a change from pre-dose baseline > 30 ms following 
either dose of TAF. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Doses of TAF in F/TAF  
Based on the combined observations from TAF monotherapy studies GS-US-120-1101 and -0104, there did 
not appear to be an advantage in terms of antiviral effect for TAF doses higher than 25 mg QD administered 
alone in the fasting state. For the 25 mg dose the day 10 mean and median TAF AUClast values were 115 and 
109 ng.h/mL, respectively while the mean and median AUCtau values for intracellular TFV-DP levels were 21.4 
and 15.8 µM.h. 
It was calculated that when TAF is co-administered with strong inhibitors of P-gp (such as COBI and RTV) the 
dose should be ~10 mg TAF in order to provide steady state plasma TAF and TFV exposures and antiviral 
effects similar to those achieved with ~25 mg TAF given alone. To confirm this calculation, GS-US-292-0103 
compared E/C/F/TAF containing 10 mg TAF with FTC 200 mg + TAF 25 mg. After multiple daily dosing with 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016

food, the plasma TAF AUClast values were 250.2 and 278.2 ng.h/mL for respective formulations and both Cmax 
and AUC met the bioequivalence criteria although the TAF AUC was numerically lower for 10 mg TAF in the 
presence of COBI vs. F/TAF 25 mg.  
In contrast, the plasma TFV was slightly higher after dosing 10 mg TAF with COBI vs. F/TAF 25 mg, although 
the upper bound of the 90% CI was 131% (see GS-US-292-0103 pharmacokinetic results). 
In order to support presentation of F/TAF containing 10 mg or 25 mg and to support bridging these 
formulations to the efficacy observed in the Phase 3 E/C/F/TAF studies in the ART-naive three bioequivalence 
studies were conducted in healthy subjects dosed after standard meals. However, it should be noted that TFV 
was not measured in these three studies so that the apparent discrepant effects on TFV noted in GS-US-292-
0103 could not be further verified.  
Study GS-US-311-1088 established that F/TAF (200/25 mg) was bioequivalent to co-administration of FTC 
200 mg + TAF 25 mg. The TAF AUClast values were 245.9 and 238.5 ng.h/mL, respectively. 
Study GS-US-311-1472 established that F/TAF (200/10 mg) co-administered with EVG 150 mg and COBI 150 
mg was bioequivalent to E/C/F/TAF 10 mg in terms of TAF and FTC. COBI and EVG concentrations were the 
same for the two groups. The TAF AUClast values were 336.6 and 340.2 ng.h/mL, respectively. 
Study GS-US-311-1473 established that F/TAF 200/25 mg given without EVG/COBI was bioequivalent to 
E/C/F/TAF 10 mg in terms of TAF and FTC. The TAF AUClast values were 374 and 369 ng.h/mL, respectively. 
Bridging to efficacy data  
The prediction of efficacy when using F/TAF 10 mg or 25 mg with third antiretroviral (ART) agents rests 
mainly on PK bridging of F/TAF doses to the efficacy documented for E/C/F/TAF 10 mg in Phase 3 studies in 
ART-naïve patients. Bridging is supported by comparisons with exposures documented with D/R/F/TAF 10 mg 
in a Phase 2 study in ART-naïve patients (GS-US-299-0102) and those reported from a switch study in 
virologically-suppressed patients who received either strength of F/TAF with a range of third agents (GS-US-
311-1089). For each dataset the contribution of F/TAF to the overall efficacy observed cannot be determined 
and has to be inferred from comparisons of plasma levels.  
In study GS-US-292-103, although plasma TAF was very slightly lower on dosing with Genvoya, the plasma 
TFV AUC was lower after dosing with F/TAF 25 mg. This finding, which remains mechanistically unexplained, 
suggested an effect of COBI on the compartmental disposition of TFV.  
The finding raised a question regarding the basis for extrapolation of efficacy from Genvoya to F/TAF 
regardless of the third agent co-administered and whether or not the regimen included P-gp inhibitors COBI 
or RTV.  
It also raised a question regarding the CNS levels of TFV-DP that may be achieved with F/TAF, and, hence, 
the efficacy of various TAF-containing regimens against HIV within the CNS.  
The applicant responded to these concerns during the procedure and the questions were referred to the SAG 
HIV/Viral Diseases. When considering these issues the following observations have some relevance. 
To ascribe the difference in TFV plasma levels that was observed when TAF was administered with or without 
COBI to a differential effect on the whole body distribution of TFV would require that systemic concentrations 
of COBI are sufficient to exert effects on relevant transporters outside of the gut.  
In vitro, COBI inhibits the transporters P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MRP-2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Its effect on 
plasma exposures to substrates of P-gp and/or BCRP via inhibition at the gut level is clear. There are modest

Page 111/162 
  
  
changes in TFV exposure when TDF (a known substrate of P-gp) is given with inhibitors of intestinal P-gp, 
including COBI and RTV. In addition, COBI is predicted to inhibit intestinal BCRP and MRP2 at concentrations 
theoretically achievable in the intestinal lumen following a 150 mg oral dose. The results of a study to 
evaluate whether MRP2 or BCRP could contribute to the intestinal efflux transport of TDF were submitted 
during the evaluation of the Tybost dossier and indicated that this could occur. However, in the context of 
plasma TFV levels after oral administration of TAF, it should be noted that TFV is not a substrate for P-gp, 
MRP2 or BCRP and its renal elimination should not be affected by COBI based on the calculated Cmax,u/IC50 
ratios.  
Regarding the potential for systemic effects on other transporters it is clear that COBI reaches sufficient 
concentrations to inhibit MATE1 in the kidney, with consequent effects on serum creatinine. It is also 
predicted to have weak to modest effects resulting in increased exposures to OATP1B substrates. In the 
interaction study with digoxin, in which Cmax and AUC0−last increased but AUCinf remained unchanged on co-
administration, there was a numerical decrease in the digoxin t1/2 from 38 to 30 h, which was unexpected in 
light of the calculations described above suggesting that COBI would not reach sufficient systemic 
concentrations to inhibit renal P-gp and so affect elimination of digoxin in urine. This effect on t1/2 remains 
unexplained and in a small DDI study it may not represent a true difference. 
Overall, existing knowledge regarding COBI and its effects on transporters, as well as the substrate profile of 
TFV, do not explain the modest difference in TFV plasma levels observed when TAF was given with and 
without COBI to healthy subjects. There is no clear basis for concluding that the difference truly reflects 
different whole body distribution of TFV when TAF is administered with or without COBI. 
TFV is not the active moiety but is the moiety associated with adverse renal and bone effects. Since TFV 
plasma levels were slightly lower for F/TAF 25 mg vs. TAF 10 mg given with COBI there is no reason to 
expect a worse safety profile for F/TAF when used without COBI compared to Genvoya. In addition, the 
safety data from GS-US-311-1089, in which subjects either switched to TAF or remained on TDF, each with 
FTC and a wide range of third agents (including PI/r combinations), indicated that the safety profile for TAF-
treated patients vs. TDF-treated patients was consistent with observations made in the Phase 3 Genvoya 
studies that compared Genvoya with Stribild. 
The remaining issue was whether the supposed difference in whole body distribution of TFV in the presence 
and absence of COBI could bring into question the validity of bridging F/TAF (either strength, with or without 
COBI or RTV) to the Genvoya Phase 3 efficacy data by means of TAF bioequivalence. Thus, to consider 
whether the durable anti-viral activity observed so far in plasma when dosing TAF as part of Genvoya, 
accompanied by lack of any signal for neurocognitive disorders caused by HIV-1 in the CNS, would apply 
when dosing TAF within other ART regimens.  
As part of this concern regarding bridging of efficacy, it was questioned whether CNS penetration of TAF and 
formation of the active moiety TFV-DP in brain parenchyma could be different in the presence vs. absence of 
COBI. In addition, it was questioned whether control of HIV-1 within the CNS could vary depending on the 
third agent used with F/TAF. On this latter theme, in light of the concurrent application for F/R/TAF and in 
relation to the uncertainties of the CHMP regarding the efficacy of RPV 25 mg QD, it was questioned whether 
patients taking this FDC could be at particular risk of HIV-related neurocognitive disorders. Thus, several 
issues culminated in a series of questions that covered both the efficacy of F/TAF when used with third agents 
other than EVG/co, including but not limited to RPV, and the associated potential for HIV-1 neurocognitive 
disorders to occur.

With regard to the brain levels of the active moiety (TFV-DP) when TAF is given orally, the theoretical 
concern is that systemic levels of inhibitors of transporters known to be located at the BBB (including P-gp, 
BCRP and MRP-4) could suffice to have a clinically important impact. Hence, if COBI or RTV were to exert 
some inhibition of these transporters at the BBB, the efflux of their substrates from the brain might be 
reduced. TAF is a substrate of P-gp and BRCP but TFV is not a substrate of either of these transporters. 
Theoretically brain parenchyma concentrations of TAF and TFV-DP could be relatively higher when TAF is 
dosed with vs. without COBI or RTV.  
Regarding possible effects of COBI and RTV on P-gp or BCRP activity in the CNS the most important 
transporters that restrict the permeability of toxins and drugs across the BBB are the ABC transporters P-gp, 
BCRP and MRP-4. Hence, whilst they are neuroprotective, these transporters can restrict the entry of drugs 
that are substrates. Potentially, induction or inhibition of important transporters at the BBB could reduce or 
increase brain parenchyma concentrations of substrates, respectively. Substrates of P-gp include most HIV 
PIs, abacavir, maraviroc and raltegravir.  
In-vitro data have shown that P-gp induction could occur at the BBB during chronic treatment with ARTs 
identified as ligands of hPXR and/or hCAR. In vitro, AhR was not induced by COBI or the three human 
metabolites tested (COBI showed no induction up to 3 µM and 1.6-fold induction at 10 µM, which is similar to 
RTV (fold induction ~0.80). COBI showed weak activation of PXR in vitro (1.6-fold at 3 µM and 2.2-fold at 10 
µM) but had a lesser effect than RTV (3.6 to 10.1-fold across the same concentrations). For comparison, 
COBI plasma Cmax is about 1-2 µg/mL while 10 µM is about 7.76 µg/mL.  
COBI and RTV are (net effect) weak inhibitors of P-gp. The total effects of COBI and RTV on transporters that 
can result in increased systemic bioavailability of many drugs are exerted at the intestinal level. There is a 
low probability that they could inhibit transporters at the BBB when given at the recommended clinical doses. 
TFV and TAF poorly penetrate into the CSF, likely resulting in concentrations well below EC50 for HIV reverse 
transcriptase. However, as reported by Kalvass et al. (2013) in a review conducted by the International 
Transporter Consortium (ITC), transport processes at the blood-CSF barrier can be functionally different than 
those at the BBB. For example, P-gp and BCRP secrete substrates into the CSF at the blood–CSF barrier, but 
at the BBB they act as efflux transporters pumping substrates into blood. In contrast, MRP4 acts as an efflux 
transporter at both the BBB and the blood–CSF barrier. The authors point out that effects on the activity of 
BCRP or MRP4 at the BBB are not likely to result in clinically relevant effects. As elaborated by the authors, 
drug detection and drug concentrations in CSF may not provide an accurate reflection of concentrations in 
brain parenchyma. CSF concentrations are often not representative of unbound brain concentrations for 
substrates of P-gp, BCRP and/or MRP4. Furthermore, TFV-DP is the active moiety but it is formed only within 
cells. Hence it cannot be assumed that TAF and TFV levels measured in CSF necessarily correlate with 
inhibition of HIV-1 replication by TFV-DP within the brain. 
Kalvass et al. (2013) also discuss uptake transporters at the BBB. In light of the possibility that COBI could 
have effects on other (as yet untested or unrecognised transporters) this potential effect of COBI cannot be 
ruled out but it would only be important whenever TAF was a sensitive substrate. 
In the switch study GS-US-311-1089 there were no differences in efficacy or safety of F/TAF when used with 
a boosted PI or unboosted third agents, including no signal for neurocognitive disorders. However, the 
demonstration of efficacy in a population in which HIV-1 replication is already profoundly suppressed may not 
be relevant to initiation of treatment in the ART-naïve. In addition, only 3 patients received F/TAF+RPV in 
this switch study. Therefore the switch study efficacy data cannot per se overcome the theoretical concerns 
that have been raised.

HIV-1 replication in the CNS is thought to occur in perivascular macrophages and/or microglia within the 
brain parenchyma. In patients with cognitive impairment, HIV-1 RNA in the CSF is derived primarily from 
enriched perivascular macrophages and migrating monocytes. Although plasma TFV exposures with TAF are 
~90% lower vs. TDF, intracellular TFV-DP levels are typically 4- to 7-fold higher. Theoretically it may be that 
TAF is able to load migrating monocytes more effectively than TDF prior to entry into the CNS. 
Neuro-symptomatic replication of HIV-1 in the CNS (in which CSF HIV-1 RNA is higher than in plasma) does 
occur but appears to be rare and is mostly documented anecdotally via case reports or series. In reported 
cases of concurrent virologic failure in the CSF and plasma it is not possible to determine whether plasma 
virologic failure followed CSF virologic failure or vice versa. Generally the evidence supports a conclusion that 
clinically significant escape replication of HIV-1 in the CNS is extremely unlikely to occur when there is 
successful suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA regardless of the regimen sued and the predicted CNS 
penetration of the active moieties. In addition, there is only a very remote possibility that escape replication 
in the CNS would lead to failure to control plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. 
In summary, although there remains a theoretical possibility that the presence of a P-gp inhibitor as part of 
an overall TAF-containing ART regimen could affect distribution of TAF into the brain and, thus, TFV-DP 
levels, the overall picture at present suggests that this is a remote possibility. CSF levels of TFV or TAF 
cannot be regarded as highly predictive of TFV-DP in the brain. There is at least a theoretical possibility that 
use of TAF rather than TDF could improve on levels of TFV-DP achieved in the CNS replicating sites.  
The general experience with the more highly effective ART regimens that have become available especially in 
the last decade support a conclusion that effective and sustained virologic suppression in plasma is 
associated with CSF virologic suppression or, at least, only asymptomatic and usually temporary detection of 
HIV-1 RNA in CSF. There is no reason to think that rates of plasma virologic failure or CSF virologic failure 
are more likely to occur with regimens containing TAF vs. otherwise identical regimens containing TDF. Thus, 
F/R/TAF should exert similar activity to Eviplera when used in accordance with identical restrictions and 
warnings and there is no good reason to expect that the risk of escape HIV-1 replication in the brain is any 
greater with the former vs. the latter. The Applicant committed to provide any publicly available data from 
planned studies that will evaluate CSF penetration of TAF and/or TDF. 
Bridging for efficacy 
When making comparisons across studies presented in the dossier it is pertinent to remember that in the 
POPPK analysis based on the E/C/F/TAF studies the applicant concluded that HIV disease status did not have 
an effect on TAF exposure and was not a statistically significant or clinically relevant covariate. The estimated 
TAF AUClast values were 250 ng.h/mL for healthy subjects vs. 206 ng.h/mL for HIV-infected patients, noting 
that patients were to take E/C/F/TAF with food. In the additional integrated ad hoc PK analysis in the F/TAF 
dossier, from which the applicant again concluded that there was no clinically relevant difference in TAF 
exposures between healthy subjects and HIV-infected patients, the estimated TAF AUClast for TAF 10 mg + 
COBI in HIV-infected patients, derived from studies in which patients received E/C/F/TAF with food, was 
~240 ng.h/mL. It could be argued then that the target TAF AUC to support bridging of efficacy to the most 
robust dataset (the Phase 3 E/C/F/TAF studies) would be somewhere between ~200-250 ng.h/mL. 
When F/TAF 25 mg is administered without a P-gp inhibitor the estimated AUClast in patients is 127 ng.h/mL, 
i.e. similar to that observed with 25 mg TAF in the monotherapy study and also similar to the value of 133 
ng.h/mL observed when F/TAF 25 mg was administered in the absence of food and without a P-gp inhibitor in 
the food effect study GS-US-311-1386 (the TAF AUC in the fed state in this same study was 234 ng.h/mL). 
In contrast, when TAF 10 mg was administered as a component of E/C/F/TAF the TAF AUC last was 206 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 114/162 
  
  
ng.h/mL in the fasted state vs. 240 ng.h/mL after a meal. Therefore when F/TAF 10 mg was administered 
with a strong P-gp inhibitor there was no important effect of food. For F/TAF 25 mg (i.e. the dose to be used 
without a strong inhibitor of P-gp as the third agent in the regimen), the TAF AUC approaches that derived 
from E/C/F/TAF efficacy studies only when F/TAF is given with food. This observation raised a question 
regarding the applicant’s proposal in the SmPC that F/TAF could be given without food regardless of co-
administration with a P-gp inhibitor. 
In this regard it was appropriate to also consider the PK data from the Phase 2 study GS-US-299-0102 that 
compared DRV/COBI/FTC/TAF 10 mg with DRV/co plus TVD in ART-naïve patients. The mean TAF AUClast was 
130 ng.h/mL but the intracellular TFV-DP value was 17.1 vs. 2.6 µM.h in the TDF group. The TAF exposures 
were therefore similar to 25 mg given alone in the fasting state in the monotherapy study. However, in this 
small Phase 2 study the regimen containing TAF was numerically inferior to the regimen containing TDF. 
Additional data came from the Week 48 results of the switch study in the virologically suppressed. Due to the 
design the efficacy data can only be viewed as supportive but, as in the Phase 2 and 3 studies described 
above, there was no detectable relationship between TAF plasma levels and efficacy. The plasma TAF AUCs 
when F/TAF 25 mg was taken without a strong intestinal P-gp inhibitor and without regard to food overlapped 
with those for co-administration of F/TAF 10 mg with ATV/r. 
Furthermore, although TFV-DP levels must be viewed with some caution (data is expressed in pg/million cells 
and not in µM), they supported consistently higher levels with TAF vs. TDF regardless of the regimen.

In conclusion, the data generally supported expectations that the efficacy of F/TAF 10 mg administered 
regardless of food in the presence of a P-gp inhibitor and F/TAF 25 mg administered regardless of food in the 
absence of a P-gp inhibitor, should provide broadly comparable efficacy. 
Dose of F/TAF when given with other strong inhibitors of P-gp 
The applicant proposed that F/TAF 10 mg should be used when it is co-administered with one of the specified 
boosted PIs. Thus, F/TAF 25 mg was to be recommended when the third agent in the ART regimen is not a 
strong inhibitor of P-gp regardless of whether or not the patient is taking another concomitant medication 
that is a strong P-gp inhibitor. This proposal did not raise efficacy concerns, however it cannot be ruled out 
that chronic exposure to plasma TFV concentrations higher than observed with Genvoya (even though much 
lower than observed with TDF) could eventually result in the types of safety issues associated with TDF on 
bones and renal function. As a consequence, section 4.5 advises that F/TAF 10 mg is given when non-ART 
potent P-gp inhibitors (including ciclosporin, ketoconazole and itraconazole) are concomitantly administered.  
Dose of F/TAF when given with various ARTs  
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016

The applicant proposed that F/TAF 10 mg should be the dose used when it is given with a boosted PI 
(specifically ATV/co, ATV/r, DRV/co, DRV/r and LPV/r) whereas F/TAF 25 mg should be used with other ARTs 
(specifically mentioning DTG, RPV or EFV). To support these recommendations the applicant conducted 
several DDI studies. The data supported co-administration of F/TAF 25 mg with DTG or RPV. 
There remained some concern regarding the adequacy of F/TAF 25 mg when given with EFV, especially if TAF 
were to be taken with EFV on an empty stomach. In the DDI study conducted in the fasted state the Cmax 
and AUClast for each of TAF, TFV and FTC were lower on co-administration and failed to meet the usual 
bioequivalence criteria but the applicant dismissed the finding. Although GS-US-311-1089 indicated that for 
patients who took F/TAF 25 mg with EFV the plasma TAF AUCs were relatively high vs. other third agents, the 
intracellular TFV-DP levels were the lowest observed by third agent. With < 10 patients treated with F/TAF + 
EFV in a switch study the fact that 8/8 maintained suppression was not necessarily reassuring, especially 
when it is not known if TAF was taken at a different time and possibly with food. However, TFV-DP levels 
were comparable with those associated with efficacy in the monotherapy study. It was finally concluded that 
F/TAF 25 mg could be given with EFV, and this is reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC where actual changes 
are shown.  
In addition, there remained some concern regarding the adequacy of F/TAF 10 mg when given with DRV/co 
or DRV/r. This was mainly due to the plasma TAF and intracellular TFV-DP levels observed with 
DRV/COBI/FTC/TAF in GS-US-299-0101 in healthy subjects, which fell considerably short of those in patients 
in Phase 3 E/C/F/TAF studies. Also, in the Phase 2 study GS-US-299-0102 in which DRV/COBI/FTC/TAF 10 
mg was compared with DRV/co plus TVD, the mean TAF AUClast was 130 ng.h/mL, i.e. very similar to the 
value documented in GS-US-299-0101 in healthy subjects but admittedly also similar to the TAF AUC with 25 
mg monotherapy. In GS-US-299-0102 the percentages with < 50 c/mL in the D/C/F/TAF vs. 
DRV+COBI+FTC/TDF groups were unusually low for an ART-naïve patient study at 74.8% vs. 74.0% at Week 
24. At Week 48 rates were 76.7% vs. 84.0%. Additional data indicated that there was also a disadvantage 
for D/C/F/TAF at week 24 based on the <20 c/mL cut-off. However, this was a relatively small Phase 2 study 
that was not powered for inferential testing. Rather than preclude use of F/TAF 10 mg with DRV/r or DRV/co, 
the CHMP considered that it was important to add the efficacy results based on the <20 c/mL cut-off to 
section 5.1 and to cross refer to this section from the posology for DRV combinations in 4.2. In addition, 
section 4.2 should specify that DRV 800 mg QD was the dose used. 
When F/TAF 10 mg was given with ATV/r or LPV/r TAF exposures were in the range observed with TAF 25 mg 
monotherapy. Taking into account the applicant’s additional TAF AUCs from patients treated with F/TAF 10 
mg and these PI/r combinations in GS-US-311-1089 and a recently completed DDI study of F/TAF (10 mg) 
with ATV+COBI, the plasma levels provided some degree of reassurance regarding the adequacy of the TAF 
10 mg dose with ATV/r or ATV/c.  
Additional data on the differential effects of PI/P-gp inhibitors on TAF vs. TFV 
Concomitant use of FTC/TAF 25 mg with DRV/co (800/150 mg) in the fed state for 10-12 days resulted in 
comparable exposures to TAF and FTC but ~3-fold higher TFV exposures vs. FTC/TAF (25 mg) dosed alone. 
The increase in TFV but not TAF exposures after multiple-dose co-administration was ascribed to a mixed 
inhibitory/inductive effect of COBI and DRV on P-gp, influencing TAF absorption. Furthermore, co-
administration with ATV/co increased the plasma exposures to both TAF (~1.75-fold) and TFV (~3.5-fold) 
but, as was also observed in the DDI study with ATV/r (~1.9-fold TAF and ~2.5-fold TFV increases), the 
magnitude of effect on TFV was considerably more than that on TAF.  
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 116/162 
  
  
The applicant acknowledged that the extent of increases in TFV was higher than increases in TAF when co-
administered with a P-gp inhibitor but the exact mechanism for the relative change in TAF and TFV exposures 
remains unknown. The interaction mediated by P-gp inhibition (and mixed inhibition/ induction effects in the 
case of DRV/r) likely involves interplay of P-gp and metabolizing enzymes such as esterases both in the 
intestine and liver.  
Taking into account data with TDF, it was considered that the effects observed were unlikely to reflect 
changes in elimination of TFV. GS-US-216-0134 investigated the PK of COBI and TFV following multiple dose 
administration of COBI and TDF alone or in combination. Results showed a ~50% increase in TFV Cmax but 
moderate increase in AUC (~20% increase) when TDF was co-administered with COBI, with no change in TFV 
t 1/2. This suggested a local, gut-related interaction between a P-gp inhibitor and TDF at the intestinal level 
and that elimination of TFV was not affected.  
Irrespective of the potential mechanism for changes in metabolite exposure, any increase in TFV exposure 
resulting from co-administration of TAF with other concomitant medications is expected to be well below the 
TFV exposures observed in patients receiving TDF-containing regimens. Therefore, although lack of a clear 
explanation remains somewhat unsatisfactory, it seems unlikely that there are unidentified DDI mechanisms 
that will result in TFV exposures after TAF dosing that approach those observed with TDF. 
Co-administration of TAF with inducers of P-gp 
The applicant reported the results of GS-US-311-1387, which assessed the magnitude of the interaction 
between TAF and a strong P-gp inducer (carbamazepine). The ~50 % reduction in plasma TAF observed in 
the presence of a potent inducer of P-gp may not matter too much in terms of intracellular TFV-DP if F/TAF is 
also given with a potent P-gp inhibitor. However, if F/TAF is not given with a potent P-gp inhibitor the 
consequences for efficacy could be very variable and unpredictable. The situation could be exacerbated if 
F/TAF is also taken without food and/or with EFV, which would not be precluded in the SmPC. 
Initially the applicant proposed to recommend dosing with food to address the effect of P-gp induction but 
TAF AUC increased 175% in the food effect study only when it was given with a high-calorie/high-fat meal of 
approximately 800 kcal and 50% fat. It certainly cannot be assumed that patients would take it with such a 
meal routinely. Overall, there is a risk of inadequate TAF and hence TFV-DP levels if F/TAF is taken with a 
potent inducer of P-gp. There does not seem to be a good reason to accept such a risk. Therefore, section 
4.5 was modified to advise that co-administration of F/TAF with potent inducers of P-gp is not recommended. 
Uptake of TAF into PBMCs 
The applicant has not been able to identify any specific mechanism(s) of uptake of TAF into PBMCs and 
proposes that this occurs via passive diffusion. If there were to be any reason why TAF uptake into PBMCs 
was reduced to a level below that achieved with TDF 300 mg there would have to be a concern for efficacy. 
Results from in-vitro experiments are consistent with passive diffusion of TAF into HIV-target cells. While TAF 
was found in vitro to be a substrate for the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, PBMCs 
express only low levels of transporters and do not express OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Furthermore, anti-HIV 
activity of TAF in combination with various third agents, including many known to act as transport inhibitors, 
has been tested in vitro in an HIV-1 IIIB infected T-lymphoblastoid cell line. There was no antagonistic anti-
HIV effect observed between TAF and any of the other agents tested. Based on available data, there is 
currently no evidence for transporter-mediated uptake of TAF into PBMCs. 
The major route of TAF uptake into primary hepatocytes is passive diffusion so that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
make a small contribution. This hypothesis is supported by combination intracellular metabolism experiments

in primary hepatocytes where the effects of COBI, telaprevir and boceprevir on intracellular levels of TFV-DP 
were assessed. These compounds are known to inhibit OATP1B1 with IC50 values of 2.5 μM, 2.2 μM and 18 
μM, respectively, and to inhibit OATP1B3 with corresponding IC50 values of 1.9 µM, 6.8 μM and 4.9 μM. None 
of these compounds affected intracellular TFV-DP levels at concentrations up to 50 μM. Despite the results 
with the positive control bosentan in this study, the results support a conclusion that OATP1B1/1B3 inhibition 
in primary human hepatocytes does not have a very marked effect on TAF uptake.  
Conversion of TAF to TFV-DP and onward metabolism 
The applicant selected TAF for potential clinical use based on its rapid disappearance from plasma, efficient 
loading into PBMCs and efficient intracellular conversion to TFV. The latter is proposed to occur via CES1 and 
CatA to form TFV-alanine which is then hydrolysed in lysosomes to form TFV. The applicant has concluded 
that TAF is primarily hydrolysed by CatA in PBMCs. Cathepsin A is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional 
enzyme with deamidase, esterase and carboxypeptidase activities. Genetic polymorphisms in CatA have been 
described, some of which can result in depressed enzymic activity. The potential for human polymorphisms in 
CatA to affect conversion of TAF to TFV was addressed and significant modulation of TAF PK profiles by 
inhibition or genetic polymorphisms of CES1 seems to be unlikely. However, the HCV PIs telaprevir and 
boceprevir can form covalent bonds with the serine carboxypeptidase and so inhibit CatA, which could reduce 
intracellular TFV-DP formation. The SmPC reflects this since co-administration with these agents is not 
recommended.  
After conversion of TAF to TFV, TFV-DP is formed via intracellular phosphorylation exactly as happens after 
dosing with TDF. This hypothesis fits with the fact that <2% of an oral radioactive dose appeared in urine as 
intact TAF with none in faeces whereas TFV accounted for the majority of the radioactive dose recovered 
from urine and faeces. Although TAF accounted for most of the plasma radioactivity in the first few hours, 
most of the radioactivity in plasma (74%) was associated with uric acid over 96 h post-dose. After conversion 
to TFV it is proposed that metabolism proceeds via the purine catabolic pathway. This includes formation of 
uric acid. Since uric acid levels in pooled plasma increased over time and reached a maximum at 72 h, TAF 
was undetectable by the 6-h time point, indicating that the depurination reaction proceeded even after TAF 
was depleted from plasma. The applicant considered that in theory complete inhibition of the depurination 
pathway could result in increase of plasma TFV levels up to 4-fold. Even under these conditions, the plasma 
TFV levels would be lower than those after administration of TDF (300 mg). Since the depurination reaction is 
likely to occur after TAF is converted to TFV, potential induction of this pathway should not affect the TAF 
levels and, therefore, not affect efficacy which is mainly delivered by intact TAF. On this basis the applicant 
concluded that clinically important DDIs associated with the depurination pathway are unlikely. 
However, allopurinol and febuxostat inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that is responsible for the 
successive oxidation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, resulting in the production of uric acid. Therefore they 
decrease uric acid formation and may also inhibit purine synthesis. The clinical data do not point to clear 
increases in plasma uric acid or cases of gout but the potential for this to occur cannot be dismissed and is 
reflected in the RMP. 
Special populations 
The SmPC recommends no dose adjustment in adult patients with estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 
30 mL/min or with Class A or B hepatic impairment. Treatment should not be initiated if CrCL is < 30 mL/min 
and is not recommended in patients with Class C severe hepatic impairment due to lack of data. The advice is 
compatible with that accepted for Genvoya.

The available pharmacokinetic data from adolescents aged 12 years or more and at least 35 kg body weight 
treated with E/C/F/TAF support use of F/TAF at the same doses as recommended for adults. Further data will 
be available from study GS-US-311-1269. 
Although the POPPK analysis did not detect an effect of racial group on TAF or TFV PK that was considered 
significant the small study GS-US-292-0108 showed lower exposure to all analytes (i.e. not just TAF and 
TFV) in the Japanese group. The applicant has no mechanistic explanation for the findings but, based on the 
actual exposures observed in Japanese subjects and the lack of trends in exposure-response relationships 
observed in clinical studies with E/C/F/TAF, it does not appear likely that the differences would translate into 
lower efficacy. 
Pharmacodynamics  
The evidence to support selection of 25 mg TAF once daily in the absence of an inhibitor or inducer of P-gp 
comes from the monotherapy studies. Doses of 25 mg and 40 mg TAF achieved effects on viral load that 
were similar to those of 50 mg and 150 mg in the preliminary study, suggesting a plateau effect from ~25 
mg upwards and superiority over TDF 300 mg. It was clear that 8 mg TAF was not an appropriate dose but 
doses between 8 and 25 mg were not studied.  
The peripheral blood mononuclear cell TFV-DP concentrations were highly variable across dose groups and 
time points in the monotherapy and other studies in which data were generated. Any attempt to interpret the 
differences in TFV-DP levels within and between studies must take into account the technical challenges 
associated with the assessment of intracellular nucleotide levels, including TFV-DP in PBMCs. However, it 
seems that the consistent pattern of differences in TFV-DP concentrations between TDF and TAF treatment 
groups is most likely real. It is notable then that in the monotherapy study the intracellular PBMC 
concentrations of TFV-DP were ~ 7-fold and ~ 25-fold higher after 25 mg and 40 mg doses of TAF, 
respectively, vs. TDF. Thus there was a lack of linearity with dose. Despite this apparent difference in 
intracellular TFV-DP the 40 mg dose of TAF did not have a superior antiviral effect to 25 mg. Since the 
antiviral effect should carry more weight, the data on plasma HIV RNA from the two TAF monotherapy 
studies support a conclusion that doses lower than 25 mg should not be pursued and that increasing the dose 
beyond 25 mg is unlikely to achieve a greater antiviral effect.  
To further support the selection of the 25 mg TAF dose the applicant provided the results of Emax modelling. 
The models gave an Emax of ~1.7 to 1.8 log 10 decline in viral load from baseline. The EC50 approximated to 
a TAF AUC of ~32 ng•h/mL.  Thus, 25 mg TAF should provide near maximal activity.  
After 10 days dosing with TAF 25 mg alone the mean and median TAF AUClast values were 115 and 109 
ng.h/mL, respectively. The POPPK TAF analysis gave a mean (95% CI; % CV) predicted steady-state AUC 
from Phase 3 studies with E/C/F/TAF 10 mg in the ART-naïve of 206.4 (55.6 - 526.1; 71.8%) ng/mL*h. The 
predicted range across various subgroups was from ~170-250 ng.h/mL. On this basis, the F/TAF 10 mg 
presentation when given with a P-gp inhibitor in the fed state is predicted to give AUC values that 
comfortably exceed the EC 50 in the majority. 
The observation of higher levels of TFV-DP in PBMCs after dosing with TAF 25 mg compared to TDF 300 mg is 
not mechanistically explained. However, TAF is a more stable prodrug than TDF and it is more efficiently 
loaded into PBMCs (including lymphocytes and other HIV-target cells), although the mechanism of cell uptake 
is not known. Due to its poor cellular permeability, plasma TFV does not meaningfully contribute to 
intracellular levels of TFV-DP in patients receiving F/TAF. This is supported by the kinetic profile of TFV-DP in 
PBMCs since TFV-DP accumulates rapidly after dosing, when plasma TAF levels are still high, and are

maintained based on its long intracellular half-life. Additionally, the TAF AUC fitted well with an Emax model 
but TFV exposure did not correlate with antiviral activity.  
The slight deviation from dose proportionality in TAF and TFV plasma levels observed in the negative TQT 
study for 25 vs. 125 mg TAF over the 5-fold range tested suggests that uptake of TAF into cells and 
conversion to TFV was not easily saturable.  
There is no evidence to suggest that substitution of TDF with TAF in the FDC will increase the risk of selection 
of resistance. Also, in-vitro studies with FTC and TAF indicated no intracellular interference in formation of 
their respective phosphorylated active moieties. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
TAF is a prodrug with a distinct metabolic profile to TDF that results in > 90% lower circulating levels of TFV 
and > 4-fold higher intracellular levels of the active phosphorylated metabolite TFV-DP when TAF 25 mg is 
compared with TDF 300 mg. 
The TAF and FTC components were bioequivalent between both doses of F/TAF (200/10 mg with COBI and 
200/25 mg without COBI) and E/C/F/TAF. The demonstration of bioequivalence enables the pharmacokinetic 
bridging between the F/TAF and E/C/F/TAF FDCs.   
TAF is transported by P-gp. Therefore, drugs that induce P-gp activity may lead to a decreased plasma 
concentration of TAF, whereas drugs that inhibit P-gp increase the absorption and plasma concentration of 
TAF. Generally, F/TAF 200/25 mg is recommended with third agents that do not have clinically relevant 
effects on TAF exposure (EFV, RPV, DTG), and F/TAF 200/10 mg is recommended with third agents that 
substantially increase TAF exposure (ATV with RTV or COBI, DRV with RTV or COBI and LPV/r). 
The PK of TAF in adolescents was consistent with the range of exposures associated with antiviral activity of 
E/C/F/TAF in adults, which supports the extrapolation of efficacy data from adults to paediatric subjects aged 
at least 12 years and of at least 35 kg body weight. 
No dose adjustment of F/TAF is necessary in patients with estimated creatinine clearance greater or equal to 
30 mL/min. No dose adjustment of F/TAF is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
as no clinically relevant changes in the PK were observed in these subjects. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
There were no dose-finding studies with F/TAF since the dose of TAF was identified from the monotherapy 
study GS-120-1101, study GS-120-0104 and modelling plus the PK data indicating the need to manufacture 
two F/TAF tablets so that the TAF dose could be adjusted in accordance with the content of the total ART 
regimen, i.e. whether or not it included a P-gp inhibitor. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
There were no efficacy and safety studies conducted in treatment naïve patients with F/TAF. The anticipated 
efficacy of F/TAF is primarily based on PK bridging to the E/C/F/TAF Phase 3 studies in the ART-naïve patients

Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of E/C/F/TAF vs. STB in HIV-infected, ART naive adults 
based on HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. The details of the assay(s) used to measure HIV RNA are 
not reported but virological responses are reported at the < 50 and < 20 copies/mL level.  
A sample size of 840 patients randomised 1:1 (420 per group) was planned to achieve at least 95% power to 
assess a non-inferiority margin of 12% applied to the difference in Week 48 response rate (HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL as defined by the FDA snapshot algorithm) between 2 groups. It was assumed that each treatment 
would elicit a response rate of 0.85. The significance level was 1-sided alpha of 0.025. 
Two interim IDMC analyses were conducted prior to the primary analysis. An alpha penalty of 0.00001 was 
applied for each interim analysis so the primary efficacy hypothesis of non-inferiority of E/C/F/TAF vs. STB 
was tested with a 1-sided, 0.02499 alpha level. The Week 48 primary efficacy analysis used the FAS. The 
baseline stratum weighted difference in the response rate and its 95.002% CI were calculated based on 
stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel (MH) proportion. 
Based on planned Week 48 interim analyses conducted after all randomised patients had completed the Week 
48 study visit or had prematurely discontinued. It was planned that data would be combined across studies 
to assess efficacy, including an assessment of superiority of E/C/F/TAF over STB. After Week 96, patients will 
continue to take their blinded study drugs and attend visits every 12 weeks until treatment assignments are

unblinded, at which point all patients will return for an unblinding visit and will be given the option to 
participate in an open-label (OL) rollover study to receive E/C/F/TAF. 
Results - GS-US-292-0104  
Overall 867/872 randomised patients received a dose of study drug and 813 (E/C/F/TAF 94.9%; STB 92.6%) 
were still on treatment at the Week 48 cut-off date while 54 had discontinued study drugs (E/C/F/TAF 5.1%, 
22; STB 7.4%, 32) mainly due to withdrawal of consent (8 vs. 7). Demographic and disease characteristics 
were similar between treatments. The majority was male (85.4%), the median age was 33 years (18 to 76) 
and most were white (58.2%). Most had acquired HIV-1 via homosexual sex. The majority (93.4%) was 
asymptomatic. The baseline median eGFRCG value was slightly higher in the E/C/F/TAF group (118.5 mL/min 
vs. STB 112.8 mL/min) whilst 79 (9.1%) had dipstick proteinuria.

The median rate of adherence to study drug up to the Week 48 visit was 98.8% in both treatment groups 
and most (84.6% vs. 80.9%) had adherence rates of ≥ 95%. At Week 48 the virologic success rates were 
very high and E/C/F/TAF was non-inferior to STB. Similar findings applied in the Week 48 PP Analysis Set 
(97.8% vs. 98.0%; 95.002% CI: -2.2% to 2.1%).

HIV-1 RNA levels decreased rapidly in the first 2 weeks and were stable after Week 8 through Week 48, when 
mean decreases were E/C/F/TAF -3.24 log 10 copies/mL and STB -3.27 log 10 copies/mL.

The study was conducted at 121 sites in 10 countries. Overall 866/872 patients randomised received a dose 
of study drug and 804 (E/C/F/TAF 94.7%, STB 91.0%) were still on study drug at the Week 48 cut-off date. 
The most common reasons for premature discontinuation of study drug were LTFU (2.3% vs. 2.1%). Three 
patients died (alcohol intoxication E/C/F/TAF; alcohol and multiple drug toxicity and myocardial infarction 
STB). 
Demographic and disease baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. The majority was

Virologic outcomes at Week 48 were also similar between treatments when assessed using the FDA-defined

same for the two treatments (13.9% vs. 13.8%) and similar findings applied in the PP Analysis Set 
(E/C/F/TAF 87.7%; STB 87.2%; 95% CI: -4.7% to 4.3%). The pure virologic response rates through Week 
48 were E/C/F/TAF 93.7% vs. STB 93.1%. 
HIV-1 RNA levels decreased rapidly in the first 2 weeks on study drugs and were then stable from Week 8 
through Week 48. The mean decreases at Week 48 were E/C/F/TAF 3.19 log10 copies/mL and STB 3.14 log 10 
copies/mL.

200 cells/µL with a pattern similar to that in 0104. Similarly, using LOCF to impute missing values the mean 
increases from baseline at Week 48 were E/C/F/TAF 224 cells/µL and STB 195 cells/µL. The mean CD4% 
increased from baseline to Week 48 by E/C/F/TAF 9.1% and STB 8.7%.

Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Fixed Dose Combination in HIV-1 Infected, Antiretroviral 
Treatment-Naïve Adults 
Eligible patients were adults with: HIV-1 RNA ≥ 5,000 copies/mL at screening; no prior use of any approved 
or investigational ARV; documented viral susceptibility to DRV, FTC and TDF. Patients were randomised (1:1) 
to D/C/F/TAF (800/150/200/10 mg) or DRV 800 mg (2 x 400 mg) + COBI 150 mg + TVD (FTC 200 mg/TDF 
300 mg). Randomisation was stratified by HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100,000 vs. > 100,000 copies/mL) and race (Black 
vs. non-Black). All study drugs were to be taken once daily at about the same time and with food. After Week 
48, patients continued on blinded medications until treatment assignments were unblinded, when they were 
offered open label E/C/F/TAF.

HIV  1  RNA  plasma  concentrations  were  assessed  using  the  COBAS  AmpliPrep/COBAS  TaqMan  HIV  1  Test 
(Version  2.0).  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was the  percentage of  patients  that  achieved  HIV-1  RNA  <  50 
copies/mL at Week 24 as defined by the FDA snapshot analysis algorithm. The primary analysis assessed the 
non-inferiority  of  D/C/F/TAF  relative  DRV+COBI+TVD  using  a  conventional  95%  CI  approach,  with  a  non-
inferiority margin of 12%. The primary analysis used the FAS and a secondary analysis used the PP analysis 
set. 
The  study  was  conducted  between  in  2012  and  2014  at  40  sites  in  the  USA  and  Puerto  Rico.  Demographic 
and  general  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  between  the  treatment  groups.  The  majority  was  male 
(92.8%)  with  a  mean  age  of  35  years  (range  18  to  68  years).  All  patients  had  eGFR  (as  measured  by  CG) 
>70  mL/min  with  means  between  115-120  mL/min.  The  mean  baseline  HIV-1  RNA  value  was  4.68  log10 
copies/mL,  mean  CD4  count  was  417  cells/µL  and  mean  CD4%  was  23.7.  Overall,  80.4%  had  ≤  100,000 
copies/mL  and  5.2%  had  >  400,000  copies/mL.  The  majority  (89.5%)  was  asymptomatic,  7.2%  had 
symptomatic HIV-1 infection and 3.3% had AIDS. 
Most  (97.4  %)  had  HIV-1  subtype  B.  Six  patients  had  HIV-1  that  contained  one  DRV-specific  RAM  at 
screening,  which  did  not  adversely  influence  treatment  response.  NNRTI-associated  RAMs  were  found  in 
nearly  20%  with  the  K103N/S  mutation  being  the  most  prevalent  (10.5%)  and  9.8%  had  HIV-1  with 
nucleoside-associated RAMs, with the V118I being the most prevalent (6.5%). 
In the primary analysis the virologic outcomes at Week 24 were similar between treatments groups.

noncompliance, protocol violation, pregnancy, and study discontinued by sponsor. 
Virologic success rates in  the Week 24 PP analysis set were D/C/F/TAF 84.6% (77/91) vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 
78.7% (37/47) with a difference of 8.3% and 95% CI: -5.3% to 22.0%.

In  contrast,  the  virologic  success  rates  through  Week  48  were  lower  for  D/C/F/TAF  vs.  DRV+COBI+TVD, 
which  reflected  numbers  that  discontinued  study  drug  and  had  a  last  available  HIV-1  RNA  ≥  50  copies/mL 
(D/C/F/TAF: 8.7%, 9 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD: 4.0%, 2 subjects). Percentages with documented virologic 
failure at Week 48 were more comparable (6.8% vs. 8%).

In  the  Week  48  PP  analysis  set  the  virologic  success  rates  were  D/C/F/TAF  92.9%  (79/85)  vs. 
DRV+COBI+TVD 91.3% (42/46); difference 2.4%, 95% CI: -8.8% to 13.7%. Other approaches to analysis of 
the FAS gave generally similar results to the primary analysis and also applied to the PP sets. 
A  pure  virologic  response  (HIV-1  RNA  <  50  copies/mL  on  2  consecutive  visits)  through  Week  48  was 
observed  for  D/C/F/TAF  81.6%  (84/103)  vs.  DRV+COBI+TVD  86.0%  (43/50).  Similar  percentages  in  each 
treatment  group  did  not  achieve  confirmed  suppression  (15%  vs.  12%).  At  Week  48,  the  KM  estimates  for 
the percentages with PVF were 18% in the D/C/F/TAF group and 14% in the DRV+COBI+TVD group (overall 
p-value = 0.89). 
CD4  cell  counts  increased  for  each treatment  group  with  mean increases  through  Week  48  (observed  data) 
using the FAS of D/C/F/TAF 231 (141.9) cells/µL vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 212 (151.5) cells/µL. The CD4% also 
increased  in  each  treatment  group  with  mean  increases  from  baseline  at  Week  48  of  D/C/F/TAF  8.2%  vs. 
DRV+COBI+TVD 9.3%. 
At Week 24, the rate of virologic success by FDA-defined snapshot algorithm for subgroups according to age, 
sex, race, baseline HIV-1 RNA level, baseline CD4 cell count or study drug adherence rate was similar for the 
D/C/F/TAF and DRV+COBI+TVD. Data for Week 48 were consistent with Week 24.

Difference in response rate and its 95% CI were from baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum-adjusted MH proportion and normal approximation (except for baseline HIV-1 
RNA subgroup). 
For baseline HIV-1 RNA subgroup, difference in response rate and its 95% CI were from normal approximation.

One patient in the D/C/F/TAF arm had HIV containing a new NRTI-resistance mutation at the unblinding visit 
post Week 48 with a mutant/wild-type mixture at position K65 (K65K/R) and a mutant/wild-type mixture at 
position M184 (M184M/I), which are associated with resistance to TDF/TAF and FTC, respectively. However, 
phenotypic susceptibilities to both FTC and TDF were in the sensitive range. This patient had a prior episode 
of virologic failure at Week 40 followed by re-suppression of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL, suggesting a history 
of poor adherence. The patient has had undetectable HIV-1 RNA for >6 months while receiving E/C/F/TAF in

GS-US-311-1089 – Study Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Switch Study to Evaluate F/TAF in 
HIV-1 Positive Subjects who are Virologically Suppressed on Regimens Containing FTC/TDF 
This is an ongoing randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of switching to F/TAF vs. continuing FTC/TDF while maintaining the same third agent in virologically 
suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) patients on a stable regimen containing FTC/TDF. The primary 
efficacy endpoint was the percentage with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 (FDA snapshot algorithm). 
The distribution of third agent use by treatment groups was well balanced (Table 41). 
Table 76.  GS-US-311-1089: Baseline Third Agent (interim Week 48) 
Virologic outcomes at Week 48 were similar between treatments in the FAS and the analysis met the 
applicant’s pre-defined non-inferiority margin. Virologic failure at Week 48 occurred in 0.3% in the switch 
group vs. 1.5% in the FTC/TDF group while similar percentages had no virologic data.

The proportion of patients with HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL by prior treatment regimen with boosted PIs was 
91.6% in the F/TAF containing arm versus 92.7% in the baseline arm. The proportion of patients with HIV-

GS-US-292-0106 - Study Title: A Phase 2/3, Open-Label Study of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and 
Antiviral Activity of the Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) Single Tablet 
Regimen (STR) in HIV-1 Infected Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Adolescents 
This open-label study was conducted in ARV-naïve HIV-infected adolescents (aged 12 to < 18 years) with 
body weight  ≥ 35 kg, plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL, CD4 cell counts > 100 cells/μL and eGFR ≥ 90 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (Schwartz formula) at screening. Viruses were to be sensitive to TFV, EVG and FTC based 
on genotyping at screening. All patients received E/C/F/TAF QD with food.  
In Part A: 18 to 24 patients (at least 6 aged 12 to < 15 years and 6 aged 15 to < 18 years) were to be 
enrolled to evaluate steady-state intensive PK at Week 4. 
In Part B: The remaining patients (up to the planned total of 50 across Parts A and B) were enrolled to 
evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of E/C/F/TAF. 
Overall, 56% were female, the median age was 15 years (range 12 to 17) and patients were either black 
(88%) or Asian (12%). The median BMI at baseline was 20.0 kg/m2 and the median eGFR values calculated 
using the Schwartz and modified Schwartz formulas were 156 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 110.8 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
respectively. Pubertal stage at baseline varied widely.

The median baseline HIV-1 RNA value was 4.65 log 10 copies/mL and 20.8% had > 100,000 copies/mL. The 
median baseline CD4 cell count was 456 cells/µL and median CD4% was 23%. Sixty-four percent had 
acquired HIV through vertical transmission. The majority (83.3%) was asymptomatic.  
Mean (SD) adherence to study drug was 97.2%. Most subjects (83.7%) had an adherence rate ≥ 95%, and 
93.9% had an adherence rate ≥ 90%.

Resistance analysis of Phase 2 and Phase 3 E/C/F/TAF studies 
An integrated virology analysis was performed for patients from GS-US-292-0102 (Phase 2), GS-US-292-
0104 and GS-US-292-0111 (Phase 3) based on data to week 48. No patient excluded from the final RAP had 
viruses with emergent resistance mutations. The impact of baseline RAMs as well as subtype on treatment 
outcomes was assessed for all patients.  
Across the 3 studies that compared E/C/F/TAF with STB in ART-naive patients the baseline RAMs and HIV-1 
subtypes were comparable between treatment groups.  
•  Baseline RAMs and HIV-1 subtype had no impact on treatment outcomes. 
•  After 48 weeks of treatment the emergence of resistance mutations was rare. There were 11 patients 
with viruses that developed any treatment-emergent genotypic resistance – 4/978 (0.4%) in the 
E/C/F/TAF group and 7/925 (0.8%) in the STB group.  
• 
• 
In the E/C/F/TAF group, M184V was observed in conjunction with primary INSTI-R mutations in 4 
patients, all of whom had > 350,000 copies/mL at baseline and 3 had baseline CD4 counts <50 
cells/μL.  
The patterns of emergent resistance were similar in the E/C/F/TAF and STB groups but numerically 
lower for the E/C/F/TAF group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 137/162 
  
  
 
•  Overall, the cross-resistance profiles for the subjects with virologic failure who had emergent 
resistance to EVG, FTC, and TFV were consistent with historical data. 
During the assessment resistance data became available from the F/TAF Study GS-US-311-1089 and from 
studies of E/C/F/TAF GS-US-292-0106, 0109 and 1249. 
In the Week 48 analysis of GS-US-311-1089 3/663 (0.5%) patients met the protocol-defined virologic 
failure criteria with confirmed virologic rebound and were included in the resistance analysis population. All 
three had received FTC plus TAF or TDF with DRV/r. 
Two were from the 333 in the F/TAF+3rd Agent group and one was from the 330 in the FTC/TDF+3rd Agent 
group. One was classified as a Week 48 FDA-snapshot virologic failure on F/TAF+3rd Agent (see the efficacy 
data in the previous question) and two were classified as virologic success because they had re-suppression 
of HIV-1 RNA to < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. One of the two in the F/TAF+3rd Agent group (0.3%) 
developed M184V with reduced susceptibility to FTC at virologic failure (Week 36) and then discontinued 
study drug 36 days later. The single subject in the FTC/TDF+3rd agent group did not develop resistance to 
any regimen components. 
The Week 48 analysis of the E/C/F/TAF switch study GS-US-292-0109 described 5/1436 (0.3%) patients 
who had virologic failure with confirmed virologic rebound. Four of 959 had switched to E/C/F/TAF and one of 
477 remained on FTC/TDF+3rd Agent. One of the switched patients developed M184M/I with reduced 
susceptibility to emtricitabine at virologic failure (Week 8) and then re-suppressed with HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL by ESDD when the patient switched to a new drug regimen. The single patient in the FTC/TDF+3rd 
agent group did not develop resistance to any regimen components. 
No emergent resistance to E/C/F/TAF was detected through Week 48 in GS-US-292-0106 in adolescents. 
After 48 weeks of E/C/F/TAF in GS-US-292-1249 none of the 75 patients co-infected with HBV in the FAS 
met criteria for inclusion in the resistance analysis population. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The Phase 2 and 3 E/C/F/TAF studies vs. STB and the D/C/F/TAF study vs. DRV/co + TVD evaluated the use 
of  TAF  with  other  highly  active  agents  to  which  ART-naïve  patients’  viruses  were  known  to  be  susceptible. 
The  design  of  these  studies,  while  appropriate  for  patient  care,  cannot  provide  definitive  evidence  that  the 
TAF dose within these highly active regimens was necessarily sufficient.  
In addition, while GS-US-311-1089 has so far suggested high rates of maintenance of viral suppression, the 
efficacy data from switch studies can only be viewed as supportive. 
Therefore,  as  indicated  in  the  sections  on  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics,  the  critical  data  to 
support the TAF doses in the F/TAF FDCs come from the monotherapy studies (with doses ranging from 8 to 
150 mg), the Emax modelling and the PK data that supported adjusting the TAF dose from 25 mg to 10 mg 
depending on the content of the regimen.  
Regarding  use  of  F/TAF  10  mg  with  DRV/r  and  DRV/c,  the  only  PK  and  efficacy  data  concern  use  of  F/TAF 
with  800  mg  DRV  once  daily  when  dosing  DRV/co  within  the  candidate  FTC  presentation.  Nevertheless,  in 
terms of PK interaction, it seems likely that multiple dosing with DRV 400 mg BID to steady state would likely 
exert  the  same  impact  on  TAF  as  DRV  800  mg  QD.  The  results  cannot  be  dismissed  on  grounds  that  the 
differences between treatments reflect discontinuation rates and missing data rather than documented failure

rates. In addition, this study was not intended to provide definitive evidence of the efficacy of the test STR. 
In this small study with 2:1 randomisation it is difficult to interpret the subgroup analyses.  
In  conclusion,  this  study,  in  which  the  virologic  suppression  rates  were  unusually  low  for  an  ART-naïve 
population,  cannot  per  se  support  the  sufficiency  of  F/TAF  10  mg  when  co-administered  with  DRV/r  or 
DRV/co and it is not possible to dismiss potential concerns regarding the Week 48 data. The additional data 
from the subgroup in  GS-US-311-1089 that received F/TAF 10 mg with DRV/r cannot address this concern. 
However,  it is  difficult  to  justify  precluding the  use of  F/TAF  with  boosted  DRV  and,  as  discussed  under  PK, 
this use is considered acceptable with the reporting of the data < 20 c/mL in section 5.1 and cross-referring 
from section 4.2. 
The  Applicant  committed  to  submit  the  96-week  results  of  studies  GS-US-311-1089  and  GS-US-366-1216, 
which should include a detailed analysis of all patients who fail to maintain suppression <20 cp/mL. 
The concern regarding the adequacy of F/TAF-containing regimens to prevent HIV-1-related CNS disorders is 
discussed in full under PK. Thus far the virological resistance data do not point to any major concerns.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of F/TAF 10 mg given with a P-gp inhibitor such as COBI was demonstrated in the Phase 3 
studies of E/C/F/TAF vs. STB in which very high percentages achieved < 50 and < 20 copies/mL at Week 48 
using the FDA snapshot algorithm. Supportive evidence of efficacy comes from the Phase 2 study that 
compared D/C/F/TAF 10 mg with D/C/F/TDF and from the E/C/F/TAF and F/TAF switch studies in which TAF-
containing regimens have maintained viral suppression with no excess of rebound compared to patients who 
stayed on their TDF-containing regimens. The critical data to support the dose recommendations for F/TAF 
come from the monotherapy studies (with TAF doses ranging from 8 to 150 mg), the Emax modelling and the 
PK data on use of F/TAF 10 mg or 25 mg with various potentially interacting antiretroviral agents. These data 
supported a standard TAF dose of 25 mg and generally supported a reduction from 25 mg to 10 mg when 
TAF is given with a strong P-gp inhibitor, such as COBI or RTV. 
The data in adolescents are currently limited and confined to use of E/C/F/TAF but the PK data support use of 
the adult dose. Since E/C/F/TAF has been accepted for use in adolescents there is no reason to object to use 
of F/TAF. Nevertheless, the RMP reflects the paucity of data and the need to obtain more experience in this 
population. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The comparisons between TAF and TDF facilitated by the E/C/F/TAF studies are important and highly relevant 
to assessing the safety profile that can be expected from F/TAF. These data were assessed during the review 
of Genvoya. A Safety Update from ongoing and recently reported studies was provided during the review of 
F/TAF. Essentially this did not indicate any new concerns.  
This section discusses the new safety data from the Phase 2 study with E/C/F/TAF GS-US-299-010, the 
safety data from the switch study GS-US-311-1089 (which not only compared TAF with TDF but also TAF 10 
mg and 25 mg in conjunction with a range of third agents) and data from the E/C/F/TAF study in adolescents 
(GS-US-292-0106).

In GS-US-299-0102 the median (Q1, Q3) duration of exposure was similar between treatments (D/C/F/TAF 
68.0 [65.4, 72.7] weeks; DRV+COBI+TVD 69.1 [66.0, 73.6] weeks). The majority (>75%) in each treatment 
group received study drug for ≥ 60 weeks. 
Almost patients reported at least one AE in both treatment groups. The most commonly reported were:  
•  D/C/F/TAF - diarrhoea (21.4%, 22); URTI (15.5%, 16); fatigue (13.6%, 14); nausea (12.6%, 13); 
rash (11.7%, 12). Arthralgia was reported for 8.7% in the D/C/F/TAF group compared with none in 
the DRV+COBI+TVD group.  
•  DRV+COBI+TVD - diarrhoea (26.0%, 13); fatigue (18.0%, 9); URTI (14.0%, 7); flatulence (12.0%, 
6);  and nausea, vomiting, pain in extremity, vitamin D deficiency each in 10.0% (5)

(Safety Analysis Set 
Similar percentages in each group had any Grade 3 AEs and no Grade 4 AEs were reported. Grade 3 AEs 
included a E/C/F/TAF patient with a SAE of Grade 3 hypersensitivity and non-serious AE of Grade 3 rash, 
which resulted in study drug discontinuation. AEs considered by the investigator to be related to study drug 
were reported for E/C/F/TAF 41.7% (43) and DRV+COBI+TVD 38.0% (19). The most common were 
diarrhoea (13.6% vs. 14.0%), flatulence (3.9% vs. 10.0%), nausea (9.7% vs. 6.0%) and fatigue (8.7% vs. 
8.0%).

A higher percentage of patients experienced AEs of arthralgia in the D/C/F/TAF group (8.7%, 9/103 patients 
with 10 AEs) compared with none of 50 patients in the DRV+COBI+TVD group. 
Of the 10 arthralgia AEs, 8 were Grade 1 and 2 were Grade 2 while none was serious or led to 
discontinuation. Two both Grade 1 AEs were related to study drug as assessed by the investigator. Seven 
resolved with continued treatment with study drug. No consistent manifestation of arthralgia was identified in 
terms of unilateral vs. bilateral or joint distributions and there were no trends with respect to time to onset 
(range Day 3 to 480; median Day 106.5). The distribution by gender and age reflected the overall study 
population. One had a medical history of osteoarthritis in the left ankle reported as ongoing. Concurrent self-
limited systemic or gastrointestinal symptoms were reported by two patients (one had concurrent vomiting, 
nausea and fatigue) and one had bloody diarrhoea, loose stool and cough.  
No selected fracture AEs were reported during this study. Decreases from baseline in BMD at the hip or spine 
were smaller in the D/C/F/TAF group compared with the DRV+COBI+TVD group. The differences in the 
categorical distribution of percentage change from baseline in hip or spine BMD were statistically significant 
(p ≤ 0.002 for both at Weeks 24 and 48). 
At Week 48 there was a > 3% decrease from baseline in hip BMD in E/C/F/TAF 18.3% vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 
61.7% and in spine BMD in 32.5% vs. 55.3%. The distribution of the clinical BMD status adjusted for baseline 
status was significantly different between treatment groups at Week 48 at the hip and at Weeks 24 and 48 at 
the spine. Few patients in either group had worsening hip or spine BMD clinical status at Week 48 (hip 2 vs. 7 
and spine 6 vs. 10).  
No case of PRT occurred in the E/C/F/TAF group. Two patients in the E/C/F/TAF group had increased serum 
creatinine that was reported as an AE. 
There were no AEs of uveitis during the study. AEs in the eye disorders SOC were reported for 5.8% (n = 6) 
in the D/C/F/TAF group and none in DRV+COBI+TVD group. One AE of photophobia was considered to be 
drug-related but did not result in discontinuation and resolved on the same day without treatment. 
Patient exposure 
Adverse events 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There have been no deaths in the additional studies in the F/TAF development programme. 
In GS-US-299-0102 SAEs were reported in 5 D/C/F/TAF (4.9%) and 2 DRV+COBI+TVD (4.0%) patients. One 
SAE was considered related to study drug in the D/C/F/TAF group (the case of Grade 3 hypersensitivity on 
day 1 and Grade 3 rash starting on day 8 above). Both events resolved on day 16. 
Discontinuations due to adverse events 
In GS-US-299-0102 two patients in each treatment group (D/C/F/TAF 1.9%; DRV+COBI+TVD 4.0%) 
discontinued from the study due to AEs: 
One in the D/C/F/TAF group had a SAE of hypersensitivity and a non-serious AE of rash (see above) 
One in the D/C/F/TAF group had a SAE of substance abuse

One in the DRV+COBI+TVD group had a SAE of Grade 2 renal tubular disorder (reported as PRT) 
One in the DRV+COBI+TVD group had an AE of Grade 3 worsening of diarrhoea 
In GS-US-311-1386 one subject discontinued due to neutropenia. 
In GS-US-311-1342 one subject discontinued due to Grade 2 macular rash. 
Laboratory findings 
Renal laboratory parameters 
In GS-US-299-0102 increases from baseline in mean values for serum creatinine occurred in both groups but 
were smaller at weeks 24 and 48 in the D/C/F/TAF group. Note that the actual changes were small in both 
groups (e.g. increases from baseline at Week 48 were D/C/F/TAF 0.06 mg/dL vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 0.09 
mg/dL [p = 0.053]). 
Decreases from baseline in median eGFRCG occurred in both groups but were smaller in the D/C/F/TAF 
group. For example, at Week 48 the median changes from baseline were D/C/F/TAF -2.9 mL/min vs. 
DRV+COBI+TVD -10.6 mL/min (p = 0.017). The changes from baseline in eGFRCKD-EPI, creatinine and 
eGFRCKD-EPI, cysC all followed the observations for eGFRCG.

Proteinuria was reported for 32.4% in the D/C/F/TAF group and 34.0% in the DRV+COBI+TVD group.  Most 
proteinuria by dipstick was Grade 1 or 2; one in the DRV+COBI+TVD group had Grade 3. There were

numerical but not statistically significant differences between treatment groups in median percentage change 
from baseline in UPCR or UACR (UPCR: D/C/F/TAF -8.22% vs. DRV+COBI+TVD -27.52%; UACR -13.1% vs. -
22.6%). 
The median percent increase from baseline at Week 48 in RBP to creatinine ratio was D/C/F/TAF 9% vs. 
DRV+COBI+TVD 54% (p = 0.003) whereas the median percent change from baseline at Week 48 in beta-2-
microglobulin to creatinine ratio was -42.0% vs. 2.3% (p = 0.002), respectively. 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in median values for the other renal biomarkers in 
either group (FEPO4 and FEUA using serum creatinine adjusted or unadjusted values) and no statistically 
significant differences between groups. 
Other laboratory parameters 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline within groups or differences between the treatment 
groups in median values for haematology or chemistry parameters and median values were within normal 
ranges except for lipase, which was measured only for subjects with elevated amylase. 
Nevertheless, the majority had at least laboratory abnormality (D/C/F/TAF 96.1% vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 
94.0%) including Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in 27.5% vs. 28.0%. The most commonly reported 
Grade 3 or 4 abnormality was creatine kinase (D/C/F/TAF 8.8%; DRV+COBI+TVD 12.0%). No patients had 
elevations > 3 × ULN in AST or ALT, in addition to total bilirubin > 2 × ULN and ALP < 1.5 × ULN. 
There were increases from baseline in fasting total cholesterol, fasting direct LDL cholesterol, fasting HDL 
cholesterol and fasting triglycerides at Weeks 24 and 48 for both treatments except that there was a 
decrease in fasting triglycerides at Week 48 in the DRV+COBI+TVD group. The median increases from 
baseline were for D/C/F/TAF at Week 24 and Week 48, with significant differences in fasting total cholesterol 
and fasting direct LDL cholesterol at Week 24 and for all four parameters at Week 48. 
Graded fasting hypercholesterolemia was more common in the D/C/F/TAF group (57.6% vs. 36.7%). Graded 
abnormalities in fasting LDL occurred in 53.5% vs. 34.7%, with Grade 2 in 19.2% vs. 10.2% but Grade 3 in 
5.1% vs. 8.2%. Similar percentages received lipid-modifying agents (14.6% vs. 14.0%). 
Safety in special populations 
GS-US-292-0106 Adolescents treated with E/C/F/TAF 
At the time of the Week 24 interim analysis 39/48 subjects (81.3%) had at least 1 AE. Very common AEs 
included nausea (22.9%, 11 subjects), upper respiratory tract infection (20.8%, 10 subjects), diarrhoea 
(16.7%, 8 subjects), abdominal pain, headache, respiratory tract infection (each 14.6%, 7 subjects), 
vomiting (12.5%, 6 subjects) and dizziness, vitamin D deficiency (both 10.4%, 5 subjects). Four subjects 
(8.3%) had a Grade 3 or 4 AE including Grade 3 neuralgia, Grade 3 bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, mania 
and substance abuse, Grade 3 chorioretinitis and Grade 4 suicide attempt. Eighteen subjects (37.5%) had an 
AE considered related to study drug by the investigator, most of which were gastrointestinal or nervous 
system disorders. 
Grade 2 visual impairment, Grade 3 chorioretinitis and Grade 2 intermediate uveitis that were considered 
drug-related by the investigator were reported for one subject. This case of potential uveitis was one of the 
four SAEs reported and the only one considered drug-related. The patient responded to treatment and did

not discontinue study drug. One renal SAE was reported, which was Grade 2 urinary retention in a 17-year-
old black male with a prior history of urinary retention. 
An updated report was provided. At that time enrolment was complete and 50 subjects had received 
E/C/F/TAF for at least 8 weeks while 25 had received 48 weeks. The median (Q1, Q3) duration of exposure to 
E/C/F/TAF was 48.0 (40.1, 72.1) weeks. Data reflected 2650 subject-weeks of exposure (vs. 922 subject-
weeks in the original submission). At the time of the data cut 48 subjects were continuing study drug (25 
main phase and 23 in the extension phase). Two had prematurely discontinued study drug and from the 
study (withdrew consent and lost to follow up). 
At least 1 AE was reported for 84.0% (42/50), most of which were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Four subjects 
(8.0%) had a Grade 3 or 4 AE. The most common AEs were nausea, URTI and respiratory tract infection 
(each reported in 24.0%; 12). Eighteen (36.0%) had an AE considered related to study drug by the 
investigator, most of which were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity and most commonly nausea, abdominal pain, 
vomiting, upper abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Four subjects (8.0%) had a SAE but except for the previously 
reported case of visual impairment and intermediate uveitis these were not considered related to study drug 
by the investigator. No subject had an AE that led to study drug discontinuation and there were no deaths.  
An additional event of potential uveitis occurred in a subject who used illicit substances prior to sleeping and 
then awoke with blurred vision and photophobia. He presented to the ED the same day, where the vision 
changes were attributed to migraine headaches. The subject denied any previous history of migraine 
headaches. The visual changes resolved later that same night and have not been reported since. The 
investigator assessed this event as moderate, non-serious, and not related to E/C/F/TAF, with a possible 
alternative aetiology of substance abuse. The subject remains virologically suppressed on E/C/F/TAF.  
One pregnancy occurred. The subject underwent an abortion and then resumed treatment with E/C/F/TAF. 
The median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in serum creatinine was 0.06 (0.00, 0.12) mg/dL at Week 1 
(baseline median [Q1, Q3], 0.58 [0.50, 0.79] mg/dL). Creatinine subsequently stabilised without progressive 
changes with a median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline at Week 24 of 0.08 (0.00, 0.15) mg/dL. No graded 
abnormalities of serum creatinine were reported. 
The median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in eGFR (calculated using the Schwartz formula) at Week 1 was -
13.0 (-26.0, 0.0) mL/min/1.73 m2 (baseline median [Q1, Q3], 156.0 [129.0, 185.0] mL/min/1.73 m2). The 
median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline at Week 24 was -15.0 (-30.0, 0.0) mL/min/1.73 m2. No AEs 
concerning decreases in eGFR or of renal failure were reported. 
Post-baseline, treatment-emergent Grade 1 or Grade 2 proteinuria, generally isolated and transient, was 
reported for 36.0% (18/50). Proteinuria was not reported as an AE for any subject. There were no SAEs of 
proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi Syndrome) and no subject had laboratory findings consistent 
with proximal renal tubulopathy. 
Although limited data are available through Week 48, renal safety results at Week 48 were generally similar 
to Week 24. At Week 24, 3/47 subjects (6.4%) had a ≥ 4% decrease in spine BMD but none had a ≥ 4% 
decrease in TBLH BMD.

Because the study population was shorter than the general population at the same age (median Z-scores for 
height at baseline and Week 24 were -0.75 and -0.72, respectively), adjustment of BMD Z-scores is 
considered critical for interpretation of the adolescent data. Baseline height-age adjusted spine and TBLH 
BMD Z-scores were higher than standard Z-scores (consistent with the below average height of the study 
population). Changes from baseline in spine and TBLH height-age adjusted BMD Z-scores at Weeks 24 and 
48 are shown in Table 82.

Most (96%, 48/50) had at least 1 treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality reported, most of which were 
Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Excluding Grade 3 haematuria detected by non-quantitative dipstick analysis, Grade 
3 laboratory abnormalities were reported for 4 subjects. Isolated abnormalities of grade 3 decreased 
neutrophils were reported for 3 subjects. One subject had transient Grade 3 haematuria following 
quantitative analysis. None of these laboratory abnormalities was reported as an AE. 
Comparison of F/TAF vs. F/TDF and F/TAF 10 mg vs. 25 mg 
During the procedure the Week 48 CSR for the switch study GS-US-311-1089 (F/TAF 333 vs. FTC/TDF 330) 
was provided. The F/TAF group included 155 dosed with TAF 10 mg and 178 dosed with TAF 25 mg. This 
study is currently the only one with comparative safety data F/TAF vs. F/TDF when used with a range of third 
agents and also the only study that provides comparative safety data for the TAF 10 mg and 25 mg doses.  
TAF vs. TDF

a Treatment-emergent death refers to a death occurring between the first dose date and the last dose date plus 30 days (inclusive). 
Safety conclusions for the comparisons between patients treated with TAF vs. those treated with TDF through 
48 weeks (median 48.2 and 48.3 weeks) in this study were consistent with those in the studies of E/C/F/TAF 
vs. Stribild, as follows: 
o  There were low rates of SAEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 147/162 
  
  
 
o  Renal laboratory parameters improved upon switching to F/TAF from FTC/TDF 
o  Spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) improved upon switching to F/TAF from FTC/TDF 
o  Greater increases from baseline in fasting total cholesterol, fasting LDL cholesterol and fasting 
triglycerides were observed in the F/TAF group. 
The most common AEs by treatment group were: 
o  F/TAF+3rd Agent: diarrhoea and URTI (9.0%, 30 patients each) and headache (8.1%, 27 patients) 
o  FTC/TDF+3rd Agent: URTI (13.6%, 45), diarrhoea (10.0%, 33) and sinusitis (6.7%, 22). 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported for 5.1% TAF and 3.6% TDF patients but none was considered drug-related 
by investigators. 
AEs considered drug-related by investigators were reported for 9.3% TAF and 12.1% TDF patients of which 
nausea and diarrhoea were the most frequent in both treatment groups.  
One and two patients per treatment group had fractures but all were the result of trauma and considered by 
the investigator as unrelated to the study drugs. There were increases from baseline in mean (SD) BMD at 
the hip and at the spine in the F/TAF+3rd Agent group compared with minimal changes from baseline in both 
parameters in the FTC/TDF+3rd Agent group (p < 0.001 at Weeks 24 and 48). 
Differences between groups in the categorical distribution of percentage change from baseline in hip or spine 
BMD were also statistically significant (p < 0.001 at Weeks 24 and 48). At Week 48, more patients in the 
F/TAF+3rd Agent group had a ≥  3% increase from baseline in hip (16.7% vs. FTC/TDF+3rd Agent 8.6%) or 
spine BMD (30.3% vs. 13.7%) and there was a decrease in bone turnover after switching to F/TAF from 
FTC/TDF.

In the F/TAF+3rd Agent group, no patient had renal AEs that were serious, resulted in discontinuation of 
study drug or were considered by the investigator as related to study drug. One patient in the FTC/TDF+3rd 
Agent group had a SAE of nephrolithiasis considered related to study drug and one had a non-serious renal 
AE of creatinine increased considered related and leading to study drug discontinuation. There were no AEs of 
proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi Syndrome) reported. 
In the switched group there were decreases from baseline in serum creatinine at most time points as 
compared with minimal changes from baseline with FTC/TDF+3rd Agent. At Week 48, the mean (SD) 
changes from baseline in serum creatinine were F/TAF+3rd Agent –0.08 [0.238] mg/dL vs. FTC/TDF+3rd 
Agent –0.04 [0.126] mg/dL (p = 0.005). There were increases from baseline in eGFRCG in the F/TAF+3rd 
Agent group vs. minimal changes in the FTC/TDF+3rd Agent group at Weeks 4 through 48.

a P-values comparing the 2 treatment groups were from the 2-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
For postbaseline visits, p-values were from rank analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline value and the third agent randomization stratum for treatment 
comparison. 
At Week 24, there was improvement in proteinuria in the F/TAF+3rd Agent group. There were decreases 
from baseline in urine protein to creatinine ratio, urine albumin to creatinine ratio, and in urine retinol binding 
protein to creatinine and beta-2-microglobulin to creatinine ratios in the F/TAF+3rd Agent group compared 
with increases from baseline in the FTC/TDF+3rd Agent group in all of these parameters at Week 48 (p < 
0.001 for the differences between groups). 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline within groups, or differences between the treatment 
groups in median values for haematology or clinical chemistry parameters. With the exception of lipase, 
which was measured only for subjects with elevated amylase, all median values were within normal ranges. 
Patients taking ATV/r showed the expected effects on bilirubin. 
There were increases from baseline in fasting values of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in 
the F/TAF+3rd Agent group vs. little change in the FTC/TDF+3rd Agent group at both Week 24 and Week 48 
(p < 0.001 for the differences between groups for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol; p = 0.016 at Week 
24 and p = 0.002 at Week 48 for triglycerides). There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in 
the total cholesterol to HDL ratio in either treatment group. 
One patient in the F/TAF+3rd Agent group died during the study as a result of lymphoma and increased 
lipase; these events were considered by the investigator as not related to study drug. One patient in the 
F/TAF+3rd Agent group had a confirmed pregnancy. 
No AE that led to study drug discontinuation was reported for more than 1 patient in either group. Four 
patients in F/TAF+3rd Agent group (including the patient who died) and 3 subjects in the FTC/TDF+3rd Agent 
group had study-drug related AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. 
F/TAF 10 mg vs. F/TAF 25 mg 
The comparison of safety between subgroups that received F/TAF 10 mg and F/TAF 25 mg should be treated 
with caution since patients were not randomised in this regard and the data are confounded by the use of a 
PI vs. no PI. Nevertheless, the data by TAF dose suggest similar safety profiles. The only AE that had ≥ 5% 
difference between TAF dose groups was diarrhoea (TAF 10 mg 12.3%; TAF 25 mg 6.2%). This could have 
been driven by the association of PI/r with diarrhoea.  
Assessment report

When compared with TDF, the incidence of diarrhoea was similar for those on a PI/r (F/TAF 12.3% vs. 
FTC/TDF 10.6%) and for those not on a PI/r (F/TAF 6.2% vs. FTC/TDF 9.5%). No other notable differences 
were observed in the percentages with specific AEs when comparing TAF dose groups. 
At Week 48 there were improvements from baseline in mean (SD) BMD at the hip and at the spine that were 
similar between TAF dose groups and there were decreases from baseline in mean (SD) serum creatinine and 
increases in median eGFRCG values that were similar between TAF dose groups. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the E/C/F/TAF Phase 2/3 studies there were direct comparisons of safety with STB in previously untreated 
patients and assessments of safety after switching from TDF to TAF within regimens. The AE profile of 
E/C/F/TAF was mostly very similar to that of STB. Overall the data suggested benefits in terms of renal and 
bone effects for TAF vs. TDF, which was apparent in prospective comparisons as well as post-switching. 
Detailed assessment of renal function in patients with eGFRCG 30-69 mL/min supported no adjustment of the 
FTC dose when CrCL is ≥30 mL/min. Thus far there have not been any cases of PRT or Fanconi’s syndrome 
with TAF.  
Current data, including updates provided during the review of E/C/F/TAF, do not suggest that the nonclinical 
findings translate into a concern regarding the ocular safety of TAF. There was one adolescent with uveitis 
considered to be drug-related by the investigator. This potential risk is reflected in the RMP. 
In previously ART-naïve patients E/C/F/TAF was associated with higher rates of abnormal fasting lipids, 
including Grade 3 and 4 abnormalities, than STB. The differences between TAF and TDF-containing regimens 
are thought to mainly reflect the known lipid lowering effect of TFV and the loss of this effect due to the much 
lower plasma levels of TFV in those given E/C/F/TAF vs. STB. Also, based on the finding that median changes 
from baseline decreased in renally impaired patients in 0112 who switched to E/C/F/TAF from a non TDF 
containing regimen the applicant suggests that the effect on lipids was not due to TAF per se. Furthermore, 
the lipid changes after initiation of E/C/F/TAF are in line with those observed with several other ART regimens 
that do not contain TDF. There is no indication that there are excessive changes when initiating E/C/F/TAF. 
Taking into account the metabolic pathway, there was no excess of Grade 3 or 4 hyperuricaemia with 
E/C/F/TAF in the ART-naïve Phase 3 studies and only a slightly higher rate of hyperuricaemia of any Grade 
(13.8% vs. 10.9% in 0104 and 0.5% vs. 0.2% in 0111). For mean and median uric acid these studies both 
showed that there was effectively no change from baseline to Week 48 in the E/C/F/TAF group and a small 
decrease in the STB group. AEs that could be due to hyperuricaemia were not observed.  
The new safety data from the Phase 2 study that compared D/C/F/TAF with DRV/co + TVD are very much in 
keeping with those observed in E/C/F/TAF vs. STB studies, the only difference in the regimen being use of 
TAF instead of TDF. This was a small study with 2:1 randomisation so that it is difficult to place too much 
stress on differences in rates for individual AEs between treatments. However, the rate of arthralgia (9 TAF 
vs. no TDF patients) stands out. In this relatively small Phase 2 study with 2:1 randomisation in which the 
only difference between regimens was TAF vs. TDF, the imbalance in reports of arthralgia was notable but the 
details of these cases do not reveal any pattern suggesting a very clear relationship to TAF. Nevertheless, in 
the E/C/F/TAF studies arthralgia was reported by 7% on E/C/F/TAF vs. 4.5% on Stribild and in the 
uncontrolled study GS-US-292-0112 in patients with renal impairment 20/242 (8.3%) reported arthralgia. 
Arthralgia was not included in the ADRs in the Genvoya SmPC (which did not include the D/C/F/TAF study), 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 151/162 
  
  
 
however it is included in the F/TAF SmPC as an uncommon ADR (based on overall rates across studies).There 
were no new concerns raised after review of the Safety Update.  
In light of the unexplained differential effects on the plasma exposures to TAF and TFV that have been 
observed in several studies the safety data from GS-US-311-1089 are important to support a conclusion that 
F/TAF when administered with a range of agents provides a similar profile and apparent benefits on renal and 
bone safety as observed in the E/C/F/TAF vs. Stribild studies. 
Overall the safety data do support this conclusion. In addition, the limited comparison that can be made 
between TAF dose groups indicates that the differential effects vs. TDF apply regardless of use of F/TAF 10 
mg or 25 mg depending on the third agent (even though the DDI data indicate that TFV exposures are likely 
higher with the former than the latter due to co-administered agents) but it should be noted that the study 
was not designed to support definitive conclusions in this respect. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The Phase 3 studies with E/C/F/TAF 10 mg vs. STB in ART-naïve patients, the Phase 2 study with D/C/F/TAF 
vs. D/C F/TDF and the switch studies, including GS-US-311-1089 (in which F/TAF or F/TADF were each given 
with a range of third agents in the ART regimen) all pointed to benefits for TAF over TDF in terms of effects 
on hip or spine BMD. The renal safety profile of TAF also appears to be better than that of TDF in patients 
previously naïve to ART and in those who switched from TDF to TAF. Additionally, detailed assessments of 
renal function in the E/C/F/TAF study in patients with baseline eGFRCG in the range 30-69 mL/min support a 
conclusion that F/TAF has an acceptable renal safety profile in patients in the 30-50 mL/min range. These 
data also support use of FTC without dose adjustment in patients with CrCL ≥ 30 mL/min. 
In comparative studies in ART-naïve patients the AE profile of E/C/F/TAF was mostly very similar to that of 
STB while that of D/C/F/TAF was similar to that of DRV/co + TVD. In ART-naïve patients both E/C/F/TAF and 
D/C/F/TAF were associated with higher rates of abnormal fasting lipids, including Grade 3 and 4 
abnormalities, than TDF-containing comparative regimens. Similarly, higher rates of abnormal fasting lipids 
were observed in those who switched to TAF vs. those who maintained a TDF-containing regimen. The 
difference between TAF and TDF-containing regimens likely reflects the known lipid lowering effect of TFV, 
which is reduced in line with the much lower plasma levels of TFV in those given E/C/F/TAF. In conclusion, 
the effect of TAF-containing regimens on lipids resembles that of other commonly used ART regimens without 
TDF and the benefits of TAF vs. TDF in terms of renal and bone effects appear to outweigh any concerns 
there may be regarding the lipid profile.  
An imbalance in cases of arthralgia was observed suggesting to be an ADR.  
The available data in adolescents suggest a benign safety profile. Since E/C/F/TAF has been accepted for use 
in adolescents there is no reason to object to use of F/TAF. Nevertheless, the RMP reflects the paucity of data 
and the need to obtain more experience in this population. 
Finally, current data do not suggest that the nonclinical findings translate into a concern regarding the ocular 
safety of TAF. However, this issue will be monitored in the RMP.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Stribild and Genvoya. The bridging report submitted by the applicant 
has been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Descovy (Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was 
not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
TAF was selected for development specifically because it had potential to be active with much lower TFV 
plasma levels and hence improved safety vs. TDF. Thus, selection of the TAF dose could not be based on the 
simple strategy of matching plasma profiles of TFV achieved with TAF vs. those observed with TDF.  
The efficacy of F/TAF 10 mg given with a P-gp inhibitor such as COBI was demonstrated in the Phase 3 
studies of E/C/F/TAF vs. STB in which very high percentages achieved < 50 and < 20 copies/mL at Week 48 
using the FDA snapshot algorithm. Supportive evidence of efficacy comes from the Phase 2 study that 
compared D/C/F/TAF 10 mg with D/C/F/TDF and from the E/C/F/TAF and F/TAF switch studies in which TAF-
Assessment report

Page 156/162 
  
  
 
containing regimens have maintained viral suppression with no excess of rebound compared to patients who 
stayed on their TDF-containing regimens. 
The Phase 3 studies with E/C/F/TAF 10 mg vs. STB in ART-naïve patients, the Phase 2 study with D/C/F/TAF 
vs. D/C F/TDF and the switch studies, including GS-US-311-1089 (in which F/TAF or F/TADF were each given 
with a range of third agents in the ART regimen) all pointed to benefits for TAF over TDF in terms of effects 
on hip or spine BMD. The renal safety profile of TAF also appears to be better than that of TDF in patients 
previously naïve to ART and in those who switched from TDF to TAF. Additionally, detailed assessments of 
renal function in the E/C/F/TAF study in patients with baseline eGFRCG in the range 30-69 mL/min support a 
conclusion that F/TAF has an acceptable renal safety profile in patients in the 30-50 mL/min range. These 
data also support use of FTC without dose adjustment in patients with CrCL ≥ 30 mL/min. 
The data in adolescents are currently limited and confined to use of E/C/F/TAF but the PK data support use of 
the adult dose and available data suggest a benign safety profile. Since E/C/F/TAF has been accepted for use 
in adolescents there is no reason to object to use of F/TAF. Nevertheless, the RMP reflects the paucity of data 
and the need to obtain more experience in this population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Although the Phase 3 E/C/F/TAF studies gave very high response rates they are not sensitive to confirm the 
adequacy of the 10 mg TAF dose when used with COBI due to the major antiviral effects of the other agents 
in the regimen. Additional efficacy data from the Phase 2 D/C/F/TAF study and the switch studies can only be 
viewed as supportive. Therefore, the critical data to support the dose recommendations for F/TAF come from 
the monotherapy studies (with TAF doses ranging from 8 to 150 mg), the Emax modelling and the PK data on 
use of F/TAF 10 mg or 25 mg with various potentially interacting antiretroviral agents. These data supported 
a standard TAF dose of 25 mg and generally supported a reduction from 25 mg to 10 mg when TAF is given 
with a strong P-gp inhibitor, such as COBI or RTV.  
However, GS-US-292-103 showed that although plasma TAF was very slightly lower on dosing with Genvoya 
compared with F/TAF 25 mg, the plasma TFV AUC was lower after dosing with F/TAF 25 mg vs. Genvoya. 
This finding, which remains mechanistically unexplained, suggested an effect of COBI on the compartmental 
disposition of TFV.  
The finding raised a question regarding the basis for extrapolation of efficacy from Genvoya to F/TAF 
regardless of the third agent co-administered and whether or not the regimen included P-gp inhibitors COBI 
or RTV. It also raised a question regarding the CNS levels of TFV-DP that may be achieved with F/TAF, and, 
hence, the efficacy of various TAF-containing regimens against HIV within the CNS.  
The applicant responded to these concerns during the procedure and the questions were referred to the 
Virology SAG. When considering these issues the following observations have some relevance. 
To ascribe the difference in TFV plasma levels that was observed when TAF was administered with or without 
COBI to a differential effect on the whole body distribution of TFV would require that systemic concentrations 
of COBI are sufficient to exert effects on relevant transporters outside of the gut.  
In vitro, COBI inhibits the transporters P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MRP-2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Its effect on 
plasma exposures to substrates of P-gp and/or BCRP via inhibition at the gut level is clear. However, in the 
context of explaining effects on plasma TFV levels after oral administration of TAF, it should be noted that 
TFV is not a substrate for P-gp, MRP2 or BCRP and its renal elimination should not be affected by COBI based 
on the calculated Cmax,u/IC50 ratios. Regarding the potential for systemic effects on other transporters it is 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 157/162 
  
  
clear that COBI reaches sufficient concentrations to inhibit MATE1 in the kidney, with consequent effects on 
serum creatinine. However, it is not expected to reach sufficient concentrations to inhibit P-gp at the BBB and 
inhibition of BCRP and MRP4 at the BBB does not seem to have marked effects on their substrates. Overall, 
existing knowledge regarding COBI and its effects on transporters, as well as the substrate profile of TFV, do 
not explain the modest difference in TFV plasma levels observed when TAF was given with and without COBI 
to healthy subjects. There is no clear basis for concluding that the difference truly reflects different whole 
body distribution of TFV when TAF is administered with or without COBI or that dosing with and without COBI 
will affect brain parenchyma levels of the active moiety TFV-DP. 
TFV is not the active moiety but is the moiety associated with adverse renal and bone effects. Since TFV 
plasma levels were slightly lower for F/TAF 25 mg vs. TAF 10 mg given with COBI there is no reason to 
expect a worse safety profile for F/TAF when used without COBI compared to Genvoya. In addition, the 
safety data from GS-US-311-1089, in which subjects either switched to TAF or remained on TDF, each with 
FTC and a wide range of third agents (including PI/r combinations), indicated that the safety profile for TAF-
treated patients vs. TDF-treated patients was consistent with observations made in the Phase 3 Genvoya 
studies that compared Genvoya with Stribild. 
In summary, although there remains a theoretical possibility that the presence of a P-gp inhibitor as part of 
an overall TAF-containing ART regimen could affect entry of TAF into the brain and, thus, TFV-DP levels, the 
overall picture at present suggests that this is a remote possibility. CSF levels of TFV or TAF cannot be 
regarded as highly predictive of TFV-DP in the brain. There is at least a theoretical possibility that use of TAF 
rather than TDF could improve on levels of TFV-DP achieved in the CNS replicating sites.  
The general experience with the more highly effective ART regimens that have become available especially in 
the last decade support a conclusion that effective and sustained virologic suppression in plasma is 
associated with CSF virologic suppression or, at least, only asymptomatic and usually temporary detection of 
HIV-1 RNA in CSF. There no reason to think that rates of plasma virologic failure or CSF virologic failure are 
more likely to occur with regimens containing TAF vs. otherwise identical regimens containing TDF. Thus, 
F/R/TAF should exert similar activity to Eviplera when used in accordance with identical restrictions and 
warnings and there is no good reason to expect that the risk of escape HIV-1 replication in the brain is any 
greater with the former vs. the latter. 
The SAG concurred with a conclusion that F/TAF should pose no difference vs. Truvada in control over HIV 
replication in plasma and in the CNS when each is given with the same third agent.  
Regarding the nature of the third agent, the Phase 2 study that compared D/C/F/TAF 10 mg with D/C/F/TDF 
suggested numerical inferiority for the TAF vs. TDF regimen based on percentages with < 50 c/mL at week 
48 and percentages with < 20 c/mL at weeks 24 and 48. This relatively small study was not powered for 
inferential testing. The plasma TAF level was comparable with that observed with 25 mg TAF given alone and 
the intracellular TFV-DP levels were higher in the TAF vs. TDF group as observed in other studies. The 
findings of this study are currently unexplained. There is a Phase 3 study ongoing, which is not sponsored by 
the current applicant but the applicant is kept informed. It is expected that results may be reported within ~1 
year and should provide more definitive evidence on the performance of the D/C/F/TAF 10 mg regimen in 
ART-naïve patients. Meanwhile, the data from this study have been reflected in section 5.1.  
Other uncertainties regarding efficacy included concern over the adequacy of F/TAF 25 mg if it was given 
without food and without a P-gp inhibitor, use of F/TAF 25 mg with the P-gp inducer EFV and use with 
stronger inducers of P-gp, such as carbamazepine. Additionally, a concern arose regarding maintenance of 
the beneficial effects of TAF vs. TDF on safety if F/TAF 25 mg was given with a strong inhibitor of P-gp other 
Assessment report  
EMA/192941/2016 
Page 158/162 
  
  
than RTV or COBI. These various issues were further addressed during the procedure. The applicant 
addressed these various concerns based on comparisons of plasma TAF (and to some extent intracellular 
TFV-DP) across various regimens and by amendments to the SmPC.  
Ultimately it was concluded that the data support expectations that the efficacy of F/TAF 10 mg administered 
regardless of food in the presence of a P-gp inhibitor and F/TAF 25 mg administered regardless of food in the 
absence of a P-gp inhibitor should provide broadly comparable efficacy. The applicant added advice in section 
4.5 that F/TAF 10 mg should be used when it is given with non-ART potent P-gp inhibitors, including 
ciclosporin, ketoconazole and itraconazole. It was finally concluded that plasma TAF and intracellular TFV-DP 
data from the switch study GS-US-311-1089 and the Phase 2 study with D/C/F/TAF 10 mg supported use of 
F/TAF 25 mg with EFV and use of F/TAF 10 mg with DRV/co or DRV/r (with which the interaction with TAF 
seems complex). The DDI study with carbamazepine indicated a risk of inadequate TAF and hence TFV-DP 
levels if F/TAF is taken with a potent inducer of P-gp. There does not seem to be a good reason to accept 
such a risk. Therefore, it is considered that co-administration of F/TAF with potent inducers of P-gp should be 
not recommended. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In comparative studies in ART-naïve patients the AE profile of E/C/F/TAF was mostly very similar to that of 
STB while that of D/C/F/TAF was similar to that of DRV/co + TVD. In ART-naïve patients both E/C/F/TAF and 
D/C/F/TAF were associated with higher rates of abnormal fasting lipids, including Grade 3 and 4 
abnormalities, than TDF-containing comparative regimens. Similarly, higher rates of abnormal fasting lipids 
were observed in those who switched to TAF vs. those who maintained a TDF-containing regimen. The 
difference between TAF and TDF-containing regimens likely reflects the known lipid lowering effect of TFV, 
which is reduced in line with the much lower plasma levels of TFV in those given E/C/F/TAF.  
Nevertheless, the effect of TAF-containing regimens on lipids resembles that of other commonly used ART 
regimens without TDF and the benefits of TAF vs. TDF in terms of renal and bone effects appear to outweigh 
any concerns there may be regarding the lipid profile.  
Arthralgia was noted to show an imbalance in cases suggesting that this could be an ADR. Arthralgia was 
added to the SmPC as an uncommon ADR. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Thus far there have not been any cases of PRT or Fanconi’s syndrome in patients treated with TAF. More 
extensive and longer-term data are needed to confirm the observation. In addition, although data thus far 
support a conclusion that TAF is much less likely than TDF to exert negative effects on BMD or on renal 
function it remains to be seen whether very long term exposure to low TFV plasma levels could have an 
effect. This matter can really only be addressed in routine use. It is particularly important that this matter is 
addressed in adolescents, in whom the use of TDF is restricted at present due to the concerns regarding 
effects on BMD. 
Taking into account the metabolic pathway, it was noted that Grade 3 or 4 hyperuricaemia occurred in 2 
E/C/F/TAF and no non-switch patients in GS-US-292-0109. Also, any grade hyperuricaemia occurred in 
13.2% vs. 5.0% although no AEs were related to abnormal uric acid. Thus far there does not appear to be a 
link between the hyperuricaemia and gout or other AEs that could be due to hyperuricaemia (including renal

stones). However, this matter needs to be kept under review as a potential risk. The possible effect of co-
administering xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol or febuxostat) on the final metabolic fate of TAF also 
needs to be addressed. 
Current data do not suggest that the nonclinical findings translate into a concern regarding the ocular safety 
of TAF. There was one adolescent with uveitis considered to be drug-related by the investigator. At present it 
seems reasonable to keep this issue under close review with appropriate reflection in the RMP. 
In conclusion, only wider and longer-term exposures to TAF and relatively low levels of TFV in adults and in 
adolescents can inform whether chronic exposure to TFV plasma concentrations much lower than observed 
with TDF can eventually lead to the types of ADRs associated with TDF. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
F/TAF when given with EVG and COBI achieved high virologic suppression rates in the ART-naïve and 
maintained suppression after switching from successful regimens. The bridging of F/TAF when used with a 
wide range of third agents in the ART regimen to that observed with Genvoya in the Phase 3 studies is based 
on demonstrations of comparable plasma TAF levels, supported by the TFV-DP concentrations for TAF 
regimens vs. TDF regimens. Taking into account these PK data, as well as the TAF monotherapy data and the 
Emax modelling, there are no major concerns regarding the anticipated efficacy of F/TAF provided that it is 
used in accordance with the SmPC.  
Nevertheless, it remains possible that the efficacy that is observed with F/TAF-containing regimens may vary 
according to the third agent. It is also not possible to rule out entirely that different combination regimens 
could result in variable control of HIV-1 replication in the CNS. Nevertheless, the substantial experience 
gained with effective regimens indicates that so long as profound viral suppression is maintained based on 
measuring plasma levels the risk of escape replication of HIV-1 in the CNS leading to symptoms seems 
remote. The risk that escape replication of HIV-1 in the CNS could ultimately lead to a resurgence of HIV-1 
RNA in plasma also seems to be remote.  
The safety profile of TAF-containing regimens is for the most part similar or improved vs. that of TDF-
containing regimens, especially notable for the reduced renal and bone effects. The fact that lipid 
abnormalities are more likely to occur with TAF then TDF does not impact on the overall conclusions on safety 
and the rates observed are in line with those that occur with other commonly used regimens. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The fixed dose combination F/TAF offers an alternative option to F/TDF with which similar efficacy can be 
expected. The improved renal safety profile allows the administration in patients with estimated creatinine 
clearance > 30 ml/min and no dose adjustments are required. However the potential risk of nephrotoxicity 
from chronic exposure cannot be excluded and deserves to be monitored. Based on the evaluation of quality, 
efficacy and safety data the benefit-risk balance is favourable.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Descovy in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of adults 
and adolescents (aged 12 and older with body weight at least 35 Kg) infected with human immunodeficiency 
virus type 1 (HIV-1) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1), is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
• 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
• 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data, the CHMP considers that tenofovir alafenamide is a derivative of tenofovir 
disoproxil (both prodrugs of tenofovir). The active substance tenofovir alafenamide is contained in the

marketing authorisation Genvoya which was authorised in the Union on 19/11/2015. Tenofovir alafenamide is 
therefore not a new active substance in itself, as it is a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the Union.

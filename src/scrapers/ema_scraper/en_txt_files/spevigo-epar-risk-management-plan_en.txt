Brief description of the product
Spevigo
Centralised
Chemical class
Monoclonal antibody to IL-36R
Summary of mode of action
Spesolimab is a humanised monoclonal IgG1 
antibody to IL-36R. Spesolimab blocks signalling 
of human IL-36R. Binding of spesolimab to IL-
36R is anticipated to prevent the subsequent 
activation of IL-36R by cognate ligands (IL-36 α, 
β, and γ) as well as downstream activation of pro-
inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways.
Important information about its composition
Spesolimab is a humanised monoclonal IgG1 
antibody against human IL-36R. Spesolimab is
expressed in CHO cells. It is manufactured using
standard mammalian cell culture techniques, 
followed by a series of protein purification steps
including several chromatography steps, as well as 
steps for removal and inactivation of potential 
viruses. No materials of animal/human origin are 
used in the manufacturing process.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION AND 
TARGET POPULATIONS
SI.1
SI.1.1
GENERALIZED PUSTULAR PSORIASIS
Incidence
There is currently no published data on the incidence of GPP. A study was conducted by BI 
using the NPR in Sweden to determine the incidence of GPP [R22-0363]. Patients were 
considered as having GPP if they had an ICD-10 diagnosis code L40.1 (“generalised pustular 
psoriasis”) and no previous code for GPP in the NPR. In 2015, the incidence of GPP was 
determined to be 0.82 per 100 000 persons in Sweden.
SI.1.2
Prevalence
Estimates of the prevalence of GPP are sparse in the literature because of the rarity of the 
disease. 6 publications [R16-2698, R18-1635, R20-1502, R21-3418, R21-3492, R22-0363] 
showed the prevalence of GPP in the general population and the range of prevalence was 
between 1.76 per 1 000 000 persons in France [R16-2698] to 4.6 per 100 000 persons in 
Germany [R18-1635]. This large variability in the prevalence estimates may be attributed to 
differences in calculation methodologies. In the French study [R16-2698], the definition of 
GPP was determined by individual dermatologists as no criteria for diagnosis was specified 
in the survey. Additional information on the method used to calculate the prevalence, 
including the size of the denominator, proportion and representativeness of the chosen 
dermatology clinics, and other relevant information was not provided. Therefore, it cannot be 
determined if the prevalence reported is a reliable estimation of the true prevalence of GPP in 
France. GPP is a difficult to diagnose condition and most often diagnosed by a dermatologist, 
but the prevalence estimate in the German study [R18-1635] was not restricted to claims by 
dermatologists only. Therefore, it is possible that patients were incorrectly diagnosed as 
having GPP and the reported prevalence may be an overestimate of the true prevalence.
To better understand the global prevalence of GPP, BI published analyses using 
administrative claims databases from the US, Japan, and Sweden [R21-3418, R22-0363]. In 
the US, individuals enrolled in either the Truven MarketScan administrative claims database 
(from 01 Jan 2018 to 31 Dec 2018) with an ICD-10 code: L40.1 “Generalized pustular 
psoriasis” or the Optum claims database (from 01 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2019) were considered 
GPP patients. The calculated prevalence was 7 per 100 000 persons in the Truven Market 
Scan database and 9 per 100 000 persons in Optum [R21-3418]. It is possible that 
the prevalence in the US claims databases can be either an under or overestimate of the 
true prevalence. Since GPP is difficult to diagnosis, physicians may have incorrectly 
classified the patient as GPP and then subsequently ruled out the diagnosis, leading to an 
overestimate of the prevalence. It is also possible that GPP patients were intentionally 
classified as psoriasis patients in order to receive treatment, thereby underestimating the 
true prevalence.
Prevalence of GPP in Japan was explored using the JMDC and MDV claims databases [R21-
3418]. Similar to other claims databases, an individual was considered to have GPP if they 
had an ICD-10 diagnosis code of L40.1. In 2018, the GPP prevalence was 2 per 
Boehringer Ingelheim
Risk Management Plan
Version 1.0
Page 12 of 124 
Spevigo (spesolimab) 
s00088360-05
100 000 persons in MDV and 3 per 100 000 persons in JMDC. Both databases have their 
limitations that may suggest the calculated prevalence is an underestimate of the true
prevalence in Japan. MDV is a hospital-based system and patients outside of the MDV 
system would not be captured in the database. JMDC is an employer-based health insurance 
system. Older individuals and those who cannot work are not well represented in JMDC, 
therefore individuals with a more debilitating course of GPP may not be included in the 
database.
BI also collaborated with the University of Peking to estimate the prevalence of GPP in 
China. ICD-10 diagnosis codes plus free text from a claims database was evaluated and 
the prevalence was determined to be in the range of 1 per 100 000 to 10 per 100 000 persons
[R21-3492].
A collaboration with the National Psoriasis Register (PsoReg) and the IHE in Sweden to 
better understand the prevalence and incidence, natural history and patient reported burden of 
GPP is ongoing. Using data from the NPR, individuals were considered to have GPP if they 
had a first or second ICD-10 diagnosis code of L40.1. In 2015, the prevalence of GPP in 
Sweden was 9 per 100 000 persons. The NPR does not contain primary care data but has 
comprehensive secondary care data on the entire Swedish population, so it is likely 
the prevalence estimate is close to the true prevalence of GPP in Sweden [R22-0363].
The prevalence of GPP from the published literature as well as the estimates calculated from 
work done internally show GPP as a rare condition with a prevalence range of approximately 
2 per 1 000 000 to 46 per 100 000 persons and is summarised in the table below.

Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, 
gender, and risk factors for the disease
There is limited data describing the demographic profile of patients with GPP. Among adult 
patients with GPP, there is some published literature suggesting a slightly higher proportion 
of females compared to males (ranging from 58% to 67%) [R16-0933, R21-2844]. These data 
are consistent with internal analyses conducted using the US Optum and Truven MarketScan 
databases. Of the 1175 patients with a GPP diagnosis code identified in Truven MarketScan 
between October 2015 and September 2018, 63.3% were female [R21-2243]. Similarly, 
67.6% of the 1669 GPP patients were female in the Optum database [R21-2244]. However, 
internal analyses using the Japan claims databases showed a slightly higher proportion of 
females in the MDV database but a higher proportion of males in the JMDC database (51.6% 
vs 38.5% female in MDV and JMDC, respectively [R20-3140, R20-3139].
Various factors may precipitate flares of GPP. The use of and withdrawal of systemic 
corticosteroids, other drug-specific allergic reactions, pregnancy, infection and stress are all 
reported triggers of GPP [R20-1248, R18-1887, R17-3458]. The most comprehensive data on 
potential risk factors for GPP was reported from a case series of 102 patients with GPP in 
Malaysia [R16-0933]. The most commonly reported risk factor was a history of psoriasis 
(77.5% of patients). This was followed by the use of any medical treatment (56.9% of 
patients reporting either traditional or Western medical treatment preceding their GPP 
episode). Importantly, this was driven by the use of corticosteroids specifically, which was 
reported among 44% of all cases. Preceding infection was reported among 19.6% of patients 
with GPP and pregnancy was reported as a precipitating factor among 25% of female 
patients.
SI.1.4
The main existing treatment options
Therapeutic intervention in GPP is a major challenge. To date, there are no approved 
therapies indicated for treatment of GPP flares, despite the morbidity and mortality associated 
with GPP flares. There is limited evidence on the efficacy and safety for the use of non-
targeted immunomodulatory therapies (e.g. methotrexate, cyclosporine, retinoids, systemic 
corticosteroids) for the treatment of GPP flares. Most of these therapies used in clinical 
practice are associated with toxicities that make them inappropriate for continued use [R17-
3600, R19-1562]. Side effects, such as hair loss, excessive hair growth, and teratogenicity 
particularly limit the use of these treatments in women, who may be disproportionately 
affected. Additionally, many of these treatments do not fully alleviate the symptoms of GPP. 
According to experienced clinicians attending BI-sponsored advisory boards, one third of 
patients with acute GPP treated with acitretin still have chronic ill-defined erythema and 
plaques affecting 30% to 50% of the BSA.
The limitation in efficacy and safety data also applies to the use of biologic treatment options 
in GPP, including TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, infliximab, and certolizumab pegol), IL-17 
inhibitors (secukinumab, brodalumab, and ixekizumab), and IL-23 inhibitors (risankizumab 
and guselkumab). The approval of these biologics in Japan for the treatment of GPP is based 
on evidence from endpoints assessing any improvement (without the need for complete 
pustular clearance) at late time points (e.g. 12 to 16 weeks) in small (<12 patients), open-

label, single-arm trials only [R16-1462, R17-3596, R17-3604, R18-2718, R18-2719, R18-
2720]. As the trials investigated GPP prevention only, there is a lack of data on the impact of 
these biologics on flare treatment (e.g. time to flare resolution and sustainability of response).
Based on the limitations described above, current therapeutic options such as cyclosporine, 
methotrexate, retinoids, and biologics have not been investigated in well-controlled CTs, are 
administered off-label and accordingly not suitable for long-term treatment and do not 
provide sustained responses in most patients.
SI.1.5
Natural history of the indicated condition in the population, including 
mortality and morbidity
The published literature on the natural history of GPP flares comes from a few studies 
looking at a small number of GPP patients. Flare frequency was evaluated in a study of 27 
patients with juvenile onset GPP in Malaysia [R17-3458], 48% (n=13) experienced 1 pustular 
episode over a 6-month period, 33% (n=9) experienced 2 to 5 episodes, and 19% (n=5) 
experienced 5 or more episodes. A similar distribution of pustular episodes was observed in a 
study of 102 patients with adult onset GPP in Malaysia [R16-0933]. From 1989 to 2011, 58% 
of patients (n=59) experienced 1 pustular flare (covering >30% BSA), 29% (n=30) 
experienced 2 to 5 flares, and 13% (n=13) experienced 5 or more flares. Finally, in the study 
in France [R16-2960], 19 flares were reported among 11 patients with GPP, resulting in a 
mean of 1.7 (SD=0.9) flares per patient; however, the study period and length of follow-up 
were not reported for this study.
Flare duration was evaluated in the study of 102 patients with adult onset GPP in Malaysia 
[R16-0933] and found a mean duration of 16 days, with a range from 7 to 60 days. In the 
study of 11 patients with GPP in France [R16-2960], 7/11 patients (64%) experienced 
clearance of their pustules for 1 of their flares within 7 days, whilst 4/11 patients (36%) 
achieved pustule clearance for 1 of their flares within 8 to 28 days. In the 3 publications on 
Chinese GPP patients treated with retinoids [R20-3869, R20-3870, R20-3871], it took on 
average ≥2 weeks for complete clearing of the pustules. Based on the limited information 
provided for the time to clearance of the other types of skin lesions of GPP [R20-3871], 
clearance of these seemed to take much longer, i.e. an average of around 1 month for the 
clearance of erythema.
To better understand the natural course of flares in GPP, a survey of HCPs enrolled in the 
CorEvitas (formerly Corrona) Psoriasis Registry was conducted. To participate in the HCP 
survey, dermatologists in the CorEvitas Psoriasis Registry who had treated adult (aged ≥18 
years) patients with GPP within the past 5 years were eligible. The survey included 28 
multiple choice questions exploring acute GPP flare onset and diagnosis, flare frequency and 
duration, treatment of flares, treatment of residual disease, and physicians’ overall experience 
of managing patients with GPP. Most respondents (69%) estimated that their patients had an 
average of 0-1 flare per year, and 28% estimated 2-3 per year. Over half of respondents 
(55%) reported that flares typically last 2-4 weeks, and 41% reported flare duration of 
1-3 months. The majority (52%) of dermatologists believe that skin lesions take the shortest 
time to resolve (2-4 weeks), whilst pustules and erythema require 1-3 months for resolution, 
according to 48% and 59% of respondents [R21-0751].

A similar survey of patients was conducted to better understand their experiences living with 
and managing GPP. This survey was done in collaboration with Healthivibe. Of the 66 
respondents, 41% experienced 2-3 flares per year, and 46% experienced ≥4 flares in a 12 
month period. More than three-quarters (76%) of respondents indicated their flares were 
severe in a nature, and almost a quarter (23%) of patients surveyed visited an emergency 
department because of their GPP flare. Even after the flares have resolved, 77% of 
respondents still expected some residual symptoms when their condition is “under control” 
(data on file).
A retrospective study using the SNDS administrative database in France was conducted to 
identify flares in patients with GPP [R21-1156]. Acute GPP flares were characterised from 
patient data between 2010-2018 using the following algorithm: treatment for GPP, with 
ICD-10 code L40.1 as the primary diagnosis in a medical, surgical, or obstetric inpatient 
setting, and hospitalisation for ≥3 days. Overall, 1842 unique incident patients with GPP were 
identified. Of these patients, 30.9% (569) had ≥1 flare and 6.2% (115) had ≥2 flares during 
the study period, with patients experiencing an overall mean 1.4 (SD 1.14) flares, with 1.26 
(SD 0.82) flares per person-year. All-cause mortality for these patients was estimated. 
Mortality within the first 4 weeks after the last flare was 2.5%, and the median time to death 
for these patients was 15.64 days (SD 7.97). Throughout the entire study period, all-cause 
mortality was calculated to be 24.4%.
Though mortality related to GPP is difficult to estimate at a population level due to 
inconsistent and incomplete follow-up, 7 GPP mortality estimates have been published in the 
last 25 years. The reported mortality due to GPP or associated treatment ranged between 2% 
and 7% [R16-2698, R16-0933, R16-1463, R17-3456, R17-3605, R21-0384, R21-2789]. 
Deaths were directly attributable to GPP or associated treatment, especially with the use of 
systemic corticosteroids [R16-0933, R17-3456, R16-1463]. Life-threatening complications of 
GPP include sepsis and renal, hepatic, respiratory, and cardiac failure [R16-0933]. Sepsis was 
a common cause of death [R16-0933, R16-1463, R17-3605].
SI.1.6
Important co-morbidities
Co-morbidities occurring more frequently in GPP patients than in patients with plaque 
psoriasis and the general population in US claims data sources [R20-3323, R20-3324] include 
the following:
 Hyperlipidaemia
 Psoriatic arthritis
 Type 2 diabetes
 Obesity
 COPD

MODULE SII
NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
SII.1
KEY SAFETY FINDINGS FROM NON-CLINICAL STUDIES AND 
RELEVANCE TO HUMAN USAGE
SII.1.1
Toxicity
As spesolimab does not demonstrate adequate pharmacological activity in common
toxicology species, a surrogate antibody (BI 674304) specific for mouse IL-36R was
developed and used for toxicology assessments. In intravenous toxicity studies of up to 
26 weeks in duration in mice, no adverse effects of IL-36R antagonism were seen at a dose 
that was 5-fold higher than the dose that was protective in an experimental mouse colonic
inflammation model. These preclinical data suggest spesolimab can safely be administered
chronically to humans. In addition, a recent characterisation of individuals with homozygous
IL-36R loss-of-function mutations revealed that normal immune function was broadly
preserved and that the medical history of these individuals showed no increased risk of
infections or malignancies. These data suggest that IL-36 signalling pathway inhibition may
not substantially compromise host defences [R17-3632].
SII.1.1.1
Reproductive and developmental toxicity
There was no evidence of effects on fertility or development in mice after administration of 
50 mg/kg/dose of BI 674304 in directed fertility, and embryonic, and pre- and post-natal 
development studies [n00243849-01, n00254965-01, n00271726-01].
SII.1.1.2
Carcinogenicity
As spesolimab is not pharmacologically active in rodents, traditional carcinogenicity studies 
were not performed. Based on a review of the scientific literature, the mechanism of action of 
spesolimab is not expected to be carcinogenic or to increase the risk of cancer. To date, no 
evidence of carcinogenic potential has arisen in either non-clinical IL-36R knock-out mouse 
phenotypic assessments, in repeat dose toxicology studies using the surrogate antibody
BI 674304, or in clinical trials using spesolimab [n00232540-01, n00234384-01,
n00235413-01, n00243876-01, n00257882-01, n00265831-02].
SII.1.2
Safety pharmacology
As spesolimab is not pharmacologically active in common toxicology species, safety 
pharmacology assessments were not conducted.
SII.1.3
Other toxicity-related information or data
Immunohistochemistry techniques were used to assess the binding of spesolimab to human 
tissues. In this assay, spesolimab stained the membrane of epithelium cells in a variety of 
tissues which is consistent with the known expression of IL-36R [n00239291-01].

MODULE SIV POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS
SIV.1
EXCLUSION CRITERIA IN PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS
WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME
History of allergy/hypersensitivity to a systemically administered trial medication 
agent or its excipients
Reason for exclusion
Patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to the 
active substance or to any of the excipients are excluded 
from clinical trials for safety reasons, to safeguard the 
wellbeing of susceptible patients.
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information?
No
Rationale
Severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity to the active 
substance or to any of the excipients is covered in the 
SmPC under the “Contraindications” section (including 
further references to the “List of excipients” and “Special 
Warnings and Precautions” sections).
Hypersensitivity may include immediate reactions such as 
anaphylaxis and delayed reactions such as DRESS and is 
covered in the SmPC (“Special Warnings and 
Precautions”). Systemic hypersensitivity reaction is 
defined as an important potential risk.
Pregnant or breast-feeding women
Reason for exclusion
Clinical trials in pregnant or breast-feeding women cannot 
be conducted for ethical reasons.
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information?
Yes
Rationale
Limited experience is available from clinical trial data; 
post-marketing data is not yet available. There was no 
evidence of effects on fertility or embryonic development 
in mice after administration of 50 mg/kg/dose of 
spesolimab in directed fertility, and embryonic, and pre-
and post-natal development studies. Due to the negative 
outcome of the completed teratogenicity study a double 
barrier method of contraception is not required. This topic 
is considered missing information.

Patient with relevant acute or chronic infections, including HIV, or viral hepatitis
Reason for exclusion
Patients with relevant acute or chronic infections are 
excluded from clinical trials for safety reasons, to 
safeguard the wellbeing of susceptible patients and to 
improve interpretability of data by reducing confounding
factors like pre-existing infections
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information?
No
Rationale
Very limited experience is available from clinical trial 
data; post-marketing data is not yet available. Instructions 
for patients with a chronic infection or a history of 
recurrent infection is given in the SmPC (“Special 
Warnings and Precautions”). This topic is addressed under 
the important potential risk ‘Serious or opportunistic 
infections’.
Patient with active tuberculosis
Reason for exclusion
Patients with active tuberculosis are excluded from clinical 
trials for safety reasons, to safeguard the wellbeing of 
susceptible patients and to improve interpretability of data 
by reducing confounding factors like pre-existing 
infections
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information?
No
Rationale
Evaluation of tuberculosis status prior to initiation of 
treatment with spesolimab and anti-tuberculosis therapy 
prior to treatment with spesolimab in patients with 
tuberculosis or a history of tuberculosis is covered in the 
SmPC (“Special Warnings and Precautions”). This topic is 
addressed under the important potential risk ‘Serious or 
opportunistic infections’.

Patient with any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of 
malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, except appropriately treated basal or 
squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of uterine cervix
Reason for exclusion
Patients with active or suspected malignancy or a history 
of malignancy are excluded from clinical trials for safety 
reasons and to improve interpretability of data by reducing 
interfering factors like pre-existing or relapsing 
malignancies.
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information?
No
Rationale
No experience is available from clinical trial data; post-
marketing data is not yet available.
Patients with malignancies have been excluded from the 
clinical trials conducted with spesolimab. Therefore, the 
safety and efficacy of spesolimab has not been studied in 
this population. This topic is addressed under the 
important potential risk ‘Malignancy’.
Children and adolescents <18 years of age
Reason for exclusion
Clinical development programmes routinely start with 
clinical trials in adults. Adolescents ≥12 years of age are
included in trial 1368-0027. Dedicated paediatric 
development plans for the different indications for 
spesolimab are under preparation.
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information?
No
Rationale
Patients <18 years are investigated in dedicated paediatric 
development programmes. In patients with GPP, 
adolescents ≥12 years are in addition allowed for inclusion 
in parts of the adult development programme.
Elderly patients >75 years of age
Reason for exclusion
At the current stage of development, most clinical trials 
with spesolimab limit the inclusion of adults to an age up 
to 75 years. Nevertheless, open-label extension trials do 
not contain an age-related criterion.
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information?
No
Rationale
There is no indication that the safety profile of spesolimab 
may change with increasing age. Elderly patients per se 
might be at a higher risk of infection.

Administration of live virus vaccination from 6 weeks prior and during spesolimab 
treatment
Reason for exclusion
Administration of live virus vaccination is excluded from 
6 weeks prior to start until the end of spesolimab treatment 
for safety reasons.
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information?
No
Rationale
No specific studies have been conducted in patients who 
have recently received live viral or live bacterial vaccines. 
The possibilities to further characterise the topic are
expected to be very limited; no clinical trial data will 
address the risk. Risk minimisation measures for this topic 
are in place as a warning in the SmPC. Spontaneous post-
marketing reporting on this topic will likely be very 
limited.
Concomitant treatment with other biologicals
Reason for exclusion
Concomitant treatment with other approved or non-
approved investigational biologicals was excluded in most 
spesolimab clinical trials as part of the standardisation to 
improve interpretability of safety and efficacy data.
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information?
No
Rationale
Experience from concomitant use of spesolimab and other 
GPP treatments (e.g. such as biologics) is limited. The use 
of spesolimab as monotherapy is added to the SmPC of 
spesolimab i.v. for GPP flare treatment.
Major surgical procedure within 12 weeks prior to or planned for during spesolimab 
treatment 
Reason for exclusion 
Standard criterion related to subject compliance during a 
trial. This criterion limits any potential bias on the efficacy 
and safety results in a trial.
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No
Rationale
Standard exclusion criterion for clinical trials. There is no 
evidence to suggest that the efficacy or safety of 
spesolimab is affected by major surgical procedure within 
12 weeks prior to or planned for during spesolimab 
treatment.

POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES
Spesolimab is available as prescription medicine only and administered in a healthcare setting 
by physicians experienced in the management of patients with inflammatory skin diseases. 
Pharmacological properties, non-clinical, and clinical data do not indicate an impact on the 
central nervous system suggestive for stimulant, depressant, hallucinogenic, or mood-
elevating effects, or other effects that might lead to dependency. Abuse for illegal purpose is 
not expected with spesolimab.

IDENTIFICATION OF SAFETY CONCERNS IN THE INITIAL 
RMP SUBMISSION
Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP:
The following risks are ADRs that require no further characterisation and are followed up via 
routine pharmacovigilance (signal detection, adverse reaction reporting):
 Fatigue
 Pruritis
 Upper respiratory tract infection
 Urinary tract infection

Injection site reactions
SVII.1.2
Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns 
in the RMP
The patient population for the RMP analyses are patients with GPP who experience an acute 
flare with supplemental data being provided based on trials of spesolimab in healthy 
volunteers, GPP patients on maintenance treatment, and trials of spesolimab in other diseases, 
including PPP, UC, and AtD; see Section SVII.3 for further details.
Based on all available data, there are no important identified risks for spesolimab.
SVII.1.2.1
Important potential risk: Serious or opportunistic infections
Risk-benefit impact:
A theoretical risk of serious and opportunistic infections exists for all immune-modulating 
biologic medications. Risk of infection is due to potential alteration of the immune response 
to pathogens [R20-3252, R20-3223, R20-3221].
There was no signal for infections in non-clinical trials (see Module SII). Further, a recent 
published analysis of 12 human subjects with IL-36R KO mutations showed no evidence of 
history of recurrent infections and all showed normal leukocyte counts [R17-3632].
In the clinical development programme of spesolimab to date, a higher proportion of patients 
with infections was noted after spesolimab than placebo treatment. Nevertheless, infections 
were mild to moderate and non-serious. There was no indication for a higher proportion of

patients with serious or opportunistic infections (SCS spesolimab [c32483404-01], 
Section 2.1.7.2).
Therefore, serious or opportunistic infections are considered an important potential risk for 
spesolimab. A potential impact on individual health and on individual benefit-risk cannot be 
excluded.
For further details on seriousness, frequency, and severity refer to Section SVII.3.1.1.3.

A theoretical risk of systemic immediate or delayed (including DRESS) hypersensitivity 
reaction exists for all immune-modulating biologic medications. In principle, hypersensitivity 
reactions (including infusion-related reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and DRESS) are 
possible with any foreign substance, particularly protein-based therapeutics [R20-3220].
Based on the safety data collected in clinical trials with spesolimab, injection site reactions 
(including injection site erythema, injection site swelling, injection site pain, injection site 
induration, and injection site warmth) were identified as ADRs for spesolimab in the 
treatment of GPP flares (SCS spesolimab [c32483404-01], Section 2.6). However, these were 
limited, if observed, to localised symptoms such as erythema, swelling and pain at the 
injection site.
No signal of systemic hypersensitivity including infusion reaction and anaphylactic reaction 
was identified.
The potential immunogenicity of spesolimab is low [c35356518-01]. The likelihood of an 
immune reaction in response to spesolimab was found to be similar to that obtained for 
therapeutic monoclonal antibodies associated with relatively low levels of clinical 
immunogenicity. However, predicted CD4 T-cell epitopes were identified in both the variable 
heavy and light chain sequences of spesolimab, which raises the possibility that 
administration could induce a T-cell dependent humoral immune response.
Symptoms observed in 2 patients receiving spesolimab in a trial in patients with GPP flares 
were reported as DRESS (with RegiSCAR scores 1 and 3) [P14-06207], and in close 
temporal relationship to the reported GPP flares, which was 2 days after start of treatment 
with spesolimab in 1 case. Both patients received concomitant medication at the time of the 
DRESS, which included cefuroxime, cefepime, spiramycin, and paracetamol. The rapid 
occurrence of symptoms after spesolimab administration in 1 case makes a causal 
relationship between spesolimab and DRESS implausible. In the other case, similar 
cutaneous symptoms re-occurred after re-administration with spiramycin, suggesting 
spiramycin as an alternative explanation.
No cases of DRESS were reported in any other trial conducted with spesolimab in other 
diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, AtD, or PPP.

Systemic hypersensitivity reaction, including DRESS, is considered an important potential 
risk for spesolimab. A potential impact on individual health and on individual benefit-risk 
cannot be excluded.
For further details on seriousness, frequency, and severity refer to Section SVII.3.1.2.3.
SVII.1.2.3
Important potential risk: Malignancy
Risk-benefit impact:
To date, no evidence of carcinogenic potential has arisen in either non-clinical IL-36R KO 
mouse phenotypic assessments, or in repeat dose toxicology studies using the surrogate 
antibody BI 674304, or in clinical trials using spesolimab. Since rodent non-clinical 
carcinogenicity studies using the clinical candidate spesolimab are not feasible owing to lack 
of pharmacological relevance of the rodent, no additional non-clinical studies are planned as 
they would not add value to the current assessment [n00265831-02].
Meta-analyses of cancer incidence among patients that have received immune suppression 
therapy (e.g. TNFs, methotrexate) have not yielded clear correlation between tumour 
incidence and therapies not intended to completely ablate immune function [n00265831-02].
A theoretical risk of malignancy exists for all immune-modulating biologic medications
including spesolimab. The risk of malignancy is potentially increased due to impaired 
immune defences [R20-3218]. Malignancy is considered an important potential risk for 
spesolimab. A potential impact on individual health and on individual benefit-risk cannot be 
excluded.
For further details on seriousness, frequency, and severity refer to Section SVII.3.1.3.3.
SVII.1.2.4
Important potential risk: Peripheral neuropathy
Risk-benefit impact:
The potential for peripheral neuropathy with spesolimab is unknown. In preclinical toxicity 
studies with the surrogate antibody BI 674304, no histopathological changes were noted in 
the nervous system. There is no indication from the literature, that the inhibition of the IL-36 
pathway is linked to an increased risk of treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy.
Cases of peripheral neuropathy were reported in clinical trials with spesolimab (investigator 
reporting). However, the reported cases showed a heterogenous clinical pattern and a causal 
association with spesolimab for any of the reported cases was assessed to be unlikely as per 
independent external expert adjudication.
Peripheral neuropathy is considered an important potential risk for spesolimab. A potential 
impact on individual health and on individual benefit-risk cannot be excluded.
For further details on the reported cases refer to Section SVII.3.1.4.

Missing information: Pregnant or breast-feeding women
Risk-benefit impact:
There are limited data from the use of spesolimab in pregnant women. Pre-clinical studies 
using a surrogate, mouse specific anti-IL-36R monoclonal antibody do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary measure, it 
is recommended to avoid the use of spesolimab in pregnancy, unless the expected clinical 
benefit clearly outweighs the potential risks.
Very limited experience is available from clinical trial data; post-marketing data is not yet 
available. The risk for the unborn or breastfed child is not known, but cannot be excluded. 
Therefore, this topic is considered missing information.

DETAILS OF IMPORTANT IDENTIFIED RISKS, IMPORTANT 
POTENTIAL RISKS, AND MISSING INFORMATION
Data from all completed or ongoing clinical trials were considered for the analysis of safety 
concerns. The primary focus of the analysis is on the GPP trials in patients receiving 
spesolimab 900 mg i.v. or placebo i.v. (1368-0013, 1368-0025, and 1368-0027). Supportive 
data from trial 1368-0011 (GPP indication) and placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trials 
conducted in other diseases (UC [1368-0005, 1368-0010], PPP [1368-0015, 1368-0016], and 
AtD [1368-0032]) is provided in Appendix 7. Additional long-term data will be available 
from the ongoing extension trial 1368-0025 (trial duration 5 years) and trial 1368-0027 (trial 
duration 1 year).
Due to the heterogeneity of the clinical trials in the spesolimab clinical development 
programme regarding trial characteristics, indication, dosing and route of administration, the 
characterisation of risks is based on data from individual trials rather than on pooled data.
For the GPP trials in patients receiving spesolimab 900 mg i.v. or placebo i.v., the following 
treatment periods are analysed and presented:

day of last spesolimab in the trial +112 or the last 
contact date per EoS page if patient did not roll over or 
the day prior to first dose in the extension trial if patient 
rolled over.
All maintenance treatment periods and all flare rescue 
treatment periods were pooled and analysed by per 
patient analysis.
From date/time of start of the first rescue treatment to 
earliest of: date of any trial treatment +112 days for 
patients with flare, the day of EoS if patients did not roll 
over, the day before first dose in open-label trial if 
patients rolled over or the cut-off date of interim 
analysis, if applicable.
1 Data after intake of (optional) open-label spesolimab on day 8 or rescue medication with spesolimab for treatment of a 
GPP flare were censored for reporting.
2 For the RMP analyses, the definition of the REP was harmonised to 16 weeks across all trials.
3 Patients received  1 to 3 doses of randomised and/or non-randomised spesolimab. Number of doses administered in trial 
1368-0013: 1 dose of 900 mg i.v. in the up to week 1 and 12 analysis periods; up to 3 doses of 900 mg i.v. in REP (data

Important potential risk: Serious or opportunistic infections
SVII.3.1.1.1
Potential mechanisms
Like all immune modulating agents, spesolimab may have the potential to alter the immune 
response resulting in a potential risk of infection. A recent characterisation of individuals 
with homozygous IL-36R KO mutations revealed that normal immune function was broadly

preserved suggesting that IL-36 signalling pathway inhibition does not compromise host 
defences [R17-3632].
SVII.3.1.1.2
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
There was no indication for an increased occurrence of serious or opportunistic infections in 
clinical trials with spesolimab.
The MAH is planning a voluntary PASS (1368-0128) to further investigate this potential risk.
SVII.3.1.1.3
Characterisation of the risk
Cases of serious or opportunistic infections were analysed using the following searches 
(MedDRA version 23.1):
 All serious events in the SOC ‘Infections and infestations’
 All events in the SOC ‘Infections and infestations’ of at least severe RCTC grade
 Narrow SMQ ‘Opportunistic infections’
 BIcMQ ‘Infections’, narrow sub-search 8.2 ‘Tuberculosis related terms’ (see
Appendix 7 for a list of PTs in included in the BIcMQ)
Summary (indication GPP and other diseases)
There were 4 patients with serious, severe, or opportunistic infections in the GPP trials in 
patients receiving spesolimab 900 mg i.v. or placebo i.v.:
 Trial 1368-0013: 3 patients (1 patient in the placebo group following open-label
spesolimab infusion [i.e. after 1 spesolimab dose] and 2 in the spesolimab group
[1 each before and after open-label spesolimab infusion]). The reported PTs were
‘Urinary tract infection’, ‘Influenza’, and ‘Latent tuberculosis’.
 Trial 1368-0025: 1 patient (PT ‘Pneumonia’)
There were no patients with serious, severe, or opportunistic infections in the remaining GPP, 
PPP, or AtD trials. There were 2 patients with a serious infection in the UC trials (both 
placebo):
 Trial 1368-0005: 1 patient (PT ‘Clostridium difficile colitis’)
 Trial 1368-0010: 1 patient (PT ‘Rectal abscess’)
Like all immune modulating agents, spesolimab may have the potential to alter the immune 
response resulting in a potential risk of infection. However, effective treatment options for 
serious or opportunistic infections are available and potential infections are not expected to 
have a relevant impact on the overall risk-benefit assessment.

GPP trials in patients receiving spesolimab 900 mg i.v. or placebo i.v.
Trial 1368-0013
Up to week 1
There was 1 patient with a serious infection (PT ‘Urinary tract infection’) in the spesolimab 
900 mg i.v. group. The patient had fever, drowsiness, hypocalcaemia, and hypokalaemia as 
baseline conditions, prompting suspicion of sepsis in addition to GPP flare; serious UTI was 
diagnosed on day 3. Co-medications at baseline (started before UTI diagnosis) included
cefuroxime, potassium chloride, paracetamol, cefepime and calcium carbonate. The event 
required/prolonged hospitalisation, was of moderate intensity, and the patient recovered (data 
on file, analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘serious infections’ Tables A.2.1.2: 1 and A.2.1.2: 2; and 
CTR 1368-0013, Section 12.1.2.6.3 [c31523813-01]).
Up to week 12
There were no patients with serious, severe, or opportunistic infections up to week 12 (data 
on file, analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘serious infections’, ‘severe infections’, ‘opportunistic 
infections’, ‘tuberculosis infections’ Table A.2.1.1: 1).
By treatment period of spesolimab use (including REP of any randomised treatment or non-
randomised spesolimab)/overall period post use
There were 2 additional patients in this analysis period:

1 patient with a serious infection (PT ‘Influenza’) (post open-label spesolimab day 8).
The event required/prolonged hospitalisation, was of moderate intensity, and the
patient recovered. The event developed in winter, a month after the investigator had
recommended influenza vaccination (due to risk factors), but the vaccination was not
performed. In addition, a bacterial superinfection was reported. The bacteriological
analysis revealed moderately rich flora of oro-pharyngeal type. At day+1, result was
1x107 CFU/mL (or g), confirming flora of oro-pharyngeal type, and the antigen tests
for Streptococcus pneumoniae interstitial cystitis and Legionella pneumophila
interstitial cystitis were negative (data on file, analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘serious
infections’ Tables A.2.1.3: 1 and A.2.1.3: 2; and CTR 1368-0013, Section 12.1.2.6.3
[c31523813-01]).

1 patient with latent tuberculosis (placebo group, receiving post open-label
spesolimab at day 8):
A Quantiferon tuberculosis test was scheduled for each patient at screening and at
week 12; unscheduled tests could be done if required. 3 patients had a positive
tuberculosis result at week 12, after testing negative at screening. This comprised
2 patients in the placebo group and 1 patient in the spesolimab group (CTR 1368-
0013 [c31523813-01], Section 12.3.5). 1 patient (placebo group) was reported with
latent tuberculosis after receiving open-label spesolimab at day 8. The AE was non-
serious and of mild intensity (data on file, analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘tuberculosis
infections’ Tables A.2.1.3: 1 and A.2.1.3: 2). No relevant history or baseline
conditions were reported for this patient. As the patient had no respiratory symptoms
or abnormalities on pulmonary function tests and chest X-ray was normal, active
tuberculosis was excluded. The patient was treated with isoniazid and successfully
rolled over into the open-label extension trial. The remaining 2 patients (1 placebo,

1 spesolimab) had a negative re-test at screening for the open-label extension trial 
1368-0025 (CTR 1368-0013 [c31523813-01], Sections 12.3.5 and 12.12.6.3).
Furthermore, 2 patients (1 placebo, 1 spesolimab) converted from a negative baseline 
to an indeterminate tuberculosis test at or after week 12, but both re-tested negative at 
screening for the open-label extension trial 1368-0025. 1 patient in the spesolimab 
group had an indeterminate Quantiferon test at baseline with 3 subsequent 
(unscheduled) negative tests. Moreover, 1 patient in the spesolimab group with a 
history of active tuberculosis tested Quantiferon positive at baseline. After ruling out 
active disease, this patient completed trial treatment with an expected positive 
Quantiferon test at week 12 and at an unscheduled follow-up visit (at week 16) (CTR 
1368-0013 [c31523813-01], Section 12.3.5).
Trial 1368-0025 (entire treatment period)
There was 1 patient with serious infection (PT ‘Pneumonia’). The event was pneumonia of 
probable bacterial origin. Sputum cytobacteriological examination analysed poor flora of 
buccopharyngeal origin without predominance. Legionella and pneumococcus testing was 
negative. The event required/prolonged hospitalisation, was of severe intensity, and the 
patient recovered (data on file, analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘serious infections’ Tables
A.2.3.1: 1 and A.2.3.1: 2).
Trial 1368-0027 (open-label overall period)
There were no patients with serious, severe, or opportunistic infections (data on file, analyses 
for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘serious infections’, ‘severe infections’, ‘opportunistic infections’, 
‘tuberculosis infections’ Table A.2.4.1: 1).
SVII.3.1.1.4
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk factors for infection may include in general increased age, impaired immune function, 
presence of comorbidities, and duration of exposure to and the number of concomitant 
immunosuppressive therapies. For patients with GPP, there is very limited epidemiological 
data and no clear indication for an increased risk of serious or opportunistic infections [R16-
0933].
SVII.3.1.1.5
Preventability
Exposure to patients with active or latent mycobacterium tuberculosis infections and relevant 
chronic or acute infections including HIV and viral hepatitis is limited. Therefore, 
preventability of serious or opportunistic infections in the context of spesolimab use is not 
known.
Evaluation of tuberculosis status prior to initiation of treatment with spesolimab and anti-
tuberculosis therapy prior to treatment with spesolimab in patients with tuberculosis or a 
history of tuberculosis is covered in the SmPC. Spesolimab is contraindicated to patients with 
active tuberculosis infection.

Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
GPP is regarded to represent a severe, potentially life-threatening disease. GPP flares can be 
fatal. Serious or opportunistic infections can potentially lead to hospitalisations, and can be 
fatal or life-threatening. In general, effective treatment options are available. Overall, 
infections are not expected to have a relevant impact on the overall risk-benefit assessment.
SVII.3.1.1.7
Public health impact
A potential impact on public health is not expected.
SVII.3.1.2
Important potential risk: Systemic hypersensitivity reaction
SVII.3.1.2.1
Potential mechanisms
Spesolimab is a humanised monoclonal IgG1 antibody. The presence of modified proteins in 
the human blood may result in a certain risk for the occurrence of allergic reactions. The 
potential immunogenicity of spesolimab is low, as described in Section SVII.1.2.2.
SVII.3.1.2.2
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
There is a general risk for proteins to cause hypersensitivity reactions. Humanisation of the 
parental murine monoclonal antibody has reduced relative intrinsic immunogenic potential, 
as assessed by in silico prediction of CD4 T-cell epitopes, to a level consistent with that of 
therapeutic monoclonal antibodies associated with low to negligible levels of clinically 
impactful immunogenicity. However, predicted CD4 T-cell epitopes were identified in both 
the variable heavy and light chain sequences of spesolimab, which raises the possibility that 
administration of spesolimab could induce a T-cell dependent humoral immune response 
(data on file, prospective IRA Appendix 6, Section 2.4).
Based on the results from trial 1368-0013, there was no evidence that events of 
hypersensitivity were associated with spesolimab treatment. No additional risk minimisation 
measures for the important potential risk ‘systemic hypersensitivity reactions’ are planned.
The MAH is planning a voluntary PASS (1368-0128) to further investigate this potential risk.
SVII.3.1.2.3
Characterisation of the risk
Cases of systemic hypersensitivity reaction were analysed using a combined search of the 
narrow SMQs ‘Anaphylactic reaction’, ‘Angioedema’, and ‘Hypersensitivity’ (MedDRA 
version 23.1).
Cases of DRESS were analysed using the narrow SMQ ‘Drug reaction with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms syndrome’ (MedDRA version 23.1).
Summary (indication GPP and other diseases)
The number of patients with systemic hypersensitivity reaction in the GPP trials in patients 
receiving spesolimab 900 mg i.v. or placebo i.v. was low (5 patients in trial 1368-0013, 
including 2 DRESS cases of which 1 was life-threatening, and 4 patients in trial 1368-0025).

In line with the supportive data from other diseases (UC, PPP, AtD; see Appendix 7), the 
reported hypersensitivity events were mainly non-serious, of mild to moderate intensity, and 
the majority of patients recovered. There was 1 life-threatening hypersensitivity event (trial 
1368-0005, PT ‘Infusion related reaction’, see Appendix 7 for details).
Based on the analyses of the frequency of injection site reactions in clinical trials, there is no 
evidence for spesolimab to induce clinically relevant hypersensitivity. The observed 
injections site reactions were non-serious and of mild intensity and rather local tolerability.
GPP trials in patients receiving spesolimab 900 mg i.v. or placebo i.v.
Trial 1368-0013
Up to week 1
1 patient (5.6%) in the placebo group and 3 patients (8.6%) in the spesolimab 900 mg i.v. 
group were reported with hypersensitivity reactions. There was 1 serious event (DRESS, 
reported by 1 patient in the spesolimab 900 mg i.v. group; the event required/prolonged 
hospitalisation, was of moderate intensity, and the patient recovered). Except for the event of 
DRESS, all remaining events were of mild intensity. All patients recovered. Further detail is

Patients with systemic hypersensitivity reaction were identified using a combined search of the narrow SMQs 
‘Anaphylactic reaction’, ‘Angioedema’, and ‘Hypersensitivity’ (MedDRA version 23.1).
1 A patient can be reported with more than 1 PT.
2 Patients can be counted in more than 1 seriousness category.
3 Intensity was collected with mild/moderate/severe categories for trial 1368-0011 and derived from RCTC grading for all 
other remaining trials.
A patient with more than 1 AE was counted once according to worst intensity or outcome.
Data source: data on file, analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘hypersensitivity all’/Randomised dose at Day 1: pooled arms, Tables 
A.2.1.3: 1 and A.2.1.3: 2
Trial 1368-0025 (entire treatment period)
Trial 1368-0025 was a single-arm spesolimab trial, therefore all events occurred in patients 
receiving spesolimab. 4 patients (10.3%) with hypersensitivity reaction were reported
(1 patient with the PTs ‘Application site urticaria’ and ‘Injection site urticaria’, 2 patients 
with ‘Rhinitis allergic’, and 1 patient with ‘Rash’). All events were non-serious, of mild or 
moderate intensity, and all patients recovered. There were no patients with DRESS (data on 
file, analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘hypersensitivity all’ and ‘DRESS’ Table A.2.3.1: 1, and 
1368-0025-16207-adverse-event-listings-final-20210310).
Trial 1368-0027 (open-label overall period)
There were no patients with hypersensitivity reaction or DRESS (data on file, analyses for 
EU-RMP v1.0, ‘hypersensitivity all’ and ‘DRESS’ Table A.2.4.1: 1).

SVII.3.1.2.4
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk groups or risk factors are unknown. There is a general risk for proteins to cause 
hypersensitivity reactions, with a potential intrinsic risk for spesolimab to induce a T-cell 
humoral immune response (see Section SVII.3.1.2.2).
SVII.3.1.2.5
Preventability
The preventability is unknown.
SVII.3.1.2.6
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
There is a theoretical risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to spesolimab. Treatment with 
spesolimab should be administered in a healthcare setting by physicians experienced in the 
management of patients with inflammatory skin diseases.
Currently, hypersensitivity is considered to have no impact on the risk-benefit balance of the
product.
SVII.3.1.2.7
Public health impact
No impact on public health is expected.
SVII.3.1.3
Important potential risk: Malignancy
SVII.3.1.3.1
Potential mechanisms
While there is evidence that supraphysiological levels of IL-36 can reduce tumour growth in 
mice, there is no evidence that normal levels of IL-36 are protective against cancer. Nor is 
there any evidence that IL-36 antagonism results in increased tumour growth. Finally, meta-
analyses of cancer incidence among patients that have received immune suppression therapy 
have not yielded a clear correlation between tumour incidence and therapies not intended to 
completely ablate immune function [n00265831-02].
SVII.3.1.3.2
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
Clinical data on malignancy associated with IL-36R inhibition is limited by both duration and 
number of treated individuals. In related mechanisms, meta-analyses of cancer incidence 
among patients that have received immune suppression therapy (e.g. TNFs, methotrexate) 
have not yielded clear correlation between tumour incidence and therapies not intended to 
completely ablate immune function [n00265831-02].
Like all immune modulating agents, spesolimab may have the potential to alter the immune 
response resulting in a potential risk of malignancy. A recent characterisation of individuals 
with homozygous IL-36R KO mutations revealed that normal immune function was broadly 
preserved suggesting that IL-36 signalling pathway inhibition does not compromise host 
defences; none of the individuals had cancer [R17-3632].

The role of IL-36 in tumour immunity is not well established at this time, but a theoretical 
risk of cancer from an IL-36R antagonist, though considered small, cannot be excluded.
A carcinogenicity risk assessment was performed. In summary, review of the scientific 
literature has not indicated that inhibition of IL-36R signalling increases the risk of cancer 
although the limited data available has indicated that increasing IL-36 signalling can be 
protective against cancer. To date, no evidence of carcinogenic potential has arisen in either 
non-clinical IL-36R KO mouse phenotypic assessments, or in repeat dose toxicology studies 
using the surrogate antibody BI 674304, or in clinical trials using BI 655130 [n00265831-02], 
see also Module SII.1.1.2.
The MAH is planning a voluntary PASS (1368-0128) to further investigate this potential risk.
SVII.3.1.3.3
Characterisation of the risk
Cases of malignancy were analysed using the following searches (MedDRA version 23.1):
 Malignant tumours:
o Narrow sub-SMQ ‘Malignant tumours’:
 Narrow sub-SMQ ‘Haematological malignant tumours’
 Narrow sub-SMQ ‘Non-Haematological malignant tumours’
 Malignant skin tumours:
o Broad sub-SMQ ‘Skin malignant tumours’
 Skin melanomas:
o HLT ‘Skin melanomas (excluding ocular)’
 Non-melanoma skin cancer:
o Broad sub-SMQ ‘Skin malignant tumours’ excluding HLT ‘Skin melanomas
(excluding ocular)’
 Malignancies excluding NMSC:
o Sub-SMQ ‘Malignant tumours’  excluding NMSC
Summary (indication GPP and other diseases)
Clinical data on malignancy is limited both by duration of the observational period and the 
number of patients. The occurrence of malignancies is rare and may only be diagnosed after 
years. In the open-label periods, no pattern regarding malignancies indicating a causal 
association with spesolimab treatment and underlying risk factors was observed in the 
patients concerned.
There were 2 patients with malignancies: 1 patient had a NMSC (PT ‘Squamous cell 
carcinoma of skin’) in trial 1368-0013, and 1 patient had a malignant tumour (PT
‘Adenocarcinoma’) in trial 1368-0025. This patient had rolled over from trial 1368-0013 and 
had a pre-treatment AE of enlarging pulmonary mass in trial 1368-0013.

In the supportive GPP and AtD trials (see Appendix 7), there were no patients with 
malignancies. In the UC trials, there was 1 patient with a malignant tumour (PT 
‘Adenocarcinoma of colon’) in trial 1368-0010. In the PPP trials, there was 1 patient in the 
placebo group with a malignant tumour (PT ‘Prostate cancer’) in trial 1368-0016.
GPP trials in patients receiving spesolimab 900 mg i.v. or placebo i.v.
Trial 1368-0013
Up to week 1 and up to week 12
There were no patients with malignancies up to week 1 and up to week 12 (data on file, 
analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘malignant tumours’, ‘malignant skin tumours’, ‘skin 
melanomas’, ‘non-melanoma skin cancer’, ‘malignancies excluding NMSC’ 
Tables A.2.1.1: 1 and A.2.1.2: 1).
By treatment period of spesolimab use (including REP of any randomised treatment or non-
randomised spesolimab)/overall period post use
1 patient had a NMSC (PT ‘Squamous cell carcinoma of skin’), following open-label 
spesolimab administration (i.e. after 2 doses of spesolimab). The event was serious (other 
medically important serious event), of severe intensity, and the patient recovered (data on 
file, analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘malignant tumours’ Tables A.2.1.3: 1 and A.2.1.3: 2, 
pooled arms).
Trial 1368-0025 (entire treatment period)
1 patient had a malignant tumour (PT ‘Adenocarcinoma’) in the lung. The event was serious 
(requiring/prolonging hospitalisation), of mild intensity, and the patient recovered. This 
patient had rolled over from trial 1368-0013 and had a pre-treatment AE of enlarging 
pulmonary mass in trial 1368-0013 (data on file, analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, ‘malignant 
tumours’ Tables A.2.3.1: 1 and A.2.3.1: 2).
Trial 1368-0027 (open-label overall period)
There were no patients with malignancies (data on file, analyses for EU-RMP v1.0, 
‘malignant tumours’ ‘Table A.2.4.1: 1).
SVII.3.1.3.4
Risk factors and risk groups
Malignancies are a heterogeneous group with varied risk factors, which can include 
according to the tumour location, genetic susceptibility, alcohol consumption, smoking, 
obesity, increased age, race, family history, exposure to chemicals or UV (e.g. PUVA 
treatment for psoriasis) or other substances, chronic inflammation, immunosuppression, 
infectious agents, radiation.
SVII.3.1.3.5
Preventability
Regular screening per cancer prevention guidelines should be instituted to enable early 
intervention in case of cancer. The preventability is unknown.

SVII.3.1.3.6
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
None of the reported malignancies were considered related to trial medication and there was 
no discernible pattern to suggest a causal relationship between spesolimab exposure and the 
development of the reported malignancies. All of the patients reporting malignancies while 
taking spesolimab had underlying relevant risk factors [n00265831-02].
Overall, malignancies are not expected to have a relevant impact on the overall risk-benefit 
assessment.
SVII.3.1.3.7
Public health impact
A potential impact on public health is not expected.
SVII.3.1.4
Important potential risk: Peripheral neuropathy
SVII.3.1.4.1
Potential mechanisms
There is no indication from the literature, that the inhibition of the IL-36 pathway is linked to 
an increased risk of treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy. Zhao et al describe that 
signiﬁcantly higher serum IL-36α and IL-36γ levels were measured in the acute phase (of 
GBS) than in the remission phase and in healthy control subjects (p<0.05), while lower serum 
IL-36Ra levels were measured in the acute phase than in the remission phase and in healthy 
control subjects (p<0.05). In addition, serum IL-36α and IL-36γ levels in GBS patients were 
positively correlated with serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels, while serum IL-36Ra levels were 
negatively correlated with the levels of these 2 inﬂammatory factors [R21-3672]. Spesolimab 
acts as an antagonist to the IL-36 receptor. BI is not aware of any other data that would 
suggest an association between peripheral neuropathy and spesolimab’s mechanism of action.
SVII.3.1.4.2
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
In preclinical toxicity studies with the surrogate antibody BI 674304, no histopathological 
changes were noted in the nervous system [c03320877-09]
Cases of peripheral neuropathy were reported in clinical trials with spesolimab (investigator 
reporting). After full integrated assessment by an independent external expert panel of the 
3 cases in ongoing clinical trials reported by the investigator as GBS, BI has concluded that 
there is no change to the benefit-risk-assessment for spesolimab. These cases showed a 
heterogenous clinical neurologic picture. Based on Brighton criteria [R21-3668, R21-3692], 
only 1 case met level 4 diagnostic certainty for the diagnosis of GBS (lowest level on 
Brighton scale of 1 to 4); the other 2 cases were also not assessed as GBS. In the case where 
lowest level of Brighton scale was met, the patient had an ongoing COVID-19 infection. 
Based on the available data, a causal association with spesolimab is not supported. The 
assessment was supported by an external expert panel.
No additional risk minimisation measures for the important potential risk ‘peripheral 
neuropathy’ are planned. The MAH is planning a PASS (1368-0128) to further investigate 
this potential risk.

SVII.3.1.4.3
Characterisation of the risk
Clinical trial data
3 cases reported by the investigator as GBS were received in ongoing clinical trials with 
spesolimab in different indications (UC, PPP, HS). The clinical course and symptoms of the 
reported cases were heterogenous and did not represent a common medical entity/diagnosis, 
and in all 3 cases confounding factors were present. Based on Brighton criteria (see below), 
1 case met level 4 (i.e. reported event of GBS, with insufficient evidence to meet the case 
definition [R21-3668, R21-3674]); the other 2 cases did not meet the criteria. In 2 of the 
3 cases, the investigator assessed that there was no causal relationship with spesolimab, and 
in one case, the investigator assessed it to be causally related. A summary of all 3 cases is 
provided below; additional details are provided in SVII.Table 5.
 Case 1 (reported in trial 1368-0017 in a patient with UC) was described as a
tetraparesis in parallel to a SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and evidence of cerebellar
haemorrhage and resulted in a fatal outcome. The SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and GBS
occurred >9 months after start of the IMP and 20 days after the last administration of
IMP. The patient was hospitalised and died 12 days later. The causes of death per
death certificate were cerebellar haemorrhage, oedema and dislocation of the brain,
and circulatory failure. This case was assessed by the investigator as not related to the
IMP.
 Case 2 (reported in trial 1368-0024 in a patient with PPP) was described as an
aggravation of pre-existing gait disturbances in a patient with a medical history
including unsteady gait, chronic alcohol use, and steroid-induced diabetes.
Approximately 7 months after start of the IMP, the patient was diagnosed by a
neurologist to have “sensorimotor neuropathy” after self-reporting unsteady gait. A
worsening of the unsteady gait led to hospitalisation and to the diagnosis of GBS
>16 months after start of IMP. No pharmacologic treatment besides thiamine and folic
acid was provided. Recovery was reported 3 weeks later despite continuation of IMP
and without GBS-specific treatment. This case was assessed by the investigator as not
related to IMP. Further, this case was determined by an independent external expert
panel to be consistent with ‘toxic neuropathy’ from alcohol use.
 Case 3 (reported in trial 1368-0067 in a patient with HS) was described as
paraesthesia and pain (for location and course see below) in an obese (BMI
>40 kg/m2) patient. The clinical course was subacute (>4 weeks from start of
symptoms to the worst clinical presentation and therewith not consistent with GBS)
with symptoms resolving without GBS-specific treatment and after discontinuation of
the IMP and no need for hospitalisation.
The patient initially reported joint pain (wrists) in September 2021, approximately
1 week after start of the IMP in the open-label extension trial and >3 months after
start of treatment with spesolimab in the parent trial 1368-0052, which were
interpreted by a rheumatologist as a possible carpal tunnel syndrome. In
November 2021, the patient reported worsening of symptoms with persistence of joint
pain, paraesthesia, numbness in the fingers of both hands and feet, and observed
muscle weakness, e.g. when climbing stairs or getting up from a squatting position.
Trial medication was discontinued on 15 Nov 2021. The patient was referred to a
Boehringer Ingelheim

Spevigo (spesolimab) 
s00088360-05
neurologist whose neurological examination at the end of November 2021 was normal 
aside from absent reflexes in the lower limbs. The patient was prescribed gabapentin. 
In January 2022, an electroneuromyogram was performed which was described as 
non-length-dependent polyradiculoneuropathy, probably demyelinating and 
predominantly distal. At that point, physical examination was normal, and symptoms 
had mostly disappeared. This case was assessed by the investigator as related to study 
drug.
The patient received COVID-19 vaccination (Comirnaty) in May, June, and 
December 2021. The patient had an episode of cough from end of September to 
beginning of October 2021.
Assessment by an independent expert panel
A panel of independent neurologists and experts in the study of neuropathies assessed the 
3 cases by applying the Brighton criteria [R21-3668, R21-3674, R21-3692], which have a
scale of 1 to 4 for the levels of diagnostic certainty (category/level 1: highest level of 
diagnostic certainty, category/level 4: reported as GBS, possibly due to insufficient evidence 
for further classification/with insufficient evidence to meet case definition).

1 of the cases (case 1) met Brighton category 4 (i.e. a low diagnostic certainty, with
insufficient evidence to meet the case definition). In that case, there was a coincident
infection with SARS-CoV-2, and cerebellar haemorrhage.
 The other 2 cases (case 2 and case 3) were assessed as not GBS.
All 3 observed cases showed a heterogenous pattern. A causal association with spesolimab 
for any of the reported cases was assessed to be unlikely.
A certain diagnosis of GBS could not be verified in any of these cases. The clinical course of 
GBS, which has an acute onset with patients typically reaching maximum disability within 
2 weeks but not longer than 4 weeks, was not in line with the described clinical course in 2 of 
the cases (case 2 and case 3). The non-specific symptoms and findings in case 3 may best be 
referred to as peripheral neuropathy.

Data source: COS [c38587917-01], Table 1
No additional cases of GBS, demyelination, or peripheral neuropathy were identified in 
patients treated with spesolimab in any of the other clinical trials in the development 
programme with spesolimab.
More specifically, results from search strategies using the MedDRA SMQs ‘GBS (narrow)’
and ‘Demyelination (narrow)’ did not identify any additional cases. When using the 
MedDRA SMQ ‘Peripheral neuropathy (narrow)’, no additional patient treated with 
spesolimab and 1 patient from the placebo group of trial 1368-0016 was identified. This 
patient was reported with peripheral sensory neuropathy starting on day 83 after first placebo 
administration; the AE reached RCTC grade 2, and the patient did not recover until DLP. The 
patient complained about numbness, which triggered an MRI of head, neck and waist; 
however, no clinical findings were noted by the neurologist and the investigator, and the 
reason for the numbness could not be identified (COS [c38587917-01], Section 5.2.1).

Preclinical data
In preclinical toxicity studies with the surrogate antibody BI 674304, no histopathological 
changes were noted in the nervous system [c03320877-09].
Literature
There is no indication from the literature, that the inhibition of the IL-36 pathway is linked to 
an increased risk of treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy.
The literature does not indicate an increased risk of GBS during the inhibition of the IL-36 
pathway. Zhao et al. [R21-3672] describe that IL-36α and IL-36γ may aggravate 
inflammatory injuries in GBS patients by promoting the secretion of IL-17 and TNF-α. 
Simultaneously, IL-17 and TNF-α may also interact to induce the expression of IL-36α and 
IL-36γ in GBS. Conversely, serum IL-36Ra levels were decreased in patients with GBS 
during the acute phase, and the serum levels of IL-36Ra were negatively correlated with the 
serum levels of IL-17 and TNF-α.
Discussion
In-depth review and assessment of the 3 cases reported as GBS by a panel of external 
neurologists and experts in the study of neuropathies assessed 1 of the 3 cases to have the 
lowest diagnostic certainty of GBS on the Brighton scale (category/level 4) and the other 
2 cases were assessed as "not GBS". All 3 cases showed a heterogenous clinical neurologic 
picture, and in all 3 cases confounding factors were present. A certain diagnosis of GBS 
could not be verified in any of these cases. The non-specific symptoms and findings in all 
3 cases may best be described as peripheral neuropathy. Data from preclinical trials and from 
the published literature do not suggest a potential risk of peripheral neuropathy for 
spesolimab.

Presentation of the missing information
SVII.3.2.1
Missing information: Pregnant or breast-feeding women
SVII.3.2.1.1
Evidence source
The potential toxicity of IL-36R antagonism has been assessed in mice using a mouse-
specific anti-IL-36R monoclonal antibody (BI 674304) which has been demonstrated to elicit 
pharmacological responses similar to spesolimab in vitro and to reduce DSS induced colitis 
in mice. BI 674304 has been tested in embryo-foetal and fertility and early embryonic 
development studies. There was no evidence of effects on fertility or embryonic development 
(teratogenicity) in mice after administration of 10 or 50 mg/kg/dose of BI 674304.
Spesolimab has not been investigated in pregnant or lactating women. Limited experience is 
available from clinical trial data.
SVII.3.2.1.2
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information
There are limited data from the use of spesolimab in pregnant women. Pre-clinical studies 
using a surrogate, mouse specific anti-IL-36R monoclonal antibody do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary measure, it 
is recommended to avoid the use of spesolimab in pregnancy.

SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR SPEVIGO (SPESOLIMAB)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Spevigo. The RMP details 
important risks of Spevigo, and how more information will be obtained about Spevigo’s risks 
and uncertainties (missing information).
Spevigo’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Spevigo should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Spevigo should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Spevigo’s RMP.
I.
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Spevigo is authorised as monotherapy for treatment of flares in adult patients with 
generalized pustular psoriasis (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains spesolimab as the 
active substance and it is given by i.v. infusion (concentrate for solution for infusion, 
450 mg).
Further information about the evaluation of Spevigo’s benefits can be found in Spevigo’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage.
II.
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO
MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS
Important risks of Spevigo, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Spevigo’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
-
-
-
-
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

If important information that may affect the safe use of Spevigo is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A
List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Spevigo are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Spevigo. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

General risk from proteins to cause 
hypersensitivity reactions. As the antibody is 
humanised, the risk for hypersensitivity reactions 
(including DRESS) in patients treated with 
spesolimab is considered low. Hypersensitivity 
events observed in trial 1368-0013 were not related 
to spesolimab treatment.
Risk groups or risk factors are unknown. Potential 
intrinsic risk for spesolimab to induce a T-cell 
humoral immune response.

Clinical data on malignancy associated with IL-
36R inhibition is limited by duration and number 
of treated individuals. In related mechanisms, 
meta-analyses of cancer incidence among patients 
with immune suppression therapy (e.g. TNFs, 
methotrexate) did not yield clear correlation 
between tumour incidence and therapies not 
intended to completely ablate immune function.

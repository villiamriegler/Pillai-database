1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Advanced Accelerator Applications submitted on 26 April 2016 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for LUTATHERA, through the 
centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 
November 2014.   
LUTATHERA, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/07/523 on 31 January 2008 in the 
following condition: Treatment of gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: Treatment of unresectable or metastatic, 
somatostatin receptor positive gastro-enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs) including 
foregut, midgut and hindgut in adults. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Lutathera as an orphan medicinal product in 
the approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: 
ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/Rare disease designation.  
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs) constitute a heterogeneous group of 
neoplasms arising from the diffuse neuroendocrine system. Well-differentiated carcinoid tumours over-
express somatostatin subtype 2 receptors (sstr2) which is a common feature of all GEP-NETs. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The worldwide incidence of GEP-NETs is increasing. In the US, a significant increase in the reported 
annual age-adjusted incidence of NETs from 10.9 per million in 1973 (Yao 2008) to 57.6 per million in 
2007 (Lawrence 2011) has been documented.  
The incidence of GEP-NETs can be estimated at maximally 3.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in the European 
population. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Carcinoid tumours represent the largest group of GEP-NETs (about two thirds). A long-standing 
classification system divides carcinoids into foregut, midgut and hindgut tumours, based on the 
embryonic origin of the tumours. Foregut primaries are located in the lung, thymus, stomach, 
duodenum, and pancreas; the midgut with primary tumours in the ileum, caecum and proximal colon; 
and the hindgut with the primaries in the distal colon and rectum. Note that some of these locations 
(e.g., lung and thymus) are outside the definition of GEP-NET (but not carcinoid), so the classification 
systems contribute to some confusion1.  
A more recent WHO classification system has been developed which is considered more clinically 
relevant. The current World Health Organization (WHO) classification specifies four subtypes

(irrespective of site of origin) under two main categories (well differentiated and poorly differentiated) 
and is therefore relevant for all neuroendocrine tumour types: 
Neuroendocrine neoplasm (well differentiated)  
• grade 1 (<3% Ki67 index)  
• grade 2 (3%-20% Ki67 index)  
Neuroendocrine carcinoma (poorly differentiated)  
• grade 3, small cell carcinoma (>20% Ki67 index)  
• grade 3, large neuroendocrine carcinoma (>20% Ki67 index)

Somatostatin receptors are members of the 7-segment G-protein coupled receptor family and there 
are 5 known receptor subtypes. The sst2 receptor is frequently overexpressed in neuroendocrine 
tumours, and is central to the mode of action of a number pharmaceutical agents including 
somatostatin agonists for control of symptoms in GEP-NET patients, and somatostatin analogues used 
as targeted delivery vehicles for radionuclides useful for diagnostic imaging or therapy. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
GEP-NETs may also be divided into functioning and non-functioning tumours. Functioning tumours 
clinically present with symptoms related to overproduction of biogenic amines and peptide hormones. 
The majority of GEP-NETs do not secrete sufficient levels of biologically active substances to induce 
symptoms and are therefore classified as non-functioning and consequently often present fairly late 
with symptoms of mass effects, or distant metastases.

2.1.5.  Management 
Therapeutic options 
GEP-NET  patients  with  early  stage  disease  are  often  asymptomatic  or  present  with  poorly  defined 
symptoms.  Consequently,  at  the  time  of  confirmed  diagnosis,  a  significant  percentage  of  GEP-NET 
patients have hepatic metastasis. Typically, the clinical management involves a multi-modal approach 
including  surgery  and  other  means  of  cytoreductive  treatment,  embolisation,  chemo-embolisation, 
radiotherapy and medical treatment with chemotherapy, interferons and somatostatin analogues. 
In  the  case  of  inoperable  disease,  neither  chemotherapy  nor  external  beam  radiation  therapy  are 
considered effective. Consequently, there are few treatment options, if any, with significant efficacy for 
patients with advanced disease. Most of the medicinal products approved in the target indication have 
limited application because they are only approved for use in sub-populations of GEP-NET patients.  
Like for other GEP-NETs, for patients with metastasized or locally advanced, inoperable neuroendocrine 
tumours of the midgut, treatment options are currently limited. Octreotide LAR (Sandostatin LAR®) is 
authorised  in  the  indication  ”treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  neuroendocrine  tumours  of  the 
midgut or of unknown primary origin where non-midgut sites of origin have been excluded”.  
Somatostatin analogues like octreotide or lanreotide should be preferentially used as first-line therapy 
in  advanced  intestinal  NEN  (midgut)  according  to  current  recommendations  of  the  ENETS4  and  other 
medical  scientific  societies  (ESMO5,  Joint  IAEA,  EANM  and  SNMMI  practical  guidance6).    These 
recommendations are  mainly based on the  PROMID  trial. As also stated in the SmPC  for Sandostatin 
LAR,  in  this  trial,  treatment  naïve  patients  with  histologically  confirmed,  locally  inoperable  or 
metastatic  well-differentiated,  functionally  active  or  inactive  neuroendocrine  tumours  with  primary 
tumour located in the midgut (or unknown origin believed to be of midgut origin if a primary within the 
pancreas, chest, or elsewhere was excluded) were randomised to receive Sandostatin LAR 30 mg every 
4  weeks  (n=42)  or  placebo  (n=43)  for  18  months,  or  until  tumour  progression  or  death.  In  the 
conservative  ITT  (cITT)  analysis  population  in  which  3  patients  were  censored  at  randomization,  26 
and  40  progressions  or  tumour-related  deaths  were  observed  in  the  Sandostatin  LAR  and  placebo 
groups,  respectively  (HR=0.34;  95%  CI  0.20  to  0.59;  p=0.000072).  Median  time  to  tumour 
progression  was  14.3  months  (95%  CI  11.0  to  28.8  months)  in  the  Sandostatin  LAR  group  and  6.0 
months (95% CI 3.7 to 9.4 months) in the placebo  group. According to a publication of the PROMID 
results  by  Rinke  et  al.1,  median  OS  could  not  be  estimated  in  the  Octreotide  LAR  group  and  the 
estimation of 73.3 months in the placebo group is not robust because of the low number of deaths. Of 
note,  after  progression  most  patients  received  a treatment  with  somatostatin  analogue  which  further 
biases the OS results for the placebo group.  
In the 2016 ENETS GL, it is discussed that even among patients with advanced loco-regional disease or 
distant  metastasis,  there  could  be  patients  with  non-functional,  low  grade  (G1)  tumours  with  low 
tumour burden and stable disease which should not directly be medically treated and “watch and wait” 
could rather be an option in such patients. According to the ENETS guideline, in such patients, i.e. with 
non-functional  tumours  (if  of  moderate  grade  (G2)  and/or  high  tumour  burden,  progressive  or 
symptomatic) and in patients with carcinoid syndromes, Somatostatin analogues are recommended as 
first-line treatment.

A brief description on efficacy data found for potential comparators in the treatment of pancreatic NETs 
is provided below: 
  Sunitinib  is  authorised  for  the  indication  “treatment  of  unresectable  or  metastatic,  well-
differentiated  pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumours  (pNET)  with  disease  progression  in  adults”. 
As  stated  in  the  current  SmPC,  a  pivotal  phase  3,  multi-centre,  international,  randomized, 
double-blind placebo-controlled study of single-agent sunitinib was conducted in patients with 
unresectable pNET (SUTENT). These  patients were required to have documented progression, 
based on RECIST, within the prior 12 months and were randomized (1:1) to receive either 37.5 
mg sunitinib once daily without a scheduled rest period (n = 86) or placebo (n = 85). Use of 
somatostatin analogues was allowed in the study. Forty-nine percent of sunitinib patients had 
non-functioning tumours versus 52%  of  placebo patients and 92% patients in both arms had 
liver metastases.  The median investigator-assessed  PFS was 11.4  months (95%CI:  7.1-19.8) 
for the sunitinib arm compared to 5.5  months (95%CI: 3.6-6.0)  for the placebo arm [hazard 
ratio: 0.418 (95% CI: 0.263, 0.662), p-value = 0.0001]. A blinded independent central review 
of scans was performed and showed similar results (12.6 vs. 5.8 months). Median OS observed 
after 5 years follow-up in an unblinded extension study (which was biased by crossed over to 
open-label  sunitinib  following  disease  progression  or  after  unblinding)  was  38.6  months 
(95%CI  :  25.6-56.4)  in  the  sunitinib  group  versus  29.1  months  (95%CI  :  16.4-36.8)  in  the 
placebo group, (HR 0.730; 95% CI: 0.504, 1.0507; p=0.0940). 
  Afinitor is, beside others, authorised for the treatment of “unresectable or metastatic, well- or 
moderately-differentiated  neuroendocrine  tumours  of  pancreatic  origin  in  adults  with 
progressive  disease”.  The  pNET  indication  is  based  on  the  results  of  the  RADIANT-3  study,  a 
phase  III,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind  study  of  Afinitor  plus  best  supportive  care 
(BSC)  versus  placebo  plus  BSC  in  patients  with  advanced  pNET.  As  stated  in  the  SmPC, 
patients  with  well-  and  moderately-differentiated  advanced  pNET  whose  disease  had 
progressed  within  the  prior  12  months  were  included  and  treatment  with  somatostatin 
analogues  was  allowed  as  part  of  BSC.  Median  progression-free-survival  (PFS)  based  upon 
investigator radiological review was 11.0 months (95%CI : 8.4-13.9) in the everolimus + BSC 
group versus 4.6 months (95%CI : 3.1-5.4) in the placebo + BSC group, (HR 0.35; 95% CI: 
0.27,  0.45;  p<0.0001).  Median  OS,  which  was  biased  by  crossed  over  to  open-label  Afinitor 
following disease progression or after unblinding was 44.02 months (95%CI: 35.6-51.8) in the 
Assessment report

everolimus + BSC group versus 37.7 months (95%CI: 29.1-45.8) in the placebo + BSC group, 
(HR 0.35; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.45; p<0.0001). 
Based on the results of the RADIANT-4 study, Afinitor was recently approved for the treatment 
of  unresectable  or  metastatic,  well-differentiated  (Grade  1  or  Grade  2)  non-functional 
neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin in adults with progressive disease. In 
the  RADIANT-4  trial,  a  total  of  302  patients  were  randomised in  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  either 
everolimus (10 mg daily) (n=205) or placebo (n=97).  Median progression-free-survival  (PFS) 
based  upon  independent  radiological  review  was  11.0  months  (95%CI:  9.2-13.3)  in  the 
everolimus  +  BSC  group  versus  3.9  months  (95%CI:  3.6-7.4)  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  pre-
planned  OS  interim  analysis  after  101  deaths  (out  of  191  required  for  final  analysis)  and  33 
months follow-up favoured the everolimus arm; however, no statistically significant difference 
in OS was noted (HR= 0.73 [95% CI: 0.48 to 1.11; p=0.071]). 
  Somatuline  Autogel  is  also  authorised  for  treatment  of  pNETs,  the  indication  states:  “The 
treatment of grade 1 and a subset of grade 2 (Ki67 index up to 10%) gastroenteropancreatic 
neuroendocrine  tumours  (GEP-NETs)  of  midgut,  pancreatic  or  unknown  origin  where  hindgut 
sites  of  origin  have  been  excluded,  in  adult  patients  with  unresectable  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic disease”. Details of the CLARINET trial are reported in the SmPC. This phase III, 96-
week,  fixed  duration,  randomized,  double-blind,  multi-centre,  placebo-controlled  trial  of 
Somatuline  Autogel  was  conducted  in  patients  with  gastroenteropancreatic  neuroendocrine 
tumours  to  assess  the  antiproliferative  effect  of  lanreotide.  Patients  were  randomized  1:1  to 
receive  either  Somatuline  Autogel  120  mg  every  28  days  (n=101)  or  placebo  (n=103). 
According  to  the  main  publication  of  the  study  results  by  Caplin  et  al  in  2014,  almost  all 
patients  had  stable  disease  at  baseline.  Median  progression-free-survival  (PFS)  based  upon 
independent  centrally-reviewed  radiological  assessment  was  not  reached  but  estimated  to  be 
≥22 months (95%CI: not estimated) in the lanreotide-depot group versus 18 months (95%CI: 
12-24) in the placebo + BSC group, (HR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.304, 0.729; p=0.0002).

As  seen  in  the  treatment  logarithm  above  and  comparable  to  GI  NETs,  according  to  the  ENETS,  at 
initial diagnosis, watch and wait could be an option in patients with non-functional pNETs (G1, low G2), 
low tumour burden and no symptoms.  
According to the current ENETS guideline on bronchial NETs7, there are several significant parameters 
that  differ  from  GI  NETs  which  need  to  be  highlighted.  Mentioned  differences  include  but  are  not 
limited  to:  a  higher  diversity  of  hormone-related  symptoms,  a  bronchial-specific  carcinoid  syndrome 
that  may  exist  even  in  patients  free  of  liver  metastases,  low  number  of  patients  with  distant 
metastases  at  diagnosis,  higher  prevalence  of  bone,  cutaneous  and  brain  metastases,  and  lower 
frequency of MEN1 syndrome. According to the ENETS guideline, current treatment recommendations

As  illustrated  in  the  figure  above,  in  typical  carcinoids  (in  case  of  residual  tumours  or  slowly 
progressive disease), one of the treatment options in some patients might be “watch and wait”.  
Therapeutic options in nuclear medicine Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy  
The biological basis for peptide receptor targeted radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is the receptor-mediated 
internalization and intracellular retention of  radiolabelled somatostatin analogues. For neuroendocrine 
tumours,  the  sst2  receptor  is  regarded  to  be  the  most  important  subtype,  as  the  receptor  density  is 
higher  on  tumour  than  on  non-tumour  tissue,  and  because  sst2  receptors  internalize  into  cells  after 
ligand (agonist or analogue) binding. Consequently, radioactivity delivered by the radiolabelled peptide 
is captured in the target cell after binding to the sst2 receptor.  
The first application for peptide receptor targeted radionuclide therapy (PRRT) of somatostatin receptor 
positive tumours involved the investigational use of  111In-pentetreotide (Octreoscan®). 111In decays by 
electron  capture,  and  emits  gamma  rays  and  Auger  electrons  which  can  destroy  cells  after 
internalisation.  
About the product 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  is  through  the  combination  of  site-specific  uptake 
(receptor  specific  binding)  mediated  by  the  peptide  portion  of  the  molecule,  and  the  (tumour)  cell 
killing properties of the radionuclide chelated to the DOTA portion of the molecule.  
177Lu-Oxodotreotide (Lutathera), is a 177Lu-labelled somatostatin tumour-targeted peptide receptor 
radionuclide therapy (PRRT) agent for the treatment of patients with somatostatin receptor positive, 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs). Lutathera being a radiolabelled 
somatostatin analogue has a high affinity for somatostatin subtype 2 (sst2) receptors. Oxodotreotide is 
comprised of the somatostatin peptide analogue Octreotate, coupled to the metal-ion chelating moiety 
DOTA radiolabelled with the beta-emitting radionuclide, Lutetium-177 (177Lu). Lutetium-177 (177Lu) is a 
β- emitting radionuclide with a maximum penetration range in tissue of 2.2 mm (mean penetration 
range of 0.67 mm), which is sufficient to kill targeted tumour cells with a limited effect on 
neighbouring normal cells. 
Type of Application and Aspects on Development 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
 
Lutathera is a radiopharmaceutical product indicated for the treatment of unresectable or 
metastatic, somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours 
(GEP-NETs) including foregut, midgut and hindgut in adults. 
The agreed indication is as follows: 
 
Lutathera is a indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well 
differentiated (G1 and G2), somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumours (GEP NETs) in adults. 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017  
Page 16/132 
 
 
 
 
Lutathera should be administered only by persons authorised to handle radiopharmaceuticals in 
designated clinical settings (see section 6.6) and after evaluation of the patient by a qualified 
physician. 
Posology 
Before starting treatment with Lutathera, somatostatin receptor imaging (scintigraphy or positron 
emission tomography [PET]) must confirm the overexpression of these receptors in the tumour tissue 
with the tumour uptake at least as high as normal liver uptake (tumour uptake score ≥ 2). 
The recommended treatment regimen in adults consists of 4 infusions of 7,400 MBq each. The 
recommended interval between each administration is 8 weeks which could be extended up to 
16 weeks in case of dose modifying toxicity (DMT) (see Table 5 of the SmPC). 
For renal protection purpose, a 4-hour infusion of an intravenous amino acid solution must be started 
30 minutes prior to start of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide infusion and maintained for at least 3 hours 
after administration.  
Treatment monitoring 
Before each administration and during the treatment, biological tests are required to re-assess the 
patient’s condition and adapt the therapeutic protocol if necessary (dose, infusion interval, number of 
infusions). 
The minimum laboratory tests needed before each infusion are: 
 
Liver function (alanine aminotransferase [ALAT], aspartate aminotransferase [ASAT], albumin, 
bilirubin) 
  Kidney function (creatinine and creatinine clearance) 
  Haematology (Haemoglobin [Hb], white blood count, platelet count) 
These tests should be performed at least once within 2 to 4 weeks prior to administration and shortly 
before the administration. It is also recommended to perform these tests every 4 weeks for at least 
3 months after the last infusion of Lutathera and every 6 months thereof, in order to be able to detect 
possible delayed adverse reactions (see section 4.8). Dosing may need to be modified based on the 
tests results. 
For information on the method of administration, please see SmPC section 4.2. 
For information of the preparation of the radiopharmaceutical, please see SmPC section 12. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction

(177Hf) with the most abundant β- (79.3%) having a maximum energy of 0.497 MeV. The average beta 
energy is approximately 0.13 MeV. Low gamma energy is also emitted, for instance at 113 keV (6.2%) 
and 208 keV (11%). 
Other ingredients are: acetic acid, sodium acetate, gentisic acid, ascorbic acid, pentetic acid, sodium 
chloride, sodium hydroxide, and water for injections. 
The product is available in clear colourless type I glass vial, closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper 
and aluminium seal as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  active  ingredient  in  Lutathera  is  lutetium  (177Lu)  oxodotreotide,  a  chemical  entity  containing  the 
radionuclide 177Lu, a gamma-ray and beta-ray emitting radionuclide.  
The  manufacture  of  the  active  substance  involves  a  chemical  precursor  oxodotreotide  (DOTA-TATE) 
and a radioactive precursor, 177Lutetium chloride. 
In line with the Guideline on Radiopharmaceuticals, a separate module 3.2.S is presented for the non-
radioactive chemical precursor. The ASMF procedure is used to provide the quality information for the 
chemical precursor.  
Two  suppliers  of  the  radioactive  precursor,  177Lutetium  chloride,  are  proposed.  A  complete  module 
3.2.S is provided for each supplier. 
A  separate  module  3.2.S  for  the  active  substance  has  also  been  submitted.  Due  to  its  radioactive 
nature, the active substance is not isolated. The synthesis of the active substance and its formulation 
into the finished product are  part of an automated  continuous process  which  does not allow isolation 
and testing of the pure active substance. 
Non-radioactive chemical precursor 
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  oxodotreotide 
(also  called  DOTA-TATE)

Figure 4: Structure of oxodotreotide 
Oxodotreotide (TFA salt) is a peptide. The molecule is cyclised through a disulfide bridge between the 
SH groups of the cysteines. The counter ion of the molecule is trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). 
The  structure  of  oxodotreotide  was  confirmed  by  performing  suitable  tests  and  they  have  been 
adequately described. 
Oxodotreotide is a white to off white powder freely soluble in water. It is not hygroscopic.  
The precursor exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of ten chiral centres.  Enantiomeric purity 
is  controlled  routinely  by  GC-MS  (Ph.  Eur.)  in  the  specifications.  Polymorphism  is  not  considered 
relevant since it is dissolved prior to incorporation into the finished product. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacture of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Oxodotreotide is manufactured by one manufacturer. 
Oxodotreotide is synthesized in seven main steps: solid phase peptide synthesis including DOTA ligand 
coupling and acetylation, cleavage, precipitation, isolation and freeze drying, purification 1 (linear 
peptide), cyclisation, disulfide bridge formation, purification 2 (cyclised peptide), lyophilisation of the 
bulk material, and bulk aliquotation, using well defined starting materials with acceptable specification.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  identification  (MS-MS 
sequencing,  molecular  mass  (MS),  identity  (IR),  amino  acid  analysis  (GC),  enantiomeric  purity  (GC-
MS), peptide content by amino acid analysis (GC), net peptide content (GC), assay (RP-HPLC), purity 
(RP-HPLC),  impurities  (RP-HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  counter  ion  content  (ion  chromatography, 
GC), water content (GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), and microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. A justification for specific 
impurities was presented and it is in accordance to the guideline on genotoxic impurities. The generic 
justification for any other potential genotoxic impurity based on the exposure is according to the ICH 
M7 and it was considered satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis data from 4 commercial batches of the precursor were provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
To evaluate the stability of the bulk after liquid aliquotation, stability studies were carried out on 4 
batches stored in borosilicate glass vials for up 24 months under long term conditions (-20 °C ± 5 °C). 
A 12 month accelerated stability study of aliquots at 5 °C ± 3 °C was also performed on one batch. 
Data was also collected from 1 batch stored in glass vials for up to 14 days at 25 ºC / 60% RH. Bulk 
aliquots were stored in upright and inverted positions. The following parameters were tested: 
appearance, mass spectrometry, counter ion content, water content, net peptide content, peptide 
purity, impurities, bacterial endotoxins, and microbial contamination. 
The stability data showed that no significant changes were detected under long term conditions. Under 
accelerated conditions, the aliquoted chemical precursor is stable in all types of tested containers for 
14 days, and it is stable under storage conditions at 5 °C ± 3 °C up to 12 months. 
Stability data from 1 bulk production scale batch of the precursor from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in polypropylene cryovials for 36 months under long term conditions (-20 °C ± 5 °C) and 4 bulk 
production scale batches from the proposed manufacturer stored in PETG bottles, borosilicate glass 
vials and polypropylene cryovials for up to 14 days under accelerated conditions (25 °C ± 2 °C) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters were tested: peptide purity 
and impurities. 
No significant changes in the quality of the bulk chemical precursor were detected under the conditions 
investigated. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Based on the 
results of the study, the peptide purity of the chemical precursor decreased after overexposure to light, 
indicating that it is photolabile. 
A stress test study using acidic, basic, oxidizing and oxidizing/basic solvents was performed on one 
batch. Results of the study showed that the chemical precursor remained stable in solution under 
strong acidic conditions, but is instable under all other investigated conditions.

The stability results indicate that the precursor (bulk or bulk aliquots) manufactured by the proposed 
supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months 
stored at -20 ºC ± -5 ºC in the proposed containers. The results of the accelerated studies show there 
is no issue should short term temperature excursions occur during shipping. 
Radioactive chemical precursor 177Lutetium chloride 
General information 
The chemical name of the radioactive chemical precursor is lutetium (177Lu) chloride corresponding to 
the molecular formula 177LuCl3.It has a relative molecular of 283.258 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Figure 5: Structure of lutetium (177Lu) chloride 
The chemical characterisation or elucidation of the structure is not necessary as it is a salt of lutetium, 
a chemical element. 
Lutetium chloride is a colourless or white monoclinic crystal soluble in water and has a non-chiral 
molecular structure. Polymorphism has not been observed. 
The  radioactive  material  for  the  active  substance  is  the  salt  177LuCl3.  It  is  presented  as  no-carrier-
added  solution  with  advantages  to  handling  the  solution  and  decreasing  the  effect  of  radiolysis, 
although the latter is not to be expected in a salt solution.  
Lutetium  (177Lu)  is  a  radiopharmaceutical  precursor  solution.  It  is  not  isolated  during  the 
manufacturing  process.  The  lutetium  (177Lu)  manufacturing  process  involves  dissolving  irradiated 
lutetium  nitrate  in  dilute  hydrochloric  acid  to  afford  an  intermediate  bulk  solution.  The  general 
properties  of  the  bulk  solution  directly  relate  to  the  (further  diluted)  lutetium  (177Lu)  chloride  in 
hydrochloric acid solution (0.05N). 
The relevant decay scheme for 177Lu and 177mLu is presented in Figure 4.  
Both nuclides are produced during the bombardment of enriched 176Lu (defined as starting material):

The  maximum  beta  energy  for  the  decay  of  177Lu  to  177Hf  is  0,497  MeV.  The  average  beta  energy  is 
approximately 0,13 MeV. 177Lu also emits several gamma rays useful for imaging. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
177LuCl3 is manufactured by two manufacturers. 
177LuCl3 is synthesized in 8 main steps: control of starting material, preparation of the stock solution, 
preparation of the 176Lu (NO3)3 target, irradiation of the target, dissolving of 177Lu (NO3)3 targets in 
0.05M HCl, formulation and dispending, sterilization, and packaging using commercially available well 
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
Being  a  sterile  medicinal  product,  each  batch  is  subject  to  a  sterility  test  according  to  Ph.  Eur.  The 
testing is performed after appropriate decay of the radioactivity. Such late sterility testing, however, is 
commonly applied to radiopharmaceuticals.  
The active substance is packaged in type I glass vials which comply with the Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The 177Lutetium chloride radiopharmaceutical precursor formulation process is based on the dissolution 
of  neutron  bombarded  lutetium  nitrate  targets  with  0.05N  hydrochloric  acid.  The  lutetium  nitrate-
sourced  radiochemical  has  been  manufactured  for  more  than  five  years  prior  to  process  validation 
using this basic formulation methodology. 
Process validation was performed in accordance with the approved protocols.. 
Specification 
The active substance specification for one of the manufacturers includes for the following components: 
Assessment report

Specification for the bulk solution of active substance 177Lu: radioactive concentration bulk solution 
(dose calibrator measurement). 
Pre-release tests: appearance (visual), labelling (visual), volumetric activity (activity measurement), 
specific activity (activity measurement), pH (potentiometric), chloride test (silver nitrate test), 
radionuclidic identification (identity 177Lu) (gamma spectroscopy, Ge detector), radionuclidic impurities 
(gamma spectroscopy, Ge detector), radionuclidic purity (gamma spectroscopy, Ge detector), 
radiochemical identification (identity iconic form 177Lu) (TLC-Plastic Scintillator/NMT detector), 
radiochemical purity (TLC-Plastic Scintillator/NMT detector), endotoxins (LAL). 
Post-release test: sterility (direct incubation in FTM and TSB). 
Test performed on annual base: metallic impurities (ICP-AES-MS). 
The active substance specification for the other manufacturer includes tests for: radionuclide 
identification (Ph. Eur.), radiochemical purity (ITLC-SG), radionuclidic purity (HPGe gamma 
spectroscopy detector), pH, specific activity (ICP-OES), chemical purity (ICP-OES), endotoxin (Ph. 
Eur.), and sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
has been presented.  
Batch analysis data (20 and 24 commercial scale batches respectively) of the precursor were provided. 
The results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Following the Guideline on Radiopharmaceuticals, the general stability guidelines are not applicable due 
to the very high radioactive nature of this solution. Any stress testing is not feasible. 
Stability data on 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from each of the proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial packages for 14 days under long term conditions at 
30 ˚C were provided. 
Considering  stability  data  is  available  throughout  the  proposed  shelf-life,  accelerated  stability  data  is 
not applicable. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, pH, chloride test, radiochemical identity, 
radiochemical purity, radionuclidic identity, radionuclidic impurities, endotoxins, sterility and metallic 
impurities. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Considering the lead container in which the product is stored, photostability testing is not applicable. 
Furthermore, inverted vials were also included in the stability study. 
No  formal  statistical  analysis  is  performed  because  the  data  show  very  little  degradation  and  little 
variability  with  the  exception  of  the  177mLu  impurity.  Test  results  also  show  no  significant  difference 
between vials stored inverted and vials stored upright. 
The stability results indicate that the radioactive chemical precursor manufactured by the proposed 
suppliers is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 11 days in the 
proposed container.

Active substance (lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide) 
General information 
The chemical name of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is lutetium(177Lu)-N-[(4,7,10-tricarboxymethyl-
1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododec-1-yl)acetyl]-D-phenylalanyl-L-cysteinyl-L-tyrosyl-D-tryptophanyl-L-lysyl-
L-threoninyl-L-cysteinyl-L-threonine-cyclic(2-7)disulfide (synonyms: DOTATATE or DOTA0-Tyr3-
Octreotate) corresponding to the molecular formula C65H87N14O19S2
mass of 1609.6 g/mol and the following structure: 
177Lu. It has a relative molecular 
Figure 7: Structure of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide 
The structure of the active substance has been elucidated by suitable tests and have been adequately 
described. 
The  radioactive  active  substance  is  produced  as  an  aqueous  concentrated  solution  (mother  solution). 
Due  to  its  radioactive  nature,  the  active  substance  is  not  isolated.  The  synthesis  of  the  active 
substance  and  its  formulation  into  the  finished  product  are  part  of  an  automated  continuous  process 
which does not allow isolation and testing of the pure active substance. For this reason, all the general 
properties described in this section refer to the mother solution. 
The active substance is an aqueous yellow solution free of particles. 
The  synthesis  of  the  active  substance  is  a  complexation  reaction  between  177Lu  chloride  and 
oxodotreotide.  This  reaction  does  not  have  any  impact  on  the  chiral  centres  of  the  peptide.  The 
characterization  of  the  chiral  centres  is  performed  by  the  supplier  of  the  chemical  precursor 
oxodotreotide. Polymorphism is not considered relevant since it is dissolved prior to incorporation into 
the finished product. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured at three manufacturing sites. The radioactive active substance is 
produced  as  a  sterile,  aqueous  concentrated  solution.  The  active  substance  synthesis  steps  are 
performed  in  the  self-contained  closed-system  synthesis  module  which  is  automated  and  remotely 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017  
Page 24/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
controlled  by  GMP  compliant  software  with  automated  monitoring  and  recording  of  the  process 
parameters. The synthesis of the active substance and its formulation into the finished product are part 
of  an  automated  continuous  process  which  does  not  allow  for  isolation  and  testing  of  the  active 
substance due to its radioactive decay. Therefore, validation of the manufacturing process of the pure 
active substance is not possible. 
The active substance  process  consists of combining the carrier ligand and the radiolabelled  precursor 
followed by sterile filtration. 
The active substance is produced in a shielded closed-system; manufacturing, purification and 
formulation process of the active substance are part of a continuous process. The decay of the 
radionuclide does not allow enough time for any interruption. 
At the end of synthesis, the active substance is collected in a sterile recovery type I vial in the 
dispensing isolator. 
Specification 
The synthesis of the active substance and its formulation into the finished product are part of an 
automated continuous process which does not allow for isolation and testing of the pure active 
substance. Therefore, specifications, associated analytical procedures, relevant method validation, 
batch analyses data and justification of specifications are available only for the finished product.  
Stability 
As already mentioned, the active substance is not isolated as it is part of an automated continuous 
process which does not allow for isolation and testing of the pure active substance. Therefore, stability 
is only available for the finished product.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile ready-to-use solution for infusion with a volumetric activity of 370 
MBq/ml at reference date and time (calibration time (Tc)).  
Calibration time (Tc) corresponds to the End of Production (EOP = t0).  
The finished product is presented as a single dose vial, containing suitable amount of solution that 
allows delivery of 7.4 GBq of radioactivity at injection time.  
Considering the variable injection time and constant decay of the radionuclide, the filling volume 
needed for an activity of 7.4 GBq at injection time is calculated and can range from 20.5 and 25.0 ml. 
The composition of the finished product: 
 
 
The active substance is lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide. 
The other ingredients are: acetic acid, sodium acetate, gentisic acid, ascorbic acid, pentetic 
acid, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, water for injections.

Natural decay of the radionuclide is a property of any radiopharmaceutical, whether it is produced 
industrially or in-house. Consequently, specific activity, total radioactivity, and radio concentration 
(volumetric activity) of the finished product change over time.  
The  applicant  developed  the  finished  product  as  a  ready  to  use  radiopharmaceutical  solution  for 
infusion.  Overall  manufacturing  of  the  finished  product  involves  an  automated  continuous  process, 
where the synthesis of the active substance is also part of this process. 
The  applicant  started  the  finished  product  development  from  an  already  existing  formulation  initially 
produced  in  the  hospital  radiopharmacies.  The  formulation  was  the  subject  of  an  investigator 
sponsored  phase  I/II  clinical  study  and  the  data  of  the  formulation  of  this  study  are  used  by  the 
applicant  to  support  the  present  marketing  authorization  application.    The  applicant  continued  to 
optimize the formulation by implementing some minor changes and designing the quality specifications 
and its manufacturing process, that consistently deliver the intended performance of the product. The 
final  formulation  has  been  used  by  the  applicant  in  a  Phase  III  clinical  study  which  successfully 
demonstrated the performance of the finished product. 
The  selection  of  the  excipients  was  directly  impacted  by  the  already  existing  composition  of  the 
finished  product  used  in  phase  I/II  clinical  trials.  All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards or in-house specifications. There are 
no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The primary packaging is clear colourless type I glass vial, closed with a rubber stopper and aluminium 
seal.  The  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured at three manufacturing sites. The manufacturing process of the 
finished product starts with recovery of the active substance  from the synthesis cell into the 
dispensing isolator, where it is diluted to reach the pre-defined radioactive concentration, sterilized and 
dispensed into primary packaging. 
The manufacturing process of the active substance and finished product has been satisfactory 
validated to demonstrate that a robust and reproducible manufacturing process has been set up 
successfully in the facilities and that the manufacturing procedures described allow production and 
dispensing of the finished product according to the release and shelf-life specification.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  mannerThe  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance  (visual),  identification  (RP-γβ-HPLC),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  of  gentisic  acid  (RP-UV-HPLC), 
assay  of  ascorbic  acid  (RP-UV-HPLC),  chemical  purity  (RP-UV-HPLC),  radiochemical  purity  (RP-γβ-
HPLC,  ITLC),  specific  activity  (dose  calibrator/HPLC),  filter  integrity  test  (Ph.  Eur.),  microbiological 
tests  (Ph.  Eur.),  volumetric  activity  (dose  calibrator/balance),  radionuclidic  purity  (-spectroscopy) 
identification (Ph. Eur.). 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017

In  addition,  specifications  have  been  defined  for  the  finished  product  to  be  performed  after  injection 
(microbiological test, Ph. Eur.). 
Free [177Lu] Lutetium ions may cause serve radiotoxic effects which is the reason why DTPA is used to 
chelate them in order to facilitate renal excretion. Considering the important role of DTPA for the safe 
use of Lutathera, i.e. minimising radiotoxic effects of free [177Lu] Lutetium ions, the DTPA content 
should be specified and the content tested during finished product release. Therefore, the CHMP 
requested that the determination of the DTPA content (sum of complexed and free DTPA) be added to 
the release specification of the finished product and it was agreed by the applicant. Because a test on 
DTPA was not intended by the applicant in the initial finished product specification the further 
development and implementation of the analytical method will be necessary in a two-step action. The 
CHMP recommended that: 
As immediate action: 
• The developed analytical method will be validated in all sites by end of November 2017 using the 
existing analytical equipment available on each site.  
• DTPA test will be implemented and performed on each batch starting from January 2018.  
• The test will be performed post-injection within 7 days after the end of the manufacturing process.  
In a second step, as intermediate action, the use of an additional HPLC system by his manufacturers 
for the determination of DTPA: 
• All manufacturing sites will purchase new HPLC analytical equipment and validate the DTPA content 
test method on the new specific equipment by the end of January 2018.  
• DTPA test will be implemented and performed on each batch starting from March 2018.  
• This test will be performed as release test and result will be available before dose injection.The 
analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for 250 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 18 commercial scale batches  of finished product stored for up 72 hours under long 
term conditions (25 ± 2 ºC) and under refrigerated conditions (5 ± 3) ºC and for up to 48 hours under 
accelerated  conditions  (32  ±  2  ºC)  were  provided.  Stability  studies  for  radiopharmaceuticals  do  not 
need to be in compliance with ICH guidelines. The batches of medicinal product were identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
A variable temperature stability (12 h at 32 °C and 60 h at 25 °C) study was carried out on 3 batches 
(one  per  synthesis  module/batch  size).  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  a 
higher  than  normal  temperature  for  a  short  period  of  time.  The  design  of  this  study  was  performed 
based on the results of the stability studies at 25 °C and 32 °C. Vials were stored at 32 ± 2 °C for 12 h 
and then moved to 25 °C ± 2°C for 60 hours. Test results after 72 hrs were compared with those at 
release.  
The container closure stability was evaluated on 3 batches (one per synthesis module/batch size). The 
objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  interaction  between  the  finished  product  and  the  rubber

stopper  to  guarantee  an  adequate  closure  of  the  vial.  In  this  study,  a  vial  was  stored in  upright  and 
inverted position for 72 h at 25 ± 2 °C. Results were compared with those at release.  
Samples  were  tested  for  the  same  specifications  as  for  releaseThe  analytical  procedures  used  are 
stability indicating. 
Independent of synthesis module, batch size and vial filling volume, the finished product did not show 
any significant changes whilst stored in any of the storage conditions tested for 72 hours. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  72  hours  from  the  date  and  time  of 
calibration stored below 25 °C in the original package to protect from ionizing radiation (lead shielding) 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
-   Because a test on DTPA was not intended by the applicant in the initial finished product specification 
the further development and implementation of the analytical method will be necessary in a two-step 
action. 
As immediate action: 
• The developed analytical method will be validated in all sites by end of November 2017 using the 
existing analytical equipment available on each site.  
• DTPA test will be implemented and performed on each batch starting from January 2018.  
• The test will be performed post-injection within 7 days after the end of the manufacturing process.  
In a second step, as intermediate action, the use of an additional HPLC system by his manufacturers 
for the determination of DTPA: 
• All manufacturing sites will purchase new HPLC analytical equipment and validate the DTPA content 
test method on the new specific equipment by the end of January 2018.

• DTPA test will be implemented and performed on each batch starting from March 2018.  
• This test will be performed as release test and result will be available before dose injection. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of octreotide were investigated in nonclinical PK studies in mice and 
cynomolgus monkeys after single iv administration. Multiple dose pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic (TK) 
data were obtained during the course of repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, and cynomolgus 
monkeys.  
Safety pharmacology studies were performed using the non-radioactive compound 175Lu-
Oxodotreotide. The studies were designed according to the ICH S7A Guideline and were in compliance 
with GLP regulations. All pivotal nonclinical toxicity studies were conducted consistent with 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Nonclinical Testing Guidelines and in compliance with 
the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations. Single and repeat dose toxicity studies were 
performed in rats and dogs.

In vitro pharmacology 
Somatostatin Receptor Affinity Studies – In Vitro Studies; Human Tumour Tissue 
There are five known human somatostatin receptor subtypes, hsst1-hsst5. According to cited literature 
(Table 3) octreotide compounds have been shown to bind to hsst2, hsst3, and hsst5 receptors. Based 
on the affinity profiles, octreotate derivatives have shown to have a higher selectivity for hsst2.

Cell Internalization – In Vitro Studies; Rodent Tumour Tissue 
Internalisation and retention of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide into sst2 positive AR42J cancer cells has been 
shown to occur in vitro (Study No. 20000420). In this assay 27.2% of the initial, decay-corrected, 
177Lu activity was internalised, a value quite similar to the positive control, 111In-DTPA0-Tyr3-Octreotate 
(21.1%).  
In Vitro Efficacy in Rat Tumour Cell Lines 
Anti-tumour activity in rat tumour cell lines is derived from the literature. Capello et al.9 compared 
tumour activity of a number of somatostatin analogues using an in vitro cell survival assay with the rat 
pancreatic cell line CA20948.  Literature cited data shown that cold Oxodotreotide, 177Lu-
Oxodotreotide, and 177Lu-DOTA were compared for tumour activity in an in vitro cell survival assay. 
The unlabelled peptide was shown to have almost no effect on cell survival, whereas 177Lu-DOTA 
(chelate without peptide), showed measurable cell killing activity, but was much less active than 177Lu-
Oxodotreotide. 177Lu-Oxodotreotide was compared to 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotide and 
177Lu-Oxodotreotide was found to be significantly more potent at all concentrations tested (at 
equivalent specific activities), and of the two, only 177Lu-Oxodotreotide was able to reach a 100% cell 
kill rate. 
In vivo studies 177Lu-Oxodotreotide 
CA20948 tumour-bearing male Lewis rats were administered a single intravenous dose of either 1.0, 
2.5, or 5.0 mCi/rat (4 to 20 mCi/kg) of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide or received multiple intravenous doses of 
177Lu-Oxodotreotide at 30-day intervals (3 repeat doses of 2.5 or 5 mCi/dose). Tumour regression was 
observed in both cases.

Figure  9:  Survival  of  tumour  implanted  Lewis  rats  treated  with  multiple  doses  of 
177Lu-Oxodotreotide 
In  another  study  by  De  Jong  (de  Jong  et  al.,  2001),  efficacy  and  biodistribution  of  Oxodotreotide 
radiolabelled  with  177Lu,  88Y,  or  111In  was  investigated  in  male  Lewis  rats  implanted  with  the 
somatostatin  receptor  positive  rat  pancreatic  tumour  line,  CA20948.  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  showed  a 
higher  uptake  in  the  tumour  and  sstr2-positive  organs  (adrenals,  pituitary  and  pancreas)  when 
compared  to  the  88Y-  and  111In  -labelled  peptide.  A  100%  complete  response  was  achieved  in  the 
groups  of  rats  bearing  small  (≤  1  cm2)  CA20948  tumours  after  2  doses  of  7.5  mCi  (277.5  MBq)  or 
after a single dose of 15 mCi (555 MBq) 177Lu-Oxodotreotide. A complete response rate of 75% was 
achieved  after  a  single  administration  of  7.5  mCi  (see  Figure  3  A).  In  rats  bearing  larger  (>  1  cm2) 
tumours, 40% and 50% complete response rates were achieved in the groups that received 1 or 2 x 
7.5 mCi injections of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide, respectively. A 60% complete response rate was achieved 
after 2 repeated injections (see Figure 3 B).  
It is important to notice that in this study a 40% reduction of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide kidney uptake was 
observed when animals received a co-injection of 400 mg/kg D-Lysine.

Safety pharmacology programme 
175Lu-Oxodotreotide: Behavioural Irwin tests and effect on body temperature following 
single intravenous administration in the rat 
In a GLP-complaint study, the effects of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide on neurobehavioral parameters and body 
temperature were assessed in male Wistar rats (8/group) for up to 24 hours after a single IV bolus 
administration at 0, 1250, 5000 and 20000 μg/kg (which is claimed to be approximately 40, 170 and 
700-fold the intended human dose, scaled to rat based on the body surface area).  
175Lu-Oxodotreotide had no effect either on behaviour or on body temperature at any dose level. The 
NOEL of 175Lutetium-Oxodotreotide was considered to be ≥20000 μg/kg.  
Evaluation of effects of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide on hERG current in stably transfected HEK-293 
cells 
The effects of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide on hERG tail current were evaluated in HEK-293 cells stably 
transfected with hERG-1 cDNA, using the patch clamp technique (Study 20100184PEHPPB). The 
vehicle alone (acetate buffer) induced a decrease of 12% in the hERG tail current while  175Lu-
Oxodotreotide at 10−4 M induced a decrease of 19% ± 2% in hERG tail current.  
Evaluation of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide effect on blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram 
and body temperature after single intravenous administration to conscious dog 
The effect of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide on blood pressure (mean, systolic and diastolic), heart rate, body 
temperature and electrocardiogram (duration of PR, PQ, QT and QRS) was assessed in conscious 
beagle dogs via a single IV administration. 
Telemetric measurements were performed on animals dosed at 0, 80 μg/kg, 250 μg/kg and 800 μg/kg 
of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide. No effects on body temperature or cardiac conduction times (i.e. PR and PQ 
interval duration, QRS complex duration and QT interval duration as well as QTc interval duration and 
QT shift using the probabilistic method) were observed at any dose tested. No arrhythmias attributable 
to 175Lu-Oxodotreotide was noted at any dose level.  
Following administration via a slow infusion (1.2 mL/min) at 80 and 40 μg/kg, 175Lu-Oxodotreotide 
induced an increase in mean, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure up to 6 h (at 80 μg/kg) or up to 4 
h (at 40 μg/kg). A reflex-mediated decrease in heart rate was also noted during this time. No 
arrhythmias and no effects on body temperature or cardiac conduction times (i.e. PR and PQ interval 
duration, QRS complex duration and QT interval duration as well as QTc interval duration and QT shift 
using the probabilistic method) were observed at any dose tested. 
In the second part of the study, beagle dogs (3/sex) were given a single IV bolus dose of 175Lu-
Oxodotreotide at 80 μg/kg for the determination of toxicokinetics and clinical signs. Two male animals 
(males) displayed diarrhoea between 3 and 4 hours post-dosing. No other clinical signs were observed.  
Evaluation of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide effect on respiration in the unrestrained conscious rat 
following single intravenous administration 
In a GLP compliant study, male Wistar (CHS DM) rats (8/group) were given single IV bolus doses of  0, 
1250, 5000 and 20000 μg/kg 175Lu-Oxodotreotide. The positive control was carbamylcholine chloride at 
0.3 mg/kg, administered by the IV route over 15 minutes via an infusion pump.

At 20000 μg/kg, a respiratory stimulant effect was observed on most of the evaluated respiratory 
parameters up to 30 or 60 minutes post-dosing: respiratory rate, peak inspiratory and peak expiratory 
flows and minute volume were all increased; inspiration and expiration times were decreased. At 5000 
μg/kg, less pronounced effects were recorded on peak inspiratory flow (increased) and inspiration time 
(decreased). No changes, compared to the controls, were observed in animals of the low dose group 
(1250 μg/kg). Therefore, the NOEL on respiratory parameters in conscious rats corresponded to 1250 
μg/kg when administered by the intravenous route.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Biodistribution of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide in normal rats 
Following i.v. injection in normal Sprague Dawley rats, 177Lu-Oxodotreotide was excreted rapidly 
through the renal system (Study 19990213). A biphasic decrease of radioactivity in blood was 
observed: the first, steeper phase had a half-life of approximately 15 min. In the slowly decreasing 
phase, the half-life was approximately 10.5 h (only a very small fraction of the injected dose was still 
present). The only organs with notable uptake and longer retention compared to other organs were the 
kidney (the compound is almost exclusively eliminated by the renal system) and the pancreas (which 
is known in rats to have high levels of sst2 receptors). The % Injected Dose/ gram (ID/g) of tissue at 
5 min after injection was 3.8 in the kidneys and 7.8 in the pancreas (and 1.6 % in the kidneys and 
10.6 % in the pancreas at 4 h after injection):

Biodistribution of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotide and 177Lu-Oxodotreotide in tumour bearing 
rats 
Octreotate and Octreotide derivatives have been studied in rodent tumour models (CA20948 and 
AR42J tumour implanted Lewis rats) using both 111In and 177Lu labelled compounds, derivatised with 
either DOTA or DTPA linked chelates. The biodistribution properties of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotide (1, 
4 and 24 h study) and 177Lu-Oxodotreotide (1, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72 h study) were assessed in CA20948 
tumour-bearing Lewis rats (studies 19980909 and 20000701) and are shown in Table 5 .

CA20948 tumour-bearing Lewis rats 
Excretion 
CA20948 pancreatic tumour bearing Lewis rats were given 177Lu-Oxodotreotide (40 microCi [1.3 MBq]; 
0.67 mg) by the intravenous route showed a similar biodistribution profile to the one observed in 
humans, except for the high uptake in pancreas and relatively high uptake in the bone.  Total 
cumulative activity excreted in the urine by 24 h was about 62.5 % (20.91% + 15.46% + 26.13%), 
and the total cumulative fecal excretion was about 6.1% (0.004% + 0.004% + 6.12%), indicating a 
fast elimination. 
Table 6: Excretion of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide in CA20948 tumor-bearing Lewis rats (n=5) at 
selected timepoints (Lewis et al., 2001). 
The only tissues besides tumour that have total uptake greater than 1% are the kidney, pancreas and 
bone, which account for most of the remaining uptake. 
177Lu-Radiolablled DOTA-peptides and Free 177Lu 
Radiolabelling of Oxodotreotide with 177Lu is very efficient but there is the potential that a small 
amount of free 177Lu3+ could be present at the end of the labelling reaction and has the potential to 
accumulate in bone with resultant undesirable irradiation of bone marrow. However, 177Lu complexed 
with DTPA is reported to be stable in serum in vitro and to have rapid renal excretion in vivo and 
therefore chelation of free Lu3+ with DTPA would prevent accumulation in bone and facilitate renal 
elimination.  Breeman et al.10 showed free 177LuCl3 had high skeletal uptake in the femur (primarily in 
the epiphyseal pates), with signi ficant retention in other tissues. At 24 h total whole body retention 
was found to be 80% of the ID, whereas it was 19% of the ID for 177Lu-Oxodotreotide. A small uptake 
of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide into bone (0.28% ID/g at 24 h could be blocked (to 0.02% ID/g at 24 h) by 
10 Breeman, W. A., van der Wansem, K., Bernard, B. F., van Gameren, A., Erion, J. L., Visser, T. J., Krenning, E. P. and de 
Jong, M. (2003). The addition of DTPA to [177Lu-DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate prior to administration reduces rat skeleton

pre-treatment with cold Octreotide) and was therefore thought to be somatostatin receptor mediated. 
177Lu complexed with DTPA was found to be rapidly eliminated through the kidneys with only 4% whole 
body retention of ID at 24 h. Additionally, free 177Lu3+ added to a preparation of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide 
could be readily complexed to DTPA in vitro and excess accumulation of 177Lu in femur, blood, liver and 
spleen was dependant on the amount of free 177Lu3+ present in the injected sample. The accumulations 
could be negated by the addition of DTPA to the sample before injection.  
Plasma protein binding 
The estimation of the unbound fraction of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide in rat, dog and human plasma by 
equilibrium dialysis method, at 300 and 1000 ng/mL were assessed in a protein binding study (Study 
BAN1116A27).

Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism studies have been performed with the non-radioactive 175Lu-Oxodotreotide 
formulation (containing 175Lu-Oxodotreotide and Oxodotreotide).  
Comparative in vitro metabolism studies of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide with freshly isolated rat, 
dog and human hepatocytes 
175Lu-Oxodotreotide formulation was incubated at 1 and 10 μM with freshly isolated rat, dog and 
human hepatocytes for up to 4 hours at 37˚C and analysed by LC-MS/MS in order to assess intrinsic 
clearance (1 μM) and metabolic profiling (10 μM) (Study AAA/01). Metabolite profiling analysis of the 
10 μM incubation samples did not detect the presence of any predicted or expected metabolites.

Assessment of the potential for 175Lu-Oxodotreotide to inhibit human CYP450 enzymes in 
vitro 
The effect of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide on the activities of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 
in pooled human liver microsomes was assessed at concentrations of 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 3 and 10 
μM (Study AAA/02). The inhibition profile of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide was assessed using both a 0 and 30 
minute pre-incubation period to ascertain whether any inhibition observed was reversible or time-
dependent.  
Direct inhibition (0 minute pre-incubation): Less than 10% inhibition was observed with all CYP450 
isoforms except CYP2C9, where the maximal inhibition was approximately 33% at 10 μM. All IC50 
values were greater than 10 μM.  
Time-dependent inhibition (30 minute pre-incubation): There was no decrease in IC50 values for all 
CYP450 assays tested (all remained >10 μM). 
At 10 μM, an increase CYP1A2 inhibition was observed, from approximately 5% to 22% inhibition 
between 0 and 30 minutes pre-incubation.  
Assessment of the potential for 175Lu-Oxodotreotide to induce human hepatic CYP450 
enzymes using human hepatocytes in culture 
The potential of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide to induce the major human cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes 
involved in drug metabolism was assessed in human hepatocytes (Study AAA/03). 
No cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations in the range of 7 to 700 nM.  Human hepatocytes were 
then exposed to concentrations of 7, 70 and 700 nM to achieve the expected human plasma 
concentration (70 nM) with a 10-fold lower and 10-fold higher concentration. In addition, hepatocytes 
were also exposed to multiple doses of omeprazole, phenobarbital and rifampicin (positive controls) 
and then assayed for various cytochrome P450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) using 
CYP450-selective chemical substrates and UPLC-MS/MS as the analytical technique. qRT-PCR analysis 
was also used to investigate CYP450-specific mRNA levels.

 The No-Observed Effect Level (NOEL) in the repeat dose toxicity study in rats corresponds to 1250 
μg/kg, which is 40 times the human dose. 
175Lu-Oxodotreotide was administered to Beagle dogs once every two weeks for 43 days (i.e. four 
administrations in total) at 0, 80, 500 or 3200 μg/kg via the intravenous route, followed by a 3-month 
treatment-free period to assess recovery.  
Toxicokinetic measures showed exposure to 175Lu-Oxodotreotide (AUCall) increased less than dose 
proportionally in males , but was dose proportional in females on Day 1.  By Day 43, exposure was 
proportional to dose in males but less than dose proportional in females.  No relevant accumulation 
was observed.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology studies have shown internalisation and retention of 177Lu- Oxodotreotide in vitro. 177Lu-
Oxodotreotide had a high affinity and selectivity for the sst2 receptor in the rat and in the dog animal 
models. The compound was specifically taken up by sstr2 expressing tumours as shown by Lewis et 
al.11. The uptake of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide lead to a significant tumour-free period in treated rats up to 5 
months after single dose administration and up to 26 months after multiple dose administration of 
177Lu-Oxodotreotide. Given the known biological activity targets of SSAs, no further secondary 
pharmacodynamics of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide are required. 
Safety studies of the cold compound (175Lu-Oxodotreotide) indicated no particular potential for the 
compound to cause prolongation of the cardiac action potential or increase of QT interval since no 
relevant effects of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide on the hERG tail current was observed. Furthermore, in beagle 
dogs treated with 175Lu-Oxodotreotide no effects on blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and 
electrocardiogram (duration of PR, PQ, QT and QRS) after single i.v. administration of 80 up to 800 
μg/kg (that is 10 to 100 fold the intended human dose, scaled to dog based on body surface area) was 
observed. However, 175Lu-Oxodotreotide showed to have a hypertensive effect associated with a reflex 
mediated bradycardia when administered intravenously, either as bolus (80, 250 and 800 μg/kg) or

slow infusion (40 μg/kg and 80 μg/kg). No neurobehavioral effects or effects on body temperature 
were observed at any dose tested (1250, 5000 and 20000 μg/kg) after a single i.v. administration in 
rats. A respiratory stimulant effect was observed on several respiratory parameters (respiratory rate, 
peak inspiratory and peak expiratory flows, inspiration and expiration times and minute volume) at 
20000 μg/kg (approximately 700-fold the intended human dose, scaled to rat based on body surface 
area) and some effects were also noted at 5000 μg/kg (approximately 170-fold higher than the 
intended human dose). 
Biodistribution of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide in normal rats showed that organs with notable uptake were the 
kidneys and the pancreas. Tumor bearing rats showed a similar distribution pattern compared to 
humans with the exception of the pancreas. Since rodents have high levels of sst2 receptors as 
compared to humans, a significantly higher uptake of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide was observed in the rat. 
There is relatively low plasma protein binding of 175Lu-Oxodotreotide. 
The pharmacokinetic studies showed that 177Lu-Oxodotreotide had a moderately short half-life in rats 
of ~10.5 hours.  Tumour tissue showed high uptake and there was also notable distribution into the 
pancreas, a tissue known in rats to have high levels of sst2 receptors.  Metabolic profiling detected the 
presence of five rat, eight dog and seven human metabolites. No human specific metabolites were 
observed. Excretion was mostly by the renal system and in vitro studies did not indicate any liver-
dependent metabolism although there was evidence of metabolism by kidney tissue.  There are no 
drug-drug interactions that are anticipated.  The proposed levels of the chelating agent DTPA in the 
final drug product are acceptable.  
Toxicological  studies  with  rats  have  demonstrated  that  a  single  intravenous  injection  of  up  to 
4,550 MBq/kg  was  well  tolerated  and  no  deaths  were  observed.  When  testing  the  cold  compound 
(non-radioactive  lutetium  (175Lu)  oxodotreotide)  as  a  single  intravenous  injection  in  rats  and  dogs  at 
doses  up  to  20,000 µg/kg  (rats)  and  3,200 µg/kg  (dogs),  the  compound  was  well  tolerated  in  both 
species and no deaths were observed. Toxicity with four repeated administrations, once every 2 weeks, 
of  1,250 µg/kg  of  the  cold  compound  in  rats  and  80 µg/kg  in  dogs  was  not observed.  This  medicinal 
product is not intended for regular or continuous administration. Renal toxicity was detected following 
a  single  15  mCi  (555  MBq)  dose  (~75  mCi/kg),  or  with  two  7.5  mCi  (278  MBq)  of  the  radiolabelled 
product.    Potential  renal  toxicity  has  been  discussed  in  the  product  literature  and  renal  protection  is 
also  addressed  by  the  administration  of  an  amino  acid  solution  30  minutes  prior to  administration  of 
Lutathera, which is acceptable (SmPC section 4.2).   
Mutagenicity studies and long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out, which is 
acceptable according to the relevant guidelines (ICH Topic S1A) where carcinogenicity testing can be 
waived, considering the short term use, the life threatening indication, and the use of radioactively 
labelled product in the clinic.. Non-clinical data on the cold compound (non-radioactive lutetium (175Lu) 
oxodotreotide) reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity. At the concentration used (about 10 μg/mL in 
total, for both free and radiolabeled forms), the peptide oxodotreotide does not exert any clinically 
relevant pharmacodynamic effect. 
As the product acts by delivering a dose of radiation to tumour cells, genotoxicity is likely where there 
is  internalisation  of  the  molecule.  Substantial  harm  to  a  foetus  is  expected  from  radioactivity.  , 
however,  the  product  has  been  contraindicated  in  established  or  suspected  pregnancy  or  when 
pregnancy  has  not  been  excluded  (SmPC  section  4.3  and  4.6).  Both  male  and  female  patients  also 
have  to  apply  contraceptive  measures  during  treatment  with  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  and  for  6  months 
afterwards (SmPC section 4.6).   
No animal studies have been performed to determine the effects of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide on 
the  fertility  of  either  gender.  Ionizing  radiations  of  lutetium  (177Lu)  oxodotreotide  may  potentially

have temporary toxic effects on female and male gonads. Genetic consultation is recommended if the 
patient  wishes  to  have  children  after  treatment.  Cryopreservation  of  sperm  can  be  discussed  as  an 
option to male patients before the treatment. 
An environmental risk assessment has been performed to evaluate the potential environmental risk 
resulting from the use of Lutathera. 177Lu-Oxodotreotide’s PECSURFACEWATER value (0.00131 g/L) is 
below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and it is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. A 
Phase II analysis of the physical-chemical properties and fate is therefore not required. Any unused 
medicinal product or waste material should be disposed according to local requirements (SmPC section 
6.4 and 6.6). As a result, 177Lu DOTA0 Tyr3 Octreotate is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.

The pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of Lutathera have been well 
characterised in the non-clinical aspects. The non-clinical aspects are considered to be appropriately 
addressed.

Lu-Oxodotreotide treatment arm) in order to define the pharmacokinetic profile of 
177
Lu-
Oxodotreotide. 
Absorption  
Biodistribution and excretion of 
177
Lu-Oxodotreotide was also studied in 26 patients with high tumour 
burden (7 in Group-2 and 19 in Group-3). Group-2 patients received 3.7 GBq (100 mCi), while Group-
3 patients received 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide. All patients received amino acid co-
infusion. The %IA of 
177
Lu-Oxodotreotide in the plasma after administration follows an exponential 
curve over time: 91% of the IA is cleared from the plasma with a half-life (Tα)of 24 min. In the 
subsequent phases the plasma half-lives are 4.6 h (Tβ) and 168 h (Tγ) corresponding to 7.7% and 
0.29% of the IA, respectively. The combined data (from Group-2 and -3) can be fitted with an 
exponential curve with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.993. 
The biodistribution of 
177
Lu-Oxodotreotide  has been determined by a number of methods in the 
NETTER-1 sub-study. Using image analyses, the majority of the enrolled subjects show the typical 
biodistribution pattern observed in patients treated with PRRT, namely a high uptake in the tumors, as 
well as uptake in the spleen and the kidneys (particularly evident in the posterior views), and, to a 
lesser extent, in the liver.  Time activity curves were also determined in the kidney, liver, spleen, rest 
of the body and in tumour tissues.  Residence times were calculated in the organs and were highest in 
the liver (14.6h) and rest of the body (21h).  Calculations were also made for the absorbed dose per

unit of injected activity (IA) (Gy/GBq) in the kidneys, the liver, the spleen, the urinary bladder wall, 
the total body and the red marrow.   
The %IA of 
177
Lu-Oxodotreotide as measured in the total body (minus the abdominal radioactivity) in 
Group-3 after administration follows an exponential curve over time: in the alpha phase there is 
uptake in the abdomen: 20%IA with Tα=1.9 h. In the subsequent phases the abdominal clearance 
half-lives are 38 h (T1/2) and 134 h (Tγ)corresponding to 24% and 1.8% of the IA, respectively. The 
%IA of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide as measured in the abdominal region (liver, kidneys, spleen and tumour) 
in Group-3 after administration follows an exponential curve over time: 53% of the IA with T1/2=1.9 h 
and 30% IA with T1/2=150h. 
The co-administration of amino acid was found to reduce the kidney absorbed dose by 47%. 
Distribution and Dosimetry 
To calculate whole body and organ radiation dosimetry of 
177
Lu-Oxodotreotide and to determine the 
dose to critical organs (e.g., kidney and bone marrow) in the substudy, full body (planar) and 3D 
177
SPECT scans were performed on the day of the 
Lu-Oxodotreotide administration, at different time 
points up to 72 h (or 168 h in case one or more images were skipped or not performed at the correct 
time). 
177
Biodistribution and dosimetry studies were initially performed in 3 groups of patients with increasing 
doses of 
biodistribution were studied in 6 patients following the initial dose of 1.85 GBq. The low dose of 1.85 
Lu-Oxodotreotide: 1.85, 3.7 and 7.4 GBq. The effect of amino acid co-infusion on 
GBq was initially studied in patients with a low tumour burden. The percentage of infused radioactivity 
177
(%IA) of 
Lu-Oxodotreotide in the plasma after administration over time follows an exponential 
curve. Without amino acid co-infusion, 75% of the IA was cleared from the plasma with a half-life (Tα) 
of 4.2 min. In the subsequent phases the plasma half-lives were 0.88 h and 7.95 h corresponding to 
19.1% and 5.03% of the IA cleared from the plasma, respectively. With amino acid co-infusion, 78% 
of the IA was cleared from the plasma with a half-life of 5.8 min. In the subsequent phases the plasma 
half-lives were 2.72 h and 55.1 h corresponding to 16.0% and 0.80% of the IA cleared from the 
plasma, respectively. 
All patients who were enrolled in the Erasmus MC I/II study underwent planar imaging to determine 
kidney dosimetry. Dosimetry was performed minimally after the first treatment to determine if the 4th 
treatment with 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide would result in a kidney radiation dose that would not 
exceed the 23 Gy threshold limit. 408 of the 615 enrolled patients had quantifiable kidney uptake, 
which enabled kidney dosimetry. Whenever possible, dosimetry was performed at first treatment, but 
dosimetry at treatment 2 or 3 was also performed in a few cases. In the same treatment, blood and 
177
urine samples were collected at different intervals after 
Lu-Oxodotreotide administration, and 
radioactivity measured at the investigational site. Urine samples were additionally characterized at a 
central laboratory by HPLC analysis according to validated procedures in order to examine the chemical 
status of the radionuclide in urine.  Overall, the results of the dosimetric analysis performed in the 
NETTER-1 dosimetry/PK substudy are in agreement with the findings from Erasmus Phase I/II study 
and indicate that the standard protocol for 
Lu-Oxodotreotide administration is safe. Moreover, the 
generally high and prolonged uptake of the radiolabelled compound in the tumor lesions observed in 
177
177
the NETTER-1 study, confirms 
Lu-Oxodotreotide tumor uptake data reported in literature, reinforcing 
the basis for Lutathera therapeutic efficacy in sstr2-expressing tumors.  To allow comparison with 
published dosimetry and toxicity data from various radiation sources (PRRT with 90Y and external 
beam radiation) and different dosing schemes, the biologically effective dose for the kidney 
parenchyma cells were calculated. The effective half-life (Teff) of the radioactivity to the kidneys for 
the 408 ´dosimetry´ patients after treatment with the actual cumulative administered radioactivity of 
Assessment report

up to 29.6  GBq (800 mCi; 4 times 7.4 GBq (200 mCi)) 177Lu-Oxodotreotide was 61±12 h (range: 27-
135 h) and the mean BED to the kidneys 20.6±6.0 Gy (range: 5-38 Gy). If all 408 patients would have 
received the full treatment with a cumulative radioactivity of 29.6 GBq, then the mean BED would have 
been 23.3±8.3 Gy 
The concentration of radioactivity in a bone marrow aspirate from 14 subjects was compared with the 
concentration of radioactivity in a blood sample that was obtained at the same time. The mean 
radioactivity in the bone marrow was 2.2±0.9 kBq/mL (range: 0.85-4.47 kBq/mL) and in the blood 
samples: 2.4±1.3 kBq/mL (range: 1.08-6.45 kBq/mL). The mean of the red marrow over blood ratio 
was 0.88 and therefore the radioactivity in blood can be considered as an indicator of radioactivity 
present in the bone marrow. The bone marrow radiation dose was calculated based on total body 
distribution (from whole body images and urinary excretion data). The mean dose per administered 
radioactivity to the bone marrow for the 5 out of 6 patients following the lowest dose is 0.070±0.009 
mGy/MBq (range: 0.054-0.078 mGy/MBq. The mean dose per administered radioactivity to the bone 
marrow for the 7 patients dosed with 3.7 GBq is 0.082±0.036 mGy/MBq. The interpatient variation in 
the radiation dose to the bone marrow was large, especially in terms of the contribution of the 
remainder of the body to the dose. The median bone marrow dose per IA was 0.022 mGy/MBq (range: 
0.011-0.126 mGy/MBq), with the largest contribution from the remainder of the body: 50% (range: 
31-92%). The data from all Groups allowed the calculation of the mean bone marrow dose, as the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed the combination of group data to be normally distributed; the mean 
dose per administered activity in the total of 29 evaluable patients in these groups is 0.049±0.036 
mGy/MBq. At an activity administration schedule of 4 times 7.4 GBq this would lead to a bone marrow 
dose of 4 x 0.36 Gy, in total: 1.5±1.1 Gy. 
Liver dosimetry based on planar image acquisition is hampered by the presence of (extensive) liver 
metastases, which are inherent to the clinical status of the enrolled patients. The consequence of 
taking the whole liver as region of interest, leads to an overestimation of the liver radiation dose. 
Therefore, the radiation dose to the liver was established from dosimetry measurements performed for 
patients with low tumour burden. The mean radiation dose to the liver in 5 patients for whom 
dosimetry data is available is 0.21±0.5 mGy/MBq. In patients dosed with 3.7 GBq and higher tumour 
burden, liver dosimetry was also determined using a ROI which encompassed only apparently normal 
liver tissue. The median dose in the 7 patients in Group-2 was 0.0163 mGy/MBq (range:0.012-0.12 
mGy/MBq). When the abdominal uptake measured in Group-3 (dosed 7.4 GBq) is assumed to 
distribute proportionally to the organ masses, according to normal man (liver: 1.9 kg, spleen: 180 g 
and kidneys 300 g) an additional radiation dose estimate can be obtained. The mean dose per 
administered activity of 2.0±1.4 mGy/MBq reflects the high dose resulting from the tumour 
metastases in the liver.  
The following conclusions on treatment with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide were determined from 
radiation dosimetry evaluations performed in clinical studies: 
 
The critical organ is the bone marrow, however, with the recommended Lutathera cumulative 
dose of 29,600 MBq (4 administrations of 7,400 MBq), no correlation between hematologic 
toxicity and the total radioactivity administered or bone marrow absorbed dose has been 
observed either in Erasmus phase I/II or in NETTER-1 phase III study. 
  Kidney is not a critical organ if a co-infusion of an appropriate amino acids solution is 
performed.

Overall, the results of the dosimetric analysis performed in the NETTER-1 phase III dosimetry substudy 
and in the Erasmus phase I/II study are in agreement and indicate that lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide 
dose regimen (4 administrations of 7,400 MBq) is safe.

Radiation dose to specific organs, which may not be the target organ of therapy, can be influenced 
significantly by pathophysiological changes induced by the disease process. This should be taken into 
consideration when using the following information.

administered activity for all patients with evaluable lesions 
Elimination 
The primary route of excretion is through the kidneys following an exponential curve with 70-80% of 
the IA eliminated in the urine within 48 h. Without amino acid co-infusion: 30.5% IA with Tα=50.0 
min, 62.4% IA with Tβ=7.5 h and 9.2% IA with Tγ=150 h. Concordant with the reduced kidney 
radioactivity residence time with amino acid coinfusion, the urinary excretion appears to be faster: 
45.4% IA with Tα=89 min and 52.6% IA with Tβ=51.2 h. Calculated doses to the kidneys were 
reduced by a mean of 47% (range: 34%-59%) by the co-administration of amino acids. 
With amino acid co-infusion, the kidney uptake is reduced and the kinetics of the radioactivity decrease 
in the kidney is faster: 31% IA with Tα=26 min, 13% IA with Tβ=2.7 h and 2.9% IA with Tγ=131 h. 
The mean reduction in kidney residence time by amino acid co-infusion is 26% (range: 3-42%).   
177
The 
Lu-Oxodotreotide that is not taken up in the tumours or organs is rapidly excreted in the urine 
with 67% of the IA within 24 hours.  70% is eliminated within 3 days with the remainder attributed to 
slow elimination post day 3. There is evidence of some persistence of drug in the body which may have 
safety implications however the current safety profile is reassuring. 
177
The aim  of the NETTER-1 substudy was to verify  that  the  dosimetry evaluations of patients receiving 
four, 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) treatments of 
Lu-Oxodotreotide are consistent with the dosimetric findings 
of Erasmus MC Phase I/II study. Additionally, the study examined the impact and clinical significance 
of reaching dosimetry limits to critical organs considered in the Erasmus MC Phase I/II study, namely 
the kidney BED of 38 Gy and the red marrow absorbed dose of 3.7 Gy.  
The 3 effective half-lives fitting the median values of the blood experimental data are: Teff1= 0.9 h, 
Teff2 = 3.2 h; Teff3=34.3 h.  Peak plasma concentrations are reported as 9.32 ng/ml.  AUC is 33.96 
ng.h/ml.  Plasma clearance is 4.53L/h.

Renal excretion is variable with values as low as 30% in some subjects and 90% in others, the 
majority occurs in the first 24 hours. Clearance values suggest the value is lower than GFR. Metabolite 
characterisation of urine samples appears to show minimal concentrations of metabolites.   
Figure 12: Cumulative injected activity eliminated versus time in the urine 
Patients enrolled in the NETTER-1 dosimetry substudy were found to have a mean radiation doses to 
kidneys of 0.65 ± 0.29 Gy/GBq of 
Lu-Oxodotreotide, and a mean radiation dose to bone marrow of 
177
0.04 ± 0.03 Gy/GBq. Mean total absorbed doses for these two organs were determined to be 19.4 ± 
8.7 Gy, and 1.0 ± 0.8 Gy after 4 administrations with a total activity of 29.6 GBq. Median doses and 
ranges of variability were 19 (5-35) Gy and 0.7 (0.3-4.1) Gy, for kidneys and red marrow, 
respectively, which are similar to those determined for patients enrolled in the Erasmus MC Phase I/II 
study.

Moreover,  the  mean  and  median  renal  and  red  marrow  doses  obtained  in  this  group  of  patients  are 
within  the  recognized  limits  described  in  literature,  and  are  comparable  with  the  findings  from 
published studies12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Biodistribution and PK data available on 5 patients with limited tumour burden, treated with 1.85 GBq 
(Erasmus MC Phase I/II study, group 1), 3.7 GBq and 7.4 GBq (Erasmus MC Phase I/II study, Group 2 
and 3 respectively) is shown in the figures below. In all patients the radioactivity cleared from plasma 
very rapidly, the percentage of injected activity decreasing to around 20% (in most of patients below 
10%) in the first hour after treatment. In all three groups the elimination profile in urine is also similar, 
with 65%-70% of injected radioactivity excreted in the first 24 hours (as shown in Figure B below).

treated with 1.85 GBq (Group 1) with those from patients with higher tumour burden, treated with 3.7

There is evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies that concomitant use of glucocorticosteroids could 
induce SSTR2 down-regulation and there was a trend towards more PFS events in patients 
concomitantly treated with glucocorticosteroids.  Therefore, as a matter of cautiousness, in line with 
the study protocol for the NETTER-1 study (version 3.0; pg. 50), section 4.5 of the SmPC should be 
amended to state that glucocorticosteroids should be avoided as preventive anti-emetic treatment 
because of potential receptor down-regulation.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The medicinal product is administered intravenously and is immediately and completely bioavailable. 
The recommended treatment regimen in adults consists of 4 infusions of 7,400 MBq each. The 
recommended interval between each administration is 8 weeks which could be extended up to 16 
weeks in case of dose modifying toxicity (DMT) (see Table 5 of the SmPC). The proposed dose is given 
at 8- 16 week intervals therefore accumulation is not expected. 
At 4 hours after administration, the distribution pattern of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide shows a rapid 
uptake in kidneys, tumour lesions, liver and spleen, and in some patients in the pituitary gland and in 
the thyroid. The co-administration of amino acid solution decreases the kidney uptake, enhancing the 
elimination of radioactivity (see section 4.4). Biodistribution studies show that lutetium (177Lu) 
oxodotreotide is rapidly cleared from the blood. For renal protection purpose, a 4 hour infusion of an 
intravenous amino acid solution must be started 30 minutes prior to start of lutetium (177Lu) 
oxodotreotide infusion and maintained for at least 3 hours after administration (section 4.2 of the 
SmPC). 
An analysis performed with human plasma to determine the extent of plasma protein binding of 
non-radioactive compound (lutetium (175Lu) oxodotreotide) showed that about 50% of the compound 
is bound to plasmatic proteins. 
Transchelation of lutetium from lutetium (175Lu) oxodotreotide into serum proteins has not been 
observed. 
There is evidence, from the analysis of urine samples of 20 patients included in the NETTER-1 phase 
III Dosimetry, pharmacokinetic and ECG substudy, that lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is poorly 
metabolized and is excreted mainly as intact compound by renal route. 
The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses performed on urine samples collected up 
to 48 hours post infusion showed a lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide radiochemical purity close to 100% 
in most of the analysed samples (with lowest radiochemical purity value being greater than 92%), 
indicating that the compound is eliminated in urine mainly as intact compound.  
This evidence confirms what has been previously observed in the Erasmus phase I/II study, in which 
HPLC analysis of a urine specimen collected 1 hour post administration of lutetium (177Lu) 
Assessment report

oxodotreotide from one patient receiving 1.85 MBq of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide indicated that the 
main portion (91%) was excreted unchanged. 
These finding are supported by in vitro metabolism data in human hepatocytes, in which no metabolic 
degradation of lutetium (175Lu) oxodotreotide was observed.  
Based on the data collected during the Erasmus phase I/II and NETTER-1 phase III studies, lutetium 
(177Lu) oxodotreotide is primarily eliminated by renal excretion: about 60% of the medicinal product is 
eliminated in the urine within 24 hours, and about 65% within 48 hours following the administration. 
Overall the density of somatostatin receptors in  SSTR2-expressing tumour  tissues is known  to be far 
higher than in the other organs of the body. The highest expression of the receptor was found in the 
cerebellum..  Patients  scanned  with  radiolabelled  DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotide  for  peripheral  tumours 
without brain pathology had no visualization of their CNS. Clinical practice shows that the main critical 
organs  for  possible  Lutathera  radiotoxicity  are  kidneys  with  a  non-SSTR2  specific  uptake  (via  the 
megalin-cubilin  mechanism  in  the  kidney)  and  bone  marrow  due  to  radioactivity  circulating  in  blood. 
Renal  uptake  and  resulting  kidney  toxicity  of  the  compound  however  is  largely  prevented  by  co-
infusion  of  amino  acid  solution.  However,  it  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  kidney  failure  with 
creatinine  clearance  < 30 mL/min.  Bone  marrow  toxicity  is  characterized  by  reversible/transient 
reductions  in  blood  counts,  and  lymphocytopenia.  There  is  no  particular  uptake  in  normal  tissues 
unless  they  are  affected  by  athero-inflammatory  diseases.  With  regard  to  endocrine  function,  no 
clinically apparent relevant effect was observed on pituitary-adrenal function.  
Somatostatin and its analogues competitively bind to somatostatin receptors. Therefore, administration 
of long acting somatostatin analogues should be avoided within 30 days prior to the administration of 
this medicinal product. If necessary, patients may be treated with short acting somatostatin analogues 
during the 4 weeks until 24 hours preceding Lutathera administration. 
There is some evidence that corticosteroids can induce down-regulation of SST2 receptors. Therefore, 
as a matter of cautiousness, repeated administration of high-doses of glucocorticosteroids should be 
avoided during Lutathera treatment. Patients with a history of chronic use of glucocorticosteroids 
should be carefully evaluated for sufficient somatostatin receptor expression. It is not known if there is 
of interaction between glucocorticosteroids used intermittently for the prevention of nausea and 
vomiting during Lutathera administration. Therefore, glucocorticosteroids should be avoided as 
preventive anti-emetic treatment. In the case where the treatments previously provided for nausea 
and vomiting are insufficient, a single dose of corticosteroids can be used, as long as it is not given 
before initiating or within one hour after the end of Lutathera infusion. 
The absence of inhibition or significant induction of the human CYP450 enzymes, the absence of 
specific interaction with P-glycoprotein (efflux transporter) as well as OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT1 and BCRP transporters in pre-clinical studies suggest that Lutathera has a low 
probability of causing significant other drug-drug interactions. 
The pharmacokinetics profile in elderly patients (≥ 75 years) has not been established. No data are 
available. 
The following conclusions on treatment with Lutathera were determined from radiation dosimetry 
evaluations performed in clinical studies: 
 
The critical organ is the bone marrow, however, with the recommended Lutathera cumulative 
dose of 29,600 MBq (4 administrations of 7,400 MBq), no correlation between hematologic 
toxicity and the total radioactivity administered or bone marrow absorbed dose has been 
observed either in Erasmus phase I/II or in NETTER-1 phase III study.

  Kidney is not a critical organ if a co-infusion of an appropriate amino acids solution is 
performed.

The applicant did not submit dose-response studies.  
In  2000,  the  Erasmus  Medical  Center  (EMC)  phase  I/II  study  allowed  treatment  of  a  heterogenous 
group  of  patients  with  somatostatin  receptor  positive  tumours  with  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  on  a 
compassionate use basis. 1,214 patients with various somatostatin receptor-positive tumour types (the 
majority GEP-NETs) were enrolled between January 2000 and December 2012. The EMC study enrolled 
national (Dutch, 60%) and non-national (40%) patients. 
In  2012,  there  was  an  independent  assessment  conducted  for  study  EMC  phase  I/II  study.  Initial 
estimates  of  the  maximum  safe  dose  of  the  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  were  derived  from  initial 
biodistribution  and  dosimetry  studies  in  the  EMC  phase  I/II  trial.  The  dose  was  discussed  during  a 
CHMP SA (2008) and the applicant was advised to explore dose-finding further.  The proposed dosing 
regimen  and  dose  modification  protocol  was  agreed  with  in  the  CHMP  scientific  advice  in  December 
2010.

2.5.2.  Main study 
NETTER-1: A multicentre, stratified, open, randomized, comparator-
controlled, parallel-group phase III study comparing treatment with 177Lu-
Oxodotreotide to Octreotide LAR in patients with inoperable, progressive, 
somatostatin receptor positive, midgut carcinoid tumours 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The  target  population  comprised  of  adult  patients  with  inoperable,  progressive,  OctreoScan  positive, 
well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours of the small  bowel (midgut carcinoid tumours), who were 
treated  with  20  mg  or  30  mg  Octreotide  LAR  every  3-4  weeks  at  a  fixed  dose  for  at  least  12  weeks 
prior to randomization in the study. 
Main key inclusion criteria: 
 
Presence  of  metastasized  or  locally  advanced,  inoperable  (curative  intent)  at  randomization 
time, histologically proven, midgut carcinoid tumour (to be centrally confirmed). 
  Ki67 index ≤ 20% (to be centrally confirmed). 
 
Patients  on  Octreotide  LAR  at  a  fixed  dose  of  20  mg  or  30  mg  at  3-4  weeks  intervals  for  at 
 
 
least 12 weeks prior to randomization in the study. 
Patients ≥18 years of age. 
Patients had to have progressive disease based on RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1 while receiving 
an uninterrupted fixed dose of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks). Disease progression had 
to  be  centrally  confirmed.  In  order  to  make  the  assessment,  two  CT  (or  MRI)  scans  were 
required. The oldest scan must not be older than 3 years from the date of randomization. The 
most recent scan must not be older than 4 weeks from the date of randomization. Both scans 
must  have  been  obtained  while  the  patient  was  receiving  the  same  fixed  dose  of  Octreotide 
LAR 
(20-30  mg/3-4  weeks)  with  the  following  exceptions;  1)  it  was  acceptable  if  the  oldest  scan 
was obtained within 12 weeks of the patient receiving a fixed dose regimen of Octreotide LAR 
(20-30  mg/3-4  weeks);  AND  2)  it  was  acceptable  for  either  scan  to  be  obtained  before  or 
during  the  time  a  patient  receiving  a  fixed  dose  of  Octreotide  LAR  has  switched  to  an 
equivalent dose of short acting Octreotide for up to 6 weeks in order to obtain an OctreoScan, 
provided that the Octreotide LAR fixed dose resumed after the OctreoScan. 
  Confirmed  presence  of  somatostatin  receptors  on  all  target  lesions  (RECIST  Criteria,  Version 
1.1)  documented  by  CT/MRI  scans,  based  on  positive  OctreoScan  imaging  within  24  weeks 
prior to randomization in the study (to be centrally confirmed). The OctreoScan should be one 
that was performed while the patient was on a fixed  dose of Octreotide LAR. If a patient has 
had an OctreoScan performed while Octreotide LAR treatment-naïve, the patient must have a 
repeat OctreoScan performed after 3 months of Octreotide LAR treatments before entering the 
clinical study to prove that the index lesions or new lesions still meet the criteria for inclusion. 
It  is  acceptable  to  have  patients  temporarily  switched  from  Octreotide  LAR  to  Octreotide  s.c.

Treatments 
After the screening period, patients randomised were randomly assigned to treatment with 177Lu-
Oxodotreotide (Lutathera) arm or the Octreotide LAR arm. 
Lutathera Arm: 
Treatment with 177Lu-Oxodotreotide (Lutathera) consisted of 4 administrations of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide 
7.4 GBq at 8±1-week intervals or up to 16 weeks to accommodate resolving acute toxicity (total 
cumulative radioactivity of 29.6 GBq (800 mCi)). For kidney protection, an amino acid solution was 
administered concomitantly.  
In addition, patients received supportive care with 30 mg Octreotide LAR every 4 weeks ± 3 days until 
the PFS primary end-point, then until Week 72 from randomisation after the PFS primary end-point, or 
early termination, unless the patient progressed or died. 
The scheme for dose modification after toxicity in the 177Lu-Oxodotreotide treatment arm is presented 
in the figure below.

Figure 17: Dose Modifying Schemes for 177Lu-Oxodotreotide Treatment Arm 
Comparator Arm:  
Patients in the comparator arm received 60 mg Octreotide LAR every 4 weeks (i.m. injections) ± 3 
days until the final overall analysis of PFS, unless the patient progressed or died. After the final PFS 
analysis, the treatment/assessment period for each patient became fixed and all patients received 60 
mg for a maximum of 72 weeks and then proceeded to the long-term follow-up assessment phase for 
evaluation of survival. 
Concomitant and Rescue Medication 
 
In  the  Lutathera  arm  only:  30  mg  Octreotide  LAR  treatment  for  symptoms  control  administered 
until the final overall analysis of, unless the patient progressed or died. After the final PFS analysis, 
the treatment/assessment period became fixed and all patients received 30 mg for a maximum of 
72  weeks  and  then  proceeded  to  the  long-term  follow-up  assessment  phase  for  evaluation  of 
survival and long term toxicities. 
 
In the Lutathera arm only: amino acid infusion (Vamin 18 in Europe and Aminosyn II 10% in USA) 
was given concomitantly with each administration of Lutathera for kidney protection. 
 
In  both  arms:  in  case  patients  experienced  clinical  symptoms  (i.e.  diarrhoea  and  flushing) 
associated with their carcinoid tumours, Octreotide s.c. rescue injections were allowed.  
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To compare Progression Free Survival (PFS) after treatment with 177Lu-Oxodotreotide plus best 
supportive care (30 mg Octreotide LAR) to treatment with high dose (60 mg) Octreotide LAR in 
patients with inoperable, progressive, somatostatin receptor positive, well-differentiated 
neuroendocrine tumours of the small bowel (midgut carcinoid tumours). 
Secondary objectives were:  
 
 
To compare the Objective Response Rate (ORR) between the two study arms;  
To compare the Overall Survival (OS) between the two study arms;  
Assessment report

 
 
 
To compare the Time to Tumour Progression (TTP) between the two study arms;  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide;  
To  evaluate  the  health  related  quality  of  life  (QoL)  as  measured  by  the  EORTC  QLQ-30  and 
G.I.NET21 questionnaire;  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy end-point was PFS as measured by objective tumour response, which was 
determined by RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1. 
PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to documented progression according to 
RECIST Criteria or death due to any cause, as evaluated by the Independent Review Committee, within 
76 weeks of start of study treatment. Patients, who drop out due to toxicity and who therefore cannot 
receive the full treatment are included as having disease progression. If a patient has no progression 
and has not died, the patient will be regarded as censored in the context of a time to event analysis at 
the date of last adequate tumour assessment. An Independent Image Reading Center (IRC) was to 
carry out centralised confirmation of disease progression. In case of discrepancies on the evaluation of 
the progressive status between investigator and central assessor, a third evaluator performed 
adjudication.  The adjudicator did not have access to the local evaluation, only to the first central 
assessment. The censoring rules are defined below. 
Table 18: Censoring rules definition for evaluation of PFS 
The secondary efficacy variables were: 
  Objective Response Rate (ORR): Objective Response Rate (ORR) will be calculated as the 
proportion of patients with tumour size reduction of a predefined amount (the sum of partial 
responses (PR) plus complete responses (CR)) and for a minimum time period. Response duration 
will be calculated from the time of initial response until documented tumour progression. 
  Overall Survival (OS): Overall Survival (OS) will be calculated from start of study treatment until 
the day of death due to any cause; OS will not be censored if a patient receives other anti-tumour 
treatments after study medication. Survival data will be collected at the End of Study and up to 3 
years after the End of Study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017  
Page 58/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Time to Tumour Progression (TTP): TTP is defined as the time (number of days) from start of study 
treatment to objective  tumour progression. It includes patients who drop out due to toxicity, but 
omits  patients  who  die  without  measured  progression  (censored  to  last  follow-up  date  or  death 
date). 
  Duration  of  Response  (DoR):  The  duration  of  overall  response  is  measured  from  the  time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent  or  progressive  disease  is  objectively  documented  (taking  as  reference  for  progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded on study). The duration of overall complete response 
is  measured  from  the  time  measurement  criteria  are  first  met  for  CR  until  the  first  date  that 
recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
  QoL: The impact of treatment on health related QoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and 
the EORTC QLQ-G.I.NET21 questionnaires, which was filled in by the patient prior to knowing the 
CT  scan/MRI  result.  Changes  from  baseline  were  assessed  every  12±1  week  from  the  first 
treatment date until the PFS primary end-point, then until week 72 after randomization, unless the 
patient progressed or died. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality 
of  life  of  cancer  patients. The  EORTC  QLQ-G.I.NET21  questionnaire  is  a  supplemental  module  for 
carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumours. This module comprises questions assessing disease symptoms, 
side effects  of  treatment, body  image,  disease  related  worries,  social  functioning,  communication 
and sexuality. 
Outcomes for both study arms were collected and evaluated in relation to objective tumour response, 
KPS, and other parameters of clinical relevance. 
Safety was assessed on the basis of adverse events (AEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), 
laboratory results for haematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis, physical examinations, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), Karnofsky performance score (KPS). 
Safety  assessment  in  both  arms  was  performed  every  12±1  weeks  from  the  randomization  date.  All 
adverse  events  (AEs),  whether  or  not  spontaneously  reported  by  the  patient,  were  recorded  starting 
from the signing of the ICF until the last study-related visit. Furthermore, a DSMB evaluated patient’s 
safety  throughout  the  study.  Please  be  referred  to  section  4  on  clinical  safety  for  a  detailed 
assessment.  
Handling of missing data 
Missing values were not replaced for the main calculation of the primary variable and secondary 
parameters (including key secondary parameters [OS, TTP and ORR]). 
If relevant (e.g. the number of missing values is found to be substantial during the blind review), an 
investigation was performed to determine how sensitive the results were to the method of handling 
missing values, at least for the primary variable and key secondary parameters. No replacement was 
applied to any descriptive analysis or listings. 
Sample size 
Sample size was calculated using the POWER Procedure Log-Rank Test for Two Survival Curves (SAS 
9.2) based on the following assumptions:  
  Median PFS for control arm: 14 months  
  Median PFS for 177Lu-Oxodotreotide arm: 30 months  
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017  
Page 59/132 
 
 
 
 
  Nominal Power: 90%  
  Alpha: 0.05  
 
 
Pre-defined accrual period: 18 months  
Follow-up period: 18 months  
A sample size of 124 patients with a number of 74 events (disease progression centrally confirmed or 
death due to any cause) was needed.  
However, the sample size was also adjusted for overall survival (secondary end-point) with the 
following assumptions:  
  Median OS for control arm: 32 months  
  Median OS for 177Lu-Oxodotreotide arm: 50 months  
  Nominal power: 80%  
  Alpha: 0.05  
 
 
Pre-defined accrual period: 18 months  
Long term follow-up: 60 months  
Based  on  these  criteria,  the  study  would  need  to  randomize  124  patients  (62  per  arm),  and  would 
observe  74  PFS  events  during  the  course  of  the  study.  Therefore,  the  PFS  primary  analysis  point 
occurs  when  there  are  74  evaluable  and  centrally  confirmed  disease  progressions  or  death  events  in 
the  study.    Sample  size  was  adjusted  to  allow  for  a  20%  drop-out  rate  and  to  allow  detection  of  a 
statistically significant and clinically relevant difference  in OS between the two treatment arms (80% 
power).  
Randomisation 
After the screening period, patients were randomly assigned to the 177Lu-Oxodotreotide arm or the 
Octreotide LAR arm. Patient randomisation has been performed according to a centralized permuted 
block randomisation scheme with a balanced ratio (1:1) between the two treatment arms, stratified by 
OctreoScan tumour uptake score (Grade 2, 3 and 4) and by the length of time that a patient has been 
on constant dose of Octreotide (≤ 6 and > 6 months). Randomisation was implemented via the 
Interactive Web-based Response System (IWRS). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was designed as open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis populations were defined for the study analyses: 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The Full Analysis Set consisted of all patients randomised. Following the intent-
to-treat  principle,  patients  were  analysed  according  to  the  treatment  they  were  assigned  at 
randomisation. 
Per  Protocol  Set  (PPS):  The  Per  Protocol  Set  (PPS)  consisted  of  all  randomised  patients,  who  had  no 
major protocol violations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017  
Page 60/132 
 
 
 
 
Safety Set (SAF): The Safety Set (SAF) consisted of all randomised patients, who received at least one 
dose of study drug. Patients were analysed according to treatment received. 
The FAS was used for all analyses of efficacy, demographics and baseline characteristics. The PPS was 
used  for  the  per-protocol  analyses  of  primary  objective  and  key  secondary  variables.  The  safety  set 
was for all safety analyses. 
Analysis methods 
Primary analysis 
 
The final primary analysis on the PFS was performed after the planned number of 74 evaluable and 
centrally confirmed PFS events or deaths was achieved. The unstratified log-rank test was used to 
compare  the  PFS  between  the  two  treatment  groups.  The  median  point  estimate  and  95% 
Confidence  Interval  (CI)  for  the  PFS  was  provided  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method.  The  primary 
efficacy analysis was conducted on the FAS and additionally for the PPS.  
 
The impact of selected covariates on the estimated hazard ratio for PFS was assessed by means of 
a cox proportional hazards model. The model was first fitted with a binary indicator for randomized 
treatment and all covariates that may potentially influence PFS. A step-down procedure was used 
to eliminate covariates (other than treatment) that do not reach a significance level of 0.05. 
Secondary analyses 
  Response  rates  and  95% CIs  was  calculated  for  the  ORR  by  treatment group.  Frequencies  in the 
two treatment groups were compared by Fisher’s exact test. 
 
The  median  and  95%  Confidence  Interval  (CI)  for  OS  was  estimated  using the  KM  method.    The 
unstratified log-rank test was used to compare OS between the two groups. 
Inferential  statistics  were  only  performed  for  the  primary  variable  (PFS)  and  selected  key  secondary 
variables (i.e. ORR and OS). 
All inferential statistics were interpreted at the 5% 2-sided level, with the exception of OS where the 
significance level was set to 0.0085% at the interim analysis of survival done at the time of the final 
PFS analysis. A method to control the family-wise type I error rate for the ORR and OS end-points was 
used:  The  hypotheses  for  ORR  and  OS  were  tested  using  a  fixed  sequence  procedure  approach  to 
control for the family-wise  error. ORR was tested  first at the 5% significance  level at the time of the 
final  PFS  analysis.  If  the  ORR  null  hypothesis  was  rejected,  then  the  OS  hypothesis  was  tested.  OS 
analyses were adjusted using O’Brien-Fleming spending function strategy with a 0.0085% significance 
level  at  the  interim  analysis  (PFS  final  analysis).  Final  OS  analysis  is  planned  after  158  deaths  have 
occurred, or 5 years from the date of randomisation of the last randomized patient,  whichever occurs 
first. 
All other efficacy variables were evaluated with an exploratory intent only. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted, including (but not limited to): 
- Impact of subsequent antitumor treatments after progression, 
- Impact of the presence and number of distant metastases, 
- Impact of the extent of tumour burden / tumour mass (centrally assessed), 
- Impact of treatment compliance. 
Duration of Response (DoR) and Time to Second Progression (PFS2) were analysed descriptively. Both 
local and central assessment were considered in exploratory analyses.

At the cut-off date for the primary end-point analysis (July 24, 2015), 341 patients were screened in 
41  centres  in  the  EU  and  the  USA.  87  patients  failed  screening  and  were  not  randomised;  these 
patients were excluded from the FAS.  
All  patients  who  consented  to  Amendment  4.1,  i.e.  to  participate  in  the  non-randomised  sub-study 
cohort (n=25), were also excluded from the FAS since by definition they were not randomised.  
Eight of the randomised patients (5 patients of the Lutathera group; 3 patients of the Octreotide LAR 
group) did not receive or take any trial medication. For 39 patients, protocol violations were detected 
and considered to be major, leading to the  exclusion of these patients. Therefore, the PPS comprised 
182 patients in total.  
Updated analyses for PFS and OS:  30 June 2016 
At the cut-off date for database lock ((30 June 2016), 360 patients had been screened in the 41 active 
centres in the EU and the USA. As 106 patients failed screening and were not randomized, these 
patients were excluded from the FAS.  
Conduct of the study 
The first patient was randomised in September 2012.  
The cut-off date for the primary end-point analysis was 24 July 2015 and the final amendment was on 
05th June 2014 (protocol version 4.1). Overall, 139 patients (60.7%) of the FAS stopped the treatment 
phase due to disease progression or other reasons (52 patients [44.8%] of the Lutathera group and 87 
patients  [77.0%]  of  the  Octreotide  LAR  group).  The  most  frequent  primary  reason  for  stopping  the 
treatment  phase  was  ‘disease  progression  centrally  confirmed  (16.4%  of  patients  of  the  Lutathera 
group and 51.3% of patients of the Octreotide LAR group).  
At the cut-off date of the 30 June 2016, 225 patients (97.4%) of the SAF stopped the treatment phase 
due  to  disease  progression  or  other  reasons  (113  patients  [96.6%]  of  the  Lutathera  group  and  112 
patients  [98.2%]  of  the  Octreotide  LAR  group).  The  most  frequent  primary  reason  for  stopping  the 
treatment  phase  was  ‘disease  progression  centrally  confirmed’  (16.2%  of  patients  of  the  Lutathera 
group and 56.1% of patients of the Octreotide LAR group).

period and end of long-term follow-up (randomised, N=231) 
After  randomisation,  8 patients  did  not  take  any  study  medication  and  were  therefore  excluded  from 
the  safety  set  (SAF).  From  the  SAF  population,  there  were  39  patients  (17.6%)  with  major  protocol 
deviations identified that led to exclusion from the per-protocol set (PPS) (17 in Lutathera arm, 22 in 
Octreotide LAR arm). These were confirmed at a blind data review meeting prior to data analysis.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint: PFS 
The median PFS was not reached for Lutathera and  was 8.5 months for 60 mg Octreotide LAR [95% 
CI:  5.8-9.1  months];  differences  in  PFS  between  treatment  groups  was  statistically  significant 
p<0.0001, with a hazard ratio of 0.18 [95%  CI: 0.11-0.29], indicating  a significantly  lower risk for a 
PFS event with Lutathera treatment compared to Octreotide LAR.  
In  the  Lutathera  arm  82%  of  the  observations  were  censored  (2.6%  because  of  start  of  new  anti-
cancer  therapy,  2.6%  due  to death  or  progression  after  two or  more  missed  visits,  5.2%  because  of 
treatment  discontinuations  for  toxicity  or  other  reason  with  no  additional  scans,  7.8%  because  of  no 
post-baseline tumour assessments and 63.8% due to no documented progression); versus, 38.1% in 
the  Octreotide  LAR  arm  (1.8%  due  to  death  or  progression  after  two  or  more  missed  visits,  2.7% 
because  of  treatment  discontinuations  for  toxicity  or  other  reason  with  no  additional  scans,  5.3% 
because  of  start  of  new  anti-cancer  therapy,  6.2%  because  of  no  post-baseline  tumour  assessments 
and 22.1% due to no documented progression).

Figure 18: Progression Free Survival (PFS) - Kaplan-Meier graph (FAS) 
At the cut-off date for post-hoc statistical analysis (30 June 2016), the number of centrally confirmed 
disease progressions or deaths was 30 events in the Lutathera arm and 78 events in the octreotide 
LAR arm (Table 26). PFS differed significantly (p<0.0001) between the treatment groups. The median 
PFS for Lutathera was 28.4 months whereas the one of octreotide LAR was 8.5 months. The hazard 
ratio for Lutathera was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.14 - 0.33), indicating 79% reduction in the risk for a patient 
to progress or die under Lutathera compared to octreotide LAR.

An  additional  analysis  was  provided  for  ORR based  on  the  results of  local  tumour  responses.  As  with 
the PFS results the results with the local assessment were more conservative than the results based on 
central assessment, but still showing a statistically significant difference favouring the Lutathera arm. 
Analyses based on local assessment are supportive.

For the interim analysis of OS at the cut-off date (24 July 2015), the number of deaths was 17 in the 
Lutathera  arm  and  31  in  the  Octreotide  LAR  arm  and  the  hazard  ratio  was  0.459  in  favour  of 
Lutathera,  but  did  not  reach  the  level  of  significance  for  interim  analysis  (HR  99.9915%  CI:  0.140, 
1.506).  The  median  OS  for  the  Lutathera  group  was  not  reached  at  the  time  of  analysis  in  the  FAS 
population, but was 27.4 months in the Octreotide LAR group.  
For the analysis of OS at the cut-off date 30 June 2016, the number of deaths was 28 in the Lutathera 
arm and 43 in the Octreotide LAR arm  with a HR of 0.536, and a median OS of 27.4 months in 
octreotide LAR arm and still not reached in Lutathera arm. The final OS analysis is foreseen after 158 
cumulative deaths.

Supportive study 
Phase I/II Study: Erasmus MC Clinical Study 
This  was  an  investigator  sponsored  phase  I/II  single  arm  clinical  study  which  was  conducted  at  the 
Erasmus Medical Center (Erasmus MC), Rotterdam, The Netherlands, to evaluate the efficacy of  177Lu-
Oxodotreotide administered intravenously to patients with somatostatin receptor positive tumours (the 
majority  GEP-NETs)  as  determined  by  OctreoScan®  scintigraphy.  Erasmus  phase  I/II  study  was  a 
monocentric single arm open label study to evaluate the efficacy of Lutathera (7,400 MBq administered 
for  4  times  every  8  weeks)  co  administered  with  amino  acid  solution  in  patients  with  somatostatin 
receptor  positive  tumours.  The  mean  age  of  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  was  58.4  years.  Most 
patients were Dutch (811) with the remaining (403) residents of various European and non European 
countries. 
The study was initiated in January 2000 and completed in December 2012. 
Methods  
Study Participants  
The main inclusion criteria were: 


 
Presence of somatostatin receptors on the known lesions demonstrated by OctreoScan® within 
6 months of the first dose of radiolabelled 177Lu-Oxodotreotide. The uptake on the 
OctreoScan® should be at least as high as normal liver uptake on planar imaging. 
 
Life expectancy >12 weeks. 
  Serum creatinine <150 μmol/L and a calculated (Cockroft’s formula), or preferably a measured 
creatinine clearance, based on two 24-hour urine collections, of >40 ml/min.

stabilized for at least six months prior to study start. Patients with a history of brain 
metastases must have a head CT scan with contrast to document stable disease prior to study 
start;  
  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure;  
  Any patient receiving therapy with short-acting somatostatin analogues in whom these 
analogues cannot be interrupted for 12 hours before and 12 hours  
 
after the administration of the radiolabelled somatostatin analogues, or any subject receiving 
therapy with long-acting somatostatin analogues in whom these analogues cannot be 
interrupted for at least 6 weeks before the administration of the radiolabelled somatostatin 
analogues, unless the uptake on the OctreoScan® during continued somatostatin analogue 
medication is at least as high as normal liver uptake on planar imaging;  
  Subjects with another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition, currently 
uncontrolled by treatment, which may interfere with completion of the study;  
 
Pregnancy.  
Objectives: 
Primary study objectives were to: 
  Determine  the  efficacy  of  treatment  with  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  in  patients  with  somatostatin 
receptor positive tumours based on tumour response rate according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
 
Evaluate  the  safety  of  treatment  with  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  in  patients  with  somatostatin 
receptor  positive  tumours  as  measured  by  the  rate  of  serious  adverse  events  and  the 
monitoring of selected laboratory evaluations. 
Secondary study objectives were to:

 
 
Evaluate  the  effect  of  the  treatment  with  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  in  patients  with  somatostatin 
receptor  positive  tumours  on  Quality  of  Life  (QoL)  as  measured  by  the  EORTC  QLQC30* 
questionnaire. 
Evaluate  Progression  Free  Survival,  Time  To  Progression  and  Overall  Survival  (PFS,  TTP  and 
OS)  after  treatment  with  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  in  patients  with  somatostatin  receptor  positive 
tumours. 
* In 2012 the EORTC-QLQ-GI.NET21 questionnaire was also added to the QoL evaluation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The ORR (including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to RECIST criteria) 
and duration of response (DoR) for the FAS Dutch population with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) and 
bronchial NETs (360 patients). 
The primary variable was tumor response rate (sum of complete response and partial response 
according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria).  
Changes from baseline were assessed 6 weeks and 3-4, 6-8, 9-12, and 12-16 months after the last 
treatment and every 6 months thereafter or until disease progression occurred.  
As part of this analysis duration of response was also assessed. This was defined as the time from 
initially meeting the criteria for response until the first documented tumor progression (per RECIST 
1.1) or until the date of last valid tumor assessment (if no progression observed). 
The secondary efficacy parameters of the study included:  
  Quality of life  
 
 
Progression free survival, time to progression and overall survival  
Examination of subgroups  
Treatments 
The patients recruited were administered 177Lu-Oxodotreotide infusion solution. The standard 
treatment regimen consists of 4 intravenous (i.v.) administrations of 200 mCi (7.4 GBq) at 6-13 week 
intervals; maximum cumulative administered radioactivity 800 mCi (29.6 GBq). 
The regimen was based on estimates for restricting the maximum bone marrow radiation dose to 2 Gy 
and kidney radiation dose to 23 Gy. Individual kidney doses were calculated based on post-3rd 
treatment scans. If the kidney dose was predicted to exceed the 23 Gy limit by a subsequent 
treatment, then the 4th treatment was withheld. If no kidney absorbed dose could be calculated, the 
administered cumulative dose was 800 mCi.  
In the standard treatment regimen, 177Lu-Oxodotreotide was administered at a rate of 200 mCi per 30 
min, with amino acid co-infusion (lysine 2.5%, and arginine 2.5% in 1 L 0.9% NaCl). Amino acids were 
administered via a separate delivery system over a 4-hour period. Thirty minutes before the 
administration of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide, 8 mg Ondansetron® was administered i.v. as a prophylaxis 
against nausea. The patients were hospitalized for 24 hours during which time adverse events were 
monitored. Safety monitoring was performed at baseline and 4 weeks after the first treatment and 2 
weeks before and 4 weeks after each subsequent treatment. Follow-up occurred at 6 weeks, and 3-4, 
6-8, 9-12, and 12-16 months after the last treatment and thereafter every 6 months, up to the 
moment of tumour progression or death or lost to follow-up.

In total 1,214 patients were enrolled in the study between January 2000 and December 2012. Out of 
those, 615 patients were enrolled in the time period January 2000 to March 2007 and additional 599 
patients were enrolled subsequently between March 2007 and December 2012. The latter cohort 
included 53 patients that were enrolled in the control arm of the 177Lu-Oxodotreotide + Xeloda study 
protocol i.e., received 177Lu-Oxodotreotide alone.

Following  the  discussions  with  the  FDA  at  the  pre-NDA  meeting,  considering  the  targeted  indication 
(GEP-NETs), and since data of the national (Dutch) population were the most accurate mainly due to a 
high  rate  of  lost to  follow-up  and  incomplete  data  in  the  non-national  (non-Dutch)  population  [mean 
follow up of 13.5 months (SD: 19.1) for the non-Dutch population and 41.1 months (SD: 36.9) for the 
Dutch population], the efficacy analyses focussed on the Dutch GEP-NET population (N: 558) only.

Progression-free Survival by tumour type  
The median PFS as assessed by the Investigator for the GEP-NET Dutch FAS population (N: 360) 
according to RECIST criteria was 29.8 months with a 95% CI of 25.4-33.0 months. The median PFS for 
Dutch pancreatic NET was 30.5 months, Dutch hindgut NET 29.3 months, Dutch midgut NET 29.6 
months, Dutch bronchial NET 18.3 months, and Dutch foregut NET not reached.  
The median PFS in patients progressive at baseline (progression radiologically or clinically assessed 
within 12 months) was 29.8 months for the FAS Dutch GEP-NET (N: 184), 28.4 months for the Dutch 
midgut NET (N: 98) and 35.6 months Dutch pancreatic NET (N: 62).  
The results are summarised in the Table 48 below.

In the Erasmus phase I/II study 188 patients (52%) received and 172 (48%) did not receive 
concomitant octreotide LAR during Lutathera treatment. No statistically significant difference in PFS 
was observed between the subgroup of patients who did not receive octreotide LAR (25.4 months 
[95% CI 22.8-30.6]) versus the subgroup who did receive concomitant treatment with octreotide LAR 
(30.9 months [95% CI 25.6-34.8]) (p= 0.747). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of Lutathera in the proposed indication is based on the results of the single arm ERASMUS 
study and the open labelled randomised NETTER-1 study. Randomised data from the NETTER-1 study 
is available only for midgut subset of neuroendocrine tumours. Data for the other subsets of the 
proposed indication, i.e., foregut and hindgut, as well as the pancreatic sub-group of patients have to 
derived and interpreted from the results of the single arm ERASMUS study. 
The ERASMUS study was a compassionate use programme at the Erasmus Medical Centre that 
subsequently enrolled 1214 patients. The efficacy data from the ERASMUS study was derived from the 
sub-group of Dutch patients since they had the most complete and accurate data in comparison to 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017  
Page 91/132 
 
 
 
 
  
 
non-Dutch patients. The patient population which is relevant to the indication included patients with 
GEP-NETs of foregut, pancreatic and hindgut origin. These patients were included in the ERASMUS 
study. The pancreatic sub-group of patients constituted the second largest group (n=133) in the Full 
Analysis set (n=360) of the Dutch GEP-NET patients, after the mid-gut sub-group (n=183). The 
numbers of other foregut and hindgut GEP-NETs were smaller, 12 and 13, respectively.  
In 2011, the applicant conducted a source data verification, including data integrity for efficacy, of the 
Phase I-II trial at the EMC in a subgroup of patients with midgut carcinoid tumours that were 
progressive within 12 months of the study entry. The first independent assessment was conducted in 
2012, the results from the EMC study led to the development of the Phase III study (NETTER-1). 
Enrolment in the Phase III study started in July 2012 for patients with neuroendocrine tumours of mid-
gut origin. The first patient was randomised in September 2012. The NETTER-1 study is still ongoing 
and will be ended as per protocol when 158 deaths will be recorded or when 5 years from the date of 
randomisation of the last randomised patient have elapsed, whichever occurs first.  The enrolment was 
completed on 14 January 2016. Expected last patient last visit (treatment phase) is Q3 2017. The 
design of the study is considered appropriate and has been discussed in the CHMP scientific advice. 
The use of Sandostatin LAR 60 mg in patients as a comparator was agreed. Though not an approved 
dose for Sandostatin LAR, it was agreed that this was an accepted clinical practice in patients who had 
progressed on the standard Sandostatin LAR dose of up to 30 mg in GEP-NETs. The endpoints for the 
study included PFS, OS and ORR which are acceptable endpoints. The CHMP triggered a routine GCP 
inspection of the 2 study sites. Some critical issues were identified that could have had a potential 
impact on the data. The applicant performed corrective actions during the procedure and submitted 
updated endpoint analyses, including all data through the 24 July 2015 clinical cutoff date for final PFS 
analysis and an interim OS analysis and safety information will be submitted through 30 June 2016. 
The submission of the updated PFS analyses provided further robustness to the effect on PFS observed 
in the primary analysis and reassured the CHMP on the validity of the data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The NETTER-1 study met its primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant 
improvement in progression free survival. However, the median PFS has not been reached for the 
Lutathera arm of the study, with a 53.4% of patients in this arm counted as missing data due to the 
fact that treatment is ongoing in these patients. The primary efficacy endpoint results, even though 
immature, favoured the Lutathera arm. The initial PFS analysis, was based on a cut-off date of 24th 
July 2015, when 94.6% of the intended subjects had completed their Lutathera treatments. The 
applicant provided updated efficacy analyses for PFS and OS based on data cut-offs of 30 June 2016. 
In the updated analysis, the median PFS in the Lutathera arm is 28.4 months (19.4; NE) and 8.5 
months (5.8; 11.0) in the Octreotide LAR arm. The updated un-stratified was HR = 0.185, 95%CI 
0.113, 0.303, p-value <0.0001 and the stratified was  HR = 0.184, 95%CI 0.112, 0.302, p-value 
<0.0001. An updated PFS and OS analysis from the 30th June 2016 datacut off was submitted and the 
un-stratified was: HR = 0.177, 95%CI 0.108, 0.289, p-value <0.0001  while the stratified HR = 0.177, 
95%CI 0.107, 0.294, p-value <0.0001. The updated data is in line with the original analysis with a 
clinically and statistically significant benefit favouring Lutathera over Octreotide LAR monotherapy. 
In the original analysis, the median OS ranged from 40.5 to 65.8. The highest median OS was in the 
pancreatic group (70.8 months), followed by the mid-gut group (55.4 months) and the median OS was 
not reached for the foregut and hindgut groups. Following the cut-off date of the 30th of June 2016, 
the median overall survival was 27.4 months (23.1, NE) for the control arm; and the median survival 
was not reached for the Lutathera arm. Only 6 randomised patients (4 randomised to the Lutathera 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017  
Page 92/132 
 
 
 
 
arm and 2 the comparator arm) finished the study treatment with Octreotide LAR monotherapy and, 
30 patients randomised to the control group received Lutathera under different program. The 
implications of these on the assessment of OS have been acknowledged. After the LPLT visit, patients 
will continue to be monitored for safety and OS and it is recommended that this follow up data should 
be provided at the end of the study.  
The ORR was also higher in the Lutathera arm compared to the Sandostatin LAR arm (17.8% vs. 3%, 
respectively). Similar to the PFS results, the median time to tumour progression has not been reached 
for the Lutathera arm, but shows statistically significant difference to the comparator arm, favouring 
the Lutathera arm.  
ORR, in the FAS Dutch GEP-NET population of the ERASMUS study, ranged from 33.3% to 60.9% with 
pancreatic and foregut endocrine tumours showing the largest effects (60.9% and 58.3% 
respectively). Sensitivity analyses including patients without baseline tumour assessment as non-
responders showed that the estimated ORR were lower (range: 21.9% to 40.9% for GEP-NETs) but 
still showing a larger effect in patients with pancreatic and foregut tumours. The lowest ORR is seen in 
the mid-gut NET sub-group, but this is also considered clinically significant at 33.3% in the FAS 
results. DoR ranged from 15.3 to 22.3  months for GEP-NETs. 
The median PFS ranged from 28.5 to 43.9 months. The highest median PFS was in the foregut group 
(43.9 months), followed by the pancreatic group (30.3 months) and hindgut group (29.4 months). 
For the sensitivity analysis, the applicant discusses that the average possible overestimation of OS and 
PFS in the Dutch population was 18% for PFS and 15% for OS. However, the benefits observed in the 
worst case scenario are still highly clinically relevant compared to the benefit described in the same 
pathology for other drugs (e.g. sunitinib median PFS in progressive pNETs 10.2 months [95% CI: 7.4 - 
16.9], PIL 5/2011, OS median not reported; everolimus median PFS in progressive pNETs 13.7 months 
[95% CI: 11.2 – 18.8], PIL 07/2012, OS not reported; lanreotide in non-functioning GEP-NETs median 
PFS not reached, PIL 12/2014). This discussion of comparative efficacy is considered relevant and 
highlights a possible durable response and survival with Lutathera. 
There is no relevant use of Lutathera in the paediatric population in the indication of treatment of 
GEP-NETs (excluding neuroblastoma, neuroganglioblastoma, phaeochromocytoma). The European 
Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Lutathera in all 
subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of GEP-NETs (excluding neuroblastoma, 
neuroganglioblastoma, phaeochromocytoma). See section 4.2. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
On the basis of the results of the NETTER-1 study along with the results seen for the mid-gut subgroup 
of  patients  in  the  ERASMUS  study  there  is  evidence  of  efficacy  for  Lutathera  in  this  sub-group  of 
patients with mid-gut GEP-NETs.  
The  results  seen  for  the  pancreatic  GEP-NET  in  the  FAS  Dutch  GEP-NET  population  of  the  ERASMUS 
study  shows  evidence  of  efficacy  for  Lutathera  in  this  sub-group,  possibly  even  greater  than  the 
efficacy seen in the mid-gut GEP-NETs. 
The numbers of patients with foregut and hindgut GEP-NETs studied were small. However, the efficacy 
endpoints’  results  appear  to  be  in  line  with  that  seen  for  the  more  common  pancreatic  and  hindgut 
GEP-NETs.  Given  the  rare  nature  of  GEP-NETS,  the  limited  evidence  is  considered  supportive  of  the 
efficacy in these sub-populations as well. 
The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

2.6.  Clinical safety 
An integrated safety database was constructed from the individual study databases for the pooled 
safety analysis. All safety analyses were completed using the pooled safety analysis set (SAF). The 
pooled safety analysis set consisted of all the Dutch patients (all tumour types) in the Erasmus MC 
study who received at least 1 dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Try3-Octreotate at the dose and schedule 
employed in the NETTER-1 study and all patients randomized in the NETTER-1 study who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug. All the safety analyses have been conducted using the more recent 30 June 
2016 cut-off date.

The 111 patients from NETTER-1 control arm were also included in the integrated summary of safety 
(ISS) database; their results are also displayed in parallel of the ISS Lutathera group for helping in the

Patient exposure 
NETTER-1 study 
In  the  NETTER-1  study  26.1%  of  the  SAF  population  received  a  total  cumulative  dose  of  177Lu-
Oxodotreotide  of  >  800mCi  and  79.3%  received  over  600  mCi  (see  table  1).  In  the  control  arm 
(Octreotide  LAR  60mg)  patients  received  a  weekly  mean  dose  of  14.8  mg  and  a  median  of  8 
administrations.

In  the  Erasmus  MC  study  65.1%  of  the  SAF  Dutch  population  received  a  total  cumulative  dose  of 
177Lu-Oxodotreotide of > 800mCi and 81.4% received over 600 mCi. 
Table 52: Cumulative dose in the Erasmus MC – SAF Dutch (N: 811) 
ISS Population 
In the pooled ISS population (NETTER-1 + Erasmus MC studies, N: 945), most of the patients received 
a cumulative dose  of ≥ 800 mCi of the drug (59.5%  of patients), and 80.7% received over 600 mCi 
(see  Table  4).  Less  than  10%  of  patients  received  a  cumulative  dose  between  400  and  600  mCi  or 
<400  mCi.  Overall,  the  mean  cumulative  dose  was  754.1  ±  283.06  mCi  and  the  median  cumulative 
dose was 800 mCi.

For NETTER-1, the safety population comprised of patients with mid-gut GEP-NETs who had received at 
least  one  dose  of  Lutathera.  For  the  Erasmus  MC  study,  the  safety  analysis  was  not  limited  to  GEP-
NETs  and  includes  all  tumour  types  enrolled  in  the  Erasmus  MC  study.  The  disposition  of  the  entire 
study population is presented in the figure below.

Adverse events 
Adverse  events  were  not  collected  in  the  case  report  form  (CRF)  of  the  Erasmus  MC  study,  with  the 
exception  of  the  pre-coded  symptoms  “nausea”,  “vomiting”,  “pain”  and  “hair  loss”.  After  July  2010, 
this  list  also  included  “diarrhoea”,  “flushes”,  “stomatitis”,  “hand  and  foot  syndrome”  and  “malaise”. 
These symptoms were only scored as yes/no. These data were not MedDRA coded and are listed in the 
Erasmus MC clinical study report (CSR). Since in the Erasmus MC study, only SAE summary data are 
available,  only  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  event  (TESAE)  information  are  summarized  and 
presented for patients in the pooled safety analysis set. 
Common Adverse Events in the NETTER-1 study 
In the pivotal NETTER-1 study all adverse events (AEs), whether or not spontaneously reported by the 
patient, were recorded starting from the signing of the ICF until the last study-related visit. 
AEs  were  coded  by  primary  system  organ  class  (SOC)  and  preferred  term  according  to  the  Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA v18). 
A  complete  summary  of  all  adverse  events  as  reported  from  the  SAF  is  displayed  by  category  in  the 
table below.

Table 54: Summary of adverse events in NETTER-1 study – SAF (N: 223) 
99% of the patients in the Lutathera arm and 95% in the Octreotide LAR arm experienced at least one 
AE  during  the  study.  98%  of  the  patients  in  the  Lutathera  arm  and  93%  in  the  Octreotide  LAR  arm 
experienced at least one treatment emergent AE (TEAE). 
TEAEs leading to premature withdrawal occurred  in  14 patients (12.5%) in the Lutathera arm and in 
12  patients  (10.8%)  in  the  Octreotide  LAR  arm;  the  difference  observed  in  the  two  arms  was  not 
statistically  significant.  Eight  patients  (7.1%)  in  the  Lutathera  arm  and  one  patient  (0.9%)  in  the 
Octreotide  LAR  arm  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  premature  withdrawal  which  were  considered  by  the 
investigator to be related to study treatment. 
In the Lutathera arm, the most frequent possible cause of treatment emergent adverse events based 
on  the  number  of  episodes  was  study  treatment  for  701  (38.3%)  AEs,  followed  by  pre-existing/ 
underlying disease for 425 (23.2%) AEs, unknown for 271 (14.8%) AEs, other causes for 144 (7.9%) 
AEs, other treatment for 44 (2.4%) AEs and protocol related procedure for 23 (1.3%) AEs.  
In  the  Octreotide  LAR  arm,  the  most  frequent  possible  cause  of  treatment  emergent  adverse  event 
based on the number of episodes was pre-existing / underlying disease for 332 (35.5%) AEs, followed 
by unknown for 231 (24.7%) AEs, other causes for 134 (14.36%) AEs, study treatment for 97 (10.7%) 
AEs, other treatment for 12 (1.3%) AEs and protocol related procedure for 5 (0.5%) AEs.

Table 56: Treatment-emergent adverse events reported in at least 10% of the patients who 
received Lutathera in NETTER-1 study by SOC and PT – SAF (N: 223) 
The numbers of patients experiencing any TEAEs (all grades) from PTs ‘nausea’, vomiting’, ‘diarrhoea’, 
‘abdominal  distension’,  ‘fatigue’,  ‘thrombocytopenia’,  ‘lymphopenia’,  ‘anaemia’,  ‘platelet  count 
decreased’, ‘lymphocyte count decreased’, ‘white blood cell count decreased’, ‘neutropenia’, ‘decreased 
appetite’,  ‘alopecia’,  ‘dizziness’,  and  ‘dysgeusia’  was  higher  under  Lutathera  treatment  compared  to 
Octreotide  LAR.  The  incidences  of  Grade  3  to  5  AEs  of  these  PTs  were  also  higher  in  Lutathera 
treatment  compared  to  Octreotide  LAR.  In  the  Lutathera  arm,  the  majority  (about  81.3%)  of  the 
“nausea”  and  “vomiting”  episodes  were  considered  related  to  the  amino  acid  co-infusion  by  the 
investigators. Also, about 13% of the ‘diarrhoea’ events, 20% of the ‘decreased appetite’ events, and 
8%  of  the  ‘fatigue’  events  that  occurred  in  the  Lutathera  arm  were  attributable  to  the  commercial 
amino  acid  co-infusion  according  to  the  investigators.  Fatigue  could  also  be  related  to  anaemia, 
nausea, vomiting and the related decreased appetite, all known transient secondary effects of PRRT14, 
18. 
Adverse drug reactions 
There were 701 ADR episodes for patients in the Lutathera arm and 97 for patients in the Octreotide 
LAR arm.  The most frequent ADRsin the Lutathera  arm were “nausea” and  “vomiting” (136 “nausea” 
events  in  the  Lutathera  arm  vs  5  in  the  Octreotide  LAR  arm  and  110  “vomiting”  episodes  in  the 
Lutathera arm vs 0 in the Octreotide LAR arm). 
Among  the  TEAE,  91.1%  of  patients  in  the  Lutathera  arm  and  40.5%  in  the  Octreotide  LAR  arm 
experienced TEAEs related to study medication (ADRs). 
The severity of TEAEs related to treatment based on the number of patients was mild (grade 1) for 24 
(21.4%)  patients,  moderate  (grade  2)  for  44  (39.3%)  patients,  severe  (grade  3)  for  30  (26.8%) 
patients, threatening/disabling (grade 4) for 4 (3.6%) AEs. The incidences of Grade 2 to Grade 4 ADRs 
in Lutathera arm were higher compared to that in Octreotide LAR arm.

in NETTER-1 study by SOC and PT – SAF (N: 223) 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs and TESAEs in the NETTER-1 Study 
Sixty-seven patients (30.0%) from both arms experienced at least one SAE, 37 (33.0%) patients in 
the Lutathera arm, 30 (27.0%) patients in the Octreotide LAR arm. 
The  number  of  patients  with  at  least  one  TESAE  was  35  (31.3%)  patients  in  the  Lutathera  arm,  27 
(24.3%) patients in the Octreotide LAR arm, differences between the treatment arms in the occurrence 
of TESAEs were not statistically significant (p>0.05).

The number of patients who experienced TESAEs considered by the Investigator to be related to study 
treatment was 13 (11.6%) patients in the Lutathera arm and 3 (2.7%) patient in the Octreotide LAR 
arm.  
Table 62: Treatment emergent serious adverse events related to study medication in

The treatment emergent SAEs considered by the investigator to be related to Lutathera were 
lymphopenia Grade 3, neutropenia Grade 4, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia Grade 4, 
ascites Grade 3, intestinal obstruction Grade 3, vomiting Grade 1, injection site hypersensitivity Grade 
2, hepatic encephalopathy Grade 3, respiratory tract infection Grade 3, dehydration Grade 3, acute 
kidney injury Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia Grade 3, 
syncope Grade 3. 
The treatment emergent SAEs in the Lutathera group related to amino acid treatment were hepatic 
encephalopathy, vomiting, dehydration (2 episodes), syncope. 
The treatment emergent SAE related to Octreotide LAR was injection site hypersensitivity Grade 2.

From non-randomized patients enrolled in the Dosimetry/PK/ECG sub-study (N=31), TESAEs were 
reported in 14 patients (i.e. 45% patients in the sub study experienced at least one TESAE). Among 
those patients, the reported outcome was fatal in 3 patients and the possible cause was pre-
existing/underlying disease. 
SAEs and TESAEs in the Erasmus MC Study 
Severe  adverse  events  were  not  typically  reported  in  the  CRF  of  the  Erasmus  MC  study  (with  the 
exception  of  a  few  pre-coded  symptoms).  A  post-hoc  review  of  the  patient’s  medical  charts  was 
conducted  to  retrospectively  collect  all  SAEs  data.  Except  for  laboratory  toxicities,  SAEs  were  not 
graded  for  their  severity.  The  principal  investigator  scored  the  causality  of  all  these  retrospectively 
collected SAEs.  
Among all enrolled Dutch patients included in  the  SAF analysis (N=811), 508 (62.8%) experienced a 
serious adverse event. Regarding specific SAEs, those with the highest frequencies were pancytopenia 
(10.5%), abdominal pain (5.8%), diarrhoea (6.4%); anaemia (5.3%), death (5.1%), pyrexia (4.3%), 
vomiting (4.1%), nausea (3.6%) and thrombocytopenia (3.3%).  
In  the  retrospective  SAEs  data  collection,  an  event  was  classified  as  pancytopenia  when  there  was  a 
simultaneous  reduction in  the  number of  red  and  white  blood  cells,  as  well  as  platelets,  according to 
the  laboratory  reports.  At  least  for  one  out  of  the  three  parameters  (haemoglobin  level,  WBC  and 
platelet counts) the CTC grade was 3-4, while for the other two parameters the CTC grade was ≥1. 
In terms of relationship to study medication, out of the 508 Dutch patients in the SAF population who 
experienced an SAE, in 163 (20.1%) patients the SAE was related to the study medication. 
There  were  14  cases  (1.7%)  of  MDS  diagnosed  2-4  years  after  the  first  treatment  with  177Lu-
Oxodotreotide and considered possibly or probably related to the treatment in the Dutch population. In 
two of these cases, the patients received two extra treatments (exceeding 29.7 GBq) and in both cases 
the MDS was considered related to the additional treatments. 
In  the  Dutch  population  the  incidence  of  serious  renal  disorders  related  to  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  was 
0.4% (3 cases) 
SAEs in the ISS population 
Since  in  the  Erasmus  MC  study,  only  SAE  summary  data  are  available,  only  serious  adverse  event 
(SAE) information was summarized and presented for patients in the pooled safety analysis set.  
Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported SAEs for both the Pooled 177Lu-DOTA0-
Try3-Octreotate  group  (21.0%  of  subjects)  and  the  Octreotide  LAR  group  (13.5%  of  subjects).  SOC 
designations with the next most frequently reported SAEs in the Pooled 177Lu-DOTA0-Try3-Octreotate 
group  were  surgical  and  medical  procedures  (19.0%  of  subjects),  blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders  (16.5%  of  subjects),  and  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (15.3%  of 
subjects). Besides Gastrointestinal disorders and neoplasms, no SOC had more than 5 subjects (4.5% 
of subjects) reporting a particular SAE in the Octreotide LAR group. The most common preferred terms 
for SAEs in the Lutathera group were pancytopenia (9.0%), followed by diarrhoea (5.7%), abdominal 
pain (5.4%), and anaemia (4.8%). The most common preferred terms for SAEs in the Octreotide LAR 
group were malignant neoplasm progression (4.5%), followed by diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, 
and small intestinal obstruction (1.8% each).

Deaths 
  Deaths in the NETTER-1 Study 
Table 63: Fatal TEAEs reported in NETTER-1 study – SAF (N: 223) 
In the NETTER-1 study, one  patient of the Lutathera arm died  due  to a non-treatment emergent AE. 
Sixteen other patients (7.2%) died due to TEAEs in the course of this study: 7 patients (6.3%) of the 
Lutathera and 9 patients (8.1%) of the Octreotide LAR arm. None of these fatal TEAEs was related to 
the study medication. 
  Deaths in the Erasmus MC Study 
In the Dutch patient population (811 patients) there were 397 deaths (49.0 %) in the 12 years follow-
up  period.  The  highest  death  rate  was  among  patients  with  other  tumour  types  and  thyroid 
carcinomas; 75.6% and 64.9% of patients, respectively. 
In the 30-day period after the last study medication was administered there were 17 deaths recorded 
in the Dutch population, all of which were judged by the PI as unrelated to study treatment.

Other significant events 
  AESI in the NETTER-1 study 
AEs, SAEs and laboratory data were analysed post-hoc to account for the toxicity categories 
hematotoxicity, secondary haematological malignancies, nephrotoxicity and cardiovascular events.

Page 109/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 66: Adverse events reported in NETTER-1 study selected post-hoc as of special 
interest 
The most frequent haematological toxicities based on laboratory CTCAE grading were Grade 2 or 
higher leukopaenia 50 patients (44.6%),thrombocytopenia 10 patients (8.9%), hematotoxicity 
multilineage 4 patients (3.6%). None of the patients experienced anaemia Grade 3-4.  
For secondary haematological malignancies, the PTs in the Lutathera arm were “diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma”, “refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia”, and “refractory cytopenia with 
unilineage dysplasia” with each PT accounting for 1 patient (0.9%).  
For nephrotoxicity, the most frequent AESIs in the Lutathera arm were “radiation-induced 
nephropathy” (38 patients [33.9%]), “renal disorder” (20 patients [17.9%]), and “acute radiation 
Assessment report

toxicity” (12 patients [10.7%]). There were three renal failure/impairment cases recognized by 
PTs/SOC, however all 3 renal failure cases were mild to moderate.  
The most frequent cardiovascular events were “hypertension” (14 patients [12.5%]), “arrhythmias” 
(13 patients [11.6%]), “hypotension” (6 patients [5.4%]), and “coronary artery disease and 
atherosclerosis” (5 patients [4.5%]).  
At the cut-off date for the primary end-point analysis, 2 MDS occurred in the Lutathera arm. An 
additional MDS case was notified after the cut-off date for the safety analyses. 
  AESI in the Erasmus MC study  
The identified treatment emergent AESIs in the Dutch population were: thrombocytopenia (129 cases, 
15.9%), leukopenia (40 cases, 4.9%), anaemia (33 cases, 4.1%), cardiac disorders (62 cases, 7.6%), 
renal and urinary disorders (49 cases, 6.0%), secondary haematological malignancies (20, 2.5%).  
All AESI belonging to the neoplasms SOC were of haematological origin. More specifically, there were 
16 Dutch patients (2.0%) who developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The other AESI with a 
frequency greater/equal to 1% were hypotension (10 patients, 1.2%), cardiac failure (12 patients, 
1.5%), myocardial infarction (9 patients 1.1%), renal failure (8 patients, 1.0%), and renal impairment 
(10 patients, 1.2%). The incidence of other blood neoplasms was, 0.1% for acute leukaemia and 0.4% 
for acute myeloid leukaemia, 0.1% for chronic myeloid leukaemia and 0.1% for chronic 
myelomonocytic leukaemia. 
Laboratory findings 
Periodic laboratory assessments were performed locally in the Erasmus MC and NETTER-1 studies. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations in the NETTER-1 study 
In the Lutathera arm, 49 patients (43.8%) had a lymphopenia (Grade 3 or 4) and 22 patients (19.7%) 
had  an  increased  GGT  (Grade  3  or  4)  diagnosed  post  randomization.  In  each  of  the  following 
categories,  between  4  and  7  patients  (3.6%  to  6.3%)  showed  post  randomization  Grade  3  or  4 
hyperglycaemia,  hyperuricemia,  hypokalaemia,  alkaline  phosphatase  increased,  ASAT  increased  and 
ALAT increased. In the comparator arm, the following toxicities were notable: lymphopenia (5 (4.5%) 
patients),  hyperuricemia  (7  (6.3%)  patients),  GGT  increased  (18  (16.2%)  patients),  and  alkaline 
phosphatase increased (10 (9%) patients). 
Regarding the Grade 3 or 4 laboratory toxicities, no relevant differences were observed between the 2 
arms,  except  for  lymphopenia,  leukopenia,  neutropenia,  and  thrombocytopenia.  A  trend  towards 
stabilisation then improvement in patients with longer follow-up is observed. 
For the lymphocyte toxicity observed following PRRT it was demonstrated that only B lymphocytes are 
affected, with no opportunistic infection being reported after PRRT. Additionally, in the NETTER-1 study 
lymphopenia in the Lutathera arm was not associated with an increased rate of infections compared to 
the control arm. The majority of thrombocytopenia in the Lutathera arm was mild to moderate. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations in the ERASMUS MC study 
The  results  of  the  association  between  the  worst  post  baseline  CTCAE  grade  3-4  laboratory  toxicities 
and administered dose (<29.6 GBq and ≥29.6 GBq) are presented below for the SAF Dutch population 
(N= 811).

Table 67: Worst post-baseline CTCAE grade laboratory toxicities according to administered 
dose (<29.6 GBq and ≥29.6 GBq) - SAF Dutch population (N=811) 
Post-baseline, results where the frequency of CTC Grade 3 and 4 was above 1% were for platelets 
(1.7%), leukopenia (2.4%), neutrophils (1.1%), anemia (1.1%) and lymphopenia (29.6%). At the last 
30-month follow-up, it was only lymphopenia where CTC Grade 3 and 4 haematology test results had a 
frequency above 1% (4.8% Grade 3).  
The haematology test results for the duration of treatment with study medication showed a trend 
towards lower values for haemoglobin, platelets, neutrophils, lymphocytes and white blood cell counts 
following each treatment. 
For serum chemistry, in general, the changes observed did not show a clear trend towards worsening 
of the laboratory parameters during the study. In the Dutch population the worst post-baseline serum 
chemistry CTCAE grade 3 and 4 with a frequency above 1% at any point during the study was 
observed for GGT (18.9%), ALAT (2.8%), and alkaline phosphatase (1.9%).

Safety in special populations 
Age 
Within the ISS population, similar fractions of patients across all age groups reported TESAEs (between 
53.7% and 62% of patients per age group). 
Among  patients  in  the  ≤  50  year  age  group,  TESAEs  were  most  frequently  reported  in  the  following 
SOCs:  surgical  and  medical  procedures  (23.5%),  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (21.2%), 
gastrointestinal disorders (18.4%), general  disorders and administration site conditions (18.4%), and 
neoplasms  benign,  malignant  and  unspecified  (10.1%).  Within  the  surgical  and  medical  procedures 
SOC, the AE preferred terms were each reported by  between 0.6% and 2.8% of patients. Within the 
blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  SOC,  the  most  frequently  reported  AE  preferred  terms  were 
pancytopenia (12.3%), anaemia (6.7%) and thrombocytopenia (2.8%). 
In  the  50  to  ≤  60  year  age  group,  TESAEs  were  most  frequently  reported  in  the  following  SOCs: 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (20.1%),  surgical  and  medical  procedures  (19%),  blood  and  lymphatic  
system  disorders  (12.6%),  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (12.6%),  and 
infections  and  infestations  (11.5%).  The  most  frequently  reported  preferred  terms  within  the  
gastrointestinal disorders SOC were diarrhoea (5.6%) and abdominal pain (4.1%). Within the surgical 
and medical procedures SOC, the AE preferred terms were each reported by between 0.4% and 2.2%

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
No adequate and well-controlled studies have been performed in pregnant or lactating women. 
Drug Interactions 
In the NETTER-1 study, concomitant medications were recorded in 223 patients (100%) of the FAS. 
The most frequent concomitant medications by ATC for patients in the FAS were “antiemetics and 
antinauseants”, followed by “analgesics”. Ondansetron was the most frequently documented 
concomitant medications substance for Lutathera group with 97 (86.6%) patients (ondansetron was 
used by 18 [16.2%] patients in Octreotide LAR group). “Paracetamol” was the most frequently 
documented concomitant medications substance for Octreotide LAR group (Octreotide LAR group: 44 
[39.6%] patients [32.8%]; Lutathera group: 46 [41.1%] patients). 
No concomitant medications were recorded in the Erasmus MC study. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The  commonest  TEAE  related  to  Lutathera  leading  to  study  drug  withdrawal  was  related  to 
haematological toxicity, followed by renal toxicity and to a lesser extent GI toxicity possibly as a result 
of  the  amino  acids  infused  with  Lutathera.  ERASMUS  study  shows  haematological  toxicity,  mainly 
thrombocytopenia;  and  renal  toxicity  to  be  the  commonest  adverse  events  leading  to  study  drug 
discontinuation and this correlates with the data from the NETTER-1 study. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety analysis consisted of all patients (all tumour types) in the Erasmus MC study who received 
at least one dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Try3-Octreotate at the dose and schedule employed in the NETTER-
1 study and all patients randomised in the NETTER-1 study who receive d at least 1 does of study 
drug. The cut-off date for the analyses was 30 June 2016. 
Though a large number of patients were recruited in the ERASMUS study, safety information was not 
routinely recorded. Safety analyses presented form this study were produced by re-evaluation of the 
patient data. The safety information from this study is therefore limited and correlation of adverse 
events including SAEs, and deaths is limited and difficult to interpret. 
More comprehensive safety information was collected in the randomised, comparative NETTER-1 study. 
Comparative safety data is available from the 2 arms of the study.  Data also was collected through 
compassionate use programs.

The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving Lutathera treatment were nausea and 
vomiting which occurred at the beginning of the infusion in 58.9% and 45.5% of patients, respectively. 
The causality of nausea / vomiting is confounded by the emetic effect of the concomitant amino acids 
infusion administered for renal protection. Due to the bone marrow toxicity of Lutathera, the most 
expected adverse reactions were related to haematological toxicity: thrombocytopenia (25%), 
lymphopenia (22.3%), anaemia (13.4%), pancytopenia (10.2%).  Other very common adverse 
reactions reported include fatigue (27.7%) and decreased appetite (13.4%). SAEs were reported in 
almost equal proportions in both arms of the study. A higher proportion of patients in the Sandostatin 
LAR arm had SAE’s attributed to underlying disease, compared to the Lutathera arm. A higher 
proportion of patients in the Lutathera arm had SAE’s considered related to the study treatment 
compared to the Sandostatin LAR arm. The incidence of non-serious adverse events has not been 
presented for the ERASMUS study. The common adverse events nausea and vomiting noted in the 
NETTER-1 studies have been attributed to the amino acid infusion. Patients presenting with certain 
clinical conditions are more prone to develop adverse reactions, a list of risk factors is included in the 
SmPC section 4.4. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor those patients more frequently during the 
treatment. In some circumstances, it might be necessary to temporarily discontinue treatment with 
Lutathera, adapt the dose after the first administration or even discontinue the treatment (see SmPC 
Table 3 - Table 5 and Figure 1).  
To avoid treatment-related nausea and vomiting, an intravenous bolus of an antiemetic medicinal 
product should be injected 30 minutes before the start of amino acid solution infusion (see section 
4.2). 
Adverse events of special interest included hematotoxicity, secondary haematological malignancies, 
nephrotoxicity and cardiovascular events. 
Bone marrow toxicity (myelo /hematotoxicity) manifested with reversible / transient reductions in 
blood counts affecting all lineages (cytopenias in all combinations, i.e., pancytopenia, bicytopenias, 
isolated monocytopenias – anaemia, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia). In spite 
of an observed significant selective B cell depletion, no increase in the rate of infectious complications 
occured after PRRT. Myelosuppression/cytopenias (immediate hematoxcicity) have been included in the 
RMP as important identified risks. Because of the potential for undesirable effects, blood counts must 
be monitored at baseline and during treatment, and until resolution of any eventual toxicity (see 
section 4.2).  
Cases of irreversible haematological pathologies, i.e., premalignant and malignant blood neoplasms 
(i.e., myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia, respectively) have been reported 
following lutetium (177Lu) PRRT. Late-onset myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukaemia 
(AL) have been observed after treatment with Lutathera (see section 4.8), occurring approximately 28 
months (9 – 41) for MDS and 55 months (32 - 125) for AL after the end of treatment. (SmPC section 
4.4 and SmPC 4.8). The median latency from exposure was 4.4 years. For comparison, 15-year 
cumulative risk of AML after chemotherapy is reported in literature as high as 10 percent, specifically 
e.g. in Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine and 
prednisone). Moreover, data in the target population suggest that the development of bone marrow 
neoplasms is most likely a consequence of previous treatments, such as chemotherapy. From the data 
available from the clinical trials and literature it is agreed that patients who have had prior treatment 
with alkylating chemotherapeutics should have a thorough risk/benefit assessment before receiving 
PRRT. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) / acute leukemia (AL) (late hematotoxicity) has been included 
in the RMP as an important identified risk. Therefore, the CHMP has imposed a PASS study to 
investigate the risk of secondary malignancies.

Lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is excreted by the kidney, mostly during the initial phase of the blood 
decay as demonstrated by the urinary recovery of about 60% of the administered dose within the first 
16/23 hours, and renal excretion within 24/48 hours of dosing accounts for about 70% of systemic 
clearance. Adequate renal function is considered essential for patients to be eligible for treatment with 
the proposed dosing regimen of Lutathera (4 treatments of 7.4 GBq each), in order to maximize 
elimination and prevent unnecessary radiation exposure to the whole body. Kidney function, as 
measured by creatinine clearance (serum creatinine must be <150 μmol/L or 1.7 mg/dL, or a 
measured creatinine clearance must be ≥50 mL/min), was one of the criteria applied in the NETTER 
Phase III study for patient recruitment and the same restriction for 177Lu-Oxodotreotide use is 
recommended in the proposed product information. The minimum threshold of measured creatinine 
clearance ≥50 mL/min was defined according to Erasmus MC Phase I/II study clinical experience and 
the ENETS guidelines for PRRT (Kwekkeboom 2009).  Somatostatin analogue peptides used in PRRT 
are known to be partially retained in the kidney and the kidney is a “critical organ” for radiotoxicity. 
The studies with Lutathera used amino acid solution co-infusion during 177Lu-Oxodotreotide treatment 
to significantly reduce (by about half) the radiation absorbed dose to the kidneys, limiting possible 
kidney toxicities. Without adequate renal function the co-infusion of amino acid solution during 177Lu-
Oxodotreotide administration could not be effective, therefore adequate renal function is considered 
essential for a patient to be treated with the proposed dosing regimen of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide (4 
treatments of 7.4 GBq each).  The long-term trend of progressive glomerular filtration function 
deterioration demonstrated in the clinical studies confirms that Lutathera-related nephropathy is a 
chronic kidney disease that develops progressively over months or years after exposure. Renal 
impairment has been included in the RMP as missing information. An individual benefit-risk assessment 
is recommended prior to treatment with Lutathera in patients with mild and moderate renal 
impairment, for additional details see SmPC section 4.2 and section 4.4 for measures to be taken for 
renal protection. The use of Lutathera is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney failure (see 
SmPC section 4.3). 
For patients with urinary incontinence, during the first 2 days following administration of this medicinal 
product, special precautions should be taken with patients with urinary incontinence to avoid spread of 
radioactive contamination. This includes the handling of any materials possibly contaminated with 
urine. 
The applicant did not submit studies on hepatic impaired patients (SmPC section 4.2). Therefore 
exposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment has been included in the RMP as missing 
information and as a warning for the need for liver monitoring in the SmPC section 4.4. 
In the NETTER-1 study, 22 patients in the Lutathera arm (19.7%) had an increased GGT (Grade 3 or 
4) diagnosed post randomization. In each of the following categories, between 4 and 7 patients (3.6% 
to  6.3%)  showed  post  randomization  Grade  3  or  4  hyperglycemia,  hyperuricemia,  hypokalemia, 
alkaline phosphatase increased, ASAT increased and ALAT increased. There is high uptake of lutathera 
in the liver (see SmPC section 11) and therefore, there is a risk for liver toxicity. Dose modification for 
liver toxicity has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC and hepatotoxicity has been included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP. 
Subtype 2 somatostatin receptors (sst2) are expressed not only in malignant cells but also in various 
non-neoplastic human tissues such as vessels, nerve plexus, pancreatic islets, prostatic stroma, 
adrenal medulla, spleen and germinal centres of the lymphoid tissues (Reubi 2001: Eur J Nucl Med, 
28:836–846). As demonstrated by the observed adverse events/adverse reactions regarding bone 
marrow depression, radiation-induced destruction of surrounding and/or distant receptor-positive 
normal tissues could occur following administration of Lutathera.

Ionizing radiations of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide may potentially have temporary toxic effects on 
female and male gonads and hypogonadism, sexual dysfunction is therefore listed as an important 
identified risk in the RMP. The SmPC includes a recommendation for genetic consultation if the patient 
wishes to have children after treatment and that cryopreservation of sperm or eggs can be discussed 
as an option to patients before the treatment. The activity administered should in every case be as low 
as reasonably achievable to obtain the required therapeutic effect. Radiotoxicity, including occupational 
exposure and inadvertent exposure, has been included in the RMP as important potential risks. 
In the NETTER-1 study, concomitant medications were recorded in 223 patients (100%) of the FAS. 
The most frequent concomitant medications by ATC for patients in the FAS were “antiemetics and 
antinauseants”, followed by “analgesics”. No concomitant medications were recorded in the Erasmus 
MC study. 
The absence of inhibition or significant induction of the human CYP450 enzymes and the absence of 
specific interaction with P-glycoprotein (efflux transporter) in preclinical studies suggest that 177Lu-
Oxodotreotide has a low probability of causing other significant drug-drug interactions. Moreover, from 
the very low mass dose (200 μg) of Lutathera resultant plasma concentrations are expected not to 
have any pharmacological effect. 
Somatostatin and its analogs competitively bind to somatostatin receptors. Therefore, this justifies 
stopping treatment with long-acting analogs of somatostatin, as far as possible, at least 4 weeks prior 
to 177Lu-Oxodotreotide administration. If necessary, patients may be treated with short-acting 
analogs of somatostatin during the 4 weeks preceding 177Lu-Oxodotreotideadministration, and until 
24 hours before the administration of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide, as done in the clinical studies. Drug 
interaction with somatostatin/ Somatostatin analogues has been included in the RMP as an important 
identified risk. 
The absence of drug interactions with respect to pharmacokinetics is acknowledged and thus, in 
general concomitant medication seemed not to be crucial, this is true particularly with antiemetics in 
order to reduce gastrointestinal adverse events like nausea and others. Furthermore, this issue is also 
adequately reflected in the product information.  
There is evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies that concomitant use of glucocorticosteroids could 
induce SSTR2 down-regulation and there was a trend towards more PFS events in patients 
concomitantly treated with glucocorticosteroids.  Therefore, as a matter of cautiousness, in line with 
the study protocol for the NETTER-1 study, glucocorticosteroids should be avoided as preventive anti-
emetic treatment because of potential receptor down-regulation (SmPC section 4.5). 
No adequate and well-controlled studies have been performed in pregnant or lactating women. 
Radionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation dose to the foetus. The 
use of 177Lu-Oxodotreotide is contraindicated during established or suspected pregnancy or when 
pregnancy has not been excluded, due to the risk associated with the ionizing radiation. It is unknown 
whether lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is excreted in breast milk. A risk to the suckling child 
associated with ionising radiation cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be avoided during 
treatment with this medicinal product. If treatment with Lutathera during breast-feeding is necessary, 
the child must be weaned. Radiation exposure during breastfeeding has been included as missing 
information in the RMP.  During treatment with Lutathera and for a minimum of the following 6 months 
after the end of the treatment, appropriate measures must be taken to avoid pregnancy; this applies 
to patients of both genders. 
It is unknown whether 177Lu-Oxodotreotide is excreted in breast milk. A risk to the suckling child 
associated with ionising radiation cannot be excluded. The medicinal product is contraindicated during 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017  
Page 119/132 
 
 
 
 
breast-feeding. If treatment with this medicinal product during breast-feeding is necessary, the child 
must be weaned (SmPC section 4.6). 
Neither overdose nor drug abuse are expected to be a concern with 177Lu-Oxodotreotide, because it is 
administered by a trained clinician with appropriate prior training and provided as a single-dose, ready-
to-use product containing a predefined amount of radioactivity. The product information nevertheless 
provides recommendations to the healthcare professional, in case of administration of a radiation 
overdose (SmPC section 4.9), to reduce the absorbed dose where possible by increasing the 
elimination of the radionuclide from the body by frequent micturition or by forced diuresis and frequent 
bladder voiding during the first 48 hours after infusion. Furthermore, hematologic and blood chemistry 
monitoring are recommended to be carried out the following 10 weeks. Lutathera belongs to a 
pharmacologic class of drugs for which withdrawal is not expected to be a concern (see radioprotection 
rules SmPC section 4.4). In addition, further precaution must be taken in case of extravasation of 
Lutathera to the surrounding tissues ( SmPC section 4.4). For each patient, the radiation exposure 
must be justifiable by the likely benefit.  
Lutathera is contraindicated  if patients have hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger 
patients. However, since increased risk of presenting haematotoxicity has been described in elderly 
patients (≥ 70 years old), a close follow up allowing for prompt dose adaptation (DMT) in this 
population is advisable.  
Hormonal crises related to bioactive substances release (probably due to lysis of the neuroendocrine 
tumour cells) have rarely been observed and resolved after appropriate medical treatment. Hormonal 
crises due to excessive release of hormones or bioactive substances may occur following treatment 
with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide, therefore observation of patients by overnight hospitalisation 
should be considered in some cases (e.g. patients with poor pharmacologic control of symptoms). In 
case of hormonal crises, recommended treatments are: intravenous high dose somatostatin analogues, 
intravenous fluids, corticosteroids, and correction of electrolyte disturbances in patients with diarrhoea 
and/or vomiting. Tumour cell lysis-related hormone release-induced crises (HRIC) has been included in 
the RMP as an identified potential risk. 
Although Lutathera is not expected to have an influence on the ability to drive and use machines, the 
general condition of the patient and the possible adverse reactions to treatment must be taken into 
account before driving or using machines. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC section 4.7. 
This medicinal product contains up to 3.5 mmol (81.1 mg) sodium per dose. This should be taken into 
consideration in patient on controlled sodium diet. 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall,  the  safety  data  provided  is  limited  owing  to  the  lack  of  routine  safety  recording  in  the 
ERASMUS  study  and  the  limited  long  term  follow-up  data  from  the  NETTER-1  study.  Therefore 
continued  monitoring  and  collection  of  safety  data  is  considered  important  to  address  the  missing 
safety concern secondary malignancy and to further characterise the important identified and potential 
risks  associated  with  the  use  of  177Lu-Oxodotreotide.  To  this  purpose,  a  post-authorisation  safety

study  is  required  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  of  Lutathera  in  routine  clinical  practice  settings,  as 
reflected in the RMP. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
  An international post-authorization safety registry to assess the long-term safety of Lutathera 
for  unresectable  or  metastatic,  somatostatin  receptor  positive  gastroenteropancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs).

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The new EURD list entry will use the EBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that the radiopharmaceutical substance ‘lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide’ has not 
been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union and the coupling mechanism 
to link the ligand (Oxodotreotide) and the radionuclide (177Lu) has not been authorised previously in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers that this radiopharmaceutical substance, which is 
complex resulting from the sequestration of radioisotope lutetium-177 (177Lu) with Oxodotreotide, is a 
new active substance as it is a not constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
The applicant requested the omission of the manufacturer’s details from the Package Leaflet due to the 
complexity of handling the numerous manufacturing sites. The manufacturer’s details will, however, be 
included in the lead container. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included 
in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will 
appear in grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017  
Page 124/132 
 
 
 
 
An English only vial label with minimum particulars, i.e. name of the medicinal product, method of 
administration, batch number, expiry date, and contents is acceptable because 1) Lutathera is 
delivered only to  healthcare professionals and not directly to the patient, 2) the minimum info on the 
immediate packaging label is considered understandable in English language and reported in national 
language on the outer packaging and 3) The 30 mL vial is enclosed in a lead shielded container that 
will constitute the outer packaging (labelled with full particulars) and will be used during transport and 
storage and the opening of the shielding to access the immediate packaging is not recommended due 
to the radioactive properties of the medicinal product. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group.  
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, LUTATHERA (lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide) 
is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lutathera is proposed to be used for the unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated 
(G1 and G2), somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-
NETs) in adults. 
Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs) constitute a heterogeneous group of 
neoplasms arising from the diffuse neuroendocrine system. Well-differentiated carcinoid tumours over-
express somatostatin subtype 2 receptors (sstr2) which is a common feature of all GEP-NETs. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Typically, the clinical management involves a multi-modal approach including surgery and other means 
of  cytoreductive  treatment  and  medical  treatment  with  chemotherapy,  interferons  and  somatostatin 
analogues. 
Only a minority of the patients with GEP-NETs  can  be cured by surgery19,  20. At the  time of GEP-NET 
diagnoses, the majority of patients have hepatic metastases21. The clinical symptoms associated with

20 Modlin IM, Moss SF, Oberg K, Padbury R, Hicks RJ, Gustafsson BI, Wright NA, Kidd M (2010). Gastrointestinal 
neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumours: current diagnosis and management. Med J Aust 193(1):46-52

metastases may differ, as these are often related to the extent of metastatic tumour-mass. NE tumour 
hepatic metastases may lead to rapid liver dysfunction but are more often associated with a long, but 
deteriorating disease course, in many cases with debilitating clinical symptoms, either due to hormonal 
overproduction or to local compression of abdominal organs.  
Without  treatment,  as  many  as  80%  of  patients  with  metastatic  disease  die  within  5  years  of 
diagnosis22. Even with currently available treatments, patients with multiple risk factors (age, number 
of  liver  metastases,  tumour  progression,  or  primary  not  removed),  have  extremely  poor  prognoses. 
For  example,  a  patient  with  metastatic  disease  with  3  of  the  noted  risk  factors  has  a  median  life 
expectancy of approximately 2 years, versus 8 years for patients with only 1 risk factor. Another study 
which examined additional risk factors, including the primary tumour site location, found that only 35% 
of patients with advanced NETs survive longer than five years23, which is only slighter better than the 
SEER statistic for stage IV prostate cancer (28%). 
The clinical management of unresectable GEP-NETs involves a multi-modal approach including surgery 
and  other  means  of  cytoreductive  treatment,  embolization,  chemo-embolization,  radiotherapy  and 
medical treatment with chemotherapy, interferons or somatostatin analogues24 .  
The therapeutic effects in metastatic disease may be limited because metastases are usually multiple, 
unresectable,  and  relatively  unresponsive  to  radiotherapy  and  chemotherapy.  Therefore  therapeutic 
options  predominantly  aim  at  palliative  care  to  improve  the  patient's  quality  of  life,  rather  than 
attempting cure25, 26.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy of Lutathera in the proposed indication is based on the results of the single arm ERASMUS 
study  and  the  open  labelled  randomised  phase  III  NETTER-1  study.  Randomised  data  from  the 
NETTER-1  study  is  available  only  for  midgut  subset  of  neuroendocrine  tumours.  Data  for  the  other 
subsets  of  the  proposed  indication,  i.e.,  foregut  and  hindgut,  as  well  as  the  pancreatic  sub-group  of 
patients have to derived and interpreted from the results of the single arm ERASMUS study. 
The ERASMUS study started enrolment as a compassionate use  study at the Erasmus Medical Centre 
but subsequently enrolled 1214 patients. Enrolment in the Phase III study started in July 2012 and the 
first patient was randomised in September 2012. The NETTER-1 study is still ongoing and will be ended 
as per protocol when 158 deaths will be recorded or when 5 years from the date of randomisation of 
the last randomised patient have elapsed, whichever occurs first.  The expected last patient last visit 
(treatment phase) is Q3 2017.  
3.2.  Favourable effects

PFS and OS analyses, the median PFS  for the control  arm was 8.5 months  while the median PFS for 
the  Lutathera  arm  was  28.4  months.  The  improvement  in  median  PFS  in  the  Lutathera  arm  was 
statistically  significant  (p<0.0001)  with  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.23  (95%  Confidence  Interval  (CI):  0.15-
0.361).  
The  PFS  data  is  supported  by  an  increased  ORR  seen  in  the  Lutathera  arm  compared  to  the 
Sandostatin LAR arm (14.7% vs. 4%, respectively). The median overall survival was not reached in the 
Lutathera arm, compared to a median overall survival of 27.4 month in the Octreotide LAR arm. 
ORR, in the FAS Dutch GEP-NET population of the ERASMUS study, ranged from 33.3% to 60.9% with 
pancreatic  and  foregut  endocrine  tumours  showing  the  largest  effects  (60.9%  and  58.3% 
respectively). DoR ranged from 15.3 to 22.3 months for GEP-NETs. 
The median PFS ranged from 28.5 to 43.9 months. The highest median PFS was in the foregut group 
(43.9 months), followed by the pancreatic group (30.3 months) and hindgut group (29.4 months). 
The median OS ranged from 54.9 to 66.4 months. The highest median OS was in the pancreatic group 
(66.4 months), followed by the mid-gut group (54.9 months) and the median OS was not reached for 
the foregut and hindgut groups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The median overall survival has not been reached for the Lutathera arm in the NETTER-1 study, but 
remains favourable in comparison to a median OS of 27.4 months in the Octreotide LAR arm. No 
detrimental effect on OS has been observed in the Lutathera arm compared to Octreotide LAR arm. 
There is no efficacy data in patients with known brain metastases therefore individual benefit-risk must 
be assessed in these patients (SmPC section 4.4). This will be monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall safety profile of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is based on pooled data from patients from 
clinical trials (NETTER-1 phase III and Erasmus phase I/II Dutch patients) and from post-marketing 
surveillance (compassionate use programs).  
Several gastrointestinal disorders have been attributable in many cases to the underlying metastatic 
neuroendocrine tumour (NET). 
The commonest adverse events, noted in the NETTER-1 study, were nausea and vomiting.  
Lutathera is extensively eliminated by the kidney, mostly during the initial phase of the blood decay as 
demonstrated  by  the  urinary  recovery  of  about  60%  of  the  administered  dose  within  the  first  16/23 
hours, and renal excretion within 24/48 hours of dosing accounts for about 70% of systemic clearance. 
Adequate  renal  function  is  considered  essential  for  patients  to  be  eligible  for  treatment  with  the 
proposed dosing regimen of Lutathera. Somatostatin analogue peptides used in PRRT are known to be 
partially  retained in  the  kidney  and  the  kidney  is  a  “critical  organ”  for  radiotoxicity.  The  studies  with 
Lutathera  used  amino  acid  solution  co-infusion  during  177Lu-Oxodotreotide  treatment  to  significantly 
reduce  (by  about  half)  the  radiation  absorbed  dose  to  the  kidneys,  limiting  possible  kidney  toxicities 
(SmPC  section  4.2).  Without  adequate  renal  function  the  co-infusion  of  amino  acid  solution  during 
177Lu-Oxodotreotide  administration  could  not  be  effective,  therefore  adequate  renal  function  is 
considered  essential  for  a  patient  to  be  treated  with  the  proposed  dosing  regimen  of  177Lu-
Oxodotreotide (4 treatments of 7.4 GBq each). Therefore, Lutathera is contraindicated in patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017  
Page 127/132 
 
 
 
 
kidney  failure  with  creatinine  clearance  <  30  mL/min.  The  common  adverse  events  of  nausea  and 
vomiting noted in the NETTER-1 studies have been attributed to the amino acid infusion. 
In addition 14 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome have been identified in the Dutch patient population 
of ERASMUS study, and in 2 Lutathera treated patients in the NETTER-1 study after the data cut-off 
point. This is of concern of the risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia, given 
the limitation of the safety analyses data provided (SmPC section 4.4). Therefore, a PASS study has 
been requested to collect post-authorisation safety data to investigate secondary malignancies.  
Due to the bone marrow toxicity of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide, the most expected adverse 
reactions were related to haematological toxicity: thrombocytopenia (25%), lymphopenia (22.3%), 
anaemia (13.4%), pancytopenia (10.2%).  
Other very common adverse reactions reported include fatigue (27.7%) and decreased appetite 
(13.4%). 
Lutathera is radiolabelled with lutetium 177, a radiopharmaceutical with a short half-life of 6.647 days 
which decays by β emission and also emits low energy γ radiation. For each patient, the radiation 
exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered should in every case be as 
low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required therapeutic effect. Exposure to ionising radiation is 
linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects. The radiation dose 
resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and mutations. In all 
cases it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation exposure are less than from the disease 
itself.  
Therefore, as with any radiopharmaceutical, there is risk for radiotoxicity, including occupational 
exposure and inadvertent exposure to patients which has been included in the RMP as an important 
potential risk and recommendations are given in the SmPC on radioprotection (SmPC section 4.4). An 
educational material for patients to address the risk(s) of radiotoxicity, including occupational exposure 
and inadvertent exposure has also been included as an additional risk minimisation measure in the 
RMP and in the Annex II. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The incidence of non-serious adverse events has not been presented for the ERASMUS study. The 
method of collection of safety data in the ERASMUS study limits the full assessment of safety from that 
study. The data provided from the results of the NETTER-1 study provides comparative safety data 
with octreotide LAR treatment. All patients in the Lutathera arm received all the intended doses of 
Lutathera, with only a few patients in both arms remaining to complete treatment with octreotide. 
Therefore, long term safety data of Lutathera is missing (RMP) and will be collected by routine 
monitoring of the safety through the pharmacovigilance plan with the follow-up data from the NETTER-
1 study where data will be collected up to 5 years from the date of randomization of the last patient.  
Long term safety will be evaluated by the collection of the toxicities suspected in relation with the 
study drug (including haematology, biochemistry, urine analyses) and monitoring of the long-term 
toxicity to critical organs suspected to be related to Lutathera (RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is a large amount of clinical experience with the use of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. 
The pivotal phase II study NETTER-1 has shown a statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit 
with improved response rates and improvements in progression free survival. The most common 
adverse reactions in patients receiving lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide were nausea and vomiting which 
occurred at the beginning of the infusion in 58.9% and 45.5% of patients, respectively. The causality 
of nausea / vomiting is confounded by the emetic effect of the concomitant amino acids infusion 
administered for renal protection. There are concerns regarding long term haematological effects 
including myelodysplastic syndrome and leukaemia, however, these risks will be addressed by a post-
authorisation safety study.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The clinical benefits demonstrated in terms of PFS and ORR are considered clinically relevant and 
outweigh the safety risks that appear manageable with the recommendations in the SmPC and the 
additional risk minimisation measures proposed. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy of Lutathera has been demonstrated in the NETTER-1 study, which recruited patients with 
inoperable, progressive, OctreoScan positive (confirmed presence of somatostatin receptors on all 
target lesions (RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1) documented by CT/MRI scans), well-differentiated 
neuroendocrine tumours of the small bowel (midgut carcinoid tumours). Therefore, the inclusion 
criteria for the study included only tumours that were considered to have a histological classification of 
G1 or G2. According to the WHO classification, G1 and G2 histological subtypes of GEP-NETs are 
classified as well-differentiated and moderately-differentiated tumours, respectively.  These tumours 
are known to express high levels of SSRs whereas G3 subtypes have lower expression of SSRs. In 
addition, literature references indicate that G3 tumours appear not to respond to peptide receptor 
radionuclide therapy (PRRT) although they may show receptor-mediated tracer uptake and the ESMO 
GEP-NET guideline algorithm states the use of PRRT in G1 and G2 tumours only. Therefore, as G3 
tumours are expected to respond poorly to somatostatin analogues, the CHMP was of the opinion that 
it was not considered appropriate to extend the indication to this patient subpopulation as the 
extrapolation would not be feasible based on the differential biological expression of somatostatin 
receptors (SSRs) as well as the poorer prognosis in patients with G3 tumours which are poorly 
differentiated tumours. However, based on the mechanism of action, the CHMP considered that there 
was no need to restrict the indication to midgut tumours as Lutathera would be expected to have 
efficacy in GEP-NET tumours irrespective of their location as long as the tumours expressed SSRs. 
Therefore, the CHMP restricted the indication to patients with well differentiated (G1 and G2), 
somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP NETs). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall the benefit risk balance of Lutathera is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of LUTATHERA is favourable in the following indication: 
Lutathera is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated 
(G1 and G2), somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP 
NETs) in adults. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Lutathera in each Member State the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The educational programme is aimed at increasing patients’ awareness on the risk of radiotoxicity by 
occupational exposure and inadvertent exposure to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and at 
providing information concerning the necessary precautions to take to limit unnecessary exposure to 
themselves and the people around them. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Lutathera is marketed, all patients/carers who 
are expected to be administered Lutathera have access to/are provided with a patient educational 
material containing: 
 
The package leaflet 
Assessment report  
EMA/506460/2017

 
Patient guide 
The patient guide shall contain the following key elements: 
o  Brief introduction to the treatment and the administration procedure 
o 
Information on the precautions the patient should take before, during and after the 
administration procedure, at the hospital and at home, to limit unnecessary exposure to 
radiations of themselves and their entourage. 
o 
Information that PPRT can cause serious side effects during or after treatment and that any 
side effect should be reported to the physician. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that ‘lutetium (177Lu) 
oxodotreotide’ is a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

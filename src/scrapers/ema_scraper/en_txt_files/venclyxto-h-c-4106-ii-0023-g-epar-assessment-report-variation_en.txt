Extension of indication to include, in combination with an anti‐CD20 antibody (obinutuzumab), treatment 
of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) for Venclyxto based on 
the results of the pivotal CLL14/BO25323 phase 3 study; consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of 
the SmPC and corresponding sections of the PL have been revised. The updated RMP version 5.1 has 
been submitted. Additionally, the SmPC section 5.3 has been updated based on the results of a 4-week 
dose ranging study, a 6-month carcinogenicity study and two embryo-foetal development (EFD) studies 
in mice. Minor editorial changes have been introduced throughout the Product Information. 
The group of variations requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

CLL remains the most prevalent chronic leukaemia in clinical practice. The treatment landscape for first-
line CLL is evolving. Deep remissions and clinically significant PFS can be achieved with 
chemo-immunotherapy combinations, such as fludarabine-based regimens, but these intensive regimens 
cannot be used for the majority of newly diagnosed patients with CLL who are older and/or have 
comorbidities. Such patients require more effective but less toxic regimens. More tolerable regimens, 
such as anti-CD20 antibodies plus chlorambucil have improved outcomes of patients with CLL and 
comorbidities compared with previous standard-of-care (chlorambucil). Chlorambucil + obinutuzumab has 
shown improved PFS and OS (Goede et al. 2014, 2018), and is now the standard of care in older patients 
with comorbidities. However, many only achieve a partial response and no MRD negativity.

The current International Working Group for CLL (iwCLL) 2018 guidelines recommend active surveillance 
until disease-related symptoms develop. The prognostic factors in CLL are largely based on recurrent 
molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities. The role of MRD negativity in achieving deeper remissions and 
longer PFS (and ultimately overall survival) is taking centre stage in clinical trials.   
Both NCCN (latest version:2020) and ESMO (2015, with an update in 2017) segregate patients with and 
without del(17p)/TP53mut and fit from unfit: 
 Figure 1 
About the product  
Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable, small molecule, B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor that 
restores programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells.  BCL-2 over expression is a major contributor 
to the pathogenesis of some types of lymphoid malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic laeukemia 
(CLL). 
The approved indications are: 
Venclyxto in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who 
have received at least one prior therapy.  
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL:  
• in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed 
a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor, or  
• in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both 
chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.  
The proposed indication is: Venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (see section 5.1). 
Venetoclax is given for a total of 12 cycles, each cycle consisting of 28 days: 6 cycles in combination with 
obinutuzumab, followed by 6 cycles of venetoclax as a single agent.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The subject of this grouped type II variation application is to extend the approved indication of venclyxto, 
in combination with the anti‐CD20 antibody obinutuzumab, as a frontline treatment of CLL.  
Further, the MAH submitted new non-clinical carcinogenicity and embryo foetal development (EFD) data. 
An overview of the new non-clinical studies is presented below.

Maternal mortality: One mouse in the 100mg/kg/day dose group was euthanised on GD10 due to adverse 
clinical signs (decreased activity, hunched posture, cold to touch and abnormal breathing sounds). This 
mouse lost 10% of body weight from GD9 to GD10. At necropsy the mouse had a perforation in the 
trachea and the applicant considered this unscheduled death to be unrelated to treatment and due to 
gavage error.  
One mouse receiving 30mg/kg/day was euthanised on GD11 due to adverse clinical signs (decreased 
activity, cold to touch, swollen forelimbs and thorax, erected fur and eye discharge). This mouse lost 19% 
of body weight from GD9 to GD11. At necropsy the mouse had a perforation in the esophagus and 
accumulation of gritty, tan material in the right axilla and the applicant considered this unscheduled death 
to be unrelated to treatment and due to gavage error.  
Maternal performance: No M27 related effects detected 
Litters: The number of late resorptions was increased in the 250mg/kg/day dose group compared to 
control (0,3 resorptions/litter vs 0,0 in controls).  This increase was considered to be unrelated to the 
treatment because the incidence was within the historical range of the testing facility.

Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data are presented in the description of the individual studies. 
Local tolerance 
No new local tolerance studies have been submitted (see discussion). 
Other toxicity studies 
The applicant has provided juvenile toxicity study for venetoclax performed in mice, however since this 
variation application only concerns only adult population, the juvenile toxicity study has not been 
assessed within this application. 
2.2.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has provided an updated ERA dated March 2019. Only the new information and its 
consequences have been considered in this assessment.    
In the Phase I assessment, the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) for PECSURFACEWATER was 
calculated with the FpenACTUAL value of 0.00048 (0.048%) as reported by Orphanet. The resulting PEC of 
0.096 μg/L exceeded the action limit of 0.01 μg/L, triggering a Phase II assessment. Persistence, 
bioaccumulation, and toxicity (PBT) were assessed in Phase II Tiers A and B.  
A Phase II Tier A base set of fate and effect studies was conducted with the exception of ready 
biodegradability (OECD 301). The PECSURFACEWATER of 0.000096 mg/L (0.096 μg/L) was used to develop the 
PEC/Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) ratios. All the Phase II Tier A PEC/PNEC ratios were < 1.

2.2.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The present procedure concerns a grouped type II variation application to extend the approved indication 
of venclyxto (venetoclax) in combination with the anti‐CD20 antibody obinutuzumab, as frontline 
treatment of CLL. Since the new proposed indication does not fall within the scope of ICH S9, the 
applicant has performed new non-clinical studies. The choice of studies were endorsed in a scientific 
advice provided in 2017 by the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/716506/2017) and include: a 6 month-
transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study, which includes dosing of venetoclax and the human metabolite 
M27; a 4-week mouse repeat-dose toxicity study with M27 and; two mouse embryo-foetal development 
(EFD) studies with M27.  All studies were performed in mice which is considered to be a relevant species.   
4-week repeat-dose toxicity study (R&D/16/0143) with M27 in mice 
The M27 human metabolite is similar to venetoclax in structure but has notably less potency (approx. 
170-fold less). M27 is observed at exposures greater than 10% of total venetoclax related exposures and 
at significantly greater levels in humans than the maximum exposure seen in animals. M27 represents up 
to around 30% of venetoclax+M27 exposure at steady state. By contrast, steady state plasma levels of 
M27 in mice and dogs were ≤ 5% of human exposure. M27 is thought to be formed via mono-oxidation of 
venetoclax on the 6-position of the cyclohexenyl moiety to give M5, followed by enzyme-mediated 
cyclization at the α-carbon of piperazine. For testing purposes, M27 (A-1621332) was synthetized.  
In a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study, mice (wild-type rasH2 mice) were dosed orally with synthesised 
M27 up to doses of 300mg/kg/day. Plasma (AUC) exposures to M27 at and above those at the venetoclax 
maximum recommended human dose (400mg/day) were achieved. 
All mice survived throughout the study and no adverse findings were reported. Similar to venetoclax, M27 
exposure resulted in haematological toxicity manifested by a decrease in lymphocyte count and 
haemoglobin. 
There were no M27-related clinical observations and no M27-related changes in clinical chemistry, organ 
weight, gross- or histopathology. 
A minimal non-dose related decrease in food intake was recorded in males but not in females. The 
decrease in food intake was coupled to a decrease in percent mean body weight gain in males at 30 and 
300mg/kg/day but not at 100mg/kg/day. However, since the differences in the absolute mean body 
weight gain can be considered small (0,35g and 0,23g vs 0,55g in controls) and there was no correlation 
with mean body weight and food consumption, the relevance of this finding is uncertain. 
A 6-month carcinogenicity study of venetoclax and M27 in transgenic mice evaluated the carcinogenicity 
of venetoclax and the major human metabolite M27 (synthesized and dosed) in orally administered Tg-
rasH2 transgenic mice. The top dose of venetoclax (400mg/kg/day) and M27 (250mg/kg/day) was the 
maximum feasible dose (based on dose volume and viscosity limitations) and resulted in an exposure 
margin to clinical AUC of around 2-fold for venetoclax and 5,8-fold for M27. Venetoclax and the M27 
major human metabolite were not carcinogenic in this study at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day of 
venetoclax and at a single dose level of 250 mg/kg/day of M27.  
As observed in previous repeat-dose studies performed in CD1 mice prior the initial MAA, non-neoplastic 
microscopical  findings related to venetoclax were seen in the lymphoid system (GALT, lymph nodes and 
thymus) and spleen in both sexes and included a generalised decrease in lymphocytes and increased 
extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen. In general, similar but lower incidence/severity of 
venetoclax-related changes in the lymphoid system and liver were present in mice given M27 at 
250mg/kg/day, consistent with the weaker pharmacologic potency of M27 as a Bcl-2 inhibitor.

The MAH’s rationale for not performing a 2-year rat study, has been accepted in the CHMP scientific 
advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/716506/2017 and the rationale is based on results obtained from a 13-week 
GLP dose-selection study in rat in which decreases in haemoglobin and RBC levels were observed. In the 
rat study there were toxic effects in female rats resulting in moribundity and early termination at high 
dose (400mg/kg/day) and adverse decreases in RBC mass at 150 mg/kg/day, corresponding to clinical 
exposure. The MTD in females was set to 8mg/kg/day. Although not as pronounced, similar effects were 
observed in male rats were a more than 10% decrease in body weight gain resulted in an MTD of 
150mg/kg/day, corresponding to an exposure margin of 0,8x to clinical exposure. These results indicate 
that even at sub-therapeutic exposure levels, female rats would not survive for 2-years and the survival 
of male rats would be uncertain and therefore omission of the 2-year rat study is acceptable. 
In conclusion, the absence of carcinogenic effects of venetoclax or M27 in the 6-month transgenic mouse 
carcinogenicity study, in combination with previously reported negative genotoxicity findings with 
venetoclax and M27 and the absence of neoplastic lesions in chronic venetoclax toxicity studies in CD1 
mice (6-months) and dogs (9-months), suggest a low carcinogenic risk to patients treated with 
venetoclax. 
In the Embryo-foetal studies study performed for the initial MAA, venetoclax was associated with post-
implantation loss and decreased foetal body weight in mice and maternal toxicity in rabbits. Only one 
species (mouse) was used to assess for M27-related maternal and embryo-foetal toxicity. The approach 
was considered acceptable in the CHMP scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/716506/2017). 
The applicant performed two new EFD studies (one DRF and one pivotal GLP study), both performed in 
CD1 mice, with the major human metabolite M27.  In the pivotal GLP study the high dose of 250 
mg/kg/day (dosed from GD6 to GD15) was the maximum feasible dose (based on dose volume and 
viscosity limitations) and resulted in an exposure margin of maternal to clinical AUC of around 8-fold and 
a mean foetal to maternal M27 concentration ratio of 0,534.  
The major human metabolite M27 was associated with post-implantation loss and resorptions at 
exposures approximately 9-times the human M27-AUC exposure at a 400 mg dose of venetoclax. In 
rabbits, venetoclax produced maternal toxicity, but no foetal toxicity at exposures of 0.1 times the human 
AUC exposure at a 400 mg dose. 
There were no mortalities at any doses tested. Compared to the concurrent controls, there were signs of 
M27-related adverse effects on embryo-foetal development, based on the increase in resorptions 
(control:0,4; 30mg:1,1; 250mg:1,5) and post-implantation losses (control:3%; 30mg:7,87%; 250mg: 
9,72%). The proposed maternal NOAEL of 250mg/kg/day is agreed. The wording the SmPC section 4.6 
where use of venetoclax is not recommended during pregnancy and breast-feeding remains unchanged. 
The applicant has provided juvenile toxicity study for venetoclax performed in mice, however since this 
variation application only concerns only adult population, the juvenile toxicity study has not been 
assessed within this application. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Due to the change in indication, the applicant has provided an updated ERA based on new Fpen value 
(0,48%) which has been taken from the Orphanet portal for rare diseases. This approach is considered 
acceptable. PEC/PNEC ratio values were all <1. In line with previous assessment of venetoclax and based 
on the updated data submitted in this application, the new indication does not lead to a significant 
increase in environmental exposure further to the use of venetoclax.

2.2.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects in support of this extension of indication are adequately studied. The new non-
clinical studies assessed in this application do not indicate an increased risk of carcinogenicity of either 
venetoclax or the M27 major human metabolite. M27 produced embryo-foetal toxicity at exposures 
approximately 8-times the human margins. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of venetoclax.  
Considering the above data, venetoclax is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has provided 
a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in 
accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The new clinical pharmacology information includes venetoclax PK, efficacy, and safety data from patients 
with 1L and R/R CLL participating in the following two clinical studies:  
• 
Pivotal Phase III Study BO25323, is an ongoing trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
venetoclax + obinutuzumab (VEN+G), Arm A compared with obinutuzumab + chlorambucil 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

(GClb), Arm B in patients with previously untreated CLL patients and coexisting medical 
conditions.  The study included:  pre- and 4 hours post-dose PK sampling for venetoclax, pre- and 
end of infusion PK sampling for obinutuzumab (approximately four PK samples per VEN+G treated 
patient) on a single visit of Day 1 in Cycle 4 from 194 patients in Arm A.  A summary of PK 
concentrations for venetoclax and obinutuzumab from the primary CSR are provided in this 
document.  A PopPK analysis of the venetoclax PK data using a Bayesian approach and the E-R 
(efficacy/safety/tolerability) analysis for patients randomized to VEN+G arm was performed.  
•  Updated data from the supportive Phase Ib Study GP28331, which is an ongoing Phase Ib, 
multicenter, open-label, dose-finding and safety study of venetoclax administered in combination 
with obinutuzumab.  A total of 82 patients were enrolled in the study, 50 R/R and 32 previously 
untreated CLL patients. This study is a dose-escalation study with venetoclax doses ranging from 
100 mg to 400mg.  The study includes venetoclax and obinutuzumab PK sampling from 81 
patients and was included in the original submission. The venetoclax PK data from this study was

Details of specific and sensitive bioanalytical assays using high performance liquid chromatography 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) developed and validated for the quantitative determination of 
venetoclax in human plasma were provided in the original application. 
During sample analysis, the assay reproducibility was demonstrated at least once per assay using an 
incurred samples reanalysis (ISR) approach.  There was no change in analytical methods for venetoclax 
assays that were provided in the original application and subsequent filings. 
Details of the specific and sensitive bioanalytical assays for the quantitation of obinutuzumab using an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform validated at PPD and a titer-based bridging ELISA 
for the quantitation of anti-obinutuzumab antibodies developed at PPD were provided to the agency 
during the registration of Gazyva®.  The method validations were conducted in compliance with internal 
standard operating procedures.  The assay reproducibility for the quantitation of obinutuzumab was 
demonstrated using an ISR approach during sample analysis.

Pharmacokinetics 
Population PK  
Methods 
The PopPK of venetoclax in R/R CLL/SLL, NHL, and healthy subjects was characterized in support of the 
filing of venetoclax used as monotherapy in patients with R/R CLL. The current PopPK analysis used the 
PopPK model structure (a two-compartment PK model with first-order absorption and elimination) from 
the initial MAA with the parameters implemented as informative Bayesian priors. This model was then fit 
to the Studies GP28331 and BO25323 PK data to yield the final PopPK model and parameters. 
Model parameters were estimated with the new data, and additional covariates (not previously evaluated) 
were tested in the model. These covariates were obinutuzumab co-administration and Binet stage.  
Bayesian prior distributions were not used for these additional covariates.  Covariate effects were added 
to the model multiplicatively and tested with alpha=0.01 significance level.  The final model was 
evaluated using diagnostic plots, visual predictive check, and normalized prediction distribution errors 
(NPDE) plots.  Correlations of apparent clearance with previously tested covariates (that were found not 
to be significant in the previous model) and the additional covariates (not previously evaluated) were 
investigated by diagnostic plots. Individual post-hoc estimated PK parameters were computed from the 
final model and used to calculate steady state exposures.  These PK parameters and exposures were 
summarized overall and stratified by study.  The non-linear mixed-effects modelling software, NONMEM 
Version 7.4.3, utilizing PRIOR subroutine and the first-order conditional estimation method with 
interaction was used for the analysis. 
Results 
Among 216 patients randomized to Arm A in study BO25323, 13 patients in the safety run-in phase from 
Study BO25323, and 82 patients enrolled in Study GP28331, a total of 274 patients (194 from Study 
BO25323 and 80 from Study GP28331) had at least one quantifiable PK sample and were included in the 
analysis.  A total of 1,563 quantifiable samples from 274 patients were used in the analysis. A total of 
2.6% of samples were below limit of quantification and were excluded from the analysis.  
The final model was structurally identical to the model of the previous analysis. The data were described 
by the two-compartment popPK model with first-order absorption and elimination.  The parameter 
estimates were very similar to the estimates of the previous analysis.

Obinutuzumab co-administration and Binet stage did not influence venetoclax apparent clearance. In 
agreement with the previous model, no relationship was observed between venetoclax apparent clearance 
and body weight, age, sex, mild and moderate hepatic and renal impairment, CrCL, AST, ALT, bilirubin, 
albumin and co-administration of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors or weak CYP3A inhibitors.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Methods 
A Bayesian PopPK approach was used to characterize the PK properties of venetoclax in Studies GP28331 
and BO25323 and to provide the individual subject exposure metrics for an assessment of the exposure-
efficacy, exposure-safety and exposure-tolerability relationships for Study BO25323 only. 
•  Analysis of Exposure-Safety and Exposure-Tolerability Relationships  
The objectives were to investigate the relationships between venetoclax exposure and  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
probability of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia;  
probability of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia;  
probability of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 infections (including opportunistic infections);  
probability of treatment-emergent serious adverse events;  
venetoclax dose intensity; 
obinutuzumab dose intensity.  
For each AE type, logistic regression models were implemented to assess correlation of the probability of 
AE occurrence with venetoclax exposure. Covariate modeling was implemented using the forward 
selection procedure with α = 0.01 significance level. The evaluated covariates were: demographics (body 
weight, sex, age, race), geographic region, and baseline disease characteristics (ECOG score, Binet stage, 
CLL risk group, presence of B-symptoms, CIRS score, and somatic mutations [17p deletion, 11q deletion, 
13q deletion, 12t trisomy, TP53 mutation, IgVH mutation]). The resulting full model was used to evaluate 
the exposure-response relationship. Significance levels of covariate effects (associated p-values) were 
also presented. As the main purpose of the analysis was to evaluate the effect of exposure, backward 
elimination from the full model was not implemented.  
Dose intensity (DI) was used to characterize treatment tolerability. Correlations of venetoclax and 
obinutuzumab DI with CmeanSS,nominal  were explored graphically and were summarized by tertials of 
CmeanSS,nominal .  
•  Analysis of Exposure-Efficacy Relationships  
The objectives were to assess the relationships between venetoclax exposure and  
• 
• 
investigator-assessed (INV) progression-free survival (PFS);  
independent review committee (IRC) -assessed PFS 
For each endpoint, graphical time-to-event analyses (KM plots) stratified by quartiles or tertials of 
CmeanSS,nominal and Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) modelling were conducted. CmeanSS,nominal  was used as a 
measure of exposure; continuous and categorical (tertials of exposure) variables were tested. Covariate 
CPH modelling was implemented using the forward selection procedure with α = 0.01 significance level 
and the same covariates as for the exposure-safety analysis. The resulting full model was used to 
evaluate the exposure response relationship. Significance levels of covariate effects (associated p-values) 
were also presented. 
•  Data 
The exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy analyses were conducted with data collected from patients of 
Study BO25323/CLL14 randomized to venetoclax + obinutuzumab arm. The data from the safety run-in 
part of the study were not used.  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

Page 27/80 
 
 
  
  
The empirical Bayes post-hoc estimates of venetoclax primary PK parameters (apparent clearance [CL/F] 
and relative bioavailability [F1]) estimated using the final population PK model and the relevant PK 
covariates for each subject, were used to estimate an individual exposure measure, the nominal 
venetoclax exposure at steady state (CmeanSS,nominal), as follows: 
CmeanSS,nominal = Dnom*F1/(CL/F)/τ,                                                       
where Dnom was the nominal target dose assigned to a patient at randomization (400 mg), and τ was 
inter-dose interval (1 day). Since the PK model predicted dependence of bioavailability on dose, the 
nominal dose (Dnom) was used to compute the relative bioavailability parameter for the exposure 
measures. Values of covariates at the time of the first obinutuzumab dose were used to compute 
apparent clearance. 
For subjects who did not have evaluable PK data and were not included in the population PK analysis, the 
primary PK parameters were imputed using the population estimates and the individual subject's 
covariate values. 
Results 
The analyses included 203 patients from venetoclax + obinutuzumab arm of the study (excluding safety 
run-in patients).  
•  Exposure-Safety Analyses 
A total of 118 (58.1%) patients had a treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia; 30 (14.8%) patients 
had treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia; 39 (19.2%) patients had treatment-emergent 
Grade ≥ 3 Infections, and 96 (47.3%) patients had treatment-emergent serious adverse events. For all 
investigated types of AE, there were no statistically significant relationships between venetoclax exposure 
and the probability of AE occurrence.  
The logistic regression analysis of exposure-safety relationships in patients from StudyBO25323 indicated 
that there was no statistically significant relationship between venetoclax exposure and the probability of 
developing TEAEs of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia, Grade ≥ 3 infections or SAEs.

concentrations (p = 0.012). Subjects with Binet Stage C (BINET =3) were estimated to have significantly 
higher probability of Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia (p < 0.001). No covariates had significant effects on the 
probability of Grade ≥3 infections at α = 0.01 level. Subjects from Central or Eastern Europe (REGION = 
4) were estimated to have a significantly lower probability of serious adverse events (p = 0.006).

Table 16. Logistic Regression Analyses for Adverse Events:  Final Models
•  Exposure-Dose Intensity Analyses 
Dose intensity was calculated as the total cumulative dose actually received divided by the cumulative 
planned dose. The planned (target) dose of venetoclax was 400 mg and the cumulative planned dose was 
calculated from the day when a patient first received the 400 mg dose of venetoclax (Cycle 2, Day 22) 
until the last actual dose of venetoclax received. The maximum total planned duration of venetoclax 
treatment after reaching target dose in this approach for calculating dose intensity was 287 days (9.6 
months). 
The median duration of exposure to venetoclax, from first venetoclax dose, was 315.0 days (10.5 
months) (range: 1-406 days [13.5 months]). After reaching the target dose, the median dose intensity 
for venetoclax was 97.5% (range: 14%-100%). 
Obinutuzumab mean dose intensities in venetoclax + obinutuzumab arm were comparable across 
venetoclax exposure tertials and were between 92.5% and 97.2% for all tertials of venetoclax exposure. 
Venetoclax mean dose intensities in venetoclax + obinutuzumab arm were comparable across venetoclax 
exposure tertials and were between 81.1% and 89.3% for all tertials of venetoclax exposure.

indicated no venetoclax exposure-PFS relationships. Risk of progression or death was lower in patients 
with t12 trisomy (p < 0.01). None of the covariates were significant at α = 0.01 level.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The bioanalysis methods for both venetoclax and obinutuzumab were not changed since their respective 
original application and were therefore not re-assessed. The same is true for the ADA method. 
QCs and calibration curves were within the acceptance criteria in the analytical runs for studies BO25323 
and GP28331, for both venetoclax and obinutuzumab. ISR was performed and passed in all studies where 
it was required. No ISR was performed in study BO25323 for venetoclax, but ISR was passed (95.1% of 
41 study samples were within ±30%) for obinutuzumab. During the analysis of study GP28331 samples, 
the sample preparation for venetoclax was changed from solid phase extraction to liquid/liquid extraction. 
This change of method was adequately validated using the ISR with 16 samples, where all met the 
acceptance criteria. 130 samples were reanalyzed for obinutuzumab and 80.8% of them passed the ISR 
acceptance criteria. ADA analysis (screening, confirmation & titration) was performed only in study 
GP28331. No ADAs were detected in the patients´ samples. No NAb analysis was performed. 
The purpose of the PopPK model was to confirm that PK of venetoclax did not change with co-
administration of obinutuzumab, and to provide the individual subject exposure metrics for an 
assessment of the exposure-efficacy, exposure-safety and exposure-tolerability relationships for Study 
BO25323. 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis was in general well performed and adequately reported. The 
methods applied were according to general standards. The goodness-of-fit plots and the dose-normalised 
visual predictive checks for the final model reveal a reasonable prediction of lower concentrations, 
however the high concentrations (8 hours post dose samples) are under-predicted. This is also visible in 
the Goodness of Fit plots.  
The diagnostic plots of the model did not indicate any model deficiencies. The model evaluation 
procedures (prediction-corrected visual predictive check [pc-VPC]) confirmed good predictive abilities of 
the model and there were no dependencies unaccounted for by the model.  
Overall, the PopPK model adequately characterized venetoclax plasma concentrations over time in 
Studies GP28331 and BO25323. The PK of venetoclax was similar when co-administered with 
obinutuzumab. The model is sufficient to use for simulations and to evaluate the E-R relationships of 
venetoclax for Study BO25323. The parameters from the updated model do not differ greatly from the 
previous estimation. 
Venetoclax is a small-molecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that binds with high affinity to Bcl-2 and with 
much lower affinity to other Bcl-2 family proteins like Bcl-XL, Bcl-w. Venetoclax can restore programmed

cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells where it has been blocked by high level expression of Bcl-2. 
Obinutuzumab is a novel, humanized, type II glycoengineered MAb directed against the CD20 antigen, 
which is found on most malignant and benign cells of B-cell origin. Obinutuzumab has the following 
characteristics:  high-affinity binding to the CD20 antigen, low complement-dependent cytotoxicity 
activity, high direct cell death induction, and high antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-
dependent cellular phagocytosis. 
The objective was to investigate exposure-safety, tolerability and efficacy relationships for venetoclax 
when co-administered with obinutuzumab. Individual subject CL/F and F1 were derived from the PopPK 
model and used to calculate CmeanSS,nominal for a 400 mg dose. Dose adjustment were not taken into 
account analysis, therefore the conclusions made are not supported. 
The logistic regression analysis of exposure-safety relationships indicated that there was no statistically 
significant relationship between venetoclax exposure and the probability of developing Grade ≥ 3 
neutropenia, Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia, Grade ≥ 3 infections or serious adverse events. The trend 
indicated that the probability is lower with increasing exposure, however, these subjects may have 
reduced their dose, thereby giving arise to this trend 
The obinutuzumab dose intensities were comparable across venetoclax exposure tertiles, with the 
medians equal to 100% for all exposure groups. Venetoclax co-administration did not impact the delivery 
of obinutuzumab. Some trends are observed for lower venetoclax dose intensities with increasing 
venetoclax exposures, however, this was not considered clinically relevant given the lack of apparent E-R 
relationships with the primary efficacy endpoints and the key AEs of interest. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PopPK model adequately characterised venetoclax plasma concentrations over time in 
Studies GP28331 and BO25323. The PK of venetoclax was similar when co-administered with 
obinutuzumab. The model is sufficient to use for simulations and to evaluate the E-R relationships of 
venetoclax for Study BO25323. 
The Applicant investigated exposure-safety, tolerability and efficacy relationships for venetoclax when co-
administered with obinutuzumab.  The clinical pharmacology aspects of the proposed indication are 
adequately studied.

The rationale for selection of the recommended dose and regimen for venetoclax in combination with 
obinutuzumab in the treatment of previously untreated CLL patients with coexisting medical conditions in 
the Pivotal StudyBO25323 was based on available information, from the Phase I dose-escalation Study 
M12-175 and is further supported by the Phase Ib dose-finding/safety Study GP28331 of venetoclax in 
combination with obinutuzumab in patients with R/R or previously untreated chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia.

The safety run-in included 13 patients (VEN+G). Once the twelfth patient had reached the end of cycle 3 
the randomized portion began. A total of 432 patients were randomized. 
The treatment duration in both groups (VEN+G vs GClb) consisted of 12 cycles lasting 28 days each. No 
crossover was allowed. Obinutuzumab was administered iv for 6 cycles starting with 100 mg on day 1 and 
900 mg on day 2 (or 1000 mg on day 1), 1000 mg on day 8 and 1000 mg on day 15 of cycle 1, and 
subsequently 1000 mg on day 1 of cycles 2 through 6. Chlorambucil was administered orally at 0.5 mg 
per kilogram of body weight on days 1 and 15 of each cycle until completion of 12 cycles. The daily oral 
venetoclax regimen was initiated on day 22 of cycle 1, starting with a 5-week dose ramp-up (1 week each 
of 20, 50, 100, and 200 mg, then 400 mg daily for 1 week), thereafter continuing at 400 mg daily until

Sample size 
The sample size for the study was determined given the requirements to perform a hypothesis test for 
clinically relevant statistical superiority in the primary endpoint of PFS. 
Estimates of the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy with regard to PFS were based on the 
following assumptions: 
• 
Log-rank test at the two-sided 0.05 level of significance 
•  Median PFS for GClb control arm (27 months) 
•  80% power to detect HR = 0.65 for the comparison of VEN + G experimental arm versus GClb, 
with median PFS for VEN + G increased to 41.5 months 
• 
Exponential distribution of PFS 
•  Annual drop-out rate of 10% 
One interim analysis for efficacy after 75% of PFS events, utilizing a stopping boundary according to the 
 family error spending function with parameter  = −9.21. 
The addition of an optional early interim analysis (performed after 85 events [50% of PFS events] as per 
Protocol amendment 7 required no adjustment to the sample size, as the impact on the statistical power 
calculation was negligible.

EMA/166265/2020 
Page 37/80 
 
 
  
  
Based on these assumptions, a total of 170 PFS events is required for the final PFS analysis of PFS.  
Randomisation 
Patients were assigned in 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms (VEN + G or GClb) through a block 
stratified randomization procedure. The randomization scheme ensured approximately equal sample sizes 
in the two treatment groups with regards the following stratification factors: 
•  Binet stage (3 levels): A, B, or C 
•  Geographic region (US/Canada/Central America; Australia/New Zealand; Western Europe; Central 
and Eastern Europe; or Latin America) 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. The IRC and the sponsor were blinded to treatment arm. 
Statistical methods 
Treatment comparisons were made using a two-sided log-rank test (at 0.05 significance level, adjusted 
for the interim analyses), stratified by Binet stage and Geographic Region. If the null hypothesis was 
rejected and the observed HR was favourable for the VEN + G experimental arm, then it was to be 
concluded that VEN + G significantly lowered the risk of PFS events more than GClb. A two-sided non-
stratified log-rank test was performed to support the primary analysis. 
Median PFS and the 95% confidence limits will be estimated using Brookmeyer Crowley method, with the 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve presented to provide a visual description. PFS rates for 1, 2, and 3 years 
after randomization with 95% CIs using Brookmeyer Crowley method will be reported. Estimates of the 
treatment effect will be expressed as HR including 95% confidence limits estimated through a Cox 
proportional-hazards analysis stratified by Binet stage and Geographic Region. 
For patients who were alive and had not had disease progression or relapse, PFS data were censored on 
the date of the last disease assessment. In the analysis of MRD negativity and response to treatment, 
patients without a sample or response assessment that could be evaluated were counted as not being 
negative for residual disease or as not having a response, respectively. 
If the study meets the primary efficacy endpoint of investigator assessed PFS, then the formal statistical 
testing procedure for the key secondary endpoints will be performed using alpha-splitting and recycling of 
alpha. To adjust for multiple testing, the pre-specified hierarchical testing of eight key secondary efficacy 
endpoints was used in the following order: 
1. Independent review committee-assessed PFS 
2. Minimal residual disease in bone marrow 3 months after treatment completion 
3. Complete response rate [investigator-assessed] 3 months after treatment completion 
4. Minimal residual disease in peripheral blood 3 months after treatment completion 
5. Minimal residual disease in complete response in bone marrow 3 months after treatment 
completion 
6. Minimal residual disease in complete response in peripheral blood 3 months after treatment 
completion 
7. Overall response rate [investigator-assessed] 3 months after treatment completion 
8. Overall survival

To check robustness of the primary analysis of PFS and underlying assumptions, the following sensitivity 
analyses for PFS (both investigator-assessed and IRC-assessed) will be performed on the ITT population: 
•  An unstratified log-rank test for the primary PFS comparison between treatment arms will be 
conducted. 
• 
• 
The impact of patients’ initiation of non-protocol specified anti-CLL therapy without meeting the 
criteria of disease progression/relapse on PFS will be assessed by censoring these patients at the 
start date of the non-protocol specified anti-CLL treatment. Stopping only one component of the 
randomized study treatment will not be considered a reason for censoring patients. 
To assess the impact of missing assessments on PFS, an analysis on PFS will be performed by 
censoring those patients who progressed, relapsed or died after missing more than one visit 
consecutively at their last adequate response assessment date before the missed visits. 
The primary and secondary analyses were based on the ITT population, defined as all randomized 
patients. Subgroup analyses of investigator-assessed PFS, IRC-assessed PFS, MRD, ORR, CR and OS were 
performed to assess internal consistency using the ITT population. The odds ratios of response and their 
95% confidence intervals, HR of time-to-event endpoints and their 95% confidence intervals (based on 
similar analyses to the primary endpoint), as well as the sample sizes were reported separately for each 
level of the following subgroups in forest plots by baseline characteristics and stratification factors (Binet 
stage and Region). 
Originally an interim analysis for efficacy were planned once a minimum of 110 PFS events have 
occurred. PFS were to be tested at the significance level determined using the gamma family error 
spending function with parameter γ=−9.21 so that the overall two-sided type I error rate will be 
maintained at the 0.05 level. In protocol amendment 7 an optional early interim analysis (at a minimum 
of 85 events) was included, if this was performed and passed, this later original interim analysis was not 
to be undertaken. 
The final analysis was designed to be conducted after 170 events have occurred. venetoclax dose, then 
the interim analysis may be conducted once a minimum of 85 PFS events have occurred.  
Also, exploratory analyses were performed, including graphical analyses, of the relationship between MRD 
(on the basis of peripheral blood results by ASO-PCR) and PFS.

The patients were elderly (median age, 72 years; range: 41 to 89; 34.7% were aged over 75 years) and 
white (89.4%). Approximately two-thirds of patients (66.9%) were male. The majority of patients were 
enrolled in Europe, 69.7%. Overall, the median time from first diagnosis of CLL to randomization was 2.5 
years (0-20.4 years). The majority of patients were Binet stage B or C (79.1%) at baseline and 
approximately half (49.8%) were experiencing B symptoms at baseline, with night sweats (43.5%) being 
the most frequent B symptom. TLS risk was categorized as low, medium or high and the risk categories 
were balanced between groups: 43 patients (20%) in the GClb arm and 48 (22.2%) in the VEN+G arm 
belonged to the high- risk category). The majority of patients (66.2%) were considered as intermediate 
risk. 
The proportion of patients with unmutated IGVH mutational status (based on central assessment) was 
57% in the GClb arm and 56% in the VEN+G arm; 10 patients in the GClb arm (4.6%) and 19 in the 
VEN+G arm (8.8%) either had missing samples or were not evaluable for IGVH mutational status. The 
TP53 mutation was carried by 13 patients (6%) in the GClb arm and 19 patients (8.8%) in the VEN+G 
arm. The mutational status was unknown for 59 patients (27.3%) in the GClb arm and 45 (20.8%) in the 
VEN+G arm. The 17p deletion was present in 14 patients (7.3%) in the GClb arm and 17 patients (8.5%) 
in the VEN+G arm. 
The median CIRS score was numerically higher in the VEN+G arm (9 vs 8 in the GClb arm), and the 
proportion of patients with CIRS score of >6 was 86.1% compared with 81.9%, respectively. The 
proportion of patients with creatinine clearance <70 mL/min was 55.4% in the GClb arm and 59.5% in 
the VEN+G arm.  
In terms of prognosis, the CLL-IPI scores were similar for the two treatment arms; 60% in the GClb arm 
and 60.4% in the VEN+G arm had a high score.  
CIRS: 177 patients (81.9%) in the GClb arm and 186 (86.1%) in the VEN+G arm had a CIRS score >6. 
Most patients in each treatment arm had comorbidities in 4-8 organ systems (179 patients [82.9%] in 
both arms). A higher percentage of patients in the VEN+G group had involvement of cardiac systems and 
hypertension, followed by respiratory organ system.  
As for concurrent diseases, vascular disorders were the most frequent type of concurrent medical 
condition: GClb 155 (71.8%) compared with 175 (81%) in the experimental arm, mainly due to 
hypertension; COPD: 11 patients (5.1%) in the GClb arm vs 18 (8.3%) in the VEN+G arm; asthma 6 
(2.8%) vs 10 (4.6%), respectively.

Sensitivity analyses for PFS 
Three sensitivity analyses of investigator-assessed PFS were conducted to test for the potential impact of 
differences in modelling or censoring approaches: 
1. A non-stratified log-rank test 
2. PFS analyses with censoring at initiation of non-protocol-specified anti-CLL therapy before meeting 
disease progression criteria to assess potential confounding of treatment effect estimates by subsequent 
therapy 
3. PFS analyses with censoring of death or disease progression after more than one missed response 
assessment at the date of last adequate response assessment

MRD 
MRD responses comprised 1) peripheral blood MRD assessment in all patients and 2) bone marrow MRD 
assessment in responders (CR+PR). ASO-PCR MRD was assessed 3 months after treatment 
completion/early termination for all patients (PB and BM) and across pre-specified time-points for PB 
(every 3 mo for 18 months from EOT and thereafter every 6 months until 5 years from last patient 
enrolled). The patients for whom no post-baseline MRD assessment was available at a specific time-point 
were considered MRD positive for that particular time-point. The status recorded for missing bone marrow 
biopsies or missing computed tomographic scans was partial response or stable disease, respectively.

Ancillary analyses 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses of investigator-assessed PFS and MRD negativity in peripheral blood 3 
months after treatment completion were performed to assess internal consistency using the ITT 
population.  
Pre-specified subgroups included: Binet stage at screening (A, B, C), Age (<75, ≥75), Gender (male, 
female), Cytogenetic factors (deletion 17p, 11q and 13q, and trisomy 12), TP53 status (deletion and/or 
mutation, none), IGVH mutational status (unmutated, mutated) 
Since the study was powered for the ITT population, all subgroup analyses were exploratory.

Results 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
All 1L patients responded to treatment; 25/32 (78.1%) achieved a CR/CRi. 
Consistent overall response rates and deep remissions were observed in all patient subgroups, 
regardless of cytogenetic factors and/or physical fitness status. Responses were similar among 
patients with del(17p)/TP53 mutation or IgVH mutational status.  
The median duration of response was not reached in 1L patients (range: 10.2-33.3 months).  At 1 
and 2 years after their first response, the percentage of patients remaining in response to treatment 
was 93.75% and 90.63%, respectively. 
After a median follow-up of 26.7 months for 1L patients (range: 16-39 months), the 12-month PFS 
was 100% and at 24 months, the PFS rate was 90.63%. 
Progression of disease occurred in 4 1L patients, 3 of whom had 17p del and/or TP53 mutation at 
baseline. Among the 22 1L fit patients, 3 (13.6%) had disease progression. Among the subset of 1L 
fit patients who did not have venetoclax treatment extended beyond 1 year, 1 patient out of 13 
(7.7%) had disease progression. 
•  MRD was negative (e.g., undetectable at a threshold  1 CLL cell per 10000 leukocytes) in peripheral 
blood of 90.6% (29/32) of 1L patients at least 3 months after the last obinutuzumab dose. 
Specifically, after at least 3 months from the last venetoclax dose, the rate of undetectable 
peripheral blood MRD was sustained at 71.9% (23/32) in the 1L patient population, 68.2% in the 1L 
fit population and 84.6% in the 1L fit population who did not have venetoclax treatment extended 
beyond 1 year. MRD responses were consistent regardless of cytogenetic subgroups and clinical 
fitness status. MRD-negativity was reported in bone marrow assessment in 78.1% (25/32) of 1L 
patients.

The efficacy outcomes (ORR and MRD negativity) were similar in all 1L group of patients analysed, 
including the 22 1L patients considered to be 'fit' and to have been potentially eligible to receive chemo-
immunotherapy (FCR or BR) as treatment prior to study entry. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal trial CLL14 was a randomized, multicenter, open label, phase 3 study that evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) versus obinutuzumab in 
combination with chlorambucil (GClb) for patients with previously untreated CLL with coexisting medical 
conditions (total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS] score > 6 or CLcr < 70 mL/min, but not inferior 
to 30 mL/min). All the patients included required therapy (Binet stage C or symptomatic disease). 
Patients with Richter’s transformation or any individual organ/system impairment score of 4 by CIRS were 
excluded. Since new treatment options were approved during the recruitment period, patients with TP53 
deletion or mutation were enrolled at the investigator’s discretion. Patients in the study were assessed for 
risk of TLS and received prophylaxis accordingly prior to obinutuzumab administration. All patients 
received obinutuzumab at 100 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed by 900 mg which could have been 
administered on Day 1 or Day 2, then 1000 mg doses on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of each 
subsequent cycle, for a total of 6 cycles. On Day 22 of Cycle 1, patients in the 
venetoclax + obinutuzumab arm began the 5-week venetoclax dose-titration schedule, continuing 
through Cycle 2 Day 28. Upon completion of the dose-titration schedule, patients continued venetoclax 
400 mg once daily from Cycle 3 Day 1 until the last day of Cycle 12. Each cycle was 28 days. Patients 
randomised to the obinutuzumab + chlorambucil arm received 0.5 mg/kg oral chlorambucil on Day 1 and 
Day 15 of Cycles 1-12. Patients continued to be followed for disease progression and overall survival after 
completing therapy. 
After a separate safety run-in, 432 patients were randomized 1:1. Cross-over was not allowed. All 
patients received obinutuzumab at 1000 mg on d1 (the first dose could be split as 100 mg and 900 mg on 
d1 and 2), and on d8 and 15 of cycle 1, and on d1 of each subsequent cycle, for a total of 6 cycles. 
Patients in the VEN+G arm began the 5-week venclyxto ramp-up schedule on d22 of cycle 1 and received 
venclyxto 400 mg once daily from cycle 3 d1 until the last day of cycle 12. Patients randomized to the 
GClb arm received 0.5 mg/kg oral chlorambucil on d1 and d15 of cycles 1 to 12. Each cycle was 28 days.  
The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS. The key secondary endpoints were IRC PFS, 
minimal residual disease negativity (allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase-chain-reaction with a cut-
off of 10−4) in peripheral blood and bone marrow, overall and complete response, MRD negativity in 
patients with complete response in PB and marrow (all assessed 3 months after treatment completion), 
and OS. Other secondary endpoints included DOR, EFS and time to new antileukemic treatment. 
Disease was assessed in all patients at baseline and at similar time points in both treatment groups 
during the trial, including an assessment of the response to therapy 3 months after the completion of 
treatment, with CR and PR defined in accordance with iwCLL 2008. After the completion of treatment, 
patients were followed for progression and safety every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months. 
MRD PB was performed at baseline and at cycles 7, 9, and 12, and then every 3 months. In patients with 
a treatment response, minimal residual disease in bone marrow was assessed at cycle 9 and 3 months 
after completion of treatment. 
An interim analysis was planned as per protocol to be performed after 110 progression events (65% of 
total planned events) had occurred. After IA data review (cut-off August 2018), IDMC recommended 
conducting the primary analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the study arms. The median 
age was 72 years (range: 41 to 89 years), 89% were white, 67% were male; 36% and 43% were Binet 
stage B and C, respectively and approximately half (49.8%) were experiencing B symptoms at baseline, 
with night sweats (43.5%) being the most frequent B symptom. The 88% of patients had ECOG 
performance status <2. The median CIRS score was 8 (range: 0 to 28) and 58% of patients had CLcr 
<70 mL/min. A 17p deletion was detected in 8% of patients, TP53 mutations in 7%, 11q deletion in 19%, 
and unmutated IgVH in 59.8%. The mutational status was unknown for 59 patients (27.3%) in the GClb 
arm and 45 (20.8%) in the VEN+G arm. Overall, the median time from first diagnosis of CLL to 
randomization was 2.5 years (0-20.4 years). TLS risk was categorized as low, medium or high and the 
risk categories were balanced between groups: 43 patients (20%) in the GClb arm and 48 (22.2%) in the 
VEN+G arm belonged to the high risk category). The majority of patients (66.2%) were considered as 
intermediate risk. In terms of prognosis, the CLL-IPI scores were similar for the two treatment arms; 
60% in the GClb arm and 60.4% in the VEN+G arm had a high score.  
Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by investigators and by an Independent Review Committee 
(IRC) using the International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) updated National 
Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) guidelines (2008). 
At the interim analysis, all patients were off-treatment for about 17 months. The PFS data can be 
considered immature, as the number of events in the control arm was low, 35.6% (13.9% in the 
experimental arm). The HR for progression or death is 0.35 (0.23-0.53). From around month 23 and on, 
extensive censoring is observed in the KM curves; a KM plot of time in study (from randomization to data 
cut-off) has been provided. The time in study is similar between the treatment arms, with the majority of 
patients having a follow-up over 39 months.  The robustness of the primary efficacy analysis however is 
supported by sensitivity analyses related to the censoring mechanism for PFS, unstratified analyses, and 
subgroup analyses (including TP53 mutations, deletions or both; and unmutated IgVH). 
At end of treatment visit, 123 patients (56.9%) in the VEN+G arm had achieved bone marrow MRD 
negativity and 163 (75.5%) peripheral blood MRD negativity, compared with 37 patients (17.1%) and 76 
patients (35.5%), respectively, in the GClb arm. Twelve months after the completion of treatment, MRD 
negativity rates in peripheral blood were 58% (126/216) in patients treated with VEN+G and 9% 
(20/216) in patients treated with GClb. In CR/CRi patients, the MRD-negativity rates at end of treatment 
were higher for VEN+G than for GClb: bone marrow 73 (33.8%) vs 23 (10.6%); peripheral blood: 91 
(42.1%) vs 31 (14.4%). In the MURANO study (RR CLL), the MRD status was similar regardless of clinical 
response; for completeness, data on MRD in PR were presented for study CLL14 and are similar to 
MURANO findings.  
In both arms of study CLL14, the patients who had reached PB MRD negativity at EOT had a longer 
duration of PFS compared with MRD positive patients. Dimier et al. published a model for predicting the 
effect of treatment on PFS using PB-MRD as a surrogate endpoint in treatment-naïve patients from 
studies CLL8, CLL10, and CLL11 (Blood. 2018 Mar 1;131(9):955-962). The model demonstrated a 
statistically significant relationship between treatment effect on PB-MRD and treatment effect on PFS. As 
the difference between treatment arms in PB-MRD response rates increased, a reduction in the risk of 
progression or death was observed; for each unit increase in the (log) ratio of MRD- rates between arms, 
the log of the PFS hazard ratio decreased by -0.188 (95% CI -0.321 to -0.055). A similar approach, i.e. 
evaluation of the relationship between treatment effect on PB-MRD and treatment effect on PFS for study 
CLL14 was presented by the MAH.  The available PFS and MRD data support an effect across cytogenetic 
subgroups and mutational status. The ORR (CR+CRi+PR) was 183 (84.7%) for VEN+G and 154 (71.3%) 
for GClb. The complete response rate (CR+CRi) was 107 (49.5%) vs 50 (23.1%).  
At the time of analysis, median overall survival had not been reached, with fewer than 10% of patients in 
the study experiencing an event. The median duration of follow-up for OS was 29 months.

The PFS benefit with venetoclax + obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab + chlorambucil treatment was 
observed across the following subgroups: sex; age; Binet stage at screening; estimated CrCL; 
del(17p)/TP53 mutation; IgVH mutational status.  
Although exploratory, the efficacy outcomes from study GP28331 (a 32 first-line patient subgroup) 
support the findings of the pivotal study CLL14. Noteworthy, the trial included 22 1L ¨fit¨ patients, who 
otherwise could have received a fludarabine-based regimen.   
At an updated efficacy analysis (data cut-off date 23 August 2019 and median follow-up of 40 months), 
the median PFS had not been reached in the venetoclax + obinutuzumab arm and was 35.6 months [95% 
CI: 33.7,40.7] in the obinutuzumab + chlorambucil arm with a HR of 0.31 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.44]. The 36-
month PFS estimate in the venetoclax + obinutuzumab arm was 81.9% [95% CI: 76.5, 87.3] and in the 
obinutuzumab + chlorambucil arm was 49.5% [95% CI: 42.4, 56.6]. 
The applicant is seeking an indication for first-line treatment of CLL regardless of fitness, including 
suitability for FCR. While the patients included in study CLL14, with a median age of 72 and a median 
CIRS score of 8, might be regarded as representative for most CLL patients, the comparator as well as 
the inclusion criteria exclude more fit patients. However, based on the precedent set for Imbruvica 
(ibrutinib), the extrapolation of efficacy also to younger and more fit patients is considered acceptable. 
This is since the safety profile in such patients is not anticipated to be less favourable; furthermore, the 
effect size, although not directly compared with FCR, is considered sufficient to make venetoclax + 
obinutuzumab a reasonable first-line treatment alternative, where the differential safety profile 
comparted to chemotherapy is notable. The inclusion criteria for the pivotal study (i.e. patients with 
coexisting conditions) are reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC and study GP28331 did include a small 
number of fit patients.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Venclyxto and obinutuzumab combination followed by venclyxto monotherapy offer longer progression-
free survival compared to chlorambucil and obinituzumab in a first-line CLL population that are either 
older than 65 years of age or have co-morbidities. The relevance of the efficacy demonstration can be 
extrapolated to more fit patients with CLL. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Patient exposure 
VEN+G was completed by 159 of the 203 who received both agents while VEN single agent treatment 
was completed by 166 of the 198 patients who started the single-agent period. The median duration of 
exposure to venetoclax, from first venetoclax dose, was 315 days (10.5 months). After reaching the 
target dose, the median dose intensity for venetoclax was 97.5% (range: 14%-100%).

Dose reduction or interruption 
Venetoclax 
• 
Interruption: 334 AEs leading to dose interruption of venetoclax were reported in 121 patients 
(57.1%). The most common AE that resulted in dose interruption of venetoclax was neutropenia 
(86 patients [40.6%]). No other AE leading to venetoclax dose interruption was reported in more 
than 5% of the patients in the VEN+G arm. 
•  Reduction: dose reductions due to AEs were reported in 43 patients (20.3%). The most common 
AEs (reported in 3 or more patients) that resulted in dose reduction of venetoclax were 
neutropenia (28 patients [13.2%]), neutrophil count decreased (4 patients [1.9%]), 
thrombocytopenia (4 patients [1.9%]). 
Obinutuzumab 
• 
Interruption: overall, 247 and 259 AEs leading to obinutuzumab dose interruption, respectively, 
were reported in 112 patients (52.3%) in the GClb arm and 119 (56.1%) in the VEN+G arm. The 
most common AEs that resulted in dose interruption of obinutuzumab were neutropenia (49 
patients [22.9%] in the GClb arm and 56 [26.4%] in the VEN+G arm) and infusion-related 
reaction (57 patients [26.6%] and 50 [23.6%], respectively). No other AE leading to 
obinutuzumab dose interruption was reported in more than 5% of patients in either arm. 
•  Reduction: obinutuzumab dose reductions were not allowed according to the protocol, but were 
reported in 2 patients (0.9%) in the GClb arm (due to AEs of IRR and neutropenia) and 3 (1.4%) 
in the VEN+G arm (due to AEs of IRR, nausea, fatigue and neutrophil count decreased). 
Chlorambucil 
• 
Interruption: 266 AEs leading to dose interruption of chlorambucil were reported in 121 patients 
(56.5%). The most common AEs that resulted in dose interruption of chlorambucil were 
neutropenia (83 patients [38.8%]) and thrombocytopenia (12 patients [5.6%]). No other event 
was reported in more than 5% of the patients. 
•  Reduction: Chlorambucil dose reductions due to AEs were reported in 17 patients (7.9%). The 
most common AEs (reported in 2 or more patients) that resulted in dose reduction of 
chlorambucil were neutropenia (13 patients [6.1%]), neutrophil count decreased (2 patients 
[0.9%]), and thrombocytopenia (2 patients [0.9%]). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Patients were withdrawn from venetoclax when toxicity could not be managed by dose interruption and 
dose reduction: 27 patients (12.7%) withdrew from venetoclax treatment due to AEs. The most common 
AEs that resulted in withdrawal of venetoclax were neutropenia (5 patients [2.4%]), sepsis (2 patients 
[0.9%]), and asthenia (2 patients [0.9%]). 
The percentage of patients who withdrew from obinutuzumab treatment was balanced between treatment 
arms (16 patients [7.5%] in the GClb arm and 15 [7.1%] in the VEN+G arm). The only AEs reported 
more than once in either treatment arm that resulted in withdrawal of obinutuzumab were neutropenia (2 
patients [0.9%] in the GClb arm and 1 [0.5%] in the VEN+G arm), thrombocytopenia (1 patient [0.5%] 
and 2 [0.9%], respectively), anaemia (2 patients [0.9%] and none, respectively), and infusion-related 
reaction (2 patients [0.9%] in both arms). 
Thirty-one patients (14.5%) withdrew from chlorambucil because of an AE. The most common AEs that 
resulted in withdrawal of chlorambucil were neutropenia (5 patients [2.3%]), neutrophil count decreased 
(2 patients [0.9%]), and infusion-related reaction (2 patients [0.9%]).

Infections > grade 3 
Second primary malignancies 
The incidence of second primary malignancies was 22 patients [10.3%] in the GClb arm compared with 
29 [13.7%] in the VEN+G arm. 
TLS 
There were 8 patients with AEs reported as TLS by the investigator, 5 (2.3%) in the GClb arm and 3 
(1.4%) in the VEN+G arm. All AEs in the VEN+G arm occurred prior to the first dose of venetoclax and 
were associated with obinutuzumab treatment. 
Richter’s transformation 
One patient in the GClb arm (timing not known) and 2 in the VEN+G arm (within 2 months of starting tx) 
developed Richter’s transformation. All 3 transformations were to DLBCL. 
Infusion-related reactions grade 3-4 (obinutuzumab) 
The incidence of gr 3-4 IRR was balanced between treatment arms: 10.7% in the GClb arm vs 11.8% in 
the VEN+G arm. No fatal IRRs were reported. Treatment for IRR was administered to 19 patients in each 
arm; 13 patients in each arm required interruption; 1 had an obinutuzumab dose reduction. 
Obinutuzumab was withdrawn due to IRRs in 2 patients in the GClb arm and 2 in the VEN+G arm. All but 
2 patients recovered with sequelae. One patient was recovering at the time of the cut-off.

The frequency of patients with SAEs was numerically higher in the experimental arm (104 patients 
[49.1%]) compared with the GClb arm (90 patients [42.1%]). 
The SOC with the most SAEs was Infections and infestations, with a numerically higher incidence in the 
VEN+G arm (40 patients [18.9%]) compared with the GClb arm (30 patients [14.0%]). By individual PT 
within this SOC, the largest difference occurred for sepsis (6 patients [2.8%] in the VEN+G arm and 2 
patients [0.9%] in the GClb arm).  
SAEs in the Blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC were reported in 17 patients (7.9%) in the GClb 
arm and 19 (9%) in the VEN+G arm. The 3 most frequent AEs in this SOC were febrile neutropenia 
(reported in 8 patients [3.7%] and 11 [5.2%], respectively), thrombocytopenia (5 patients [2.3%] and 2 
[0.9%], respectively), and neutropenia (1 patient [0.5%] and 3 [1.4%], respectively).  
SAEs in the Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified SOC were reported in 12 patients (5.6%) in the 
GClb arm and 15 (7.1%) in the VEN+G arm.   
The most frequently reported individual PTs were infusion-related reaction, 13 patients (6.1%) in the 
GClb arm and 9 (4.2%) in the VEN+G arm; pneumonia (9 [4.2%] and 10 [4.7%], respectively); febrile 
neutropenia (8 [3.7%] and 11 [5.2%], respectively) and pyrexia (7 [3.3%] and 8 [3.8%], respectively).  
The only SAE by grouped PT occurring in more than 5% of the patients in either arm was pneumonia (11 
patients [5.1%] in the GClb arm and 13 [6.1%] in the VEN+G arm).

Deaths 
During the treatment period (or within 28 days of last study drug) there were 3 deaths in the GClb arm 
and 5 patients in the VEN+G arm. After the end of the study treatment period: 13 in the GClb arm and 15 
in the VEN+G arm. Of the 13 post-treatment deaths in the GClb arm, 5 were due to disease progression, 
5 to fatal AEs, and 3 were attributed to ‘other’ causes (respiratory sepsis, sepsis and unknown). Of the 15 
post-treatment deaths in the VEN+G arm, 2 deaths were attributed to disease progression, 12 to fatal 
AEs and 1 to ‘other’ causes (reported as natural cardiac death). ’Other’ causes refer to deaths that were 
reported as a reason for study discontinuation; after patients had discontinued study treatment for other

reasons (i.e. disease progression or discontinued due to another AE). 
Fatal AEs 
The frequency of fatal AEs was numerically higher in the VEN+G arm (n=16 [7.5%]) than in the GClb 
arm (n=8 [3.7%]). The most frequently reported AE leading to death was sepsis (1 patient in the GClb 
arm and 5 patients in the VEN+G arm). Cardiac arrest was reported in 1 patient in each arm. 
Of the 16 patients who experienced Grade 5 AEs in the VEN+G arm, 2 patients (myelodysplastic 
syndrome and pneumonia fungal) discontinued obinutuzumab prior to receiving the first administration of 
venetoclax. In both cases, the investigator attributed a causal relationship to obinutuzumab. The other 3 
fatal events with onset during the treatment period were sepsis (2 patients) and infection (1 patient). The 
onset of the remaining 11 fatal AEs occurred in the posttreatment period, that is, 29 days or more after 
the last study drug administration: one case was attributed to venetoclax.  
In the GClb arm, of 8 patients with fatal AEs, 4 had onset during the treatment period, and 4 had onset in 
the post-treatment period. 
• 
Fatal infections 
In the experimental arm, 8 patients experienced fatal infection; of these, one did not receive venetoclax. 
In 4 patients, the fatal AEs occurred during the treatment period. One of them had Richter’s 
transformation after event onset and died after salvage treatment with RCHOP and allogeneic stem cell 
transplant. In the other 4 patients, onset of the fatal events was after the end of the treatment period: 
onset 73, 156, 235 and 346 days after the last dose of venetoclax, respectively. One of these patients 
died after diagnosis and treatment of T-cell lymphoma (with CHOP therapy). 
In the GClb arm, 3 patients experienced fatal events of infection, all of them with onset during the 
treatment period.  
•  Cardiovascular deaths 
Four patients in the VEN+G arm and 1 patient in the GClb arm experienced fatal cardiovascular AEs. All of 
these AEs after the treatment period and all patients had a relevant medical history. 
•  Deaths due to second primary malignancies

Description of Fatal and Second Primary Malignancies 
Laboratory findings 
Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities developing in ≥2% of patients treated with VEN+G included neutropenia 
(32%), leukopenia and lymphopenia (10%), thrombocytopenia (8%), hypocalcaemia (8%), 
hyperuricemia (7%), blood creatinine increased (3%), hypercalcemia (3%), and hypokalaemia (2%). 
Post-marketing experience 
No additional safety signals have been identified based on post-marketing data of venetoclax for the 
treatment of patients with CLL (from Periodic Safety Update Report for Venetoclax dated 3 August 2018).  
Between the international birth date (11 April 2016) and 04 June 2018, the estimated cumulative patient 
exposure from company-sponsored interventional clinical trials for venetoclax is 3,505 patients. The 
estimated cumulative post-marketing patient exposure since first approval is 3,244.7 patient-treatment

years. The MAH continues to actively monitor safety as part of the ongoing global pharmacovigilance 
program. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 426 patients were treated (212 with VEN+G, 214 with GClb). The median duration of exposure 
to venclyxto was 10.5 months (range: 0 to 13.5 months). The median number of cycles was 6 for 
obinutuzumab and 12 for chlorambucil.  
In the VEN+G arm, fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with 
onset within 28 days of the last study treatment were reported in 4/212 of patients vs. 2 /216 in GClb 
arm (all infections). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 49% of patients in the VEN+G arm and 
42% in the GClb arm.  
In the VEN+G arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients (15.4 in GClb), 
dose reduction in 21% (8.4% in GClb), and dose interruption in 74% (68% in GClb). In the VEN+G arm, 
neutropenia led to dose interruption of venclyxto in 41% of patients, reduction in 13%, and 
discontinuation in 2%. 
During treatment with single agent venclyxto after completion of VEN+G combination treatment, the 
most common all grade adverse reaction (≥10% patients) reported was neutropenia (26%). The most 
common grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥2% patients) were neutropenia (23%) and anaemia (2%). 
An analysis of gr≥3 SAEs in order to explore a possible relationship between organ/system morbidities at 
baseline and the risk of severe toxicity events in study CLL14 did not reveal any clear relationship. 
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia has been reported in patients treated with venetoclax in combination studies 
with rituximab or obinutuzumab and in monotherapy studies (see section 4.8). Complete blood counts 
should be monitored throughout the treatment period. Dose interruptions or reductions are recommended 
for patients with severe neutropenia (see section 4.2). 
Serious infections, including sepsis with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). Monitoring 
of any signs and symptoms of infection is required. Suspected infections are to receive prompt treatment, 
including antimicrobials and dose interruption or reduction as appropriate (see section 4.2). 
Dosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with the combination of 
venetoclax and obinutuzumab in the CLL14 study 
Deaths due to infection occurred in 1.9% of patients while on treatment and 1.9% of patients following 
treatment discontinuation. 
Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 74% of patients treated with the combination of 
venetoclax and obinutuzumab in the CLL14 study In the open-label, randomised phase 3 study (CLL14), 
the incidence of TLS was 1.4% (3/212) in patients treated with venetoclax + obinutuzumab. All three 
events of TLS resolved and did not lead to withdrawal from the study. Obinutuzumab administration was 
delayed in two cases in response to the TLS events. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety concerns for venclyxto were identified during in the pivotal and the supportive trial, 
respectively. However, the proposed regimen is not less toxic than chlorambucil and obinutuzumab, the 
current standard of care in previously untreated CLL patients with coexisting conditions. Neutropenia, 
leading to severe infections, dominates the safety profile of the venclyxto and obinutuzumab combination. 
A higher rate of fatal infections was observed for patients randomized to VEN+G. Section 4.4 of the SPC 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/166265/2020 
Page 68/80 
 
 
  
  
was amended to emphasize that neutropenic patients require constant monitoring for prompt 
identification of infection and aggressive treatment.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the SmPC section 5.3 has been updated 
based on the results of a 4-week dose ranging study, a 6-month carcinogenicity study and two embryo-
foetal development (EFD) studies in mice. Minor editorial changes have been introduced throughout the 
Product Information.  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable, because the changes to the package 
leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
CLL remains the most prevalent chronic leukaemia in clinical practice. The current International Working 
Group for CLL (iwCLL) 2018 guidelines recommend active surveillance until disease-related symptoms 
develop. The prognostic factors in CLL are largely based on recurrent molecular and cytogenetic 
abnormalities.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The field is evolving, with a number of drugs entering the relapsed/refractory setting and moving towards 
first-line, moreover with changes of recommendation category within previously untreated CLL. The role 
of MRD negativity in achieving deeper remissions and longer PFS (and ultimately overall survival) is 
taking centre stage in clinical trials. Both NCCN (latest version: 2020) and ESMO (2015, with an update in 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/166265/2020 
Page 75/80 
 
 
  
  
 
2017) segregate patients with and without del(17p)/TP53mut and fit from unfit. It is often said that 
elderly patients, who usually have a number of coexisting conditions of varying degrees of severity, 
require an effective, yet less toxic, treatment than the already available therapies. In 2019, FDA 
approved venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab (Gazyvaro) for previously untreated CLL (based on 
CLL14 trial), as well as ibrutinib + obinutuzumab for treatment-naïve CLL/SLL patients (based on the 
iLLUMINATE trial).   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal trial BO25323/CLL14 was a randomized, multicenter, open label, phase 3 study that evaluated 
the efficacy and safety of venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) versus obinutuzumab in 
combination with chlorambucil (GClb) for patients with previously untreated CLL with coexisting medical 
conditions (total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS] score > 6 or CLcr < 70 mL/min, but not inferior 
to 30 mL/min). All the patients included required therapy (Binet stage C or symptomatic disease). After a 
separate safety run-in, 432 patients were randomized 1:1. Cross-over was not allowed. All patients 
received obinutuzumab at 1000 mg on d1 (the first dose could be split as 100 mg and 900 mg on d1 and 
2), and on d8 and 15 of cycle 1, and on d1 of each subsequent cycle, for a total of 6 cycles. Patients in 
the VEN+G arm began the 5-week venclyxto ramp-up schedule on d22 of cycle 1 and received venclyxto 
400 mg once daily from cycle 3 d1 until the last day of cycle 12. Patients randomized to the GClb arm 
received 0.5 mg/kg oral chlorambucil on d1 and d15 of cycles 1 to 12. Each cycle was 28 days.  
The primary endpoint, Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by investigators and by an 
Independent Review Committee (IRC) using the International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia (IWCLL) updated National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) guidelines 
(2008). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At data cutoff, 30 (13.9%) PFS inv. events were registered in VEN+G arm vs 77 (35.6%) in GClb arm. Of 
those, 14, compared with 69, were events of disease progression. The HR for PFS-inv. was 0.35 (0.23-
0.53).  
At end of treatment visit, 123 patients (56.9%) in the VEN+G arm had achieved bone marrow MRD 
negativity and 163 (75.5%) peripheral blood MRD negativity, compared with 37 patients (17.1%) and 76 
patients (35.5%), respectively, in the GClb arm. Twelve months after the completion of treatment, MRD 
negativity rates in peripheral blood were 58% (126/216) in patients treated with VEN+G and 9% 
(20/216) in patients treated with GClb. In CR/CRi patients, the MRD-negativity rates at end of treatment 
were higher for VEN+G than for GClb: bone marrow 73 (33.8%) vs 23 (10.6%); peripheral blood: 91 
(42.1%) vs 31 (14.4%). 
The available PFS and MRD data support an effect across cytogenetic subgroups and mutational status. 
The CR was 107 (49.5%) vs 50 (23.1%); ORR 183 (84.7%) vs 154 (71.3%). At the time of the cut-off, 
less than 10% of the study population had an OS event. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although the maturity of PFS events is relatively low, and time-related secondary endpoints including OS 
are yet not informative, the treatment effect is adequately robust and consistent among subgroups; there 
are no uncertainties on the favourable effects.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
 In the VEN+G arm, fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with 
onset within 28 days of the last study treatment were reported in 4/212 of patients vs. 2 /216 in GClb 
arm (all infections).  
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 49% of patients in the VEN+G arm and 42% in the GClb arm.  
In the VEN+G arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients (15.4 in GClb), 
dose reduction in 21% (8.4% in GClb), and dose interruption in 74% (68% in GClb).  
In the VEN+G arm, neutropenia led to dose interruption of venclyxto in 41% of patients, reduction in 
13%, and discontinuation in 2%. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

patients 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
CLL patients, who usually have a number of coexisting conditions of varying degrees of severity, require 
an effective, yet less toxic, treatment than the already available therapies. In the pivotal study CLL14, 
PFS outcomes were supported by MRD results and other secondary endpoints. A fixed duration of one 
year of treatment seems sufficient to allow deep and prolonged control of disease. However, the proposed 
regimen is not less toxic than GClb. Although no new safety concerns for venclyxto were identified, 
neutropenia, leading to severe infections, some fatal, dominate the safety profile of the VEN+G 
combination. Nevertheless, as most infections can be managed adequately in the clinical setting if 
promptly identified and treated, the effect of the combination of venclyxto and obinutuzumab is 
considered to outweigh the risk of infection.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The applicant is seeking an indication for first-line treatment of CLL regardless of age or comorbidities. 
While the patients included in study CLL14, with a median age of 72 and a median CIRS score of 8, might 
be regarded as representative for most CLL patients, patients considered fit for e.g. FCR were not 
studied. However, extrapolation of efficacy also to younger and more fit patients is considered acceptable. 
This is since the safety profile in such patients is not anticipated to be less favourable; furthermore, the 
effect size demonstrated, although not directly compared with FCR, is considered sufficient to make 
venetoclax + obinutuzumab a reasonable first line treatment alternative, where the differential safety 
profile comparted to chemotherapy is notable. The inclusion criteria for the pivotal study (i.e. patients 
with coexisting conditions) are reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations 
acceptable and therefore recommends the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes: 
Variations accepted

approved one  
Extension of indication to include, in combination with an anti‐CD20 antibody (obinutuzumab), treatment 
of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) for Venclyxto based on 
the results of the pivotal CLL14/BO25323 phase 3 study; consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of 
the SmPC and corresponding sections of the PL have been revised. The updated RMP version 5.4 has 
been agreed. Additionally, the SmPC section 5.3 has been updated based on the results of a 4-week dose 
ranging study, a 6-month carcinogenicity study and two embryo-foetal development (EFD) studies in 
mice. Minor editorial changes have been introduced throughout the Product Information. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the group of variations, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to 
the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Venclyxto is not similar to Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab) and 
Imbruvica (ibrutinib) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See 
appendix 1. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the 
EPAR module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

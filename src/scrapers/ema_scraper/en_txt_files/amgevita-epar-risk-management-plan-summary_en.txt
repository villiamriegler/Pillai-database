PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for AMGEVITA (Adalimumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for AMGEVITA.  The RMP 
details important risks of AMGEVITA, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about AMGEVITA's risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
AMGEVITA's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) 
give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how AMGEVITA 
should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for AMGEVITA should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
AMGEVITA's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
AMGEVITA is authorized for rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial 
spondyloarthritis - ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis - axial spondyloarthritis 
without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, 
paediatric plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa (including adolescents from 
12 years of age), Crohn’s disease, paediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, uveitis, 
and paediatric uveitis (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains adalimumab as the 
active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of AMGEVITA’s benefits can be found in 
AMGEVITA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/medicines/human/EPAR/AMGEVITA. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further
characterize the risks  
Important risks of AMGEVITA, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about AMGEVITA's risks, are outlined below.

Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with 
or without prescription) can help to minimizes its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of AMGEVITA, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed including periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of AMGEVITA is not yet available, it 
is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A.  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of AMGEVITA are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of AMGEVITA.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

Important Identified Risk:  Malignancies 
Page 96 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
This important identified risk is included per the reference 
medical product Humira.  Evidence sources: Literature reports 
(Burmester et al, Arthritis Res Ther, 2014;16:R24:5-11; 
Burmester et al, Ann Rheum Dis, 2013;72:517-524); 
Humira SmPC, December 2018; Humira USPI, January 2019; 
and ABP 501 clinical studies of Rheumatoid Arthritis and 
Psoriasis. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Established risk factors for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are 
infection and immune dysregulation, immunosuppressed 
populations (those who had organ transplant, 
immunosuppressive medical treatment, and human 
immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome [AIDS]) and among individuals with certain 
auto-immune diseases (ie, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosis, psoriasis, Sjogren’s syndrome, and celiac 
disease, etc) (Zhang et al, Exp Opin Med Diagnost, 
2011;5(6):539-550).  Risk factors for Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
include genetic predisposition, Epstein-Barr virus infection, HIV 
infection and immune diseases (Mani and Jaffe, Clin Lymphoma 
Myeloma, 2009;9(3):206-216).   
Some events of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma reported with 
Humira have occurred in young adult patients on concomitant 
treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for 
inflammatory bowel disease (Humira SmPC, December 2018).  
Established risk factors for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma are 
similar to lymphoma and include infection and immune 
dysregulation.  The supportive evidences include elevated 
incidence rates in immunosuppressed populations (those who 
had organ transplant, immunosuppressive medical treatment, 
and HIV/AIDS) and among individuals with certain auto-immune 
diseases (ie, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, 
psoriasis, Sjogren’s syndrome, celiac disease, etc) 
(Zhang et al, Exp Opin Med Diagnost, 2011;5(6):539-550).   
Risk of leukemia may be higher in patients who are predisposed 
to this event, such as patients with a hematologic disorder (eg, 
severe congenital neutropenia) or an inherited disease (eg, 
Bloom syndrome and Fanconi’s anemia), patients who have had 
myelodysplastic syndrome for at least 3 months, or those who 
have been exposed to leukemogenic agents, often as a 
component of therapy for an unrelated neoplasm  
(Lowenberg et al, N Engl J Med, 1999;341:1051-1062).   
The risk of non-melanoma skin cancer and melanoma may be 
higher in patients who are predisposed to this event.  Significant 
risk factors for non-melanoma skin cancer include excessive, 
chronic sun exposure, indoor tanning, fair complexion, prior 
exposure to ionizing radiation, exposure to chemical 
carcinogens such as arsenic, and genetic determinants 
(Tung and Vidimos, Non melanoma skin cancer, Curr clin med:  
Expert Consult-Online, 2007; Miller and Weinstock, J Am Acad 
Dermatol, 1994;30:774-778).

measures 
Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities 
The strongest risk factors for melanoma are a family history of 
melanoma, multiple benign or atypical nevi, and a previous 
melanoma.  Immunosuppression, sun sensitivity, and exposure 
to ultraviolet radiation are additional risk factors.  Each of these 
risk factors corresponds to a genetic predisposition or an 
environmental stressor that contributes to the genesis of 
melanoma (Miller and Mihm, N Eng J Med, 2006;355:51-65).   
The risk of Merkel cell carcinoma may be higher in patients who 
are predisposed to this event, such as those with prior infection 
with Merkel cell polyomavirus, exposure to ultraviolet light (such 
as extended exposure to the sun, tanning beds, or in patients 
who received treatment for psoriasis), lighter skin tone, 
increasing age, men, patients with other cancers, and those with 
compromised immune systems (HIV infection, organ transplants)

Risk factors and risk groups  Multiple sclerosis arises from a combination of genetic 
susceptibility and environmental exposures acting from 
gestation to early adulthood.  Vitamin D deficiency, season of 
birth, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and smoking behavior are 
strongly implicated and able to influence genetic predisposition 
to multiple sclerosis (Disanto et al, CNS Neurol Disord Drug 
Targets, 2012;11(5):545-555).  No additional risk factors or risk

Risk factors and risk groups  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has been most 
commonly observed among patients infected with HIV, those 
with malignancies, and in organ transplant recipients.  
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has also been 
reported rarely in patients with inflammatory autoimmune 
disorders including rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic 
conditions, particularly in those using cytotoxic and biologic 
therapies including rituximab, natalizumab, efalizumab, and less 
commonly tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (Bharat et al, Arthritis

This important potential risk is included per the reference 
medical product Humira.  Evidence sources: Case reports and 
ABP 501 clinical studies of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriasis. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is often associated 
with an abrupt increase in blood pressure and is usually seen in 
patients with eclampsia, renal disease, and hypertensive 
encephalopathy.  It is also seen in the patients treated with 
cytotoxic and immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin, 
tacrolimus, and interferon alfa (Garg, Postgrad Med J, 
2001;77(903):24-28).  No additional risk factors or risk groups 
specific for patients treated with AMGEVITA are known.

Humira SmPC, December 2018. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Risk factors for colon cancer in ulcerative colitis patients include 
a long history of Crohn’s disease, often (but not exclusively) 
over 20 years predating cancer development; a relatively young 
age of intestinal cancer diagnosis in Crohn’s disease; and, the 
appearance of other histopathological types, including mucinous 
adenocarcinoma.  Most cancers occur in the distal colorectum, 
often in the presence of extensive inflammatory disease 
(Freeman, World J Gastroenterol, 2008;14(12):1810-1811).  No 
additional risk factors or risk groups specific for patients treated 
with AMGEVITA are known.

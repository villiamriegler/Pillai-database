and section 4.4 of the SmPC to add a warning on 
possible occurrence of DRESS syndrome with

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

involving parecoxib exposure. However, DRESS syndrome, 
although a rare event, is identified as a potential risk with 
parecoxib exposure since DRESS syndrome has been 
identified with celecoxib (parecoxib has a chemical 
structure very similar to that of celecoxib) and is a life-
threatening condition that may have a fatal outcome if the 
signs and symptoms are not recognized by a healthcare 
professionals. Therefore, parecoxib is contra-indicated in 
patient with history of previous serious allergic drug 
reaction of any type, especially cutaneous reactions such as

drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 
syndrome (DRESS syndrome). DRESS syndrome may occur 
with parecoxib exposure based on other serious skin 
reactions reported with celecoxib and valdecoxib exposure.

SmPC and PL 
The SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4  have been updated to add 
order to update the information on the use of 
parecoxib beyond 3 days based on a recent 
publication on the ‘Safety of parecoxib when used for 
more than 3 days for the management of 
postoperative pain’; this is an observatory study of 
the Pfizer clinical trial database to identify 
randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials in 
which patients could have, potentially, received 
parecoxib for longer than 3 days for the 
management of postoperative pain.  
cross-reference to section 5.1.  
The SmPC section 5.1 has been updated to include data on 
use of parecoxib beyond 3 days. Overall, the occurrence of 
adverse events in patients receiving parecoxib for 4-7 days 
(median duration 4 days) was low after treatment Day 3 
and similar to placebo. 
However, as the cardiovascular risk of (COX-2) specific 
inhibitors may increase with dose and duration of exposure, 
the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily 
dose of parecoxib should be used.

- SmPC: Administration of a single dose of parecoxib to 
lactating women following caesarean section resulted in the 
transfer of a relatively small amount of parecoxib and its 
active metabolite valdecoxib into human milk, and this 
resulted in a low relative dose for the infant (approximately 
1% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose). Dynastat must 
not be administered to women who breast-feed (see 
section 4.3). 
- PL: If you are breast-feeding, you must not receive 
Dynastat, as a small amount of Dynastat will be transferred 
to your breast milk.

parecoxib has been established in studies of dental, 
gynaecologic (hysterectomy), orthopaedic (knee and hip 
replacement) and coronary artery bypass graft surgical 
pain. Efficacy data from nine clinical studies conducted 
since the last renewal indicate that the efficacy of Dynastat 
remains unchanged. In the decade since the initial 
authorisation, the use of parecoxib has been associated 
with unwanted events which were not evident at the time 
of the marketing approval; the most notable being renal 
failure, myocardial infarction, and serious skin reactions 
including Stevens Johnson Syndrome. The safety sections 
of the product information have been revised accordingly. 
The off-label use of the product within a non-operative 
setting has been observed. The company will therefore 
follow-up on off-label use through pharmacovigilance 
activities and continue to closely monitor the following 
events in future PSURs: cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
events (thromboembolic and non-thromboembolic), 
haemorrhage events, and severe skin-related events. 
Based on the review of the data submitted for the renewal 
application, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk 
balance for parecoxib remains favourable.

may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular 
events. NSAIDs, including parecoxib, should be used with 
caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure 
should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy 
with parecoxib and throughout the course of therapy. Data 
from the literature show that there is an increased risk of

data of the class of medicnical products containing Cox-2 
inhibitors (celecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, parecoxib and 
valdecoxib), the CHMP concluded that an increased risk of 
CV adverse reactions was shown as a class effect and that 
there was an association between duration and dose of 
intake and the probability of suffering a CV reaction. 
Therefore, the CHMP decided, as a precautionary measure, 
to update the SPC through an Urgent Safety Restriction 
Procedure for the whole class of Cox-2 inhibitors. This Type 
II variation is the formal implementation of the changes in 
the SPC and PL for parecoxib.  
The adopted changes in the SPC are the following: 
Page 25/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
· 
A contra-indication is introduced in patients with 
established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular 
disease. 
· 
The warning on gastrointestinal adverse effects 
(gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal 
complications) has been strengthened.  
· 
A warning is introduced for prescribers to exercise 
caution when prescribing COX-2 inhibitors for patients with 
risk factors for heart disease, such as hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol levels), diabetes and 
smoking, as well as for patients with peripheral arterial 
disease. 
· 
A warning is introduced for prescribers to exercise 
caution when prescribing   NSAIDs, including valdecoxib, in 
combination with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists. 
· 
Information on long-term studies for valdecoxib in 
SAP and Alzheimer's disease has been included. 
To reflect these above-mentioned changes in the SPC, 
section 2 "Before you are given" of the Package Leaflet 
have been updated accordingly.

the SPC is modified in order:  
- to state that patients receiving parecoxib are apparently 
at a higher risk for serious skin reactions early in the 
course of therapy,  
- to mention that erythema multiforme has been associated 
with the use of valdecoxib and cannot be ruled out for 
parecoxib,  
- to include additional symptoms for which the 
Page 26/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration of parecoxib should be discontinued (e.g. 
mucosal lesions, other signs of hypersensitivity),  
- to reflect that patients without a history of sulphonamide 
allergy may also be at risk for serious skin reactions. 
- and to include that the frequency of serious skin reactions 
with valdecoxib is higher than with other COX-2 selective 
inhibitors. 
Section 4.8. "Undesirable events" of the SPC is amended to 
include that erythema multiforme has rarely been reported 
in association with the use of parecoxib.

general surgery patients; and from CABG I study, 
evaluated as part of the original MAA were presented.  
Increased cardiovascular thromboembolic events have been 
observed with high-dose valdecoxib in both cardiovascular 
surgery CABG studies. However, in the general surgery 
study, there were no differences in the overall safety 
profile. It has to be noted that the post-surgical use of 
valdecoxib in these settings is not approved in the EU.The 
CHMP agreed that the following sections of the SPC should 
be updated: 
- Section 4.3. "Contraindications": should mention that 
Dynastat should be contraindicated for the treatment of 
post-operative pain following CABG surgery, 
- Section 4.4. "Special warnings and precautions for use": 
has been amended to strengthen the wording on serious 
skin reactions, 
- Section 4.8. "Undesirable events": has been modified in 
order to clearly state that patients taking Dynastat 
Page 27/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following CABG surgery are at a higher risk of 
cardiovascular /thromboembolic events and deep surgical 
infections, 
- Section 5.1. "Pharmacodynamic properties": has been 
amended in order to present more clearly and in more 
detail the safety information from the CABG studies, and 
separately, the information from the General Surgery 
Study.

period from 01.10.2002 to 31.03.2003, the MAH submitted 
a type II variation to update: 
- sections 4.4 "Special warnings and special precautions for 
use", 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC), to indicate that hypersensitivity 
reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema), 
congestive heart failure and acute renal failure have 
occurred with parecoxib.  
- section 6.2 . "Incompatibilities" of the SPC, in order to
highlight that Dynastat should not be injected into 
an i.v. line delivering any other drug. Following PSUR2, 
incompatibilities with Ondansetron (antiemetic drug), if 
given intravenously after parecoxib (leading to 
precipitation), have been reported. 
In addition, section 6.6 "Instructions for use and handling 
and disposal" of the SPC has also been modified to provide 
clarification on reconstitution.

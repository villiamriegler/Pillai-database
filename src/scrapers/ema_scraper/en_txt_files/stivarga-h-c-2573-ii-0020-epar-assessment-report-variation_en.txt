Disease or condition 
The company applied for the following indication:  
Hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  in  adult  patients  who  have  been  previously  treated  with  one  systemic 
therapy. 
Epidemiology 
HCC  is  a  cancer  that  usually  occurs  in  the  setting  of  liver  cirrhosis,  because  of  chronic  infections  with 
hepatitis  B  virus  or  hepatitis  C  virus,  alcohol  consumption,  non-alcoholic  steatohepatitis,  or  diabetes 
(EASL&EORTC 2012).  
It is the third-leading cause of cancer-related death, and the global incidence is rising, with approximately 
700,000 cases diagnosed worldwide in 2012 alone (Lozano et al. 2010, Torre et al. 2015). 
In the US, the incidence of HCC is approximately 9.18 per 100,000 persons, in Southern Europe 9.8/3.2, 
in  Western  Europe  7.2/2.1,  and  in  Northern  Europe  3.8/1.6  (male/female,  respectively)  per  100,000 
persons  (Jemal  et  al.  2011).  The  incidence  of  HCC  is  rising  in  the  last  decennia  and  it  varies 
geographically largely due to variations in the incidences of hepatitis B and C infection, with the majority 
of  the  cases  (>  80%)  occurring  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  and  eastern  Asia.  One  country  alone,  China, 
accounts for 40% to 50% of worldwide cases. 
Management 
Individual  treatment  decisions  largely  depend  on  the  stage  of disease,  but  not  on its  aetiology.  Surgical 
resection,  transplantation,  and  ablation  are  potential  curative  options  for  early-stage  disease,  whereas 
chemoembolisation is recommended for patients with preserved liver function and disease confined to the 
liver  generally  without  vascular  invasion.  In  most  HCC  patients,  the  disease  is  diagnosed  at  advanced 
stages,  when  curative  treatments,  including  resection,  liver  transplantation,  and  ablation,  are  no  longer 
suitable.  For  patients  who  are  not  or  who  are  no  longer  candidates  for  loco  regional  therapy,  the  oral 
multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only systemic treatment currently approved in the EU. The approval 
was  based  on  the  results  of  a  large  Phase-3  clinical  trial  (Study  100554  SHARP)  conducted  in  602  HCC 
patients  (Llovet  et  al.  2008).  The  study  demonstrated  significantly  increased  survival  under  sorafenib 
(plus  BSC)  compared  to  placebo  (plus  BSC)  (HR  0.69;  p=0.0005),  with  a  median  survival  rate  for  the 
sorafenib  arm  of  10.6  months,  compared  with  7.9  months  for  the  placebo  arm.  Another  trial  (Study 
11849)  similarly  designed  as  SHARP  and  conducted  in  Asian  subjects,  confirmed  the  favourable  SHARP 
results (Cheng et al. 2009). Subgroup analyses from studies conducted with sorafenib have demonstrated 
that  the  survival  benefit  of  sorafenib  is  independent  of  the  underlying  aetiology  of  liver  disease  and 
independent  of  prior  treatments  such  as  TACE  (transarterial  chemoembolization)  which  is  usually 
administered  in  intermediate-stage  HCC.  Other  compounds  (e.g.,  the  anti-PD1  antibody  nivolumab,  the 
multiple TKIs lenvatinib and tivantinib) are currently tested in clinical trials as first line treatment options 
in comparison with sorafenib. 
Currently, there is no second-line treatment approved for HCC patients whose disease has progressed 
under first-line sorafenib treatment. All recent global Phase-3 trials with novel agents (e.g., brivanib, 
ramucirumab, everolimus) in second-line systemic treatment of patients with advanced HCC who 
progressed during sorafenib treatment have failed to meet their primary endpoint of survival 
improvement. Based on the placebo-arm data from these trials, it can be estimated that patients 
progressing under sorafenib treatment have a median life expectancy of about 7-8 months if left 
untreated. Therefore there is a clear unmet medical need for this patient population.

Regorafenib is an oral tumour deactivation agent that potently blocks multiple protein kinases, including 
kinases involved in tumour angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2), oncogenesis (KIT, RET, RAF-1, BRAF, 
BRAFV600E), metastasis (VEGFR3, PDGFR, FGFR) and tumour immunity (CSF1R). In particular, 
regorafenib inhibits mutated KIT, a major oncogenic driver in gastrointestinal stromal tumours, and 
thereby blocks tumour cell proliferation. Regorafenib was approved in the EU on 26 August 2013 as 
Stivarga 40 mg, film-coated tablets for the treatment of adult patients with  
•  metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have been previously treated with, or are not 
considered candidates for, available therapies. These include fluoropyrimidine-based 
chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy and an anti-EGFR therapy (see section 5.1).  
• 
unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) who progressed on or are 
intolerant to prior treatment with imatinib and sunitinib. 
With this variation application, the results of a Phase 3 trial (RESORCE study) are submitted, supporting 
the extension of indication to patients with HCC after sorafenib. 
No addendum to the non-clinical part of the dossier is submitted with this application since preclinical 
data, i.e. activity of regorafenib in the respective animal model (hepatoma in mice) were already part of 
the approved nonclinical dossier for Stivarga. The Environmental Risk Assessment has been updated 
based on the expected wider use of Stivarga due to the new indication. 
An RMP (version 5.0) has been provided which covers the new indication with this variation. The adult 
indication of this extension is covered by a respective paediatric class waiver. Furthermore, the Applicant 
has included a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
(Nexavar (INN: sorafenib tosylate) in the HCC condition.

2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable.  
With regards to the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA), regorafenib is a Persistent, Bioaccumulative 
and toxic (PBT) substance. A risk to the sediment and surface water compartment is identified. A risk to 
the sewage treatment plant (STP), soil and groundwater compartments is not identified.  
Hence, the following statement is provided in section 5.3 of the SmPC:  
“Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that regorafenib has the potential to be persistent, 
bioaccumulative and toxic to the environment and may pose a risk to the surface water and to the 
sediment compartment (see section 6.6).”  
Because of the expected risks of regorafenib to the surface water and sediment compartment and the PBT 
characteristics of the substance, all measures possible to prevent release of the substance to the 
environment should be taken. 
The updated data submitted in this application lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure 
further to the use of regorafenib.  
Therefore, considering the above data, regorafenib should be used according to the precautions stated in 
the SmPC and section 5 of the package leaflet in order to minimise any potential risks to the 
environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The proposed dose regimen of regorafenib for HCC is 160 mg qd for 3 weeks /1 week off. This is the 
same dose regimen currently approved for mCRC and GIST. 
New clinical pharmacology data obtained in the analyses based on data from Study 15982 (RESORCE) 
have been submitted. Sparse data sampling was conducted and the pharmacokinetic analyses consist of a 
population PK (popPK) and covariate model-based analysis comprised of a total of 16 regorafenib studies 
including the RESORCE trial and an exploratory analysis of the exposure-response relationships in the 
RESORCE trial. 
Two metabolites of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5, have demonstrated in vitro pharmacologic activity similar 
to that of unchanged regorafenib. Therefore, the evaluation of metabolite PK for M-2 and M-5 was 
included in all PK studies. 
A summary of key pharmacokinetic parameters of regorafenib and metabolites M-2 and M-5 in patients 
with mCRC and GIST is provided in the table below.

PopPK analysis 
A previously developed popPK model for regorafenib (“the integrated PK model”; R-8931) was applied to 
the PK data collected in Study 15982. Data from 16 studies were included in the popPK model. It consists 
of two sub-models, a parent PK sub-model and a metabolite PK sub-model (see figure below). The 
objectives were to determine the PK in patients with HCC and calculation of individual exposure estimates 
based on the empirical Bayes’ estimates derived and second to evaluate the exposure-covariate 
relationships across 16 clinical regorafenib. 
Population PK analyses were performed by means of non-linear mixed-effects modelling using NONMEM 
(version 7.2; Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Maryland, USA). Diagnostic graphics, exploratory 
analyses, and post-processing of NONMEM output was performed using S-Plus (version 8.2 Professional, 
Insightful Corp., Seattle, USA). The covariate analysis was performed using R (version 3.2.2, The R 
foundation for Statistical Computing) and RStudio (Version 0.99.486, RStudio Inc, Boston, USA). 
Figure 1: Schematic representation of the final popPK model of regorafenib and its metabolites M2 and M5 
In study 15982, blood samples for PK analysis of regorafenib and its metabolites M-2 and M-5 were 
collected from all subjects pre-dose on Day 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 2. In a 
subset of patients, an additional sample was collected on the same days between 2 and 4 h post-dose, 
i.e. around the time of the expected (daily) maximum concentrations of regorafenib. 
To ensure timely delivery of the exposure estimates for the exposure-response modelling and the 
(multivariate) covariate analysis, the analysis started prior to database lock, when concentration data 
from approximately 80% of the patients were available. Once the data for all patients became available, 
the same analysis was performed again for the 100% population. The comparison of the distributions of

the estimated exposures to regorafenib (parent and total) in the 80% popPK population and in the 100% 
population investigated later showed that the regorafenib exposure was very similar in the two 
populations. Since the two populations were also similar with regards to demographic and baseline 
disease characteristics, it can be assumed that the results of the covariate analyses based on the 80% 
dataset can be extrapolated to the whole population. The 80% dataset consisted of 2534 observations 
from 276 subjects. These 2534 observations were almost equally distributed among regorafenib, M-2 and 
M-5 (846, 828 and 860 observations, respectively). The 100% dataset consisted of 3210 observations 
from 339 subjects.  The actually administered dose (i.e. 160 mg, corresponding to no dose reduction, 120 
or 80 mg, corresponding to a dose reduction, or 0 mg, corresponding to a dose interruption/delay, 
including the 7 days off drug), and dosing time were implemented based on the start- and end-date and 
available dose information from the clinical dataset. The number of subjects per dose level is summarised 
in the table below. 
Table 3. Number of subjects at time point of exposure calculation (popPK analysis R-1108 complete 
dataset) 
In the popPK covariate analysis across 16 studies (R-11104), subject status (patient or healthy 
volunteer), sex, age, BMI, and haemoglobin / albumin at baseline (HB0 / ALB0) were identified as having 
a statistically significant influence on exposure to regorafenib parent.  The impact of these covariates on 
regorafenib exposure is graphically illustrated in Figure 2 for the population of cancer patients.   
Age and haemoglobin at baseline significantly increased both the exposure of parent and the total 
nominal exposure (regorafenib+M-2+M-5). Of the 1337 subjects in the popPK analysis, 117 subjects 
were ≥75 years of age. An increase in 10 years of results in 3.8% and 4.9% increase in parent and the 
total nominal exposure, respectively.  
BMI and plasma albumin (ALB0) at baseline increased the parent nominal exposure but not the total 
nominal exposure. An increase in BMI of 5 kg/m2 results in 4.7% increase in parent nominal exposure. 
Body weight and the liver enzymes ALT (ALT0) at baseline had a decreasing effect on the total nominal 
exposure but no significant influence on parent nominal exposure. An increase in body weight of 10 kg 
results in 3.1% decrease in total nominal exposure.

Results 
HCC population 
The PK parameters in patients with HCC from study 15982 are summarised in the table below. 
Table 4: PK parameters of regorafenib, M-2, M-5 and free aggregate as estimated averages over the first 
cycle or first two cycles in HCC patients (study 15982) 
Figure 3 shows that the individual exposure to regorafenib parent was similar in HCC patients and CRC 
patients and slightly higher than the exposure in GIST patients. However, the exposures observed in 
GIST patients were completely within the range of the exposures observed in CRC and HCC patients, 
indicating that the exposure to regorafenib parent was very similar in the three patient populations.

In addition, effect of hepatic function on PK of regorafenib was graphically explored. In study 15982, only 
6 patients were classified as Child-Pugh B at baseline and PK data were available for only one. Across all 
studies with HCC patients (15982, 14596, 11651), PK data for 5 patients with Child-Pugh B and 318 
patients with Child-Pugh A were available. Exposure in subjects with Child-Pugh class B function was 
comparable to that in patients with Child-Pugh class A function and that in patients with normal liver 
function (Figure 4). However a quantitative assessment could not be made because of the limited number 
of patients with Child-Pugh class B function. For 76 of 373 patients, their HCC was attributed to alcohol 
consumption. No notable impact of this factor was observed on the PK of regorafenib.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Regorafenib is an oral anti-tumour agent that can inhibit multiple protein kinases, including kinases 
involved in tumour angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2), oncogenesis (KIT, RET, RAF-1, BRAF, 
BRAFV600E), and the tumour microenvironment (PDGFR, FGFR). In preclinical studies, regorafenib has 
demonstrated anti-tumour activity in a broad spectrum of tumour models including colorectal cancer 
models. Major human metabolites (M-2 and M-5) exhibited efficacy similar to regorafenib in both in vitro 
and in vivo models.   
Biomarkers 
In the RESORCE trial, retrospective explorative biomarker analyses are in progress aiming to identify 
biomarker candidates which might help to predict response to regorafenib. 
The following types of correlative biomarker analyses are in progress:

• 
Expression data from approximatively 800 circulating miRNA isolated from plasma at baseline 
from subjects who granted genetic consent to identify individual miRNAs or miRNA signatures 
associated with the clinical endpoints OS and TTP. 
•  Determination of an immune profile on the basis of targeted gene expression on archival tumor 
tissue samples from approximately 65 subjects subjected to analysis  
•  Determination of the tumour mutational landscape using targeted Next-Generation DNA 
sequencing on archival tumor tissue samples from approximatively 22 subjects subjected to 
analysis 
The results of the correlative biomarker analyses will be reported in separate non-genetic and genetic 
biomarker reports. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The objective of the exploratory exposure-response (PKPD) analysis for Study 15982 was to assess the 
relationship between the exposure to regorafenib and its two pharmacologically active metabolites M-2 
and M-5 on the one hand and efficacy- and safety-related responses on the other hand in HCC patients. 
For this purpose, different exposure parameters, which were estimated using a popPK model and various 
efficacy and safety variables, were correlated. In the absence of studies generating data comparable to 
those of Study 15982, the analysis was based on the data from Study 15982 only. A univariate (report 
PH-39209) and a multivariate (report PH39309) analysis were conducted.  
The PK/PD population included 337 patients, 297 men (88.1%) and 40 women (11.9%). The median age 
was 64.0 years (range: 19 to 85 years). Approximately 40% of the subjects were Asians and 40% were 
non- Asians (ethnicity not reported: approx. 20%). For 76 of 337 patients (22.6%), their HCC was 
attributed to alcohol consumption. 
For the univariate analysis, subgroups for analyses were defined based on exposure quartiles. For each 
parameter, the subjects were assigned to three mutually exclusive exposure groups defined as follows: 
low = 1st quartile, medium = 2nd and 3rd quartiles, high = 4th quartile of the respective exposure 
parameter. Exposure, defined as the average concentration (CAV) during the time interval, was estimated 
for regorafenib parent and for the sum of regorafenib parent, M-2, and M-5 concentrations corrected for 
differences in molecular weight and protein binding (free aggregate). Given the low peak-trough 
fluctuation at steady-state, the average concentration is an adequate parameter to describe the extent of 
exposure to regorafenib and its active metabolites. 
There were some minor imbalances in demographic and baseline characteristics among the three 
exposure groups: there were more females in the high exposure group than in the two other groups 
(27% vs ≤ 10% in the other two groups) and the percentage of mainland Chinese patients was higher in 
the high exposure group than in the other two groups (42% vs ≤20% in the other two groups) (see Table 
5). Also baseline disease characteristics ECOG status 1 and percentage of patients with increased levels 
of AST/ALT was slightly higher in the low exposure group.

mainland China. 
Exposure-effect relationships 
Univariate analysis indicated that there was a trend towards shorter OS in the low exposure group 
compared to the medium and high exposure group. The median survival times for subjects in low, median 
or high exposure groups (free aggregate) were 261, 374 or 499 days, respectively, with the median 
survival of 343 days (N=329) for the overall population. The median overall survival in the placebo group 
in the RESORCE trial was 237 days (95% CI: 192, 269 days; N = 194).

Table 6: Study 15982 – median overall survival (OS) [days] by exposure to regorafenib parent and free 
aggregate 
There were no consistent differences between exposure groups regarding time to progression (TTP). 
When the subjects were grouped by exposure in Cycle 1 (parent and free aggregate), the lowest median 
TTP was seen in the low exposure groups (Table 7). When the subjects were grouped by exposure in 
Cycles 1 plus 2, the relation was inverted, i.e. the longest median TTP was seen in the low exposure 
groups. In both cases, the 95% CIs were largely overlapping.

free aggregate 
Source: PH 39209, Section 14, Table 4/7 to Table 4/12. 
The exposure-response relationship for Overall Survival (OS) was further investigated using multivariate 
Cox proportional regression analysis to evaluate the correlation between exposure quartiles and efficacy 
while taking the effect of predefined baseline covariates into consideration. Table 8 shows that Cox 
proportional-hazard analysis identified three significant baseline risk factors for OS: ECOG performance 
score (p < 0.001), AFP baseline value (AFP category, p < 0.001) and hepatic function according to 
AST/ALT baseline levels (AST/ALT levels > 3 times the upper limit of normal, p < 0.001).  While no 
statistically significant exposure-response relationship could be identified between (continuous) individual 
exposure for OS in the regorafenib group, the analysis of the exposure-response relationship shows a 
trend for OS to increase with increasing exposure to regorafenib.

In addition, OS in average dose subgroups of <140 mg and ≥140 mg was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier 
analysis. Results from these (exploratory) analyses are provided in Table 9. The OS was shorter in the 
regorafenib group with an average dose <140 mg (median of 224 days in 99 subjects) versus a median 
of 360 days in 275 subjects in the ≥140 mg average dose group. For the placebo group, a substantial 
difference in OS between the <140 mg average dose group and the≥140 mg average dose group was 
observed also, with a median of 47 (18 subjects) and 248 (175 subjects) days, respectively.

Exposure – safety relationships 
The number of subjects with, as well as the incidence of any ≥ Grade 3 TEAE, any TESAE, and individual 
AEs of asthenia/fatigue, diarrhoea, HFSR, haemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, hypertension, 
mucositis, liver failure, rash, and elevated ALT, AST, total bilirubin and changes in platelet counts were 
investigated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017 
Page 22/91 
 
  
  
 
 
The analyses demonstrated that there were no correlations between selected relevant TEAEs (total and ≥ 
NCI CTCAE Grade 3) and exposure to regorafenib or free aggregate when considering Cycle 1 as well as 
TEAEs reported for the whole treatment period and drug exposure in Cycle 1 plus 2.  
A trend for an exposure-dependent increase was observed for the number of subjects with elevated total 
bilirubin and for total events of mucositis (mostly driven by events of Grade 1 and few events of Grade 2 
and 3). Furthermore, a slight increase of total incidence of haemorrhage and decreased platelets was 
seen (mostly driven by Grade 1 and 2 events) and the total incidence for HFSR slightly increased with 
exposure to regorafenib and free aggregate which are also driven by an increase in Grade 1 and 2 events. 
Exposure – dose modification relationship 
The planned dose regimen for regorafenib (160 mg once daily, 3 weeks on / 1 week off) was modified for 
146 of 329 (evaluable) subjects in Cycle 1 (44.4%), for 216/329 subjects (65.7%) in Cycles 1 plus 2 and 
for 316/329 subjects (96.0%) during the whole treatment period. The median time to first modification 
(dose reduction or interruption/delay) was 16 days in the 146 subjects with dose modifications in Cycle 1. 
Any modifications and dose interruptions or delays were more common in the low exposure group than in 
the medium exposure group and in particular in the high exposure group. This is shown in Table 10 for 
exposure to free aggregate but the results were similar when the subjects were grouped by exposure to 
regorafenib parent. Subjects in the low exposure group experienced more TEAEs during the first cycle 
which resulted in dose modifications. The time to first interruption or delay during Cycle 1 was also 
shorter in the low exposure group and the number of subjects who discontinued regorafenib was higher in 
this group than in the two other groups (8/83 subjects (9.6%)) in the low exposure group vs 4/163 
subjects (2.5%) in the medium exposure group and 0/83 subjects (0%) in the high exposure group). The 
number of subjects with dose reductions and the time to first dose reduction was similar in the three 
groups. The primary reason for dose interruptions or delays was the occurrence of adverse events in all 
exposure groups. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that led to dose 
interruption in subjects randomized to regorafenib were diarrhoea, fatigue, AST increased, blood bilirubin 
increased, and HFSR.  
Table 10: Study 15982–dose modifications in Cycle 1 by exposure to free aggregate in Cycle1 
A subsequent analysis of the average dose groups stratified by no or at least one interruption/delay, 
shows that the average dose group with <140 mg with no interruption/delay has a shorter OS compared 
to the average dose group with <140 mg with at least one dose interruption/delay in both the placebo 
and the regorafenib treatment group.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Regorafenib is an oral anti-tumour agent that can inhibit multiple protein kinases, including kinases 
involved in tumour angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2), oncogenesis (KIT, RET, RAF-1, BRAF, 
BRAFV600E), and the tumour microenvironment (PDGFR, FGFR).  
In study 15982 (RESORCE), regorafenib is given after treatment with sorafenib has failed. Though it 
seems counter-intuitive to initiate a treatment with a multikinase inhibitor after another multikinase 
inhibitor has failed, there is increasing evidence that sequential use and switch upon progression of 
multikinase inhibitors with partially overlapping but distinct kinase inhibitor profiles is associated with 
clinical benefit and prolongation of survival.  In renal cell cancer and GIST, sequential use of several 
multikinase inhibitors such as imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, or axitinib has become an element of the 
standard of care in these patients. The findings from the RESORCE trial of a significantly increased 
survival compared to placebo in HCC patients after prior treatment with sorafenib is therefore consistent 
with the data regarding the clinical benefit of multikinase inhibitor sequence treatments in RCC and GIST. 
For the current application in HCC, pharmacokinetic data of regorafenib was obtained in the pivotal phase 
3 study 15982 (sparse PK data). The original popPK analysis based on 14 studies including the phase 3 
studies for mCRC and GIST was updated with data from the pivotal study 15982. Further an exploratory 
exposure-response analysis for both efficacy and safety was conducted for the Phase 3 study 15982.  
The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib are comparable between HCC and mCRC patients. Exposure of M-2 
and M-5 in HCC patients seemed somewhat lower than in CRC patients but high inter-individual variability 
in exposure of these active metabolites was observed (Table 4).  
The limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with Child-Pugh B (N=6) do not indicate a different exposure 
to regorafenib, data on M-2 and M-5 were not reported. It is agreed that the data are too limited to 
provide a recommendation for starting dose in section 4.2 for Child-Pugh B. During treatment with 
regorafenib, ~30% of the patients became classified as Child-Pugh B, and dose reductions are proposed 
for liver function (ALT, AST and bilirubin), which should be controlled on regular basis. This is adequately 
addressed in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC.  
In the phase 3 study 15982, exposure-efficacy analysis showed a trend for longer OS but not TTP with 
higher regorafenib exposure. Previously, no correlation between exposure and efficacy was observed for 
mCRC and GIST. HCC patients with the lowest regorafenib exposure had a lower average dosage due to 
dose reductions and more dose interruptions than patients with higher regorafenib exposures. Further, 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017 
Page 24/91 
 
  
  
 
 
 
the percentage of subjects with baseline ECOG status 1 was higher in subjects with lower average dosage 
in cycle 1 compared to subjects with 160 mg dosage in both the placebo as the regorafenib group. In 
addition, patients with a lower average dose seemed to withdraw more frequently. Both in the placebo 
and regorafenib group patients with a lower average dosage had a shorter OS. Hence, the trend for 
longer OS with higher regorafenib exposure can be explained (in part) by differences in baseline 
characteristics regarding performance status and subsequently dose interruption, reductions and study 
withdrawal. This is in agreement with the COX multivariate analysis, where ECOG performance score, AFP 
baseline value and hepatic function according to AST/ALT baseline levels were significant baseline risk 
factors for OS.  
There were no correlations between selected relevant TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 and regorafenib exposure. A 
trend for an exposure-dependent increase was observed for the number of subjects with elevated total 
bilirubin and for total events of mucositis and rash (mostly driven by events of Grade 1 and few events of 
Grade 2 and 3).  Furthermore, a slight increase of total incidence of haemorrhage and decreased platelets 
was seen (mostly driven by Grade 1 and 2 events). This is consistent with the exposure-toxicity 
correlations observed in mCRC and GIST patients. 
Exploratory biomarker analysis to potentially identify mechanisms involved and to select patients who 
benefit most from regorafenib treatment is ongoing; results from the non-genetic analyses have been 
provided during review and the results on the genetic biomarker analyses will be submitted by the MAH 
once available.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package for the extension of indication for treatment of patients with HCC, who 
have been previously treated with one systemic therapy, is considered acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
In support of this type II variation application, to extend the use of regorafenib to patients with HCC who 
have been previously treated with one systemic therapy the MAH has submitted one pivotal Phase III 
15982 (RESORCE) study. In addition, the results of the phase II 14596 study, also conducted in patients 
with HCC (in EU and South Korea) after failure (defined as radiological progression) of sorafenib 
treatment has been presented as supportive.  
The proposed dosing regimen of regorafenib (160 mg orally OD (i.e., once daily) according to a 3 weeks 
on followed by 1 week off schema) in patients with HCC pre-treated with sorafenib is in line with the 
already approved indication in metastatic colorectal cancer and GIST.

enrolment. 
- Permanent discontinuation of sorafenib due to toxicity, or with tolerability of prior treatment with 
sorafenib less than 20 days at a minimum daily dose of 400 mg QD within the last 28 days prior to 
withdrawal as well as with any other prior systemic treatment for HCC (excluding sorafenib).

- Proteinuria, uncontrolled pleural effusion/ascites, presence of non-healing wounds, ulcer or bone 
fracture, any kind of malabsorption, interstitial lung disease, pheochromocytoma and previous liver 
transplantation. 
Treatments 
Patients were to receive either regorafenib or matching placebo 160 mg (4 x 40 mg tablets) OD orally for 
3 weeks followed by 1 week off therapy (cycle of 4 weeks) plus BSC (Best Supportive Care). Doses of 
study drug were to be taken following a light meal.  
Up to two regorafenib dose-reductions due to toxicity were allowed (from 160 mg to 120 mg to 80 mg. 
Biomarker analyses on whole blood and plasma samples and archived diagnostic tumour biopsies were 
performed (voluntary patients with a separate consent). 
Patients were treated until disease progression according to mRECIST or RECIST 1.1 criteria, clinical 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, and/or consent withdrawal. Dosing beyond disease progression was 
allowed under special circumstances (i.e. expected benefit by continued therapy) and in consultation with 
the sponsor. Cross-over was not allowed.  
Objectives 
Primary objective:  
To show superiority of regorafenib plus BSC versus placebo plus BSC in terms of Overall Survival (OS). 
Secondary objectives:  
Comparison between the two study arms of Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time to Progression (TTP), 
objective tumour response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR= CR+PR+SD).  
Tertiary objectives: 
Duration of objective response, duration of stable disease, evaluation of health related quality of life and 
utility values, safety and pharmacokinetics. A biomarker analysis was also included as exploratory. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
OS, defined as the time (days) from randomization to death due to any cause.  
Secondary endpoints: 
TTP: time [days] from randomization to radiological or clinical disease progression. 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017 
Page 27/91 
 
  
  
PFS: time [days] from randomization to first observed disease progression [radiological or clinical, as 
assessed by investigators] or death due to any cause, if death occurred before disease progression was 
documented. 
ORR: percentage of patients with complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] according to RECIST 
1.1 and the modified RECIST criteria. 
DCR: percentage of patients with CR, PR or stable disease [SD]. In order to be counted as a responder in 
DCR, stable disease had to be maintained for at least 6 weeks. Of note, the RECIST modified for HCC 
(mRECIST) does not include necrotic tissue into the measurement but only viable parts of tumour lesions. 
Tertiary endpoints: 
Duration of response: time from the first documented objective response of CR of PR, whichever was 
noted earlier, to disease progression or death [if death occurred before progression], in patients achieving 
CR or PR according to both RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST,  
Duration of stable disease: time from randomization to disease progression or death, calculated only in 
patients who failed to achieve CR or PR) 
Evaluation of patient reported outcomes (PROs) including evaluation of Health Related Quality of life 
(according to the FACT-Hep and the EQ-5D questionnaires). 
(Optional) biomarker analysis included evaluation of mutation of genes of interest (e.g., BRAF, KRAS, 
PI3KCA), expression of several genes (eg, VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, c-KIT, TIE2) on archival tumour biopsies 
and/or blood/plasma samples.  
Sample size 
The sample size was based on the primary efficacy endpoint (OS). The targeted improvement was a 43% 
increase in median OS compared to placebo (i.e. assuming a median OS under placebo of 8 months, the 
median OS under regorafenib was expected to be at least 11.4 months). The associated hazard ratio of 
regorafenib over placebo was 0.7. Approximately 370 events were required assuming a one-sided α = 
0.025, a targeted improvement in median survival of 43%, a power of 90%, and a randomization ratio of 
2:1 between regorafenib and placebo. Approximately 560 subjects were planned to be randomized in 
order to conduct the study in a reasonable time frame. The study data were to be considered mature and 
the final analysis performed after approximately 370 events (deaths) were observed. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either regorafenib or matching placebo. Randomization was 
performed through a computer generated randomization list prepared by the Sponsor Randomization 
Manager. The randomization number for each eligible patient was provided to the Investigators through 
an interactive voice recognition system (IVRS).  
Randomization was stratified by:  
1- Geographical region (Asia of Rest of the World);  
2- ECOG PS (0 vs 1);  
3- Alpha-feto protein (AFP) level (< 400 ng/mL vs ≥400 ng/mL);  
4- Presence vs absence of extra-hepatic disease;  
5- Presence vs absence of macrovascular invasion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017 
Page 28/91 
 
  
  
Blinding (masking) 
Patients were randomized to receive regorafenib or matching placebo in a double-blind fashion, i.e. 
neither the investigator, nor the sponsor, nor the patient knew which agent was being administered. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
All primary efficacy analyses were based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which comprised all randomized 
subjects, including subjects who withdrew regardless of the reason for withdrawal.  
The population for safety analysis comprised all patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
medication. 
Analysis methods 
The final analysis of OS was to be performed using a 1-sided overall α of 0.025 when approximately 370 
death events were observed. The hazard ratio (HR) for OS and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was to be 
calculated using the Cox model, stratified by the same factors as stated above. Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
estimates for OS and KM survival curves are presented for each treatment arm. Primary endpoint OS: 
Increase in median survival of 43%, 8.0 to 11.4 months; HR = 0.70. Significance level/power: 0.025 
(one-sided) / 90%. Accrual period: 22.2 months (first patient first visit [FPFV] to last patient first visit 
[LPFV]). Accrual rate 25 patients/month, ramp- up 3 months). Study duration 32.7 months (until primary 
completion). Total number of events: 370. Total number of patients required: 560. 
Interim analyses  
In the original protocol one formal interim futility analysis and one formal interim efficacy analysis for OS 
was planned to be conducted during the study and evaluated by a DMC. However only the interim 
analysis for futility was performed as the other one was removed with protocol amendment 4 as by the 
time of the formal interim efficacy analysis for OS and in case of a hypothetical premature study stop, 
enrolment would not yet have been completed.  
Handling of missing data 
Missing or unevaluable tumour assessments (including scheduled assessments that were not done and 
incomplete assessments that did not result in an unambiguous tumour response evaluation according to 
RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST criteria) were not used in the calculation of derived efficacy variables related to 
tumour assessments unless a new lesion occurred or the lesions that were evaluated already showed 
progressive disease. No imputation was performed for missing lesion assessments and tumour response 
evaluation. For example, if a subject missed a scan visit and progressive disease (PD) was documented at 
the next available scan visit, the actual visit date of the first documented PD was used to calculate PFS 
and TTP. If a date was incomplete, (e.g. only the year and month of the tumour assessment or if the date 
of death was available), then day 15 of the month was used for the calculation of, for example, OS and 
PFS. If the actual scan date of the radiological progression was missing and radiological or clinical 
progression had been documented based on the criteria specified in the protocol, the scheduled scan date 
was to be used to calculate the time to progression.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 6. Participant flow Cut-off 29-02-2016. 
Recruitment 
A total of 573 patients were randomized into the study (ITT population), between 14 May 2013 and 29 
February 2016, 379 in the regorafenib plus BSC group and 194 in the placebo plus BSC group, consistent 
with the planned 2:1 randomization. Five patients randomized to regorafenib and 1 randomized to 
placebo did not receive a single dose of study drug. Therefore, 567 patients received at least one dose of 
study medication and were included in the safety population.  
As of the 29 February 2016 cut-off date 75 patients (13.1%) were still on study (65 [17.2%] in the 
regorafenib arm and 10 [5.2%] in the placebo arm). Thus, a total of 492 (85.9%) patients in the ITT 
population had discontinued the study, 309 (81.5%) in the regorafenib group and 183 (94.3%) in the 
placebo group. 
The study was conducted at 152 study centers that enrolled patients in 21 countries. The participating 
countries were (number of centers in brackets): Japan (12), USA (17), France (20), Germany (11), 
Belgium (2), Australia (5), Czech Republic (3), The Netherlands (2), China (27), Hungary (3), Italy (16), 
Spain (9), Argentina (1), Austria (3), Brazil (2), Switzerland (2), Russia (3), Singapore (1), South Korea 
(4), Taiwan (4), United Kingdom (5).

Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol was subsequently amended 5 times. 
Amendment 1 (dated 02 May 2013) essentially clarified inclusion/exclusion criteria, in particular inclusion 
of HCV positive patients not requiring antiviral treatment was allowed, whereas concomitant therapy with 
antivirals for HCV was not allowed.   
Amendment 2 (dated 13 December 2013) essentially changed the allowed time from last sorafenib 
treatment to randomization from 8 to 10 weeks, clarified exclusion of patients treated with non-occlusive 
arterial chemotherapies such as intra-arterial chemotherapy or lipiodolisation, and introduced the 
continuation of tumour evaluation for patients stopping treatment due to other reason than disease 
progression until progression was observed.  
Amendment 3 (dated 11 November 2014) increased the number of patients to be enrolled from 530 to 
560 in order to allow inclusion of 150 patients in China while at the same time adhering to the 40% cap 
for Asian patients (taking into account that 40 patients were required to be recruited in Japan and 32 
patients had already been recruited in other Asian Countries) and allowed inclusion of patients pre-
treated with intrahepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy with lipiodol.  
Amendment 4 (dated 02 November 2015) essentially removed the second interim analysis, as, due to the 
unexpectedly slow recruitment of patients in China, the second interim analysis would have been 
conducted before full subject accrual into the study had been reached. 
Amendment 5 (dated 1 December 2015) essentially added information regarding interaction of 
regorafenib with neomycin, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) UGT1A1, UGT1A9, P-glycoprotein 
substrates and bile salt-sequestering agents.

Patient-Reported Outcomes: FACT-Hep and EQ-5D 
FACT-Hep and EQ-5D questionnaires were administered at baseline and on Day 1 of all cycles and at the 
end of treatment visit. Higher scores of the FACT-Hep and EQ-5D represent a higher level of functioning 
and better HRQoL or fewer symptoms. The FACT-Hep score consists of the sum of the FACT-G (including 
5 subscales related to well-being) and the hepatobiliary cancer subscale (HCS, assessing specific 
symptoms of hepatobiliary carcinoma and side effects of its treatment). In the FACT-Hep minimally 
important difference (MID) for the trial outcome index (TOI) was 7-8 whereas for the FACT-G subscales: 
2-3, and for the FACT-G total score: 6-7. Changes of ≥7 points on the visual analogue scale (VAS) or ≥ 
0.10 to 0.12 points on the EQ-5D index were considered as clinically meaningful (MID: minimally 
important difference). 
Fact-Hep: During treatment questionnaire was completed by at least 80% of patients in both arms and in 
about 90% of patients in either treatment group were valid for analysis.

regorafenib in 36 patients with HCC and liver function status Child Pugh A that had experienced 
radiological disease progression during previous therapy with sorafenib. Primary endpoint was evaluation 
of safety. Secondary endpoints included TTP, ORR, DCR and OS. Patients received regorafenib 160 mg OS 
according to a 3 weeks on and 1 week off schema. Enrolment criteria were very similar to the ones of the 
pivotal RESORCE study. 
More than 80% of the subjects were male (88.9%), more than two-thirds were White (72.2%), 27.8% 
were Asians whereas none were Hispanic or Latino. Most patients were enrolled in Europe (77.8%), 
whereas the rest was enrolled in Korea (22.2%). Approximately two-thirds were ≤ 65 years of age 
(61.1%, median 61.0 years [range 40 to 76 years]) and both the mean (SD±3.9) and median BMI (range 
16.6 to 33.2 kg/m2) were < 25 kg/m2. 
Per protocol, all subjects had a medical history of HCC. In addition 24 of 36 (66.7%) subjects had a 
medical history of liver cirrhosis. Frequent and relevant medical history findings were: Hepatitis B Virus 
(HBV) in 18 subjects, 3 of whom had chronic HBV infections and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in 13 subjects, 3 
of whom had chronic HCV infections. 
All enrolled subjects (36 [100%]) received prior systemic anticancer therapy (sorafenib). The median 
duration of prior treatment with sorafenib was 137 days (range 15 to 993 days). 
Results: The ORR was 2.8% (95% CI 0.1- 14.5%, CR= 0, PR= 1). More than two-thirds of the subjects 
(25 [69.4%]) achieved stable disease. The DCR was 72.2% (n= 26 pts, 95% CI 54.8%- 85.8%). One-
third of the subjects (12 [33.3%]) showed a reduction in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions.  
Among the 36 subjects evaluated for OS, 8 (22.2%) were censored before or were alive at the cut-off 
date. Median OS was 419 days (13.8 months, range: 18 to 981 days). The OS rate at 90 days was 0.88 
(95% CI 0.72 - 0.95) and at 180 days was 0.79 (95% CI 0.61 - 0.89). The median KM estimate for TTP 
was 131 days (approximately 4.3 months).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The proposed regorafenib dose regimen is 160 mg OD administered according to a 3 weeks on/one week 
off schema, in line with the already approved indications in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and 
in GIST. No dose finding studies with regorafenib have been specifically conducted in patients with HCC, 
but the dose regimen is considered acceptable based on the provided data. Dose reductions in case of 
toxicity have been adequately described in the SmPC. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The evidence of efficacy of regorafenib in patients with HCC is based on the results of one pivotal study 
(15982 or RESORCE), supported by the data of the phase II single arm 14596 study, both enrolling 
patients with HCC and Child Pugh A as liver function previously treated with sorafenib. As in all studies 
performed to date with regorafenib in HCC, patients who had to discontinue sorafenib due to toxicity were 
excluded.  
Study 15982 (RESORCE) is a pivotal, phase III, multicentre, multinational, randomized, double blind, 
placebo-controlled study. A total of 573 patients with HCC and Child Pugh A as liver function score  
previously treated with sorafenib were randomized (2:1) to receive oral regorafenib 160 mg OD (3 weeks 
on/1 week off) plus BSC or matching placebo plus BSC. The two arms design of the study with placebo 
plus BSC as comparator is considered acceptable, as patients enrolled in the trial had received all the 
standard treatment options currently available in the EU.  
OS was the primary study endpoint which is considered appropriate for the proposed target population, 
considering the relatively short life expectancy and the absence of alternative treatment options to date. 
PFS, TTP and ORR were secondary endpoints, all assessed by the investigator according to mRECIST or 
RECIST 1.1 criteria. Evaluation of health related quality of life (according to FACT-Hep and EQ-5D 
questionnaires) was also performed which is agreed, in view of the palliative treatment setting and the 
known significant regorafenib-related toxicity. However, obvious differences in treatment induced 
toxicities between study regimens (regorafenib and placebo) might potentially have compromised the 
double-blind nature of this trial. A biomarker analysis was also planned as exploratory. However, 
collection of archival and fresh tumour biopsies as well as of plasma for biomarker evaluation was not 
mandatory in the study, and, as a result, no biomolecular data were available for the majority of patients. 
Considering that regorafenib is a TKI, the results of such analysis could have been employed to identify 
parameters for patient selection, even though results of biomarker analyses to date with regorafenib in 
advanced colorectal cancer and GIST have failed to identify analytes capable of reliably predict clinical 
outcome.  During the procedure, the MAH submitted the report on the analysis of non-genetic 
biomarkers.  Although the data suggest that the treatment benefit for regorafenib versus the placebo 
group is maintained for the vast majority of patients, no firm conclusions can be drawn from these 
exploratory analyses. Hence, the CHMP recommends the submission of retrospective exploratory genetic 
biomarker analyses to identify biomarker candidates which might help to predict response to regorafenib. 
The biomarker report is expected to be available for submission in Q3/2017. 
Of note, in the original study protocol two interim analyses were planned, one for early stop due to futility 
and a second one for efficacy. However, given the slow recruitment rate in China, it was expected that 
the second interim analysis would have been performed before accrual in the pivotal study was 
completed. As a consequence, the second interim analysis was removed by a protocol amendment. This is 
considered not to have impacted the results of the trial.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Demographic and baseline characteristics appeared comparable between the two study arms.  
The results of the final OS analysis based on 373 events (65%) (cut-off 29 Feb 2016) show a statistically 
significant improvement in OS for regorafenib compared with placebo (HR 0.627, 95% CI 0.50-0.785, 
p=0.00002), with a gain in median PFS of about 2.8 months in favour of regorafenib (median OS 10.6 vs 
7.8 months, respectively). The robustness of the OS effect is supported by several sensitivity analyses, 
the results of which are in line with the primary analysis (i.e. an unstratified analysis and an analysis 
using stratification information from the RAVE). The effect on OS was observed in most subgroups of the 
population. In particular no significant difference was observed by race and by geographical region.  
Regarding the secondary endpoints, consistency was observed in terms of PFS according to both 
mRECIST (HR 0.455, 95% CI 0.371-0.558, median PFS 1.5 and 3.1 months with regorafenib and 
placebo, respectively) and RECIST 1.1 (HR 0.427, 95% CI 0.348-0.524, median PFS 1.5 vs 3.4 months, 
respectively), as well as TTP (mRECIST: HR 0.442, 95% CI 0.358-0.545, median TTP 3.2 vs 1.5 months, 
respectively).  
The ORR observed in the regorafenib arm (mRECIST 10.6%) suggests no improvement of cancer related 
symptoms related to tumour shrinkage in the majority of patients. The observed improvement in OS and 
PFS appears to be essentially driven by patients experiencing disease stabilisation under treatment. The 
Quality of life analysis, showing no clinically meaningful difference between the two study arms; however, 
a trend for better scores in patients treated with placebo in particular at later cycles of treatment could be 
seen. 
Finally, consistent results in terms of median OS, TTP, ORR and DCR were reported in the supportive 
phase II single arm 14596 study compared with the pivotal phase III RESORCE study (median OS 13.8 
months, median TTP 4.3 months, ORR: 2.8%, DCR: 72.2%). Of note, enrolment criteria were quite 
similar in the two studies but in the 14596 trial the majority of patients (72%) were Whites. 
Evaluation of cancer related symptoms showed no significant difference between the two study arms. 
However, a numerical trend towards lower scores (and therefore worse quality of life and more 
symptoms) for patients treated with regorafenib is observed especially at later cycles. The reason for this 
difference observed between the two treatment arms favouring placebo at late treatment cycles is 
unclear. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A statistically significant improvement in OS with regorafenib plus BSC compared with placebo plus BSC 
has been observed in the pivotal RESORCE study in patients with HCC previously treated with sorafenib. 
The results appear mature and robust, and supported by the secondary study endpoints and by the 
results of the additional phase II 14596 study. The low ORR reported with regorafenib in both studies is 
disappointing, indicating that the treatment effect is essentially driven by patients experiencing disease 
stabilisation. This is also reflected by the results of the quality of life evaluation. The lack of compelling 
biomarker data (that can be foreseen in view of the very limited number of patients consenting for the 
optional biomarker analysis) is considered a deficiency of the submitted dossier. In effect, considering 
that regorafenib is presented as a targeted therapy (multikinase inhibitor) and that treatment with 
regorafenib is associated with substantial toxicity, evaluation of biomarkers could potentially help in 
addressing proper patient selection.  
The CHMP recommends the submission of retrospective explorative biomarker analyses to identify 
biomarker candidates which might help to predict response to regorafenib as follows:

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The main safety data for regorafenib treatment of subjects with HCC is derived from the pivotal Phase 3 
placebo-controlled study in 567 subjects (n=374 regorafenib) with HCC (Study 15982, RESORCE). The 
results of the phase 2 study in 36 subjects with HCC (Study 14596) are considered supportive and briefly 
reported. A phase 1 study including 23 subjects with HCC (Study 1165) is included in the overall pooled 
safety data. The phase 1 and phase 2 study have been previously submitted within the initial MAA for PK-
analysis. 
Additional supportive data for Stivarga is provided based on the overall safety database from 15 
completed (i.e. final or interim clean database available) company-sponsored monotherapy trials in 
subjects with cancer in any indication (n=4518) and briefly discussed as part of the supportive data. For 
adverse events of special interest, the results are compared to those observed in phase 3 placebo-
controlled studies in CRC (n=636 patients on regorafenib) and GIST (n=132 patients on regorafenib) for 
which the same dosing schedule was used. 
Patient exposure 
The overall median duration of treatment (including time interrupted) as of cut-off date of 29 FEB 2016 in 
the regorafenib group was 15.6 weeks compared to 8.4 weeks in the placebo group (Table 33). About one 
third (n=125, 33.4%) of patients had a treatment duration ≥ 6 months compared to 13.9% (n=24) on 
placebo. A total of 13.9% on regorafenib and 4.1% on placebo had a treatment duration ≥ 12 months. 
The median daily dose was 159.3 mg (range: 82.4-160), with approximately half of the subjects (49.2%) 
receiving 160 mg/day. Dose modifications were observed in 84.0% of subjects in the regorafenib group, 
and in 58.5% of subjects in the placebo group. At the data cut-off date treatment was ongoing in 65 
(17.2%) of subjects in the regorafenib group vs. 10 (5.2%) in the placebo group.

Adverse events 
Most patients in both treatment groups reported at least one TEAE (100% for regorafenib vs 92.7% for 
placebo) (Table 34). Drug-related TEAEs were reported at a higher frequency in the regorafenib group 
(92.5%) compared with the placebo group (51.8%). Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported at 
comparable rates (44.4% for regorafenib vs 46.6% for placebo), but confounded by the fact that subjects 
who were hospitalized within 30 days after their last dose of study medication intake due to progression 
of HCC were required to be included as treatment-emergent SAEs. Drug-related TESAEs were reported at 
a higher frequency in the regorafenib group (10.4% vs 2.6% for placebo). TEAEs of Grade ≥3 were

reported in 79.7% of the regorafenib treated compared with 58.5% in the placebo group. Deaths were 
reported in 13.4% in the regorafenib group vs 19.7% in the placebo group. The incidence of TEAEs 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was 24.9% in the regorafenib group versus 19.2% in the 
placebo group. TEAEs that led to dose modifications occurred more frequently during regorafenib 
treatment; 68.2% versus 31.1% in the placebo group.

CTCAE Version 4.03 used. 
a; This category includes all subjects who had at least one non-serious AE, irrespective of the occurrence of SAEs. 
b; Modifications included interruptions and reductions. 
Overall, AEs were most commonly reported within the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders (77.5%), 
general disorders and administration site conditions (69.5%), and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(64.0%). AEs with a higher incidence (≥10%) in the regorafenib group than the placebo group included 
HFSR (51.6% vs 7.3%), diarrhoea (41.2% vs. 15.0%), hypertension (30.7% vs. 6.2%), decreased 
appetite (30.7% vs. 14.0%), pyrexia (19.8% vs. 6.7%), and dysphonia (17.9% vs. 1.6%). 
The most commonly reported TEAEs (≥10%) in regorafenib treated subjects were in general in the same 
range as that reported previously for CRC and GIST. Adverse events like AST/ALT increased, bilirubin 
increased, oedema peripheral, ascites, hypoalbuminemia, abdominal pain upper and general health 
physical deterioration were reported at somewhat higher frequencies but this was also seen in the 
placebo group. Dysphonia was reported at lower rates in HCC compared to CRC and GIST.

the regorafenib group) and increases in AST levels (56 Grade 3 and 7 Grade 4 events; 57.9% (22/38) in 
the placebo group; 44.6% (41/92)  in the regorafenib group). HFSR was the most common TEAE and 
occurred at a notably higher frequency in the regorafenib group with 51.6% compared with 7.3% in the

the regorafenib arm were hypertension (14.7% regorafenib vs 4.7% placebo), HFSR (12.3% regorafenib 
vs 0.5% placebo), AST increased (9.9% regorafenib vs 9.8% placebo), hypophosphatemia (7.8% 
regorafenib vs 1.6% placebo), blood bilirubin increased (7.5% regorafenib vs 6.7% placebo) and fatigue

HFSR (50.8% regorafenib vs 5.7% placebo), diarrhea (33.4% regorafenib vs 9.3% placebo), decreased 
appetite (23.5% regorafenib vs 5.7% placebo), hypertension (23.0% regorafenib vs 4.7% placebo), 
fatigue (21.1% regorafenib vs 13.5% placebo), blood billirubine increased (15.8% regorafenib vs 2.6%

placebo), asthenia (11.2% regorafenib vs 5.7% placebo), and nausea (10.7% regorafenib vs 6.7% 
placebo). Most common drug-related TEAES in the placebo group were fatigue (13.5%), diarrhoea 
(9.3%), and AST increased (7.8%). 
Grade 3 drug-related TEAEs that occurred at a higher frequency (at least 4% of the subjects) in the 
regorafenib group during the study were hypertension (12.8%), HFSR (12.3%), blood bilirubin increased 
(5.1%), AST increased (4.5%), hypophosphatemia (4.3%), and lipase increased (4.0%). Drug-related 
CTCAE Grade 4 events occurred very infrequently in the regorafenib group and twice in the placebo group 
(1 event of AST increased and 1 event of renal failure). Grade 4 events that occurred in the regorafenib in 
at least two subjects were ALT increased (0.8%), AST increased (0.5%) and hypophosphatemia (0.5%). 
All other events occurred in a single subject.

were analysed by interval-specific and cumulative event rates. For most analysed common events, the 
highest event rate in the regorafenib group of Study 15982 (Pool 2) was in the first cycle. Time to first 
onset for the most frequent regorafenib ADRs (>25%) showed that the majority of regorafenib adverse

reactions - in particular HFSR (median 14 days, Q3: 24 days), hypertension (median: 15 days; Q3: 37 
days), fatigue (median 15 days; Q3: 42.5days) and decreased appetite (median 16 days; Q3:66.5 days) 
- occur within first weeks of treatment. Fatigue and decreased appetite occurred earlier in regorafenib-
treated subjects as compared to subjects in placebo arm (fatigue median 28 days, Q3: 54 days), 
decreased appetite median 29 days, Q3: 64 days). Diarrhoea (median: 26.5 days; Q3: 71 days) and 
infection (median 62 days; Q3: 128 days) events in subjects treated with regorafenib occur later during 
treatment and do not show a clear-cut difference in onset pattern as compared to placebo subjects. 
Outcome data for the most frequent regorafenib adverse reactions (>25% of regorafenib treatment 
group) have been reviewed for any potential data which would indicate that dose modifications or 
concomitant medications did not lead to an improvement of respective events. For decreased appetite, 
62.7% of events resolved (vs 36.4% placebo), for diarrhoea 82.7% of events resolved (vs 69.0% 
placebo), for fatigue 47.6% of events resolved (vs 34.9% placebo), for hypertension 61.0% events 
resolved (vs 66.7% placebo), for infections and infestations, 81.8% resolved (vs 76.7% placebo), and for 
HFSR 66.5% resolved (vs 45.5% placebo). 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
AEs  of  special  interest  include  cardiac  safety,  renal  safety,  hepatobiliary  events,  haemorrhage,  skin  AE, 
vascular  safety,  GI  safety,  wound  healing  and  infections.  The  important  identified  risks  of  regorafenib 
were  severe  drug-induced  liver  injury  (DILI),  cardiac  ischemic  events,  hypertension  and  hypertensive 
crisis,  haemorrhage,  HFSR,  posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES),  gastrointestinal 
perforation  and  fistulae,  Stevens-Johnson  Syndrome  (SJS)/Toxic  epidermal  necrolysis  (TEN).  Special 
attention has been given to hepatoxicity and haemorrhage in the HCC trial. 
Of note, the frequency of several AESIs (e.g., hepatobiliary disorders, proteinuria, pancreatitis, etc.) has 
been updated in the SmPC by the MAH, as the results of pooled analyses.  
Cardiac safety 
Cardiac ischemic events were reported at low rates but at a higher frequency in patients on regorafenib 
versus placebo (1.9% vs 0%). There does not appear to be an increased risk in patients with 
cardiovascular risk factors. Using the SMQ ischemic heart disease, events were reported in 2.4% (n=9) of 
patients on regorafenib versus 0.5% of patients on placebo (n=1). Five events in the regorafenib group 
were of grade 1-2, 2 of grade 3 and 1 each of grade 4 and 5. Corresponding rates for CRC were 1.6% 
regorafenib vs 0.3% placebo, and for GIST: 1.5% regorafenib vs 0% placebo. 
The incidence of cardiac arrhythmia (SMQ) events in general were low in patients subjects treated with 
regorafenib (n=14, 3.7% on regorafenib and n=4, 2.1% on placebo) and was mainly related to atrial 
fibrillation events (n=5, 1.3%). Atrial fibrillation is classified as an important potential risk for 
regorafenib. There were 3 cases of worst grade 1-2 severity, and two events of grade 3. Overall rates of 
atrial fibrillation were slightly higher than for placebo in all indications (HCC: 1.3% vs 0%; CRC: 1.4% vs 
0%; GIST: 0.8% vs 0%). The event was resolved in the majority of cases. Permanent study drug 
discontinuation did not become necessary.  
Events of congestive heart failure occurred at similar rates (16.8% on regorafenib and 14.5% on placebo) 
and events were more commonly in those patients with baseline risk factors.  
ECGs were not standard performed during follow-up. Previous data did not indicate clinically significant 
effect of regorafenib on QTc.

Renal safety 
Adverse events in the SOC of renal and urinary disorders were more commonly reported in the 
regorafenib group (16.8% vs 9.3% placebo). The most commonly reported event was proteinuria (8.6% 
for regorafenib vs 1.0% placebo) and mostly grade 1 to 2. The incidence of renal failure was higher for 
placebo than for regorafenib (4.1% vs 1.9%). There was no detrimental effects seen on estimated GFR or 
GFR using Risk Injury Failure criteria (RIFLE).   
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Regorafenib is known to increase transaminases and blood bilirubin levels and high frequencies were 
reported in HCC. ALT abnormalities were reported in 70.4% of regorafenib treated patients (vs 58.6% 
placebo). AST abnormalities occurred in 92.7% of regorafenib treated patients (vs 84.9% placebo). 
Billirubin abnormalities were reported in 78.2% and 54.2% in regorafenib and placebo-treated patients, 
respectively. AEs in the SOC of hepatobiliary disorders were reported in a similar percentage of subjects 
in both treatment groups (16.1% in the placebo group and 14.7% in the regorafenib group). In the 
regorafenib group, the most commonly reported AEs were hyperbilirubinemia (3.7%), hepatic failure 
(2.4%), and jaundice (2.1%). Hepatic failure was reported in 4.7% of subjects the placebo group and 
2.4% of subjects in the regorafenib group, and was the most commonly reported AE in the placebo 
group. There were two drug-related Grade-4 hepatobiliary disorders events in the regorafenib group 
(hyperbilirubinaemia and hepatic failure), and none in the placebo group. There were two drug-related 
Grade-5 hepatobiliary disorders event in the placebo group (both hepatic failure), and none in the 
regorafenib group. No cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) were reported.  
Compared to other indications CRC and GIST, laboratory abnormalities were reported at higher 
frequencies in both regorafenib and placebo am (ALT abnormalities: CRC: 47.4% regorafenib vs 30.1% 
placebo; GIST: both groups 40.9%; AST abnormalities: CRC: 66.2% regorafenib vs 23.8% placebo; 
GIST: 59.1% regorafenib vs 48.5% placebo; bilirubin abnormalities: CRC: 49.7% of regorafenib vs 
20.4% placebo; GIST: 34.4% regorafenib vs 12.1% placebo). Overall incidence rate of MEdDRA SMQ 
hepatic disorders (broad) was also higher for patients on regorafenib and highest in patients with HCC but 
also for the placebo group (55.1% vs 43.5%; CRC: 42.3% vs 25.6%; GIST: 24.2% vs 15.2%). SAEs in 
this SMQ were also higher for regorafenib in HCC compared to other indications and also placebo rates 
were higher (HCC:11.0% vs 15.0%; CRC: 6.3% vs 4.4%; GIST: 5.30% vs 1.5%). However, in HCC SAEs 
were reported at a higher incidence in the placebo group. Overall review of potential Hy’s Law cases and 
cases compatible with regorafenib-induced severe liver injury confirmed severe liver injury as a clinically 
serious (with potential fatal outcome) but uncommon adverse drug reaction for regorafenib. In that 
respect, for HCC subjects no new safety finding was observed. 
Skin and subcutaneous disorders 
Skin and subcutaneous AEs were common in subjects treated with regorafenib (65.5% vs 30.6% 
placebo). Most commonly reported events are hand and foot syndrome (51.6%), alopecia (7.0%), and 
rash (5.3%). There was one serious event of HFSR reported. HFSR events were reported as 
recovered/resolved in 100 of 191 regorafenib treated patients with such events, including the serious 
case. HFSR events led to dose reductions in 75 (20.1%) and to permanent study drug discontinuation in 
7 (1.9%) of regorafenib-treated patients. There were no fatal outcomes. 
The SMQ “severe cutaneous reactions (narrow) yielded 5 results in the regorafenib group (1.3%) versus 
none in the placebo group. Low rates were seen before (CRC: 2.5% vs 0.6%; GIST: 0% vs 0%). SJS and 
TEN have been previously determined as ADRs (frequency category: “rare”) for regorafenib. No SJS/TEN 
events with fatal outcome have been observed.

Vascular disorders and thromboembolic events 
Hypertension  is  common  among  subjects  treated  with  regorafenib  (30.7%  vs  6.2%  placebo).  The 
majority of hypertension occurred during the first cycle of treatment. Most events were of grade 2 or 3. 
One  SAE  of  hypertensive  crisis  was  reported  in  the  regorafenib  group,  there  were  no  fatal  outcomes. 
About 16.6% of events were reported as resolved, ten events (2.7%) led to a dose reduction, in one case 
the study drug needed to be discontinued.  
Frequencies  of  hypertension  were  also  high  in  CRC  (29.6%  vs  7.5%)  and  GIST  (60.6%  vs  25.8%).  In 
general, the incidence of hypertension is slightly higher in subjects with baseline history of hypertension, 
the same trend has been observed in placebo treated subjects. Overall, hypertension events in 3 patients 
in the placebo-controlled trials were considered serious, none were fatal.  
For  pulmonary  and  other  venous  embolism,  the  incidence  was  higher  in  the  placebo  group  than  in  the 
regorafenib  groups.  Regarding  arterial  thromboembolism,  the  incidence  was  higher  in  the  regorafenib 
group  than  in  the  placebo  groups  (2.9%  for  regorafenib  vs  0.5%  for  placebo)  in  HCC,  overall  higher 
incidences on regorafenib had been reported before. No new safety signals were identified based on the 
study in HCC compared to the known safety profile.  
Gastrointestinal disorders 
AEs  in  the  SOC  of  gastrointestinal  disorders  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  regorafenib  group 
(77.5%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (59.1%).  Diarrhoea  (41.2%  vs  15.0%  placebo)  and  abdominal  pain 
(21.1%  vs  15.5%)  were  the  most  common  gastrointestinal  disorders  in  the  regorafenib  group,  and  the 
majority  of  cases  were  mild  to  moderate  severity.  Stomatitis  was  reported  in  8.3%  of  subjects  in  the 
regorafenib group and 2.1% of subjects in the placebo group.  
Overall, 7 cases of pancreatitis (0.61%) have been reported within pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 
trials in regorafenib treated patients compared to one in placebo-treated patients using the MedDRA 
Labeling Group (MLG) pancreatitis (including the following MedDRA PTs: Pancreatitis, Pancreatitis acute, 
Oedematous pancreatitis, Pancreatitis relapsing). Thereof 6 cases, have been reported from pivotal study 
15982 (RESORCE) with 3 of them reported as serious. The remaining 2 cases (one case each for 
regorafenib and placebo arm) were reported from the pivotal CRC CORRECT study. In most cases the 
increase in laboratory values was accompanied by clinical symptoms. 
The majority of the pancreatitis events were grade 1 or 2 and no Grade 4 or 5 events were reported. No 
fatal events were reported. Pancreatitis has now been reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Gastrointestinal perforation by MEdDRA SMQ was reported infrequently across all indications (HCC: 1.3% 
vs 1.6%; CRC: 1.9% vs 0.6%; GIST: 3.0% vs 0%). SAEs on regorafenib, occurred in 0.8% HCC, 0.9% 
CRC  and  1.5%  GIST.  In  the  RESORCE  trial,  there  was  one  SAE  of  duodenal  perforation  (resulting  in 
death) in a regorafenib-treated subject, and there were no GI fistula SAEs. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
There was no indication of an increased risk of severe or significant respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
adverse  events  with  regorafenib  treatment.  The  incidence  of  AEs  was  higher  in  the  regorafenib  group 
than the placebo group (41.2% regorafenib vs 22.3% placebo), largely driven by the higher incidence of 
dysphonia  in  the  regorafenib  group  (17.9%  vs  1.6%).  Only  3  subjects  in  the  regorafenib  group  had 
reported worst Grade 4 events (haemoptysis, respiratory distress, and tracheal disorder).  
Interstitial lung disease had been identified as an important potential risk. There were 5 subjects (1.3%) 
with  events  included  in  the  SMQ  of  interstitial  lung  disease  in  the  regorafenib  group  (4  subjects  with 
pneumonitis and 1 subject with interstitial lung disease) and no subjects in the placebo group. No cases

of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease were drug-related. Corresponding incidences in CRC were 0.5% 
regorafenib vs 0.6% placebo and none within GIST. 
Metabolic and nutrition disorders  
Decreased  appetite  was  the  most  commonly  AE  reported  (30.7%  regorafenib  vs  14.0%  placebo),  the 
majority were non-serious.  
Haemorrhage 
The incidence of haemorrhagic events in the regorafenib group (17.6%) was similar to that in the placebo 
group (16.1%). The most common haemorrhagic events were epistaxis, haematuria, and haemoptysis, all 
reported at a higher incidence in the regorafenib group than in the placebo group. A total of 44/66 
patients on regorafenib with bleeding events recovered compared to 12/31 on placebo. 
SAEs occurred in 5.1% (n=19) of regorafenib treated group and 8.3% in the placebo group. In 10 of 
these 19 patients on regorafenib, the outcome was recovered/resolved and in 4 patients the events had a 
fatal outcome, compared to 7 fatal outcomes in the placebo group. Three patients discontinued the study 
drug and 4 patients had to reduce the dose due to a bleeding event. There was a higher incidence of 
upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (placebo 2.1%, regorafenib 1.1%) and gastrointestinal haemorrhage 
(placebo 2.1%, regorafenib 0.5%) in the placebo group compared to the regorafenib groups. There were 
3 cases of haemorrhagic shock in the regorafenib group of which 2 were grade 5 and one case of 
hypovolemic shock, grade 5. No events of shock occurred in the placebo group. Grade 5 haemorrhagic 
events were more common in the placebo group (3.6% vs 1.1% placebo). 
Most events were of grade 1 or 2. SAEs on regorafenib occurred at low frequencies but at somewhat 
higher rates in HCC (HCC: 5.1% vs 8.3%; CRC: 2.4% vs 0.6%, GIST: 3.8% vs 0%). Grade 5 events 
were low but again higher in HCC (HCC: 1.1% vs 3.6%; CRC: 0.6% vs 0%, GIST: 0%), however also for 
placebo. 
Infections 
The incidence of AEs in the SOC of infections and infestations was 31.3% for regorafenib versus 18.1% 
for placebo. Bronchitis (3.7%), nasopharyngitis (3.5%) and urinary tract infection (3.5%) were the most 
commonly reported AEs in the regorafenib group. Other infections reported were pneumonia (2.4% vs 
1.0%), upper respiratory infections (2.1% vs 1%), influenza (1.6% vs 0.5%), and sepsis (0.8% vs 0%). 
SAEs in the SOC of infections and infestations were also reported more frequently in the regorafenib 
group than in the placebo group (3.1%). Pneumonia was reported as SAE in 1.6% of subjects in the 
regorafenib group, and 0.5% of subjects in the placebo group. The respective Grade 5 incidence rate was 
1.3% (n=5) in the regorafenib group, compared with 0% in the placebo group. None of these were 
reported as drug-related by the treating physician; 2 cases were lung infection, 2 cases were sepsis-
related events, and 1 case was peritonitis.  
Infection related events were frequently reported across all indications and at comparable rates in the 
regorafenib group (CRC: 31.1% vs 19%; GIST: 34.8% vs 6.1%).

III trials 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
Using the MedDRA search strategy pertaining to PRES, excluding headache, 7 patients were identified in 
the regorafenib group (1.9%) compared to 7 patients in the placebo group (3.6%). Most of these were of 
grade 3 in the regorafenib group. Headache was reported as similar percentages in both treatment arms 
(about 6 Comparable frequencies for the PRES search strategy were seen in CRC (1.6% vs 2.8%) and 
GIST (0.8% vs 3.0%). No confirmed case with PT PRES has been reported in HCC. Overall, the PT PRES 
has been reported once in the placebo-controlled trials in a patient with GIST.  
Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) 
There were no cases of interest regarding the identified potential risk thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) 
in the study. Overall, one case was reported in CRC based on the placebo-controlled studies.  
Wound healing complications 
Using Product-specific Bayer MedDRA query (PBMQ), there were 5 (1.3%) cases in the regorafenib group 
vs none in the placebo group.  No serious cases were reported, and the majority has been reported as 
recovered. Corresponding rates for CRC were 0.16% vs 0.62% and for GIST: 1.5% vs 1.3%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Overall, 256 (45.1%) subjects in the SAF were reported to have had SAEs. There were 10.4% (n=39) of 
drug-related SAEs in the regorafenib group compared with 2.6% (n=5) in the placebo group. SAEs are 
shown in the table below (Table 39).

Most of these drug-related SAEs were CTCAE Grade 3 in both treatment groups (n=21, 5.6% regorafenib 
and n=3, 1.6% placebo). Most Grade 3 events were related to the following SOCs: General disorders and 
administration site conditions (6 events), Gastrointestinal disorders (5 events), and Infections and 
infestations (3 events). 
Serious adverse events leading to hospitalization 
Overall, 40.6% in the regorafenib group and 38.3% of the SAEs resulted in hospitalization. Most 
frequently reported SAEs leading to hospitalisation on regorafenib and with a difference of 1% compared 
to placebo were general physical health deterioration (7.8% regorafenib vs 5.7% placebo), and 
pneumonia (1.6% regorafenib vs 0.5% placebo). The incidence of the SAEs of pneumonia, pyrexia, and 
Assessment report

dyspnoea leading to hospitalisation was higher in the regorafenib group, while the incidence of the SAEs 
of hepatic function abnormal, decreased appetite, and respiratory failure was higher in the placebo group. 
The majority of events leading to hospitalisation in regorafenib-treated subjects are comparable with 
respect to frequencies and affected organ sites to respective events reported for subjects treated within 
placebo arm. There was a slight increase (~3%) in reported Grade 3 events leading to hospitalisation in 
regorafenib arm. This difference is mainly due to an increase of reported SOC infection Grade 3 events 
(n=19; 5.1%) leading to hospitalisation.  
Death 
An overview of all deaths during treatment and up to 30 days post permanent treatment discontinuation 
is shown below (Table 40).

A treatment group comparison of the incidence of CTCAE Grade 5 TEAEs (deaths) for the SAF is 
presented in Table 41. Altogether, 88 subjects died due to Grade 5 TEAEs during the study, 38 (19.7%) 
in the placebo group and 50 (13.4%) in the regorafenib group. Incidence rates were in general 
comparable or slightly lower in the regorafenib group. A higher frequency of deaths was reported for 
regorafenib in the SOC Infections and infestations (1.3% vs 0 placebo) and vascular disorders (0.8% vs 
0% placebo).

In total, at the time of the database cut-off, there were 9 TEAEs with a fatal outcome (Grade 5) within 30 
days of last study drug that were reported as treatment-related in the clinical database. Two subjects’ 
deaths were considered study drug-related in the placebo group (acute hepatic failure) compared with 7 
subjects’ deaths in the regorafenib group. Within the regorafenib group the cause of death was duodenal 
perforation, meningorrhagia, hemorrhagic shock, hepatic encephalopathy, myocardial infarction, general 
physical health deterioration, or death.  All were single cases.

in either treatment group. 
ECOG performance status 
There were no marked treatment differences with respect to the proportion of subjects with ECOG 
performance status at any given visit up to Cycle 18 during the course of the study. Altogether 60% of 
the placebo subjects and 69% of regorafenib subjects maintained ECOG performance status 0 up to Cycle 
18 of the study. At end of treatment visit, 41% of the placebo subjects and 30% of the regorafenib 
subjects maintained performance status of 0.  
Child-Pugh assessment 
The proportion of subjects with Child-Pugh classification A ranged from 98.7% at Baseline to 55.7% at 
End of Treatment in the regorafenib group and from 97.4% to 62.2% of the subjects in the placebo 
group. The proportion of subjects with Child-Pugh classification B ranged from 1.1% at Baseline to 31.6% 
at End of Treatment in the regorafenib group and 2.6% to 27.6% in the placebo group.

Safety in special populations 
Age 
Specific categories of adverse events were analysed by age subgroup and results are provided in Table 
43.  Within the regorafenib group, serious ADRs were reported more frequently in subjects 75 years of 
age and older (54.7%) than in in subjects 65 to 74 years of age (35.5%) and below 65 years (47.7). In 
contrast, frequencies within the placebo group were comparable for subjects ≥75 years and between 65-
74 years (about 37%-38%). Within the regorafenib group, especially AEs in the SOC vascular disorders 
were reported more frequently in subjects 75 years of age and older (52.8%) than in in subjects 65 to 74 
years of age (39.5%) and below 65 years (29.2%). The same trend was seen in the placebo group. Also 
AEs in the SOC infections and infestations were reported more frequently in patients of 75 years and 
older compared to patients 65-74 years (37.7% vs 29.0%), and notably more often in the regorafenib 
group ≥75 years compared to placebo ≥75 years (37.7% vs 9.5%). For common AEs (>10% overall in 
regorafenib group) and in subjects 65 years and older, diarrhoea, fatigue, and peripheral oedema were 
seen more frequently in the regorafenib group in subjects 75 years of age and older than in subjects 65 
to 74 years of age. Hypoalbuminemia and anaemia were also seen more frequently in subjects 75 years 
of age and older than in subjects 65 to 74 years of age. Overall incidences of worst Grade 3, 4, or 5 AEs 
in placebo subjects were 62.6% and 52.6%, respectively, for subjects <65 and ≥65 years of age.

reaction. 
Across  all  clinical  trials,  cardiac  disorder  events  (all  grades)  have  been  more  often  (13.7%  vs.  6.5%) 
reported  in  Stivarga-treated  patients  aged  75  years  or  older  (N=410),  compared  to  Stivarga-treated 
patients below 75 years (N=4108). 
Gender 
Since HCC is a male dominant disease, 88% of the subjects were male, and a much smaller number of 
female subjects were analysed. A few large (≥10%) differences in incidence rates between male and 
female subjects were observed. Of AEs that were most common (>10% overall), the most commonly 
reported AEs with a higher frequency in the regorafenib group in female subjects than male subjects by 
10 or more percent were HFSR, pyrexia, nausea, constipation, anaemia, and vomiting. Except for 
constipation, there was a higher frequency of these AEs also in females in the placebo group, but not by 
10 or more percent.  
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017

Overall incidences of worst Grade ≥3 in placebo subjects were 60.6% and 43.5%, respectively, for male 
and female subjects; and 78.0% and 91.3%, respectively in the regorafenib group. Grade 5 AEs were 
reported in the placebo group in 21.2% of males and 8.7% of females; and in the regorafenib group, in 
11.9% of males and 23.9% of females. No deaths in females were assessed by the investigator as drug-
related, and most deaths in females were due to general physical health deterioration. Drug-related 
deaths were reported in 7 males in the regorafenib group, and 2 males in the placebo group.  
The popPK covariate analysis across 16 studies confirmed no relevant influence of sex on the PK of 
regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 which is in line with previous findings. 
Race 
In the regorafenib treated patients, there was a higher incidence in Asians of HFSR; 67.1% and 42.2%, 
respectively, for Asian and White subjects. The overall incidence of hand-foot skin reaction (74.8%, CRC, 
88.2%,  GIST  and  67.1%,  HCC)  was  higher  in  Stivarga-treated  Asian  patients,  compared  to  other 
ethnicities. The incidence of Grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction in Asians was 20.5% (CRC), 23.5% (GIST) 
and  13.5%  (HCC).The  incidence  of  Grade  3  hand-foot  skin  reaction  in  Asians  was  20.5%  (CRC),  23.5% 
(GIST) and 13.5% (HCC). This is currently reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. Other AEs 
reported more frequently in Asian subjects (>10% difference) included ALT increased (20.6% vs 8.1%), 
AST  increased  (36.8%  vs  13.3%),  and  hypoalbuminaemia  (23.2%  vs  5.9%).  AEs  reported  more 
frequently in White subjects included fatigue (37.8% vs 16.8%) and hypothyroidism (13.3% vs 3.2%). 
Increased  incidence  of  HFSR  and  ALT/AST  increases  is  in  line  with  previous  observations.  The  popPK 
covariate analysis across 16 studies indicated no relevant influence of race on the PK of regorafenib, M-2 
and M-5. 
Hepatic impairment 
Regorafenib is eliminated mainly via the hepatic route. A total of 124/374 subjects in the regorafenib 
group and 54/193 in the placebo group had mildly impaired hepatic function at baseline (baseline AST 
and ALT 1.5 x ULN to 3 x ULN) and 35/374 in the regorafenib group and 16/193 in the placebo group had 
mildly impaired hepatic function (baseline AST and ALT > 3 x ULN). Overall, there were no notable 
differences in the incidence of AEs within the different hepatic function categories in the regorafenib 
treatment group, except for ALT increased, AST increased, hypoalbuminemia, and ascites, all of which 
had an approximately twofold higher incidence in the ‘baseline AST and ALT 1.5 x ULN to 3 x ULN’ than in 
the category ‘baseline AST and ALT ≤1.5 x ULN’. Except for hypoalbuminemia, this trend was also seen in 
placebo subjects. 
The proportion of subjects with Child-Pugh classification A ranged from 98.7% at baseline to 55.7% at 
end of treatment in the regorafenib group and from 97.4% to 62.2% of the subjects in the placebo group. 
The proportion of subjects with Child-Pugh classification B ranged from 1.1% at baseline to 31.6% at end 
of treatment in the regorafenib group and 2.6% to 27.6% in the placebo group. 
No clinically important differences in exposure were observed between subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) 
or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. 
However, the dataset in moderate hepatic impairment is too limited to provide dose recommendations. 
No dose adjustment is required in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. Regorafenib has not been 
studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).

Renal impairment 
Over 94% of the subjects had normal kidney function at baseline, thus making it difficult to draw 
meaningful conclusions about comparison of adverse event rates by renal function in this study.  
Available clinical data indicate similar exposure of regorafenib and its metabolites M-2 and M-5 in subjects 
with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. There 
are no safety signals identified based on the recently completed study (Study 16653) in patients with 
severe renal impairment (n=6 regorafenib). No dose adjustment is therefore required in patients with 
mild, moderate or severe renal impairment.  
Body mass index/body weight 
The overall incidence of any AE and the incidence of most of the common AEs, including hypertension, 
HFSR, diarrhoea, and fatigue was similar among BMI subgroups (BMI <20, 20 – 25, 25 -30, ≥ 30 kg/m2). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new clinically relevant drug-drug interaction signals have been identified by the data submitted for the 
present Type II variation.  
Supportive data  
Phase 2 study 14596 
Within the phase 2 study, thirty-six patients were treated with intermittent dosing (3 weeks on/1 week 
off treatment) of regorafenib (160 mg p.o.). The median (mean) overall time under treatment (including 
interruptions) was 19.5 weeks (34.7 weeks) (range 2 - 127 weeks). The safety profile was in general 
consistent with that seen in the pivotal trial and did not give rise to new safety signals. 
Pooled safety data 
Additional supportive data for Stivarga is provided based on the overall safety database from 15 
completed (i.e. final or interim clean database available) company-sponsored monotherapy trials in 
subjects with cancer in any indication (Pool 1). In total, 4518 regorafenib-treated subjects are included in 
this pool (phase 1 to phase 3). Of note, 2864 (63.4%) of the subjects in Pool 1 were from one study 
(Study 15967, CONSIGN) in subjects with metastatic CRC. It also includes data with a different dosing 
schedule and data of subjects, who after unblinding, crossed over from placebo to regorafenib treatment. 
Pool 2 consists of safety data from HCC (Study 15982, RESORCE). Pool 3 consists of safety data 
(regorafenib vs placebo) from 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies for the 
indications CRC (n=636), GIST (n=132), and HCC (n=374). In total, 1142 regorafenib-treated subjects 
and 580 placebo subjects are included in this pool. Only the blinded treatment phase data are included. 
Median time of exposure for regorafenib (including time off drug/interruptions) was 25.4 weeks (range 
0.1-95) in pool 2, 18.8 weeks (range 0-193) in pool 1 and 19 weeks (range 0-128) in pool 3. Median 
dose was 160 mg and ranged from 80-160 mg in pool 2 and pool 3 and from 10-220 mg in pool 1. 
Patients included in the safety population were mostly male (61.7% pool 1 and 70.4% pool 3 compared 
to 87.7% pool 2). Median age was around 61, range 18-89. About 60% was below 65 years of age (pool 
1 and pool 3). Median BMI was about 25 kg/m2 and ranged from 13.6 – 55.1 kg/m2. With regard to race, 
the overall patient population treated (Pool 1) was White (75%) followed by Asian (12%). Within Pool 3, 
54% of patients were White and 35% Asian. 
The most common TEAEs reported in the different safety pools are presented in the table below.

Table 17: Most common (>10% overall in any regorafenib treatment group) treatment-emergent adverse 
events by MedDRA PT (SAF) 
In the placebo-controlled phase III trials (pool 3), the overall incidence of haemorrhage was 18.2% in 
patients treated with regorafenib and 9.5% in patients receiving placebo. Most cases of bleeding events in 
patients treated with regorafenib were mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 and 2: 15.2%), most 
notably epistaxis (6.1%). Fatal outcome in patients treated with regorafenib was uncommon (0.7%), and 
included cerebral, respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary events (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
In the placebo-controlled phase III trials (pool 3), infections were more often observed in patients treated 
with regorafenib, compared to patients receiving placebo (all grades: 31.6% vs. 17.2%). Most infections 
in patients treated with regorafenib were mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 and 2: 23.0%), and 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017

included urinary tract infections (5.7%), nasopharyngitis (4.0%), mucocutaneous and systemic fungal 
infections (3.3%) as well as pneumonia (2.6%).  Fatal outcomes associated with infection were observed 
more often in patients treated with regorafenib (1.0%), compared to patients receiving placebo (0.3%), 
and were mainly respiratory events(see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
In the placebo-controlled phase III trials (pool 3), the overall incidence of hand-foot skin reaction was 
higher in patients treated with regorafenib, compared to patients receiving placebo (all grades: 51.4% vs. 
6.5% CRC, 66.7% vs. 15.2% GIST and 51.6% vs.7.3% HCC). Most cases of hand-foot skin reaction in 
patients treated with regorafenib appeared during the first cycle of treatment and were mild to moderate 
in severity (Grades 1 and 2: 34.3%%, CRC, 44.7%, GIST and 39.3%, HCC). The incidence of Grade 3 
hand-foot skin reaction was 17.1% (CRC), 22.0% (GIST) and 12.3% (HCC).  
In the placebo-controlled phase III trials (pool 3), the overall incidence of hypertension was higher in 
patients treated with regorafenib, compared to patients receiving placebo (29.6% vs. 7.5% CRC, 60.6% 
vs. 25.8% GIST and 31.0% vs. 6.2% HCC). Most cases of hypertension in patients treated with 
regorafenib appeared during the first cycle of treatment and were mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 
and 2: 20.9%, CRC, 31.1%, GIST and 15.8% HCC). The incidence of Grade 3 hypertension was 8.7% 
(CRC), 27.3% (GIST) and 15.2% (HCC). One case of Grade 4 hypertension was reported in the GIST 
trial. 
In the placebo-controlled phase III trials (pool 3), the overall incidence of treatment emergent proteinuria 
was 9.1% in patients treated with regorafenib, compared to 1.9% in patients receiving placebo. Of these 
events, 35.6% in the regorafenib arm and 54.5% in the placebo arm have been reported as not 
recovered/not resolved. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The table of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the new clinical data available. 
The denominator (4,800) used for the calculation of frequencies includes all cancer patients treated with 
regorafenib either in monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer drugs (i.e. FOLFOX, FOLFIRI) 
studied in completed and ongoing company-sponsored clinical trials as of July 2016. 
Frequencies of all 47 ADRs previously determined based on pooled data from placebo-controlled phase III 
trials 14387-CORRECT and 14874-GRID were reassessed based on updated pooled data also including 
placebo-controlled studies 15808-CONCUR and 15982-RESORCE. Few changes have been reflected for 
increases in transaminases (shift from “common” to “very common” category), alopecia and headache 
(shift from “very common” to “common” category). Pancreatitis was the only new ADR included in the 
frequency category “uncommon”. The ADR “Musculoskeletal stiffness” has been reworded to “Muscle 
spasms” in section 4.8 of the SmPC as it reflects the majority of PTs reported.

There were no changes in the frequencies of 8 SAEs (gastrointestinal perforation, hypersensitivity 
reaction, severe liver injury, hypertensive crisis, keratoacanthoma/squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, 
PRES, SJS, and TEN).  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There was a higher frequency of withdrawals of study medication due to TEAEs in the regorafenib group 
with 24.9% (n=93) of subjects compared with 19.2% (n=37) of subjects in the placebo group. The 
majority of these TEAEs were CTCAE grades 3 (15.0% regorafenib vs 13.0% placebo) or 4 (4.8% 
regorafenib vs 4.7% placebo). TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug ≥1% of subjects in the 
regorafenib group were general physical health deterioration (3.7%), AST increased (2.4%) and blood 
bilirubin increased (2.1%), HFSR (1.9%), hepatic failure (1.6%) and asthenia (1.1%). TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug in the placebo group were blood bilirubin increased (3.6%), general physical 
health deterioration (2.1%), ascites (2.1%), fatigue, hepatic failure, hepatic function abnormal and AST 
increased (each 1.6%), and asthenia and hepatic haemorrhage (each 1.0%). 
The incidence of drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 10.4% in the regorafenib 
group and 3.6% in the placebo group. In the regorafenib group, the most common AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug were HFSR (1.9%) and AST increased (2.4%). All other drug-related AEs 
leading to discontinuation were reported in <1% of subjects in the placebo group or regorafenib group. 
Overall, the incidence of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were higher than 
previously reported in the combined placebo-controlled trials for CRC and GIST (15.2% regorafenib vs 
11.6% placebo (EMEA/H/C/002573/II/0001).  
Dose interruptions due to TEAEs 
There was a higher frequency of interruptions of study medication due to TEAEs in the regorafenib group 
with 58.3% of subjects compared with 29.0% of subjects in the placebo group. The majority of these 
TEAEs were CTCAE Grade 3 (41.2% regorafenib vs 19.7% placebo). Grade 4 TEAEs were reported in 
5.1% of patients on regorafenib and 3.1% on placebo. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to dose 
interruptions in at least 4% of subjects in the regorafenib treatment group included HFSR (11.2%), blood 
bilirubin increased (5.9%), AST increased (5.1%), fatigue (4.5%), and diarrhoea (4.0%). 
Dose reductions due to TEAEs 
Overall the frequency of dose reductions due to TEAEs was notably higher in the regorafenib group at 
47.9% compared with 7.8% in the placebo group. The majority of the TEAEs were CTCAE Grade 2 or 3. 
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to dose reductions in at least 4% of subjects in the regorafenib 
treatment group included HFSR (20.1%), and diarrhoea (4.3%). The majority of TEAEs was of Grade 2 
(n=78, 20.9%) and Grade 3 (n=62, 16.6%) severity. 
Overall, dose modifications due to AEs were frequently reported in the RESORCE trial (68.2% vs 31.1% 
placebo), and in line with that reported previously for CRC and GIST (67.2% vs 21.3%). 
Post marketing experience 
The first approval for regorafenib (Stivarga) was granted in the USA on 27 SEP 2012. As of 31 May 2016 
and based on current sales data, at present around 90% of the commercial regorafenib tablets are used 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017 
Page 76/91 
 
  
  
to treat CRC patients and around 10% to treat GIST patients. It is estimated that up to 31 May 2016 
around 79,026 patients have been exposed to regorafenib in post marketing setting. 
The SAEs reported so far in the post-marketing setting (as of 01 JUL 2016) are consistent with the known 
safety profile of regorafenib outlined in current product information. To date, no new safety signal for 
regorafenib has been observed based on the received post-marketing reports. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data for regorafenib in HCC is primarily derived from one placebo-controlled phase 3 study 
including 374 patients treated with a regorafenib starting dose of 160 mg once daily for three weeks 
followed by one week off treatment. The median dose was 159.3 mg (82.4-160) with approximately half 
of the patients (49.2%) receiving 160 mg/day. The median duration of treatment (including time 
interrupted) was 15.6 weeks (range 0.1-128 weeks), 13.9% of patients had a treatment duration ≥12 
months. Therefore, limited long-term safety data is available in HCC. However, long-term safety data for 
regorafenib is available from other indications and post-marketing and this does not indicate delayed 
toxicity. Further, the patient population with HCC has a reduced life expectancy. Therefore it is sufficient 
to follow-up long-term safety in HCC through regular pharmacovigilance activities. 
Patients included in the study had progressed on sorafenib therapy, whereas subjects were excluded in 
case of permanent discontinuation of sorafenib therapy due to sorafenib-related toxicity. The safety in 
patients with HCC not tolerating sorafenib is therefore unknown. As sorafenib belongs to the same 
pharmacological class, there is a risk of underreporting of certain adverse events and especially serious 
adverse events in HCC. As a consequence, a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
reflect that the tolerability of regorafenib has not been established in patients who discontinued sorafenib 
therapy due to sorafenib-related toxicity or only tolerated a low dose (< 400 mg daily) of sorafenib. 
It should be noted that patients included in the study were relatively healthy with mostly ECOG PS=0 
(about 66%), well preserved liver function (Child Pugh: 98%) and lack of significant comorbidities like 
cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension and presence of untreated large oesophageal varices. Hence, 
the MAH will conduct a non-interventional PASS in order to provide additional information on safety in a 
less healthy population excluded from the pivotal study (see RMP). 
Adverse events 
AEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and 
administration site disorders and skin and subcutaneous disorders. Most frequently reported adverse 
events were HFSR (51.6% vs 7.3% placebo), diarrhoea (41.2% vs 15.0% placebo), decreased appetite 
(30.7% vs 14.0% placebo), hypertension (30.7% vs 6.2% placebo) and fatigue (28.6% vs 24.4% 
placebo). Grade 3/4 events were reported at a higher frequency for regorafenib than for placebo (66.3% 
vs 38.9%). The most common grade 3 AEs in the regorafenib arm were hypertension (14.7% regorafenib 
vs 4.7% placebo) and HFSR (12.3% regorafenib vs 0.5% placebo). The most common (≥ 1%) Grade-4 
events in the regorafenib group included lipase increased (regorafenib group 1.9% vs placebo group 
0.0%) and AST increased (regorafenib group 1.1% vs placebo group 1.6%). 
HFSR, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, hypertension, and fatigue were also the most commonly reported 
drug-related AEs occurring ≥20% of patients. Grade 3/4 drug-related events were reported at a higher 
frequency for regorafenib than for placebo. The most common grade 3 AEs in the regorafenib arm were 
hypertension (12.8% regorafenib vs 3.1% placebo) and HFSR (12.3% regorafenib vs 0.5% placebo).  
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017 
Page 77/91 
 
  
  
HSFR, hypertension, decreased appetite and fatigue most frequently occurred within the first weeks of 
treatment, whereas diarrhoea occurred later during treatment. Most cases were of grade 1-2 severity and 
most events resolved by dose modifications and application of standard of care treatment. 
The overall safety profile resembles that known for regorafenib and for drugs affecting VEGFR and other 
tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways in general. Pancreatitis was the only new ADR identified reported in 
1.6% of regorafenib treated patients in HCC (0% placebo), the majority of events being of mild to 
moderate severity whereas only one SAE (grade 1) was considered drug-related. Pancreatitis has now 
been added to section 4.8 (frequency “uncommon”) of the SmPC. No fatal events were reported and no 
additional warnings are required. 
AEs were in general comparable within the subgroups analysed. HFSR and increases in transaminases 
had a higher incidence in Asians, which has been observed before. Although some AEs occurred more 
frequently in female, the overall female population was limited since HCC is a male dominant disease and 
no firm conclusions can be drawn. At the moment, there are no clear signals for gender differences based 
on the known PK profile of regorafenib and previous studies performed. Further, cardiovascular events 
and AEs in the SOC infections and infestations appear higher in patients of 75 years and older, but 
number of patients are limited (n=53 for regorafenib and n=21 placebo). No clear signals for differential 
exposure were identified based on pharmacokinetics over the studied range of 29 to 85 years. In 
addition, in the popPK covariate analysis across 16 studies which included evaluation within different age 
categories, age had no relevant influence on the PK of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 which is in line with 
previous findings. No dose adjustment is therefore considered necessary in elderly patients.  
Serious adverse events/Death/Other significant effects 
Similar frequencies of occurrence of SAEs were observed in both treatment groups with 46.6% in the 
placebo group and 44.4% in the regorafenib group. Drug-related SAEs were reported at higher 
frequencies for regorafenib (10.4% vs 2.6%). The most commonly reported SAEs in the regorafenib arm 
were general physical health deterioration, ascites and hepatic failure which were reported at comparable 
or higher frequencies in the placebo-group. These mostly likely reflect the underlying malignancy. 
Deaths occurred more often in the placebo arm (19.7% vs 13.4% regorafenib), mainly due to clinical 
progression of disease. Seven cases were reported as treatment-related, fatal adverse events occurred in 
a single subject and no pattern was seen.  
A higher incidence of grade 5 infections with fatal outcome was reported for regorafenib in HCC (1.3% vs 
0%) and infection has been added newly as an important identified risk. This is agreed upon based on the 
overall increased risk in placebo-controlled trials (1% regorafenib vs 0.3% placebo). Most fatal infections 
concerned respiratory infections and none was reported as drug-related. Infections are a known 
commonly occurring ADR and concern those typically seen in cancer subjects (e.g. respiratory, urinary 
tract, and sepsis). The pathomechanism of regorafenib-related infection is unknown, and different 
potential mechanisms are discussed by the MAH in the RMP. These include blockade of haematopoietic 
stem-cell cycling, differentiation and haematopoietic recovery after bone-marrow suppression, or 
modulation of immune cells (T cells) that are present in the tumour microenvironment and consequent 
host response to infections. The review of the 7 cases of fatal infectious events in the RESORCE trial and 
literature data on treatment of cancer patients with VEGFR-TKIs in general, did not reveal any potential 
risk factors for (fatal) infectious events. The apparent higher number of fatal infectious events in patients 
with HCC on regorafenib compared to GIST and CRC could be a chance finding. 
In cases of worsening infection events, interruption of regorafenib treatment should be considered. 
Follow-up through routine risk minimisation measures and risk mitigation by a warning in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC is considered sufficient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017

There were no other new safety signals based on the HCC study taking into account the identified 
important and potential risks. Special attention had been given to hepatoxicity and haemorrhage in the 
HCC trial given the known toxicity of regorafenib. Laboratory abnormalities of ALT, AST, and bilirubin and 
hepatic failure/injury events were higher than for other indications, however, this was also seen in the 
placebo group. SAEs were reported at higher frequencies in placebo than for regorafenib and hepatic 
failure events of grade 3 and more were more frequently reported in the placebo group (4.7% vs 2.4% 
regorafenib). Currently, the data do not indicate differences in susceptibility towards regorafenib-induced 
severe liver injury between distinct underlying tumour types. However, it may be difficult to detangle 
drug-related from disease-related events in HCC. Most patients had mildly impaired hepatic function. 
Within the group of patients with moderate hepatic impairment, ALT/AST increased, hypoalbuminemia, 
and ascites, had an approximately twofold higher incidence which, except for hypoalbuminemia, was also 
seen in placebo subjects. Close monitoring of safety is already recommended for patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment including dose modification recommendations, and use in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment is not recommended. These risk management measures are also considered adequate for 
patients with HCC. 
Overall incidence of haemorrhagic events was comparable between treatment groups, and in line with 
that reported for other indications for regorafenib (CRC: 19.3% vs 6.9%; GIST: 14.4% vs 3.0%). SAEs 
occurred at low frequencies but was somewhat higher for both regorafenib and especially placebo in HCC 
(5.1% vs 8.3%) than for CRC (2.4% vs 0.6%) and GIST (3.8% vs 0%). Patients with HCC may be at an 
increased risk of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhages and especially oesophageal varices bleeding due to 
portal hypertension. Only patients screened for oesophageal varices and treated were included in the 
study, which may reduce the risk of bleedings. A precautionary statement has been included in section 
4.4 of the SmPC to recommend that screening for and subsequent treatment of large oesophageal varices 
in patients with liver cirrhosis should be performed as per standard of care before starting treatment with 
regorafenib. 
Overall, the laboratory toxicity profile in the RESORCE trial was as expected for this class of drug and was 
consistent with that previously observed during the regorafenib clinical development program. However, 
as expected in HCC subjects owing to the underlying liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis, hepatitis) elevations in 
AST, ALT, and bilirubin were more frequently recorded in the RESORCE trial than previously seen in the 
CRC and GIST subjects. There were no new signals based on laboratory parameters. 
Discontinuations/dose modifications 
No dose finding was performed for HCC and the dose was similar to that of CRC and GIST. Dose reduction 
and/or temporary interruption of regorafenib is already recommended within the SmPC in case of specific 
adverse events/laboratory abnormalities, the minimal recommended dose is 80 mg. Dose modifications 
due to AEs were frequently reported for regorafenib (68.2%), it remains uncertain whether a lower 
starting dose could reduce the frequency of AEs at comparable efficacy. Nevertheless, comparable high 
dose modification rates were reported previously for CRC and GIST. In most cases, treatment could be 
continued; permanent discontinuation was reported in 24.9% regorafenib vs 19.2% placebo. The 
difference in drug discontinuation appears related to AEs not associated with clinical disease progression 
(12.4% vs 6.2%) whereas discontinuation due to progressive disease was comparable among treatment 
groups (14%-15%). The latter may be explained by the fact that regorafenib rather stabilises disease and 
patients on regorafenib had longer follow-up. Most common AEs leading to permanent discontinuation 
were general physical health deterioration (3.7%), AST increased (2.4%) and blood bilirubin increased 
(2.1%). There was no increase in specific adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation. The 
overall discontinuation rate may be considered acceptable taking into account the observed benefit in the 
patient population with severe disease and limited treatment options.

Pooled data 
The applicant compared the safety data as reported for HCC to pool 1 (regorafenib monotherapy) and 
pool 3 (placebo-controlled studies) data. In general, the safety profile was comparable between all pools. 
Consistent with the underlying disease in HCC subjects, the incidences of ascites, peripheral oedema, and 
hypoalbuminemia were higher (with a difference of at least 5%) in the regorafenib treated subjects pool 2 
than for those in pool 1 and pool 3. For ascites and peripheral oedema, the incidences in the placebo 
group in pool 2 were considered similar to those in the regorafenib treatment group (about 14%-16%); 
for hypoalbuminemia, the incidence in the placebo group of pool 2 was lower than for regorafenib (7.3% 
vs 13.9%) but higher than that in the placebo group of pool 3 (4.0%). The incidences of AST increased, 
ALT increased and bilirubin increased were also higher in both treatment groups in pool 2 than in pools 1 
and 3. On the other hand, the incidences of fatigue, stomatitis, rash, and mucosal inflammation were 
higher in the regorafenib groups of pool 1 and pool 3 (with a difference of at least 5%) compared to pool 
2. There were no new signals based on laboratory parameters. As expected in HCC subjects owing to the 
underlying liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis, hepatitis) elevations in AST, ALT, and bilirubin were more 
frequently recorded in the RESORCE trial than previously seen in the CRC and GIST subjects. 
The incidences of dose modifications were comparable across the pools, however, the incidence of AEs 
leading to discontinuation of study drug were highest in HCC in both regorafenib and placebo group.  
Overall, there was no pattern seen in grade 5 adverse events and the events were distributed across 
different MedDRA SOCs. 
Overall, the safety profile as reported in the pool 3 and pool 1 did not raise new safety signals except for 
pancreatitis which was classified as a new ADR and infection which has been added newly as an important 
identified risk based on the additional cases reported in the RESORCE study. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile for regorafenib in patients with HCC has been demonstrated in a reasonable number of 
patients with HCC which allow determination of uncommon adverse events. The overall safety profile is in 
line with that is known for regorafenib and mainly related to its primary mechanism of actions as a 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Most events were of grade 3 severity and can be resolved by dose modifications 
and concomitant medications. Pancreatitis is the only new ADR, whereas infections have been newly 
added as important identified risk. A warning on infections has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
as well which is considered sufficient. Follow-up through routine pharmacovigilance activities for long-
term safety in HCC is considered sufficient. There does not appear to be an increased risk of severe liver 
toxicity in patients with HCC. Only patients screened for large oesophageal varices and treated were 
included in the study. A precautionary statement has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to address 
the known risk of bleedings.  
The main uncertainty in the safety data concerns the exclusion of patients who permanently discontinued 
sorafenib therapy due to sorafenib-related toxicity. The safety in patients with HCC not tolerating 
sorafenib is therefore unknown. As sorafenib belongs to the same pharmacological class, there might 
have been an underreporting of certain adverse events and especially serious adverse events in HCC. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
The MAH will conduct a non-interventional PASS to address uncertainties on safety related to certain 
populations excluded from the pivotal trial: e.g. Child Pugh B and ECOG PS2 and patients stopping 
previous treatment with sorafenib due to toxicity.

For the current application for HCC, the risk of ‘infections’ was added as an important identified risk to the 
list of safety specifications. Furthermore following completion of a phase I study which evaluated the 
pharmacokinetics and safety of regorafenib in cancer subjects with severe renal impairment the missing 
information ‘safety in patients with severe renal impairment’ was deleted from the safety concerns. 
Finally patients who experienced severe drug toxicity of sorafenib leading to permanent discontinuation of 
treatment were excluded from the pivotal phase III trial in HCC patients. As a consequence “Safety in 
HCC patients who discontinued prior sorafenib therapy due to sorafenib-related toxicity” was included as 
missing information.

The table of risk minimisation measures was adjusted to reflect the changes to the list of safety concerns, 
but routine risk minimisation measures were considered sufficient to minimise the newly added risks of 
the regorafenib in the new indication. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Particularly, new warnings with regard to the increased incidence of infections, screening for 
large oesophageal varices and in patients who had issues in tolerating sorafenib has been added to the 
product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representatives of United Kingdom. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Stivarga. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found 
acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HCC  is  a  cancer  that  usually  occurs  in  the  setting  of  liver  cirrhosis,  because  of  chronic  infections  with 
hepatitis  B  virus  or  hepatitis  C  virus,  alcohol  consumption,  non-alcoholic  steatohepatitis,  or  diabetes 
(EASL&EORTC 2012).  
It is the third-leading cause of cancer-related death, and the global incidence is rising, with approximately 
700,000 cases diagnosed worldwide in 2012 alone (Lozano et al. 2010, Torre et al. 2015). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For patients who are not or who are no longer candidates for loco regional therapy, the oral multikinase 
inhibitor sorafenib is the only systemic treatment currently approved in the EU. The approval was based 
on the results of a large Phase-3 clinical trial (Study 100554 SHARP) conducted in 602 HCC patients 
(Llovet et al. 2008). The study demonstrated significantly increased survival under sorafenib (plus BSC) 
compared to placebo (plus BSC) (HR 0.69; p=0.0005), with a median survival rate for the sorafenib arm 
of 10.6 months, compared with 7.9 months for the placebo arm. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study supporting this application is study 15982 (RESORCE), a multi-centre, multi-national, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial comparing regorafenib plus BSC versus 
placebo plus BSC in patients with HCC who have progressed after sorafenib. A total of 573 patients were 
randomized (2:1) to receive either regorafenib or matching placebo 160 mg OD orally for 3 weeks 
followed by 1 week off therapy (cycle of 4 weeks). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The results of the final OS analysis based on 373 events (65%) (cut-off 29 Feb 2016) show a statistically 
significant improvement in OS for regorafenib compared with placebo (HR 0.627, 95% CI 0.50-0.785, 
p=0.00002), with a gain in median OS of about 2.8 months in favour of regorafenib (median OS 10.6 vs 
7.8 months, respectively). The robustness of the OS effect is supported by several sensitivity and 
subgroup analyses, the results of which are essentially in line with the primary analysis. No significant 
imbalance in post-study therapies was observed. An updated OS analysis (cut-off date 23 January 2017) 
has been provided confirming the results of the primary analysis 
Regarding the secondary endpoints, consistency was observed in terms of PFS according to both 
mRECIST (HR 0.455, 95% CI 0.371-0.558, median PFS 1.5 and 3.1 months with placebo and 
regorafenib, respectively) and RECIST 1.1 (HR 0.427, 95% CI 0.348-0.524, median PFS 1.5 vs 3.4 
months, respectively), as well as TTP (mRECIST: HR 0.442, 95% CI 0.358-0.545, median TTP 3.2 vs 1.5 
months, respectively).  
Overall response rate (ORR: CR+PR) in regorafenib treated patients was low (10.6%), but higher than 
the placebo arm (4.1%). Disease control rate was significantly higher in the regorafenib arm compared to 
the placebo arm (64.5% vs 36.1%, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017 
Page 85/91 
 
  
  
Consistent results in terms of median OS, TTP, ORR and DCR were reported in the supportive phase II 
single arm 14596 study (median OS 13.8 months, median TTP 4.3 months, ORR: 2.8%, DCR: 72.2%). Of 
note, enrolment criteria were quite similar in the two (RESORCE and 14596) studies, but in the 14596 
trial the majority of patients (72%) were Whites. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the 15982 and 14596 studies, patients who had to discontinue sorafenib due to toxicity or for whom 
the sorafenib dose had to be reduced to less than 400 mg OD were excluded. Therefore, no data on the 
efficacy and safety of regorafenib in this subgroup of the population are available. This has been reflected 
as a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
In contrast with the population included in the pivotal and supportive studies (as indicated by their 
enrolment criteria) the HCC patient population treated in clinical practice is very heterogeneous in terms 
of disease burden/presence of comorbidity and includes also patients with ECOG PS >1, Child Pugh B and 
C, with significant renal impairment, with cardiovascular co-morbidities, with untreated/uncontrolled 
oesophagus varices, requiring anti-viral therapy for HBV and HCV and/or patients stopping sorafenib due 
to unacceptable toxicity. Such patients were not enrolled in the RESORCE study and this has been 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The OS effect appears less pronounced (and not statistically significant) in several subgroups of the 
population (females, patients with ECOG PS 1, with underlying hepatitis C or alcohol abuse as well as in 
absence of extra-hepatic disease). This could be related to the relatively limited sample size of these 
subgroups.  
The low ORR observed in the regorafenib arm (10.6%) is disappointing. The significant difference 
between the two study arms in DCR, PFS and OS appears to be essentially driven by patients 
experiencing disease stabilisation under treatment, with therefore minor effects on disease-related 
symptoms. 
Indeed, assessments of Quality of Life/PRO’s in the pivotal RESORCE trial according to the EQ-5D and the 
Fact Hep scores showed no remarkable difference between the two study arms regarding deterioration of 
Quality of Life. However, a numerical trend towards lower scores (and therefore worse Quality of Life and 
more symptoms) for patients treated with regorafenib is consistently observed in the evaluation of the 
single domains of the questionnaires, in particular at the later cycles of treatment, achieving also the 
MID, suggesting a potential detrimental effect of regorafenib due to treatment-related toxicity.  
It is regrettable that submission of tumour material/plasma was optional and not mandatory for patients 
enrolled in the pivotal RESORCE study. Indeed, considering that regorafenib is presented as a multiple 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a compelling biomolecular analysis could have helped to identify a marker 
predictive for tumour response. The MAH is recommended to provide the results of the genetic biomarker 
analysis once available. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of regorafenib in patients with HCC in general resembles what is known for the already 
authorised indications of CRC and GIST and what is known for products inhibiting VEGFR and other 
tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways. Over 90% of patients on regorafenib experienced at least one TEAE 
or a drug-related TEAE. The most frequently reported adverse events for regorafenib were HFSR 
(51.6%), diarrhoea (41.2%), and hypertension (30.7%). Hypertension (14.7%) and HFSR (12.3%) were 
also the most commonly reported grade 3 AEs in the regorafenib arm. Most commonly reported grade 4 
AEs were lipase increased (1.9%) and AST increased (1.1%). HFSR, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017 
Page 86/91 
 
  
  
hypertension, and fatigue were also the most commonly reported drug-related AEs occurring ≥20% of 
patients. HFSR, hypertension, decreased appetite and fatigue most frequently occurred within the first 
weeks of treatment, whereas diarrhoea occurred later during treatment. Most cases were of grade 1-2 
severity, for hypertension events this was grade 2 or 3, and most events resolved by dose modifications 
and/or application of standard of care treatment. Dose modification due to regorafenib was seen in 
68.2% of patients; permanent discontinuation occurred in 24.9% on regorafenib compared to 19.2% on 
placebo. 
Pancreatitis was the only new ADR identified reported in 1.6% of regorafenib treated patients in HCC (0% 
placebo), the majority of events being of mild to moderate severity. The overall incidence in placebo-
controlled studies accumulates to 0.5% and pancreatitis has been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Drug-related SAEs were reported at higher frequencies for regorafenib (10.4% vs 2.6%). The most 
commonly reported SAEs in the regorafenib arm were general physical health deterioration, ascites and 
hepatic failure which were reported at comparable or higher frequencies in the placebo group.  
Incidence rates of transaminases and bilirubin increased were high and more often seen in the 
regorafenib arm than in the placebo arm. 
Overall, a higher incidence of grade 5 infections with fatal outcome was reported for regorafenib (1.3% vs 
0%) and infection has been added now as an important identified risk. Most fatal infections concerned 
respiratory infections. A warning has been included in section 4.4 with reference to section 4.8. In cases 
of worsening infection events, interruption of regorafenib treatment should be considered. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Patients that discontinued prior sorafenib therapy due to sorafenib-related toxicity are not included in the 
study.  Therefore,  safety  in  those  patients  with  HCC  is  unknown.  As  sorafenib  belongs  to  the  same 
pharmacological class, there might have been an underreporting of certain adverse events and especially 
serious  adverse  events  in  HCC.  The  impact  on  the  reported  safety  profile  for  regorafenib  in  HCC  is 
unknown. No information is available on the extent to which patients with HCC discontinue treatment due 
to sorafenib toxicity and whether these patients are distinct from the HCC population tolerating sorafenib. 
A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect this limitation. 
Only patients screened for oesophageal varices and treated were included in the study. Given the known 
risk of bleedings for regorafenib and the fact that patients with HCC are at risk for oesophageal varices 
bleedings due to portal hypertension, a precautionary statement has been included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC.  
The current data do not indicate an increased risk of hepatotoxicity in patients with HCC. However, it may 
be difficult to disentangle drug-related from disease-related events. Close monitoring of safety is already 
recommended 
for  patients  with  moderate  hepatic 
impairment 
including  dose  modification 
recommendations,  and  use  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  is  not  recommended.  These  risk 
management measures are also considered adequate for patients with HCC. 
The overall patient population with HCC included in the study was relatively healthy (ECOG PS=0 in 65% 
patients) and excluding patients with severe cardiovascular comorbidities. This is adequately addressed in 
sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Long-term  safety  data  for  regorafenib  in  HCC  is  limited.  Given  the  known  long-term  safety  data  from 
other  indications  and  the  reduced  life  expectancy  of  the  patient  population,  follow-up  through  regular 
pharmacovigilance activities is considered sufficient.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic or not amenable for local therapy, progressive after systemic 
treatment with sorafenib, is a highly invalidating and life-threatening condition with an overall infaust 
prognosis. Currently there are no treatment options authorised in the EU for this patient population. 
Therefore, an unmet medical need for such population is acknowledged. In this scenario with no other 
treatment options available and a bad prognosis, an improvement in survival associated with acceptable 
toxicity would represent a conventional outcome measure for patient benefit.  
The benefits of regorafenib for the new proposed indication are essentially based on a statistically 
significant improvement in OS supported by a consistent improvement in PFS, TTP and ORR. Results 
appear mature, robust and consistent in the different sensitivity and subgroup analyses provided. The 
magnitude of the improvement (2.8 months for median OS) is of potential clinical relevance.  
However, due to the stringent enrolment criteria of the pivotal RESORCE and supportive 14596 studies, a 
relatively healthier and more homogeneous HCC population has been studied compared to the 
heterogeneous patient population encountered in clinical practice. The HCC patient population treated in 
clinical practice would also include patients with ECOG PS >1, Child Pugh liver score B and C, with 
significant renal impairment, with cardiovascular co-morbidities, with untreated/uncontrolled oesophagus 
varices, requiring anti-viral therapy for HBV and HCV. Risk minimisation measures, including warnings 
and close monitoring/dose adjustment, together with a description of the most important characteristics 
of the population in section 5.1 of the SmPC, are considered sufficient to address limitation in terms of 
the included population and disease characteristics. 
The efficacy findings are also associated with a treatment related toxicity that appears substantial. In line 
with the already known safety profile of regorafenib, HFSR, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, hypertension 
and fatigue were the AEs most frequently reported. No significant increase of major bleedings events was 
reported in the regorafenib arm compared with the placebo arm. However, strict selection criteria were 
used in the studies in order to avoid inclusion of patients with untreated/uncontrolled oesophagus varices, 
which represent a bleeding risk factor. Evaluation of cancer related symptoms showed no significant 
difference between the two study arms. However, a numerical trend towards lower scores (and therefore 
worse quality of life and more symptoms) for patients treated with regorafenib is observed especially at 
later cycles. Unfortunately, no compelling biomarker analysis, which could potentially help to identify 
parameters for patient selection, was submitted by the applicant. The applicant is recommended to 
submit the genetic biomarker analysis once available. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In view of the poor prognosis of the HCC population, metastatic and/or not amenable for local therapy 
and experiencing disease progression after sorafenib, the results of the pivotal RESORCE trial are 
considered of clinical relevance. The observed 2.8 months gain in median OS, confirmed by the updated 
analysis (cut off 23 January 2017) and supported by consistent improvement in PFS and TTP, is 
considered of clinical benefit and able to outweigh the  substantial treatment related toxicity.  
The lack of efficacy and in particular of safety data in patients discontinuing previous sorafenib treatment 
due to toxicity remains an unresolved issue, which is adequately addressed by a warning in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC. These patients should not be excluded from regorafenib treatment beforehand given that no 
other treatment options are currently available. 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017 
Page 89/91 
 
  
  
The uncertainties regarding the lack of data in patients with ECOG PS >1 and/or Child Pugh B are 
considered sufficiently addressed at this time by the proposed SmPC. In addition, the risk of severe 
bleeding in patients with oesophageal varices and the risk of infections are addressed by a precautionary 
statement in section 4.4.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Stivarga is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, IIIA and 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
IIIB 
approved one  
Extension of indication for Stivarga to include treatment of adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.1 of the EU SmPC are updated. The package leaflet and RMP (version 5.2) have been updated 
accordingly. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Stivarga is similar to Nexavar within the meaning of Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Derogation from market exclusivity 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and 
the following derogation laid down in Article 8.3 of the same Regulation applies: the holder of the 
marketing authorisation for Nexavar has given his consent to the applicant. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8, titled "steps after the authorisation", will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication for Stivarga to include treatment of adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 
Assessment report  
EMA/467788/2017 
Page 90/91 
 
  
  
 
and 5.1 of the EU SmPC are updated. The package leaflet and RMP (version 5.2) have been updated 
accordingly. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0.

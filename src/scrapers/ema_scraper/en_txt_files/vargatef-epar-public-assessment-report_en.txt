2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with nearly 1,825,000 new cases diagnosed in 2012 (13% 
of the total). Lung cancer incidence rates are highest in Northern America and lowest in Middle Africa, but this 
partly reflects varying data quality worldwide.  In Europe, lung cancer is the fourth most common cancer, with 
more than 410,000 new cases diagnosed in 2012 (12% of the total); the highest World age-standardised 
incidence rates for lung cancer in EU are in Hungary for men and Denmark for women; the lowest rates are in 
Sweden for men and Ukraine for women.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men and the 
second leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide, estimated to be responsible for nearly one in five 
(1.59 million deaths, 19.4% of the total). Because of its high fatality (the overall ratio of mortality to incidence 
is 0.87) and the relative lack of variability in survival in different world regions, the geographical patterns in 
mortality closely follow those in incidence.  
Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer cases. Broad histological subtypes of 
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma each account for about 30 to 50% of NSCLC cases. The majority 
of  patients  with  lung  cancer  are  diagnosed  after  the  disease  has  progressed  to  a  more  advanced  stage.  At 
diagnosis,  10%  to  15%  of  patients  have  locally  advanced  cancer  i.e.  stage  IIIB,  and  40%  of  patients  have 
metastatic cancer, i.e. stage IV. The prognosis for advanced stage disease has not changed significantly in the 
past 20 years. With an overall 5-year survival rate of 9-13%, the treatment of NSCLC remains a major clinical 
challenge. 
In patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, systemic chemotherapy is considered the therapeutic 
mainstay and is usually a platinum-combination therapy. Targeted therapies used for the first-line treatment of 
patients with NSCLC include inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) such as erlotinib and 
gefitinib as well as bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 
However, bevacizumab is not indicated for use in patients with NSCLC of squamous histology due to the 
increased risk of bleeding observed in these patients. 
Despite responses and transient tumour regression on first-line treatment, the tumour will relapse in almost all 
patients. Currently, erlotinib, pemetrexed, and docetaxel are approved as monotherapies for the second-line 
treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. In addition, gefitinib is approved for the treatment of 
patients with tumours harbouring activating EGFR mutations, irrespective of the line of treatment. 
Despite the availability of second-line treatment options for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, 
further treatment options are required to improve therapeutic outcome by prolonging the time until progression, 
to ameliorate signs and symptoms of the disease, and to prolong the overall survival of patients. 
About the product 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 10/138 
  
  
 
 
Nintedanib is a small molecule TKI triple angiokinase inhibitor blocking vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptors (VEGFR 1-3), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR 1-3) kinase activity and platelet-derived 
growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α and β in the low nanomolar range. Nintedanib binds competitively to the ATP 
binding pocket of these receptors and blocks the intracellular signalling which is crucial for the proliferation and 
survival of endothelial as well as perivascular cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells). In addition 
Flt-3, Lck and Src kinases are inhibited. Nintedanib inhibits mitogenactivated protein kinase and Akt signalling 
pathways in 3 cell types contributing to angiogenesis, i.e. endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells, 
resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation. Based on its antiangiogenic action, nintedanib is expected to slow 
tumour growth. The inhibition of tumour autocrine and paracrine growth factor loops involving vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor 
(FGF) is expected to inhibit tumourgenesis. 
The Applicant initially claimed the following indication: 
“Vargatef  is  indicated  in  combination  with  docetaxel  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced, 
metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of adenocarcinoma tumour histology after first line 
chemotherapy.” 
The final indication following a CHMP review of this application is: 
Vargatef is indicated in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced, 
metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of adenocarcinoma tumour histology after 
first-line chemotherapy. 
The recommended dose of Vargatef is 200 mg (2 capsules of 100 mg) taken orally twice daily; administered 
approximately 12 hours apart, preferably with food, on days 2 to 21 of a standard 21-day docetaxel treatment 
cycle, i.e. with Vargatef not to be taken on the same day of the administration of the docetaxel chemotherapy 
(= day 1). If a dose of nintedanib is missed, administration should resume at the next scheduled time at the 
recommended dose. The individual daily doses of nintedanib should not be increased beyond the recommended 
dose to make up for missed doses. The recommended maximum daily dose of 400 mg should not be exceeded. 
Patients may continue therapy with nintedanib after discontinuation of docetaxel for as long as clinical benefit is 
observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Treatment with Vargatef should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
therapies.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as soft capsules containing 100 mg and 150 mg nintedanib (as esilate) as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are medium-chain triglycerides, hard fat, lecithin, gelatin, glycerol (85 %), titanium dioxide, 
iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow and black ink. The black ink of the capsule has the following composition: 
shellac glaze, iron oxide black and propylene glycol. 
The product is available in Alu/Alu blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  the  active  substance  is  ethanesulfonic  acid  -  methyl  (3Z)-3-{[(4-{methyl- 
[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)acetyl]amino}phenyl)amino]-(phenyl)methylidene}-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-6-
carboxylate (1:1) and has the following chemical structure: 
Nintedanib esilate is a bright yellow powder soluble in water. The solubility increases at lower pH and decrease 
at higher pH due to the non-protonated free base which has a low solubility in water.  
At room temperature, the active substance exists only in one single crystalline form. The active substance 
contains no chiral centres. The double bond at C-3 of the indole moiety allows for E/Z isomerism, but the active 
substance is the Z-isomer. 
The chemical structure elucidation has been performed by infrared spectroscopy, 1H NMR and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, ESI-CID mass spectroscopy, ultraviolet absorption (UV), X-ray powder diffraction and x-ray 
diffraction. The molecular formula is confirmed by elemental analysis.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesised in six steps using well defined starting materials. The final active substance 
is purified by crystallisation.  According to the synthetic process described the active substance is obtained as 
the Z-isomer. 
The designation of the starting materials for the synthesis of the active substance has been justified with respect 
to their impurity profiles, their potential for carry-over into the final active substance, their structural complexity 
and with respect to their proximity to the final intermediate and the active substance, respectively.  
The information provided adequately describes the manufacturing including reactions conditions, quantities of 
raw materials and yields.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origins and adequately characterised. The carry-over of impurities, reagents, solvents and catalysts from the 
starting material into the final active substance has been discussed. Adequate in-process controls are applied 
during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediates, starting materials and reagents 
have been presented.  
The active substance is packed in double low density polypropylene plastic bags (clear) and packed inside a fibre

The following parameters were tested: integrity of the packaging material, appearance, chromatographic purity 
(HPLC), water (KF), assay (HPLC), particle size distribution (laser diffraction), alkyl ethanesulfonates, crystalline 
modification and microbiological purity (HPLC). The analytical methods used in the stability studies, which were 
not included in the specifications, have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.Forced degradation studies were conducted by exposing the 
active substance to high temperatures, high humidity, light, different pH values and oxidative conditions. 
Photostability testing following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed on one batch of the active substance. The 
results showed that there are no significant changes for any of the evaluated parameters established for the 
stability studies. Nevertheless, the active substance is sensitive to extreme oxidative conditions and high 
temperatures. 
All stability studies results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the drug development was to develop an immediate release solid oral dosage form, containing 100 
mg and 150 mg of nintedanib as ethanesulfonate salt, considering the physicochemical properties of the active 
substance.  
The selection of the soft capsule formulation was based on the relative high drug load, the properties of the 
active  substance  and  excipient  compatibility  results.  Due  to  the  technology  and  process  available  the 
manufacturing process of this pharmaceutical form minimise the exposure of manufacturing personnel to the 
active substance, which is a highly potent compound. 
Due to poor solubility of nintedanib esilate at neutral conditions, the active substance cannot be formulated as 
solution and is therefore suspended in a lipophilic fill mix. Selection of the lipophilic excipients mix was generally 
based on technical and functional formulation requirements and active substance stability.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and are commonly used for soft gelatin formualtions. 
Their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. Relevant warnings are included in 
section 2 and 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the content of soya lecithin. 
Milled active substance is used to prevent generation of active substance agglomerates in the fill mix.  The 
composition of the 2 dosage strengths is proportional. 
Quality by Design principles were used during development and an acceptable quality target product profile was 
established and the critical quality attributes were defined. A suitable control strategy was applied based on risk 
assessments. The development was used to establish the targets for critical process parameters and critical 
material  attributes  used  for  further  process  validation  and  the  proposed  commercial  manufacturing.  It  is 
important to emphasise that no design space is proposedThe formulation development has been acceptably 
described and the choice of excipients has been justified.

The  composition  of  the  capsule  fill  has  remained  practically  unchanged  during  phases  1  to  3  of  clinical 
development, and is identical with the final  formulation for the commercial product. The composition of the 
capsules  shell  has  changed  only  with  respect  to  the  amount  of  the  used  colorants,  which  was  adjusted  to 
manufacture the desired colors of the capsule shell. The composition of Vargatef capsules 100 mg and 150 mg 
used in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials is identical with the composition of the proposed commercial product. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. Bioequivalence study was 
performed showing bioequivalence between two batches, represented maximum batch-to-batch variability seen 
in the dissolution rate. 
A standard process, utilizing well-established manufacturing technology, is selected for manufacturing of 
Vargatef (100 mg and 150 mg) soft capsules. 
The primary packaging is described as stated in the SmPC. The material complies with Ph Eur and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate 
for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of eight main steps: fill mix preparation, gelatin mass preparation, 
encapsulation, drying, size sorting, washing, printing and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.   
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this type of dosage form: appearance, 
identification (HPLC and UV), Uniformity of dosage Units (Ph Eur), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC) and 
microbiological quality (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis data of 63 commercial batches of the 100 mg strengths and 46 commercial batches of the 150 mg 
strength are provided. The results confirm the consistency of the process and its ability to manufacture a 
product complying with the product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three production scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 36 
months at 25 ºC / 60% RH,  for up to 12 months under at 30ºC / 75% RH  and for up to six months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of 
medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing. 
The parameters tested are appearance, dissolution, impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and microbiological quality 
(Ph Eur). The analytical methods used during the stability studies are the same as used for release testing of the 
finished product.

One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances 
and Products. In addition stress stability studies were performed on one fully representative batch under various 
extreme conditions of humidity and high temperatures. The finished product exposed to high humidity showed 
a decrease in dissolution, changes in the appearance, and an increase in water content of the capsule shell with 
a corresponding decrease in capsule hardness. The temperature stress results in decrease in dissolution and 
decrease in capsule hardness. No changes attributed to light stress were seen. The results obtained for 
temperature and humidity stress underscore the need for a moisture protective packaging material and the 
restriction in storage temperature. 
Based on the all available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from swine sources is used in the product. It was confirmed that the swine sources are from 
healthy animals fit for human consumption. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The main goal of the drug development was to develop an immediate 
release solid oral dosage form, containing 100 mg and 150 mg of nintedanib as ethanesulfonate salt, considering 
the physicochemical properties of the active substance. The development of the medicinal product includes 
elements of Quality by Design (QbD), but no design space has been established or claimed. The manufacturing 
flow-chart was provided with suitable in-process controls. The manufacturing process is adequately validated at 
full scale at the proposed manufacturing site and a validation protocol has been presented.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The primary and secondary pharmacodynamics of nintedanib were investigated in a number of in vitro and in 
vivo studies. Pivotal toxicology studies and most of the safety pharmacology studies were carried-out in 
compliance with GLP.

Scientific advice (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/209064/2007) has been sought on non-clinical aspects (need for 
reproductive toxicity studies).  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
On  the  molecular  level,  nintedanib  is  considered  to  inhibit  the  signaling  cascade  mediating  angiogenesis  by 
binding to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of the VEGFR-2 kinase domain, thus interfering with 
cross-activation via autophosphorylation of the receptor homodimers. Besides inhibition of neo-angiogenesis, 
tumour  regression  may  also  be  achieved  by  inducing  apoptosis  of  tumour  blood  vessel  endothelial  cells. 
Inhibition  of  receptor  kinases  may  also  interfere  with  autocrine  and  paracrine  stimulation  of  tumour 
angiogenesis via activation loops involving VEGF, PDGF, and bFGF utilized by perivascular cells such as pericytes 
and vascular smooth muscle cells.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
The in vitro activity of nintedanib was investigated in both enzymatic and cellular assays for vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) inhibition. In order to characterize the potency of nintedanib for inhibition of 
VEGFR-2, its IC50 was determined in an enzymatic VEGFR-2 kinase assay and in a VEGF driven endothelial cell 
proliferation assay. The selectivity of this compound was tested with respect to inhibition of basic fibroblast 
growth factor (bFGF) mediated endothelial cell proliferation and inhibition of tumour cell lines proliferation. 
Sf9-DELFIA assays were used to explore the inhibitory effect of BIBF 1120 on murine VEGFR-2 (flk-1), VEGFR-1 
and  VEGFR-3.  The  efficacy  of  nintedanib  on  blocking  VEGFR-2  phosphorylation  was  tested  by  western  blot 
hybridization.  
Results in terms of potency of nintedanib for selected kinases are in table 1.

In order to determine the duration of receptor inhibition induced by nintedanib, washout experiments were 
performed.  VEGFR-2 transfected NIH3T3 cells were exposed to BIBF 1120 for a limited period of time.  
Nintedanib was washed off and VEGFR-2 activation/phosphorylation was analyzed after various periods of time.  
After 8 h, 24 h, or 32 h without BIBF 1120, the cells were stimulated with VEGF and receptor activation was 
analyzed. 
Nintedanib exhibited a strong VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity in vitro. In a HUVEC proliferation assay was 
demonstrated that a short pulse (2 hrs) of nintedanib treatment followed by an (up to) 46 hrs "washout" period 
was sufficient to block cell proliferation 
BIBF 1202, the main metabolite of BIBF 1120, inhibits VEGFR-2, FGFR1 and PDGFRα with IC50 values of 62 nM, 
240 nM and 433 nM, respectively. VEGF-stimulated HUVEC cell proliferation is inhibited with an EC50 value of 
133 nM. Thus, BIBF 1202 inhibits angiokinase activity with lower potency than BIBF 1120.  
Nude mice carrying established FaDu tumors were treated with 30 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally (IP) of either 
BIBF 1120 or BIBF 1202. After 20 days, the BIBF 1120 treated tumors had not even doubled their volume, 
whereas  the  BIBF  1202  treated  tumors  had  increased  their  volumes  by  a  factor  of  >10  (similar  to  the 
mock-treated control tumors) compared to the size of the tumors at the start of treatment (Figure X) (BIBF 1120 
chloride and BIBF 1202 were used in these experiments; U05- 1930). In conclusion, no in vivo activity of BIBF 
1202 could be observed. 
Plasma concentrations of BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1120 were analysed at the end of the in vivo efficacy experiments 
2, 5 and 24 hours after the last administration. The Cmax for BIBF 1202 was 5.1 +/- 2.1 μM and for BIBF 1120 
0.96 +/- 0.19 μM.  
Figure 1 Anti-tumour efficacy of BIBF 1120 and BIBF 1202 on FaDu Xenografts in nude mice. 
The  effects  of  BIBF  1120  on  intracellular  signalling  were  assessed  in  short-term  cellular  assays  by  Western 
blotting using phospho-specific antibodies to signalling molecules such as MAPK, Akt and Caspase 3. 
In HUVEC endothelial cells, apoptosis was preceded by inhibition of MAPK and Akt phosphorylation (Figure 2A). 
The apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3 was up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner in both VEGF- 
and bFGF- stimulated HUVEC (U08-1946).

Pericytes, important for vessel maturation and stabilization, are known to express PDGF receptors. BIBF 1120 
inhibited proliferation of PDGF-BB-stimulated bovine retinal pericytes (BRP) with an EC50 of 79 nM (Table 2). 
Signaling pathway analysis demonstrated that activation of MAPK following stimulation with 5% serum plus 
PDGF-BB could be blocked by BIBF 1120 at concentrations down to 100 nM. Stimulation of BRP with 5% serum 
plus bFGF blocked MAPK phosphorylation but not concentration-dependently.

The kinase domain of VEGFR-2 was recombinantly expressed as a GST fusion protein in a baculovirus expression 
system. After cleavage of the GST-tag, the kinase domain was in vitro phosphorylated and cocrystallized with 
the ligand. Diffraction data of the VEGFR-2 kinase crystals in complex with BIBF 1120 were collected.  
The X-ray structure of VEGFR-2 kinase in complex with the ligand BIBF 1120 (Figure below) was solved at a 
resolution of 2.1 Å. The crystal contains one monomer of VEGFR-2 kinase in the asymmetric unit. BIBF 1120 is 
bound at the ATP-binding site in the cleft between the N- and C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain.  
In vivo studies  
The in vivo anti-tumour efficacy of BIBF 1120 was analysed at different doses (10-100 mg/kg daily orally) in 
three different tumour models. The main results are as follows:  
-  Human  FaDu  xenografts  on  nude  mice  showed  complete  growth  arrest  at  doses  of  100  mg/kg 
(T/C=11%) and 2x50 mg/kg (T/C=15%) and even at 1x50 mg/kg (T/C=27%) a statistically significant 
anti-tumour effect was observed. 
-  Caki-1 tumour xenografts also responded well to the treatment with BIBF1120 at doses of 100 mg/kg 
(T/C=13%) and 50 mg/kg (T/C=35%). 
-  Using the syngeneic GS9L rat tumour model BIBF1120 demonstrated anti-tumour efficacy at doses of 
50 mg/kg (T/C=30%) and 25 mg/kg (T/C=45%). 
- 
Treatment  of  Caki-1  tumours  with  100  mg/kg/day  for  five  days  resulted  in  the  reduction  of  tumour 
vessel density of about 80%

*Nude mice bearing established human xenografts (0.05 - 0.1 cm³ volume) were treated once or twice daily with BIBF 1120 p.o. (10 – 100 
mg/kg) or vehicle control. For T/C values, the median tumour volume of each treatment group was compared to the median of the control group 
at the end of the experiment.  
#Results of an independent experimental series. 
$GS-9L is a syngeneic rat tumour glioma model that has grown s.c. 
Plasma levels were determined as part of the study, after single oral administration of 100 mg/kg in NMRI nu/nu 
mice and 50 mg/kg in Fischer 344 rats. The calculated plasma levels at the Cmax were ~700nM and ~200nM, 
respectively 
Efficacy of BIBF 1120 in combination with pemetrexed or carboplatin in nude mouse xenograft models of human 
cancer (U11-1283-01, study no BIRCV07-10)  
In a model of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (Calu-6), addition of BIBF 1120 to a regimen of pemetrexed therapy 
was assessed. In the same study a model of ovarian carcinoma (SKOV-3), addition of BIBF 1120 to a regiment 
of carboplatin therapy was also evaluated.  
In the Calu-6 study (10 animals per group), BIBF 1120 was dosed at 50 mg/kg once daily PO. Pemetrexed was 
initially dosed at 125 mg/kg qdx5 per week IP; due to intolerability in the combination arm the dose was reduced 
to 100 mg/kg on day 23. In the SKOV-3 study (7 animals per group, except for 10 in the control group), 
carboplatin was dosed by IP injection of 75 mg/kg on day 1, followed by oral BIBF 1120 at 25 mg/kg daily on 
days 2 to 7 of each week. 
In the Calu-6 study, T/C values of 36%, 49% and 18% were observed for BIBF 120 monotherapy, pemetrexed 
monotherapy and combination therapy respectively. In the SKOV-3 study, T/C values of 48%, 82% and 16% 
were observed for BIBF 1120 monotherapy, carboplatin monotherapy and combination therapy respectively.In 
both experiments at least additive anti-tumour effects were observed and the treatment groups receiving the 
combination did not show additional adverse effects.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Effect on CNS 
Irwin Test: BIBF 1120 chloride was administered in oral doses of 50, 100 and 300 mg/kg to male mice.  General 
overt  and  covert  behaviour  and  body  temperature  were  assessed  at  15,  30,  60  minutes,  and  24  hours 
post-administration.  There was no effect on any of the tested behavioural parameter and on body temperature.  
A yellow discoloration of urine was noted 60 min following the 100 and 300 mg/kg dose. 
Nocturnal motility: BIBF 1120 chloride was administered orally in doses of 50, 100 and 300 mg/kg in groups of 
7 mice.  There was no inhibition or activation of locomotion by BIBF 1120 at any of the doses tested as compared 
to vehicle-treated animals (U02-1589). 
Electrophysiological  assessment  in  vitro  (U02-1288):  Two  assays  (hERG  and  action  potential  configuration) 
assessing the effects of BIBF 1120 base on the electrophysiological parameters in vitro. In the hERG assay, 
concentrations of 0.1, 1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 µM was tested in triplicate and the mean fraction of HERG current (I/I0) 
obtained  was  0.92,  0.83,  0.53  and  0.25  respectively.  BIBF  1120  base  had  an  IC50  value  of  4.0  µM  on 
hERG-mediated potassium current in HEK293 cells. 
Action potential configuration: In isolated papillary muscles from guinea pigs, the effect of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 
10.0 µM BIBF 1120 base on action potential duration (ADP) to 10%, 30% and 90% repolarisation (ADP10, ADP30 
and ADP90 respectively), resting membrane potential, maximal velocity oof phase 0 upstroke, AP overshoot, AP 
amplitude and the force of concentration was tested (N=5). In the current study setting, BIBF 1120 base had no 
effect on APD 90 in concentrations up to 10 µM, or any other measured parameters. No effect was observed on 
myocardial repolarisation at human therapeutic plasma concentrations. 
Effect on Cardiovascular and Respiratory function  
In the study performed in conscious rats (U02-1398), chronically instrumented rats received a single oral dose 
of 0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg BIBF 1120 CL, and the systolic arterial pressure, heart rate, temperature, motility and 
respiration rate and volume were recorded. Systemic arterial blood pressure increased dose-dependently.  This 
effect lasted up to the end of the seven hour post-administration observation period.  The increase in systolic 
systemic  blood  pressure was  about  15  mm  Hg  in  the  highest  dose group.  No  effects  were  observed  for  the 
remaining parameters measured. 
Anaesthetised domestic pigs (study U2-1674-02) were administered increasing doses of BIBF 1120 chloride by 
intravenous infusion, starting at 3.0 mg/kg, escalating to 10 and 30 mg/kg in 30 minute intervals. The following 
parameters  were  measured  and  determined:  systolic  and  diastolic  arterial  blood  pressure,  maximal  left 
ventricular  dP/dt  (LVdP/dtmax),  heart  rate  and  ECG-intervals  (QT,  PR,  QRS)  from  the  electrocardiogram. 
Decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (see figure 1 below) and in LVdP/dt-max (see figure 3 below) 
was observed after starting the infusion of the highest dose (30 mg/kg). These effects reversed after the end of 
dosing.  No  relevant  changes  were  observed  in  the  electrocardiographic  parameters  (QT-,  QRS-,  and  PR 
interval). 
Effect on Renal and hepatic function in rats  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014

Metabolic markers of renal and liver function were measured in both serum (Day 7 only) and urine (Days 1 and 
6) in rats (study U02-1260) treated orally with BIBF 1120 chloride at doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg for 7 days. 
After 7 days there was an up to 1.6-fold increase in serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) in the animals 
given 100 mg/kg.  Also in this dose group, there was an increase of similar magnitude in serum triglyceride 
concentration.  Serum electrolytes were largely unchanged except for a mild increase in calcium at 100 mg/kg. 
BIBF 1120 caused a modest increase in urine volume and urine sodium (1.3-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively) 
between  4  and  8  hours  post  administration  of  100  mg/kg  on  Day  1.    There  was  also  a  1.5-fold  increase  in 
beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (beta-NAG) between 4 and 8 hours post-administration on Day 1 and a ~3-fold 
increase in Ca2+-output between 4 and 8 hours at 30 and 100 mg/kg.  At Day 6, the effects on urine volume, 
sodium and calcium were absent. 
Effect on Gastrointestinal function in rats (U02-1248, U02-1258 and U02-1259) 
Gastric function and gastrointestinal motility were assessed in male and female rats (N=5 per sex) treated orally 
with 0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg of BIBF 1120 chloride (U02-1258).  The doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg induced no 
statistically significant effects on gastric emptying.  At 100 mg/kg a significant inhibition of gastric emptying was 
observed).  Effects  on  gastric  acid  output,  total  acidity,  gastric  pH  and  volume  following  intraduodenal 
administration  of  0,  10,  30  or  100  mg/kg  BIBF  1120  chloride  to  groups  of  7-8  male  rats  was  assessed 
(U02-1248). No effects on gastric acid output, total acidity, gastric pH and volume were observed.   
The effects of BIBF 1120 chloride on gastrointestinal transit was investigated following administration of 0, 10, 
30 or 100 mg/kg BIBF 1120 chloride PO to male and female animals (5/sex/group). The gastrointestinal transit 
was  determined  as  the  percentage  of  the  intestine  length  traversed  by  the  test  meal.  BIBF  1120  did  not 
influence  gastrointestinal  transit  at  10 mg/kg  PO,  but  at  30  and  100 mg  /kg,  intestinal  transit  was 
does-dependently reduced (U02-1259). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
There  was  no  stand-alone  GLP  cardiovascular  safety  study,  however,  cardiovascular  parameters  have  been 
assessed  in  non-GLP  studies  described  in  secondary  pharmacodynamics  section  performed  in  rats  and 
anaesthetized  domestic  pigs  (U02-1398  and  U02-1674).  The  following  safety  pharmacology  core  battery 
assessment was performed according to GLP, either as part of a repeat dose study (cardiovascular function in 
Cynomolgus monkeys) or in single dose studies (CNS and respiratory effects in rats). 
Effect  on  Cardiovascular  function  (Cynomolgus  monkeys  -  as  part  of  the  4  week  repeat  dose  toxicity  study 
U03-1326, GLP) 
In the Cynomolgus monkeys study, dose levels were 0, 3, 15 and 60 mg/kg/day.  Electrocardiography (ECG) 
was recorded for all animals pre-treatment, prior to dosing on Day 1 as well as 2 and 24 hours after treatment 
on  Day  1.  In  week  4  of  treatment,  all  animals  in  groups  1  to  3  had  ECG’s  performed  2  and  24  hours  after 
treatment. Only 2 Group 4 animals were examined, as the remaining animals in this group had been terminated 
on Days 14 and 15 of the study due to clinical signs, and the two remaining animals had been of dosing since Day 
15 (e.g. 2 weeks recovery). Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) measurements were also performed. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 22/138 
  
  
 
 
Slight fluctuations were observed in the beats per minute heart rate (HR) on Day 1 pre-dose (HR 192-270), 
where  most  animals  exhibited  increased  heart  rate  compared  to  the  measurement  performed  earlier  in  the 
pre-dose period (HR 156-258). In the high dose group a minor increase in heart rate at 60 mg/kg/day by 5.7% 
versus  the  control  group  on  Day 1  at  2 h  post  dosing.  No  other  relevant  effects  on  electrocardiographic 
parameters were found. 
Blood pressure data showed a slight tendency to decreased mean systolic pressure in the high-dose males and 
females on Day 1, 2 hours after dosing resulting from the slightly reduced individual values of 2 males and 3 
females. After 24 hours, their values returned to levels similar to the pre-dose values except for female no. 453. 
Since a slight trend to decreased systolic pressure was also observed in the control group and similar values 
were also observed during the pre-dose period, this finding is considered not to be related to treatment. 
Effect on respiratory function (in rats using study U03-1465) 
In this study, doses of 3, 20 and 100 mg/kg BIBF 1120 (as base) as a single PO dose was administered to male 
and female Wistar rats (8/sex/group). Morphine sulphate (200 mg/kg) was used as a positive control, to ensure 
that  the  assay  was  performing  as  expected.  The  respiratory  parameters;  respiration  rate,  tidal  volume  and 
minute volume, were recorded pre-dose, at 30, 90, 150 and 300 minutes after dosing, as well as 24 hours after 
dosing. The rats were placed in the chambers for approximately 16 minutes at each observation time point (from 
8 minutes before the time point to 8 minutes after). All groups (including the control group) showed the highest 
group mean respiration rate prior to treatment, approximately 350 breaths/minute, and the lowest group mean 
respiration  rates  were  recorded  at  150  minutes  after  dosing  (158-218  breaths/minute).  However,  the  only 
statistically significant difference observed between the control and treated groups, were at 30 and 90 minutes 
post dosing in the positive control group, treated with morphine sulphate.  
No marked or statistically significant changes following administration of BIBF 1120 were observed with regards 
to respiration rate, tidal volume or minute volume when compared to the vehicle treated animals.  
Effects on general behaviour, body temperature and spontaneous locomotor activity in rats (U02-1537, GLP) 
BOBF 1120ES was administered PO to rats (4 animals/sex/group) at doses of 0, 3, 20, 100 mg/kg. Subjective 
observations performed to assess the behaviour and physiological state of the animals were performed prior to 
dosing, and at 30, 90, 150 and 300 minutes as well as 24 hours after treatment. Assessment of locomotor 
activity and body temperature (measured rectally) was also performed at the same time points. The animals 
were kept under observation for 7 days after treatment to record signs of toxicity or mortalities.  
Oral administration of BIBF 1120 ES at doses of 3, 20 and 100 mg/kg (as base) produced no significant test 
article-induced changes in the behaviour or physiological state of rats. One female rat treated with 20 mg/kg 
BIBF 1120 exhibited slight tremor and piloerection at 30 and 90 minutes and slight tremor at 150 minutes post 
treatment. As only one animal at the intermediate dose level exhibited these mild changes, it was considered to 
be  incidental,  and  not  related  to  treatment.  In  addition,  no  significant  effects  on  locomotor  activity  or  body 
temperature were recorded in this study.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No investigations on pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been submitted.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism of BIBF 1120  were studied in mice, rats, Cynomolgus 
monkeys and Rhesus monkeys and were compared to the pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism of BIBF 1120 
in humans.   The species and strains were identical with those used in pharmacology and toxicity studies. A 
number of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays was developed and validated 
in order to quantify BIBF 1120, the major metabolites BIBF 1202 (M1) and BIBF 1202 glucuronide (M2) as well 
as CDBB 213 (BIBF 1120 Anilin) in plasma samples from several species. A number of non-validated methods 
were  utilized  for  sample  analyses  in  some  range  finding  and  PK  studies;  these  methods  followed  the  same 
general assay concept as the validated methods.  
Absorption  
In vitro studies of BIBF 1120 absorption in cells showed that permeability through bio-membranes was high, 
e.g. within minutes, the BIBF 1120 radioactivity was associated with the cell fraction in the test system, both at 
37˚C and 4˚C the transport process was most likely passive.  
Bioavailability was low in humans (4.7%) as well as the non clinical species approximately 11% (rat) to 23.8% 
(rhesus monkey). High metabolism Intestinal P-gp activity was suspected to contribute to the low bioavailability 
due  to  incomplete  absorption  form  the  intestinal  tract.  In  addition,  first  pass  metabolism  in  the  liver  and 
intestine further contribute to the low bioavailability observed. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of BIBF 1120 was high in mice, rats and humans, at 97% to 98.5%, and slightly 
lower in the non-human primates Rhesus and Cynomolgus monkeys (91% to 93%). Tissue distribution studies 
showed that the high binding to plasma protein did not restrict BIBF 1120 to the vascular compartment, but 
rather  rapid  and  extensive  distribution  of  BIBF  1120  was  apparent  in  rat  tissues  at  5  minutes  after  IV 
administration. Repeated oral dosing (30 mg/kg [14C]BIBF 1120) for 13 days showed a slight accumulation in 
some  tissues  (testes,  salivary  gland,  epididymides  and  liver),  albeit  a  similar  accumulation  in  plasma 
concentrations was not apparent.  
Placental  transfer  of  BIBF  1120  was  not  examined,  although  maternal  exposure  was  determined  in 
embryo-foetal development studies, no exposure data was generated for the foetuses, and no conclusions on 
the possible placental transfer can be made. Excretion of BIBF 1120 into milk was examined in female Wistar 
rats on Day 12 of lactation, and the average concentration at 1 hour after dosing was approximately 10-fold 
lower  than  the  plasma  concentration  (269  and  2260  ng/mL  respectively).  The  total  estimated  BIBF  1120 
radioactivity secreted to milk over a 24 hour period was 0.18-0.5%. 
Metabolism 
BIBF 1120 showed high clearance in all species. Metabolic elimination was the major clearance pathway, with 
m1 (BIBF 1202) as the primary metabolite excreted via in faeces in all species. Approximately 10 to 30 % of the 
orally  administered  BIBF  1120  was  recovered  unchanged  in  the  faeces  of  the  nonclinical  species,  and 
approximately 20 % was recovered in human faeces. In the tabularised presentation of the major metabolites 
in  plasma  (as  %  of  sample  radioactivity),  the  metabolite  M7  is  listed  to  represent  11.6%.  The  remaining 
metabolites following oral administration of BIBF 1120 was present in smaller amounts less than 10% for most 
except in mice, where m3 and m4 was present at approximately 10 and 20 % respectively.

Excretion 
Excretion and mass balance studies were carried out in mice, rats, Rhesus monkeys and human subjects using 
[14C]-radio-labelled  BIBF 1120.  Following  both  IV  and  PO  dosing,  the  major  fraction  of  radioactivity  was 
recovered in faeces. Following IV dose, biliary excretion was the major contributing factor, however, following 
oral  dose,  the  amount  secreted in  the  bile  was  significantly  less.  Urinary  excretion  of  BIBF  1120  associated 
radioactivity was largest following IV dose (approximately 5% of the dose) whereas following PO dose, this was 
much smaller (1.2, 1.5 and 0.65 % in rat, Rhesus monkey and human respectively). This is probably due to 
incomplete absorption of BIBF 1120 form the intestinal tract.

The major route of excretion of BIBF 1120 following IV dose is faecal and biliary with approximately 5% of the 
dose being excreted via urine. Following PO dose, faecal excretion is higher in the rat, but similar in the Rhesus 
monkey, and urinary excretion decreases to approximately 1.5 % in the nonclinical species. Biliary excretion is 
higher following IV administration than PO administration, indicating together with the lower urinary excretion 
that absorption from the intestinal tract following PO administration is incomplete. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions  
Dose-dependent  inhibition  of  OCT1  by  BIBF  1120  was  demonstrated,  but  not  of  other  hepatic  transporters 
tested.  The  IC50  value  of  BIBF  1120  for  OCT1  was  estimated  to  be  0.88  μM  i.e.  12.4-fold  higher  than  the 
maximum  plasma  concentration  of  BIBF  1120  (37.9  ng/mL:  0.071  μM)  after  200  mg  oral  administration  to 
humans. Therefore, potent inhibition of OCT1 by BIBF 1120 under in vivo conditions is considered unlikely.  
Efflux transport studies suggest involvement of P-gp in the biliary and urinary excretion of BIBF 1120, while 
P-gp, MRP2 and BCRP appear to have little role in the biliary and urinary excretion of BIBF 1202.  
CHMP assessment report

BIBF 1202 glucuronide is a substrate of BCRP and MRP2, but not of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1 and OCT1. 
Transport of BIBF 1202 glucoronide by P-gp was not performed due to experimental limitations.  
[14C]BIBW 2992 MA2 was metabolized under formation of U1 (BIBW 2992 MA2 N-oxide) and U2 (N-demethyl 
BIBW 2992 MA2). BIBF 1120 ES up to a concentration of 50 μM had no apparent effect on the in vitro microsomal 
metabolism  of  [14C]BIBW  2992  MA2,  neither  on  metabolite  formation  nor  on  the  metabolic  depletion  of 
[14C]BIBW 2992 MA2. 
[14C]BIBF 1120 ES was metabolized under formation of U1 (di-demethyl BIBF 1120 ES), U2 (BIBF 1202, i.e. 
O-demethyl  BIBF  1120  ES)  and  U4  (BIBF  1053,  i.e.  N-demethyl  BIBF  1120  ES).  BIBW  2992  MA2  up  to  a 
concentration of 50 μM had some minor inhibitory effect on the formation of U1, U2 and U4 and consequently 
reduced the metabolic turnover of BIBF 1120 ES. However, the effect was only minor and an IC50 could not be 
calculated as the inhibition was < 50 % at the highest concentration of BIBW 2992 MA2 (50 μM). 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
The  pharmacokinetic  properties of  BIBF  1120  as  well  as  its  phase  I  metabolite  BIBF  1202  and  the  phase  II 
metabolite BIBF 1202-glucuronide were investigated in rats after single intravenous doses (U10-2525).  BIBF 
1120 was additionally investigated after single oral doses. Pharmacokinetics of BIBF 1120 is characterized by a 
high volume of distribution (2.86 L/kg for the central compartment and 15.7 L/kg at steady state) and a high 
plasma clearance of 91.8 (mL/min)/kg.   
For BIBF 1202, the volumes of distribution were markedly smaller than those for BIBF 1120 (approximately 0.4 
and  0.3  L/kg,  respectively),  but  still  considerably  greater  than  the  plasma  or  blood  volume  of  the  rat.  The 
clearance of BIBF 1202 was moderate with 25.9 (mL/min)/kg.   
The glucuronide of BIBF 1202 was distributed almost instantaneously into a volume of approximately the plasma 
space of the rat (0.0389 L/kg) and showed an only slightly higher volume of distribution at steady state (V(ss) 
of 0.0556 L/kg). 
The oral administration of BIBF 1120 led to absolute bioavailabilities of 10.9% for BIBF 1120, 2.2% for BIBF 
1202 and 2.5% for BIBF 1202-glucuronide. The metabolites BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202-glucuronide were mainly 
formed pre-systemically after oral dosing of BIBF 1120. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology program included studies performed in rodents and non-rodents (dogs, minipigs, cynomolgous 
and rhesus monkeys).  
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies were performed in mice and rats, with both oral and intravenous injection (see table

In the rodent studies of longer duration than 14 days, dentopathy was observed at dose levels above 20 
mg/kg/day and consequently lower body weight and body weight gains were also observed. Due to the observed 
dentopathies, powdered diet was offered to the animals.  
13-week (MTD) study in mice (U10-1798) 
The objective of this 13-week toxicity study was to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of BIBF 1120, when 
administered to mice over 13 weeks, and to aid the selection of dose levels for a subsequent carcinogenicity 
study. BIBF 1120 was administered at dosages of 0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks to four groups of 
animals, each comprising 12 male and 12 female CD-1 mice. In order to obtain blood samples for toxicokinetics, 
a further 8 males and females were allocated to the control group, and 12 male and females to the treated 
groups.  During  the  study,  clinical  condition,  bodyweight,  food  consumption,  haematology,  blood  chemistry, 
toxicokinetics, organ weight, gross pathology and histopathology investigations were undertaken.

At the end of the 13-week administration period, discoloured white incisors were noted from Week 7 for animals 
given  100  mg/kg/day.  A  broken  tooth  was  also  recorded  in  Weeks  10/11  for  one  female  receiving  100 
mg/kg/day. Overall body weight gain was lower than that of controls for all treated groups in a dose-related 
manner (males/females: 0.74X/0.75X controls at 10 mg/kg/day, 0.59X/0.85X controls at 30 mg/kg/day and 
0.55X/0.54X controls at 100 mg/kg/day).  Haematology investigations revealed low red blood cell count (max. 
effect 0.86X control), low reticulocyte counts for females receiving 30 or 100 mg/kg/day (max. effect 0.63X 
control) and high mean cell haemoglobin and mean cell volume (max. effect 1.2X control) for animals receiving 
30  or  100  mg/kg/day.    Platelet  counts  were  low  (max.  0.80X  control)  for  males  and  females  receiving  100 
mg/kg/day.   
Blood chemistry investigations revealed slightly high bilirubin concentrations for males receiving 100 mg/kg/day 
BIBF 1120 without a histopathological correlate.  Total protein and albumin concentrations were slightly low 
resulting in a slightly low albumin to globulin ratio for females receiving 100 mg/kg/day (max. effect 0.94X 
control). 
Absolute, body weight-relative and brain weight-relative liver weights were low for all treated female groups 
(max. 0.75X control) and, to a lesser extent, for males receiving 30 or 100 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 (max. 0.84X 
control).  Absolute, body weight-relative and brain weight-relative heart weights were low for females receiving 
100 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 (max. 0.81X control). 
Histopathological changes were thickening of the growth plate (due to increased hypertrophic chondrocytes) 
and increased swelling of chondrocytes in the basal layers of the articular cartilage in femur and tibia, cellular 
depletion in the bone marrow, dentopathy of the incisor teeth, increased extramedullary haematopoiesis in the 
spleen and liver, diffuse cortical hypertrophy in the adrenals, and decreased numbers of mature corpora lutea 
and increased numbers of luteinised follicles in the ovaries. 
In summary, oral administration of BIBF 1120 to CD-1 mice at doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks 
was associated with changes in the bone and bone marrow, teeth and spleen of both sexes, in the liver and 
adrenals of males, and in the ovaries of females receiving 100 mg/kg/day. The dosage of 30 mg/kg/day was 
considered to be close to the MTD. NOAEL was not established. 
26-week toxicity study in CrlGlxBrlHan:WI rats (U05-1843) 
Groups of 20 male and 20 female Han Wistar rats received daily oral doses of 0, 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day BIBF 
1120 over a period of 26 weeks, followed by an 8 week recovery period. In order to obtain blood samples for 
toxicokinetics, a further 6 males and females were allocated to each group, and a further 10 male and females 
were allocated to the control and high dose groups to allow for a treatment free period (recovery) at the end of 
the  study.  During  the  study,  mortality,  clinical  condition,  bodyweight,  food  consumption,  ophthalmoscopy, 
haematology, blood chemistry, toxicokinetics, organ weight, gross pathology and histopathology investigations 
were performed. 
5 mg/kg/day dose group: No evident adverse effects considered to be drug-related were observed.

20 mg/kg/day dose group: Two animals (one male, one female) were prematurely sacrificed due to poor general 
condition with histopathological changes indicating a severe (incidental) chronic progressive nephropathy and 
liver hemosiderosis. In males, body weight gain was slightly reduced.  Clinically, 3/20 males and 9/20 females 
had broken incisors (regularly growing back and breaking again) and almost all animals showed swelling and 
reddening of the gingiva. Thymus weight in males was slightly reduced.  Histopathologically, in some animals 
there were minimal to slight drug-related effects on the liver, spleen, kidneys, bone marrow, thymus, ovaries, 
epiphyseal  growth  plates,  articular  cartilage  and  incisors.    All  these  findings  were  dose-related.    They  are 
described below together with those of the 80 mg/kg/day dose group. 
80 mg/kg/day dose group: Five males and three females were found dead or were prematurely sacrificed due to 
poor  general  condition  caused  by  broken  incisors  and  resulting  reduced  food  consumption.    The  remaining 
animals were prematurely sacrificed on day 165/166 (except recovery animals) due to poor general condition 
and lack of body weight gain in males. In males, there was no body weight gain from Day 50 on.   
Findings from both the 20 and 80 mg/kg/day dose groups: Clinical pathology investigations revealed a mild, 
reversible  decrease  in  red  blood  cell  parameters  (red  blood  cell  count,  hematocrit  and  hemoglobin)  and  an 
increase  in  reticulocytes.  White  blood  cell  count  and  platelet  count  were  also  slightly  increased.  Clinical 
chemistry revealed a mild increase in the activity of ALT, aldolase and GLDH in both sexes. Urinalysis revealed 
strongly increased protein concentration and presence of white blood cells in some animals. At the end of the 
recovery period, the activity of aldolase was still increased in both sexes. Microscopically, there were drug- and 
dose-related effects on the liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenals, bone marrow, thymus, ovaries, epiphyseal growth 
plates, joint cartilage, incisors and the main bile duct with adjacent organs. The major findings were graded as 
moderate or severe. Almost all findings were completely reversible or ameliorated during the recovery period 
(high-dose group). 
Findings  which  were  not  observed  or  not  as  prominent  in  previous  toxicity  studies  in  rats  were  periportal 
hemosiderosis in the liver, moderate or severe mineralisation of the capsule and trabecules in the spleen, severe 
dilatation of the main extra-hepatic bile duct probably induced or aggravated by a narrow duodenal orifice of the 
duct  and  accompanied  by  a  moderate  to  severe  inflammation  and  a  pronounced  hyperplasia  of  the  ductal 
epithelial  cells,  minimal  to  mild  signs  of  unspecific  tubular  injury  in  the  kidneys,  slight  to  severe 
peliosis/angiectasis  and,  only  in  males,  diffuse  hyperplasia  of  the  adrenal  cortex,  slight  to  severe  cellular 
depletion in the bone marrow, minimal to mild lymphoid depletion in the spleen, moderate involution of the 
thymus  and  reduced  size  and  sparse  vascularisation  of  corpora  lutea  (often  associated  with  an  increase  in 
number) in the ovaries.

13-week toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkey (U05-2245).  
Groups of 3 males and 3 females received doses of 0, 3, 15 or 30 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 by oral gavage. A further 
2 male and 2 female monkeys were assigned to the Control and high dose groups which were retained for a 4 
week recovery period following the 13 week treatment period. During the study, clinical condition, bodyweight, 
food  consumption,  ophthalmic  examination,  ECG,  haematology,  blood  chemistry,  toxicokinetics,  urinalysis, 
organ weight, macroscopic and microscopic pathology investigations were performed. 
Because of clinical signs of diarrhea and loose/liquid faeces in animals given 30 mg/kg/day, the high dose was 
lowered to 20 mg/kg/day after a 3-day off treatment period.  At 15 and 30/20 mg/kg/day the animals showed 
reduced body weight gain or body weight loss. Pertinent histopathological changes were decreased cellularity of 
the thymic cortex and fatty replacement of the bone marrow.  Though also present in some control animals, 
their incidence and severity were increased in treated animals and showed a dosage-related trend.  All bone 
marrow smears, however, were considered to be normal for cellularity, distribution and morphology. 
52-week toxicity study in Rhesus monkey (U07-1875) 
Groups of 4 male and 4 female Rhesus monkeys received doses of 0, 10, 20 or 60 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 by oral 
gavage for 52 weeks. Additionally 2 males and 2 females were allocated to the control and high dose groups and 
were allowed a 4-week treatment free period at the end of the study to observe recovery. As a result of adverse 
clinical signs seen in high dose animals, this group had a 20 day off-dose period following the first 4 weeks of 
treatment.  The  high  dose  was  reduced  stepwise  from  60  to  45  and  then  to  30  mg/kg/day.  Three  weeks  of 
treatment were added at the end of the study with the remaining animals from this group. 
During the study, clinical condition, bodyweight, ophthalmic examination, EGC, haematology, blood chemistry, 
toxicokinetics, urinalysis, immunology, organ weights, macropathology and histopathology investigations were 
performed. 
In the high dose group one male and one female were killed due to severe clinical signs including liquid faeces, 
vomiting,  pale  gums,  salivation,  hypoactivity,  thin  build  and  hunched  posture.  Similar  effects  were  also 
observed in the other high dose animals. Mixed coliform Spp. (particularly E. coli) and/or Campylobacter Spp. 
bacteria were detected in the rectum and/or faeces, and may have contributed to the severity of liquid faeces. 
Reduced body weight was observed in all treated groups, but only statistically significant at the two highest dose 
levels. Statistically significant reductions of large unstained cells were observed in all groups, while only at the 
top dose for basophils, erythrocytes and platelets. Blood chemistry showed elevated levels of chloride (all doses) 
and reduced levels of albumin and total protein (highest dose). Growth plate thickening in the femur, atrophy of 
adrenal  zone  fasciculata  and  reductions  in  spleen  weight  were  present  in  all  dose  groups,  while  significant 
reductions in lung and bronchi weight were seen at the highest dose only. No other effects than growth plate 
thickening  in  the  femur  was  still  present  at  the  end  of  recovery.  Electrocardiography,  ophthalmoscopy, 
urinalysis,  peripheral  blood 
leukocyte  analysis  and  macroscopic  pathology  did  not 
indicate  any 
treatment-related changes. 
In addition, two mini-pig studies were performed in order to evaluate the sensitivity of this non-rodent species 
to liver enzyme elevations induced by BIBF 1120 which have been observed in patients.

Oral exploratory 2-day toxicity study in mini-pigs (U11-1349, non-GLP) 
An oral dose of 50 mg/kg BIBF 1120 was administered on 2 consecutive days to 1 male and 1 female mini-pig. 
Slight increases in the activity of AST, ALT and GLDH and decreases in bilirubin and triglycerides on Day 2 were 
considered of no biological relevance.  
Oral 7-day toxicity study in mini-pigs (U07-2343, non-GLP) 
Oral doses of 0, 50, 70 and 100 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 were administered to a total of 3 male animals, and 0, 40, 
and 50 mg/kg/day to a total of 3 female animals. The maximum continuous administration per dose was 7 days. 
Toxicokinetic  measurements  demonstrated  substantial  exposure  (C(max)  of  538 ng/mL  and  AUC(0-24h)  of 
9010 ng·h/mL at 100 mg/kg/day in the males).  Five of 6 animals had to be sacrificed.  Despite of the severe 
clinical signs, only inconsistent increases in AST (up to 123.4 U/L) and ALT (up to 86.4 U/L) were observed at the 
end of the treatment period.  No other significant changes of liver parameters were observed (AP, gamma-GT, 
LDH, bilirubin).

Fertility and early embryonic development 
Male fertility and subsequent early embryonic development was investigated following administration of BIBF 
1120 at 0, 3, 20 and 100 mg/kg/day PO to male rats. Treatment started 92 days before mating. The females 
received treatment with vehicle only from gestation day 1 through 6. Clinical signs, food consumption, body 
weight were recorded for the parental animals. Copulation, fertility and gestation rates were recorded.  
In the treated males, loose and broken teeth were observed at 20 and 100 mg/kg (4/24 and 23/24 animals 
respectively), and decreased food consumption and bodyweight fluctuations (mid dose group) and body weight 
loss (high dose group) was observed from 20 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120. With respect to reproductive parameters, 
all males in all groups mated successfully, and copulation, fertility and gestation indices were all 100% in both 
control group as well as the treated groups. Litter parameters (resorptions, resorption rate and pre-implantation 
loss) were comparable between control and treated groups. Slight decrease in the mean number of corpora 
lutea (20 mg/kg) and slight increases in the mean numbers of total resorptions, early resorptions and resorption 
rate (all at 3 mg/kg) were within the ranges of means in the evaluation studies of Viertel et al. (2004 and 2005). 
Embryo-fœtal development 
Two studies were performed in rats to assess the effects of BIBF 1120 on embryofetal development. In the first 
study doses of 30, 75 and 180 mg/kg were used, and complete loss of embryos was observed at all dose levels. 
Another study, with lower doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day with the dosing period spanning from gestation day 
7 to 16 was performed. In this study, complete resorption of the embryos was observed at 20 mg/kg and at the 
lower doses, skeletal variations (5 and 10 mg/kg), as well as dysmorphogenesis of blood vessels (10 mg/kg) 
were observed.   
A dose range study was performed in female rabbits treated with BIBF 1120 by oral gavage with 0, 3, 7, 15, 30, 
75, 180 mg/kg/day (6 animals per group) from GD 6 to 18. Maternal toxicity was observed in the high dose 
group  (180  mg/kg/day),  1  animal  found  dead  and  2  euthanized  due  to  poor  general  condition  on  GD  15. 
Unusually  yellow  urine  was  observed  from  doses  of  75  mg/kg/day.  Embryotoxicity  was  observed  form  75 
mg/kg/day, where increased resorption rate was observed, and 2 females had complete abortions. Complete 
fetal resorption was also observed at 180 mg/kg/day. No fetal or maternal toxicity was demonstrated at 30 
mg/kg/day  or  below.  A  teratogenic  effect  was  observed  in  the  75  mg/kg/day  group.  The  results  in  this 
preliminary study support a dose proposal of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day for low-, mid- and high-dose levels in a 
subsequent pivotal embryofetal toxicity study. 
Toxicokinetics 
Blood samples for exposure and toxicokinetics were taken in most of the toxicology studies; results of AUC and 
Cmax obtained in the studies summarised in table X. For the calculation of exposure multiples, the oral dosage 
of 250 mg bid as Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD).

Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of BIBF 1120 was assessed in 5 studies, where both dermal tolerance (U05-1395), potential 
for eye irritation (U03-1151), injection either intravenous (U08-1862), intramuscular (U08-1862), intra-arterial 
(08B041)  or  paravenous  (U08-1863)  were  assessed.  In  addition  a  study  was  performed  to  assess  the 
haemolytic potential of BIBF 1120 formulated in a solution for infusion (09B032).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014

In the local tolerance studies performed BIBF 1120 was found to be well tolerated following dermal application, 
in an aqueous solution (0.5 g solubilised in water applied topically to skin of rabbits); ocular application of 20 mg 
powdered administered once in the conjunctival sac of rabbits; intravenous administration in rabbits (2 mg/mL 
in 5 % glucose). Nintedanib was found to cause local irritation following intra-arterial administration in rabbits 
(2 mg/mL in 5% glucose); paravenous administration in rats (2 mg/mL in 5% glucose); intramuscular 
administration in rabbits (2 mg/mL in 5% glucose). The haemolytic potential was found to be very low, as only 
hemolysis of up to 0.5% was observed when 2.0 mg/mL BIBF 1120 was applied. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunological investigations (phenotyping of lymphoid subpopulations in blood, spleen and thymus, as well as 
determination  of  spleen  natural  killer  cell  activity)  were  performed  in  the  4-week  toxicity  study  in  rats 
(U04-1812), in the 13-week toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys (U05-2245) and in the 52-week toxicity 
study in Rhesus monkeys (U07-1875).   
In male rats of the 4-week toxicity study (U04-1812), a decreased T- to B-lymphocyte ratio in the peripheral 
blood and spleen of all animals given the high dose level of 100 mg/kg/day, an approximate 30% decrease in 
T-helper cells (CD3+CD4+) of the blood and a slight increase in natural-killer cell activity in the spleen were 
observed.   
In the 13-week toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys (U05-2245), no changes of CD4 and CD8 positive T cells 
and NK cells were observed.  In peripheral blood, a mild reduction of B cells was noted in study week 13.  No 
changes were present at the end of the recovery period. 
In  the  52-week  toxicity  study  in  Rhesus  monkeys  (U07-1875),  no  consistent  changes  of  peripheral  blood 
monocytes, B and T cell subsets and NK cells were observed.  There were also no changes in the percentages of 
splenic B and T cell subsets and NK cells and no statistically significant changes in NK cell function.  In animals 
at 60/45/30 mg/kg/day, however, there was evidence of a decrease in the absolute numbers of all cell types per 
gram of spleen tissue.  No changes of any parameter including NK cell function were present at the end of the 
recovery period. 
Metabolites 
The major human metabolite is BIBF 1202 (free acid) and BIBF 1202 glucuronide, contributing up to 32 and 47% 
of total radioactivity following 100 mg BIBF 1120. Toxicokinetic analyses have revealed substantial systemic 
exposure to BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 glucuronide in the general toxicity studies. However, due to low formation 
of BIBF 1202 in the in vitro genotoxicity studies with BIBF 1120, BIBF 1202 was tested separately in the in vitro 
genotoxicity assays (see table below).

Impurities 
A number of potential impurities were identified, classified and genotoxic investigations performed where 
specified according to alerts and classification. Genotoxic impurities which might be present in DS were always 
below 3 ppm corresponding to the TTC of 1.5 µg/day at a maximum daily dose of 250 mg bid of BIBF 1120. 
Therefore, none of these genotoxic impurities have been specified. 
The impurity CDBB 213 is an intermediate of chemical synthesis and potential degradant of BIBF 1120. It has an 
aromatic amine moiety, which is in general a structural alert for mutagenicity. It may be formed under acidic 
conditions. In the case of delayed gastric emptying, soft gelatine capsules with BIBF 1120 may stay in the acidic 
milieu of the stomach for up to 7-8 hours. Based on in vitro data, it is estimated that this may result in a 
maximum degradation of BIBF 1120 to CDBB 213 of approximately 3%. Assuming a maximum daily dose of 
250 mg bid of BIBF 1120, this percentage of degradation would result in an exposure of maximally 
~0.3 mg/kg/day or ~1.15 µmol/kg/day of CDBB 213 in human patients. 
CDBB 213 was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation test, the Ames test, but showed clastogenic effects at 
very high concentrations in the 24h-incubation experiment in the mouse lymphoma assay.  CDBB 213 was 
negative withj respect to genotoxicity endpoints in a 2-week rat toxicity study, where bone marrow 
micronucleus assay and the Comet assay for the detection of DNA damage in the liver, were assessed. A NOAEL 
of 1 mg/kg/day was established for CCBB 213 in the 14 day repeat dose toxicity study performed. 
Phototoxicity 
In accordance with the OECD Guideline 432, a phototoxicity assay was conducted with Balb/c 3T3 cells 
(U05-2272).  A phototoxic threshold concentration of approximately 0.5 µg/mL was estimated.  At this 
concentration, the Photo Effect (PEC) was around the phototoxicity limit of 0.15. A Photo Irritating Factor (PIF) 
of 18.4 and a Mean Photo Effect (MPE) of 0.554 and 0.560 indicate that BIBF 1120 may have a phototoxic 
potential. 
Repeat dose toxicity studies with other agents 
Several repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted with BIBF 1120 in combination with other compounds. 
Combination partners were the EGFR/HER-2 inhibitor afatinib (U06-1624, U06-1606, U06-1196, U06-1605), 
the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib (08B038, 08B079) and an Aurora B-inhibitor, BI 811283 (U11-2658, U12-1780). 
The development of BI 811283 was terminated. The combination studies with afatinib were already included in 
the submission package for afatinib [cf. Toxicology Written Summary U12-1533).

In summary, combination of BIBF 1120 with afatinib, volasertib and an Aurora B-inhibitor did not reveal any 
additional,  toxicologically  meaningful  information  with  respect  to  the  toxicological  profile  of  BIBF 1120  not 
already known from the non-clinical studies with this compound alone.

Considering the above data, nindetanib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.   
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Tumour angiogenesis is an essential feature contributing to tumour growth, progression and metastasis 
formation and is predominantly triggered by the release of pro-angiogenic factors secreted by the tumour cell 
(i.e. VEGF and bFGF) to attract host endothelial as well as perivascular cells to facilitate oxygen and nutrient 
supply through the host vascular system.  
Nintedanib was tested for its ability to interfere with essential angiogenic processes in a variety of in vitro assays 
and in vivo systems. To evaluate the potential for combination treatment, nintedanib was tested together with 
docetaxel, vinorelbine, pemetrexed or carboplatin in xenograft models of lung and ovarian cancer.   
In preclinical disease models nintedanib, as single agent, effectively interfered with the formation and 
maintenance of the tumour vascular system resulting in tumour growth inhibition and tumour stasis. In 
particular, treatment of tumour xenografts with nintedanib led to a rapid reduction in tumour micro vessel 
density, pericytes vessel coverage and tumour perfusion (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). Affinities for various 
receptors were determined by radioligand receptor assays for BIBF 1120 at 5 μM. Potent and selective inhibition 
of human VEGF-2-dependent endothelial cell proliferation (HUVEC and HSMEC) by BIBF 1120 was demonstrated 
at IC50 values of 21 nM. VEGFR-1 was also significantly inhibited by BIBF 1120 (IC50 of 34 nM). The values 
presented for HUVEC (bFGF; 290 ± 160) and for VEGFR-3 (13) seems to be different from the data presented in 
the original study report U02-1109 (341 ± 112 nM and 46 ± 9 nM (Table 2.1.2:1 Pharmacology Written 
CHMP assessment report

Summary, respectively). In addition, in Study U02-1310 BIBF 1120 was found to inhibit VEGFR3, PDGFRα and 
FGFR-l at mean IC50 values of 13, 59 and 69 nM respectively. Therefore the Applicant is asked to: A) Present the 
correct data for HUVEC and VEGFR-3 or explain why this discrepancy exists.  B) The IC50 value for VEGFR-3 in 
this study differs from the value found in study U02-1109 and the Applicant is asked to elaborate on this 
discrepancy. 
BIBF 1120 exhibited a strong VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity in vitro. In a HUVEC proliferation assay was 
demonstrated that a short pulse (2 hrs) of BIBF 1120 treatment followed by an (up to) 46 hrs "washout" period 
was sufficient to block cell proliferation. BIBF 1202 was found to be a potent inhibitor of VEGFR-2 (IC50 = 62 nM) 
and is equally active (IC50 = 14.5 nM) on the closely related VEGFR-3. The more distantly related members of 
the kinase-insert domain family, FGFR1 and PDGFRα, were inhibited at higher concentrations (IC50 = 240 and 
433 nM, respectively). BIBF 1120 inhibited cellular proliferation of VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells derived 
from umbilical veins (HUVEC), of PDGF-BB-stimulated human vascular smooth muscle cells (HUASMC) and of 
PDGF-BB-stimulated bovine retinal pericytes (BRP) with EC50s of 9 nM, 43 nM and 79 nM (mean values), 
respectively. These proliferative effects were preceded by inhibition of MAPK and Akt phosphorylation. Induction 
of apoptosis was observed in endothelial and smooth muscle cells, but not in pericytes. The expected binding 
mode of BIBF 1120 was confirmed by co-crystallization with recombinant VEGFR-2 kinase and X-ray diffraction 
at a resolution of 2.1 Å. 
Therefore, nintedanib is a triple angiokinase inhibitor blocking vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 
(VEGFR 1-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR α and ß) and fibroblast growth factor receptors 
(FGFR 1-3) kinase activity. Nintedanib binds competitively to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket 
of these receptors and blocks the intracellular signaling which is crucial for the proliferation and survival of 
endothelial as well as perivascular cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells). In addition Fms-like 
tyrosine-protein kinase (Flt)-3, Lymphocyte-specific tyrosine-protein kinase (Lck) and proto-oncogene 
tyrosine-protein kinase src (Src) are inhibited (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
BIBF1120 at a dose level of 50 mg/kg twice daily, or 100 mg/kg once daily PO show anti-tumour efficacy in 
mouse and rat tumour xenograft models with a reduction in tumour vessel density of approximately 80% in 
Caki-1 tumours in nude mice. The Cmax plasma levels of BIBF 1120 was determined in mice following PO 100 
mg/kg PO, and in Fischer 344 rats at 50 mg/kg PO to be approximately 700 and 200 nM respectively. 
Treatment with the metabolite BIBF 1202 at a daily dose of 30 mg/kg given IP to FaDu Xenograft-implanted 
nude mice showed no significant anti-tumour effect. 
BIBF 1120 in combination with pemetrexed or carboplatin showed additive anti-tumour effects in Calu-6 and 
SKOV-3 xenografted tumours in nude mice, without showing additional adverse effects (as measured by body 
weight changes). 
The secondary pharmacodynamics of BIBF 1120 was determined in an array of studies where effects of 
treatment with BIBF 1120 by oral gavage at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg in most in vivo studies, except the mouse 
CNS study where doses of 50, 100 and 300 mg/kg, was examined with respect to CNS (general behaviour, body 
temperature and locomotor activity in mice); Cardiovascular effects (hERG assay in HEK293 cells and action 
potential configuration in isolated guinea pig papillary muscle cells, as well as in vivo studies in conscious rats 
and anaesthetized domestic pigs); Gastrointestinal effects, including gastric emptying, output, pH and volume 
and gastrointestinal transit (in rats); Hepatic and renal function.  No relevant effects were shown. The results of 
the hepatic function assay were therefore not predictive for the hepatotoxic effects of high dosages of BIBF 1120 
observed in the clinic (See Discussion on Clinical Safety). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 43/138 
  
  
 
 
In the core safety pharmacology studies, no significant effects of BIBF 1120 treatment was observed on 
respiratory parameters or in general behaviour, body temperature and locomotor activity in rats. Similarly, with 
respect to cardiovascular parameters, only slight and transient increased heart rate was observed in the high 
dose group 1 and 2 hours after dosing on Day 1 (5.7% increase compared to control group), and a slight 
tendency to decreased mean systolic pressure in the high-dose males and females on Day 1, 2 hours after 
dosing resulting from the slightly reduced individual values of 2 males and 3 females.  
The lack of any specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is acceptable. The Applicant has investigated 
ant-tumour efficacy of drug combinations and presented the data in earlier sections. 
Pharmacokinetic in vitro and in vivo studies describing the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of 
BIBF 1120 in the nonclinical species used, as well as in vitro metabolism data from human hepatocytes. 
Pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies on the major metabolites BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 glucuronide was 
also performed. 
In vitro studies of BIBF 1120 absorption in cells showed that permeability through bio-membranes was high, 
e.g. within minutes, the BIBF 1120 radioactivity was associated with the cell fraction in the test system, both at 
37˚C and 4˚C the transport process was most likely passive.  
Bioavailability was low in humans (4.7%) as well as the non clinical species approximately 11% (rat) to 23.8% 
(rhesus monkey). High metabolism Intestinal P-gp activity was suspected to contribute to the low bioavailability 
due to incomplete absorption form the intestinal tract. In addition, first pass metabolism in the liver and 
intestine further contribute to the low bioavailability observed. 
The plasma protein binding of BIBF 1120 was high in mice, rats and humans, at 97% to 98.5%, and slightly 
lower in the non-human primates Rhesus and Cynomolgus monkeys (91% to 93%). Tissue distribution studies 
showed that the high binding to plasma protein did not restrict BIBF 1120 to the vascular compartment, but 
rather rapid and extensive distribution of BIBF 1120 was apparent in rat tissues at 5 minutes after IV 
administration. Repeated oral dosing (30 mg/kg [14C]BIBF 1120) for 13 days showed a slight accumulation in 
some tissues (testes, salivary gland, epididymides and liver), albeit a similar accumulation in plasma 
concentrations was not apparent.  
Placental transfer of BIBF 1120 was not examined, although maternal exposure was determined in embryo-fetal 
development studies, no exposure data was generated for the foetuses, and no conclusions on the possible 
placental transfer can be made. Excretion of BIBF 1120 into milk was examined in female Wistar rats on Day 12 
of lactation, and the average concentration at 1 hour after dosing was approximately 10-fold lower than the 
plasma concentration (269 and 2260 ng/mL respectively). The total estimated BIBF 1120 radioactivity secreted 
to milk over a 24 hour period was 0.18-0.5%. In rats, small amounts of radiolabelled nintedanib and/or its 
metabolites were excreted into the milk  (≤ 0.5 % of the administered dose) (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
BIBF 1120 showed high clearance in all species. Metabolic elimination was the major clearance pathway, with 
m1 (BIBF 1202) as the primary metabolite excreted via in faeces in all species. Approximately 10 to 30 % of the 
orally administered BIBF 1120 was recovered unchanged in the faeces of the nonclinical species, and 
approximately 20 % was recovered in human faeces. In the tabularised presentation of the major metabolites 
in plasma (as % of sample radioactivity), the metabolite M7 is listed to represent 11.6%. The remaining 
metabolites following oral administration of BIBF 1120 was present in smaller amounts less than 10% for most 
except in mice, where m3 and m4 was present at approximately 10 and 20 % respectively. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 44/138 
  
  
 
 
The major route of excretion of BIBF 1120 following IV dose is faecal and biliary with approximately 5% of the 
dose being excreted via urine. Following PO dose, faecal excretion is higher in the rat, but similar in the Rhesus 
monkey, and urinary excretion decreases to approximately 1.5 % in the nonclinical species. Biliary excretion is 
higher following IV administration than PO administration, indicating together with the lower urinary excretion 
that absorption from the intestinal tract following PO administration is incomplete. 
Dose-dependent inhibition of OCT1 by BIBF 1120 was demonstrated, but not of other hepatic transporters 
tested. The IC50 value of BIBF 1120 for OCT1 was estimated to be 0.88 μM i.e. 12.4-fold higher than the 
maximum plasma concentration of BIBF 1120 (37.9 ng/mL: 0.071 μM) after 200 mg oral administration to 
humans. Therefore, potent inhibition of OCT1 by BIBF 1120 under in vivo conditions is considered unlikely.  
Efflux transport studies suggest involvement of P-gp in the biliary and urinary excretion of BIBF 1120, while 
P-gp, MRP2 and BCRP appear to have little role in the biliary and urinary excretion of BIBF 1202.  
BIBF 1202 glucuronide is a substrate of BCRP and MRP2, but not of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1 and OCT1. 
Transport of BIBF 1202 glucoronide by P-gp was not performed due to experimental limitations.  
[14C]BIBW 2992 MA2 was metabolized under formation of U1 (BIBW 2992 MA2 N-oxide) and U2 (N-desmethyl 
BIBW 2992 MA2). BIBF 1120 ES up to a concentration of 50 μM had no apparent effect on the in vitro microsomal 
metabolism of [14C]BIBW 2992 MA2, neither on metabolite formation nor on the metabolic depletion of 
[14C]BIBW 2992 MA2. 
[14C]BIBF 1120 ES was metabolized under formation of U1 (di-demethyl BIBF 1120 ES), U2 (BIBF 1202, i.e. 
O-demethyl BIBF 1120 ES) and U4 (BIBF 1053, i.e. N-demethyl BIBF 1120 ES). BIBW 2992 MA2 up to a 
concentration of 50 μM had some minor inhibitory effect on the formation of U1, U2 and U4 and consequently 
reduced the metabolic turnover of BIBF 1120 ES. However, the effect was only minor and an IC50 could not be 
calculated as the inhibition was < 50 % at the highest concentration of BIBW 2992 MA2 (50 μM). 
An extensive toxicology program has been performed in rodents and non-rodents. For the selection of the most 
relevant non-rodent species for long-term toxicity studies, dogs, mini-pigs, Cynomolgus monkeys and Rhesus 
monkeys were considered. The dog was identified as the most sensitive, however, not considered most relevant 
due to severe gastro-intestinal effects, since the severe gastrointestinal effects were considered to prevent this 
species from attaining sufficient long-term exposure necessary to detect potential chronic effects of BIBF 1120 
on other organ systems than the GI tract. Further, dogs were determined not to be a suitable species to 
investigate the liver enzyme elevations observed in patients, since only moderate increases in transaminase 
activities were observed. These elevations were seen when the dogs were moribund due to the severe adverse 
gastrointestinal effects (diarrhoea and vomiting). The mini-pig was also considered not to be an appropriate 
species to study liver enzyme elevations observed in the clinical setting, as this specie showed severe clinical 
signs, but only slight and inconsistent increases in AST and ALT at the end of the treatment period. The 
Cynomolgus and Rhesus monkey also showed gastro-intestinal effects, although not to the same degree as the 
dog, and was therefore chosen as the non-rodent species most relevant for the toxicology program. 
The single dose of 40 mg/kg BIBF 1120 IV or 2000 mg/kg orally was well tolerated in mice and rats. In rats 
treated with 2000 mg/kg orally general, nonspecific, signs of toxicity were observed on the first day of 
treatment, e.g. sedation, staggering gait and diarrhoea, but the signs subsided and all animals proceeded to 
planned necropsy. No changes were observed at gross pathology of the animals. No single dose studies were 
performed in non-rodents. This is acceptable according to ICH guideline M3(R2), acute toxicity information from 
two mammalian species dosed both via the clinical route and a parenteral (in this case IV) route.

The toxicity profile of BIBF 1120 was explored in both mice (up to 13 weeks) and rats (up to 26 weeks). In the 
long-term studies LOAEL (mouse) and NOAEL (rat) of <10 and 5 mg/kg/day were found. The most prominent 
treatment related findings which were considered to be related to the pharmacodynamic activity of BIBF 1120 as 
a VEGFR-2 inhibitor was: dentopathies of the continuously growing incisors which in turn contributed to the 
lower body weight and body weight gains observed, the thickening of the growth plates in long bones, , 
PAS-positive hyaline intracytoplasmic granules in podocytes and glomerular endothelium of the glomeruli of the 
kidneys and the reduced size/increased number of corpora lutea and presence of luteinized follicles in the 
ovaries and lastly cellular depletion of the bone marrow which may be related to the various roles VEGF has in 
hematopoiesis.  
Single dose toxicity studies in rats and mice indicated a low acute toxic potential of nintedanib. In repeat dose 
toxicology studies in rats, adverse effects (e.g. thickening of epiphyseal plates, lesions of the incisors) were 
mostly related to the mechanism of action (i.e. VEGFR-2 inhibition) of nintedanib. These changes are known 
from other VEGFR-2 inhibitors and can be considered class effects (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
In Cynomolgus monkeys, 13 weeks treatment with BIBF 1120 by oral gavage at doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day 
revealed treatment-related changes with a dosage-related trend: 30 mg/kg/day was not tolerated; 3 
mg/kg/day was well tolerated clinically but resulted in histopathological changes of the thymus and bone 
marrow. Evidence of recovery was seen in animals which had received 30/20 mg/kg/day after 4 weeks without 
treatment. NOAEL was not established in this study. BIBF 1120 administered by oral gavage to Rhesus monkeys 
for 52 weeks at 60/45/30 mg/kg/day caused treatment-related liquid faeces, vomiting and bodyweight loss. The 
presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract may have exacerbated the severity of 
liquid faeces and led to the premature death of two high dose animals. Reduced bodyweight gains were 
observed in animals receiving 20 mg/kg/day which were considered adverse. Histopathologically, growth plate 
thickening in the femur/tibia and sternum, that was pharmacologically mediated, was seen at all dose levels. All 
treatment-related changes showed complete or partial reversibility. Changes seen at the 10 mg/kg/day dose 
level were either slight (i.e., not considered adverse), of unknown relationship to treatment, or were 
pharmacologically mediated, and as such this dosage level was considered to be the NOAEL. 
Diarrhoea and vomiting accompanied by reduced food consumption and loss of body weight were observed in 
toxicity studies in non-rodents. 
There was no evidence of liver enzyme increases in rats, dogs, and Cynomolgus monkeys. Mild liver enzyme 
increases, which were not due to serious adverse effects such as diarrhoea were only observed in Rhesus 
monkeys.  
Toxicokinetic and pharmacokinetic data confirm that the non-clinical species were exposed at or above expected 
therapeutic levels with regards to BIBF 1120 as well as the main metabolites BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 
glucuronide. AUC is considered to be the most appropriate parameter since non-clinical toxicity mainly was seen 
upon repeated administration. In the toxicology studies, the observed NOAEL’s give rise to low exposure 
multitudes close to or below 1. This is acceptable in the context of the proposed indication of second line 
treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. For the calculation of exposure multiples, the oral dosage of 
250 mg bid as Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD).  However, for the current application 200 mg bid 
is specified as the MRHD in the SmPC. The dose-normalized geometric mean AUC(0-12h,ss) of BIBF 1120 in 
advanced cancer patients was 1.21 ng*h/mL (U11-1639).  Thus a geometric mean daily exposure of twice the 
AUC(0-12h,ss), i.e. 605 ng*h/mL, can be assumed in humans.

The genotoxic potential of BIBF 1120 was assessed by three studies. An determining the potential of BIBF 1120 
to cause gene mutations in bacteria, a study assessing the frequency of gene mutations in mammalian cells (), 
and an in vivo study in rats assessing micronuclei in bone marrow cells, indicative of the potential of BIBF 1120 
to cause chromosomal aberrations. BIBF 1120  
Genotoxicity studies indicated no mutagenic potential for nintedanib.According to the ICH S9 carcinogenicity 
studies are not warranted in the context of the proposed indication for ( second line and in combination with 
docetaxel). 
The submitted studies on reproductive toxicity are considered adequate. Based on preclinical investigations 
there is no evidence for impairment of male fertility (see section 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC). There are no human 
or animal data on potential effects of nintedanib on female fertility available. 
A study of male fertility and early embryonic development to implantation in rats did not reveal effects on the 
male reproductive tract and male fertility following oral treatment with BIBF 1120 at 3, 20 and 100 mg/kg. 
However, slight effects on the early embryonic development, e.g. slightly decreased number of corpora lutea 
and slight increases in the mean numbers of total resorptions, early resorptions and resorption rate (all at 3 
mg/kg). These observed differences between the treated groups and the control group were however within the 
ranges of means in the evaluation studies of Viertel et al. (2004 and 2005). 
In rats, embryo-foetal lethality and teratogenic effects were observed at exposure levels below human 
exposure, at the MRHD of 250 mg twice daily (b.i.d.). Effects on the development of the axial skeleton and on 
the development of the great arteries were also noted at subtherapeutic exposure levels. The studies performed 
to assess embryo-fetal development in rats, showed that BIBF 1120 at doses exceeding 20 mg/kg resulted in 
complete resorption of the embryos. At lower doses skeletal variations (from 5 mg/kg) and dysmorphogenesis 
of blood vessels (10 mg/kg) were observed. The embryotoxicity observed is not surprising, as BIBF 1120 inhibits 
angiogenesis. The dose range finding study performed in rabbits showed embryo-fetal lethality and teratogenic 
effects from 75 mg/kg/day (Day 1 Cmax 498 ng/mL and AUC0-24 2290 ng*h/mL).  
In rabbits, embryo-foetal lethality was observed at an exposure approximately 8 times higher than at the 
MHRD. Teratogenic effects on the aortic arches in combination with the heart and the urogenital system were 
noted at an exposure 4 times higher than at the MRHD and on the embryo-fetal development of the axial 
skeleton at an exposure 3 times higher than at the MRHD. 
The SmPC text sufficiently describes the observed embryo toxicity in sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3, and women and 
men of childbearing potential are advised to use adequate contraception. 
Nintedanib may cause foetal harm in humans (see section 5.3). Women of childbearing potential being treated 
with Vargatef should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with Vargatef and to use 
adequate contraception during and at least 3 months after the last dose of Vargatef. Since the effect of 
nintedanib on the metabolism and efficacy of contraceptives has not been investigated, barrier methods should 
be applied as a second form of contraception, to avoid pregnancy. 
There is no information on the use of Vargatef in pregnant women, but pre-clinical studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity of this active substance (see section 5.3). As nintedanib may cause foetal harm also 
in humans, it should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition requires treatment. Pregnancy 
testing should be conducted at least prior to treatment with Vargatef. 
Female patients should be advised to notify their doctor or pharmacist if they become pregnant during therapy 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014

with Vargatef. If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving Vargatef, she should be apprised of the potential 
hazard to the foetus. Termination of the treatment with Vargatef should be considered. 
There is no information on the excretion of nintedanib and its metabolites in human milk.  
Pre-clinical studies showed that small amounts of nintedanib and its metabolites (≤ 0.5 % of the administered 
dose) were secreted into milk of lactating rats. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Vargatef.  
Nintedanib is presented as an oral formulation. The potential for local irritation can be assessed as part of other 
toxicity tests, and as the intended route of administration (oral gelatine capsules), the local effects on the GI 
canal can be considered adequately addressed in the repeat dose studies. In the 5 local tolerance studies and 
the study on haemolytic potential of BIBF 1120 showed that BIBF 1120 was well tolerated following dermal 
application in aqueous solution, ocular application in the conjunctival sac and following intravenous 
administration (5% glucose) in rabbits. Whereas, on the other hand BIBF 1120 was causing local irritation 
following intra-arterial, intra muscular and paravenous administration in 5% glucose. 
Immunological investigations were performed on the 4-week repeat dose toxicity study in rats, in the 13-week 
toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkey and in the 52-week study in Rhesus monkeys. No consistent adverse 
effects on the immune system of the nonclinical species were observed. Similarly, no signs of 
immunosuppresion were observed in these studies. 
The metabolite BIBF 1202 is negative in genotoxicity studies in vitro. No in vivo studies have been performed. 
However, toxicokinetic data indicate substantial exposure to BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 glucuronide following 
dosing with BIBF 1120. Therefore, no further toxicity studies with BIBF 1202 or BIBF 1202 glucuronide is 
required. 
The impurity CDBB 213, an intermediate of chemical synthesis and potential degradant of BIBF 1120 was 
negative in the bacterial reverse mutation test, the Ames test, and in a 2-week rat toxicity study, where bone 
marrow micronucleus assay and the Comet assay for the detection of DNA damage in the liver, but showed 
clastogenic effects at very high concentrations in the 24h-incubation experiment in the mouse lymphoma assay.  
A NOAEL of 1 mg/kg/day was established for CCBB 213 in the 14 day repeat dose toxicity study performed. 
The OECD Guideline 432 specifies that; a PIF value > 5, and a MPE value >0.15 predicts phototoxicity. 
Consequently, the 3T3 NRU test indicates that nintedanib is phototoxic. However, as no phototoxic potential has 
been seen in existing human data, the positive in vitro finding is considered to be of low clinical relevance. 
Nintedanib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. However, as a precautionary measure the 
Applicant has included the statement: “Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. 
Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the 
environment” in the PL. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical documentation submitted was considered adequate. The relevant information has been 
included in the SmPC (sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3).

2.4.   Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
Table 9 Clinical trials investigating nintedanib in patients with NSLC 
Based on the overall safety profile from all phase I and phase II studies, a nintedanib dose of 200 mg b.i.d. 
administered approximately 12  hours apart, on days 2  to 21  of a standard 21-day docetaxel treatment cycle, 
was selected for the combination with standard therapy of docetaxel (75mg/m2) in the phase III trial 1199.13. 
This starting dose could be reduced in two steps in case of intolerable AEs. If a dose of nintedanib is missed, 
administration should resume at the next scheduled time at the recommended dose. The individual daily doses 
of nintedanib should not be increased beyond the recommended dose to make-up for missed doses and the 
recommended maximum daily dose of 400 mg should not be exceeded (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Patients may continue therapy with nintedanib after discontinuation of docetaxel for as long as clinical benefit is 
observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Nintedanib reached maximum plasma concentrations approximately 2 - 4 hours after oral administration as soft 
gelatin capsule under fed conditions (range 0.5 - 8 hours).  
Results of the absolute bioavailability analysis in healthy volunteers for AUC0-∞ and AUC0-tz are presented below:

Absorption and bioavailability are decreased by transporter effects and substantial first-pass metabolism. Dose 
proportionality was shown by increase of nintedanib exposure (dose range 50 - 450 mg once daily and 150 - 300 
mg twice daily). Steady state plasma concentrations were achieved within one week of dosing at the latest. 
The effect of food on exposure to nintedanib was investigated in study 1199.17. In a single-dose open study of 
16 male volunteers, the effect of a high fat meal (as administered 30 minutes before drug administration) on a 
single 150mg of nintedanib was investigated (see Table 10). 
Table 10: Geometric mean (and gCV%) pharmacokinetic parameters of BIBF 1120 BS after single oral 
administration of 150 mg nintedanib capsule under fasted and fed conditions to healthy male volunteers 
After food intake, nintedanib exposure increased by approximately 20 % compared to administration under 
fasted conditions (CI: 95.3 - 152.5 %) and absorption was delayed (median t max fasted: 2.00 hours; fed: 3.98 
h) (see SmPC section 5.2).

EMA/CHMP/726072/2014

Distribution 
Nintedanib follows at least bi-phasic disposition kinetics. After intravenous infusion, a high volume of 
distribution during the terminal phase (Vz: 1050 L, 45.0 % gCV) was observed. 
The in vitro protein binding of nintedanib in human plasma was high, with a bound fraction of 97.8 %. Serum 
albumin is considered to be the major binding protein. Nintedanib is preferentially distributed in plasma with a 
blood to plasma ratio of 0.869 (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Elimination 
The prevalent metabolic reaction for nintedanib is hydrolytic cleavage by esterases resulting in the free acid 
moiety BIBF 1202. BIBF 1202 is subsequently glucuronidated by UGT enzymes, namely UGT 1A1, UGT 1A7, UGT 
1A8, and UGT 1A10 to BIBF 1202 glucuronide.  
Only a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP pathways with CYP 3A4 being the 
predominant enzyme involved. The major CYP-dependent metabolite could not be detected in plasma in the 
human ADME study. In vitro, CYP-dependent metabolism accounted for about 5 % compared to about 25 % 
ester cleavage. 
In preclinical in vivo experiments, BIBF 1202 did not show efficacy despite its activity at target receptors of the 
substance. 
Total plasma clearance after intravenous infusion was high (CL: 1390 mL/min, 28.8 % gCV). Urinary excretion 
of the unchanged active substance within 48 h was about 0.05 % of the dose (31.5 % gCV) after oral and about 
1.4 % of dose (24.2 % gCV) after intravenous administration; the renal clearance was 20 mL/min (32.6 % gCV). 
The major route of elimination of drug related radioactivity after oral administration of [14C] nintedanib was via 
faecal/biliary excretion (93.4 % of dose, 2.61 % gCV). 
The contribution of renal excretion to the total clearance was low (0.649 % of dose, 26.3 % gCV). 
The overall recovery was considered complete (above 90 %) within 4 days after dosing. The terminal half-life of 
nintedanib was between 10 and 15 h (gCV % approximately 50 %) (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Nintedanib showed dose proportionality for all investigated PK parameters. CL/F of nintedanib did not change 
after multiple dosing compared to single administration. The PK of nintedanib can therefore be considered linear 
with respect to time (i.e. single-dose data can be extrapolated to multiple-dose data). Accumulation upon 
multiple administrations was 1.04-fold for Cmax and 1.38-fold for AUCτ. Nintedanib trough concentrations 
remained stable for more than one year (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetic properties of nintedanib were similar in healthy volunteers, cancer patients, and patients 
of the target population. Exposure to nintedanib was not influenced by gender (body weight corrected), mild and 
moderate renal impairment (estimated by creatinine clearance), liver metastases, ECOG performance score, 
alcohol consumption, and P-gp genotype. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 51/138 
  
  
 
 
Population PK analyses indicated moderate effects on exposure to nintedanib depending on the following 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Based on the high inter-individual variability of exposure observed in the clinical 
LUME-Lung-1 trial these effects are not considered clinically relevant. However, close monitoring is 
recommended in patients with several of these risk factors (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Nintedanib  is  predominantly  eliminated  via  biliary/faecal  excretion  (>  90  %,  see  elimination).  The  safety, 
efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of nintedanib have not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment 
classified as Child Pugh B and C (moderate and severe hepatic impairment respectively). Therefore, treatment 
of patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment with nintedanib is not recommended.  
Hepatic impairment and its potential effects on the PK of nintedanib were explored in several analyses based on 
transaminase and bilirubin levels. These included the Phase II/III PopPK, studies 1199.3 and 1199.19, and the 
two  exploratory  PopPK  analyses.  Pharmocokinetic  data  for  nintedanib  was  collected  in  patients  with 
abnormalities in hepatic parameters defined by elevations in AST, ALT and bilirubin levels. A trend to elevated 
exposure was observed in patients with AST- and ALT-values (up to 10 x ULN) and elevated bilirubin levels (up 
to 1.5 x ULN) at baseline as compared to patients with normal AST, ALT and bilirubin levels. In patients with ALT 
or AST > 10 x ULN and bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN, data were too limited to draw conclusions (see SmPC section 5.2).  
Renal impairment 
No dedicated study in renally impaired patients has been performed. The contribution of renal excretion after 
oral  administration  of  nintedanib  both  as  unchanged  drug  (about  0.05%  of  dose)  and  as  drug  related 
radioactivity was minor (about 0.6% of dose). As a consequence, adjustment of the starting dose in patients 
with mild to moderate renal impairment is not required. 
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of nintedanib have not been studied in patients with severe renal 
impairment  (<30  ml/min  creatinine  clearance).  Treatment  of  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  is  not 
recommended.  
Gender, ethnicity, body weight, age 
No formal studies were conducted to examine gender, ethnicity, weight or age.  
In  the  Phase  II/III  PopPK  analysis  age,  race  and  body  weight  were  found  to  affect  the  PK  of  nintedanib. 
Simulations  revealed  that  none  of  the  individual  covariate  effects  alone  identified  in  the  Phase  II/III  PopPK 
analysis  caused  a  change  in  exposure  that  exceeded  the  observed  variability  range  of  nintedanib.  Relevant 
increases in simulated exposure were only found when considering more than one covariate.  
Exposure to nintedanib increased linearly with age. AUCτ,ss decreased by 16 % for a 45-year old patient (5th 
percentile)  and  increased  by  13 %  for  a  76-year  old  patient  (95th  percentile)  relative  to  a  patient  with  the 
median age of 62 years. The age range covered by the analysis was 29 to 85 years representing approximately 
5 % of the population were older than 75 years. Studies in paediatric populations have not been performed. 
The number of elderly patients included in PK trials is reported in the table below.

An inverse correlation between body weight and exposure to nintedanib was observed. AUCτ,ss increased by 25 
% for a 50 kg patient (5th percentile) and decreased by 19 % for a 100 kg  patient (95th percentile) relative to 
a patient with the median weight of 71.5 kg. 
The geometric mean exposure to nintedanib was 33 % higher in Chinese, Taiwanese, and Indian patients while 
it was 22 % lower in Koreans compared to Caucasians (body weight corrected). However, based on the high 
inter-individual  variability  of  exposure  these  effects  are  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  Data  from  black 
individuals was very limited but in the same range as for Caucasians (see SmPC section 5.2). 
No studies in paediatric populations investigating the PK of nintedanib have been performed. Safety data for 
Black and African American patients are limited (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Two well-designed conducted and reported DDI studies in healthy volunteers have been performed to assess the 
clinical relevance of potent P-GP inhibition and induction on the PK of nintedanib.  
Co-administration with the potent P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole increased exposure to nintedanib 1.61-fold based 
on AUC and 1.83-fold based on Cmax in a dedicated drug-drug interaction study. In a drug-drug interaction 
study with the potent P-gp inducer rifampicin, exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3 % based on AUC and 
to 60.3 % based on Cmax upon co-administration with rifampicin compared to administration of nintedanib alone. 
If co-administered with nintedanib, potent P gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole or erythromycin) may increase 
exposure  to  nintedanib.  In  such  cases,  patients  should  be  monitored  closely  for  tolerability  of  nintedanib. 
Management  of  side  effects  may  require  interruption,  dose  reduction,  or  discontinuation  of  therapy  with 
nintedanib. 
Potent P-gp inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort) may decrease exposure 
to nintedanib. Co-administration with Vargatef should be carefully considered. 
Co-administration  of  nintedanib  with  docetaxel  (75  mg/m²)  did  not  alter  the  pharmacokinetics  of  either 
medicine to a relevant extent. 
The potential for interactions of nintedanib with hormonal contraceptives was not explored (see SmPC section 
4.5). 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Inhibition of glucuronidation reactions by nintedanib and BIBF 1202 was investigated in vitro using human liver 
microsomes or expressed UGT enzymes [U06-1744]. The IC50 for UGT 1A1 dependent ß-estradiol metabolism 
was  24.5  µM  for  nintedanib  and  >200  µM  for  BIBF  1202.  UGT  2B7  dependent  ß-estradiol  metabolism  was 
inhibited by nintedanib with an IC50 of 77.6 µM and an IC50 >200 µM for BIBF 1202. 
Results of transporter inhibition experiments are reported in the table below.

The in vitro evaluation of the drug drug interaction (DDI) potential for nintedanib and its metabolites, the free 
acid moiety BIBF 1202 and its glucuronide BIBF 1202 glucuronide does not suggest a clinically relevant potential 
for nintedanib mediated DDI related to, P450 enzymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 4A11. 
Only a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP pathways. The likelihood of 
drug-drug interactions with nintedanib based on CYP metabolism is therefore considered to be low (see SmPC 
section 4.5). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Nintedanib is a triple angiokinase inhibitor blocking vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR 1-3), 
platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptors  (PDGFR α and ß)  and  fibroblast  growth  factor  receptors  (FGFR 1-3) 
kinase  activity.  Nintedanib  binds  competitively  to  the  adenosine  triphosphate (ATP)  binding  pocket  of  these 
receptors and blocks the intracellular signaling which is crucial for the proliferation and survival of endothelial as 
well as perivascular cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells). In addition Fms-like tyrosine-protein 
kinase (Flt)-3, Lymphocyte-specific tyrosine-protein kinase (Lck) and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase 
src (Src) are inhibited. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Tumour angiogenesis is an essential feature contributing to tumour growth, progression and metastasis 
formation and is predominantly triggered by the release of pro-angiogenic factors secreted by the tumour cell 
(i.e. VEGF and bFGF) to attract host endothelial as well as perivascular cells to facilitate oxygen and nutrient 
supply through the host vascular system. In preclinical disease models nintedanib, as single agent, effectively 
interfered with the formation and maintenance of the tumour vascular system resulting in tumour growth 
inhibition and tumour stasis. In particular, treatment of tumour xenografts with nintedanib led to a rapid 
reduction in tumour micro vessel density, pericytes vessel coverage and tumour perfusion. 
Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) measurements showed an anti-angiogenic 
effect of nintedanib in humans. It was not clearly dose dependent, but most responses were seen at doses 
of ≥ 200 mg. Logistic regression revealed a statistically significant association of the anti-angiogenic effect to 
nintedanib exposure. DCE-MRI effects were seen 24 - 48 h after the first medicine intake and were preserved or 
even increased after continuous treatment over several weeks. No correlation of the DCE-MRI response and 
subsequent clinically significant reduction in target lesion size was found, but DCE-MRI response was associated 
with disease stabilization (see SmPC sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Effects of nintedanib on the QT-interval were determined as a part of study 1199.26 which was a randomised, 
open-label, parallel-group Phase II study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of nintedanib versus sunitinib in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 54/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
previously untreated patients with renal cell cancer where observation regarding QT-prolongation was the main 
purpose of the interim report (enrolled patients =113; analysed for primary QTc endpoint= 64). 
In this study single oral doses of 200 mg nintedanib as well as multiple oral doses of 200 mg nintedanib 
administered twice daily for 15 days did not prolong the QTcF interval. The largest meantime-matched increase 
of QTcF at steady state was 3.1 ms (two-sided 90% CI: -0.2, 6.4). 
However, no thorough QT-trial of nintedanib administered in combination with docetaxel was conducted. 
In exploratory pharmacokinetic (PK)-adverse event analyses, higher exposure to nintedanib tended to be 
associated with liver enzyme elevations, but not with gastrointestinal adverse events. 
PK-efficacy analyses were not performed for clinical endpoints (see SmPC section 5.2). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic properties of nintedanib were similar in healthy volunteers, cancer patients, and patients 
of the target population. 
Under fed conditions the extent of absorption of nintedanib was increased around 20%. As the decrease in 
systemic exposure under fasted conditions is small, it can be assumed that in case nintedanib is taken without 
food on single occasions the impact on the overall steady state exposure of nintedanib will be limited. The target 
population may be severely affected by their malignant disease and food intake could be difficult. As a 
consequence, section 4.2 of the SmPC states that capsules of nintedanib must be taken orally, preferably with 
food, swallowed whole with water, and must not be chewed or crushed. 
Three different types of capsules were administered to healthy male volunteers. Bioequivalence has only been 
established between two capsule formulations (slow and fast dissolution). However, no clinical bioequivalence 
has been established between these two capsule formulations and the final formulation (intended commercial 
formulation). Although clinical bioequivalence between the final formulation and the two capsules (slow and 
fast) has not been established in an appropriate bioequivalence study, the applicant has described and justified 
in a sufficient way the lack of bioequivalence studies between the two capsule formulations (slow and fast 
dissolving) and the final formulation (intended commercial formulation). 
Less than 1 % of a single dose of nintedanib is excreted via the kidney (see section 5.2). Adjustment of the 
starting dose in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is not required (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 
5.2).  
Nintedanib has not been investigated in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.  Hepatic 
impairment and its potential effects on the PK of nintedanib were explored in several analyses based on 
transaminase and bilirubin levels. These included the Phase II/III PopPK studies 1199.3 and 1199.19, and the 
two exploratory PopPK analyses. All investigations indicated higher exposure to nintedanib in patients with 
elevated laboratory values. The applicant will submit the final data from the on-going trials investigating hepatic 
impairment (1199.37 by Q1 2015, 1199.39 by Q1 2015 and 1199.120 by Q1 2016) and discuss the possible 
influence of hepatic impairment on the PK of nintedanib when available (see RMP). 
Nintedanib is predominantly eliminated via biliary/faecal excretion (> 90 %). No adjustment of the starting dose 
is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment based on clinical data (Child Pugh A). The safety, efficacy, 
and pharmacokinetics of nintedanib have not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment classified as 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 55/138 
  
  
 
 
Child Pugh B and C. Therefore, treatment of patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) and severe (Child Pugh C) 
hepatic impairment with Vargatef is not recommended (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). 
No formal studies were conducted to examine gender, ethnicity, weight or age. In the Phase II/III PopPK 
analysis, age, race and body weight were found to affect the PK of nintedanib. Simulations revealed that none 
of the individual covariate effects alone identified in the Phase II/III PopPK analysis caused a change in exposure 
that exceeded the observed variability range of nintedanib. No a priori dose adjustments are required based on 
intrinsic factors like age, race and body weight as the variability of exposure observed is not considered clinically 
relevant. 
The Applicant has discussed dose adjustment in individuals with more than one covariate present. Data showed 
a significant proportion of patients with more than one covariate present would still have nintedanib plasma 
concentrations in the range observed in patients with no covariate present. Both for efficacy and safety the 
exposure-response relationships were rather weak, but in a given patient maximising exposure may be 
desirable from a benefit-risk perspective. Thus, the recommended posology, starting with a dose of 200 mg bid 
and then adapted according to the proposed dose reduction schemes seems reasonable. The dose reduction 
scheme is proposed in the SmPC which also recommends continuous monitoring of safety and tolerability in 
patients with more than one covariate that may lead to increased exposure to nintedanib. 
Since the effect of nintedanib on the metabolism and efficacy of contraceptives has not been investigated, 
barrier methods should be applied as a second form of contraception, to avoid pregnancy. 
Nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp however it was shown not to be a substrate or inhibitor of OATP-1B1, 
OATP-1B3, OATP-2B1, OCT-2, or MRP-2 in vitro. Nintedanib was also not a substrate of BCRP. Only a weak 
inhibitory potential on OCT-1, BCRP, and P-gp was observed in vitro which is considered to be of low clinical 
relevance. The same applies for nintedanib being a substrate of OCT-1. 
The applicant has provided an in-depth discussion on the possible inhibition of intestinal inhibition of CYP3A4, 
P-gp and BCRP. Based on in vitro data, nintedanib is considered a weak inhibitor of BCRP and P-gp. No in vitro 
Ki value against P-gp (max tested concentration 30 μmol/L) was established. The crude estimate of gut 
concentration (dose/250 ml) is likely a large overestimation as 1) the solubility of nintedanib decreases rapidly 
with increasing pH and the solubility of nintedanib in different buffer solutions at pH values of ≥ 6 is 0.001 mg/ml 
(approx. 1.85 µM) and 2) as nintedanib is intended to be administered with food.  
Further argumentation has also been provided in order to address the inductive effect of nintedanib on oral 
contraceptives. According to the EMA guideline on drug interactions “a potential human teratogen needs to be 
studied in vivo for effects on contraceptive steroids if the drug is intended for use in fertile women, regardless of 
the in vitro induction study results.” Therefore, the lack of a drug-drug interaction study investigating the 
inductive effect of nintedanib on oral contraceptives is acceptable given the current indication and patient 
population of nintedanib. However, if future approval for additional indications, where nintedanib is to be used 
in women of childbearing potential, is sought, it is important that a drug-drug interaction study investigating the 
inductive effect of nintedanib on oral contraceptives is performed. In the mean-time, a recommendation to use 
a barrier method as a second form of contraception has been included in the SmPC. 
The applicant has committed to provide data on in-vitro OAT1 and OAT3 inhibition post approval by Q4 2014. 
A clinically relevant drug-drug-interaction based on inhibition of UGT after oral administration of nintedanib is 
considered less likely as all IC50 values are substantially higher than the therapeutic plasma concentrations.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 56/138 
  
  
 
 
No obvious association between exposure and adverse events is apparent from a descriptive analysis of 
available data. 
Drug-drug interactions between nintedanib and CYP substrates, CYP inhibitors, or CYP inducers are not 
expected, since nintedanib, BIBF 1202, and BIBF 1202 glucuronide did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes in 
preclinical studies nor was nintedanib metabolized by CYP enzymes to a relevant extent (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Neither DCE-MRI response nor soluble levels of VEGF and bFGF could be associated with treatment effect after 
administration of nintedanib in at least three months. The biomarker research programme proposed as part of 
the ongoing clinical development programme for nintedanib will focus on the assessment of a larger panel of 
soluble plasma biomarkers, IHC of tumour cell proliferation and tumour MVD, mutational analysis of oncogenic 
driver mutations and nintedanib/angiogenesis-related target genes and gene expression analyses. It is to be 
updated annually for submission to the CHMP on a yearly basis. In accordance with the published data about 
circulating angiogenic factors (CAFs) it is planned to quantify a comprehensive panel of ~60 plasma markers in 
further studies with nintedanib in different indications including NSCLC. Furthermore, multiple genes (60) have 
been identified to have an oncogenic role and possibly play a role in angiogenesis, and the predictive value of 
these genes will be investigated further.  (see Conclusion on clinical efficacy and Annex II) 
The correlation between exposure to nintedanib with elevations of liver enzymes or bilirubin can be tackled by 
reducing the exposure with down-titration of the nintedanib dose. 
QT-prolongation is a recognised class effect of previously authorised TKIs (Shah et al., 2013), and the omission 
of a thorough QT study to investigate possible QT-prolongation of nintedanib, as well as nintedanib combined 
with docetaxel in lung cancer patients, has been justified. Additional wording has been included in the SmPC 
sections 4.4 and 5.1 in order to reflect the possible relation between TKIs and QT-prolongation. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology documentation submitted in support of the application for marketing authorisation of 
nintedanib is considered satisfactory. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to clinical pharmacology: (see 
RMP) 
-  Submission of results from trial PK1407T: In vitro evaluation of the interaction of nintedanib with human 
OAT transporters to determine the interaction potential of BIBF 1120 toward OAT1 and OAT3. The final 
report is expected by Q4 2014 
-  Data on nintedanib treatment in patients with hepatic impairment from trials 1199.37 and 1199.39 
(final report due Q1 2015) and trial 1199.120 in Japanese patients (final report due Q1 2016). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant submitted two Phase III trials to support the European Marketing Authorisation for Vargatef 
(nintedanib) for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, one pivotal study (1199.13) and one supportive 
study (1199.14).

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
A wide range of nintedanib monotherapy doses were investigated in phase I and II trials, from 50 to 450 mg q.d. 
and from 150 to 300 mg b.i.d. In phase I dose escalation trials (trials 1199.1, 1199.2, and 1199.3), the 
maximum tolerated dose was determined as 250 mg b.i.d. The predominant dose limiting toxicities were 
gastrointestinal AEs and fully reversible elevations in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) not accompanied by 
relevant bilirubin increases. Based on the nintedanib monotherapy data, a dose threshold for liver enzyme 
increases was observed at approximately 250 mg b.i.d., with higher frequencies of liver enzyme increases at 
nintedanib doses >200 mg b.i.d. compared to doses of ≤200 mg b.i.d. According to data from the trials 1199.1, 
.2, and .3, splitting the cumulative daily dose into 2 doses per day increased the tolerability of nintedanib, 
compared with once-daily dosing. In phase I trials combining nintedanib with pemetrexed, docetaxel, 
paclitaxel/carboplatin, or mFOLFOX6 (trials 1199.4, 1199.5, 1199.6, 1199.18, 1199.51), the recommended 
dose of nintedanib was established as 200 mg b.i.d. The pattern of AEs was comparable to the AE profile 
observed in phase I monotherapy trials except for the chemotherapy-related AEs. Based on the overall safety 
profile from all phase I and phase II studies, a nintedanib dose of 200 mg b.i.d. was selected for the combination 
with standard therapy of docetaxel (75mg/m2) in the phase III trial 1199.13. This starting dose could be 
reduced in two steps in case of intolerable AEs.  
2.5.2.  Main study

Treatments 
Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive nintedanib 200 mg orally in combination with 75 mg/m2 of 
intravenous iv. docetaxel every 21 days (n = 655) or placebo orally twice daily in combination with 75 mg/m2 
of docetaxel every 21 days (n = 659). 
Backbone chemotherapy 
Co-medication: 
To reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention and the severity of hypersensitivity reactions, all patients 
were to receive co-medication with oral corticosteroids. 
Additional chemo-, immuno-, hormone-, or radiotherapy was not permitted during the treatment period of this 
trial. For symptom control, palliative radiotherapy was permitted for bone metastases in extremities, provided 
that radiotherapy did not affect the target lesions, and that the need for radiotherapy did not result from 
progressive disease.

Objectives 
The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate whether nintedanib in combination with standard therapy of 
docetaxel is more effective than placebo in combination with standard therapy of docetaxel in patients with 
stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC after failure of first line chemotherapy. 
A secondary aim was to obtain safety information of patients treated with nintedanib in combination with 
standard therapy with docetaxel. 
`Locally recurrent´ was defined as local re occurrence of the tumour without metastases at study entry.

Sample size 
The alternative hypothesis assumed that the combination of nintedanib and docetaxel increased median PFS by 
approximately 28-32% in comparison to combination treatment with placebo and docetaxel, assuming a median 
PFS of 4 months in patients with an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 who are treated with docetaxel alone. It was calculated 
that a total of 713 PFS events would be needed to achieve a statistical power of 90%.

Although  the  sample  size used  in  this  trial  was  expected to  provide  80%  power  for  OS,  the  magnitude  and 
pattern  of  the  effect  of  any  third-line  (or  higher)  anticancer  therapy  after  disease  progression  could  have 
obscured the treatment effect. The below table shows that 1151 deaths provided a statistical power of 80% to 
detect an 18% increase in median OS for nintadanib plus docetaxel vs. docetaxel monotherapy (HR = 0.8475). 
The timing of the final analysis of OS will be adjusted to include as many deaths as possible within a reasonable 
period of time and will be conducted after 1151 patients have died, but might be performed with fewer deaths 
within approximately 48 months after the start of the trial. 
Table 13: Statistical power for overall survival  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 1:1. Randomisation was done in blocks of 4. Within each country, randomisation was 
stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), prior bevacizumab therapy (yes vs. no), tumour histology (squamous vs. 
non-squamous cell cancer) to balance for the higher bleeding risk associated with squamous cell carcinoma, and 
brain metastasis at baseline (yes vs. no). 
Blinding (masking) 
The trial had a parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Neither the patient nor the investigator 
was informed about the treatment allocation. All personnel of the sponsor and of the CRO who were involved in 
the conduct of the trial were unaware of the treatment allocation of patients until the final lock of the database. 
Statistical methods 
The alternative hypothesis of the primary analysis was that the PFS time was longer for patients treated with 
nintedanib plus docetaxel than for patients who received placebo plus docetaxel. The null hypothesis tested by 
this trial was: H0: S Nin+Doc(t) ≤ SPlacebo+Doc(t), for t > 0; with S(t) presenting the probability that a patient passes 
time t without dying or experiencing disease progression. The alpha level was 0.025. This was the same as the 
effect of nintedanib being tested at the two-sided 0.05 (5%) level if the treatment effect was in favour of 
nintedanib (e.g. if nintedanib exhibits longer PFS times on average). Two-sided p-values are presented and 
statistical significance was declared if these were significant at the 0.05 two-sided level if and only if the 
treatment effect was in favour of nintedanib. 
If both the primary and the follow-up PFS analyses showed a statistically significant treatment benefit of 
nintedanib over placebo, the key secondary endpoint OS was to be tested next in a fixed sequence of statistical 
hypotheses; i.e. in (1) patients with adenocarcinoma and <9 months since start of first-line therapy, (2) 
patients with adenocarcinoma, and (3) all patients. Each of the 3 hypotheses could only be tested at the 
pre-specified alpha level if the previous null hypothesis in the testing sequence had been rejected. The overall 
alpha level followed a Lan-DeMets spending function with O'Brien-Fleming shape parameter to preserve an 
overall 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. Hence, the exact overall alpha level (0.04984) depended on the number of

deaths that had accrued at the interim OS analysis (n = 423 OS events) and the number of deaths accrued by 
the time of final OS analysis (n = 1121 OS events). 
Five (5) analysis data sets were used; these were the screened set (SS), the randomised set (RS), the treated 
set (TS), the safety set (SFS), and the pharmacokinetic set (PKS). 
The RS included all randomised patients, whether patients had received study treatment or not. The efficacy 
analyses were based on the RS, following the intent-to-treat principle; however, patients not receiving 
combination therapy (i.e. nintedanib/placebo and docetaxel) were censored to the date of randomisation. 
The TS included all randomised patients who were documented to have taken at least 1 dose of study medication 
(i.e. docetaxel chemotherapy or nintedanib/placebo). Patients were allocated to the treatment groups according 
to the treatment actually received. Safety analyses for this trial were based on the TS if not indicated otherwise. 
The SFS included all patients who were documented to have received at least 1 dose of investigational treatment 
(i.e. nintedanib/placebo). Patients were allocated to the treatment groups as actually treated. The exposure to 
nintedanib/placebo was analysed based on the SFS. 
The PKS included all patients in the TS who were documented to have received at least 1 dose of nintedanib and 
who had at least 1 valid drug plasma concentration available. The PKS was used for the analysis of 
pharmacokinetic (PK) data. 
During the study, the statistical analysis plan was extended by introducing a stepwise validation of the clinical 
biomarker hypothesis before the database was locked and unblinded for its final OS analysis.

Recruitment 
The trial was conducted from 23 December 2008 to 15 February 2013 (cut-off date): 11 patients were still being 
treated in the trial. 
Conduct of the study 
Main changes in the Trial Statistical Analysis Plan (TSAP):  
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS based on central independent review, including events that occurred until 
the cut-off date of the efficacy analyses (defined by the time point of the 713th PFS event as per central review). 
With the TSAP (signed 8 July 2011), the following endpoints were formally added as secondary efficacy 
endpoints: 
- 
- 
PFS based on investigator assessment 
PFS based on central independent review, including all randomised patients and events that occurred 
until the cut-off date of the safety analyses 
The TSAP made a number of clarifications regarding the censoring rules for the primary endpoint PFS.  
In addition, the TSAP provided clarifications regarding a number of analyses pre-specified in the clinical trial 
protocol. Importantly, the Brookmeyer and Crowley method was used for summary statistics of the primary 
endpoint PFS (not the Greenwood variance formula specified in the clinical trial protocol). The TSAP provided 
definition of the patient subgroups to be investigated regarding the primary efficacy endpoint and selected 
parameters of disposition, demographics, and safety. The TSAP clarified that dependent on the results of the 
primary PFS analysis, an additional interim analysis of OS could be performed for regulatory purposes. The alpha 
spending procedure was a Lan-DeMets spending function with O’Brien-Fleming shape parameter. 
Extension of the TSAP prior to un-blinding of the database for the primary PFS analysis 
The generation of a biomarker hypothesis from trial 1199.14 led to extension of the TSAP for trial 1199.13 
(signed 23 January 2013) prior to locking the trial database by introducing 2 intermediate steps of hierarchical 
testing for the final OS analysis.  
Protocol deviations: 
Overall, 24 patients (1.8% of randomised patients) were reported to have at least one important (pre-specified) 
protocol violation (placebo: 1.7% vs. nintedanib: 2.0%).

*Exploratory analysis in patients with squamous cell carcinoma found that the larger the SLD of target lesions at baseline the 
better the treatment effect, as indicated by a decreasing HR. The estimated HR reached values below 1 at SLD values around 
7.5 cm; therefore, an SLD ≥7.5 cm was chosen as cut-point for further in-depth analyses in patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma.  
The Applicant used three methods that all revealed 9 months cut-off since start of first-line therapy in the 
adenocarcinoma patients as predictive of effect of nintedanib.  
An exploratory analysis of OS by T<9 months and T≥9 months showed that the HR was 0.75 (95%CI; 0.60, 
0.92) and 0.89 (95%CI; 0.66, 1.19) respectively.

•  PFS and OS in patients with local recurrence with or without metastases 
Evaluation of the primary endpoint PFS in the overall study population revealed that there was no interaction 
between treatment and recurrence with or without metastases at baseline (p=0.5822). Similar results are 
observed for the adenocarcinoma (primary analysis, p=0.9593) and for the squamous cell carcinoma (primary 
analysis, p=0.5383) patient populations. 
•  Clinical improvement 
Most deterioration events were caused by increase in ECOG performance score. More than half of the patients 
were censored, mostly due to subsequent anticancer therapy or no event prior to cut-off date. Therefore the 
applicant was requested to provide time to deterioration of body weight and/or ECOG PS for the adenocarcinoma 
population in study 1199.13.

Page 80/138 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Table 34: Time to deterioration of body weight and/or ECOG PS / RS – adenocarcinoma histology 
There is a slightly longer time to deterioration in the nintedanib arm (not statistically significant). Thus, the 
addition of nintedanib to docetaxel shows no detrimental effect on time to deterioration of body weight and/or 
ECOG.  
•  QoL 
Focus was on the main HRQoL endpoints, i.e. cough (QLQ-LC13 question 1), dyspnoea (composite of QLQ-LC13 
questions 3-5), and pain (composite of QLQ-C30 questions 9 and 19). Compliance with completion of the HRQoL 
questionnaires  was  relatively  high  (>80%  in  both  treatment  arms).  Analyses  were  performed  in  the  overall 
population and in groups based on histology (adenocarcinoma, non-squamous, squamous). 
There was no difference in time to deterioration of cough, dyspnoea, and pain between treatment arms. The 
percentages of patients with worsening, stabilisation, or improvement of cough, dyspnoea, pain and symptom 
scales/items were similar in both treatment arms. 
Overall, the global health status was maintained with nintedanib (HR 0.952; 95% CI 0.827, 1.096). Similar 
results were found for all histology groups. 
In the overall patient population, individual items of QLQ-C30 with a difference between treatment arms were 
time to deterioration of diarrhoea (HR 1.940; 95% CI 1.665, 2.260), nausea (HR 1.295; 95% CI 1.113, 1.508) 
and vomiting (HR 1.319: 95% CI 1.106, 1.573) which were shorter in the nintedanib arm. No differences in HRs 
were found in QLQ-LC13 scores. 
As  for  the  overall  population,  patients  with  tumours  of  adenocarcinoma  histology  had  a  shorter  time  to 
deterioration of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Different from the overall population, time to pain in arm or 
shoulder was favoured by nintedanib (HR 0.794; 95% CI 0.632, 0.997). Similar results were seen in patients 
with tumour of non-squamous histology. 
However, diarrhoea is more common in the nintedanib arm. This finding is statistically significant, but based on 
patient-self reported outcome.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
At the time of the final OS analysis in trial 1199.13, a meta-analysis was performed for PFS, pooling the data for 
the non-squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and T<9m adenocarcinoma population from trials 1199.13 
and 1199.14 (cut-off date 15 Feb 2013), and for OS.

When  pooling  the  data,  nintedanib  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  statistically  significantly  improved 
centrally  assessed  PFS  in  the  adenocarcinoma  population  (HR  0.84;  95%  CI  0.74,  0.95;  p=0.0072).  The 
treatment benefit of nintedanib plus chemotherapy on PFS became more pronounced in the pooled dataset of 
patients with adenocarcinoma who progressed during or shortly after first-line therapy (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.61, 
0.84; p<0.0001). OS was not statistically significant in this analysis.

Supportive study 
Study 1199.14 is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in patients with non-squamous NSCLC. 
Despite being halted prematurely, ITT analysis of the primary endpoint PFS assessed by central independent 
review  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  improvement  for  patients  treated  with  nintedanib  plus 
pemetrexed compared with placebo plus pemetrexed. In line with the observations in trial 1199.13, patients 
with  adenocarcinoma  who  progressed  during  or  shortly  after  first-line  therapy  also  derived  benefit  from 
treatment with nintedanib and pemetrexed. Altogether, the findings in trial 1199.14 were consistent with the 
findings in trial 1199.13.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
One phase III pivotal study (1199.13 (LUME Lung 1)) and one supportive phase III study (1199.14 (LUME Lung 
2)) have been submitted in support of this application.  
Both studies are well-designed: randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group and placebo-controlled. Study 
1199.13 included approximately 650 patients in each treatment arm, patient characteristics were balanced 
between treatment arms within the overall population and within subgroups according to histology. In the 
overall population, 72.7 % of the patients were male. The majority of patients were non-Asian (81.6 %), the 
median age was 60.0 years, the baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)  performance status 
was 0 (28.6 %) or 1 (71.3 %); one patient had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2.  
5.8 % of the patients had stable brain metastasis at study entry and 3.8 % had prior bevacizumab treatment. 
Patients with NSCLC with disease stage IIIB and IV were eligible for the studies. In study 1199.13 the effects of 
nintedanib + docetaxel are investigated compared to placebo+docetaxel and in study 1199.14 the effects of 
nintedanib + pemetrexed are investigated compared to placebo+docetaxel. Both background treatments 
(docetaxel and pemetrexed) are well-known and reflect current clinical practice. Analyses of OS for the 
nintedanib-docetaxel combination in second-line resulted in comparable improvement in OS regardless of 
whether patients were treated with pemetrexed in first-line or not; i.e. HR for OS was 0.79 for patients 
previously treated with pemetrexed and 0.83 for patients not previously treated with pemetrexed. No treatment 
interaction was found between treatment arm and first-line pemetrexed treatment when these groups were 
compared. Thus, the patients in study 1199.13 do not seem to be undertreated in first-line. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 87/138 
 
  
  
 
 
Paclitaxel in combination with platinum is registered for the first-line treatment of NSCLC. Approximately 20% 
of the patients in study 1199.13 were treated with paclitaxel in first-line. The applicant has performed an 
analysis of OS in patients with and without paclitaxel in first-line showing an HR for OS in those without 
paclitaxel in first-line of 0.86, while those treated with paclitaxel in first-line had an HR of 0.75. No significant 
interaction was found between treatment arm and first-line taxane treatment. The applicant also refers to 
several studies where docetaxel in second-line has been given after first-line paclitaxel. This includes the 
registrational study for docetaxel. Thus, the use of docetaxel after paclitaxel in study 1199.13 seems 
unproblematic 
While trial 1199.13 included NSCLC patients irrespective of tumour histology, trial 1199.14 included patients 
with non-squamous (mostly adenocarcinoma) tumour histology since pemetrexed is indicated for NSCLC with 
other than predominantly squamous tumour histology. Patients were successfully randomised according to 
stratification factors identified as important prognostic factors; i.e. tumour histology, ECOG PS, prior 
bevacizumab treatment and brain metastases. Patients with EGFR-mutation were not excluded from the trials, 
and only a few were screened for mutation. EGFR mutated patients have a better outcome in terms of PFS and 
OS compared with patients that are EGFR WT. However, at the time of conduct of study 1199.13 this was not 
clearly understood by the scientific community. Thus, the Applicant has not systematically collected EGFR 
status. Nonetheless, there is information regarding EGRF status in 16.9% of the patients.  Of those, only 20 
patients were positive for EGFR mutations, 12 in the placebo group and 8 in the nintedanib group. The applicant 
has not conducted any analyses on these small numbers which is understandable and endorsed. The comparison 
of the PFS and OS results of study 1199.13 with the TITAN 1, TAILOR 2 and DELTA3 studies revealed that there 
seems to be no indication of an overrepresentation of patients with EGFR mutations in study 1199.13. 
Furthermore, there are more Asian patients in placebo group, and bearing in mind that EGFR mutations are 
more common in Asian patients, there is still a favourable effect in favour of nintedanib. Thus, any impact of a 
potential imbalance in EGFR mutated patients seems to have little effect on the study results. 
Another important mutation is the EML4-ALK fusion oncogene. EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK fusion oncogene 
are mutually exclusive. The number of patients with EML4-ALK fusion oncogene is relatively low and considered 
to be around 4-7% in the NSCLC population (Soda et al. 2007, Koivunen et al. 2008). Thus, the number of 
patient with EML4-ALK fusion oncogene in study 1199.13 is expected to be low. The applicant has not provided 
any efficacy data on the effect of nintedanib in patients with EML4-ALK fusion oncogene. However, since it is 
current clinical practice to test for EML4-ALK fusion oncogene in patients with lung cancer, and since these 
patients are offered more targeted treatment with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib, the effect of 
nintedanib in these patients is not considered relevant. 
The objective of both studies was to demonstrate superiority of nintedanib+docetaxel/pemetrexed over 
docetaxel or pemetrexed with regard to PFS by independent central review.  
On 18 Jun 2011, recruitment into trial 1199.14 was stopped, based on the futility analysis performed by an 
independent DMC and the study was unblinded. Trial 1199.14 did not pass the futility analysis, which indicated

that the endpoint PFS based on investigator assessment would likely not be met. The DMC, however, did not 
identify any safety concerns. Based on the DMC's recommendation, the Applicant halted further recruitment into 
the trial on 18 Jun 2011. At this time, a total of 713 patients had been enrolled into the trial. For the 183 patients 
still on treatment on 18 Jun 2011, the treatment code was broken however patients were still followed. 
A retrospective analysis of the conditional and predictive power in trial 1199.14 over time, evaluating both PFS 
by investigator assessment and central assessment, showed that the only time when the conditional power 
dropped to around 20% was at the predefined time point of the futility analysis. The analyses also showed that 
the conditional power was generally lower for PFS by investigator assessment than for PFS by central 
independent review. 
Upon review of the results of the primary analysis of trial 1199.14, the DMC issued a statement that is part of the 
formal record of the study, concluding in retrospect: 
"...that the futility calculation, upon which it based its decision to stop the study, was an inadequate estimate of 
the true futility. This appears to be a result of a discordance between investigator assessments and the central 
assessments of PFS as well as a statistical aberration at the single time point evaluated. The current data review, 
which includes the mature and completed data regarding both PFS and OS, with PFS results based upon an 
independent, central review, demonstrates a strong positive trend favoring the experimental arm in LUME Lung 
2." 
The statistical analysis plan of study 1199.13 was amended before database lock and un-blinding. Overall 
survival (OS) was to be tested in hierarchical fashion, where the first intermediate step will be to test the OS 
effect in adenocarcinoma patients with time since start of first line therapy <9 months (T<9 months), then OS 
in the adenocarcinoma population, and finally in the overall NSCLC population.  A thorough review revealed that 
tthat the results presented for PFS and OS in the overall population as well as stratified by histology remain 
unaffected by the choice to amend the TSAP. 
The Applicant has given details on the timelines for analyses performed in the search for and validation of a 
clinical biomarker. All biomarker analysis findings, as well as the interim 1199.13 results at the time-point of the 
PFS (central review) read-out, were kept confidential behind a fire-wall; nothing was disclosed externally prior 
to the read-out of the final OS data from 1199.13. 
Further to the CHMP request, the applicant has provided a comprehensive research plan aiming at identifying 
factors predictive for sensitivity as well as resistance to nintedanib in patients with advanced NSCLC. The type 
and number of soluble plasma marker to be analysed are satisfactory. Furthermore, multiple genes (60) have 
been identified to have an oncogenic role and possibly play a role in angiogenesis, and the predictive value of 
these genes will be further investigated. The Applicant is requested to submit data on an annual basis from the 
tumour biomarker analyses programme which includes testing of samples collected from the LUME-Lung 1 and 
LUME-Lung 2 for germline genetic variability in angiogenic factors, a single arm study on predictive biomarkers 
in NSCLC patients eligible for treatment with nintedanib, and implementation of bio-tumour marker testing in all 
clinical studies in the clinical program for nintedanib (See Annex II).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Based on the analysis of the primary endpoint (never changed and therefore not affected by the hypothesis 
generation), study 1199.13 had met the prospectively defined primary endpoint centrally assessed PFS. A 
statistically significant difference in median PFS is demonstrated with a hazard ratio of 0.85 in the follow-up 
analysis. These results are supported by PFS by investigator (secondary endpoint), which also demonstrates a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 89/138 
  
  
 
 
statistically significant HR (0.82). In patients with non-squamous and squamous tumour histology, no 
detrimental effect on OS was seen, with a HR of 0.94 (95%CI, 0.83; 1.05, p=0.2720) in the overall population 
and a HR of 0.88 (95%CI, 0.75; 1.03, p=0.1133) in the non-squamous population.  However, in the follow-up 
analysis of PFS, the benefit of nintedanib treatment in patients with tumours of non-squamous and squamous 
histology did not reach statistical significance, HR 0.85 (95% CI; 0.73, 1.00, p=0.0556) and HR 0.83 (95% CI; 
0.69, 1.01, p=0.0566) respectively.  
With regard to OS, there is an indication that nintedanib + docetaxel has a clinically relevant and important 
effect on patients with adenocarcinoma with T<9 months (patients with poor treatment prognosis) and the 
adenocarcinoma population in general. In the adenocarcinoma population the median OS was 12.6 months in 
the nintedanib + docetaxel arm compared to 10.3 months in the placebo + docetaxel arm. The difference of 2.3 
months in OS in favour of nintedanib is a clinically relevant difference. This should be seen in the context of the 
clinical setting for patients with NSCLC stage IIIB disease who have a median survival of approximately 10 
months, while patients with stage IV disease have a median survival of approximately 6 months. With regard to 
patients with adenocarcinoma and T<9 months, the median is 10.9 months in the nintedanib + docetaxel arm 
compared to 7.9 months in the placebo + docetaxel arm. These patients have a more aggressive disease, hence 
the shorter median OS, but a difference of 3 months in median OS is clinically relevant.  
The applicant used three methods that all revealed 9 months cut-off since start of first-line therapy in the 
adenocarcinoma patients as predictive of effect of nintedanib. In addition, the applicant has presented a clinical 
plausible rationale for the 9 months cut-off. It is possible though that the OS result in adenocarcinoma patients 
is driven by patients with less than 9 months since start of first-line treatment. However, an explorative analysis 
where patients with less than 9 months since start of first-line from treatment are excluded to allow assessment 
of the efficacy of nintedanib in patients with more than 9 month since start of first-line treatment, showed a 
benefit in favour of nintedanib regardless of time since start of first-line treatment. Although, the HR was 0.89 
in the group of patients with T≥9 months and there was a difference in median OS of 1.9 months, statistical 
significance was not reached. Nonetheless, there is a strong trend in favour of nintedanib. 
The subgroup analyses show consistent results that support the overall OS estimate in the adenocarcinoma 
population. However, it seems that patients with adenocarcinoma and brain metastases or disease stage 
<IIIB/IV may have no effect of nintedanib + docetaxel, but the numbers are low, and the 95% CIs are wide and 
include the overall OS estimate.  
Although it cannot be completely excluded that the decision to pursue the adenocarcinoma population was at 
least in part data driven, the applicant has provided a fair justification for a biological rationale explaining the 
better efficacy in the adenocarcinoma subgroup and also provided external validation of the findings. Alltogether 
this justifies the indication encompassing the adenocarcinoma population only.  
There was no benefit of treating all patients with squamous tumour histology, HR 1.01 (95% CI 0.85, 1.21; 
p=0.8907). A post-hoc analysis of treatment effect of nintedanib in patients with squamous tumour with SLD 
≥7.5 cm at baseline, indicated that patients with large tumour mass may respond to nintedanib; HR for PFS was 
0.71 (95% CI 0.56, 0.91; p=0.0072). The result for the OS analysis in this population was not statistically 
significant but there was a trend for improvement with a median OS 7.7 months compared to 6.1 months; HR 
0.82 (95% CI 0.65, 1.04; p=0.0995).  
Patients with recurrent disease are included in the applied indication. According to the CSR, 9.2% of the overall 
population has locally recurrent disease. Of the total population, 21.7% had previous surgery and 28.8% had 
radiotherapy while very few had chemotherapy (4%). The applicant has provided an analysis that divide 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 90/138 
  
  
 
 
patients according to whether they had local recurrence with and without metastases at baseline. Patients with 
re-occurrence of their disease without metastases could be expected to have a more favourable prognosis and 
perhaps a different response to treatment with nintedanib. According to the analyses presented by the applicant 
there seems to be no interaction between treatment and recurrence neither in the overall population, nor in the 
histology subgroups (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell). The numbers of patients are small and no definitive 
conclusion can be drawn. However, there are no signals giving doubt to whether nintedanib should be given to 
this patient group. 
With regard to tumour response, a clinically relevant difference in disease control was observed in favour of 
nintedanib. No relevant differences were observed with regard to “clinical improvement” and “QoL”. Most 
importantly, nintedanib did not have any major detrimental effect on clinical status or QoL.  
Nintedanib did not significantly change the time to deterioration of the pre-specified symptoms cough, dyspnoea 
and pain, but resulted in a significant deterioration in the diarrhoea symptom scale. Nevertheless, the overall 
treatment benefit of nintedanib was observed without adversely affecting self-reported quality of life. 
In study 1199.14, the median OS in patients with adenocarcinoma is 13.1 months vs. 12.3 months in favour of 
placebo + pemetrexed however the HR is 1.00 (95% CI: 0.84 to 1.20), p=0.9616. Thus, no firm conclusions can 
be drawn from this study that was prematurely halted. KM-curves clearly show that the difference in median OS, 
is a chance finding due to technical limitations of KM-curves. This is a well-known limitation of KM-curves, 
reason why it is important to also focus on the HR, the 95%Cis and the p-value. The curves separate at two 
months, cross over at 8-9 months and back again at 22-23 months.  Thus, based on the above uncertainties and 
limitations of study 1199.14, any overall interpretation of the results and attempt to conclude would be 
inappropriate. Nonetheless, in line with the observations in trial 1199.13, patients with adenocarcinoma who 
progressed during or shortly after first-line therapy also derived benefit from treatment with nintedanib and 
pemetrexed. Altogether, the findings in trial 1199.14 were consistent with the findings in trial 1199.13 and 
strengthen the premise that addition of nintedanib to standard chemotherapy improves clinical outcomes in the 
second-line treatment of patients with NSCLC and tumour histology adenocarcinoma. 
From a pharmacokinetic point of view, the Applicant has investigated the potential impact of an imbalance in 
polymorphisms related to VEGF1-3, FGF 1-3 and PDGF alfa and beta, but no significant difference has been 
found. In addition, there is no evidence for a difference in EGFR mutation status that could explain the results. 
The median PFS and OS in Asian patients are consistent with the overall results. There is no indication of any 
interaction between the non-Asian and Asian subgroups. Thus, it seems that the only reliable explanation is the 
small number of Asian patients.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The study 1199.13 provides evidence for a clinically relevant and statistically significant difference in PFS in the 
overall NSCLC population in favour of nintedanib. The efficacy results reported in the adenocarcinoma 
subpopulation in study 1199.13 indicate a significant effect on OS.  These findings are supported by study 
1199.14. In conclusion, both studies are supportive of beneficial effects of nintedanib in the adenocarcinoma 
patient population.

In order to investigate suitable bio- tumour markers (including VEGF) to allow identification and selection of a 
more targeted population of patients most likely to benefit from the treatment of nintedanib, the Applicant will 
conduct and submit results from a Biomarkers research programme including: 
-  Collected blood samples from the LUME-Lung 1 and LUME-Lung 2 studies will be assessed for germline 
genetic variability in angiogenic factors, including VEGF or its downstream receptors.  
-  Single arm study to examine whether genetic/genomic markers (alone or combined with clinical 
covariates) could be used to predict overall survival (OS) in NSCLC patients eligible for treatment with 
nintedanib. 
-  Data on bio/tumour markers from all clinical studies in the clinical program for nintedanib.  
The applicant will implement collection of material for biomarker investigation and analyses of 
biomarker data into the study protocol of all new oncology studies planned for nintedanib in the future, 
wherever clinically appropriate. 
Results will be provided as they become available on a yearly basis -Submission of final study report

2.6.   Clinical safety 
An integrated analysis of the safety data from 35 completed and ongoing trials was provided. Among 35 studies, 
a total of 8 nintedanib trials were performed in patients with NSCLC. This comprised 4 phase I trials (1199.5, 
1199.18, 1199.28, and 1199.29), one phase I/II trial (1199.82), one phase II trial (1199.10), and 2 phase III 
trials (1199.13 and 1199.14). 
Safety data was presented in different safety analysis sets (SAF).

Exposure to docetaxel judged by mean docetaxel courses and mean cumulative dose was greater in the 
nintedanib arm (5.1 courses, 374.91 mg/m2) than in the placebo arm (4.6 courses, 341.31 mg/m2) of pivotal 
trial 1199.13 (all patients). A slightly higher docetaxel exposure was observed in patients with adenocarcinoma 
histology, i.e. nintedanib arm; 5.7 courses, 421.27 mg/m2, placebo arm; 5.1 courses, 374.14 mg/m2.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
The analysis of AESIs aimed to provide more information about the potential adverse reactions of nintedanib, 
potential class effects of VEGFR inhibitors and the general characterisation of the safety profile of combination 
therapy with docetaxel and nintedanib.  
The following AESIs were analysed: Listed AEs as possible adverse drug reactions of nintedanib including AESIs 
selected based on potential association/complication of AEs; Potential class effects of VEGFR inhibitors; AESIs 
selected based on potential interaction with concomitant chemotherapy; AESIs selected based on competitor 
labelling; Cardiac events; Other AEs of interest.

Cardiac events 
Other adverse events 
The most commonly reported AESIs occurring in more than 30% of patients with adenocarcinoma in trial 
1199.13 treated with nintedanib in combination with docetaxel were neutropenia (SSC), diarrhoea (SSC), 
fatigue (SSC), and liver-related investigation (SMQ).  
Differences between the nintedanib and placebo arms of ≥5% of patients with adenocarcinoma were observed 
for: diarrhoea, liver related investigations, specific liver related investigation, nausea (SSC), vomiting (SSC), 
mucositis (SMQ: 16.6% nintedanib; 11.4% placebo), and cutaneous serious skin reactions (SSC: 15.6% 
nintedanib; 10.5% placebo). 
Diarrhoea 
The SSC diarrhoea was defined by the MedDRA PT ‘diarrhoea’.

Age  ≥65  years,  female,  ECOG  performance  score  >0  at  baseline,  body  weight  <50  kg  at  baseline,  and 
geographic region Asia were defined before data analysis as potential risk factors for diarrhoea. The number of 
patients with diarrhoea of worst grade ≥3 was low (20 patients nintedanib; 12 patients placebo), and the 95% 
CIs were very wide and overlapping for the risk and complementary groups. No risk factors were identified in 
patients with adenocarcinoma in trial 1199.13. 
In patients experiencing diarrhoea in the overall population (study 1199.13), the median time to the first onset 
of diarrhoea of any CTCAE grade was comparable between the study treatment groups: 10 days for placebo (5, 
47 days; P25% 75%) versus 13 days for nintedanib (5, 47 days; P25% 75%). Results were consistent for the 
adenocarcinoma. In all patients, median time to the first onset of diarrhoea of grade ≥3 was 6 days for placebo 
(4, 25 days; P25% 75%) versus 28 days for nintedanib (7, 86 days; P25% 75%). A similar trend was seen for 
the adenocarcinoma population of study 1199.13 with diarrhoea of grade ≥3. 
The median duration of diarrhoea (all severity grades) was prolonged in the nintedanib arm as compared to the 
placebo arm in both the overall population (placebo: 6 days versus nintedanib: 12 days) and the 
adenocarcinoma population (placebo: 5 days versus nintedanib: 16.5 days). A similar trend was seen for both 
populations with diarrhoea of grade ≥3. 
Diarrhoea was generally manageable with supportive care, dose interruption, and dose reduction, and led to 
treatment discontinuation only in a few patients. In the majority of cases, the patient recovered, however, in 
one case the outcome of the diarrhoea was fatal in the nintedanib arm. Very few events led to permanent 
discontinuation. 
Liver enzyme elevations

Table 48: Incidence and clinical consequences of the SMQ liver-related investigation in phase III trials 1199.13 
and 1199.14 (SAF-1), in nintedanib phase I/II monotherapy trials (SAF-2), and in patients with cancer treated 
with nintedanib (SAF-3) – TS 
In the overall population (study 1199.13), the median time to the first onset of the liver enzyme elevation (AST 
and/or ALT any CTCAE grade based on laboratory measurements) was similar between the study groups: 16 
days placebo (8, 43 days; P25% 75%) vs 14 days nintedanib (8, 29 days; P25% 75%). This implied that half of 
the patients that developed a 'liver enzyme elevation' in the nintedanib arm had the first event within the first 
14 days after first administration of study medication. Similar results were observed for patients with 
adenocarcinoma (all severity grades) (study 1199.13).  
Median time to first onset of grade ≥3 liver enzyme elevations was 21 days (14, 45 days; P25% 75%) in all 
patients experiencing this event in the nintedanib arm and 26 days (15, 45 days; P25% 75%) in the 
adenocarcinoma patients experiencing this event in the nintedanib arm.  
These increases were reversible in the majority of cases. The median duration of liver enzyme elevation of any 
grade based on laboratory values was 15 days (grade ≥3, was 8 days) for both all patients as well as 
adenocarcinoma patients. Most of the patients recovered and only few events led to permanent discontinuation. 
Most events occurred within the first 3 months of treatment. 
Nausea and Vomiting 
The SSC nausea was defined by the MedDRA preferred terms ‘nausea’ and ‘retching’. In the overall population 
(all severity grades, study 1199.13), more patients had nausea in the nintedanib than in the placebo treatment 
group (placebo 18.0% vs nintedanib 24.2%). Consistent with this, more patients in the adenocarcinoma 
population experienced nausea in the nintedanib than in the placebo treatment group (placebo 17.7% vs 
nintedanib 28.4%).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 101/138 
 
  
  
 
 
In the overall population (all severity grades), the median time to the first onset of nausea was greater for 
patients experiencing the event in the nintedanib than in the placebo treatment group: 13 days placebo (4, 34 
days; P25% 75%) vs 21 days nintedanib (4, 64 days; P25% 75%). The corresponding results for the 
adenocarcinoma population (all severity grades, study 1199.13) showed that the time to first onset for patients 
experiencing the event in the placebo and nintedanib groups were similar; 20 days placebo (5, 51 days; P25% 
75%) vs 22 days nintedanib (3, 62 days; P25% 75%). Median time to first onset regarding nausea of grade ≥3 
was not considered due to the small sample size. Median duration of nausea was about 3 weeks (overall and 
adenocarcinoma population; all grades and grade ≥3). For the duration of nausea with CTCAE grade ≥3, the 
worst CTCAE grade was collected. 
The SSC vomiting was defined by the MedDRA preferred terms ‘vomiting’ and ‘regurgitation’. However, there 
were no ‘regurgitation’ AEs reported. In the overall population (all severity grades, study 1199.13), more 
patients had vomiting in the nintedanib arm than in the placebo treatment group (nintedanib 16.9% vs. placebo 
9.3%). Consistent with this, more patients in the adenocarcinoma population experienced vomiting in the 
nintedanib than in the placebo treatment group (nintedanib 19.4% vs placebo 12.3%). There was almost no 
difference between the nintedanib and placebo treatment groups for the time to first onset of AEs within the SSC 
vomiting. In the overall population (all severity grades, study 1199.13), the median time to the first onset of 
vomiting was similar for patients experiencing vomiting in the placebo and nintedanib treatment groups: 25 
days placebo (7, 49 days; P25% 75%) vs 23 days nintedanib (5, 59 days; P25% 75%). Numbers on median 
time to first onset regarding grade ≥3 vomiting were not considered due to the small sample size both in the 
overall and the adenocarcinoma populations. Median duration of vomiting was about 1 week (overall and 
adenocarcinoma population; all grades and grade ≥3). It is noted that for the duration of vomiting with CTCAE 
grade ≥3, the worst CTCAE grade was collected. 
Hepatic failure 
In pivotal trial 1199.13 (all patients) hepatic failure was more common in the nintedanib arm [n=8 (1.2%), 
grade ≥3: n=5 (0.8%)] than in the placebo arm [n=1 (0.2%), grade ≥3: no cases]. Hepatic failure was also 
more frequent in the nintedanib arm (n=8, 2.4%) than in the placebo arm (n=4, 1.2%) of trial 1199.14 
(adenocarcinoma). AEs within the SMQ hepatic failure were reported in 2.3% of patients on nintedanib 
monotherapy ≤200 mg b.i.d., 5.9% of patients on nintedanib monotherapy >200 mg b.i.d.,and 3.3% of 
patients with cancer treated with nintedanib. 
The majority of the reported AEs classified as hepatic failure, did not correspond with hepatocellular 
drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Only one patient (in study 1199.14) has been identified to possible have DILI. 
In this case ALT and AST increased and bilirubin was marginally increased. Treatment with nintedanib was 
interrupted. Liver parameters returned to normal.  When re-challenged the ALT and AST increased again, but 
bilirubin was normal or minimally elevated. This patient did not have liver metastases or any other condition that 
could have introduced bias. However, the patient did not show clinical signs of jaundice. The patient continued 
treatment until day 268.

Bleeding 
The MedDRA SMQ ‘bleeding’ was used. In the overall population (all severity grades, study 1199.13), there was 
a slight imbalance of patients between the treatment arms developing a bleeding event (placebo 11.6% vs 
nintedanib 14.1%). This was due to more patients with low grade bleeding in the nintedanib arm as compared 
to the placebo arm in the squamous cell cancer population (10.8% vs 17.1%). In the adenocarcinoma 
population bleeding events were rather balanced between the treatment groups (placebo 11.1% vs nintedanib 
10.9%). The majority of bleeding events were considered of mild to moderate severity (e.g. epistaxis) and 
almost all patients recovered from the bleeding events. There was almost no difference between the nintedanib 
and placebo treatment groups for the time to first onset of bleeding. In the overall population (all severity 
grades), the median time to the first onset of bleeding was the same for patients developing a bleeding event in 
the two treatment groups: 28 days placebo (11, 86 days; P25% 75%) vs 28 days nintedanib (8, 73 days; P25% 
75%). The corresponding results for the adenocarcinoma population (all severity grades) were consistent with 
the overall population: 27 days placebo (13, 98 days; P25% 75%) vs 25 days nintedanib (8, 70 days; P25% 
75%). The median duration of bleeding, was 10.5 days (overall population, and 5 days for the adenocarcinoma 
population, all severity grades). 
The most commonly reported bleeding event in study 1199.13 was epistaxis (reported by 2.7% of patients in 
the placebo arm and 4.9% in the nintedanib arm); epistaxis was mainly of grade 1 or 2. The majority of fatal 
bleeding events were tumour-associated. There were no imbalances of respiratory or fatal bleedings for 
adenocarcinoma patients (respiratory bleeding: 6.0% vs 4.7%; fatal bleeding: 0.6% vs 0.9%) and no 
intracerebral bleeding was reported. 
Thromboembolic events  
The overall rate of patients with AEs within the SMQ thromboembolic events was low. In patients with 
adenocarcinoma in trial 1199.13, there was no difference between the treatment arms in the overall rate of 
patients with thromboembolic events (5.3% nintedanib; 5.4% placebo, grade ≥3 2.5% vs. 3.3%). AEs within 
the AESI arterial thromboembolism were reported in 0.9% of patients in the nintedanib arm and 2.1% of 
patients in the placebo arm (0.9% grade ≥3 in each arm); AEs within the SMQ venous thromboembolism were 
reported in 2.8% of patients (0.9% grade ≥3) in the nintedanib arm, and 1.2% of patients (0.6% grade ≥3) in 
the placebo arm. The imbalance was mainly due to deep vein thrombosis and there was no difference of 
pulmonary embolism between the treatment arms. 
There was no meaningful difference in the rate of patients with AEs within the SMQ thromboembolic events 
between the treatment arms of all patients in trial 1199.13, or patients with adenocarcinoma in trial 1199.14. 
There was no indication of a difference between the dose groups in the frequency of patients with 
thromboembolic events in nintedanib monotherapy phase I/II trials. The overall frequency of patients with 
thromboembolic events was 4.9% of patients with cancer treated with nintedanib (including 2.9% of patients 
with AEs within the SMQ venous thromboembolism, and 0.8% of patients with AEs within the AESI term arterial 
thromboembolism). 
The number of patients with grade 5 thromboembolic events in SAF-1 was small and balanced across treatment 
arms. In the 1199.13 adenocarcinoma population there was 1 (0.3%) patient on placebo and 3 (0.9%) patients 
on nintedanib who developed a fatal thromboembolic event. In all patients in 1199.13 there were 4 (0.6%) 
patients on placebo and 5 (0.8%) patients on nintedanib. In the 1199.14 adenocarcinoma population there were 
no patients on placebo and 1 (0.3%) patient on nintedanib who had a fatal thromboembolic event.

Perforation (gastro-intestinal and non-gastro intestinal) 
In patients with adenocarcinoma in trial 1199.13, the frequency of patients with AEs within the SSC 
gastrointestinal perforation (0.3% in each treatment arm) and in the SSC non-gastrointestinal perforation 
(1.3% nintedanib; 0.3% placebo) was low. The reported AEs in the SSC non-gastrointestinal perforation did not 
include any perforation, however 4 patients in the nintedanib arm, and 1 patient in the placebo arm experienced 
an abscess located in the lung or chest wall. Some of the abscesses were associated with tumour-related 
conditions or with myelosupression. The reported abscesses were not regarded as precursors or consequences 
of a perforation. 
Sepsis 
Sepsis was more frequent in the nintedanib arm (1.5%, n=10) than in the placebo arm (0.6%, n=4) of pivotal 
trial 1199.13 (all patients, study1199.13). 7/10 AEs of sepsis in the nintedanib arm, and 1/4 AEs of sepsis in the 
placebo arm were fatal. 3/7 patients with fatal sepsis in the nintedanib arm also had neutropenia.  
The proportion of patients in the adenocarcinoma population for which sepsis was reported was: placebo 0.6% 
(2/333) vs nintedanib 1.3% (4/320). Concerning SAF-2 (nintedanib monotherapy), sepsis was only registered 
in 1 patient (0.6%) with a starting dose ≤200 mg b.i.d. and not in any patients with a starting dose >200 mg 
b.i.d. 
In the overall population (all severity grades), the median time to the first onset for patients developing sepsis 
was: 59 days placebo (49, 68 days; P25% 75%) vs 49 days nintedanib (29,52 days; P25% 75%)]. These results 
were consistent for the adenocarcinoma population (all severity grades). The median duration of sepsis in the 
nintedanib arm was 3.5 days in the overall population and 4.5 days in the adenocarcinoma population. The 
median time for onset of sepsis was cycle 3 or 4 of chemotherapy administration. 
Six of the 11 drug-related fatal events in the nintedanib arm were due to sepsis (n=3), septic shock (n=2) or 
neutropenic infection (n=1). The drug-related fatal AEs of sepsis, septic shock and neutropenic infection 
occurred in patients with advanced second-line metastatic NSCLC in the context of concomitant docetaxel use, 
a known myelotoxic agent. Two patients had concomitant neutropenia and in two additional patients 
neutropenia might have played a role. Apart from the relationship to neutropenia (and concomitant docetaxel 
use) no other modifiable risk factor was identified (see also section on serious adverse events/deaths).

Neutropenia 
Table 49: Patients with neutropenia (based on AEs within the SSC or laboratory values), febrile neutropenia 
(SSC), infection (SSC), or sepsis (SSC) in the treatment period/ TS – all patients (Study 1199.13) 
Three patients (0.5%) in the placebo arm experienced a CTCAE grade 4 AE of infection compared to five patients 
(0.8%) in the nintedanib arm. All patients with a CTCAE grade 4 infection recovered except for three patients in 
the nintedanib arm that had an unknown outcome. Of the three patients with an unknown outcome two patients 
experienced a fatal AE of respiratory failure and the third patient experienced a fatal AE of neutropenic infection. 
The fatal events were temporally related to the grade 4 infection AEs. Seventeen patients (2.6%) in the placebo 
arm compared to 29 patients (4.4%) in the nintedanib arm experienced a CTCAE grade 4 AE of febrile 
neutropenia. All patients with a CTCAE grade 4 AE of febrile neutropenia recovered. 
Overall, of the 178 patients with an AE within the infections and infestations SOC in the nintedanib arm, five 
patients had a CTCAE grade 4 AE. The AEs of infection resolved in two patients. In the remaining three patients, 
the outcome of the grade 4 infections was unknown but the patients developed concomitant fatal AEs of 
respiratory failure and neutropenic infection.  
Cutaneous adverse reactions  
There were no grade 5 events of cutaneous serious skin reactions or rash in the nintedanib arm of study 
1199.13.  
Adverse events within the special MedDRA query (SMQ) cutaneous serious skin reactions occurred in 10.7% of 
the patients treated with placebo and 13.0% of the patients treated with nintedanib. Stomatitis was the most 
reported preferred term (PT) and accounted for the majority of events in the SMQ cutaneous serious skin 
reactions (placebo 8.7% vs. nintedanib 9.7%). There were no grade 5 events in the SMQ cutaneous serious skin 
reactions and few patients had grade 3 or 4 events in the SMQ cutaneous serious skin reactions (placebo 0.5% 
vs. nintedanib 0.8%); all represented events of stomatitis (including an event on placebo with a PT of mouth 
ulceration). 
Cutaneous serious skin reactions not associated with stomatitis in the nintedanib group were primarily 
attributable to reports of exfoliative rash. All cases of exfoliative rash were of grade 1 or 2. None of the patients 
experienced Stevens Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 105/138 
 
  
  
 
 
Adverse events within the special search category of rash occurred in 8.1% of the patients treated with placebo 
and 11.0% of the patients treated with nintedanib. The vast majority of patients had events of grade 1 or 2 in 
severity in both arms. The PTs rash, dermatitis acneiform, exfoliative rash, erythema, skin ulcer and dermatitis 
were the most reported events in both arms and were all of grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
Mucositis  
The special search category (SSC) of mucositis overlapped with the SMQ cutaneous serious skin reactions as 
both included the term stomatitis. Similar to what was seen with the SMQ cutaneous serious skin reactions, 
stomatitis was responsible for the majority of events in the SMQ mucositis. 
In study 1199.13, AEs in the SSC mucositis were slightly more frequent in the nintedanib arm than in the 
placebo arm (AEs of any grade and CTCAE grade ≥3) with a slightly more pronounced difference between the 
treatment arms in patients with adenocarcinoma. No obvious risk factors for the development of mucositis could 
be identified in study 1199.13. Stomatitis was the most frequently reported AE in the SSC mucositis and is a 
known adverse drug reaction of docetaxel and of other angiogenesis inhibitors.  
Peripheral neuropathy 
In the overall population of study 1199.13, AEs in the SSC peripheral neuropathy were balanced between the 
treatment arms; however, in patients with adenocarcinoma they were slightly more frequent in the nintedanib 
arm than in the placebo arm (AEs of any grade and of CTCAE grade ≥3). Peripheral neuropathy is a known 
adverse drug reaction of docetaxel and also of other angiogenesis inhibitors. AEs in the SSC peripheral 
neuropathy were also reported in patients who received nintedanib monotherapy; however, some of these 
patients may have had pre-existing neuropathy from prior anti-cancer therapy. In study 1199.13 (overall 
population and patients with adenocarcinoma) no risk factor for the development of peripheral neuropathy 
under treatment with nintedanib in combination with docetaxel could be identified.  
Hypertension 
The overall frequency of patients with AEs within the SMQ hypertension was lower than expected from other 
VEGFR inhibitors but was more frequent in the nintedanib arm than in the placebo arm in patients with 
adenocarcinoma in trial 1199.13 (3.4% nintedanib; 0.6% placebo). The AEs were mostly of grade 1 or 2. 
Cardiac events 
Cardiac failure 
Regarding pivotal trial 1199.13 (all patients), the most common PT in both treatment arms was oedema 
peripheral (5.5% vs. 6.4%). 
Cardiac arrhythmias 
In pivotal trial 1199.13 (all patients) cardiac arrhythmias were more common in the nintedanib arm (10.3%) 
than in the placebo arm (8.7%). In the adenocarcinoma patients, cardiac arrhythmias were also more common 
in the nintedanib arm (11.6%) than in the placebo arm (7.5%). However, in spite of higher frequency of cardiac 
arrhythmias in nintedanib treated patients, other cardiac events occurred at comparable rates in both treatment 
arms. The most common PT within the SMQ cardiac arrhythmias in trial 1199.13 (all patients) were atrial 
fibrillation (nintedanib arm: 2.3% vs. placebo arm: 1.4%), sinus tachycardia (1.7% vs. 1.2%) and tachycardia 
(1.2% vs. 0.8%). ECG was performed at screening, start of each treatment cycle (before treatment) and at end 
of treatment (EOT).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014

No QT prolongation was observed for nintedanib in the clinical trial program. Potential QT interval prolongation 
was assessed in phase II trial 1199.26 (patients with renal cell carcinoma receiving nintedanib monotherapy). 
No QT prolongation was identified during 15 days of exposure to nintedanib. 
Immunological events 
In the pivotal trial 1199.13, concomitant chemotherapy consisted of docetaxel which is known to cause very 
common immunological adverse events such hypersensitivity (grade 3 and 4 AE 5.3%). In study 1199.13, 
overall incidence of patients with anaphylactic reactions was comparable between the nintedanib group and the 
placebo group in both the overall population (nintedanib: 0.2% vs. placebo: 0.5%) and the adenocarcinoma 
population (nintedanib 0% vs. placebo 0.3%). 
The overall frequency of patients with preferred terms from the system organ class immune system disorders 
was numerically lower in the nintedanib group as compared to the placebo group. This was applicable for both 
the overall population (nintedanib 1.8% vs. placebo 2.3) and the adenocarcinoma population (nintedanib 2.5% 
vs. placebo 3.3%). The vast majority of the immunological events were non-life-threatening. There were only 
single cases of grade 4 severity and there were no fatal cases. 
Pneumonitis and reduction in LVEF 
The overall percentage of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) in the 1199.13 trial was low and below the 
threshold  of  ILD  incidence  reported  in  NSCLC  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy.  Although  LVEF  was  not 
routinely measured in the 1199.13 trial, the two preferred terms “ejection fraction decreased” and “low cardiac 
output syndrome”, which are considered indicative for reduced LVEF were not reported for nintedanib-treated 
patients in this trial. Similarly low findings of ILD or ejection fraction decreased were observed in the overall 
population of cancer patients exposed to nintedanib (SAF-3). 
Overdose 
The most frequent AEs reported at higher doses of nintedanib (>200 mg b.i.d.) were effects on the 
gastrointestinal system (diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain) and liver-related investigation. In most cases, AEs 
were reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation of nintedanib treatment, and administration of 
appropriate concomitant medication. In summary, nintedanib doses >200 mg increased the frequencies of the 
most common AEs which were also observed at doses ≤200 mg b.i.d.; no additional nintedanib-related AEs were 
identified in the high-dose group. 
The highest dose of nintedanib applied in systematic phase I trials was 450 mg q.d. The BI safety database of 
nintedanib was searched for any cases of accidental overdose and for any AEs associated with a nintedanib 
overdose. Overall, 2 patients were treated erroneously with doses higher than the recommended dose of 200 
mg b.i.d (overdose of maximum 600 mg bid up to eight days). AE occurred consistent with the known safety 
profile of nintedanib, i.e. increased liver enzymes and gastrointestinal symptoms. All patients recovered from 
these AEs. 
Adverse drug reactions 
Adverse drug reactions were identified comparing treatment with nintedanib plus docetaxel against placebo plus 
docetaxel in patients with locally advanced, or metastatic based on the global, double-blind randomised pivotal 
phase 3 trial 1199.13 (LUME-Lung 1). Criteria taken into account were (1) relative increase in adverse event 
frequency over control arm, (2) consistent trend across clinical studies, (3) known class effects, (4) compatible

temporal association, (5) positive dose-response relationship, and (6) biological plausibility (adverse 
mechanism). 
Adverse drug reactions are presented in the table below.

Deaths 
Table 53: Summary of exposure – treated set (1199.13, all patients and adenocarcinoma) 
The main analysis of AEs leading to death was restricted to those fatal AEs with an onset date or worsening 
during study treatment or up to 28 days after permanent discontinuation of last study medication. 
Table 54: Adverse events leading to death in patients with adenocarcinoma in phase III trials 1199.13 
(incidence >1 patient overall) – by preferred term 
A Kaplan-Meier analysis of the patients who experienced AEs leading to death on treatment showed a trend for 
an overall survival improvement in the nintedanib arm (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI: 0.47, 1.22, median overall 
survival 3.6 months nintedanib; 2.5 months placebo).

More patients in the nintedanib than in the placebo arm died because of an AE which was not attributed to PD 
(placebo:  8  out  of  32  patients,  25.0%;  nintedanib:  20  out  of  56  patients,  35.7%).  After  adjustment 
for exposure, the incidence rate ratio of nintedanib vs. placebo for fatal AEs was 2.29 (95% CI 1.01, 5.21) in the 
adenocarcinoma population and 1.18 (95%CI 0.86, 1.62) in overall patient population.

and adenocarcinoma patient in study 1199.13 are summarised below.

Table 57: Deaths without attribution to PD (using death date) - treated set (all patients and adenocarcinoma) 
When the observation time was extended to during treatment +90 days, 19 (5.7%) placebo patients and 32 
(10.0%) nintedanib patients had a non-PD death (adenocarcinoma population). Thus, 11 additional deaths on 
placebo and 13 additional deaths on nintedanib were observed beyond 28 days but ≤90 days post-treatment. 
These additional deaths were collected as outcome measures in the CRF as they occurred after the end of the 
residual effect period of 28 days. A review of these deaths revealed no further safety signals. The 11 additional 
deaths that occurred on placebo were deaths of ‘unknown cause’. The 13 additional deaths that occurred on 
nintedanib included 8 deaths of ‘unknown cause’, 2 due to AEs (interstitial lung disease [described as induced by 
erlotinib] and ischaemic stroke), and 3 deaths due to ‘other reason’ (an event of ‘gangrene of feet’, an event of 
‘natural cause’ and an event of ‘respiratory failure’). 
The  result  of  the  review  of  all  non-PD  deaths  during  treatment  or  ≤90  days  post-treatment  and  >90  days 
post-treatment for both all patients and adenocarcinoma patient in study 1199.13 did not reveal any new risks 
or pattern suggestive of delayed toxicity which could have compromised the survival benefit for patients treated 
with nintedanib. 
A time at risk adjusted analysis that captured all deaths of entire observation period was also performed.

Table 58: Time at risk adjusted analysis of all deaths and incidence rate ratio – treated set (all patients and 
adenocarcinoma) 
Respiratory Failure 
In all patients in 1199.13 there were 4 fatal non-PD events of respiratory failure in the nintedanib arm and none 
in the placebo arm. The events of respiratory failure had different underlying etiologies. All events of respiratory 
failure  had  a  short  clinical  course  of  24  hours  from  time  of  onset  to  death.  A  review  of  the  individual  case 
narratives revealed no discernible pattern in terms of clinical picture, time to onset of the events, age, baseline 
medical  conditions,  or  concomitant  medications.  In  addition  all  4  events  of  fatal  respiratory  failure  were 
determined to be unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. 
Sepsis 
An imbalance in the events of fatal sepsis/septic shock was observed with 7  patients in the nintedanib arm 
versus 1 patient in the placebo arm. A review of the patients with fatal non-PD sepsis/septic shock revealed that 
3 of the patients experienced concomitant neutropenia. Neutropenia might have played a role in 2 additional 
patients. Otherwise the review of the events of sepsis/ septic shock revealed no discernible pattern in terms of 
age, gender, race, or time to onset. Overall, in 2 of the 7 cases, insufficient information was provided to support 
the diagnosis of sepsis. Furthermore 2 cases occurred after only 3-5 days of treatment with nintedanib. 
Myelotoxicity (including neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and sepsis) is a known side effect of treatment with 
docetaxel. In the pivotal study 1199.13 there was an increase in neutropenia based on laboratory values (all 
grades: placebo: 68.2% vs. nintedanib: 74.1%; grade 3 and 4: 50.1% vs. 56.1%) when combining nintedanib 
with docetaxel compared with combining placebo with docetaxel. The percentage of patients with AEs within the 
special search category (SSC) febrile neutropenia was also greater in the nintedanib arm when compared to the 
placebo arm (placebo: 4.9% vs. nintedanib: 7.4%). 
Laboratory findings 
Blood samples for the assessment of haematology, biochemistry, and coagulation parameters were to be 
collected at all scheduled visits. At unscheduled visits, blood samples were only to be collected if additional tests 
were deemed necessary. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014 
Page 113/138 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Urine samples were to be collected at screening, at the first visit of each treatment course, and at EOT, or if 
deemed necessary. 
Liver parameters 
The proportion of patients with elevated AST, ALT, ALKP, or total bilirubin was higher in the nintedanib arm 
(approximately 1.6 to 2 fold, all grades combined) than in the placebo arm. The elevations in these liver 
parameters were mostly of CTCAE grade 1 or 2 and were reversible in the majority of patients by the time of the 
data cut-off. These findings were consistent with the analyses for the AESI liver-related investigation. 
Haematology parameters 
Low white blood cell, platelet, or neutrophil counts were slightly more frequent in the nintedanib arm (up to 
approximately 1.3 fold for low platelet count, all grades combined) than in the placebo arm. These changes were 
reversible in the majority of patients. In line with the laboratory evaluations, the analyses for the AESIs showed 
slight increases in the proportion of patients reported with infection in the nintedanib arm. 
Thyroid parameters 
Treatment with nintedanib did not result in notable changes in thyroid laboratory parameters. 
Coagulation other biochemistry parameters 
In the nintedanib arm, the frequency of abnormal aPTT (approximately 1.3 fold; mostly of CTCAE grade 1 or 2) 
or electrolyte imbalances (up to approximately 1.6 fold for hypernatraemia, all grades combined) was slightly 
higher than in the placebo arm. These changes were reversible in the majority of patients. 
Table 59: Coagulation and other biochemistry parameters in patients with adenocarcinoma in pivotal phase III 
trial 1199.13 by worst CTCAE grade on treatment - TS 
Very few patients experienced hyperphosphatemia. 
Urinalysis 
Urinalysis was performed by dipstick test. The parameters urine protein, pH, nitrite, glucose, RBC, and WBC 
were assessed according to worst value on treatment and transitions during the course of the study. No 
meaningful difference was seen between the two treatment arms in pivotal study 1199.13 (all patients).

Safety in special populations 
Age 
The  proportion  of  patients  ≥  65  years  old  was  balanced  across  treatment  arms  in  both  the  overall  and  the 
adenocarcinoma  populations  of  1199.13  (overall  population:  placebo  32.4%  vs.  nintedanib  30.7%; 
adenocarcinoma population: placebo 28.2% vs. nintedanib 28.1%). The proportion of patients experiencing AEs 
was balanced across age groups in both treatment arms in the overall and adenocarcinoma populations. 
Patients ≥65 years old experienced more events in the SSC cardiac arrhythmias when compared to patients <65 
years old regardless of randomization to placebo or nintedanib. This was seen in both the overall (placebo: <65 
years: 7.4% vs. ≥65 years: 11.3%, nintedanib: <65 years 7.3% vs. ≥65 years: 17.0%) and adenocarcinoma 
populations (placebo: <65 years: 5.9% vs. ≥65 years: 11.7%, nintedanib: <65 years: 7.8% vs. ≥65 years: 
21.1%). 
While patients ≥65 years old experienced more events in the sensitive SSC cardiac failure when compared to 
patients <65 years old in the both arms [in the overall population (placebo: < 65 years: 5.6% vs. ≥65 years: 
9.9%, nintedanib: <65 years: 5.5% vs. ≥65 years: 9.0%) and in the nintedanib arm of the adenocarcinoma 
population  (placebo:  <65  years:  6.7%  vs.  ≥65  years:  6.4%,  nintedanib:  <65  years:  5.7%  vs.  ≥65  years: 
13.3%)], there was no imbalance in the more specific SSC of cardiac failure tailored [in the overall population 
(placebo: < 65 years: 0.5% vs. ≥65 years: 1.4%, nintedanib: <65 years: 0.7% vs. ≥65 years: 1.0%) and in the 
nintedanib arm of the adenocarcinoma population (placebo: <65 years: 0 vs. ≥65 years: 2.1%, nintedanib: <65 
years: 0 vs. ≥65 years: 0)].

Overall  safety  profile  was  similar  across  age  groups  in  both  treatment  arms  in  both  the  overall  and 
adenocarcinoma populations. 
Gender 
The proportion of female patients was balanced across treatment arms in both the overall and the 
adenocarcinoma populations of 1199.13 (overall population: placebo 27.0% vs. nintedanib 27.5%; 
adenocarcinoma population: placebo 37.8% vs. nintedanib 37.2%). The proportion of patients experiencing AEs 
was balanced across both genders in both treatment arms in the overall and adenocarcinoma populations. 
Females in the nintedanib arm, in both the overall and adenocarcinoma populations, were more likely to 
experience adverse events belonging to the SSC of liver related investigations (overall population: male 26.4% 
vs. female 52.5%; adenocarcinoma population: male 32.3% vs. female 60.5%) and tailored liver related 
investigations (overall population: male 24.3% vs. female 49.7%; adenocarcinoma population: male 30.8% vs. 
female 57.1%) when compared to males. Otherwise the overall safety profile was similar across gender in both 
treatment arms in both the overall and adenocarcinoma populations. 
Race 
The proportion of Asian patients was balanced across treatment arms in both the overall and the 
adenocarcinoma populations of 1199.13 (overall population: placebo 18.9% vs. nintedanib 18.1%; 
adenocarcinoma population: placebo 23.7% vs. nintedanib 20.6%). The proportion of Asian patients with AEs in 
the nintedanib arm was similar across arms in the adenocarcinoma (placebo 88.6% vs. nintedanib 97.0%) and 
overall populations (placebo 91.1% vs. nintedanib 94.1%). 
Asian patients in both the placebo and nintedanib arms experienced more events in the SSC of liver related 
investigations in the overall population (placebo: Non-Asians 11.3% vs. Asians 23.4%, nintedanib: Non-Asians 
27.3% vs. Asians 61.9%) and the adenocarcinoma populations (placebo: Non-Asians 10.6% vs. Asians 27.8%, 
nintedanib: Non-Asians 34.6% vs. Asians 74.2%) when compared to Non-Asians. A similar finding was observed 
with AEs in the SSC of tailored liver related investigations. Otherwise the overall safety profile was similar 
among Asians and Non-Asians in both treatment arms in the overall and adenocarcinoma populations.

Weight 
The majority of patients in 1199.13 weighed 50 kg to <90 kg. The number of patients weighing <50 kg was 
small but balanced across treatment arms in both the overall [placebo 34 patients (5.2%) vs. nintedanib 32 
patients (4.9%)] and adenocarcinoma [placebo 20 patients (6.0%) vs. nintedanib 17 patients (5.3%)] 
populations. The number of patients weighing ≥90 kg was small but balanced across treatment arms in both the 
overall [placebo 75 patients (11.5%) vs. nintedanib 72 patients (11.0%)] and adenocarcinoma [placebo 34 
patients (10.2%) vs. nintedanib 31 patients (9.7%)] populations. Overall the proportion of patients with AEs in 
all weight groups across treatment arms was balanced in the overall and adenocarcinoma populations. The 
safety profile across patients in the 50 to <70 kg and the 70 to <90 kg weight categories was comparable. The 
number of patients in the <50 kg and >90 kg weight categories was too small to allow for a meaningful safety 
analysis across these weight categories. 
Body Surface Area (BSA)  
There was a small proportion of patients with a BSA <1.5 m2 in both the overall and the adenocarcinoma 
populations of 1199.13 (overall population: placebo 7.2% vs. nintedanib 6.0%; adenocarcinoma population: 
placebo 8.4% vs. nintedanib 7.5%). The number of patients with a BSA <1.5m2 was too small to allow for a 
meaningful safety analysis across weight categories. 
ECOG Performance Score (PS)  
ECOG performance score was a stratification factor in study 1199.13. The majority of patients in the trial had an 
ECOG PS of 1. The proportion of patients with an ECOG PS of 0 and 1 was balanced across treatment arms in 
both the overall and the adenocarcinoma populations of 1199.13 (ECOG PS of 0: overall population: placebo 
28.4% vs. nintedanib 28.7%; adenocarcinoma population: placebo 28.8% vs. nintedanib 30.0%). 
No  significant  difference  in  the  AE  profile  was  observed  among  patients  with  an  ECOG  PS  of  0  or  1  among 
treatment  arms  in  both  the  overall  and  adenocarcinoma  populations  of  1199.13.  Although  patients  with  a 
baseline  ECOG  PS  of  1  in  the  nintedanib  arm  experienced  slightly  more  events  in  the  SSC  of  liver  related 
investigations  in  the  overall  population  (ECOG  PS  of  0:  27.3%  vs.  ECOG  PS  of  1:  36.1%)  and  the 
adenocarcinoma populations (ECOG PS of 0: 35.4% vs. ECOG PS of 1: 46.0%) when compared to patients with 
baseline ECOG PS of 0. A similar finding was observed with AEs in the SSC of tailored liver related investigations. 
Brain Metastasis  
Brain metastasis was a stratification factor in study 1199.13 and only patients with non-active brain metastasis 
were allowed into the trial. The majority of patients in the trial did not have brain metastasis. The proportion of 
patients with brain metastasis was small and balanced across treatment arms in both the overall and the 
adenocarcinoma populations of 1199.13 (overall population: placebo 5.8% vs. nintedanib 5.8%; 
adenocarcinoma population: placebo 6.9% vs. nintedanib 8.1%). 
No significant difference in the AE profile was observed among patients with and without brain metastasis 
among treatment arms in both the overall and adenocarcinoma populations of 1199.13. A few patients with 
brain metastasis in the nintedanib arm experienced events of bleeding (overall population: placebo 4 patients 
vs. nintedanib 2 patients; adenocarcinoma population: placebo 2 patients vs. nintedanib 2 patients). All events 
of bleeding were respiratory in nature and there were no events of CNS bleeding.

Hepatic impairment 
A small number of patients with baseline hepatic impairment were included in 1199.13 (overall population: 
placebo 14.4% vs. nintedanib 10.7%; adenocarcinoma population: placebo 13.2% vs. nintedanib 10.9%). 
There were slightly more patients with hepatic impairment in the placebo arm than in the nintedanib arm. All 
patients with hepatic impairment had mild hepatic impairment (ULN< AST and/or ALT ≤2.5 x ULN and/or ULN< 
total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN) except for 2 patients in the nintedanib arm that had moderate hepatic impairment 
(2.5 x ULN <AST and/or ALT≤5 x ULN and/or 1.5 x ULN < total bilirubin ≤3 x ULN). 
Overall patients with normal hepatic function and those with mild hepatic impairment experienced a comparable 
number of AEs in the overall and adenocarcinoma across both treatment arms. Patients with mild hepatic 
impairment in both the placebo and nintedanib arms experienced more events in the SSC of liver related 
investigations in the overall population (placebo: normal hepatic function 12.0% vs. mild hepatic impairment 
24.2%, nintedanib: normal hepatic function 32.1% vs. mild hepatic impairment 44.1%) and the 
adenocarcinoma populations (placebo: normal hepatic function 13.9% vs. mild hepatic impairment 20.5%, 
nintedanib: normal hepatic function 40.7% vs. mild hepatic impairment 57.6%) when compared to patients with 
baseline normal hepatic function. A similar finding was observed with AEs in the SSC of tailored liver related 
investigations. 
Renal Impairment  
Only four patients with baseline renal impairment (creatinine level ≥1.5 x ULN) were treated in 1199.13 (3 
patients were in the placebo arm and 1 patient was in the nintedanib arm). Therefore no conclusions could be 
made regarding the safety profile of these patients.  
Geographical Region  
Patients in 1199.13 were categorised into two major geographic regions; Asia and non-Asia. The majority of 
patients were from Non-Asia [placebo (76.3%) and nintedanib (76.7%)]. The proportion of patients from Asia 
and non-Asia was balanced across treatment arms. The proportion of patients with AEs was comparable across 
both geographical regions (Asia and non-Asia) and treatment arms in both the overall and adenocarcinoma 
populations. Patients from Asia in both the placebo and nintedanib arms experienced more events in the SSC of 
liver related investigations in both the overall population (placebo: Non-Asia 10.8% vs. Asia 22.6%, nintedanib: 
Non-Asia 27.4% vs. Asia 53.9%) and the adenocarcinoma populations (placebo: Non-Asia 10.1% vs. Asia 
26.3%, nintedanib: Non-Asia 35.0% vs. Asia 64.0%) than patients from Europe. A similar finding was observed 
with AEs in the SSC of tailored liver related investigations. 
Smoking Status  
The majority of patients in 1199.13 were current smokers/ ex-smokers in both the overall and adenocarcinoma 
populations (current smokers/ex-smokers: overall population: placebo 75.6% vs. nintedanib 74.7%; 
adenocarcinoma population: placebo 65.8% vs. nintedanib 64.1%). The remaining patients were never 
smokers. 
The proportion of patients experiencing AEs was comparable in never smokers and current/ex-smokers across 
treatment arms in both the overall and adenocarcinoma populations. Never smokers in the nintedanib arm were 
more likely to experience adverse events belonging to the SSC of liver related investigations in the overall 
(current smoker/ex-smoker 26.3% vs. never smoked 55.2%) and adenocarcinoma populations (current 
smoker/ex-smoker 30.7% vs. never smoked 64.3%) than patients in the placebo arm. A similar finding was 
observed with AEs in the SSC of tailored liver related investigations.

Adverse events in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and “other” histologies (pivotal trial 
1199.13) 
Squamous cell carcinoma 
AEs of any grade (nintedanib arm: 90.5% vs. placebo arm: 90.6%) and grade ≥3 AEs (66.5% vs. 58.6%) 
occurred at slightly lower frequencies in patients with squamous cell carcinoma than in “all” patients (93.6% vs. 
93.0% and 71.3% vs. 64.3%). Overall, the most commonly reported AEs were the same in patient with 
squamous cell carcinoma as in patients with adenocarcinoma and “all” patients.  However, liver-related 
investigations were less common in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (22.9% vs. 11.9%) than in all 
patients in the trial (33.6% vs. 13.6%), and bleeding was more frequent in the patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma (17.1% vs. 10.8%) than in “all” patients in the trial (14.1% vs. 11.6%). Moreover, coagulation 
abnormalities were also slightly more frequent in the patients with squamous cell carcinoma [increased 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (37.4% vs. 29%) and increased international normalised ratio 
(INR) (36.2% vs. 34.6%)], than in all patients in the trial [aPTT (35% vs. 27.8%) and increased INR (31.5% vs. 
31.1%)]. 
In patients with squamous cell carcinoma SAEs (nintedanib arm: 32.7% vs. placebo arm: 32.0%) occurred at 
similar rates as in all patients in pivotal trial 1199.13. Concerning fatal events, comparable frequencies between 
the two treatment arms were observed in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (13.5% vs. 14.7%), which 
differed from all patients in the trial where fatal events were more frequent in the nintedanib arm than in the 
placebo arm (16.4% vs. 11.8%). Discontinuations were slightly more common in the placebo arm (26.6%) than 
in the nintedanib arm (23.3%) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, which is slightly different to all patients 
in the trial where comparable frequencies were observed (22.7% vs. 21.7%). 
Although bleeding was more common in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the overall safety profile for 
patients with SCC appears to be comparable to all patients in the trial. 
“Other” histologies 
Due to the small number of patients with “other” histologies in pivotal trial 1199.13 (nintedanib arm: 57, 
placebo arm: 45) it is not feasible to draw firm conclusions concerning the frequencies of different AEs.Both AEs 
of any grade (nintedanib arm: 93.0% vs. placebo arm: 97.7%) and grade ≥3 AEs (68.4% vs. 68.2%) occurred 
at similar frequencies as in all patients in the trial. In contrary to all patients where SAEs were moderately more 
common in the nintedanib arm (34.4%) than in the placebo arm (31.5%), a substantially higher frequency of 
SAEs were observed in the nintedanib arm (40.4%) than in the placebo arm (22.7%) of patients harbouring 
“other” histologies. Similarly, fatal events were more frequent in patients with “other” histologies (26.4% vs. 
9.1%) than in all patients in the trial (16.4% vs. 11.8%). Moreover, discontinuations occurred at comparable 
frequencies between the nintedanib arm (22.7%) and placebo arm (21.7%) in all patients in the trial. In 
contrary, discontinuations were more common in the nintedanib arm (29.8%) than in the placebo arm (20.5%) 
of patients with “other” histologies. Increased frequencies of SAEs, fatal events and discontinuations were 
observed in patients with “other” histologies.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The  phase  I  dose  escalation  trial  1199.4  investigated  escalating  doses  of  nintedanib  in  combination  with 
docetaxel  in  patients  with  prostate  cancer.  There  was  no  indication  of  a  clinically  relevant  pharmacokinetic 
interaction between nintedanib (doses ranged from 100 mg b.i.d. to 250 mg b.i.d.) and docetaxel (single dose 
of 75 mg/m²). The AE profile was similar to that in the phase I nintedanib monotherapy dose escalation studies, 
except  for  the  chemotherapy-related  side  effects.  There  was  no  indication  that  nintedanib  exacerbated  side 
effects commonly seen with docetaxel. 
The combination of escalating doses of nintedanib with pemetrexed was investigated in patients with NSCLC in 
the  phase  I  dose  escalation  trials  1199.18  and  1199.28  (in  Japanese  patients).  No  clinically  relevant 
pharmacokinetic interaction between nintedanib and pemetrexed was observed. The nintedanib doses ranged 
from 100 mg b.i.d. to 200 mg b.i.d. (1199.28) and 250 mg b.i.d. (1199.18); pemetrexed was administered at 
500 mg/m2 in both studies. No adverse drug reactions in addition to the individual safety profiles of nintedanib 
and pemetrexed were identified. 
Trials 1199.5 and 1199.6 investigated the combination of nintedanib with carboplatin and paclitaxel and trial 
1199.51  the  combination  with  mFOLFOX6  (oxaliplatin,  5-fluorouracil,  and  leucovorin).  No  clinically  relevant 
pharmacokinetic alterations were observed. These studies revealed that 200 mg b.i.d. of nintedanib could be 
safely  combined  with  standard  doses  of  the  chemotherapies.  The  AE  profile  was  similar  to  that  in  phase  I 
nintedanib monotherapy dose escalation studies, except for the chemotherapy-related toxicities.

In study 1199.14, dose reductions of nintedanib/placebo were more common in the nintedanib arm (33.2%) 
than in the placebo arm (9.6%). More patients in the nintedanib arm (34.3%) than in the placebo arm (11.1%) 
also had at least 1 dose reduction of pemetrexed. 
Discontinuations 
The analysis of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the last study medication included patients who 
discontinued treatment with combination therapy and did not continue with monotherapy, patients who 
discontinued monotherapy with nintedanib/placebo (after having earlier discontinued the cytostatic component 
of the combination therapy), and patients who discontinued monotherapy with cytostatic (after having earlier 
discontinued the nintedanib/placebo component). Patients with AEs leading to discontinuation of one 
component of the study medication (nintedanib/placebo or cytostatic) were not included in the analysis if they 
continued to take the other component of the study medication.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data from 35 completed trials were pooled into four safety analysis sets (SAFs), SAF-1 to 4 which is 
considered meaningful. This provides the basis for a robust assessment of the safety profile of nintedanib.  
Safety assessment was primarily based on pivotal trial 1199.13 which compared treatment with 
nintedanib/docetaxel (n=652) to placebo/docetaxel (n=655). Patients were exposed to nintedanib in a sufficient 
timeframe when considering the nature of their disease.  
Regarding exposure to nintedanib/placebo in pivotal trial 1199.13 (all patients), mean duration of 
nintedanib/placebo treatment was 4.78 months in the nintedanib arm and 4.17 months in the placebo arm. For 
patients with adenocarcinoma a slightly longer treatment time was observed in both the nintedanib arm (5.45 
months) and placebo arm (4.70 months). Exposure to docetaxel, judged by mean docetaxel courses and 
cumulative dose was greater in the nintedanib arm than in the placebo arm of pivotal trial 1199.13 (all patients). 
Moreover, higher docetaxel exposure was observed in patients with adenocarcinoma histology. However, these 
differences observed in exposure are unlikely to have a major impact on the AEs reported in the two treatment 
arms. Moreover, the higher exposure to docetaxel observed in the nintedanib arm of pivotal trial 1199.13 
indicated that co-administration of nintedanib/docetaxel may be performed without reducing concomitant 
docetaxel treatment, suggesting tolerability of the concomitant treatment.

In general, there were more AEs reported in the nintedanib arm, which is expected. Patients in the placebo arm 
had a higher frequency of Grade 1/2 AEs, while patients in the nintedanib arm were more likely to experience 
Grade 3/4/5 AEs, where the most common AEs were: liver enzyme elevations, decreased WBC and neutrophils, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea and neutropenia. The decreased levels of WBC and neutrophils led to slightly more 
infections in the nintedanib arm. Slightly more cases of sepsis were also observed in the nintedanib arm. With 
regard to the Grade 1/2 more patients experienced, diarrhoea, ALT elevations, AST elevations, nausea, 
decreased appetite, and vomiting in the nintedanib in combination with docetaxel arm.  
In relation to Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) the Applicant has investigated this issue from several 
viewpoints: AESI related to bevacizumab (only VEGF inhibitor approved for the treatment of NSCLC), AESI 
related to VEGF inhibitors in general, and AESI related to docetaxel. Overall, there were some AESI that 
occurred more frequently than others: diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and liver-related AEs.  
Diarrhoea was the most frequently reported gastro-intestinal adverse reaction and appeared in close temporary 
relationship with the administration of chemotherapy (docetaxel). Diarrhoea was more frequent in the 
nintedanib arm (42.3%) than in the placebo arm (21.8%) of pivotal trial 1199.13 (all patients) and was also the 
most common reason for dose reductions in the trial. The majority of patients experienced diarrhoea of mild to 
moderate severity. In the adenocarcinoma population, diarrhoea occurred in 43.4 % (≥ grade 3: 6.3 %) of in 
the nintedanib arm. Nevertheless, as the majority of patients had recovered by the time of data cut-off 
(nintedanib arm: 264/276), placebo arm: 139/143), diarrhoea appears to be manageable with dose reductions 
and supportive treatments. Therefore, diarrhoea should be treated at first signs with adequate hydration and 
anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products, for example loperamide, and may require interruption, dose reduction or 
discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib. The dose reduction scheme (i.e. after treatment interruption and 
recovery to grade 1 or baseline, dose reduction from 200 mg twice daily to 150 mg twice daily and if a 2nd dose 
reduction is necessary, from 150 mg twice daily to 100 mg twice daily) in case of diarrhoea ≥ grade 2 for more 
than 7 consecutive days despite anti-diarrhoeal treatment or diarrhoea ≥grade 3 despite anti-diarrhoeal 
treatment, is regarded to provide adequate guidance in order to control diarrhoea and associated complications 
(see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). 
Nausea and vomiting, mostly of mild to moderate severity, were frequently reported gastrointestinal adverse 
reactions. They were also more common in the nintedanib arm than in the placebo arm of pivotal trial 1199.13. 
However, the level of grade ≥3 was low. The development of nausea or vomiting was temporarily associated 
within each cycle with the administration of chemotherapy. These adverse reactions were managed with 
supportive care, interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. Supportive care for nausea and 
vomiting may include medicinal products with anti-emetic properties, e.g. glucocorticoids, anti-histamines or 
5-HT3 receptor antagonists and adequate hydration. In the event of dehydration, administration of electrolytes 
and fluids is required. Plasma levels of electrolytes should be monitored, if relevant gastrointestinal adverse 
events occur. In addition, interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib may be 
required despite appropriate supportive care. The same dose reduction scheme as for diarrhoea (see above and 
section 4.2 of SmPC) is recommended in case of vomiting ≥ grade 2 and/or nausea ≥ grade 3 despite 
anti-emetic treatment. This dose adjustment scheme should also be followed in case of other 
non-haematological or haematological adverse reaction of ≥ grade 3. 
Administration of nintedanib was associated with an elevation of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALKP) or bilirubin, 
with a potentially higher risk for female patients. These increases were reversible in the majority of cases. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/726072/2014

Liver-related adverse reactions occurred in 42.8 % of nintedanib-treated patients. Approximately one third of 
these patients had liver-related adverse reactions of ≥grade 3 severity. In patients with increased liver 
parameters, the use of the established stepwise dose reduction scheme was the appropriate measure and 
discontinuation of treatment was only necessary in 2.2 % of patients.  
Transaminase, ALKP and bilirubin levels should be investigated before the initiation of the combination 
treatment with nintedanib plus docetaxel. Based on the data presented, the values should be monitored as 
clinically indicated or periodically during treatment, i.e. in the combination phase with docetaxel at the 
beginning of each treatment cycle and monthly in case nintedanib is continued as monotherapy after 
discontinuation of docetaxel (see SmPC section 4.4). Treatment interruptions followed by dose adjustment 
serve as the initial measure for the management of liver enzyme elevations. Alternative causes of the liver 
enzyme elevations should be investigated and respective action should be taken as necessary. The SmPC 
(Section 4.2) includes a specific dose reduction scheme to minimise the potential consequences of liver enzyme 
elevations while maintaining the efficacy of nintedanib treatment. If elevation of AST and/or ALT values to >5 x 
the upper limit of normal (ULN) or elevation of AST and/or ALT values to >2.5 x ULN in conjunction with total 
bilirubin elevation to ≥1.5 x ULN occur, treatment with nintedanib should be temporarily interrupted until the 
specific adverse reaction has resolved to levels that allow continuation of therapy (i.e. recovery of 
transaminase-values to ≤2.5 x ULN in conjunction with bilirubin to normal). The nintedanib dose should then be 
reduced from 200 mg twice daily to 150 mg twice daily or from 150 mg twice daily to 100 mg twice daily if a 2nd 
dose adjustement is considered necessary. In case of specific elevations of liver values (elevation of AST and/or 
ALT values to >3 x ULN in conjunction with total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN and ALKP <2 x ULN) treatment with 
nintedanib should be interrupted. Unless there is an alternative cause established, nintedanib should be 
permanently discontinued.  
There were slightly higher frequency of AEs identified by the sensitive SMQ hepatic failure in the nintedanib arm 
than in the placebo arm. It appeared that the incidence of AEs associated with hepatic failure may, to some 
degree, be dose dependent (SAF-2). Patients receiving ≤200 mg nintedanib b.i.d. had lower risk of this AE. A 
thorough case-by-case assessment of the brief case narratives for patients with hepatic failure did not reveal 
any potential safety signal with regard to hepatic failure. While there is no doubt that nintedanib can cause 
increase in liver enzymes, there seems to be no solid evidence for DILI. Section 4.4 of the SmPC adequately 
emphasizes the importance of supervision of liver enzymes. Hepatic failure has also been included in the RMP as 
an important potential risk. 
There was also a slightly higher frequency of AEs identified by a sensitive search for non-GI perforations in the 
nintedanib arm than in the placebo arm. However, a case-by-case review did not reveal an increased risk of 
non-gastrointestinal perforations. Overall, the frequency of gastrointestinal perforation was low and comparable 
between the treatment arms in the study 1199.13. However, based on the mechanism of action patients treated 
with nintedanib may have an increased risk of gastrointestinal perforations. Particular caution should be 
exercised when treating patients with previous abdominal surgery or a recent history of a hollow organ 
perforation. Nintedanib should therefore only be initiated at least 4 weeks after major surgery. Therapy with 
nintedanib should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation (see SmPC 
section 4.4).

With regard to AESI for docetaxel, there was no indication that nintedanib leads to an increase in neutropenia 
(AE) although a higher frequency of neutropenia of CTCAE grade ≥3 was observed in patients treated with 
nintedanib in combination with docetaxel as compared to treatment with docetaxel alone. Sepsis and febrile 
neutropenia were reported as subsequent complications of neutropenia. The rates of sepsis (1.3 %) and febrile 
neutropenia (7.5 %) were increased under treatment with nintedanib as compared to the placebo arm. 
Therefore, it is important that the patient’s blood counts are monitored during therapy, in particular during the 
combination treatment with docetaxel. Frequent monitoring of complete blood counts should be performed at 
the beginning of each treatment cycle and around the nadir for patients receiving treatment with nintedanib in 
combination with docetaxel, and as clinically indicated after the administration of the last combination cycle (see 
SmPC section 4.4). 
Peripheral neuropathy is also known to occur with docetaxel treatment. Peripheral neuropathy was reported in 
16.5 % of patients in the placebo arm and in 19.1 % of patients in the nintedanib arm. 
VEGFR inhibition might be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In the study 1199.13 (all patients) 
bleeding was more common in the nintedanib arm (14.1%, grade ≥3: 2.3%) than in the placebo arm (11.6%, 
grade ≥3: 1.8%) which is in contrast to the patients with adenocarcinoma where frequencies were comparable 
(10.9% vs. 11.1%). The difference in frequency was driven by a higher incidence of bleeding in the patients with 
squamous cell carcinoma (17.1% vs. 10.8%). Moreover, bleeding has also been observed in other nintedanib 
trials indicating that nintedanib may increase the frequency of bleeding events also in other tumour histologies 
than squamous cell carcinoma. 
Patients with recent pulmonary bleeding (> 2.5 ml of red blood) as well as patients with centrally located 
tumours with radiographic evidence of local invasion of major blood vessels or radiographic evidence of cavitary 
or necrotic tumours have been excluded from clinical trials. Therefore it is not recommended to treat these 
patients with nintedanib. There are no data available for patients with inherited predisposition to bleeding or for 
patients receiving a full dose of anticoagulative treatment prior to start of treatment with nintedanib. In patients 
on chronic low dose therapy with low molecular weight heparins or acetylsalicylic acid, no increased frequency 
of bleeding was observed. Patients who developed thromboembolic events during treatment and who required 
anticoagulant treatment were allowed to continue nintedanib and did not show an increased frequency of 
bleeding events. Patients taking concomitant anticoagulation, such as warfarin or phenprocoumon should be 
monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (INR), or clinical bleeding 
episodes (see SmPC section 4.4). 
No increased frequency of cerebral bleeding in patients with adequately pre-treated brain metastases which 
were stable for ≥ 4 weeks before start of treatment with nintedanib was observed. However, such patients 
should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of cerebral bleeding.  Patients with active brain metastasis 
were excluded from clinical trials and are not recommended for treatment with nintedanib (see SmPC section 
4.4). 
Patients treated with Vargatef have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism including deep vein 
thrombosis. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for thromboembolic events. Nintedanib should be 
discontinued in patients with life-threatening venous thromboembolic reactions (see SmPC section 4.4). 
CHMP assessment report

The frequency of arterial thromboembolic events was comparable between the two treatment arms in the phase 
3 study 1199.13. Patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded from this study. 
However, an increased frequency of arterial thromboembolic events was observed in patients with idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) treated with nintedanib monotherapy (data not shown). Therefore, caution should be 
used when treating patients with a higher cardiovascular risk including known coronary artery disease. 
Treatment interruption should be considered in patients who develop signs or symptoms of acute myocardial 
ischaemia (see SmPC section 4.4).  
Based on the mechanism of action nintedanib may impair wound healing. No increased frequency of impaired 
wound healing was observed in trial 1199.13. No dedicated studies investigating the effect of nintedanib on 
wound healing were performed. Treatment with nintedanib should therefore only be initiated or - in case of 
perioperative interruption - resumed based on clinical judgement of adequate wound healing (see SmPC section 
4.4). 
The Applicant has not conducted a thorough QTc study of nintedanib in combination with docetaxel, but an 
analysis across all studies did not reveal any arrhythmogenic potential of nintedanib which is reassuring. 
However, since QT-prolongation is a recognised class effect of previous TKIs (Shah et al, 2013), caution should 
be exercised when administering nintedanib in patients who may develop QTc prolongation (see SmPC section 
4.4). Cardiac failure and QT prolongation have also been included in the RMP as important potential risks based 
on findings with some approved TKIs. 
Hypertension is considered an important potential class effect of VEGFR inhibitors and can lead to 
discontinuation of treatment, hospitalisation, and can be fatal or life-threatening. However, the overall 
frequency of patients with AEs within the SMQ ‘hypertension’ was low and lower than expected from other 
VEGFR inhibitors. The AEs were mostly of mild to moderate severity and there were neither life-threatening nor 
hypertension AEs with a fatal outcome. In line with the above, the frequency of patients who started new 
antihypertensive treatment during the on-treatment period was low (2.1% of the patients in the nintedanib arm 
vs 0.6% of the patients in the placebo arm in all treated patients. In line with other VEGFR inhibitors 
hypertension was included in the RMP as important potential identified risk. 
In the two reported cases of overdose, AE occurred consistent with the known safety profile of nintedanib. There 
is no specific antidote or treatment for nintedanib overdose. In case of overdose, treatment should be 
interrupted and general supportive measures initiated as appropriate. 
Dietary soya-products are known to cause allergic reactions including severe anaphylaxis in person with soya 
allergy. Patients with known allergy to peanut protein carry an enhanced risk for severe reactions to soya 
preparations. Therefore, and due to the composition of Vargatef (see quality section), Vargatef is 
contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to nintedanib, peanut or soya, or to any of the excipients (see 
SmPC section 4.3). 
Vargatef has also minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to be 
cautious when driving or using machines during treatment with Vargatef (see SmPC section 4.7)

With regards to serious adverse events, SAEs were slightly more common in the nintedanib arm (34.4%) than 
in the placebo arm (31.5%) in trial 1199.13 (all patients). The majority of SAEs in both treatment arms 
appeared to be related to myelosuppression (i.e. febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, pyrexia and sepsis) and 
disease related symptoms (e.g. malignant neoplasm progression, dyspnoea, pneumonia, general physical 
health deterioration). The signs of myelosuppression may be seen in relation with the high level of grade ≥3 
TEAEs pertaining to myelosuppression. More SAEs were also reported in the nintedanib arm (any grade; 34.7, 
grade ≥3; 31.3%) than in the placebo arm (any grade; 32.1, grade ≥3; 27.6%) in patients with 
adenocarcinoma. The frequencies of different SAEs were comparable to the frequencies of SAEs observed in all 
patients. 
There was a higher incidence of AEs leading to death in the nintedanib arm. Time-to-death was similar for these 
patients when comparing the two treatment arms. Thus, it was that the add-on of nintedanib did not lead to 
earlier AEs leading to deaths. In the overall population in study 1199.13 the majority of AEs leading to death 
were due PD. In the placebo arm 25 AEs leading to death were not attributed to PD compared to 35 in the 
nintedanib arm. The higher exposure to study treatment and the longer time since first histological/cytological 
classification diagnosis in the nintedanib arm may be the only reasonable explanations for the difference in fatal 
AEs. The adjusted incidence rate ratio of nintedanib versus placebo for fatal AEs was 1.18 (95%CI 0.86, 1.62) 
in the adenocarcinoma population. However the analysis of fatal AEs was based on patients who died on 
treatment during administration of study drug + 28 days. The Applicant argued that such an analysis may be 
more specific to detect study treatment related differences between the two arms. This may be correct for some 
fatal AEs, but not necessarily for all fatal AEs since some will develop over a longer period of time. Consequently, 
the Applicant provided data that summarise non-PD deaths during treatment or ≤ 90 days post-treatment and 
>90 days post-treatment for all patients and adenocarcinoma patients in study 1199.13. The difference in 
non-PD deaths in the adenocarcinoma population was still present at +90 days. However, the time at risk 
adjusted analysis showed that the incidence rate ratio was comparable for all non-PD related deaths in the 
adenocarcinoma patient population (0.93 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.37)) which is reassuring. 
With regard to deaths due to non-PD related AEs, there were slightly more cases of sepsis and respiratory failure 
in the nintedanib arm. Based on a review of the case reports, there did not appear to be an association between 
nintedanib treatment and respiratory failure. With regard to sepsis, a considerable number of patients had 
concomitant neutropenia. Myelotoxicity is a known AE of treatment with docetaxel. Thus, patients being treated 
with nintedanib and docetaxel have a higher risk of sepsis. This has been adequately addressed in the SmPC and 
RMP. 
With regard to Asian patients, the number of patients with fatal non-PD deaths was comparable between the 
placebo and nintedanib group, but more than half of fatal respiratory and sepsis related non-PD deaths occurred 
in Asian patients. However, a review of the individual cases revealed no discernible clinical pattern. It is 
recognised that the numbers were very low, and that any interpretation of data should be made with caution. 
The fatal respiratory events had different underlying etiologies. Overall, there is no indication of any 
geographical pattern and the SAEs seem to be scattered all over Asia.

Since nintedanib is an add-on to docetaxel, it leads to more AEs and thereby potentially to more permanent 
discontinuations. In the adenocarcinoma population in study 1199.13 there were slightly more AEs leading to 
permanent discontinuation in the nintedanib arm in the adenocarcinoma population. These were mainly caused 
by liver enzyme increase. However, the differences were not considered to be substantial and did not lead to any 
major concerns. In the overall population in study 1199.13, the overall incidence of AEs leading to permanent 
discontinuations was considered similar. Some differences were observed, e.g. there were more cases of 
diarrhoea and malignant neoplasm progression. These events are adequately addressed in the SmPC and RMP.  
There were a higher number of patients being treated with nintedanib subject to AEs leading to dose reductions. 
The main AEs were liver enzyme increase, vomiting, diarrhoea and nausea, which are adequately addressed in 
the relevant sections of the SmPC. 
Special population 
The safety of nintedanib in children aged 0-18 years has not been established and no data are available. In 
elderly patients (≥ 65 years), no overall differences in safety were observed.  
No safety data are available in subpopulations with co-morbid CNS conditions such as dementia, depression, 
brain metastasis, or with co-morbid conditions such as arthritis and osteoporosis. Since these are common 
comorbidities in elderly cancer patients which may impact survival, treatment with Vargatef in these 
subpopulations has been included in the RMP under missing information. 
Safety data for Black and African American patients are also limited.  
The safety of nintedanib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (<30 ml/min creatinine 
clearance) nor in patients with hepatic impairment classified as Child Pugh B and C. Therefore, treatment of 
patients with hepatic impairment and treatment of patients with renal impairment have been included as 
missing information in the RMP. In addition, treatment of patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) and severe 
(Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment with Vargatef is not recommended.  
Although the number of patients weighing <50 kg was rather small and safety data should be interpreted with 
caution, SAEs appeared to be more common in these patients compared to patients with a weight ≥ 50 kg. The 
higher frequency of SAEs observed in patients <50 kg is covered in the RMP. Close monitoring is recommended 
in patients weighing < 50 kg. 
No safety data were provided on the use of Vargatef in pregnant women but pre-clinical studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity of this active substance (see section on non-clinical aspects). Therefore, pregnancy 
testing should be conducted at least prior to treatment with Vargatef. Female patients should be advised to 
notify their doctor or pharmacist if they become pregnant during therapy with Vargatef.  
Nintedanib exposure increased linearly with patient age, was inversely correlated to weight, and was generally 
higher in patients of Asian race (see clinical aspects, pharmacokinetics). This may result in a higher risk of 
developing liver enzyme elevations. Close monitoring is recommended in patients with several of these risk 
factors.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The addition of nintedanib to docetaxel led to more adverse events which were expected. The higher incidence 
of neutrophil count decreased and neutropenia led to slightly more infections in the nintedanib arm which was 
expected due to the myelotoxic effects of docetaxel and the longer exposure to study treatment in the 
nintedanib arm. 
Based on a thorough review of the deaths up to 90 days post-treatment and a risk adjusted analysis there is no 
indication of a relevant increase in of non-PD deaths due to nintedanib. The majority of the reported adverse 
events are considered manageable with dose reductions, supportive treatments and treatment interruptions. 
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) specific for nintedanib were diarrhoea, increased 
liver enzyme values (ALT and AST) and vomiting.  
As initial measure for the management of adverse reactions (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8) treatment 
with nintedanib should be temporarily interrupted until the specific adverse reaction has resolved to levels that 
allow continuation of therapy (to grade 1 or baseline). Nintedanib treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose. 
Dose adjustments in 100 mg steps per day (i.e. a 50 mg reduction per dosing) based on individual safety and 
tolerability are recommended. In case of further persistence of the adverse reaction(s), i.e. if a patient does not 
tolerate 100 mg twice daily, treatment with Vargatef should be permanently discontinued. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative 
requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
The PRAC considered that the risk management system version 1.3 could be acceptable with revisions as 
described in the attached PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes to the safety concerns and the pharmacovigilance plan. 
The CHMP considered that final data from the on-going trials investigating hepatic impairment (1199.37, 
1199.39 and 1199.120) will contribute in addressing the missing information on patients with moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment and addressing the possible influence of hepatic impairment on the PK of nintedanib. 
In addition, as the potential in vitro inhibitory effect of nintedanib on the kidney transporters OAT1 and OAT3 has 
not been investigated yet in accordance with the Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions, this issue is 
considered as missing information and the subject of a study in the pharmacovigilance plan.

Beneficial effects 
The benefits with the addition of nintedanib to docetaxel were: an increase in progression – free survival (PFS) 
of 1.4 months (4.2 months in the nintedanib plus docetaxel arm as compared to 2.8 months in docetaxel plus 
placebo arm), also expressed as a reduction in the risk of progression or death by 16 % (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84; 
95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.71; 1.00, p=0.0485) and an increase in Overall survival (OS) by 2.3 months 
(OS was 12.6 months in the nintedanib plus docetaxel arm as compared to 10.3 months in the docetaxel plus 
placebo arm). 
The data show a clinically relevant PFS gain by independent central review in favour of the nintedanib arm as 
demonstrated by a hazard ratio of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.75; 0.96, p=0.0070) in the overall patient population. While 
the OS in the overall population did not show a statistically significant difference, there is evidence towards an 
improvement in OS of nintedanib+docetaxel in the adenocarcinoma population with HR of 0.83 (95%CI, 0.70; 
0.99, p=0.0359) with no dentrimental effect on QoL. These results are supported by PFS by investigator 
(secondary endpoint), which also demonstrates a statistically significant HR (0.82). Statistically significant 
improvements in PFS were also seen for the strata of patients with adenocarcinoma histology; HR 0.84 (95% CI 
0.71, 1.00). There seems to be a consistent treatment effect across the majority of subgroups, both for PFS and 
OS, with regard to the adenocarcinoma population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Nintedanib is a multi-targeted therapy, and response to treatment would be expected to be linked to expression 
of  molecular  markers.  Tumour  marker  analysis  had  been  identified  as  crucial  by  the  CHMP  SAWP;  suitable 
bio-/tumour  markers  (including  VEGF)  to  allow identification  and  selection  of  a  more  targeted  population  of 
patients most likely to benefit from the treatment of nintedanib, will be investigated as part of a Biomarkers 
research programme and results will be provided as a post-authorisation condition (See Annex II,). 
The subgroup of patients with a disease stage < IIIB/IV and the subgroup with brain metastases did not seem 
to benefit from nintedanib. However, the numbers are low and the point estimate is associated with a very wide 
confidence interval, and no further data can be requested.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Patients in the nintedanib arm were more likely to experience Grade 3/4/5 adverse events than in the placebo 
arm. Of these, the most common AEs were: liver enzyme elevations, nausea, vomiting, decreased WBC and 
neutrophils, diarrhoea, and neutropenia. 
Some  adverse  events  of  specific  interest  also  occurred  more  frequently  than  others  in  the  nintedanib  arm: 
diarrhoea, nausea and liver-related adverse events. There were slightly more patients identified with the SMQ  
hepatic  failure  and  non-gastro-intestinal  perforations  in  the  nintedanib  versus  the  placebo  arm.  In  addition, 
there is some evidence that nintedanib in combination with docetaxel leads to a higher incidence of neutropenia, 
although  only  slight  differences  in  infections  and  febrile  neutropenia  were  observed.  With  regard  to  serious 
adverse  events,  there  were  some  slight  differences  in  the  incidences  of  Grade  3/4/5  SAEs  neutropenia  and 
malignant neoplasm progression.

More cases of sepsis and fatal sepsis were observed in the nintedanib arm. Sepsis and febrile neutropenia have 
been reported as subsequent complications of neutropenia. The rates of sepsis (1.3 %) and febrile neutropenia 
(7.5 %) were increased under treatment with nintedanib as compared to the placebo arm. 
Differences were observed on the safety of nintedanib in special populations (gender, never-smokers etc.). 
Females appeared to be more likely to experience adverse events belonging to the SMQ of liver related 
investigations. Also, never-smokers were more likely to experience neutropenia, adverse events under the SMQ 
liver related investigations and specific liver related investigations.  
Overall, these adverse events are adequately addressed in the SmPC and in the RMP. Overall, the majority of the 
reported adverse events are considered manageable with dose reductions, supportive treatments and treatment 
interruptions. 
There was also a higher incidence of adverse events leading to non-PD deaths in the nintedanib arm. However, 
based on a thorough review of these deaths up to 90 days post-treatment and a risk adjusted analysis showing 
an incidence rate ratio of 0.93 (95% CI: 0-63, 1.37) there is no indication of a relevant increase in non-PD 
deaths due to nintedanib. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety of nintedanib in special populations is not entirely clear. Further safety data will be collected 
post-marketing as reflected in the risk management plan. 
In particular, no safety data are available in the following populations: children aged 0-18 years, patients with 
co-morbid CNS conditions, patients with severe renal impairment, patients with hepatic impairment classified as 
Child Pugh B and C, patients weighing <50 kg, patients with healing wounds, as well as pregnant and 
breastfeeding women. In addition, safety data for Black and African American patients are limited. Information 
on special populations has adequately reflected in the different sections of the SmPC as a risk minimisation 
measure. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The slowing of disease progression and prolonging life is of utmost importance in a population of patients with 
NSCLC and in cancer patients in general. The risk of death due to infections and sepsis is manageable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, based on the results of the pivotal study 1199.13 and supportive study 1199.14 it can be concluded that 
the benefit-risk balance of nintedanib in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of adult patients with 
locally advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of adenocarcinoma tumour 
histology after first-line chemotherapy is positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Available data showed a clinically relevant difference in PFS.  
CHMP assessment report

Delaying progression of disease is of importance to the patients. Furthermore, a clinically relevant OS 
improvement was observed in patients with adenocarcinoma with T<9 months and the adenocarcinoma 
population in general. In the context of patients with NSCLC stage IIIB and IV disease with a median survival of 
approximately 10 months and 6 months respectively, an improvement of 2.3 months in OS in favour of 
nintedanib in the subgroup of patients with adenocarcinoma histology  is considered clinically relevant. With 
regard to patients with adenocarcinoma and T<9 months, the OS difference is even more pronounced (3 months 
in favour of nintedanib).  
The addition of nintedanib to docetaxel did not result in any unexpected safety signals and no detrimental effect 
on HRQoL could be observed, other than an increased risk of diarrhoea, which did not have any substantial effect 
on QoL. 
Both background treatments (docetaxel and pemetrexed) in studies 1199.13 and 1199.14 are well-known and 
reflect current clinical practice. Analyses of OS for the nintedanib-docetaxel combination in second-line resulted 
in comparable improvement in OS regardless of whether patients were treated with pemetrexed in first-line or 
not. No treatment interaction was found between treatment arm and first-line pemetrexed treatment when 
these groups were compared.  
Overall, the risks of nintedanib in combination with docetaxel in the treatment of adult patients with locally 
advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of adenocarcinoma tumour 
histology after first-line chemotherapy, are in general manageable by dose adjustments and out-weighted by 
the benefits consisted of clinically relevant PFS in the overall population, which is accompanied by an increase in 
OS. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Vargatef in combination with docetaxel in the treatment of of adult patients with locally 
advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of adenocarcinoma tumour 
histology after first-line chemotherapy, is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing

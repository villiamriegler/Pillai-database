Pegasys  (pegylated  interferon  alpha  2a,  PEG-IFN  α2a)  was  approved  in  2002  for  the  treatment  of 
chronic  hepatitis  B  (CHB)  and  chronic  hepatitis  C  (CHC)  in  adults  and  has  ever  since,  together  with 
peg-IFN  α2b,  replaced  the  use  of  non-pegylated  interferons  due  to  their  improved  pharmacokinetic 
properties (weekly injections) and due to their consequent better efficacy. 
In  2013  an  extension  of  indication  was  approved  for  Pegasys,  for  the  treatment  of  hepatitis  C  in 
children aged 5 years and above. That indication was approved for the other approved pegylated IFN 
(PEG-IFN  α2b)  already  in  2008.  Prior  studies  conducted  with  interferons  in  children  serve  as  an 
important source of safety information, including long term safety data on a fairly sufficient number of 
children treated with PEG-IFN α2b, where 40/48 patients who had received 48 weeks of PEG-IFN α2b 
treatment were followed for 5 years. These data were previously assessed by the CHMP and are now

also  published  (Haber  et  al,  Jan  2017).  In  general  the  safety  profile,  known  to  be  somewhat 
problematic, is considered to be similar for the different interferons. This includes a substantial risk to 
reduced final height of the individual, in particular if treatment is given during periods of growth spurts 
(puberty), which is a major safety issue in children and adolescents.  
This application concerns an extension of indication for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in children 
aged  3  years  and  above  (including  adolescents);  specifically  Hepatitis  B  eantigen  (HBeAg)  positive 
children with increased transaminases as a marker for entering/being in the immune active stage.  
Children  with  CHB  were  either  vertically infected  at the  time of  birth,  or  horizontally infected  in  early 
childhood. In the high epidemic area of South East Asia, vertical transmissions stand for the majority 
of cases. In contrast, at least historically, horizontal transmission has been the dominant type in e.g. 
southern Europe and African countries.  
Apart  from  PEG-IFNs,  a  number  of  nucleo(t)side  analogues  are  also  approved  in  the  EU  for  the 
treatment of CHB. As opposed to PEG-IFNs (an immune therapy), it is currently not clear for how long 
treatment  with  nucleos(t)ide  analogues  should  be  continued.  For  adult  HBeAg  positive  patients, 
therapy may be stopped after 1 year of viral suppression following HBe-seroconversion. However, the 
risk for virological relapse (e.g. from undetectable DNA levels to levels >10.000 IU/ml) is in the order 
of  50%  or  higher  (e.g.  Qiu  et  al  2016,  Chen  et  al  2015).  Similar  data  for  paediatric  patients  are  not 
available.  In  summary,  in  practice,  therapy  with  direct  acting  antivirals  does  not  have  a  specified 
duration and is in most cases used indefinitely to suppress viral replication. 
The natural course of HBV disease, studied in a number of cohorts, was presented at the time of the 
initial  marketing  authorisation  and  is  discussed  in  the  Pegasys  EPAR.  In  summary,  patients  vertically 
infected  would  be  in  the  majority  of  cases  in  the  immune  tolerant  phase  throughout  childhood  and 
adolescence  (HBeAgen  positive,  but  with  normal  ALTs).  During  this  stage  there  is  no  indication  for 
treatment  with  the  presently  available  therapies.  For  those  infected  in  early  childhood,  the  immune 
tolerant phase is shorter, and this stage is more or less lacking in those infected in adult life.  
The  proportion  of  children  with  an  indication  for  treatment  within  childhood  or  adolescence  would 
therefore likely be higher for children infected post-partum. More exact figures for typical time points 
for these stages by route of transmission are hard to find in the published literature, since the studies 
of main interest around the natural course of the infection (population based surveys, for example by 
McMahon 2001) are scarce and lack details, while clinically based surveys may be based on cohorts of 
children  not  necessarily  representative  for  the  whole  group  (rather  selected  for  reasons  of  elevated 
transaminases).  The  immune  active  stage  (entrance  marked  by  increasing  alanine  aminotransferase 
(ALT)  levels)  is  associated  with  a  risk  for  liver  injury,  and  therapy  with  IFN  may  shorten  that  stage, 
lowering  the  risk  of  inflammation  and  consequently  lowering  risk  of  fibrosis  development.  The  main 
objective  with  PEG-IFN  therapy  is  to  accelerate  that  process;  very  few  patients,  however,  achieve 
Hepatitis B s antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion (around 3% in adult studies), which is the ultimate goal 
of therapy for chronic hepatitis B.  
When  looking  at  long  term  outcomes  in  children  not  given  therapy,  but  followed  up  at  clinics,  two 
publications with a very long term follow-up were found in the literature.   
•  Wu  et  al  (JPGN  Volume  54,  Number  1,  January  2012,  Taiwan  single  centre)  reported  on  104 
HBeAg  positive  children,  with  a  mean  initial  age  of  7  and  a  mean  follow-up  of  24  years,  with 
assessments  of  serology  etc.  every  6-12  months.  The  vast  majority  had  HBV  subtype  B 
(n=96),  75%  were  suspected  to  have  been  infected  vertically.  None  of  the  subjects  received 
antiviral  agents  or  immune  therapy  prior  to  HBeAg  seroconversion.  During  follow-up 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 6/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
spontaneous  HBe  seroconversion  (loss  of  HBeAg  and  developing  of  the  corresponding 
antibody) occurred in 80% (n=83) of the subjects, at a median age of 15 (range 1 to 33). Of 
note,  this  group  was  selected  (having  at  least  some  ALT  elevation  when  referred  to  the 
center). 
•  Bortolotti  reported  similar  data  from  a  29-year  longitudinal  study  (Italian  single  centre), 
concerning 91 HBeAg positive children, also with a mean age of 7 years at study entry. These 
children were (likely) predominantly horizontally infected, and in practice all were infected with 
HBV  genotype  D  (typical  for  this  region).  During  follow-up  HBe  seroconversion  was 
documented  for  all  89  with  >  1  year  of  follow-up.  Seven  children  were  treated  with  standard 
IFN  (24  weeks)  due  to  sustained  HBeAg  positivity,  none  of  them  responded,  but  had  a 
spontaneous  clearance  later;  another  14  received  other  treatments  (however  none  received 
direct  acting  antivirals).  Of  64  untreated  children  without  baseline  cirrhosis,  59  remained  as 
stable  inactive  carriers  following  HBe  seroconversion  and  without  evidence  of  marked  liver 
injury, the others had further reactivations. Four children (age 4.5 ± 4.2 years) had cirrhosis 
at  baseline,  of  whom  2  developed  hepatocellular  cancer,  9  and  16  years  after  HBe 
seroconversion. The mean age for HBe seroconversion was 11 years for those who converted 
in that system but remained active carriers.  
In adults, response to PEG-IFN therapy differs by HBV genotype. This is discussed in some detail in the 
efficacy section of this assessment report, but overall the highest HBe seroconversion rates have been 
seen in patients with genotypes A and B, followed by genotype C and with the lowest rates in genotype 
D-infected patients. To what extent this is an effect by HBV genotype per se, or rather/also an effect 
by other baseline demographics that happen to be associated to HBV genotype is not fully elucidated, 
as the mechanistic basis for these circumstances is not known. 
New  HBV  genotypes  were  discovered  in  more  recent  years;  to  date  9  genotypes  have  been  defined 
(McMahon, 2015). Of note, data on outcomes with PEG-IFN has basically been presented for genotypes 
A-D, very scarcely for the others.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No  new  non-clinical  data  have  been  submitted  for  the  new  paediatric  indication.  The  MAH  has 
submitted a justification for not providing a full environmental risk assessment (ERA). This justification 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP.   
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  EMA  2006  guideline  on  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  for  non-GMO  human  medicinal 
products  [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr.  2;  ref.  1]  requires  an  ERA  for  the  marketing  authorisation 
application  (MAA)  of  all  new  medicinal  products  in  the  European  Union.  For  proteins  and  peptides, 
however,  the  “ERA  may  consist  of  a  justification  for  not  submitting  ERA  studies,  e.g.  due  to  their 
nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment”.  
Interferon  alfa-2a  (CAS  no.  76543–88–9,  molecular  mass  ~19  kDa),  the  pharmaceutical  active 
ingredient  in  Pegasys,  is  a  recombinant  human  cytokine  signalling  protein  with  antiviral  and 
immunomodulating properties. Pegasys (polyethylen glycol–IFN α2a or PEG-IFN α2a) is a molecule of 
interferon  alfa-2a  conjugated  with  a  branched  polyethylene  glycol  chain  of  approximately  40  kDal. 
Pegylation  of  proteins  has  been  specifically  developed  for  medical  applications  as  it  strongly  extends 
the human half-life of elimination, delaying both enzymatic metabolism and urinary excretion. Hence, 
pegylation  increases  the  therapeutic  efficacy  through  prolonging  the  period  between  administrations, 
meaning  that  the  active  substance  needs  to  be  administered  less  often  while  active  therapeutic 
concentrations are maintained throughout.  
Environmentally Relevant Properties of Interferon alfa-2a and Peginterferon alfa-2a 
IFN α2a is not mutagenic, not teratogenic and not known to be reprotoxic or carcinogenic or to have 
endocrine  activity.  Being  a  protein,  it  is  not  bioavailable  by  oral  administration  (as  it  would  be 
digested) but must be given by injection. It is rapidly metabolised in the human body and therefore it 
will  not  bioaccumulate,  but  it  will  be  excreted  in  the  form  of  non-recognisable  and  non-functional 
fragments. 
IFN  α2a  was  tested  as  the  formulated  solution  for  ready  biodegradability  (OECD  test  guideline  301F) 
and for acute ecotoxicity towards algae (Scenedesmus (= Desmodesmus) subspicatus, OECD 201) and 
waterflea (Daphnia magna, OECD 202) [8], all under GLP,  for classification and labelling purposes as 
well as for an initial environmental risk estimation. 
The  formulated  solution  as  a  whole  and,  factoring  in  the  biochemical  oxygen  demand  in  the  blank 
control  as  well  as  the  theoretical  oxygen  demand  by  the  excipients,  the  active  pharmaceutical 
ingredient  IFN  α2a  itself,  proved  to  be  readily  biodegradable  according  to  the  OECD  criteria.  Hence, 
any  active  substance  that  might  theoretically  escape  human  metabolism  may  be  expected  to  be 
removed during sewage treatment. 
 IFN α2a solution was not significantly toxic to algae and daphnids, with both 50% effect values (ErC50 
respectively  EC50)  greater  than  the  only  tested  concentration  of  100  mg    IFN  α2a/l.  While  these  are 
only acute endpoints, they do support a low risk for unexpected aquatic ecotoxicity of  IFN α2a. 
These  results  align  well  with  several other protein  active  pharmaceutical  substances  that  were tested 
for  ready  biodegradability  and  acute  ecotoxicity.  All  unaltered  protein  active  substances,  without 
exception,  proved  to  be  readily  biodegradable,  resulting  in  extremely  low  predicted  environmental 
concentrations in receiving waters. Also, acute ecotoxicity was not remarkable for any of the unaltered 
protein active substances.

 PEG-IFN  α2a  is  not  mutagenic  and  is  not  known  to  be  reprotoxic  or  carcinogenic,  nor  is  it  known  to 
bioaccumulate, despite the prolonged elimination half-life due to the pegylation. Like  IFN α2a, it is not 
suspected of endocrine activity. 
 PEG-IFN α2a  was tested in a ready biodegradability Closed Bottle test (OECD 301D) with a very low 
concentration  of  activated  sludge  bacteria  (0.1  ml  of  coarsely  filtered  secondary  effluent  from  a 
municipal sewage works in the Netherlands per litre) under GLP. Standard Pegasys solution was used 
and the degradation values were corrected for oxygen demand in the blank control, for the theoretical 
oxygen demand by the excipients and for nitrification (ThODNO3). The test showed 19% respectively 
22% degradation at PEG-IFN α2a initial concentrations of 8.2 mg/l respectively 3.36 mg/l in 28 days. 
At both test concentrations a plateau corresponding to approximately 20% biodegradation was already 
reached by day 7 and 14, respectively. 
Acute  ecotoxicity  tests  with  daphnids  (Daphnia  magna,  OECD  202)  and  fish  (Cyprinus  carpio,  OECD 
203)  were  performed  under  GLP  for  Classification  and  Labelling  purposes  as  well  as  for  an  initial 
environmental  risk  estimation.  Both  tests  showed  no  adverse  effects  at  the  tested  nominal 
concentration  of  300  mg  PEG-IFN  α2a/l,  corresponding  to  100  mg  IFN  α2a  moiety/  l.  While  these 
endpoints are only acute, they do support a low risk for unexpected aquatic ecotoxicity of Pegasys. 
Conclusion on Environmentally Relevant Properties 
Taken  together,  the  two  ready  biodegradability  tests  make  it  likely  that  the  partial  degradation 
observed  in  the  Closed  Bottle  test  with  PEG-IFN  α2a  corresponds  to  biodegradation  of  the  IFN  α2a 
moiety. This conclusion is supported by the three facts, (1) that this partial degradation was reached 
quite rapidly, within 7–14 days into the test, (2) that IFN α2a itself is readily biodegradable [6] and (3) 
that while long-chained polyethylen glycols basically are biodegradable, their degradation proceeds the 
slower the longer the polyethylen glycol chain length is.  However,  no substance-specific analysis was 
performed in the Closed Bottle test with PEG-IFN α2a to corroborate this hypothesis. 
Moreover,  both  PEG-IFN  α2a  and  IFN  α2a  are  not  mutagenic  and  are  not  known  to  be  reprotoxic  or 
carcinogenic,  moreover,  they  are  not  suspected  of  having  bioaccumulative  properties,  nor  endocrine 
activity.  Last,  based  on  a  limited  set  of  acute  test  data,  there  is  no  indication  of  any  high  or  specific 
ecotoxicity for both compounds. 
In addition to the considerations regarding the environmental properties of PEG-IFN α2a, Pegasys has 
been on the market in Europe for about 15 years. Therefore, available sales data in European countries 
for the years 2005–2015 were obtained from IMS Health, Inc., with the data covering the following 24 
countries:  Austria,  Belgium,  Bulgaria,  Croatia,  Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  Finland,  France,  Germany, 
Greece,  Hungary,  Ireland,  Italy,  Luxembourg,  the  Netherlands,  Poland,  Portugal,  Romania,  Slovakia, 
Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
In  January  2015,  these  countries  were  estimated  by  Eurostat,  the  EU  Statistics  Office,  to  have  a 
combined  population  of  508'930'708  inhabitants.  Excluding  some  non-EU  ex-Yugoslavian  states,  this 
figure  corresponds  to  97.4%  of  the  combined  EU–28  plus  EFTA  (IS+LI+NO+CH)  population  of 
527'381'309 inhabitants. Therefore, the data are regarded as representative for Europe as a whole. 
Total Pegasys sales amounts in kg relating to the interferon alfa-2a moiety per annum and country for 
the above representative European countries range from 0.116 kg to 0.331 kg within the period 2005 
to  2015.  As  these  figures  only  capture  the  IFN  α2a  moiety,  a  multiplication  by  a  factor  of  3  will  give 
the total amounts for PEG-IFN α2a. This conversion is included in the derivation of the realistic worst-
case predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for surface water below. 
European surface water PECs were derived based on the converted sales data per annum and country, 
which  were  transformed  from  kg  to  ng,  divided  by  the  population  of  the  respective  country  for  that 
Assessment report

year, by 365 days per annum, by a default EU wastewater volume of 200 l per inhabitant and day, and 
by  a  default  EU  surface  water  dilution  factor  of  10.  As  usual  for  an  initial  worst-case  PEC  derivation 
neither removal in patient metabolism nor during sewage treatment was included. 
The spreadsheet calculates surface water PEC values for total PEG-IFN α2a ranging from a minimum of 
0.000101 ng/l (nanograms per litre) to a maximum of 0.010058 ng/l for single countries in the period 
of  2005  to  2015.  Hence,  the  actual-use-based  surface  water  PECs  were  a  factor  of  1000  to  100'000 
below the 2006 EMA ERA Guideline 'action limit' of 10 ng/l.  
Conclusion 
With  the  documented-use-based  surface  water  PECs  for  PEG-IFN  α2a  being  at  least  a  factor  of  1000 
below the EMA 'action limit', even an additional paediatric patient population with chronic hepatitis B in 
the immune-active phase will not significantly increase those PECs. Therefore, the EMA ERA Guideline 
Phase 1 'action limit' for the PEG-IFN α2a PEC will not be reached by far. 
In  addition,  PEG-IFN  α2a  (and  IFN  α2a)  is  not  mutagenic  and  not  known  to  be  reprotoxic  or 
carcinogenic,  also,  it  is  not  suspected  to  have  bioaccumulative  properties  nor  endocrine  activity.  On 
the  other  hand,  there  are  experimental  data  suggesting  that  the  pharmacologically  active  moiety  of 
Pegasys,  IFN  α2a,  will  be rapidly biodegraded.  Moreover,  based  on  acute  tests,  there is  no indication 
for high unexpected ecotoxicity. Therefore, due to its nature, PEG-IFN α2a (and IFN α2a) is unlikely to 
result  in  a  significant  risk  to  the  environment.  This  conclusion  confirms  the  general  finding  that 
monoclonal antibodies and other biologics (protein or peptide) active pharmaceutical substances do not 
pose a risk to the environment. 
Based on the data presented above, the CHMP agreed that no full ERA according to the 2006 EMA ERA 
Guideline  (corr.  2)  is  required  for  the  additional  indication  for  Pegasys  in  paediatric  patients  from  3 
years of age and older with chronic hepatitis B in the immune-active phase.  
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted for the new paediatric indication and CHMP agreed that 
none were required. The MAH has submitted a justification for not providing a full environmental risk 
assessment. This justification was considered acceptable by the CHMP.   
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based  on  the  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application,  CHMP  considered  that  the  extension  of  the 
currently approved indication for Pegasys is not likely to lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of Peginterferon alfa-2a.  
CHMP agreed that Peginterferon alfa-2a is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  pegylated  interferon  alfa-2a  PEG-IFN  α2a  (PEG-IFN  in  tables  and  text 
below) in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was evaluated as part of study YV25718.  
Data 
Study YV25718 was a randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open label, multicentre study of PEG-IFN 
α2a treatment compared to an untreated control. A more detailed description of the study is provided 
in  section  “Clinical  Efficacy”  of  this  assessment  report.  Patients  without  advanced  fibrosis  were 
randomized  2:1  to  either  active  treatment  (Group  A)  or  to  an  untreated  control  arm  (Group  B). 
Patients with advanced fibrosis were assigned to a third treatment arm (Group C). Treatment lasted for 
48 weeks with a follow up period of 24 weeks (data available) and subsequently an extended planned 
follow  up  period  of  4.5  years  (data  not  available).  Patients  in  the  untreated  control  group  (Group  B) 
who  had  not  experienced  HBeAg  seroconversion  were  offered  active  treatment  with  PEG-IFN  after 
completing the principal observation period (48 weeks after randomization). 
The PK sub-study aimed to confirm adequate PEG-IFN exposure following administration of a new BSA-
category dosing regimen in paediatric patients with CHB.  
The dosing regimens based on the BSA categories are summarized in the following table: 
Table 2 Paediatric Dosing Regimen Based on BSA categories 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 11/64 
 
 
For participating patients, PK samples were collected at week 1 and week 24 pre-dose (0), and 24-48, 
72-96, and 168 hours after administration of PEG-IFN. Pre-dose samples were also collected at weeks 
4, 8, and 12 within 6 hours prior to PEG-IFN administration. Subjects were to take all doses of PEG-IFN 
associated with both pre- and post-dose PK sampling at the clinic. 
Methods 
Bioanalysis 
The serum concentrations of PEG-IFN were assessed by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). The assay was conducted using 100 µL of 5-fold diluted human serum. The lower limit 
of  quantification  in  undiluted  serum  was  250pg/mL.  The  calibration  range  was  250  pg/mL  to  5000 
pg/mL.  The  precision  and  accuracy  of  the  assay,  as  determined  from  the  analysis  of  quality  control 
samples were satisfactory throughout the study and ranged from 5.4% to 9.9% (precision) and from -
4.9% to -1.5% (accuracy, RE). 
Population PK modelling 
-  Data and exclusions 
A  population  PK  model  of  PEG-IFN  in  paediatric  patients  was  developed  based  on  data  from  study 
YV25718 and data in adults originating from four clinical studies. The data in adults were initially used 
to develop the structural population PK model of PEG-IFN including covariates, and the data from study 
YV25718  were  then  added  to  develop  a  population  PK  model  of  PEG-IFN  in  paediatric  patients  and 
adults. 
The  table  below  summarizes  the  adult  studies  included  in  the  PopPK  analysis  together  with  the 
paediatric study YV25718.

Table 3 Summary of study designs of clinical studies [included in the PopPK 
analysis] 
Nonlinear  mixed  effects  modelling  (with  software  NONMEM)  was  used  to  analyse  the  sparse  dose-
concentration-time  data  and  derive  PK  parameters  (e.g.,  clearance  [CL/F],  volume  of  distribution 
[V/F], AUC, etc.) using a population PK modelling approach. 
Based on the exploratory graphical analysis, five outlying data points and all quantifiable pre-first dose 
concentrations  were  deleted  from  the  dataset.  In  addition,  two  data  points  were  removed  as  the 
Conditional Weighted Residual (CWRES) was > 4 and eight data points were removed as CWRES was 
<  -4.  In  the  NONMEM  runs,  all  plasma  concentrations  below  the  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ) 
were excluded. Data from subject ID 127 were excluded in the NONMEM runs as only one data point 
was available. Finally, all data from subject ID 7320 of study YV25718 were excluded in the NONMEM 
runs as this subject was defined by the bioanalytical lab to be non-evaluable due to high interference 
peak  at  baseline.  As  a  summary,  from  160  subjects  with  at  least  one  quantified  concentration  and 
3131  data  points,  172  previously  excluded  data  points  in  the  original  file,  15  detected  outliers,  371 
BLQ data points and two subjects with 10 data points were excluded. 
-  Modelling procedure 
Data from the clinical studies NP17354, NP17355, PP22512 and PP22612 were used first to develop a 
structural population PK model of PEG-IFN in adults. A covariate analysis was then performed and 
subsequently the data of paediatric study YV25718 were added with the aim of developing a 
population PK model for PEG-IFN in children including selected covariates. Finally, model evaluation 
was carried out using visual predictive check (VPC) to assess the model’s ability to simulate the same 
data that have been used for the model development. The heterogeneous designs between the studies 
were taken into account.  
The influence of continuous and categorical covariates was tested for their significance and clinical 
relevance on parameter with random effects: clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V). The 
covariates that were tested in the model were sex, age, race, body mass index (BMI), body surface 
area (BSA), body weight (WT), lean body weight (LBW), creatinine clearance (CLCR), and infection 
with HCV versus HBV. Forward addition and backward deletion of covariates was performed by using 
stepwise covariate model building (SCM). Forward covariate selection was performed using a p-value 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 13/64 
 
 
 
of p< 0.05 as the selection criterion. Subsequently, backwards deletion was per formed using a p-
value of p< 0.01 as the selection criterion. 
Standard methods were used to evaluate models including residual error diagnostic plots, difference 
objective function value between competing models, standard error of estimates and model 
convergence. To evaluate the predictive performance of the model, a visual predictive check (VPC was 
performed on the final model parameter estimates. 
-  Modelling results 
The structural population PK (popPK) model of PEG- IFN in adults consisted of a one compartment 
disposition model with a sequential zero- first order absorption and an endogenous IFN level. As PK 
data from a renal impairment study were included, the effect of creatinine clearance (CLcr) on 
clearance (CL) was incorporated into the model from the beginning of model development onwards. As 
the model in adults was planned to be used as a basis for developing a population PK model of PEG- 
IFN in children, the effects of body weight (WT) on CL and volume of distribution (V) were also 
included from the beginning of model development onwards. 
The final population PK model to describe the pharmacokinetics of PEG- IFN in adults and children was 
a one-compartment disposition model with sequential zero- first order absorption. CL was impacted by 
CLcr and WT, and V was impacted by WT. An ‘endogenous’ level of IFN was included in the model and 
was estimated to be 0.25 ng/mL. No additional covariates were identified in the covariate modelling for 
the combined adult/children model. The parameter estimates are shown in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 14/64 
 
 
Table 4 PEG-IFN parameter estimates for the final population PK model (run 140) 
in adults and children  
The population PK model estimates of typical clearance and volume of distribution were largely 
consistent with the estimates in the EPAR of 2005. Parameter precision was acceptable except for the 
effect of creatinine clearance on the clearance of PEG-IFN. In that case the relative standard error is 
100% and the confidence interval included 0 (null effect). Further, the effect of body weight on the 
volume of distribution was estimated to 1.52 which should be compared to the theoretical value of 1.0. 
This would predict lower trough values in adults compared to children which may or may not be a 
reason for the under prediction of trough concentration in adults seen in the VPCs.  
A visual predictive check for the final population PK model of PEG-IFN in adults was performed and the 
results are presented in the figure below. For purpose of comparison, the corresponding VPCs of adult

trough values are included for the final adult model (lower left) and for the combined model of adult 
and children (lower right), respectively. 
Figure 2 VPCs for the final model in adults (top row and lower left panel) along 
with VPC af trough in adults for the final adult/children model (lower right panel). 
Grey circles are observed data. Solid red lines are the median of the observed data. Dashed blue lines are 10th-90th 
percentiles of the observed data. Pink areas around the observed median and blue areas around the observed 10th- 90th 
percentiles are the respective predicted 95% confidence intervals. 
The PopPK modelling was carried out using standard methods which was considered adequate by the 
CHMP. The visual predictive check for the adult model showed a slight but consistent under prediction 
of the central tendency in plasma PEG-IFN concentration. For the combined model for adults and 
children, this trend was more evident when looking at adult trough values. Also, the plot of conditional 
residual error vs. time shows evidence of under prediction of the PEG-IFN concentration at later time 
points (not shown). 
The results of the VPCs for the final model in adults and children are presented in the following figure. 
Of note, only the VPCs for data from children are shown.

During the assessment, CHMP highlighted that the PopPK model of combined adult and children data is 
important for justifying the dosing regimen in children. It was considered important that the influence 
of body size (e.g. BSA or body weight) on PK parameters was modelled in a proper way. The MAH 
elaborated the rationale for estimating the relation for one of the exponents and not for the other, and 
the discrepancy between observed and simulated data seen for trough concentration in adult patients. 
A VPC of trough values in adults for a model where the allometric exponents were both fixed to their 
theoretical values (0.75 and 1.0, respectively) was also submitted and assessed at request of CHMP. 
Attempts were made to fix the allometric exponents for their theoretical values (i.e.: 0.75 for CL and 1 
for V) during the PopPK model development. An allometric exponent higher than the theoretical value 
seemed required to describe the influence of covariates on the PK properties of PEG-IFN. Although, the 
physiological reasons for this finding were not fully elucidated, fixing the exponent for volume to the 
theoretical value of 1 had no impact on the main results of the PopPK analysis which is that the applied 
BSA category-based dosing of PEG-IFN in children results in similar PK exposures between paediatric 
and adult patients. 
Taken together, the data showed that the model fit was not improved using a fixed theoretical 
allometric exponent on volume of distribution. Further, it was shown that the under prediction of 
trough concentration was not related to the allometric exponent being fixed or not. This was 
considered adequate by the CHMP.

A total of 31 patients from 6 centres participated in the PK substudy. Seventeen, nine and five patients 
were from Group A, the Switch arm and Group C, respectively. 
The median (range) age was 7 years (3 years to 17 years). Nine patients were < 5 years of age, 11 
patients were between 5 years and 12 years of age and 11 patient < 12 years of age. Approximately 
one third of the patients were female. 
The median (range) body weight was 27 kg (15 kg to 87.5 kg). The median (range) body surface area 
(BSA) was 0.987 m2 (0.62 m2 to 2.06 m2). 
Paediatric PK parameters were estimated from sparse PK data using the population PK model. One of 
the 31 participating patients was deemed non-evaluable and excluded from PK analyses. A summary of 
estimated PEG-IFN exposures (AUC) is shown in the following table and figure.

Table 6 Summary of predicted steady-state AUC by study 
In general, a higher mean exposure was predicted for children while the maximal exposure was similar 
between adults and children. The minimum exposure in children was higher than the minimum 
exposure in adults. The variability in terms of CV% was similar. 
During the assessment, the MAH examined the goodness of fit in view of the rather limited number of 
subjects included and of the sparse PK sampling. Inspection of the separate VPCs provided by the MAH 
for children showed that the simulations were consistent with observed data. In addition, inspection of 
the individual plots of observed data at week 1 and week 24 with population and individual predictions 
for the final run showed that the final population PK model is able to adequately describe the PEG-IFN 
concentration-time data. 
The low exposures observed in some paediatric patients were not considered to be a consequence of 
dose reduction or treatment interruption but rather reflect the high between- and within-patient 
variability in PEG-IFN pharmacokinetics observed in adults. 
CHMP agreed that the assessed data showed the ability of the model to describe PK data in children.  
Comparison was made to historical data including the study in children with hepatitis C (NR16141). 
The following figure shows the exposure from both pediatric studies and from adult hepatitis C and 
hepatitis B studies. The median AUCSS in study NR16141 was 5583 h*ng/mL, while the median AUCSS 
was 3184 h*ng/mL in study YV25718.

Figure 4 PEG-IFN exposure from both pediatric studies and from adult hepatitis C 
and hepatitis B studies 
The marketing authorisation holder of Pegasys considered that the observed difference in exposure 
between studies YV25718 and NR16141 was mainly due to random variation (sample size effect). 
Nevertheless, since overexposure may be of concern, CHMP considered that the reasons for the 
observed difference had to be further explored, to allow the model predicted exposure for the younger 
children to be trusted. 
During the assessment, the MAH explained that the PK data of the paediatric CHB study YV25718 were 
pooled with multiple-dose PK data from other clinical studies that were conducted within the last 10 
years. Older clinical studies were not selected, as the collection of date and time of events informing 
the PK events, such as dosing and PK sampling, were not considered optimal. Uncertainties in PK 
sample collection times and also in compliance could significantly impact the robustness of a 
population PK model and could also artificially increase variabilities and uncertainties, especially when 
sparse PK samples are collected. The paediatric CHC study NR16141 was conducted more than 14 
years ago and the PK sample collection was relatively sparse. This study was therefore not selected to 
be included in the current population PK analysis. It was also established, based on the population PK 
analysis of this study, that the PK time course profiles could not be always properly described due to 
rather large intra-patient variability in some patients, potentially due to limited compliance to the 
weekly dosing regimen. To further illustrate why PK data collected in study NR16141 data were 
excluded from a pooled analysis, a comparison of the raw PK data between NR16141 and YV25718 
using dose-adjusted concentration plot as well as a comparison of the raw PK data of NR16141 with 
the population PK prediction of NR16141 using the population PK model build on YV25718 data were 
conducted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 20/64 
 
 
 
 
In addition it was confirmed that PK data collected in the paediatric CHC study, and in particular the 
data collected after multiple dosing, were not in accordance with the current understanding of the PK 
properties of PEG-IFN in paediatric CHB patients as well as in adult CHC and CHB patients. While the 
higher than expected accumulation in the paediatric CHC study could not be fully elucidated, the lack 
of concordance of the estimated CL in the paediatric CHC study with the allometric relationship 
(contrary to the CHB paediatric study)  as well as the lack of PK differences between adult CHC and 
CHB patients, were interpreted to increase the likelihood that this higher than expected accumulation 
could be due to limited compliance to the weekly dosing regimen in the paediatric CHC study.  
Moreover, it was noted that the PK results in CHB were consistent in paediatric and adult patients and 
that, in addition, the PK results in adults are consistent for the CHB and CHC populations. The only 
dataset that did not fit this consistent picture were the results of study NR16141. The new information 
from CHB paediatric trials was considered important and was consistent with the decision made by the 
CHMP in 2013 to select the CHC dosing in children in the Pegasys SmPC on the basis of the doses 
tested in the paediatric Phase III clinical trial (NV17424) (rather than based on the PK results from 
study NR16141). 
CHMP agreed to the MAH position that inclusion of the data from the NR16141 to the YV25718 analysis 
would have resulted in population pharmacokinetic estimates which would not have been truly 
representative of the pharmacokinetics of PEG-IFN in children and that this approach was therefore not 
warranted.  
During the assessment of the present extension of indication procedure, CHMP also requested further 
clarification on the indication proposed by the MAH for the treatment of children aged 3 years and 
above with CHB, with a posology covering a BSA from 0.54, in view of the currently approved 
indication for chronic hepatitis C, which was limited from 5 years of age and a BSA of 0.71, due to 
uncertainties about exposure in smaller children. 
The MAH explained that the proposal for the CHB indication with a lower limit of 3 years was based on 
the results of study YV25718 which enrolled patients from 3 to 17 years of age.  Patients from each 
protocol-defined BSA category were enrolled in the trial, with the exception of the BSA category 0.51-
0.53, where no patients were enrolled.  The population pharmacokinetic analysis, conducted in a 
substudy (N=31) also included all BSA categories > 0.53 m2.  Using the BSA category based dosing 
regimen resulted in similar exposure across all BSA categories studied.  In contrast, data for the 
hepatitis C paediatric indication were based on results of two studies: Study NV17424, the pivotal 
Phase 3 study - originally designed and conducted by the US National Institute of Health, with no PK 
sampling - and the pharmacokinetic study NR16141.  In study NV17424, patients were enrolled with 
ages ranging from 5 to 17 years and BSA ranging from 0.71-2.18 m2. In study NR16141 (N=14), 
patients were enrolled with ages ranging from 2 to 8 years and BSA ranging from 0.6 to 1.3 m2.  The 
lower BSA range was therefore determined by the smallest set of patients included in the trials. 
CHMP agreed to the above rationale. A further discussion on a potential harmonisation of the lower age 
limit and BSA between the two paediatric indications was not considered warranted. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of PEG-IFN in children was investigated in study YV25718 where 31 children from 3 years to17 
years of age received weekly doses of PEG-IFN by the subcutaneous route according the following BSA 
based dose categories:

BSA = body surface area (estimated using the Mosteller formula) 
Relatively sparse plasma sampling was performed in a sub-study to determine the PK of PEG-IFN in 
the children. The data was modeled together with adult data and individual steady state exposure was 
predicted using the model and individual PK observations. This was considered to be adequate 
provided that the model fits the data well.  
The population PK model based on combined adult and children data is important for justifying the 
dosing regimen in children. The exposure is intended to be similar between adults and children and the 
model is used for simulation of the exposure in the different BSA categories. It is therefore important 
that the influence of body size (e.g. BSA or body weight) on PK parameters is adequately modelled. 
The allometric exponent for the relation between body weight and clearance was fixed to 0.75 while 
the relation between volume of distribution and body weight was estimated to 1.52. The rationale for 
estimating the relation for one of the exponents and not the other was unclear to CHMP, as the volume 
of distribution influences the trough concentration and a discrepancy between observed and simulated 
data was seen for trough concentration in adult patients. Therefore, CHMP requested a VPC of trough 
values in adults for a model where the allometric exponents were fixed to their theoretical values (0.75 
and 1.0, respectively).  
During the procedure, the MAH provided additional graphics and modelling results to justify the 
rationale for estimating the relation for one of the exponents. Collectively, the data showed that the 
model fit appeared not to be improved using a fixed theoretical allometric exponent on volume of 
distribution. Further, it was shown that the under prediction of trough concentration did not seem to be 
related to this allometric exponent being fixed or not. This was considered adequate by the CHMP. 
Another issue that was discussed and clarified regarding the model fit was the number of children 
included in the population PK data set (n = 31). Since this number of subjects was rather limited and 
PK sampling was sparse, a more thorough examination of the goodness of fit was considered 
warranted by CHMP, especially since some of the individually predicted PK profiles differed from the 
population prediction.  To address this concern, the MAH provided more detailed analyses (VPCs) to 
show the ability of the model to describe PK data in children. The additional plots showed that an 
adequate fit was achieved overall. New individual goodness-of-fit plots were also provided and these 
also showed an adequate fit of the model to the data. 
In light of the limited number of children included in the population PK data, another clarification point 
raised during the assessment was the exclusion of study NR16141 (conducted in paediatric CHC 
patients) from the population PK analysis. The marketing authorisation holder was required to justify 
the rationale for exclusion of this study from the population PK model, especially since exposure in 
these children was 25% to 70% higher than that observed in adults and that over-exposure was of 
concern. 
The MAH provided the rationale as to why the data from study NR16141 was not included in the 
population PK analysis. The data from this study were modelled together with data from paediatric 
patients with CHB (study YV25718) to allow for a comparison between the population PK analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 22/64 
 
 
 
results excluding or including study NR16141. Despite differences that were observed in the modelled 
apparent clearance in study NR16141 compared to other available PK data, CHMP agreed that the MAH 
approach of excluding the data from study NR16141 from the population PK analysis was acceptable. 
CHMP also noted during the assessment the differences between the proposed indication for paediatric 
CHB compared to the existing paediatric indication for CHC (for CHB from 3 years of age, with a 
posology covering a BSA from 0.54 versus from 5 years of age and a BSA of 0.71 for CHC). The MAH 
explained that the proposal for the CHB indication with a lower limit of 3 years was based on the 
results of study YV25718 which enrolled patients from 3 to 17 years of age.  In contrast, data for the 
hepatitis C paediatric indication were based on results of two other studies: Study NV17424, the 
pivotal Phase 3 study, and the pharmacokinetic study NR16141 which employed different entry criteria 
than the paediatric CHB study YV25718.  Consequently, the BSA and age limit for treatment were 
based on the inclusion criteria of the study as well as the observed range of BSA and age. The 
population model, which fits the data, does suggest consistent PK in the studied range. From a PK 
point of view the proposed age and BSA limits were considered acceptable by CHMP.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
CHMP agreed that the PK of PEG-IFN α2a in children with chronic hepatitis B in the immune-active 
phase aged from 3 to less than 18 years has been adequately described using population PK modelling 
of combined adult and children PK data.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The data in support for this extension of indication come from a multi-centre open label study. Children 
without severe fibrosis were randomized (2:1) to Pegasys for 48 weeks or to no treatment; it was not 
considered ethical to have a placebo-controlled study for reasons easy to understand. As described 
below, those allocated to no treatment had a chance to receive therapy post week 48. Those with 
severe fibrosis (F3) received active therapy at study entry. 
2.4.1.  Main study – study YV25718 
Centres and countries: Australia (2 sites), Belgium (2), Bulgaria (2), China (10), Germany (1), Israel 
(3), Italy (1), Poland (3), Russia (4), Ukraine (2), United Kingdom (3), and the US (4) 
Period of trial: July 2012 (first patient enrolled), January 2016 (cut-off for primary analysis) 
The study concerns the outcomes with 48 weeks of peg-IFN alpha 2a therapy (Pegasys, dose by BSA 
bands), or no treatment, randomised (2:1), in children 3- <18 years of age with e-antigen positive 
CHB in the immune-active phase.   
Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria 
A patient was included if the answer to all of the following statements was “yes”: 
• 
Positive HBsAg for more than 6 months, and positive HBeAg plus HBV-DNA >2000 IU/ml at 
screening 
•  A liver biopsy performed within 2 years prior to baseline to confirm the presence of advanced 
fibrosis [allocation to placebo not ethic] or exclude cirrhosis [not to be included in this study]. 
For patients with advanced fibrosis, a liver biopsy had to have been performed within 9 months 
prior to baseline.

•  Compensated liver disease (Child-Pugh Class A) 
•  ALT > upper limit of normal (ULN) but ≤10 X ULN as determined by two abnormal values 
taken ≥14 days apart during the preceding 6 months (at least sample obtained ≤35 days prior 
to the first dose). 
Main exclusion criteria  
•  History or other evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease other 
than CHB, including the presence of antibodies to HCV or HDV. 
•  HIV co-infection.  
•  Neutrophil count < 1.5 x 109 cells/L, platelet count < 90 x 109 cells/L or hemoglobin < lower 
limit of normal (LLN).  Screening albumin < lower limit of normal or total bilirubin > ULN.  
Evidence of renal impairment 
• 
•  History of immunologically mediated disease 
•  Major depression or history of psychiatric disorder 
• 
Thyroid disease poorly controlled on prescribed medications or clinically relevant abnormal 
thyroid function tests 
• 
Poorly controlled diabetes 
Treatments 
Patients without advanced fibrosis were randomized 2:1 to PEG-IFN treatment (Group A) or untreated 
control (Group B), respectively. Untreated controls without a spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion 
during the 48 weeks of principal follow-up were offered therapy; an offer that remained for 1 year post 
primary follow-up. 
Patients with advanced fibrosis were assigned to PEG-IFN treatment (Group C), since it was considered 
un-ethical to withhold treatment for these subjects. Advanced fibrosis was defined as a liver biopsy 
with Metavir score 3 (out of 4), or Knodell fibrosis score 3, Modified Ishak fibrosis score 4, Batts & 
Ludwig score 3, or Scheuer score 3. 
Pegasys (groups A and C) was given for 48 weeks, dosed in line with that used in the pivotal paediatric 
hepatitis C-infection study (with no subjects included for the lowest BSA band):

For Group A, Group B non-switch, and Group C patients, the study duration was approximately 6 years 
(5 years of follow-up post treatment). For Group B switch patients, the total study duration was up to 
approximately 8 years to enable a 5 year follow-up post therapy. 
Criteria for Dose Modification or Withdrawal from Treatment  
Stopping rules and dose modifications were generally in line with the recommendations in the present 
Pegasys SmPC.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy analysis 
•  HBeAg seroconversion (loss of HBeAg and presence of anti-HBe), 24 weeks post therapy 
Patients with missing values of primary endpoint (including patients in group B who started PEG-IFN 
treatment prior to Week 24 of follow-up) were considered as non-responders.  
Sensitivity analyses were carried out with the approach of last observation carried forward (LOCF). An 
additional post-hoc analysis was also performed by excluding Group B patients who switched before 
Week 24 of follow-up from ITT population.  
Secondary efficacy analysis  
•  HBeAg seroconversion (outside the 24 week time point)  
•  HBsAg seroconversion (loss of HBsAg and presence of anti HBs) 
•  Loss of HBsAg (without development of anti-HBs) 
•  Proportion of patients with normal ALT 
•  Suppression of HBV-DNA to < 20,000 IU/mL, < 2,000 IU/mL, undetectable, and change from 
baseline. 
•  Combined endpoint of HBeAg seroconversion and HBV-DNA response  
•  Quantitative values of serum ALT, HBV-DNA, HBeAg, and HBsAg, and their change from 
baseline. 
Sample size 
161 patients, including at least 145 without advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis  
Randomisation 
151 patients without advanced fibrosis were enrolled and randomized (101 in Group A and 50 in Group 
B). An additional 10 patients with advanced fibrosis were enrolled in Group C. 
Stratification was performed by genotype (A vs. non-A) and ALT level (< 5 × the ULN vs. ≥ 5 × the 
ULN). Subjects with advanced fibrosis (assessed by liver biopsy performed within 9 months prior to 
baseline) were assigned to PEG-IFN treatment (Group C: advanced fibrotic arm).  
Treatment group assignment was centralized by Interactive Voice or Web Response System (IxRS).  
Statistical methods 
The estimates of the common odds ratio, adjusted by stratification factors, were reported accompanied 
by the associated 95% confidence intervals. 
P-values for the binary secondary efficacy endpoints were calculated using Fisher’s exact test. Efficacy 
assessments at later time points will be reported in the final CSR. Descriptive statistics were used to 
summarize safety parameters by group during the treatment/principal observation period and initial 24 
weeks of follow-up. Laboratory data not reported in International System of Units (SI units) were 
converted to SI units before further processing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 25/64 
 
 
For the growth analysis, the gender specific Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Growth 
Charts were used as reference to calculate the height (weight, BMI) for age percentile and height 
(weight, BMI) for age z-score.  
Safety assessments collected during the 4.5-year extended, long-term follow-up period will be 
reported in the final CSR. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended once prior to enrolment of the first patient. Subsequently, three 
amendments were implemented. 
With regard to the study design, CHMP noted that the treatment duration was that recommended for 
adults, and that Pegasys was dosed in children with the aim of mimicking the exposure in adults.  The 
choice of HBV-DNA level (>2000 IU/ml) used as inclusion criterion was discussed by CHMP (see 
further).  
CHMP also acknowledged that an important aspect of a long term follow-up is to further evaluate the 
effects of PEG-IFN on height development.  The data already generated and evaluated from children 
treated with PEG-IFN α2b (5 year follow-up presented) were considered trustworthy by CHMP when 
evaluating that aspect of safety, as it was considered that long term effects on height would not differ 
by the type of interferon used. 
The study endpoints were endorsed by CHMP.  
Results 
Baseline data 
211 patients were screened with 45 screening failures (not fulfilling entry criteria/not willing to 
participate). 
Asian sites recruited the highest number (76 randomized patients overall, 69 in China), followed by 
Europe (57 randomized patients, with 18 in the Russia and 13 in the Ukraine). Nine of the 10 patients 
with advanced fibrosis (Group C) were enrolled in Asia. 
As seen in the next two tables, main demographics and disease characteristics (including degree of 
ALT increase and HBV genotype) was fairly well balanced between arms A and B.

The inclusion criteria were considered liberal. A number of children had normal ALT levels at baseline, 
and around half had an ALT level of < 2 X ULN.  As expected, the majority had minimal fibrosis (F0 or 
F1). 
Disposition of subjects 
Out of 101 subjects in group A, 96 were treated for 45-48 weeks (1 for 3 months, 1 for 6 months and 
3 for just over 48 weeks). Out of the 10 with severe fibrosis (C), 9 received 45-48 weeks of therapy, 
and the 10th 49-52 weeks.  
Only 2 patients in Group A prematurely discontinued treatment; AE 1, physician decision 1 (treatment 
deemed unnecessary). Both patients completed Week 24 of follow-up. 
The disposition of group B, including decision to start therapy post week 48, is shown below. 
Loss of HBeAg at week 72 (48 weeks + 24 weeks of FU) was seen in 26% of those treated versus in 
3/50 (6%), table below) controls, where controls who had started treatment prior to this time point 
were counted as non-responders, as well as those without an assessment at this time point. Using a 
last observation carried forward with regards the latter increased the number of responders by 1 
patient in each group (26.7% vs. 8%).  
HBeAg loss was seen in 3/21 controls (14.3%) who did not start Pegasys prior to the assessment of 
the primary end point.

95% CI of response rate is calculated by Clopper-Pearson method. HBeAg/HBsAg seroconversion is defined as loss of these antigens 
and the presence of anti-HBe/anti-HBs 
In Group C, HBeAg seroconversion was observed in 3 (30.0%) patients (95% CI, 6.7%-65.3%) at 24 
weeks after the end of treatment period. 
CHMP noted that the overall HBe conversion rates in these children after 48 weeks of therapy were 
lower than those seen in adult patients in the pivotal studies of PEG-IFN α2a and 2b (HBeAg positive 
previously untreated patients). CHMP agreed that the difference was likely driven by the fairly large 
number of children included with next to normal ALT values (as a marker of minimal immune 
activation), and a very low response rate in children with genotype D. 
Per Protocol (PP) Population 
The PP population included 91 patients in group A and 43 patients in group B, others were excluded 
(10% and 14% respectively) for the below reasons. The rates of HBeAg seroconversion in the PP 
population remained similar (26 vs. 7%).

In Group C, HBeAg seroconversion was observed in 3 (30.0%) patients (95% CI, 6.7%-65.3%) at 24 
weeks after the end of treatment period. 
Efficacy in selected subgroups 
The following table shows HBeAg seroconversion rates by relevant baseline parameters. Many of them 
would be connected, such as race and HBV genotype (and not shown here, mode of transmission).  
Age wise, younger paediatric patients had improved efficacy response compared with older pediatric 
patients (HBeAg seroconversion rates: < 5 years [42.9%], 5-11 years [25.6%], > 12 years [20.8%]), 
in line with previous studies with IFNs that demonstrated better efficacy in younger pediatric patients 
(Sokal et al. 2013). It is noted that the response in patients with genotype D (most likely Caucasians 
in this study) was low. Likewise, those children with minimal ALT increases responded less well, in line 
with what is known from adults.

The inclusion criteria to this study were seen as liberal with regards to ALT levels to be included and 
the MAH was asked to discuss. It was clarified that the inclusion criteria used in study YV25718 were 
chosen to ensure patients were in the immune-active phase of the disease (i.e. defined by positive 
HBeAg, HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL, ALT elevated, active inflammation on liver biopsy [McMahon 2008]). 
The ALT criterion aligns with the previous adult Pegasys CHB studies. Moreover, this ALT inclusion 
criterion is consistent with the current treatment guidelines (i.e. AASLD [Terrault et al 2016], EASL 
[EASL 2017], APASL [Sarin et al 2016]), which state that patients with minimally elevated ALT levels 
(1-2 × ULN) can still be considered for treatment. Indeed, the European Society of Paediatric 
Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) 2013 paediatric CHB guideline treatment 
algorithm advocates liver biopsy and subsequent treatment consideration in children with elevated ALT 
levels (Sokal et al 2013). The indication wording now includes that there is evidence of persistently 
elevated ALT levels and included references to sections 4.4 and 5.1.  
Further, a fairly high number of children with genotype D were included, and results did not seem to 
favour the use of PEG-IFN therapy in that group (e.g. having side effects in mind). The MAH showed 
more details on these patients.

Patients enrolled in Europe (37.7% of the ITT population in study YV25718) accounted for a high 
proportion of the patients with genotype D infection (83.9% in Group A, 83.3% in Group B and 50.0% 
in Group C). Within the European region, most of the patients with genotype D infection were enrolled 
in Russia and the Ukraine (18/26 [69%]). The high prevalence of genotype D infection in these 
countries is in line with recent epidemiological observations (Bissinger et al 2015). 
Exploratory subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint of HBeAg seroconversion by genotype were 
supportive of a treatment benefit across HBV genotypes B, C and D.   In the case of HBV genotype A, 
an odds ratio (OR) of 1.0 was observed, but the number of patients with this genotype was too low (9 
in Group A and 3 in Group B) to enable a meaningful assessment of the treatment effect. In the 
specific case of HBV genotype D, which is considered as a less responsive genotype (Sunbul 2014), a

less profound treatment effect on HBeAg seroconversion rate was observed (9.7%) comparing to HBV 
genotypes B and C (33.3%-38.2%).  
The MAH also analysed to what extent factors other than genotype D may explain HBeAg 
seroconversion rate of <10% in this study. Baseline characteristics of the treated patients with HBV 
genotype D were compared with those with non-D genotypes to investigate whether any baseline 
factors that are predictive of worse response may have contributed to the lower response rate in HBV 
genotype D patients.

Differences of note included fewer patients infected with HBV genotype D versus non-D aged less than 
5 years (3/31 [9.7%] versus 11/70 [15.7%]), more patients with baseline ALT < 1xULN (6/31 
[19.4%] versus 1/70 [1.4%]) or with minimally elevated ALT (≥ 1xULN – 2xULN) (14/31 [45.2%] 
versus 27/70 [38.6%]), slightly higher baseline HBsAg level (mean log10[HBsAg+1] 4.70 versus 4.14), 
and baseline HBV-DNA (mean log 10[HBV-DNA+1] 8.55 versus 7.89). Baseline HBeAg level was similar 
(mean Log 10[HBeAg+1] 2.64 versus 2.77).  Since, in general, lower baseline ALT level, higher HBV-
DNA and higher HBsAg level are associated with poorer response to PEG-IFN treatment, these factors 
may have contributed to the lower HBeAg seroconversion rate observed in patients with HBV genotype 
D in YV25718 study.  
In a further effort to understand what factors may influence response in patients with genotype D, 
baseline and demographic characteristics of these patients were analyzed by whether patients 
achieved HBeAg seroconversion at Week 24 of follow-up. However, as only 3 out of 31 patients with 
genotype D experienced seroconversion, it was not possible to draw reliable conclusions from this 
analysis. The MAH further noted that the 9.7% response rate observed in the paediatric study 
YV25718 was in line with the results of a meta-analysis of pivotal and post-marketing data exclusively 
in patients treated with PEG-IFN, recently undertaken by the MAH, in which the response rate was 
10.3%. Despite the limitations of these analyses, CHMP agreed that genotype D will be included in the 
approved paediatric indication and that section 5.1 of the Pegasys SmPC will show response rates by 
genotype.

Furthermore, the MAH provided data on the treatment of HBV genotypes other than A-D. Despite the 
fact that the included numbers were low, CHMP agreed that the approved paediatric indication for 
Pegasys in CHB paediatric patients will also include these patients. 
Comparison of efficacy to that obtained in adult patients treated with PEG-IFN 
The indication for Pegasys in adult e-antigen positive patients was based on the results in study 
WV16240. This study evaluated PEG-IFN α2a + placebo or lamivudine versus lamivudine.  Additionally, 
a phase IV study (WV19432) compared the efficacy and safety of PEG-IFN α2a for 24 or 48 weeks at 
doses of 90 or 180 µg weekly for the same population. 
Notable differences in baseline demographics between the present pediatric study and these studies 
were the proportion of genotype D-infected (31% versus 3-7% in studies WV16240 and WV19432), 
baseline HBeAg-levels being 4-fold higher in the paediatric patients (2.87 in study YV25718 versus 
2.25 Log10 IU/mL in study WV16240), and the lack of cirrhotic patients in the paediatric study (around 
5% in the adult studies).

As already mentioned, the least favourable outcome in the paediatric study was seen in patients with 
genotype D-infection. When looking at published data for outcomes by genotype in HBeAg positive 
adult patients treated with PEG-IFN α 2a or 2b +/- lamivudine, for 48 weeks the following HBe

In summary, the number of children with genotype A was too small for a comparison, the outcome in 
genotype B and C was in line with that seen in adults, and the outcome in genotype D (9%) seems 
considerably lower. 
Time for HBeAg seroconversion 
In the paediatric patients HBeAg seroconversion largely occurred post-treatment, whereas in adults, 
HBeAg seroconversion was observed to increase similarly during and after treatment, figures below.

 HBeAg Seroconversion over Time: ITT Population (YV25718, pediatric) 
CHMP noted that a lower proportion of the children had an HBeAg seroconversion during treatment 
(around 7%, compared to around another 20% post treatment) and asked the MAH to discuss. It was 
clarified that timing of HBeAg seroconversion in study YV25718 occurred largely after the end of 
treatment in study YV25718 in contrast to the adult studies. Off-treatment serological and virological 
responses continued to increase at Year 1 of follow-up, similar to adult long-term follow-up study 
WV16866 which showed that HBeAg seroconversion rates continue to increase several years post PEG-
IFN treatment.

CHMP questioned during the procedure whether this late response in HBe seroconversion was a result 
of high baseline HBe levels in children. The MAH provided HBe- and HBV-DNA levels for studies 
YV25718 (paediatric) and WV16240 (adults), at baseline, during treatment and during follow-up, for all 
patients, and separate for the responders (HBe seroconverters). 
HBeAg seroconversion largely occured post-treatment in paediatric patients, whereas in adults, HBeAg 
seroconversion increased rapidly during early treatment and continued after treatment. This 
observation was further investigated by analysing individually the kinetics of the components of this 
composite endpoint. The presence of anti-HBe increased in paediatric patients and adults during and 
after treatment by Week 24 of follow-up. Likewise, mean HBeAg levels in paediatrics and adults 
declined during treatment to a minimum at Week 48 of treatment and slightly rebounded by Week 24 
of follow-up. The main observable difference was that baseline HBeAg levels were approximately 4-fold 
higher in paediatric patients compared to adults: 2.87 versus 2.25 log 10 IU/mL respectively.

Figure 6b) Paediatric Study YV25718 (Group A, PEG-INF Treatment) 
With regard to the HBV DNA Levels in adult and paediatric patients, it was clarified that PEG-IFN 
induces early reductions of viral DNA in serum (virological response) and viral DNA continues to 
decrease with treatment to rebound slightly post-treatment and stabilize to lower levels as compared 
with baseline or untreated control. The change in mean HBV DNA levels over time was of similar 
magnitude during treatment in both adults (study WV16240) and paediatric patients (study YV25718) 
with values moderately rebounding post-treatment. 
CHMP concluded that the mean baseline HBeAg levels were higher in the paediatric study compared 
with the levels observed in adults, and this may have affected the delayed HBe-seroconversion in 
paediatric responders compared with adult responders. The difference in decline of HBeAg and HBV 
DNA between responders and non-responders opens for predictions of the likelihood of response early 
during treatment (for example at week 12).

CHMP noted that an increased probability of HBsAg conversion was seen with Pegasys treatment, and 
asked the MAH to discuss during the procedure qHBsAg at baseline and on-treatment as a predictor of 
HBsAg loss, as well as other disease and demographic predictors of HBsAg loss, as well as potential 
on-treatment predictors. Exploratory analyses of data from study YV25718 provided by the MAH 
showed that although baseline qHBsAg was not a predictor for HBeAg seroconversion, HBV-DNA<2000 
IU/mL and HBsAg loss at Week 24 of follow-up, lower on-treatment qHBsAg (at Week 12 or Week 24) 
were associated with higher likelihood of achieving serological or virological response. Furthermore on-
treatment qHBeAg, baseline BMI, BSA and baseline HBV-DNA level were shown by the exploratory 
analyses to be associated of HBsAg loss at Week 24 of follow-up.  
CHMP acknowledged this and agreed that interpretation of these findings needs to be treated with 
caution given the limited amount of data and the exploratory nature of the analyses. 
At request of the CHMP the MAH provided an analysis regarding HBV-DNA as an on-treatment 
predictor of response in HBeAg positive children. Low numbers were acknowledged.   
Treatment response (HBeAg seroconversion) by change in HBV-DNA up to Week 12 of treatment (<1 
log 10 decline, >1 but <2 log 10 decline, >2 log 10 decline) is presented in the following table.

The Applicant evaluated the performance characteristics (NPV, sensitivity, specificity) as a predictor of 
response using decline in HBV DNA of <1 log 10 or <2 log 10 at Week 12 by genotype in paediatric 
patients.  
In addition, the predictive values of the parameters derived in the adult meta-analysis were tested on 
the paediatric data set; HBV DNA >8 log 10 IU/mL and HBsAg >20,000 IU/mat at week 12, restricted to 
genotypes B and C.  
It is acknowledged that statistical analyses around stopping rules were based on small numbers and 
should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the response at week 24 in those with <1 log10 
decline in HBV-DNA at week 12 (seen in overall 44/101 patients) seems poor, and the chance to

achieve a response is considered more decent in those with >2 log10 decline at week 12 (seen in 
30/101 patients). Of note, the safety profile of peg-IFN is problematic, therapy is long and the disease 
course is mild in the vast majority of children. For transparency and to support an informed decision 
who to treat, at request of the CHMP, the data reflected in the table above are presented and 
commented in section 5.1 of the Pegasys SmPC. 
Liver Elasticity Substudy 
Liver Stiffness Measure (LSM) was assessed at baseline, Week 48 and Week 24 of follow-up in 75 
patients (44 in Group A, 25 in Group B and 6 in Group C).  Baseline data were available for 68 patients 
(40 in Group A, 22 in Group B and 6 in Group C) and data at Week 24 of follow-up were available for 
53 patients (42 in Group A, 5 in Group B [the lower number is due to patients who switched to 
treatment with PEG-IFN at the end of the principal observation period], and 6 in Group C).  
At baseline, median LSMs were similar across subgroups according to age, BMI and fibrosis score 
(range 4.9-6.6 kPa) and slightly higher in patients with advanced fibrosis (7.1 kPa).  
LSM values steadily declined during PEG-IFN therapy in contrast to untreated patients, where values 
increased to Week 48, suggesting an improvement in underlying liver histology of PEG-IFN treated 
paediatric patients. 
CHMP agreed that the outcome in the liver elasticity substudy was expected, i.e. to see a lowering of 
LSM values as an effect of therapy, likely as a consequence of lowered inflammation (rather than 
fibrosis during this short time span). The values seen at baseline in patients with “advanced fibrosis” 
indicate a slight mismatch as compared to LSM values presented in HBV-infected adults with F3 fibrosis 
(where 7.1 kPa would be equivalent to F2 fibrosis).  
2.4.2.  Discussion and conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The main goal of PEG-IFN therapy in HBeAg positive HBV infection is to shorten the immune active 
phase, i.e. to shorten the time to HBeAg seroconversion in patients who have entered the immune 
active stage, in order to prevent development of liver fibrosis, and reach a low viral replication. The 
overall HBeAg seroconversion rate seen in children in study YV25718 is comparable, although 
somewhat lower, to rates obtained in adult patients. Similar to adults, response rates were low in 
those children with the lowest baseline ALT increases. Therefore, the ALT inclusion criterion that was 
used in the study was discussed by CHMP; a repeated value, at least 2 weeks apart, higher than the  
upper limit of normal prior to study entry (maximum 6 months from the first sample). It was clarified 
that the inclusion criteria used in study YV25718 were chosen to ensure patients were in the immune-
active phase of the disease.  The ALT criterion aligns with the previous adult Pegasys CHB studies and 
is consistent with the current treatment guidelines. Nevertheless, to ensure that children with a low 
need for therapy and low probability of response are not treated in clinical practice, section 4.1 of the 
SmPC was revised, to clarify that the indication only concerns HBeAg positive children with persistently 
raised ALT levels (i.e. marker of immune active phase) and includes references to sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 5.1. 
The HBeAg seroconversion rate in children infected with HBV subtype D was very low (around 10%), 
and lower than results yielded in adults (20-25%).  
The MAH was asked to elaborate on whether the viral subtype per se seems to explain this finding, or 
whether other baseline factors (such as normal or minimally increased ALT levels) were seen in these 
children as compared to the others. CHMP agreed that the latter seemed to at least partially explain 
the very low response rate in this study, indirectly linked to difference in opinion around who to 
Assessment report

treat/recruit by region. Of note, the difference in response rates by genotype has been less marked in 
adult studies. A genotype specific indication is not deemed necessary. Upon request the data is 
transparently presented in the Pegasys SmPC (section 5.1).   
CHMP noted that an increased probability of HBsAg conversion was seen with Pegasys treatment. 
Exploratory analysis of data from study YV25718 showed that baseline qHBsAg was not a predictor for 
HBeAg seroconversion, HBV-DNA levels and HBsAg loss at Week 24 of follow-up.  
The time for HBe seroconversion in relation to therapy differed markedly in these children versus in 
adults. In adults treated for 48 weeks seroconversion was for the most achieved during therapy, with 
an additional 5% or so during the next 12 weeks of follow-up, and no further increase thereafter. In 
the paediatric study the HBe conversion rate at week 48 was low (around 8%), increasing to around 
18% at 12 weeks FU and to 26% at 24 weeks of follow-up. It may be that this is explained by the very 
high HBV (and HbeAg) levels at baseline in children. The proportion of responders at 48 of FU was 
presented during the procedure. The trend of increasing response rates was maintained in Group A 
(n=101), at 1 year of follow up 32/101 had achieved HBeAg seroconversion. The study has a 5 year 
follow-up, and the pattern of HBV replication and the frequency of flares/relapses back to immune 
activation over time is important to follow. 
The difference in decline of HBeAg and HBV-DNA between responders and non-responders opens for 
predictions of the likelihood of response early during treatment. Despite the exploratory nature of the 
analyses and small n numbers, the response in patients with lower decline in HVB-DNA at week 12 
seemed poorer compared to those patients who achieved a steeper decline in HBV-DNA. For 
transparency, this is reflected in section 5.1 of the Pegasys SmPC. 
Outcomes of interest in study YV25718 have been presented at the AASLD conference 2016, and will 
be presented as full length journal article, planned to be published within 2017. Overall, efficacy of 
PEG-IFN alpha 2a given for 48 weeks yielded similar results in HBeAg-positive children as previously 
shown in adult patients. It is therefore considered an option for the treatment of carefully selected 
children, where attention should be paid to updated HBV treatment guidelines. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The (somewhat problematic) safety profile of Pegasys in adult patients is well known. Data are also 
available from a limited number of children who were treated for hepatitis C-infection as part of clinical 
trials. Throughout the safety assessment below, comparisons are made to adult data, which were 
presented as part of the application. For adult data, reference is made to the two pivotal studies of 
Pegasys for the treatment of CHB (WV16140 and WV16141, concerning HBeAg positive and HBeAg 
negative patients, respectively). With regards to prior paediatric data the MAH refers to the paediatric 
study NV17424 (Pegasys +/- ribavirin for 48 weeks for the treatment of hepatitis C in children). 
NV17424 enrolled 114 children/adolescents aged 5-18 years, whereof 31 received Pegasys 
monotherapy for 48 weeks. However, during that study different terms were used when reporting AEs, 
and different reference values/methods were used for the assessment of some lab parameters. In 
addition, children were given either ribavirin (an agent associated with a number of side effects) or 
placebo in addition to a. This may have influenced the reporting of AEs (also in the placebo arm). In 
summary, since the number of patients in that paediatric study was also fairly low, a comparison is 
mainly done to the adult data with regard to safety. 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 43/64 
 
 
A specific issue for interferon therapy in children is the risk of a negative impact on length 
development, in particular when treatment is given during the growth spurt in during puberty. This risk 
is already highlighted in the Pegasys SmPC (as Pegasys is already approved for the treatment of 
hepatitis C infection in children aged 5 and above).  
Conclusions on the impact of PEG-IFN therapy on final height needs long term follow-up. Such 5-year 
data have been presented to the Agency and have as well been published (Haber et al, 2017) for 
children who were treated for hepatitis C with PEG-IFN α2b. The analysis of these data showed that a 
substantial proportion of children have a rather profound decrease in height per age percentiles, and 
that no relevant catch up in length is seen beyond 2 years of follow-up. In a short summary, 40% 
(19/48) of the children had a > 15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment to the end of 
5 year long-term follow-up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentiles;  13% (6/48) had a 
decrease from pre-treatment baseline > 30% height-for-age decrease. This is equivalent to a 
reduction of around 4 cm and 6-10 cm in final height. The Pegasys MAH has also previously shown 
such data for children treated for hepatitis C with a (PED-C study). Unfortunately, the interpretation of 
long term follow-up data in this case was hampered by a high rate of loss to follow-up. Out of 114 
patients treated in that study, screening for long term FU was done for 57 patients who had been 
treated for 48 weeks, of whom 23 patients completed the 5-year follow-up. As there is no mechanistic 
reason to believe that the impact of different PEG-IFNs-alfa on growth differ, data on the impact of 
height obtained with other IFNs need to guide the interpretation of this safety issue until the Pegasys 
MAH generates and presents more substantial data for assessment.  
The safety data from study YV25718 is presented in the following. 
Patient exposure 
111 patients were included. 105 patients were administered Pegasys for the planned duration; 2 
stopped early and 4 were treated somewhat longer (49-52 weeks). 
Adverse events 
The overall AE frequencies, below, are similar to those seen in adults. Of note, only 1 single patient 
stopped therapy due to an AE, a low figure as compared to that rate in adult studies.

Note: The table was made on the basis of AEs reported in the adult studies, and terms not listed but reported in the 
paediatric study were added on the lower rows (vomiting and rows below). 
Around half of the patients in the present study were below the age of 12. Of the most frequently 
reported individual terms in Group A (patients without severe fibrosis), the following were reported 
more frequently in patients aged <12 compared with patients ≥12 years of age:  
• 
• 
• 
pyrexia (68% vs 27%) 
cough (19% vs 8%) 
vomiting (21% vs 6%) and rash (15% vs 4%)  
In contrast, the following events were reported more frequently in patients of ≥12 years of age:  
• 
headache (35% vs 25%)  
influenza-like illness (23% vs 8%) 
Serious Adverse Events 
6/111 (5%) of patients in groups A+C  experienced  SAEs, none of which caused a stop of treatment, 
and all had resolved by 24 weeks of FU; the age was above 12 years in 4 out of 6 cases.

•  4 Infections: HBV 1, Latent TB 1, Micosporum infection 1, Tonsillitis 1 
•  1 ALT/AST increased 
•  1 osteochondrosis 
Of note, in the CHB adult pivotal studies, 27 patients (6%) experienced SAEs in the PEG-IFN 
monotherapy arm. 
Adverse Events that Led to Withdrawal of Study Treatment 
One patient (1%) withdrew from study treatment due to a non-serious AE. The patient, a 5-year-old 
girl, experienced increased ALT and AST (> 10 x ULN) which were considered related to the study drug 
by the investigator. The event resolved after 8 weeks. 
Of note, in the CHB adult pivotal studies, 21 patients (5%) in the PEG-IFN monotherapy arms 
discontinued study treatment prematurely for safety reasons. 
Adverse Events and Laboratory Abnormalities that Led to Dose Modification 
of Study Treatment 
Twenty-nine patients (26%) experienced an AE or laboratory abnormality that led to a dose 
modification Lab concerns low neutrophils, 14 (13%) or increased ALT levels, 13 (12%), and AEs 
concerned pyrexia, disturbance in attention and learning disorder, abdominal pain, neutropenia, and 
infection (respiratory tract infection and varicella). 
Of note, in study WV16240 (adults, HBeAg-positive) 40% had dose modifications in the PEG-IFN 
monotherapy arm, mainly due to neutropenia, 22%, and ALT increase, 12%.  
The proportion of young patients in need of dose modifications was similar or lower than the proportion 
seen in adult studies. This is further discussed under the “laboratory abnormalities” subheading. 
AEs of special interest 
Ophthalmological Disorders 
13/111 patients (12%) reported an eye disorder during the study, none serious, of which 4 were 
considered to be related to study drug (eye pain, eyelid edema, retinal hemorrhage and retinal 
edema). None of these events led to discontinuation of PEG-IFN or dose modification.   
Of note, in the CHB adult pivotal studies 7% experienced eye disorders in the PEG-IFN monotherapy 
arm, most commonly blurred vision (2%) and eye pain (2%).  In the CHC pediatric study, eye 
disorders were reported for 8 patients (15%) in the PEG-IFN plus RBV combination arm, and 7 patients 
(23%) in the PEG-IFN monotherapy arm, most commonly conjunctivitis (4% and 19%) and eye pain 
(2% and 3%). 
Psychiatric / neurologic events 
Twelve patients (11%) reported a psychiatric disorder; depressed mood and depression were reported 
in one patient each. Both these events were considered related to study treatment, were mild and had 
resolved by the end of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 46/64 
 
 
 
 
41 patients (37%) reported a nervous system disorder, mainly headache (31%). 
Of note, in the CHB adult pivotal studies, 17% of patients reported psychiatric disorders in the PEG-IFN 
monotherapy arms, mainly insomnia (8%) and depression (4%).   
Thyroid Disorders, including lab abnormalities 
Two patients (2%) had increased TSH reported as AEs; no other AEs related to thyroid function 
occurred. The events resolved without treatment, without modification or discontinuation from 
treatment with PEG-IFN: 
• 
• 
The first patient had a single high TSH value at Week 48 and positive TPO antibody at Week 24 
and Week 48, but FT3 and FT4 within normal range.  
The second patient had FT3, FT4 and TSH values outside normal range and positive TPO 
antibody during treatment; high FT3 was detected at baseline, and FT3, FT4 and TSH returned 
to normal range by Week 24 of follow-up.  
Of note, in the CHB adult pivotal studies, 3 patients (<1%) experienced hypothyroidism and 6 patients 
(1%) experienced hyperthyroidism (i.e. reported as AEs). 
46 patients (41%) had at least one post-baseline thyroid lab abnormality (at least one value of FT3, 
FT4 or TSH outside of the normal range up to Week 24 of follow-up). The most frequently reported 
value was high FT3, which was reported in 40 patients (36%).  Of note, 15 patients (37.5%) had a 
high FT3 abnormality at baseline.  14 patients (13%) had last or replicated high FT3 abnormality. None 
of the patients had high FT4 abnormalities or reported an event of hyperthyroidism.

Six patients (5.4%) had low TSH abnormalities, all single events and without FT4 3 increases at the 
same time point. High TSH levels were observed in 7 patients and in 2 this was reported as an AE 
(mentioned above).   
No thyroid function laboratory abnormality led to dose modification.  Four PEG-IFN-treated patients 
reported TPO antibodies, two of whom had all FT3, FT4 and TSH values within normal range; the other 
two patients had TSH value above normal and reported AEs, as mentioned.  
In summary, the majority of thyroid laboratory abnormalities were isolated and single events of high 
FT3 values not accompanied by TSH or FT4 abnormalities. None of these abnormalities was reported as 
an AE, except two high TSH abnormalities AEs which did not require treatment.

Despite the rather high incidence of lab abnormalities (including at baseline) seen in this study, since 
the risk for thyroid disorder during/following therapy with interferons is well established and is already 
handled in the Pegasys SmPC, and despite noting difficulties in comparing the results to the adult ones 
and to the ones generated in the paediatric CHC study, CHMP considered that further discussion on the 
topic was not warranted.  
Laboratory abnormalities 
Only lab chemistry of higher interest is discussed below. No clinically relevant changes were seen in 
haemoglobin or creatinine and thyroid parameters were discussed above. 
Neutrophils 
Interferons carry a well-established risk for neutropenia. Below the lowest post-baseline neutrophil 
count for groups A+C are shown. These changes reversed by Week 24 of follow-up, and no patient had 
a neutrophil count below 0.25 x 109 cells/L at any time during the treatment and 24-week follow-up 
periods. Neutrophil counts less than 0.75 x 109 cells/L were clinically manageable with appropriate 
dose modifications. As seen previously, no severe infections were reported during the study. The 
occurrence and degree of neutropenia is in line with that seen in the adult studies.

days of baseline. The highest post-baseline values greater than 5.0 × ULN were reported in 65 patients 
(59%) in the pooled safety population. For most patients with post-baseline ALT ≥ 5.0 × ULN, ALT 
levels returned/were returning to baseline at Week 24 of follow-up except for 2 patients, who had a 
peak ALT value at Week 24 of follow-up but with normal bilirubin.   
None of the ALT flares met the modified Hy’s law criteria and there was no evidence of hepatic 
decompensation. Modified HY´s law criteria were defined as ALT or AST > 3 x baseline value in 
combination with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or with clinical jaundice, ALP levels not taken into account. 
The following table shows that the pattern (frequency, level and time for event) of ALT flares was 
similar in the paediatric and adult patients in the pivotal studies, YV25718 and WV16140.

Platelets 
Post-baseline platelet counts in the range of 50.0- ≤75.0× 109 cells/L and 20.0 - ≤50.0 × 109 cells/L 
(this event reported as AE) were reported in one patient each.  In both cases, platelet counts 
recovered to normal range without any dose reductions, without any bleeding events during the study. 
The frequency of thrombocytopenia has been higher in adult patients (likely driven by cirrhotic patients 
which were not included in the present paediatric study).

As previously mentioned (Adverse Events and Laboratory Abnormalities that Led to Dose Modification 
of Study Treatment), the proportion of patients in need of dose modifications for reasons of 
neutropenia and ALT increases was similar or lower as compared to what was seen in adult studies. In 
the Pegasys SmPC, specific dose modifications are recommended in the case of neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia (at present only for adults), and ALT increases. CHMP noted that the present PI 
recommendations are somewhat different for adults and paediatric patients (presently age 5 and 
above) and that in addition in the present study protocol somewhat different rules were applied. CHMP 
considered that the MAH initial proposal could result in a complicated SmPC and has asked for further 
clarification.  
With regard to the dose modification for low neutrophil counts, the MAH explained the reasons for 
which the dose modification recommendations differ in case of neutropenia between adult and 
paediatric patients and within the paediatric population between CHB and CHC patients. For children a 
more conservative approach in line with that used in the pivotal paediatric studies (NV17424 and 
YV25718) is proposed. CHMP considered that it is reasonable to use this conservative approach for 
children and to maintain the adult recommendations, which are well established since the Pegasys 
initial marketing authorization. The MAH proposal was endorsed by CHMP. 
CHMP further noted that the differences in the recommendations proposed for children with CHB and 
CHC were minor and requested that a harmonized recommendation should be acceptable and should 
not impact the benefit-risk. Recommendations for dose modifications for CHB were also applied for 
children with CHC in the Pegasys PI. It was also agreed that ANC cut-off intervals should be 
maintained and should also be included for the adult population.

With regard to the dose modification for low platelet counts, the MAH highlighted that the approved 
rules for discontinuation and dose-modification scheme for low platelet counts in adults are essentially 
the same as those in paediatric patients. The MAH has however proposed changes to the 
recommendations for adults in the SmPC for consistency. The interval 25,000 to < 50,000 should be 
used instead of merely < 50,000 to decrease the risk for medication errors. CHMP agreed to this 
proposal. 
With regard to the dose modification recommendation for high ALT levels, CHMP agreed that the 
differences observed between adults and children are justified by a more conservative approach 
applied for the paediatric population.

Height 
Z-Scores 
In the pooled safety population (Group A + Group C), the mean change from baseline in the height for 
age Z-score (which expresses the given variable as a number of standard deviations below or above 
the reference mean value of a given age and sex) was -0.01 at Week 24, -0.07 at Week 48 on 
treatment, and -0.10 at Week 24 of Follow-up.  Similar changes were observed in the untreated Group 
B (-0.07, -0.01, and -0.08, respectively).  
Changes in Percentile 
Mean height for age percentile showed little variation throughout the study in the pooled safety 
population; 59.4 at baseline, 58.1 Week 48 of treatment, and 56.8 at Week 24 of follow-up time-
points. At Week 48 of treatment, the proportion of patients with > 15% drop in height for age 
percentile was 6%, and by Week 24 of follow-up, this proportion was 12%. In the untreated Group B, 
the mean height for age percentile was 49.7 at baseline, 50.2 at Week 48 of the principal observation 
period, and 53.6 at Week 24 of follow-up. The proportion of patients in group B with > 15% drop in 
the height for age percentile was 2% at Week 48 principal observation period, and 7% by Week 24 of 
follow-up.  
CHMP noted that it is already established that the treatment of children/adolescents with IFN carries a 
risk for a reduced final height (see introduction to Safety section), and that the risk for non-reversible 
decreases in mean height percentiles (i.e. without a substantial catch-up when treatment is stopped) is 
most likely highest when therapy is given a time of the growth spurt during puberty.  
CHMP also noted that the reduction in height for age percentiles in this study seemed lower than in the 
previous study undertaken in CHC patients (see introduction to safety). It was discussed that the 
differences in reductions at post treatment follow-up between studies could be a result of the

proportions of individuals most vulnerable (linked to age/growth spurts). Although CHMP agreed that 
this issue needed long term follow-up, the MAH was asked to provide scatter plots and box plots on 
changes in height for age percentiles by baseline age, from BL to week 48 and from BL to 24 weeks 
FU, using pooled data from the present study (YV25718) and from the previous paediatric study in 
CHC infected patients (N17424) and to redo the exercise in later presentations of long term data 
(presumably 2- and 5-years follow-up). The age categories to be used for the box plots were agreed to 
be 3-5 years, 6-8 years, 9-12 years, 13-15 years and 16-17 years. In addition to the analyses 
requested, the MAH also analysed these data by gender and for each study separately. Finally, in a 
further effort to understand the potential effect of PEG-IFN on growth during puberty, the MAH 
conducted additional height-for-age percentile analyses using gender-specific age ranges for puberty.  
The MAH provided the requested additional information. Although there was no apparent pattern of 
percentile change from baseline that could give further guidance to the prescriber in addition to the 
existing boxed warning with regards to growth and development, CHMP agreed that a greater risk of 
growth impairment especially during puberty cannot be ruled out and considered that the current 
wording in section 4.4 of the Pegasys SmPC “Whenever possible the child should be treated after the 
pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the risk of growth inhibition” was adequate.  
Post-Marketing Experience in Paediatric Patients  
In total, 355 cases (727 AEs) involving paediatric patients treated with PEG-IFN were identified in the 
safety database. These cases involved mostly adolescents (aged ≥12 to < 18 years; 196 [55.2%]) and 
children (aged ≥2 years to <12 years; 117 [33.0%]); 39 cases (11.0%) were from children aged 3 to 
5 years. The reported cases concerned primarily paediatric patients treated with PEG-IFN for CHC (168 
cases [47%]).  
The AEs that were reported were those typically seen/reported in the adult studies and in the 
paediatric studies discussed in this report. No new safety signals were seen. 
2.5.1.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical safety 
Apart from the risk of reduced height, the safety profile of a in these 111 children (around half below 
the age of 12, and 18 children (16%) below the age of 5) seems broadly similar to the safety profile 
reported in adults. The frequency of the most common AEs (pyrexia and headache) was reported in 
similar frequencies as in adults, while other typical AEs (such as fatigue) were reported in lower 
frequencies, perhaps because terms are interpreted differently, or may be hard to ask about. 
The rate of neuropsychiatric events in the present study was similar or lower to that seen in adults; 
there were two reported depressive episodes; both were mild and resolved without the halt of therapy. 
No severe infections were seen, and the frequency and degree of neutropenia was similar or lower 
than that seen in adults. ALT flares, as a marker of HBV clearance, were seen in similar frequencies 
and severities as in adults. 
Only one patient stopped therapy due to an AE (ALT increase >10 x ULN) and the event resolved. 
Specific SmPC recommendations for which levels of lab abnormalities (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
ALT increases) should trigger dose reductions were clarified.  
A main issue for the use of peg-IFN in children is the risk for a shortened final height, in particular 
when treatment is given at the time of growth spurt in puberty (i.e. no chance for catch up post 
treatment). In the present study 6.5% of the children had a >15% reduction in height for age 
percentiles during treatment (12% at 24 weeks post treatment FU). In a prior study with peg-IFN 2a 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 52/64 
 
 
 
 
 
+/- ribavirin for the treatment of CHC in children aged 5-18 years, 13/68 (20%) had a >15% decrease 
in this parameter at that time point, and in a prior study with PEG-IFN 2b (CHC, paediatric population) 
the figure was around 40%, where it was already shown that this reduction remained long term. There 
is presently no data to support that there is any relevant difference between interferons with regards 
the risk for height reductions. Differences in reductions at post treatment follow-up between studies 
would likely rather be a result of proportions of individuals most vulnerable (i.e. at growth spurt during 
puberty when treated).  
Pooled data from the CHB and CHC studies in children were analysed by gender and for each study 
separately. Moreover, the MAH has provided height-for-age percentile analyses using gender-specific 
age ranges for puberty. Although there was no apparent pattern of percentile change from baseline 
that could give further guidance to the prescriber in addition to the existing boxed warning with 
regards to growth and development, CHMP agreed that a greater risk of growth impairment especially 
during puberty cannot be ruled out and that the current wording in section 4.4 of the SmPC “Whenever 
possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the risk of 
growth inhibition” is considered adequate.  
One additional amendment to Section 4.4 of the SmPC is inserted to clarify that growth inhibition is 
not only an issue with combination therapy but also Pegasys monotherapy. 
CHMP noted that the box warning in section 4.4 of the Pegasys SmPC referring to “growth and 
development” ended with a wording stating that “there are no data on long-term effects on sexual 
maturation” and discussed the validity of this statement. To date, no data on the effect of Pegasys on 
sexual maturation are available. CHMP also noted that Tanner stages will be recorded for assessing 
sexual maturation in the ongoing study NV25361, which has a follow-up of 5 years after end of 48 
weeks of treatment with PEG-IFN in combination with lamivudine or entecavir (for 56 weeks) 
compared with untreated controls (114 paediatric patients in total). It was acknowledged that no data 
were available for IFN α2b that and only limited data were available for PEG-IFN α2b. CHMP agreed to 
leave the current wording unchanged until more data is available. 
2.5.2.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8.3 is acceptable. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 8.3 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
Changes to the Pegasys SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 are introduced. The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant. The changes of the Product Information have been 
assessed as not requiring the need for a specific consultation. This was considered acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
In study YV25718, Pegasys was administered for 48 weeks to 111 children aged 3-17 with HBeAg 
positive CHB and ALT levels above the normal (prior to entry), indicative for entrance to the immune 
active stage. A control group of 50 children received no treatment but had the chance to start therapy 
after the week 48 time point. Around half of the patients were below the age of 12, and again, around 
half had an ALT elevation at baseline of < 2 X ULN. 
3.1.  Favourable effects 
The vast majority of children with CHB do have a spontaneous HBe seroconversion after the entrance 
to the immune active phase, when followed long term (80-100%, see introduction section 2.1), 
although very few have an immune clearance (HBs seroconversion). However, in those responding to 
PEG-IFN treatment, the immune active stage(which precedes the HBe seroconversion) is shortened 
and the risk of fibrosis development is consequently lowered. The overall response rate (i.e. HBe 
seroconversion at 24 weeks post treatment) of 26% is similar, or somewhat lower than that seen in 
adult studies. The Odds ratio for HBe seroconversion in the treated vs. the untreated patients was 
around 5 in this study (at 6 months follow-up); the immune clearance rate (HBsAg seroconversion) is 
low also with therapy, but considerably higher than in the untreated patients in this study (8% vs. 0% 
at 24 weeks of follow-up).

3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It is well known that response rates differ by HBV genotype. Of those genotypes studied (mainly A-D), 
genotype D, the one at least historically most prevalent in southern parts of Europe, the one at least 
historically most prevalent in southern parts of Europe, and also in Eastern Europe/Russia responds 
less well to PEG-IFN therapy. In adults treated with 48 weeks of peg-IFN the HBe seroconversion rates 
were around 20-25% for this genotype as compared to 30-40% for the others. In the present study 
only 10% (3/31) of the genotype D-infected patients responded to therapy (table next page). To what 
extent this very low figure was an effect of the genotype per se, or other negative predictive factors 
potentially over represented in that subpopulation in this study was further explored. It was noted that 
normal to minimally increased ALT levels were more frequent in these children. HBeAg levels were also 
higher, potentially reflecting that children with subtype D (mainly included in Russia and Ukraine) to a 
greater extent were included despite not having entered the immune active stage. Hence, other factors 
than subtype per se may at least in part explain the very low response rate in genotype D-infection in 
the present study. 
Exploratory subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint of HBeAg seroconversion by genotype were 
supportive of a treatment benefit across HBV genotypes B, C and D.   In the case of HBV genotype A, 
an odds ratio (OR) of 1.0 was observed, but the number of patients with this genotype was too low (9 
in Group A and 3 in Group B) to enable a meaningful assessment of the treatment effect. In the 
specific case of HBV genotype D, which is considered as a less responsive genotype (Sunbul 2014), a 
less profound treatment effect on HBeAg seroconversion rate was observed (9.7%) comparing to HBV 
genotypes B and C (33.3%-38.2%).  
The MAH also analysed to what extent factors other than genotype D may explain HBeAg 
seroconversion rate of <10% in this study. Baseline characteristics of the treated patients with HBV 
genotype D were compared with those with non-D genotypes to investigate whether any baseline 
factors that are predictive of worse response may have contributed to the lower response rate in HBV 
genotype D patients. 
The inclusion criteria to this study could have been seen as liberal with regards to ALT levels to be 
included and during what time span prior to baseline at the MAH was asked to discuss. It was clarified 
that the inclusion criteria used in study YV25718 were chosen to ensure patients were in the immune-
active phase of the disease (i.e. defined by positive HBeAg, HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL, ALT elevated, 
active inflammation on liver biopsy [McMahon 2008]). The ALT criterion aligns with the previous adult 
Pegasys CHB studies. Moreover, this ALT inclusion criterion is consistent with the current treatment 
guidelines (i.e. AASLD [Terrault et al 2016], EASL [EASL 2017], APASL [Sarin et al 2016]), which state 
that patients with minimally elevated ALT levels (1-2 × ULN) can still be considered for treatment. 
Indeed, the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) 
2013 paediatric CHB guideline treatment algorithm advocates liver biopsy and subsequent treatment 
consideration in children with elevated ALT levels (Sokal et al 2013). Upon CHMP request, the MAH 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 60/64 
 
 
 
revised section 4.1 of the Pegasys SmPC to highlight that the indication concerns children with 
persistently elevated ALT levels (i.e. the marker for entrance to the immune active stage) and included 
references to sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1. Also, the response at week 12 of therapy (HBV-DNA decline 
from baseline) seemed predictive for e-antigen seroconversion (aim of therapy). Although the data is 
too limited and variable to provide a definite stopping rule, the data is presented as part of section 5.1 
of the Pegasys SmPC for transparency.   
Since, in general, lower baseline ALT level, higher HBV-DNA and higher HBsAg level are associated 
with poorer response to PEG-IFN treatment, these factors may have contributed to the lower HBeAg 
seroconversion rate observed in patients with HBV genotype D in YV25718 study. In a further effort to 
understand what factors may influence response in patients with genotype D, baseline and 
demographic characteristics of these patients were analyzed by whether patients achieved HBeAg 
seroconversion at Week 24 of follow-up. However, as only 3 out of 31 patients with genotype D 
experienced seroconversion, it was not possible to draw reliable conclusions from this analysis. The 
MAH further noted that the 9.7% response rate observed in the paediatric study YV25718 was in line 
with the results of a meta-analysis of pivotal and post-marketing data exclusively in patients treated 
with PEG-IFN, recently undertaken by the MAH, in which the response rate was 10.3%. Despite the 
limitations of these analyses, CHMP agreed that genotype D will be included in the approved paediatric 
indication and that section 5.1 of the Pegasys SmPC will show response rates by genotype. 
Furthermore, the MAH provided data on the treatment of HBV genotypes other than A-D. Despite the 
fact that the included numbers were low, CHMP agreed that the approved paediatric indication for 
Pegasys in CHB paediatric patients will also include these patients. 
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
Treatment with IFNs carries a long list of well-established and common side effects, including 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, influenza-like side effects and neuropsychiatric side effect. The 
frequency and severity of these side effects seems similar in children compared to adults. Of note, the 
comparison of subjective side effects in children and adults should be done cautiously, since the 
reporting and understanding of such events for small children is certainly not easy. Furthermore, there 
is a risk of inducing autoimmune disorders, of which thyroid disease is most prevalent. 
On top of the side effects seen in adults, children are at risk for a reduced final length. Length per age 
percentiles is substantially reduced during therapy. That was shown for both non-pegylated interferons 
and PEG-IFN α2a and 2b. Long term follow-up (5 years) was so far more successfully performed in 
children treated with PEG-IFN α2b than for children treated with PEG-IFN α2a (Pegasys), both in the 
treatment of hepatitis C-infection. For the former PEG-IFN α2b, it was shown that impaired growth 
largely recovered posttreatment following 24 weeks of therapy, but only partially so for those treated 
for 48 weeks. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Effects on length in children treated with IFNs and recovery rates post treatment differ between 
studies, including in cross-study comparisons of PEG-IFN α2a. Available data does not provide 
sufficient evidence for a differential risk between interferons, and there is still a need to collect further 
long term data after treatment with PEG-IFN α2a. Study YV25718 aims to follow all patients for 5 
years post treatment. It is important that the MAH makes all efforts to minimize the loss to follow-up, 
so that the issue of impact on height can be adequately followed, in addition to following the course of 
the hepatitis B-infection in responders as well as non-responders. As part of the present procedure the 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 61/64 
 
 
company was asked to further elaborate on length impairment by age at starting PEG-IFN therapy; an 
exercise that should be repeated in future follow-ups of this study. 
The MAH provided the requested additional information. Although there was no apparent pattern of 
percentile change from baseline that could give further guidance to the prescriber in addition to the 
existing boxed warning with regards to growth and development, CHMP agreed that a greater risk of 
growth impairment especially during puberty cannot be ruled out and considered that the current 
wording in section 4.4 of the Pegasys SmPC “Whenever possible the child should be treated after the 
pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the risk of growth inhibition” was adequate. 
3.5.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.5.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
CHB runs a benign disease course in most children, and the risk for developing significant/more severe 
fibrosis during childhood is low also without treatment. In many cases therapy can therefore be 
deferred (also if ALT levels are somewhat increased), having side effects and moderate efficacy in 
mind. In cases where treatment is deemed to be adequate, the efficacy of PEG-IFN α2a is likely similar 
to that seen in adults. For those, (around 25% responding to therapy) there is a decreased risk of 
fibrosis development, and in longer term, a decreased risk of hepatocellular cancer. The response rate 
was correlated to the level of ALT increase at baseline, which is well established from studies in adults. 
Following questions and requests from CHMP, section 4.1 of the Pegasys SmPC therefore clarifies that 
the indication only concerns children with persistently elevated ALT levels (i.e. marker of immune 
activation).   
Further, response rates in genotype D-infected children, constituting around one third of study 
subjects, were very low (around 10%). To some extent, the figure is likely explained by other baseline 
factors, since further analyses indicated that normal or minimally increased ALT levels were more 
frequent in the genotype D-infected children in the present study.  In adult studies the difference in 
outcomes by genotype was less pronounced. Hence, a genotype specific indication is not considered 
necessary by the CHMP, but the data is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Of note, genotypes other 
than A-D have not been studied, neither in children nor adults, which is reflected in the SmPC. 
Moreover, another factor that may have affected the delayed HBeAg-seroconversion in paediatric 
responders in this study vs. adult responders was the mean baseline HBeAg level, which was higher in 
children than in adults. The difference in decline of HBeAg and HBV-DNA between responders and non-
responders opens for predictions of the likelihood of response early during treatment (for example at 
week 12). The MAH was asked to provide a similar analysis on the paediatric data. Despite the 
exploratory nature of the analyses and small n numbers, the response in patients with lower decline in 
HVB-DNA at week 12 seemed poorer compared to those patients who achieved a steeper decline in 
HBV-DNA. For transparency, this is reflected in section 5.1 of the Pegasys SmPC. 
The common side effects seemed to be similar in frequency in children compared to adults, although 
AE reporting from young children would likely be associated with some methodological problems. The 
frequency of severe AEs was reported to be low, and therapy was stopped due to an AE in only 1/111 
treated in this study. The majority of thyroid laboratory abnormalities, an event linked to interferon 
therapy, were isolated and single events of high FT3 not accompanied by TSH or FT4 abnormalities.  
None of these abnormalities was reported as an AE, except two high TSH abnormalities AEs which did 
not require treatment. Perhaps the main safety issue is the risk of reduced adult stature, where 
treatment of paediatric patients with interferons in this and prior trials yielded variable but overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/54377/2018 
Page 62/64 
 
 
substantial proportions of patients with marked reductions in height by age percentiles, which in many 
cases seem only partially reversible. 
There is presently no data to support that there is any relevant difference between interferons with 
regards the risk for height reductions. Differences in reductions at post treatment follow-up between 
studies would likely rather be a result of proportions of individuals most vulnerable (i.e. at growth 
spurt during puberty when treated). Of note, a greater risk of growth impairment especially during 
puberty cannot be ruled out and the current wording in section 4.4 of the Pegasys SmPC was updated 
accordingly. One additional amendment to Section 4.4 of the SmPC is inserted to clarify that growth 
inhibition is not only an issue with combination therapy but also Pegasys monotherapy. 
3.5.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit risk balance for the revised proposed indication is currently considered positive. Relevant 
sections of the SmPC (including section 4.1) were updated to certify a more adequate selection for 
whom to treat. In order to emphasize the need for the prescribers to consult section 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1 
for decision making, CHMP agreed that the following wording “with respect to the decision to initiate 
treatment in paediatric patients, see section 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1” is added to the Pegasys SmPC. A more 
conservative writing which minimizes the risk for the treatment of children, who barely have entered 
the immune active stage, is warranted, having response rates and safety issues in mind. Further, 
despite some limitations, the results of exploratory analyses conducted by the MAH can be considered 
supportive of therapy of all genotypes. 
3.5.3.  Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The views around which children with CHB should be treated vary between regions and countries. To 
treat children with weekly injections of PEG-IFN for 1 year, with associated side effects, and a fairly 
low probability of response may indeed be questioned in most cases, having the general disease 
course in mind. However, daily therapy with direct antivirals (conversion rate similar), per se well 
tolerated, may also be problematic in some cases, taking for example adherence into account, and less 
established knowledge when such therapy can be safely stopped. While treatment likely could be 
deferred during childhood and adolescents in many cases, there is still a group of paediatric patients 
where therapy would be indicated.  
3.6.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Pegasys for treatment of non-cirrhotic children and adolescents 3 
years of age and older with HBeAg-positive CHB, who show evidence of viral replication and 
persistently elevated serum ALT levels, as well as for all other approved indications, is positive.

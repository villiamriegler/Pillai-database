Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Edurant 
rilpivirine 
On 22 October 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Edurant. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag International N.V. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows2:  
“EDURANT, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, is indicated for the 
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral 
treatment-naïve adult patients 12 years of age and older with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA 
copies/ml. 
As with other antiretroviral medicinal products, genotypic resistance testing should guide the use of 
EDURANT (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

from adoption of the opinion

1.  Updated Assessment 
The current updated report concerns the assessment of the responses as submitted by the applicant. 
The  first  round’s  Rapporteur’s  AR  was  circulated  and  concluded  to  in  the  December  CHMP.  The 
assessment of the RSI can be found at the end of the current AR under section 6. 
2.  Introduction 
The  applicant  submitted  two  paediatric  studies  A1501080  and  A1501085  investigating  the  safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of voriconazole in paediatric patients from 2 to <18 years of age. The present 
paediatric data is submitted by the MAH in accordance with article 46 of Regulation EC No 1901/2006. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
About the product 
Voriconazole (Vfend®) is a broad-spectrum, triazole antifungal agent. Its mode of action is inhibition of 
fungal  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)-mediated  14α-sterol  demethylation,  an  essential  step  in  ergosterol 
biosynthesis.  Voriconazole  is  active  against  a  wide  range  of  yeasts  and  filamentous  fungi,  including 
Candida,  Aspergillus,  Fusarium,  and  Scedosporium  species.  The  efficacy  of  voriconazole  for  the 
treatment  of  both  invasive  aspergillosis  and  invasive  candidiasis  in  adult  patients  has  been 
demonstrated in prospective, randomised, controlled studies. Marketing approval has been granted in 
over  90  countries,  including  the  United  States,  European  Union  (EU),  and  Australia,  and  a  wealth  of 
experience with the product has been accumulated over the past 10 years.  
Approved indication(s) and posology 
Indication 
Voriconazole,  is  a  broad-spectrum,  triazole  antifungal  agent  and  is  indicated  in  adults  and  children 
aged 2 years and above as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment of invasive aspergillosis. 
Treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients. 
Treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei). 
Treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp. 
VFEND  should  be  administered  primarily  to  patients  with  progressive,  possibly  life-threatening 
infections. 
• 
Prophylaxis  of  invasive  fungal  infections  in  high  risk  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplant (HSCT) recipients. 
Posology 
Electrolyte  disturbances  such  as  hypokalaemia,  hypomagnesaemia  and  hypocalcaemia  should  be 
monitored and corrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 
4.4). 
VFEND  is  also  available  as  200  mg  film-coated  tablets,  200  mg  powder  for  solution  for  infusion,  200 
mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion and 40 mg/ml powder for oral suspension.

Treatment 
Adults 
Therapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of either intravenous or oral VFEND 
to achieve plasma concentrations on Day 1 that are close to steady state. On the basis of the high oral 
bioavailability  (96%;  see  section  5.2),  switching  between  intravenous  and  oral  administration  is 
appropriate when clinically indicated. 
Detailed information on dosage recommendations is provided in the following table: 
Treatment duration should be as short as possible depending on the patient’s clinical and mycological 
response.  Long  term  exposure  to  voriconazole  greater  than  180  days  (6  months)  requires  careful 
assessment of the benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Dosage adjustment (Adults) 
If  patient  response  to  treatment  is  inadequate,  the  maintenance  dose  may  be  increased  to  300  mg 
twice daily for oral administration. For patients less than 40 kg the oral dose may be increased to 150 
mg twice daily. If patient is unable to tolerate treatment at a higher dose, reduce the oral dose by 50 
mg steps to the 200 mg twice daily (or 100 mg twice daily for patients less than 40 kg) maintenance 
dose. 
In case of use as prophylaxis, refer below. 
Children (2 to <12 years) and young adolescents with low body weight (12 to 14 years and <50 kg) 
Voriconazole  should  be  dosed  as  children  as  these  young  adolescents  may  metabolize  voriconazole 
more similarly to children than to adults 
The recommended dosing regimen is as follows: 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/309129/2015  
Page 5/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It  is  recommended  to  initiate  the  therapy  with  intravenous  regimen,  and  oral  regimen  should  be 
considered  only  after  there  is  a  significant  clinical  improvement.  It  should  be  noted  that  an  8  mg/kg 
intravenous dose will provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral 
dose. 
These  oral  dose  recommendations  for  children  are  based  on  studies  in  which  voriconazole  was 
administered  as  the  powder  for  oral  suspension.  Bioequivalence  between  the  powder  for  oral 
suspension and tablets has not been investigated in a paediatric population. Considering the assumed 
limited  gastroenteric  transit  time  in  paediatric  patients,  the  absorption  of  tablets  may  be  different  in 
paediatric  compared  to  adult  patients.  It  is  therefore  recommended  to  use  the  oral  suspension 
formulation in children aged 2 to <12. 
All other adolescents (12 to 14 years and ≥50 kg; 15 to 17 years regardless of body weight) 
Voriconazole should be dosed as adults. 
Dosage adjustment (Children [2 to <12 years] and young adolescents with low body weight [12 to 14 
years and <50 kg]) 
If patient response to treatment is inadequate, the dose may be increased by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 
mg  steps  if  the  maximum  oral  dose  of  350  mg  was  used  initially).  If  patient  is  unable  to  tolerate 
treatment, reduce the dose by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 mg steps if the maximum oral dose of 350 mg 
was used initially). 
Use in paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years with hepatic or renal insufficiency has not been studied 
(see sections 4.8 and 5.2). 
Prophylaxis in Adults and Children 
Prophylaxis  should  be  as  short  as  possible  depending  on  the  risk  for  developing  invasive  fungal 
infection  (IFI)  as defined by  neutropenia  or immunosuppression.  It  may  only  be  continued  up to  180 
days  after  transplantation  in  case  of  continuing  immunosuppression  or  graft  versus  host  disease 
(GvHD) (see section 5.1). 
Dosage 
The recommended dosing regimen for prophylaxis is the same as for treatment in the respective age 
groups. Please refer to the treatment tables above. 
Duration of prophylaxis 
The safety and efficacy of voriconazole use for longer than 180 days has not been adequately studied 
in clinical trials. 
Use of voriconazole in prophylaxis for greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful assessment of 
the benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The following instructions apply to both Treatment and Prophylaxis 
Dosage adjustment 
For  prophylaxis  use,  dose  adjustments  are  not  recommended  in  the  case  of  lack  of  efficacy  or 
treatment-related adverse events. In the case of treatment-related adverse events, discontinuation of 
voriconazole  and  use  of  alternative  antifungal  agents  must  be  considered  (see  section  4.4  and  4.8) 
Dosage adjustments in case of co-administration Phenytoin may be coadministered with voriconazole if

the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased from 200 mg to 400 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg 
to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg), see sections 4.4 and 4.5. 
The  combination  of  voriconazole  with  rifabutin  should,  if  possible  be  avoided.  However,  if  the 
combination is strictly needed, the maintenance dose of voriconazole may be  increased from 200 mg 
to 350 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg), see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5. 
Efavirenz  may  be  coadministered  with  voriconazole  if  the  maintenance  dose  of  voriconazole  is 
increased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose is reduced by 50%, i.e. to 300 mg once 
daily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dosage of efavirenz should be restored 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Patients with renal impairment 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  orally  administered  voriconazole  are  not  affected  by  renal  impairment. 
Therefore,no adjustment is necessary for oral dosing for patients with mild to severe renal impairment 
(see section 5.2). 
Voriconazole  is  haemodialysed  with  a  clearance  of  121  ml/min.  A  4-hour  haemodialysis  session  does 
not remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be 
halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) receiving voriconazole 
(see section 5.2). 
Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe chronic hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C). 
There is limited data on the safety of VFEND in patients with abnormal liver function tests (aspartate 
transaminase  [AST],  alanine  transaminase  [ALT],  alkaline  phosphatase  [ALP],  or  total  bilirubin  >5 
times the upper limit of normal). 
Voriconazole  has  been  associated  with  elevations  in  liver  function  tests  and  clinical  signs  of  liver 
damage,such  as  jaundice,  and  must  only  be  used  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  if  the 
benefit  outweighs  the  potential  risk.  Patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  must  be  carefully 
monitored for drug toxicity (see section 4.8). 
Paediatric population 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  VFEND  in  children  below  2  years  has  not  been  established.  Currently 
available  data  are  described  in  sections  4.8  and  5.1  but  no  recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be 
made.

3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that studies A1501080 and A1501085 are stand alone studies. 
3.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
The  currently  approved  paediatric  dosing  regimens  were  based  on  a  population  pharmacokinetic 
modeling approach, and are predicted to provide voriconazole exposures comparable to those in adult 
patients receiving the approved dosing regimens. These 2 paediatric studies were conducted with these 
regimens to confirm whether these doses are appropriate for paediatric use.  
In  addition,  Study  A1501085  also  enrolled  10  paediatric  patients  with  EC.  A  lower  dosing  regimen 
was  evaluated,  which  matched  the  dosing  regimen  used  in  adult  patients  with  EC  (200  mg  oral  (PO) 
every 12 hours (q12h) without loading doses).  
The  initial  dosing  regimens  used  in  Studies  A1501080  and  A1501085  are  summarised  by  age  and 
indication in Table 1.  
At  the  investigator’s  discretion  a  patient  could  receive  dose  reduction  or  escalation  based on  through 
samples collected on the 3rd day (or later) of IV/oral therapy in line with the approved SmPC.

while it will provide exposure comparable to 3 mg/kg IV q12h.  
f For IA treatment, at the investigator's discretion, a dose of 300 mg PO q12h could be used in adolescents. 
CHMP comments:  
The dosages used with these paediatric studies are in line with the approved SmPC.  
Limited voriconazole concentration data were obtained from Studies A1501080 and A1501085. No new 
clinical  pharmacology  information  is  currently  available  from  Studies  A1501080  and  A1501085. 
However, analyses to explore the relationship between voriconazole exposure and efficacy and safety 
endpoints  in  the  paediatric  patients  in  these  studies  are  ongoing.  The  report  will  be  submitted  when 
available (Target completion date: end September 2014).  
The Rapporteur will await the submission of these data.

3.3.2.  Clinical studies 
Safety  was  considered  primary  end  point  in  both  open-label  studies.  The  observed  efficacy  of  both 
studies will be briefly presented by the Rapporteur as efficacy parameters were considered secondary 
endpoints. 
Data  from  Studies  A1501080  and  A1501085,  have  also  been  evaluated  taking  into  consideration  the 
events  of  interest  (i.e.  important  identified  and  potential  risks  included  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan 
(RMP  Version  2.0).  Refer  to  paragraph  “Important  Identified  and  Potential  Risks”  for  the  critical 
assessment in the paragraph on safety discussion. 
Results 
Efficacy 
Study A1501080 
This  was  a  prospective,  open  label,  non-comparative  descriptive  study  conducted  to  evaluate  the 
safety,  tolerability  and  efficacy  of  voriconazole  in  paediatric  patients  2  to  <18  years  of  age  with 
invasive  fungal  infection  (IFI)  due  to  Aspergillus,  Scedosporium  or  Fusarium  species.  Thirty-one 
patients were included. Demographics are presented in Table 2 (in the safety section). 
Patients  who  met  European  Organisation  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  (EORTC)  criteria  for 
proven  or  probable  IA  were  analysed  for  efficacy.  No  patients  with  infection  due  to  Scedosporium  or 
Fusarium species were enrolled.  
A  total  of  31  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  voriconazole  and  were  included  in  the  safety 
population  (11  patients  were  2  to  <12  years  old  and  20  were  12  to  <18  years  old).  Of  these,  14 
patients had proven or probable IA (5 patients were 2 to <12 years old and  9 were 12 to <18 years 
old), and were included in the modified intent to treat (MITT) population.  
The overall rate of global response1 was 64.3% (95% CI: 35.1, 87.2) at the 6-week timepoint, which 
is similar to that in adult therapeutic studies in IA (53%[1]). Success rates were numerically higher in 
the 12 to <18 year age-group than in the younger age group (77.8% (95% CI: 40.0, 97.2) and 40.0% 
(95% CI: 5.3, 85.3), respectively. The rates of successful global response and the number of patients 
with a successful response remained the same at the EOT timepoint. 
1 A successful global response was defined as either a complete (resolution of all clinical signs and symptoms PLUS 
resolution  of  90  percent  or  more  of  the  lesions  visible  on  radiological  studies  and  attributed  to  IA  at  Baseline)  or 
partial  response  (clinical  improvement  PLUS  50 percent  to  <90  percent  resolution  of  the  radiological  lesions 
attributed to IA at Baseline) response.

CHMP comments:  
Efficacy  was  considered  secondary.  Limited  number  of  paediatric  patients  (n=31)  were  enrolled.  Of 
these patients 14/31 had confirmed or probably IA. No patients with infection due to Scedosporium or 
Fusarium species were enrolled. Response rate at the 6-weeks timepoint was similar to the observed 
response  rate  adult  therapeutic  studies.  The  rates  of  successful  global  response  and  the  number  of 
patients with a successful response remained the same at the EOT timepoint. Due to the nature of the 
study and limited number of patients no definite conclusion can be drawn. 
Study A1501085 
This  was  an  open-label,  non-comparative,  descriptive  study  of  voriconazole  for  the  treatment  of 
paediatric patients 2 to <18 years of age with ICC and EC. In this study, voriconazole could be initiated 
either  as  primary  therapy  for  ICC  or  EC,  or  as  salvage  therapy  for  ICC  or  EC  with  an  unsatisfactory 
response to at least 7 days of treatment with at least 1 other antifungal agent.  
A  total  of  22  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  voriconazole  and  were  included  in  the  safety 
population (14 patients were 2 to <12 years old and 8 were 12 to <18 years old. A total of 17 patients 
were  included  in  the  MITT  population  (9  were  2  to  <12  years  old  and  8  were  12  to  <18  years  old. 
Demographics are presented in Table 4 (in the safety section) 
A  total  of  7  patients  entered  the  study  with  a  diagnosis  of  ICC  and  10  entered  the  study  with  a 
diagnosis of EC. A total of 5 patients entered the study with a diagnosis of primary ICC, and 8 had the 
diagnosis of primary EC. A total of 2 patients entered the study with a diagnosis of salvage ICC, and 2 
had the diagnosis of salvage EC. 
Most patients had baseline Candida albicans (12 patients; 2 had isolates from blood only and 10 from 
other sources2) and Candida tropicalis (3 patients who had isolates from blood only). Only 2 patients 
had baseline Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis (1 patient each, both with isolates from blood 
only. 
The overall rate of global response (ICC and EC combined) was 76.5% (95% CI: 50.10, 93.19) at EOT. 
The  rate  of  response  was  88.9%  (95% CI:  51.75,  99.72)  for  2  to  <12  year  olds  and  62.5%  (24.49, 
91.48)  for  12  to  <18  year  olds.  These  rates  are  comparable  with  data  in  therapeutic  studies  in  ICC 
(65%[2]) and EC (98%[3]). 
The global response for patients with EC included success in 7 (70.0%) patients, failure in 1 (10.0%) 
patient,  and  indeterminate  in  2  (20.0%)  patients.  The  global  response  for  patients  with  ICC  included 
success in 6 (85.7%) patients and indeterminate in 1 (14.3%) patient. 
The global response rate at EOT  was success for 4  (80.0%) patients with primary ICC therapy and 2 
(100.0%)  patients  with  salvage  ICC  therapy.  The  global  response  rate  at  EOT  was  success  for  6 
(75.0%) patients with primary EC therapy and 1 (50.0%) patients with salvage EC therapy. 
Two (2) patients with a diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis and global response of success at the EOT 
later  had  recurrence  of  esophageal  candidiasis  (14  and  16  days  after  the  last  dose  of  voriconazole, 
respectively).  One  (1)  patient  with  a  diagnosis  of  esophageal  candidiasis  and  a  global  response  of 
2 Other specimen type includes culture result from throat/oral mucosa, esophageal mucosa, and perianal site.

success  at  the  EOT  (in  relation  to  esophageal  candidiasis)  developed  suspected  splenic  candidiasis 
during therapy. 
CHMP comments: Efficacy was considered secondary endpoint. Limited number of paediatric patients 
(n=22)  were  included.  The  global  response  rates  at  EOT  were  comparable  with  data  in  therapeutic 
studies in ICC (65%[2]) and EC (98%[3]). The quoted references were submitted by the applicant and 
are publication of the initial studies. 
Due to the nature of the paediatric study and limited number of patients no definite conclusion can be 
drawn.  
In conclusion: Both studies A1501080 and A1501085 were open label with safety as primary endpoint. 
All Efficacy parameters were considered secondary endpoints. In addition the total number of include 
patients  n=22  and  n=23  respectively  are  limited.  Hence  no  firm  conclusion  on  the  efficacy  of 
voriconazole can be drawn.   
Safety results 
Study A1501080 
Patients in the safety population received IV voriconazole for a median of 8.0 days the median length 
of  IV  voriconazole  treatment  was  similar  in  the  2  age  groups  (8  days  and  8.5  days  in  the  2  to  <12 
years age-group and 12 to <18 years age/group, respectively). No patient received more than 33 days 
of IV treatment. The median length of oral voriconazole treatment was also similar in both age groups 
in the safety population (55 days and 59.5 days in the 2 to <12 years age-group and 12 to <18 years 
age-group, respectively).

Table 2: Demographic Characteristics of study A1501080 (Safety Population). 
All-causality  treatment-emergent  AEs  (Table  3)  were  reported  in  30  (96.8%)  of  the  31  patients 
(281 events). Similar results were observed across the age groups [11(100%) in age groups 2 to <12 
and 19 (95%) in age group 12 to <18]. 
A  total  of  15  (48.4%)  patients  had  an  SAE;  similar  rates  were  observed  across  the  age  groups  [6 
(54.6%) in age group 2 to <12 and 9 (45%) in age group 12 to <18].  
The  SOCs  including  the  majority  of  patients  that  experienced  all-causality  AEs  were  Gastrointestinal 
Disorders  (18 patients),  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue  Disorders  (16  patients),  Infections  and 
Infestations (16 patients), Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders (14 patients), and General 
Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions  (14  patients).  No  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were 
identified  when  compared  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  voriconazole  in  adults  in  the  therapeutic 
studies. In general, the safety data from the paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the 
known  safety  profile  of  voriconazole.  The  safety  profile  in  the  2  age  groups  was  also  similar.  Where 
differences in frequencies were observed, they were not assessed as clinically meaningful.

Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Causalities) Safety Population. 
All  SAEs  were  considered  as  unrelated  to  administration  of  voriconazole  by  the  investigators,  except 
the  event  of  renal  failure  acute  in  one  Patient  and  the  event  of  drug  induced  liver  injury  (DILI)  in 
another Patient. While the contributory role of voriconazole in developing these 2 SAEs is possible, one 
Patient  was confounded by concomitant use of vancomycin and ganciclovir and another Patient  was 
confounded  by  concomitant  use  of  paracetamol  and  concomitant  parainfluenza  virus  infection.  This 
patient  had  also  experienced  muscular  weakness  at  the  same  time,which  was  considered  by  in  the 
investigator as steroid induced myopathy. 
One (1) patient (3.2%) discontinued the study drug due to sepsis. A total of 4 (12.9%) patients either 
reduced the dose (3 patients) or temporarily discontinued voriconazole (1 patient) due to an AE; in 3 
patients  (,  all  in  older  age  group)  the  AEs  were  mild  or  moderate  treatment-related  liver  enzyme 
abnormalities and all resolved. In 1 patient the AEs were Thrombocytopenia, Gastrointestinal bleeding, 
and Acute renal insufficiency, all considered due to the patient’s acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  
Deaths 
Three (3) patients in the 2 to <12 year age-group and 2 patients in the 12 to <18 year age-group died 
during the study. None of the deaths were related to study treatment. 2 Patients in the 2 to <12 year 
age-group died from septic shock, and one Patient died of a ruptured mycotic aneurysm. In the 12 to 
<18  year  age-group,  one  Patient  died  of  septic  shock  and  another  Patient  died  of  acute  lymphocytic 
leukemia. 
Other findings 
No  new  safety  information  was  identified  upon  evaluation  of  laboratory  abnormalities,  vital  signs, 
electrocardiogram, and physical examination findings. 
CHMP comments:  
Thirty-one  paediatric  patients  were  included  in  this  study.  Median  IV  treatment  was  8  days  and  oral 
treatment was 55 days in the 2- <12 years group and 59.5 days in 12 - <18 years group.

A  total  of  15/31  patients  had  SAE.  Rates  were  similar  between  age-groups.  All  the  SAE  were 
considered unrelated to voriconazole by the investigators. Two patients experiencing acute renal failure 
and DILI respectively could be related to voriconazole treatment. However both patients also received 
concomitant medication (i.e. vancomycin, paracetomol, valganciclovir) which confounds the cases. 
Most  experienced  AEs  were  gastrointestinal  disorders;  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders; 
infections and infestations; respiratory, thoraric, and mediastinal disorders; and general disorders and 
administration site disorders. All hepatic-related adverse events occurred in patients in the 12 to <18 
age group and resolved. 
Three  patients  in  the  2  to  <12  year  age-group  and  2  patients  in  the  12  to  <18  year  age-group  died 
during the study. None of the deaths were related to study treatment. 
In  conclusion,  no  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  and  the  safety  data  from  the 
paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole. 
Study A1501085 
Of  the  22  patients  who  received  study  drug  and  are  included  in  the  safety  population,  9 received  IV 
voriconazole  only  and  13  received  both  IV  and  oral  voriconazole.  The  demographics  of  the  included 
paediatric patients are presented in Table 4. The median duration of treatment was 7 days (range 2 to 
24 days) for IV voriconazole and 9 days (range 2 to 37 days) for oral voriconazole. No patient received 
more  than  24  days  of  IV  treatment  or  37  days  of  oral  treatment.  The  median  duration  of  oral 
voriconazole treatment was higher in the 2 to <12 year age-group [15 days (range 3 to 37 days)] than 
the  12  to  <18  year  age-group  [5  days  (range  2  to  8  days)].  The  median  duration  of  IV  voriconazole 
treatment was similar in the 2 age groups [6.5 days (range 2 to 24) in the 2 to <12 year age-group 
and 8 (range 5 to 17) in the 12 to <18 year age-group].  
All-causality treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 19 (86.4%) of the 22 patients (113 events). No 
clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  frequency  of  AEs  were  observed  across  the  age  groups  [13 
(92.9%) in the 2 to <12 age group and 6 (75.0%) in the 12 to <18 age group].  
The  SOCs  including  majority  of  patients  that  experienced  all-causality  AEs  were  Eye  Disorders 
(9 patients)  and  Blood  and  Lymphatic  Disorders  and  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  and  Investigations 
(7 patients  each).  No  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  when  compared  to  the  known 
safety profile in the adult therapeutic studies. In general, the safety data from the paediatric patients 
in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole. The safety profile in the 2 
age groups was also similar. Where differences in frequencies were observed, they were not assessed 
as clinically meaningful.

Table 4: Demographic Characteristics study A1501085(Safety Population). 
Table 5: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Causalities) Safety Population. 
A total of 3 patients had an SAE; the occurrence of treatment emergent SAEs in both age groups was 
similar n=2 in the 12 to <18 age group and n=1 in the 2 to <12 age group). Only 1 patient a 12-year-
old White female, experienced treatment related SAE of Severe progression of splenic candidiasis.  
A total of 4 patients 2 in each age group discontinued the study drug due to an AE; in 3 patients the 
AEs were treatment related: Hyperbilirubinaemia (10191002), Mild liver disorders, and Progression of 
splenic candidiasis.

A  total  of  3  patients  all  in  the  2  to  <12  age  group  reduced  the  dose  due  to  an  AE  (all  treatment-
related);  in  2  patients  the  AEs  were  liver  enzyme  abnormalities;  both  resolved.  The  AE  involving 
patient  was  mentioned  above  and  discontinued  study  drug  after  which  liver  disorder  resolved.  No 
temporary discontinuation due to an AE was reported in this study.  
Deaths 
There  were  no  patient  deaths  during  the  study  period.  One  patient  died  after  the  safety  reporting 
period  (i.e.,  after  the  1-month  follow-up  visit).  The  patient,  a  3-year  old  Asian  male,  died  due  to 
progression of underlying disease (anaplastic medulloblastoma), 490 days after the first dose of study 
drug (455 days after the last dose of study drug).  
Other findings 
No  new  safety  information  was  identified  upon  evaluation  of  laboratory  abnormalities,  vital  signs, 
electrocardiogram, and physical examination findings.  
CHMP comments:  
Twenty-two paediatric patients were included in this study. Median IV treatment was 7 days and oral 
treatment  was  9  days.  No  patient  received  more  than  24  days  of  IV  treatment  or  37  days  of  oral 
treatment. 
A total of 3/22 patients had SAE. Rates were similar between age-groups. All the SAE were considered 
unrelated  to  voriconazole  by  the  investigators.  One  patient  experienced  treatment  related  SAE  of 
severe progression of splenic candidiasis. 
Most  experienced  AEs  were  eye  disorders;  blood  and  lymphatic  disorders;  and  gastrointestinal 
disorders. Two hepatic-related AE occurred in the 2 to <12 age group. 
No  deaths  occurred  during  the  study.  One  patient  died  after  the  safety  reporting  period  due  to 
anaplastic medulloblastoma. 
In  conclusion,  no  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  and  the  safety  data  from  the 
paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole. 
Important Identified and Potential Risks 
Data  from  Studies  A1501080  and  A1501085,  have  also  been  evaluated  taking  into  consideration  the 
events  of  interest  (i.e.  important  identified  and  potential  risks  included  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan 
(RMP Version 2.0): Phototoxicity, Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Hepatic toxicity, QTc prolongation, 
Visual Events, Peripheral neuropathy, Skin cancers (non-SCC) and Suicide related disorders), and were 
also  compared  to  data  from  adults  in  the  same  indication,  as  shown  in  Table  6.  All  combined 
therapeutic  paediatric  data  (N=105  from  Studies  150-303,  304,  305,  307,  309,  602,  603,  604,  608, 
A1501080  and  A1501085)  were  also  compared  to  adult  data  from  therapeutic  studies  (N=1603  from 
Studies 150-303, 304, 305, 307, 309, 602, 603, 604, and 608) as shown in Table 6.

No  AEs  related  to  phototoxicity,  SCC,  skin  cancer  (non-SCC),  or  suicide  related  disorders  were 
observed in either study. Similarly, no AEs related to these risks were observed when safety data from 
the paediatric population in all combined therapeutic studies was reviewed (N=105, Table 6). 
QT prolongation 
A  search  of  the  clinical  database  using  the  QT  prolongation  (Torsades  de  Pointes/QT  prolongation). 
Broad  and  narrow  SMQ  was  conducted  to  capture  all  potentially  relevant  events.  No  patients  were 
identified in Study A1501085. Two (2) patients (6.5%) were identified in Study A1501080 (1 patient - 
Loss  of  consciousness;  1  patient  -  Cardiac  arrest).  QT  prolongation  was  not  reported  in  these  2 
patients.  When  safety  data  from  the  paediatric  population  in  all  therapeutic  studies  were  combined 
(N=105), the frequency of patients experiencing AEs identified by the wide search criteria (4.8%) was 
similar to that observed in adults (4.5%) (Table 6).  
Visual events 
The  frequency  of  patients  experiencing  visual  events  in  Study  A1501085  (36.4%:  8/22)  was  slightly 
higher  than  that  in  adults  in  the  therapeutic  studies  (33.0%),  whereas  in  Study A1501080  the 
frequency of the patients with these events was lower (29%: 9/31). The type, severity and outcome of 
visual events reported in the 2 studies were similar to those observed in the adult therapeutic studies; 
the majority of the events were mild or moderate and resolved and none resulted in discontinuation of 
voriconazole.  Visual  safety  testing  results  did  not  show  new  safety  concerns.  No  clinically  meaningful 
differences  in  the  visual  related  AEs  between  the  studies  and  between  the  age  groups  in  each  study 
were  observed.  When  safety  data  from  the  paediatric  population  in  all  therapeutic  studies  were 
combined (N=105), the frequency of patients with visual events was slightly higher than that in adults, 
however not statistical significant (35.2% and 33.0% respectively; p=0.6689).  
Peripheral neuropathy 
The  frequency  of  patients  with  peripheral  neuropathy  related  events  in  Study  A1501085  (4.5%)  was 
lower than that observed in the adults from therapeutic studies (8.0%). However, in Study A1501080, 
a  numerically  higher  frequency  of  patients  with  peripheral  neuropathy  related  events  was  observed 
compared to the adults from therapeutic studies (12.9% and 8.0% respectively). All events in Studies 
A1501080  and  A1501085  were  unrelated  to  treatment  with  voriconazole  except  1.  The  nature  and 
severity of peripheral neuropathy related AEs in paediatrics from the 2 studies were consistent with the 
known  profile  for  voriconazole.  All  except  1  (Muscular  weakness)  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity. 
The  outcome  was  reported  as  resolved  for  all  events  except  1  (Moderate  paraesthesia  Study 
A1501080). ). No SAEs or events resulting in permanent discontinuation or dose reduction/interruption 
were  reported.  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  the  2  studies  and  between  age  groups 
within each study were observed. The peripheral neuropathy- related events were:  
•  Study A1501080- Paraesthesia, Skin burning sensation, Muscular weakness, and Arthalgia.  
•  Study A1501085- Paraesthesia. 
When safety data from the paediatric population in all therapeutic studies were combined (N=105), the 
frequency of patients with peripheral neuropathy related-events (7.6%) was similar to that observed in 
adults (8.0% [Table 6]).

Hepatic related events 
A numerically higher frequency of patients with hepatic- related adverse events was observed in both 
studies  (29%  in  Study  A1501080  and  36.4%  in  Study  A1501085)  compared  to  that  reported  in  the 
adult  therapeutic  studies  (24.0%).  However,  the  nature  and  severity  of  hepatic-related  AEs  in  the 
2 studies  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  voriconazole  as  observed  in  the  adult 
therapeutic  studies.  No  fatal  outcome  was  reported  with  any  of  the  hepatic  related  AEs.  No  cases  of 
liver failure were reported.  
In  Studies  A1501080  and  A1501085,  the  hepatic-related  AEs  were  primarily  liver  enzyme 
abnormalities  (mild/moderate) 3  except  in  2  patients  in  Study  A1501080  (1  patientreporting  severe 
Drug  induced  liver  injury  and  1  patientreporting  mild  Jaundice  cholestatic)  and  3  patients  in  Study 
A1501085  (1  patientreporting  severe  Liver  disorder,  1  patientwith  mild  Hepatosplenomegaly  and  gall 
bladder disorder, and 1 patientreporting Jaundice cholestatic) and moderate Hyperbilirubinaemia). The 
outcome  of  the  majority  of  AEs  (all  except  mild  Alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  increased  in  1 
patientand mild Jaundice cholestatic in 1 patient) was reported as resolved.  
In the 2 patients reporting severe DILI term Hy’s law and severe Liver disorder, a contributory role of 
voriconazole  is  possible,  however,  the  cases  were  confounded  by  concomitant  medications  and 
underlying diseases.  
In  Study  A1501080,  none  of  the  hepatic-related  AEs  resulted  in  permanent  discontinuation  from 
treatment.  In  3  patients,  the  dose  was  modified  or  interrupted  due  to  treatment-related  mild  or 
moderate liver enzyme abnormalities with resolved outcome.  
In  Study  A1501085,  voriconazole  was  permanently  discontinued  due  to  severe  Liver  disorder  in  1 
patientand  moderate  Hyperbilirubinaemia  in  1  patient,  both  resolved  after  drug  discontinuation.  Both 
AEs were reported as treatment related by the investigator but were confounded by concomitant use of 
chemotherapy  and  pancreatic  cancer,  respectively.  Dose  reductions  were  reported  in  3  patients  [1 
patient liver disorder with permanently discontinued voriconazole, 1 patient due to moderate Aspartate 
aminotransferase  (AST),  ALT  and  Gamma-glutamyl  transferase  (GGT)  increased  and  1  patient  due  to 
mild hepatic enzyme increased], all resolved. These AEs were reported as treatment related but were 
confounded  by  chemotherapy,  veno-occlusive  liver  disorder  (VOLD),  and  sepsis  at  baseline, 
respectively. No temporary dose discontinuations due to AEs were reported in this study. 
All hepatic-related adverse events in Study A1501080 occurred in patients in the 12 to <18 age group. 
Whereas in Study A1501085 all but 2 hepatic-related AE occurred in the 2 to  <12 age group. Similar 
observation  was  made  for  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities.  A  clinically  meaningful 
conclusion from this observation cannot be drawn due to limited sample size in each age group.  
When safety data from the paediatric population in all in therapeutic studies were combined (N=105), 
a similar observation of a higher frequency of patients with hepatic-related events, was observed in the 
paediatric  population  when  compared  to  adults  in  the  therapeutic  studies.  The  numerical  higher 
frequency  in  the  combined  paediatric  population  versus  adults  (28.6%  and  24.0%  respectively 
[Table 6]) was mainly associated to an increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities (AEs in 
the  Investigation  SOC)  in  paediatric  patients  compared  to  adults  (21.90%  and  16.09%  respectively). 
3 Per the broad search strategy used, 2 AEs (hypoalbuminaemia and prothrombin time prolonged) were reported in 
two patients but in these two patients the involvement of liver was not confirmed.

The applicant proposes to update Section 4.8 of the SmPC to include this information in the paediatric 
population subsection. 
The frequency of patients  who experienced AEs in the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC  was similar in the 
combined paediatric population (7.62% compared to adults (8.05%. In addition, the type and severity 
of hepatic-related AEs in the paediatric population are similar to adults.  
CHMP comments:  
The  applicant  evaluated  the  data  from  both  studies  (A1501080  and  A1501085)  taking  the  events  of 
interest  (phototoxicity,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (SCC),  hepatic  toxicity,  QTc  prolongation,  Visual 
Events,  Peripheral  neuropathy,  skin  cancers  (non-SCC)  and  suicide  related  disorders)  as  identified  in 
the RMP (V2.0) into account. Data was also compared to the adult data. 
No  AEs  related  to  phototoxicity,  SCC,  skin  cancer  (non-SCC),  or  suicide  related  disorders  were 
observed in either study. Similarly, no AEs related to these risks were observed when safety data from 
the paediatric population in all combined therapeutic studies was reviewed (N=105). 
The  observed  frequencies  of  QT  prolongation  and  peripheral  neuropathy  in  paediatric  patients  were 
similar  to  adults.  The  frequency  of  visual  events  observed  in  paediatric  patients  was  slightly  higher 
(non-significant) than the observed frequency in adults. 
All hepatic-related adverse events in Study A1501080 occurred in patients in the 12 to <18 age group. 
Whereas in Study A1501085 all but 2 hepatic-related AE occurred in the 2 to <12 age group. Similar 
observation  was  made  for  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities.  A  clinically  meaningful 
conclusion from this observation cannot be drawn due to limited sample size in each age group. When 
taking  into  account  all  safety  data  in  paediatric  patients  in  therapeutic  studies  (n=105)  a  similar 
observation  of  a  higher  frequency  of  patients  with  hepatic-related  events,  was  observed  in  the 
paediatric  population  when  compared  to  adults  in  the  therapeutic  studies.  The  numerical  higher 
frequency  in  the  combined  paediatric  population  versus  adults  (28.6%  and  24.0%  respectively)  was 
mainly  associated  to  an  increased  incidence  of  liver  function  test  abnormalities  (AEs  in  the 
Investigation SOC) in paediatric patients compared to adults (21.90% and 16.09% respectively).  
The applicant proposes to update Section 4.8 of the SmPC to include this information in the paediatric 
population  subsection.  This  is  agreed  upon  by  the  Rapporteur  a  type  II  variation  is  awaited.

3.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  applicant  submitted  two  paediatric  studies  (A1501080  and  A1501085).  Thirty-one  and  22 
paediatric  patients  were  included  respectively.  Both  studies  were  open-label  with  safety  as  primary 
endpoint.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  paediatric  study  and  limited  number  of  patients  no  definite 
conclusion on efficacy can be drawn. 
Treatment dosage and duration were in line with the approved SmPC of Vfend. The CHMP observed a 
probable discrepancy in the total number of paediatric patients stated in SmPC section 5.1 (n=54 aged 
2 -15 years) whereas the overview states that n=52 patients were included. Applicant is requested to 
substantiate the discrepancy. 
No  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  from  both  studies  and  the  safety  data  from  the 
paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole. 
Three patients died during study A1501080, their deaths were unrelated to the voriconazole treatment. 
After the safety reporting period of study A1501080 one patient expired due to underlying disease. 
Additionally the applicant evaluated the data from both studies (A1501080 and A1501085) taking the 
events  of  interest  (phototoxicity,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (SCC),  hepatic  toxicity,  QTc  prolongation, 
Visual  Events,  Peripheral  neuropathy,  skin  cancers  (non  SCC)  and  suicide  related  disorders)  as 
identified in the RMP (V2.0) into account. Data was also compared to the adult data. No AEs related to 
phototoxicity, SCC, skin cancer (non-SCC), or suicide related disorders were observed in either study. 
Similarly, no AEs related to these risks were observed when safety data from the paediatric population 
in  all  combined  therapeutic  studies  was  reviewed  (N=105).  The  observed  frequencies  of  QT 
prolongation and peripheral neuropathy in paediatric patients were similar to adults. The frequency of 
visual  events  observed  in  paediatric  patients  was  slightly  higher  (non-significant)    than  the  observed 
frequency in adults. 
All hepatic-related adverse events in Study A1501080 occurred in patients in the 12 to <18 age group. 
Whereas in Study A1501085 all but 2 hepatic-related AE occurred in the 2 to <12 age group. Similar 
observation  was  made  for  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities.  A  clinically  meaningful 
conclusion from this observation cannot be drawn due to limited sample size in each age group. When 
taking  into  account  all  safety  data  in  paediatric  patients  in  therapeutic  studies  (n=105)  a  similar 
observation  of  a  higher  frequency  of  patients  with  hepatic-related  events,  was  observed  in  the 
paediatric  population  when  compared  to  adults  in  the  therapeutic  studies.  The  numerical  higher 
frequency  in  the  combined  paediatric  population  versus  adults  (28.6%  and  24.0%  respectively)  was 
mainly  associated  to  an  increased  incidence  of  liver  function  test  abnormalities  (AEs  in  the 
Investigation SOC) in paediatric patients compared to adults (21.90% and 16.09% respectively).  The 
applicant  proposes  to  update  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  to  include  this  information  in  the  paediatric 
population subsection. This is agreed upon by the CHMP a type II variation is awaited.

4.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The  applicant  submitted  two  paediatric  studies  (A1501080  and  A1501085).  Thirty-one  and  22 
paediatric  patients  were  included  respectively.  Both  studies  were  open-label  with  safety  as  primary 
endpoint. Although the applicant presented some efficacy data no firm  conclusions can be drawn due 
to  the  nature  of  the  studies  and  the  limited  number  of  included  patients.  Treatment  dosage  and 
duration were in line with the approved SmPC of Vfend. The CHMP observed a probable discrepancy in 
the total number of paediatric patients stated in SmPC section 5.1 (n=54 aged 2 -15 years) whereas 
the  overview  states  that  n=52  patients  were  included.  Applicant  is  requested  to  substantiate  the 
discrepancy. 
No  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  from  both  studies  and  the  safety  data  from  the 
paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole. 
The  numerical  higher  frequency  in  the  combined  paediatric  population  versus  adults  was  mainly 
associated to an increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities (AEs in the Investigation SOC) 
in paediatric patients compared to adults. The applicant proposes to update Section 4.8 of the SmPC to 
include  this  information  in  the  paediatric  population  subsection.  This  is  agreed  upon  by  the  CHMP  a 
type II variation is awaited.   
The benefit/risk balance of Vfend remains positive in the approved indications. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
Type II variation to be requested from the MAH to amend the product information as follows: 
1.  The applicant is requested to submit a type II variation to update SmPC section 4.8 to include 
the observed increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities in paediatric patients.  
2.  Limited voriconazole concentration data were obtained from Studies A1501080 and A1501085. 
No  new  clinical  pharmacology  information  is  currently  available  from  Studies  A1501080  and 
A1501085.  However,  analyses  to  explore  the  relationship  between  voriconazole  exposure  and 
efficacy and safety endpoints in the paediatric patients in these studies are ongoing. The report 
will  be  submitted  when  available  (Target  completion  date:  end  September  2014).  The 
Rapporteur will await the submission of these data. 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarification requested as part of this 
procedure. (see section 4 “Additional clarifications requested”). 
5.  Additional clarifications requested 
3.  The  applicant  is  requested  to  discuss  the  observed  discrepancy  regarding  the  numbers  in 
paediatric  patients  treated  in  the  therapeutic  studies  being  n=52  as  stated  in  the  overview.

6.  Updated Assessment 
Assessment of the responses to the CHMP List of Questions - 
Clinical aspects 
Question 1 
The  MAH  is  requested  to  submit  within  2  months  a  type  II  variation  to  update  SmPC  section  4.8  to 
include the observed increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities in paediatric patients. 
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
The MAH confirms that a  Type II variation to update Section 4.8 of the  SmPC  will be submitted. The 
MAH proposes also to include an update to Section 5.1 to reflect the new paediatric patient numbers in 
the same variation. 
CHMP’s assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
The applicant commits to submit a type II variation within 2 months. 
Conclusion 
Point is solved. 
Question 2 
Limited voriconazole concentration data were obtained from Studies A1501080 and A1501085. No new 
clinical  pharmacology  information  is  currently  available  from  Studies  A1501080  and  A1501085. 
However, analyses to explore the relationship between voriconazole exposure and efficacy and safety 
endpoints in the paediatric patients in these studies are on-going.  The report will be submitted when 
available  (Target  completion  date:  end  September  2014).  The  CHMP  awaits  the  submission  of  these 
data. 
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
The  MAH  clarifies  that  the  PK-PD  report  (PMAR-EQDD-A150f-DP4-245:  Voriconazole,  Pediatric 
Population  PK-PD  Analysis  Report)  was  completed  in  September  2014  and  is  provided  with  this 
response. 
The  currently  approved  paediatric  dosing  regimens  were  based  on  a  population  pharmacokinetic 
modeling  approach.    These  dosing  regimens  are  predicted  to  provide  voriconazole  exposures 
comparable  to  those  in  adult  patients.    These  2  paediatric  studies  were  conducted  with  the  same 
regimens  and  confirm  these  doses  are  appropriate  for  paediatric  use.    No  update  to  the  SmPC  is 
proposed as a result of this analysis. 
The objectives of the population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analyses were: 
• 
• 
• 
To  describe  the  PK  of  voriconazole  in  the  target  pediatric  patient  population  based  on  limited 
sparse PK samples, if data permit 
To  predict  individual  exposure  parameters  (eg,  area  under  the  curve  over  12-hour  dosing 
interval  [AUC0-12]  and  trough  concentration  [Cmin])  based  on  the  final  PK  parameter 
estimates, if data permit 
To  explore  the  relationship  between  voriconazole  exposure  parameters  (AUC0-12  and  Cmin) 
and key efficacy endpoints (survival and global response), if data permit

• 
• 
• 
• 
To  explore  the  relationship  between  voriconazole  exposure  parameters  (AUC0-12  and  Cmin) 
and  key  safety  endpoints  (hepatic,  visual,  psychiatric,  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  AEs),  if 
data permit 
To identify and characterize patient factors which influence the variability in the PK and PD of 
voriconazole (eg, CYP2C19 genotyping status), if data permit 
To evaluate the model performance of voriconazole PK and PD models, if data permit  
To  explore  the  relationship  between  voriconazole  PK/PD  index  [eg,  AUC0-12/minimum 
inhibitory concentration (MIC)] and efficacy endpoints in a subset of patients, if data permit 
Data  from  two  studies  were  included  in  the  analysis,  i.e.  study  A1501080  and  study  A1501085  (see 
table below). 
In both studies, to facilitate potential dose adjustment, voriconazole trough samples were collected on 
the 3rd day (or later) of IV or oral therapy or after each dose adjustment. To enable rapid turnaround 
analysis,  the  voriconazole  samples  were  shipped  to  designated  non-GLP  (Good  Laboratory  Practice) 
reference  laboratories  for  assay  or  analyzed  locally.  In  Study  A1501080,  the  key  efficacy  endpoints 
included  all-cause  mortality  at  6  weeks  and  EOT  and  global  response  at  6  weeks  and  EOT.  In  Study 
A1501085,  the  key  efficacy  endpoints  included  global  response  at  EOT  and  all-cause  mortality  at  4 
weeks  (Day  28).  Four  types  of  AEs  (including  hepatic,  visual,  psychiatric  AEs,  as  well  as  skin  and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders) were the focus of this analysis. Each type of AE from these two studies 
was pooled and analyzed separately. 
Previously,  a  two-compartment  PK  model  with  first-order  absorption  and  mixed  linear  and  time-
dependent  nonlinear  (Michaelis-Menten)  elimination  was  developed  based  on  voriconazole 
concentration  data  from  5  studies  (A1501007,  A1501037,  A1501081,  A1501088  and  A1501092), 
including  immunocompromised  children  and  adolescents  as  well  as  healthy  adults  (PMAR-00204).  All 
clearance terms [maximum elimination rate (Vmax) at 1 hour after the start of dosing (Vmax,1), linear 
clearance  (CL)  and  inter-compartmental  clearance  (Q)]  were  scaled  allometrically,  using  weight  to  a 
power  of  0.75;  and  all  volume  terms  (volume  of  distribution  for  the  central  and  peripheral 
compartments, V2 and V3) were scaled allometrically. Only one parameter, maximum fraction of Vmax 
inhibition  (Vmax,inh),  in  healthy  adults  was  impacted  by  the  CYP2C19  status,  where  HEMs  and  PMs 
were  predicted  to  have  full  inhibition  (Vmax,inh  =  100%,  Vmax  =  0)  of  the  nonlinear  pathway  at 
maintenance  dosing.  The  final  model  used  first-order  conditional  estimation  (FOCE)  method  on  log-
transformed  concentrations.  This  PK  model  was  subsequently  adopted  to  fit  the  voriconazole 
concentration data from a Phase 3 Study A8851009 (adult patients with IA comparing voriconazole and

anidulafungin  combination  therapy  with  voriconazole  monotherapy,  PMAR-00284)  and  a  Phase  2  PK 
Study A1501096 (immunocompromised Japanese pediatric subjects, PMAR-00320), respectively. 
For  PK/PD,  Voriconazole  doses  could  vary  with  time  within  a  patient  since  dose  adjustment  was 
allowed per protocol. Therefore, for PK-PD analysis, individual voriconazole exposures were estimated 
using  individual  PK  parameters  from  the  final  PK  model  and  the  actual  doses  administered  to  each 
patient.  For  the  efficacy  analysis,  average  AUC0-12  and  Cmin  over  the  treatment  period  were  used. 
The average AUC0-12 values were also used for the calculation of the PK/PD index (AUC/MIC) for the 
subset  of  patients  with  MIC  data  available.  For  the  safety  analysis,  when  patients  had  no  hepatic  or 
visual AEs reported, average AUC0-12 and Cmin over the treatment period were used. When patients 
experienced an AE, the AUC0-12 and Cmin from the onset day of this AE were used. When using the 
single-panel  analysis  approach,  for  patients  experiencing  multiple  AEs,  the  AUC0-12  and  Cmin 
associated with the first AE occurrence were  used.  All the efficacy and safety data were evaluated as 
binary  data.  For  efficacy  analysis,  only  graphical  examination  was  performed  given  the  small  sample 
size  and  high  success  rate.  Additionally,  AUC/MIC  was  explored  as  a  potential  predictor  for  efficacy. 
The  safety  data  were  evaluated  using  a  logistic  regression  model  in  NONMEM  with  the  second  order 
conditional  (Laplacian)  estimation  method.  Each  safety  endpoint  was  analyzed  separately  using 
voriconazole exposure parameters (AUC0-12 and  Cmin) as potential predictors. Other covariates (eg, 
CYP2C19 genotyping status, gender and race) were also examined in each analysis. 
This  previously  developed  PK  model  continued  to  be  adopted  to  fit  the  current  data  from  studies 
A1501080 and A1501085. 
The  final  PK  dataset  contained  96  voriconazole  concentrations  from  48  patients.  Six  concentration 
records  with  missing  collection  time,  levels  below  the  limit  of  quantitation,  or  inconsistent 
concentration values were excluded from the PK analysis. The demographics of the patients included in 
the PK analysis are presented in Table S2. 
There  were  30  mITT  patients  with  exposure  and  efficacy  data  pairs.  Among  them,  14  patients  were 
diagnosed with proven or probable IA, 6 patients with ICC and 10 patients with EC. The MIC data for 
Aspergillus (ranged from 0.125 to 0.5 μg/ml) are available in 5 IA patients only, and the MIC data for 
Candida (0.03 μg/ml are available in 14 patients. 
In  both  studies,  only  a  few  concentration  data  were  collected  from  the  absorption  phase  and  the 
concentration  data  were  quite  variable,  which  posed  a  challenge  in  the  model  fitting.  The  simplified 
model with first-order absorption and linear elimination was selected as the final PK model to describe 
the  pediatric  data.  Compared  to  the  previous  PK  model,  the  removal  of  the  nonlinear  clearance  from 
the PK model did not show any degradation of model performance. Based on the parameter estimates 
and the diagnostic plots, two runs (Run 6 and Run 13) showed better performance than other runs (ie, 
lower  OFV,  improved  diagnostic  plots,  improved  precision  of  parameter  estimates,  and  successful 
convergence). These two runs represent two different model structures. Run  6 is a two-compartment

model with first-order absorption and mixed linear and time-dependent nonlinear elimination, which is 
similar to the previous PK model. Run 13 is a simplified model with less parameters for the elimination 
phase:  a  two-compartment  model  with  first-order  absorption  and  linear  elimination  only.  These  two 
runs had similar results, and Run 13 had slightly better performance than Run 6. The simplified model 
(Run 13) was selected as the final PK model. No new covariates were identified in the current analysis. 
The comparison of the model parameter estimates is shown in the table below.  
It indicated that the current sparse data did not support the time-dependent nonlinear clearance in the 
model  fitting.  Given  the  limited  concentration  data,  the  interindividual  random  effect  could  be 
estimated  for  linear  clearance  only  with  acceptable  shrinkage.  It  is  acknowledged  that  this  final  PK 
model was still not ideal since voriconazole concentrations with high values were underestimated (see 
figures below).

Nonetheless,  this  model  appeared  to  be  able  to  reasonably  describe  the  voriconazole  trough 
concentrations although the absorption phase was not estimated well. Overall, based on the totality of 
the  model  performance  metrics,  this  simplified  model  was  deemed  acceptable  to  provide  individual 
voriconazole  exposure  estimates  (AUC0-12  and  Cmin),  which  would  allow  subsequent  exploratory 
exposure-response analysis.  
Based on individual PK parameters from the final PK model, voriconazole exposure parameters in these 
pediatric patients (N = 48) at recommended IV and oral dosing regimens for IA, ICC and EC infections 
were  estimated,  and  are  summarized  by  age  and  weight  group  in  Table  12,  Table  13  and  Table  14, 
respectively.  At  the  matching  doses,  the  voriconazole  exposures  in  children  and  young  adolescents 
with  low  body  weight  were  comparable  to  those  in  all  other  adolescents  (heavier  or  older)  given  the 
large inter-individual variability. For instance, the geometric mean AUC0-12 at 8 mg/kg IV q12h (or 4 
mg/kg IV q12h in heavier or older adolescents) were 49.63, 54.91, and 37.28 μg·h/mL, respectively, 
and there was a substantial overlap of AUC0-12 distributions across these 3 age-weight groups.

In  adult  patients  with  IA  from  Study  A8851009,  the  estimated  voriconazole  geometric  mean  (CV%) 
AUC0-12 and Cmin at 4 mg/kg IV q12h were 51.0 (43%) μg·h/ml and 3.10 (52%) μg/ml, respectively; 
those at 300 mg oral q12h were 32.9 (45%) μg·h/ml and 2.04 (54%) μg/ml, respectively; and those 
at  200  mg  oral  q12h  were  22.0  (46%)  μg·h/ml  and  1.37  (54%)  μg/ml,  respectively  (see  table  17). 
Similarly, there was a concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole in approximately 30% of these 
adult  IA  patients.  At  matching  IV  doses,  the  average  exposure  values  and  exposure  distributions  in 
pediatric patients were comparable to those in adult IA patients. At matching oral doses, the average 
oral exposures in pediatric patients were higher than those in adult IA patients; however, there was a 
substantial overlap of exposure distributions between these two groups. Considering that treatment is 
being  provided  for  potentially  life-threatening  infections,  it  is  preferred  to  start  with  a  relatively  high 
dose  and  reduce  to  lower  doses  if  needed  to  ensure  sufficient  exposure  coverage.  Therefore,  the 
proposed dosing regimens as the initial recommendation for pediatric patients are deemed acceptable. 
Although  CYP2C19  genotyping  status  was  not  identified  as  being  predictive  of  voriconazole  PK  in  this 
analysis,  a  slight  trend  was  observed  that  the  average  voriconazole  exposure  tended  to  be  higher  in 
HEM  group  (CYP2C19  heterozygous  extensive  metabolizers)  than  that  in  EM  group  (CYP2C19 
homozygous  extensive  metabolizers).  Nonetheless,  there  was  a  substantial  overlap  of  the  exposure 
distributions across these groups due to large inter-individual variability.

Although race was not identified as being predictive of voriconazole PK in this analysis, a slight trend 
was  observed  that  the  average  voriconazole  exposure  tended  to  be  higher  in  Asian  patients  than  in 
non-Asian  patients.  There  was  a  substantial  overlap  of  the  exposure  distributions  between  Asian  and 
non-Asian groups due to large inter-individual variability. 
Population PK-PD analysis: 
Efficacy 
Since  there  were  very  few  failure  cases,  only  graphic  examination  was  performed.  For  the  failure, 
indeterminate or missing cases, the corresponding voriconazole exposures were above or close to the 
average values in patients who had success except for one EC patient. It indicated that failure was not 
due  to  low  exposure  to  voriconazole.  This  EC  patient  with  global  response  failure  had  the  lowest 
average voriconazole AUC0-12 and his corresponding Cmin was also in the lower end (although not the 
lowest),  who  was  neutropenic  at  baseline.  In  the  10  EC  patients,  there  were  7  global  success,  one 
failure and 2 indeterminate at EOT. Given only one failure case, no definitive conclusions can be drawn 
for  the  correlation  between  voriconazole  exposure  and  global  response  in  EC  patients.  All  the  6  ICC 
patients had global success at EOT. In the 14 IA patients, 11 patients were alive, 2 were expired and 
one was lost to follow up at EOT. The 3 IA patients who were expired or lost to follow up had relatively 
high  concentrations.  Additionally,  in  the  14  IA  patients,  there  were  9 global  success,  one  failure,  one 
indeterminate  and  3  missing  at  EOT.  This  failure  case  had  relatively  high  concentration.  In  addition, 
due  to  limited  MIC  data  and  failure  cases,  the  correlation  between  the  PK-PD  index  and  the  efficacy 
data  could  not  be  assessed  adequately.  The  success  rate  was  high  for  all  indications,  suggesting  the 
dosing  regimens  evaluated  in  studies  A1501080  and  A1501085  are  appropriate  for  pediatric  use 
although the sample size was limited. 
Safety 
Among  all  the  safety  endpoints  evaluated,  a  positive  association  with  voriconazole  exposure  was 
established for hepatic AEs only. It should be noted that this positive association was shown only when 
the  multiple-panel  data  were  analyzed.  When  the  single-panel  data  were  analyzed,  this  positive 
association diminished. It is noted that multiple-panel data analysis approach may have a slight over-
estimation  on  AE  probability  prediction  since  a  patient  with  multiple  AEs  would  be  counted  multiple 
times,  which  may  introduce  bias.  Furthermore,  for  the  all-cause  hepatic  AEs,  the  positive  association 
was  only  related  with  voriconazole  AUC0-12  (voriconazole  Cmin  marginally  missed  the  inclusion 
criterion). Thus, the observed positive association between voriconazole exposure and the occurrence 
of  a  hepatic  AE  is  weak  which  is  further  evidenced  by  the  wide  95%  CI  around  the  population 
prediction of probability of hepatic AE occurrence (Figure 18 and Figure 19).

With  the  limited  sample  size,  it  is  difficult  to  establish  definitive  exposure-response  relationships  for 
voriconazole  in  this  analysis  given  the  complex  clinical  situation  for  subjects  with  serious  fungal 
infections.  Thus,  management  of  voriconazole  treatment  (eg,  dose  adjustment)  remains  at  the 
discretion  of  the  physician  taking  into  consideration  the  individual  patient’s  clinical  response, 
tolerability profile and voriconazole concentration (if available). 
CHMP’s assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
As  indicated,  limited  data  are  available  from  studies  A1501080  and  A1501085.  This  hampered  the 
development  of  a  robust  model.  Despite  the  limitations  of  the  model,  with  some  underestimation  of 
high  plasma  concentrations,  the  data  indicate  that  at  matching  doses,  voriconazole  exposures  in 
children  and  young  adolescents  with  low  body  weight  were  comparable  to  those  in  all  other 
adolescents  (heavier  or  older).  With  regard  to  adults,  there  is  an  indication  of  higher  exposure  in 
paediatrics, however, a large variability is observed, the data are limited and there is a large overlap in 
values.

As  already  concluded  based  upon  the  provided  results  of  both  studies,  no  new  adverse  events  of 
concern were identified from both studies and the safety data from the paediatric patients in this study 
are consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole.  
With regard to efficacy, both studies A1501080 and A1501085 were open label with safety as primary 
endpoint. All efficacy parameters were considered secondary endpoints. In addition the total number of 
included patients is limited. Hence no firm conclusion on the efficacy of voriconazole can be drawn. 
Taken  together,  the  data  is  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  in  the  paediatric  population  and  no 
firm conclusion on efficacy can be drawn.  
Conclusion 
Point resolved. 
Question 3 
The  MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  the  observed  discrepancy  regarding  the  numbers  in  paediatric 
patients treated in  the  therapeutic  studies  being  n=52  as  stated  in  the overview.  Whereas  the  SmPC 
section 5.1 mentions n=61 paediatric patients of whom n=54 were aged 2 -15 years being treated in 
therapeutic studies. 
CHMP’s assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
The MAH clarifies that the 52 paediatric subjects quoted in the Clinical Overview from the recent Article 
46  submission  represent  those  subjects  enrolled  in  the  original  therapeutic  studies    who  were  <18 
years old.  Section 5.1 of the current SmPC includes information that was approved at the time of the 
original  MAA  submission  in  2000,  and  refers  to  a  different  subset  of  paediatric  subjects.    The  MAH 
clarifies that the 54 subjects quoted in the current SmPC were from compassionate use studies as well 
as the therapeutic studies.  This together with the different age range presented in the current SmPC, 
explains the apparent discrepancy in numbers. 
A Type II variation will be submitted to update Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC with regards to the 
safety  and  clinical  information  on  paediatric  patients  based  on  the  analysis  of  all  paediatric  data 
following completion of the 2 paediatric therapeutic studies (A1501080 and A1501085).   
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
The MAH’s substantiation is clear and seems to be enough for the assessment of the awaited update of 
section 5.1. 
Conclusion 
Point is solved. 
7.  OVERALL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS ON THE 
APPLICANT’S RESPONSES 
The applicant submitted two paediatric studies (A1501080 and A1501085). Thirty-one and twenty-two 
paediatric  patients  were  included  respectively.  Both  studies  were  open-label  with  safety  as  primary 
endpoint. Although the applicant presented some efficacy data no firm  conclusions can be drawn due

to  the  nature  of  the  studies  and  the  limited  number  of  included  patients.  Treatment  dosage  and 
duration were in line with the approved SmPC of Vfend.  
With regard to the developed population pharmacokinetic model, only limited data were available from 
studies  A1501080  and  A1501085.  This  hampered  the  development  of  a  robust  model.  Although  the 
limitations of the model, with some underestimation of  high plasma  concentrations, the data indicate 
that  at  the  matching  doses,  the  voriconazole  exposures  in  children  and  young  adolescents  with  low 
body weight were comparable to those in all other adolescents (heavier or older) given the large inter-
individual  variability.  With  regard  to  adults,  there  is  an  indication  of  higher  exposure  in  paediatrics, 
however, a large variability is observed, the data are limited and there is a large overlap in values. 
No  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  from  both  studies  and  the  safety  data  from  the 
paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole. 
Three patients died during study A1501080, their deaths were unrelated to the voriconazole treatment. 
After the safety reporting period of study A1501080 one patient expired due to underlying disease. 
Additionally the applicant evaluated the data from both studies (A1501080 and A1501085) taking the 
events  of  interest  (phototoxicity,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (SCC),  hepatic  toxicity,  QTc  prolongation, 
Visual  Events,  Peripheral  neuropathy,  skin  cancers  (non  SCC)  and  suicide  related  disorders)  as 
identified in the RMP (V2.0) into account. Data was also compared to the adult data. No AEs related to 
phototoxicity, SCC, skin cancer (non-SCC), or suicide related disorders were observed in either study. 
Similarly, no AEs related to these risks were observed when safety data from the paediatric population 
in  all  combined  therapeutic  studies  was  reviewed  (N=105).  The  observed  frequencies  of  QT 
prolongation and peripheral neuropathy in paediatric patients were similar to adults. The frequency of 
visual  events  observed  in  paediatric  patients  was  slightly  higher  (non-significant)    than  the  observed 
frequency in adults. 
All hepatic-related adverse events in Study A1501080 occurred in patients in the 12 to <18 age group. 
Whereas in Study A1501085 all but 2 hepatic-related AE occurred in the 2 to <12 age group. Similar 
observation  was  made  for  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities.  A  clinically  meaningful 
conclusion from this observation cannot be drawn due to limited sample size in each age group. When 
taking  into  account  all  safety  data  in  paediatric  patients  in  therapeutic  studies  (n=105)  a  similar 
observation  of  a  higher  frequency  of  patients  with  hepatic-related  events,  was  observed  in  the 
paediatric  population  when  compared  to  adults  in  the  therapeutic  studies.  The  numerical  higher 
frequency  in  the  combined  paediatric  population  versus  adults  (28.6%  and  24.0%  respectively)  was 
mainly  associated  to  an  increased  incidence  of  liver  function  test  abnormalities  (AEs  in  the 
Investigation SOC) in paediatric patients compared to adults (21.90% and 16.09% respectively).   
The applicant proposes to update Section 4.8 and section 5.1 of the SmPC to include this information 
in  the  paediatric  population  subsection.  This  is  agreed  upon  by  the  CHMP  and  a  type  II  variation  is 
awaited.   
The benefit/risk balance of Vfend remains positive in the approved indications.  
The MAH should submit within 2 months an update of Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to include the 
information related to P46 89.1.

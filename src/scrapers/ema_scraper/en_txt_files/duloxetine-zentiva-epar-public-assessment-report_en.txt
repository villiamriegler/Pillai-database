2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application for a marketing authorisation for Duloxetine Zentiva concerns a generic medicinal product of 
the centrally authorised product Cymbalta. 
Duloxetine (ATC code: N06AX21), a combined serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitor (SNRI). It weakly inhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, 
dopaminergic, cholinergic and adrenergic receptors. Duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular 
levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in various brain areas. It possesses central pain inhibitory actions, 
probably related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS. 
Cymbalta is approved for treatment of major depressive disorder, treatment of diabetic peripheral 
neuropathic pain and in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  gastro-resistant  hard  capsules  containing  duloxetine  hydrochloride 
equivalent to 30 mg and 60 mg of duloxetine as active substance.  
Other ingredients are:

Page 6/22 
 
  
  
Capsule  content:  sucrose,  maize  starch,  hypromellose,  talc,  hypromellose  acetate  succinate  and  triethyl 
citrate. 
Capsule cap: indigo carmine (E132), titanium dioxide (E171) and gelatin. 
Capsule body: titanium dioxide (E171), gelatin and yellow iron oxide (E172) (60 mg). 
The product is available in opaque PVC/PCTFE/Alu blisters 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The active substance is duloxetine hydrochloride, which is described in the Ph Eur.  
The chemical name of duloxetine hydrochloride is (3S)-N-Methyl-3-(naphthalen-1-yloxy)-3-(thiophen-2-
yl)propan-1-amine hydrochloride and has the following structure: 
The active substance is a white or almost white not hygroscopic powder, sparingly soluble in water, freely 
soluble in methanol, and practically insoluble in hexane.  
Duloxetine hydrochloride exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Enantiomeric 
purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC/specific optical rotation. In addition, no changes are seen during 
manufacture or storage of the finished product. Absence of routine testing of polymorphic form in the finished 
product is considered justified. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure for one of the manufacturers of the active substance.  
As there is a monograph of duloxetine in the European Pharmacopoeia, the second manufacturer  of the 
active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for 
duloxetine which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application for the second 
manufacturer if the active substance.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Two suppliers manufacture the active substance. 
An Active Substance Master File has been submitted by one of the manufacturers. The active substance is 
synthesized in 4 main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/373461/2015 
Page 7/22 
 
  
  
 
 
regards to their origin and characterised. Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance 
has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability for 
duloxetine hydrochloride supplied by the second manufacturer.  
Specification 
The finished product manufacturer applies the specifications set in the Ph Eur monograph for duloxetine 
hydrochloride. In addition, tests for microbiological purity (according to Ph Eur) and residual solvents are 
included.   
The active substance specification applied by the finished product manufacturer includes tests for 
appearance, identity (specific optical rotation, IR, identity of chlorides (Ph Eur), enantiomeric purity (Ph Eur), 
related substances (Ph Eur), heavy metals (Ph Eur), loss on drying (Ph Eur), sulphated ash (Ph Eur),assay 
(HPLC), microbiological purity (Ph Eur), and residual solvents (GC).   
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data (3 commercial scale batches per manufacturer) of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
For one manufacturer, stability data on two production scale batches of active substance stored in the 
intended commercial package for 6 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Results on stress conditions 
at elevated temperature (100°C for 24 hours), light (daylight and UV radiation for 24 hours), oxidizing 
(H2O2), alkaline (NaOH) and acidic (acetic acid or HCl) medium were also provide on 1 batch. 
The following parameters were tested:  appearance, specific optical rotation, related substances (HPLC), 
enantiomer purity, loss on drying, assay (HPLC) and microbiological quality. All the results at all storage 
conditions were acceptable in accordance to the specifications. No changes or trends of the results were 
observed.  
For the second manufacturer, three validations batches stored in the intended for commercial package for 60 
months at 25°C/60% RH and for 6 months at 40°C/75% RH. The following parameters were tested: 
appearance, identification (IR), P-XRD, loss on drying, related compounds (HPLC), enatiomeric purity (HPLC) 
and assay (HPLC). All the results in all batches at both accelerated and long-term storage conditions 
complied with the specification limits. There were no specific trends observed.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period with no special temperature storage conditions 
in sealed duplicate polyethylene bags placed into a PE drum.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The objective of the development was to prepare a formulation containing duloxetine hydrochloride which 
would be bioequivalent to the reference product. Cymbalta gastro–resistant hard capsules was the chosen 
reference medicinal product. 
Duloxetine is an active substance described in the Ph. Eur. The characteristics of the active substance were 
taken into account during the finished product development. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. Commonly used 
excipients in pharmaceutical area for the production of enteric coated pellets was chosen. A enteric coated 
layer containing a water suspension of hypromellose acetate succinate, talc and triethyl citrate is added on 
the pellets. Triethyl citrate is a plasticiser which prohibits cracking of enterosolvent layer of pellets. Quantities 
of these excipients were determined on the basis of results of acid-resistance and stability of the pellets.  
Sugar spheres are mainly used as inert cores in capsule and tablet formulations, particularly multi-particulate 
sustained–release formulations. Sugar spheres contain sucrose, Maize starch and may also contain starch 
hydrolysates and colour additives. Hypromellose acetate succinate is mainly used as component of controlled 
or sustained-release dosage forms, enteric coating agent, film-forming agent and solid dispersion vehicle. It 
is also used in the manufacture of capsules as an adhesive. Talc is used as lubricant and sucrose is used as 
capsule diluent. Opadry clear complete film coating system contains hypromellose and talc. No incompatibility 
between excipients has been observed and no incompatibility between excipients has been described in 
literature.  
For the formulation development, layering technology and enteric coating were taken into consideration. 
Layering technology was used for the pellets manufacture. Sugar spheres of different sizes were used as 
starting material upon which layers of active ingredient, separation and enteric polymer were applied. The 
functions of the separating layer are to provide a smooth base for the application of the enteric layer, to 
prolong the pellets resistance to acid conditions, to improve stability by inhibiting any interaction between the 
active substance and the enteric polymer in the enteric layer and improve stability by protecting the active 
substance from light exposure. For the protection of the active substance against decomposition in stomach, 
enteric polymer hypromellose acetate succinate (aqueous suspension of the dispersion of HPMC AS in water) 
was used as the base of enteric coating.  
 A single dose dissolution study in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid for 120 minutes followed by pH 6.8 phosphate 
buffer for 120 minutes (official/release media) and pH 4.5 acetate buffer for 120 minutes followed by pH 6.8 
Phosphate buffer for 120 minutes (to simulate fed condition) on the 60 mg strength was carried out on the 
reference product Duloxetin 60 mg gastro-resistant hard capsules, and slightly different formulations of the 
generic medicinal product (differences in quantity of enteric coating layer and separating layer and 
technology process of enteric coating layering). Based on the f2 results, one of the formulations was chosen 
for marketing. The choice of in-vitro dissolution method was described and acceptable discriminatory ability 
of the method was demonstrated. 
 A bioequivalence study was performed for the 60 mg strength showing bioequivalence between the 
reference product and the proposed commercial formulation. The formulation used during bioequivalence 
studies is the same that the used for marketing except the colorants used. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/373461/2015 
Page 9/22 
 
  
  
In order to support the biowaiver of the 30 mg strength and the similarity of dissolution profiles of the 30 mg 
strength and the 60 mg strength, comparative dissolution profiles of the two strengths were measured in two 
dissolution media. It was confirmed that the 30 mg capsules fulfil the general biowaiver conditions, presented 
in the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence. The comparison of dissolution profiles of the two 
strengths in pH 6.8 (after 2 hours in acidic media pH 1.2) and in pH 6.8 (after 2 hours in acetate buffer pH 
4.5) demonstrated that the biowaiver for the 30 mg strength can be granted.  
The development of the manufacturing process was based on the reference medicinal product parameters.  
Inert sugar spheres were selected to prepare pellets coated with the active substance. The selected pellet 
size met the relevant requirements in a manufacture process. Pellets of different size were tested during the 
development, but were not considered suitable. Sugar was added to the separating layer to increase the 
pellets resistance in acid conditions. For the processing of separation coating some additional excipients were 
studied. In relation to the enteric coating, the experimental process indicated that the crucial points are 
quantity of applied enteric coating, the coating integrity and uniformity of the coating application over the 
pellet surface. The type of enteric polymer and thickness of enteric layer was determined to be critical for 
similarity of dissolution rate with the reference medicinal product.  
The capsules are packed in blisters of opaque PVC/ PCTFE film-Aluminium foil. The PVC film complies with Ph 
Eur requirements and the EU regulations for materials intended for contact with food. Aluminium complies 
with the same EU Directive. 
Acceptable specifications and certificate of analysis for the PVC/ PCTFE film and aluminium foil has been 
provided. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: active coating, protective coating, enteric coating, 
encapsulation and packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The process has been validated for three production scale batches of each strength. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
uniformity dosage units (Content uniformity (HPLC)), identity of duloxetine (HPLC, UV), identity of chlorides 
(Ph Eur), identity (titanium dioxide, indigo carmine, Ph Eur), disintegration (HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC), , dissolution (HPLC) and microbiological purity (Ph Eur) .  
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing.

Stability of the product 
Stability data of 7 batches (production and pilot scale) of each strength of the finished product stored under 
long term conditions for up to 36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, for up 12 moths at 30 ºC / 60% RH and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of the medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, average mass of 1 capsule’s filling, identity of duloxetine (HPLC, UV), 
identity of chlorides (Ph Eur), identity (titan dioxide, indigo carmine and ferric oxide), disintegration (Ph Eur), 
content of duloxetine (HPLC), content uniformity (HPLC), dissolution, microbiological purity (Ph Eur) and 
water (K.F). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Supportive stability studies on one batch of capsules and on two batches of pellets stored at 25 ºC / 60% RH 
for up 12 months in bulk was as well studied. The tests parameters studies were appearance, identity of 
duloxetine (HPLC, UV), identity of chlorides, related substances (HPLC), content of duloxetine in 1 g of pellets 
(HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), microbiological purity (Ph Eur) and water (K.F.).  
In addition, 1 batch of the lowest strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Test parameters were appearance (capsule and 
filling of capsule), average mass, related substance 3-isomer, other known impurities individually, unknown 
impurities individually and sum of impurities.  
All results comply with the proposed specifications and no significant change in product quality was observed. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of two years with no special storage conditions as stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

N/A 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of  
Duloxetine Zentiva  is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes 
for all  duloxetine containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, 
the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
For a generic of a reference medicinal product no toxicological and pharmacological tests are required. The 
CHMP concluded that no additional non-clinical data were required.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for 2 different strengths (30mg and 60mg) of duloxetine gastro-resistant capsules. To 
support the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted 2 bioequivalence studies with cross-
over design, one under fasting conditions and one under fed conditions. These studies were pivotal for the 
assessment. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1 / Corr) as well as the guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  
Rev. 1 Corr 2), Note for guidance on modified release oral and transdermal dosage forms: section II 
(pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation) (CPMP/EWP/280/96 Corr) and Question number 3 of the Questions 
& Answers: Positions on specific questions addressed to the Pharmacokinetics Working Party 
(EMA/618604/2008) in their current versions, are of particular relevance.

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
According to the current GUIDELINE ON THE INVESTIGATION OF BIOEQUIVALENCE 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr), a bioequivalence study investigating only one strength for each 
pharmaceutical form may be acceptable if all of the following 5 conditions are fulfilled: 
 
 
 
 
the pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process; 
the drug pharmacokinetics is linear; 
the qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same; 
the ratio between the amount of each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is the same for 
all strengths (for immediate release products coating components, capsule shell, colour agents and 
flavours are not required to follow this rule); 
 
the dissolution profiles are similar under identical conditions for the additional strengths and the 
strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study. 
The applied product as well as the reference product is multiple-unit dosage forms, containing gastro-
resistant pellets filled in capsules. For a multiple unit delayed-release formulation establishing bioequivalence 
at one strength only is sufficient provided that the formulations contain identical beads or pellets and that the 
dissolution profiles are similar.  
The BE-studies were carried out on Duloxetin 60 mg gastro-resistant hard capsules.  Studying the highest 
strength is adequate considering that the pharmacokinetics is linear (or possibly slightly non-linear with a 
more-than-proportional increase in plasma concentration with increasing doses). The dissolution properties 
have been compared with the reference product and found acceptable. From a pharmacokinetic perspective, 
a biowaiver for the lower 30 mg strength is thus acceptable.  Requirements of biowaiver for the lower 
strength (30 mg) have thus been fulfilled.  
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted two pivotal single-dose bioequivalence studies, using 
the 60 mg strength, one under fasting conditions and one under fed conditions: 
Study DLN-P1-592 (fasted state) 
Study DLN-P1-593 (fed state) 
In addition, the applicant has submitted the synopsis of a pilot study in which 4 different test formulations 
were compared in the fed state. Conventional bioequivalence criteria were fulfilled for two of the formulations 
(test-1 and test-2). Based on the results from the pilot study, test-1 was selected as the to-be-marketed 
formulation and was used in the pivotal studies.

The application concerns a delayed-release formulation for which single-dose bioequivalence studies under 
fasting and fed conditions are adequate. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative 
enzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation. The pharmacokinetics of 
duloxetine demonstrate large inter-subject variability (generally 50–60%), partly due to gender, age, 
smoking status and CYP2D6 metaboliser status. 
Absorption: Duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post dose. The 
absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%). Food delays the time to 
reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption 
(approximately 11%). These changes do not have any clinical significance and therefore there are no 
restrictions with respect to food in the SmPC of the originator. 
Distribution: Duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation: Duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in 
urine. Both cytochromes P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major inactive metabolites. 
Elimination: The elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours).  
Linearity: According to the EPAR of Cymbalta there is an apparent slight non-linear behaviour and more-
than-proportional increase in plasma concentration across the duloxetine dosage range of 40 mg/day to 120 
mg/day. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the deviation from strictly linear pharmacokinetic behaviour is small. 
In a study by Zhao and colleagues, linear pharmacokinetics was observed within the range 30-90 mg (Zhao 
et al., 2009). 
Study DLN-P1-592 and Study DLN-P1-593 
Methods 
Study design  
Both studies were single-dose, two-way crossover studies conducted in 34 healthy volunteers at Algorithme 
Pharma Inc., Mount-Royal, Quebec, Canada in 2011. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and up to 48 
hours post-dose and the study periods were separated by a wash-out period of 7 days. The meal provided in 
the fed study was consistent with the guideline recommendations for a high-fat high-calorie meal that is 
recommended for a study in the fed state The study design is considered acceptable by the rapporteur. 
Test and reference products   
Test product: Duloxetine, 60 mg, gastro-resistant capsules, manufactured by Zentiva, k.s., Czech Republic, 
batch No. 49310311 AA, expiry date: 12/2011, assayed content 101.0 %. 
Reference product: Cymbalta, 60 mg, gastro-resistant capsules, by Eli Lilly from the Czech Republic market, 
batch No. A786483, expiry date: 03/2013, assayed content 101.3 %.  
The assayed content of the batch used as test product did not differ more than 5% from that of the batch 
used as reference product. 
Analytical methods   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/373461/2015 
Page 14/22 
 
  
  
 
Plasma concentrations of duloxetine were determined with an adequately validated LC/MS/MS method using 
duloxetine-D3 as internal standard. K2EDTA was used as anticoagulant. The calibration range was 0.500-
100.00 ng/ml. Long-term stability of analyte in matrix for a period covering the time from first sample 
collection until last sample analysis was demonstrated. The performance of the analytical method was 
satisfactory. The use of an achiral analytical method is acceptable since duloxetine is given as pure 
enantiomer. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods. The 
pharmacokinetic variables included Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-, tmax, t½ and extrapolated AUC. 
Statistical methods   
The statistical analysis was performed on log-transformed AUC0-t and Cmax using ANOVA. Bioequivalence was 
to be concluded if the 90% confidence intervals for the test/reference ratio of the population geometric 
means fell within 80.00-125.00% for AUC0-t and Cmax.

The extrapolated AUC was less than 20% in all subjects. Subject 27 had a period 2 (reference) pre-dose 
concentration of 0.569 ng/ml (result from repeated assay). Since the pre-dose concentration was less than 
5% of the Cmax value for this subject in period 2, the subject’s data was included in the pharmacokinetic and 
statistical analysis. This was in accordance with the protocol and in line with guideline recommendations and 
is acceptable. No subjects reached tmax at the first sampling point. 
For AUC0-t and Cmax the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and reference products fell within the 
conventional acceptance range of 80.00-125.00%. 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Duloxetine Zentiva 60 mg gastro-resistant capsules are 
considered bioequivalent with Cymbalta 60 mg gastro-resistant capsules.  
The results of study DLN-P1-592 and DLN-P1-593 with the 60 mg capsules can be extrapolated to the other 
30mg strength, according to conditions provided for in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In support of this application, results from two bioequivalence (BE) studies were provided, both using the 60 
mg strength formulation.   
No new efficacy or safety data has been submitted. The clinical overview, dated May 2014, consists of a 
review of published literature (58 references) on clinical, pharmacological and toxicological profile of 
duloxetine.  
Bioequivalence has been adequately demonstrated between test (60 mg strength) and reference product. 
Bioequivalence of the 30 mg strength has also been accepted since all conditions for biowaiver of additional 
strength according to the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP /1401/98 Rev. 1/ 
Corr) have been considered as fulfilled.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Bioequivalence has been adequately demonstrated between test and reference product.   
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Duloxetine Zentiva and justifications that  
Duloxetine Zentiva does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the 
reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant 
guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary.  
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative 
requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a qualified person 
responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction 
suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Duloxetine gastro-resistant capsules.  
The reference product Cymbalta is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder, treatment of 
diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. No nonclinical studies 
Assessment report

have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for 
the active substance was presented and considered sufficient.  
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The two bioequivalence studies formed the pivotal basis of the application. The study designs were 
considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and were in line with the respective 
European requirements.   
The test formulation of Duloxetine Zentiva 60mg gastro-resistant capsules met the protocol-defined criteria 
for bioequivalence when compared with Cymbalta 60mg capsules. Bioequivalence of the two formulations 
was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Duloxetine Zentiva in the treatment of major depressive disorder, treatment of 
diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

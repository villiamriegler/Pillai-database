1.  Introduction 
On 11 May 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric clinical study report for Exviera/Viekirax, 
in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study M14-748, An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the 
Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Efficacy of Ombitasvir (OBV), Paritaprevir (PTV), Ritonavir (RTV) With or 
Without Dasabuvir (DSV) and With or Without Ribavirin (RBV) in Pediatric Subjects With Genotype 1 or 
4 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection (ZIRCON), is a stand-alone study. 
CHMP comment 
The efficacy and on-treatment safety data from this study has already been assessed within 
procedures EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839. Therefore, this assessment report is limited to 
the new follow-up data submitted. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study M14-748, An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, 
Safety, and Efficacy of Ombitasvir (OBV), Paritaprevir (PTV), Ritonavir (RTV) With or 
Without Dasabuvir (DSV) and With or Without Ribavirin (RBV) in Pediatric Subjects With 
Genotype 1 or 4 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection (ZIRCON) 
2.2.2.  Clinical study 
Study M14-748 
Description 
Study M14-748 is a completed Phase 2/3, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety of ombitasvir (OBV)/ paritaprevir (PTV)/ ritonavir (RTV) 
with or without dasabuvir (DSV) and with or without ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
genotype (GT)1 or GT4-infected pediatric subjects of ≥ 3 to 17 years of age. 
Methods 
See EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839.

Results 
Recruitment, numbers analysed and baseline data 
See EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839. 
Efficacy results 
SVR24 results were consistent with the primary efficacy results with 98.4% agreement between SVR12 
and SVR24; the overall SVR24 rate in the ITT population was 96.9% with a 2-sided 95% CI of 89.3% 
to 99.1%. No subject failed to achieve SVR24 due to virologic reasons. 
CHMP comment 
The high correlation between SVR12 and SVR24 is in line with established knowledge within the field of 
HCV treatment with DAAs. 
Safety results 
For on-treatment safety, see EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839. 
Growth and Development Outcomes 
Height z-scores were calculated at PT visits using WHO published height-for-age z-score tables. No 
subject had a height z-score below -2, which would indicate evidence of stunted growth, at any visit. 
Mean change from baseline in height z-score across visits, sexes, and age groups ranged from -0.22 in 
the male, 12 to 17 year age group at PT Week 144 to 0.63 in the male, 9 to 11 year age group at PT 
Week 144. 
Height Z-score Change from Baseline (ITT Population)

Height Z-score Change from Baseline (ITT Population) (continued) 
Growth rate was calculated at PT visits as the change in height divided by the change in age from the 
previous visit. For females, mean growth rate at the Final PT Visit was 27.32 mm/year in the 12 to 17 
year age group, 35.14 mm/year in the 9 to 11 year age group, and 73.73 mm/year in the 3 to 8 year 
age group. For males, mean growth rate at the Final PT Visit was 7.17 mm/year in the 12 to 17 year 
age group, 89.20 mm/year in the 9 to 11 year age group, and 58.70 mm/year in the 3 to 8 year age 
group. 
Mean change in waist circumference at the Final PT Visit was -0.491 cm in the 12 to 17 year age 
group. 
Tanner pubertal stage subject listings have been provided but not summarized by the Applicant. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The new data assessed within this procedure does not alter the previous conclusion in procedures 
EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839. 
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
As concluded in procedures EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839, pharmacokinetic results from 
this study demonstrated that weight-based pediatric doses, administered orally as tablets, for the 
DAAs and RTV provided generally comparable exposures across the weight groups of 15 to 29 kg, 30 
to 44 kg, and ≥45 kg. Also, the efficacy and safety of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir with or 
without dasabuvir and with or without ribavirin in hepatitis C virus GT1 or GT4-infected pediatric 
subjects of ≥ 3 to 17 years of age appear comparable to that in adults. 
The new data assessed within this procedure does not alter the previous conclusion. Given that the 
Applicant does not intend to pursue a paediatric indication, no further data or clarifications are needed. 
The proposal to leave the SmPC unchanged is endorsed. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

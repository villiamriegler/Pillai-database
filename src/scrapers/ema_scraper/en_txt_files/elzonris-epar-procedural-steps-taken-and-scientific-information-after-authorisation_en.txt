safety information from the final report from study 
20255431 (CRL-263114) 'Characterization of fixed 
choroid plexus samples from primate study MPI-
2231-007 by Immunohistochemistry with DT, 
CD123, IL-3 and IgG' (MEA002) listed as a category 
3 study in the RMP. This is a non-interventional, 
post-authorisation study on blood brain barrier (BBB) 
models in order to determine a potential toxicity 
biomarker to further investigate the risk of choroid 
plexus lesions. The updated RMP version 2.2 has also 
been submitted. 
Choroid plexitis was identified during non-clinical studies 
(see section 5.3). While not observed in clinical studies, if 
clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of central nervous 
system (CNS) damage occur, full clinical and neuro-imaging 
examination, including fundoscopy and brain magnetic 
resonance imaging, is recommended. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

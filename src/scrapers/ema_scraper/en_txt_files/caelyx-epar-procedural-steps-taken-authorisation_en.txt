BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE 
1. 
Submission of the dossier 
The  company  Liposome  Technology  Inc.  submitted  an  application  to  all  EU  Member  States  for 
Caelyx through the Concertation Procedure (No. 89) on 21 December 1994. In application of Article 2 
of Directive 93/41/EEC, on 19 January 1995, the company Liposome Technology Inc. transferred to 
the  European  Agency  for  the  Evaluation  of  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA)  into  the  new  Centralised 
Procedure the application for a Marketing Authorisation for Caelyx, falling within the scope of Part B, 
indent 2 of the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) 2309/93. 
Medicinal products containing the active substance, doxorubicin hydrochloride, have already received 
in the EU an authorisation for marketing in various indications. The application was, therefore, made 
under Article 4.8.(a) (iii) of the EEC Directive 65/65.  
The Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP was: 
Rapporteur:  Dr. D. Jefferys 
Licensing status: 
Caelyx  has  received  (November  1995)  in  the  United  States  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for  the 
following  indication:  Treatment  of  AIDS-related  Kaposi’s  sarcoma  in  patients  with  disease  that  has 
progressed on prior combination chemotherapy or in patients who are intolerant to such therapy.

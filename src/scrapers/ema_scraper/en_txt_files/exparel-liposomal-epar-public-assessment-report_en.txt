2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Acute  and  chronic  pain  control  is  a  significant  clinical  challenge.  Pain  is  defined  by  the  International 
Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as ‘‘an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated 
with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage”. According to the Guideline 
on 
the  clinical  development  of  medicinal  products 
intended 
for 
the 
treatment  of  pain 
(EMA/CHMP/970057/2011) pain can be described as acute or chronic according to its duration. Acute 
pain is considered adaptive, in that it has a warning function. It is of short duration (generally up to a 
few weeks) and declines with the healing of the underlying injury or disease (e.g. post-surgical pain). 
Pain after surgery is a predictable part of the postoperative experience. Postoperative pain is considered 
a form of acute pain due to surgical trauma with an inflammatory reaction and initiation of an afferent 
neuronal  barrage.  However,  like  all  pain,  postoperative  pain  is  complex  and  multidimensional. 
Postoperative pain control is an essential component of the care of the surgical patient. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
A  study  of  56  World  Health  Organization  member  states  estimated  that  annually  234.2  million  major 
surgical operations take place worldwide (95% CI 187.2–281.2 million). This translates into about one 
surgery  each  year  for  every  25  people.  Surgery  induces  important  disturbances  in  body  homeostasis 
such  as  hypercatabolism,  hypercoagulability,  and  inflammation,  leading  to  a  series  of  symptoms  and 
signs  such  as  hypoxaemia,  pain,  nausea,  vomiting,  ileus,  sleep  disturbances,  and  fatigue,  and 
complications  including  pneumonia  and  myocardial  infarction.  Postoperative  pain  is  often  the 
predominant symptom. 
According to the applicant, approximately three in four patients who experience acute postoperative pain 
report it as moderate, severe, or extreme in intensity (Apfelbaum 2003; Gan 2014). More than 80% of 
patients who undergo surgical procedures experience acute postsurgical pain (PSP) and approximately 
75% of those with postoperative pain report the severity as moderate, severe, or extreme (Chou, 2016). 
The  incidence  of  severe  PSP,  with  significant  functional  deficit  is  estimated  at  5-10%,  and  effective 
approaches to prevent it are basically ignored (Sansone, 2015). During the postoperative period, pain 
manifests itself with maximum intensity during the first 24 hours, reducing progressively (Nava-Obregón, 
2016). Therefore, the onset of postoperative pain treatment requires a timely and efficient treatment, 
keeping in mind that it may extend to up to a week. 
Postoperative  pain  remains  an  important  problem  despite  notable  advances  in  the  scientific 
understanding of pain in recent decades. Poor management of postoperative acute pain may lead to the 
development  of  chronic  pain.  This  occurs  in  10%–50%  of  patients  after  various  common  operations. 
Once pain has become chronic, it is generally regarded as maladaptive and difficult to treat as patients’ 
response  to  currently  available  treatments  is  highly  variable.  Multiple  and  complex  mechanisms  are 
frequently  involved,  including  somatic,  psychological  and  socioeconomic  factors.  Associated  disorders 
such  as  depression,  anxiety  and  sleep  disturbances  may  have  an  additional  impact  (Guideline  on  the 
clinical 
development 
of  medicinal 
products 
intended 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
pain; 
EMA/CHMP/970057/2011).  Prevention  of  chronic  postsurgical  pain  involves  risk  factors  detection  and 
evaluation, appropriate anaesthetic support and effective postoperative pain management. In addition 
to  the  significant  personal  suffering  and  social  burden,  postoperative  pain  has  socio-economic 
consequences (prolonged hospitalisation, higher costs for care and treatment, re-surgeries, claims and 
compensations).

2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Pain  is  a  multifactorial  condition  involving  multiple  pathways.   Acute  pain  in  response  to  local  tissue 
injury, such as surgery, is mediated through two basic systems: local pain receptors in the skin or organs 
and a local inflammatory response.   
According to IASP website, acute pain after surgery has a distinct pathophysiology that reflects peripheral 
and central sensitisation as well as humoral factors contributing to pain at rest and during movement. 
Surgical  tissue  trauma  leads  to  nociceptor  activation  and  sensitisation.  As  a  result,  individuals  suffer 
ongoing pain at rest and increased responses to stimuli at the site of injury. Different surgical procedures 
involve distinct organs and specific tissue within and adjacent to them, creating a variety of patterns of 
nociceptor  sensitisation  and  differences  in  the  quality,  location,  and  intensity  of  postoperative  pain. 
Mediators  released  locally  and  systemically  during  and  after  surgery  that  contribute  to  nociceptor 
sensitisation include prostaglandins, interleukins, cytokines and neurotrophins. Decreased tissue pH and 
oxygen tension, and increased lactate concentration, persist at the surgical site for several days. These 
responses  may  contribute  to  peripheral  sensitisation  and  spontaneous  pain  behaviour  following  an 
incision. Nerves may be injured during surgery and hence discharge spontaneously. Spontaneous action 
potentials  in  damaged  nerves  may  account  for  qualitative  features  of  neuropathic  pain  that  may  be 
present early in the postoperative period and can evolve into chronic neuropathic pain. Noxious input 
during  and  after  surgery  can  enhance  the  responses  of  nociceptive  neurons  in  the  CNS  (central 
sensitisation) thereby amplifying pain intensity. The magnitude of central sensitisation depends on many 
factors, including the location of the operative site and the extent of the injury.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
During the postoperative period, pain manifests itself with maximum intensity during the first 24 hours, 
reducing  progressively  (Nava-Obregón,  2016).  According  to  the  literature  reference  provided 
(Apfelbaum, 2003), most intense pain is experienced on postoperative day 1, which decreases slightly 
by postoperative day 3. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Increasing evidence supports the use of multimodal analgesia to manage acute postsurgical pain (IASP, 
2017; Garimella and Cellini, 2013). Systemic analgesics as components of multimodal analgesia used to 
treat postsurgical pain include (IASP, 2017): paracetamol, non-selective and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-
2),  selective  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs),  alpha-2-delta  modulators  (gabapentin, 
pregabalin),  N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA)-receptor  antagonists  (ketamine),  alpha-2  adrenergic 
agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine), systemic local anaesthetics, corticosteroids. 
According to the applicant, local anaesthetics are particularly useful for management of moderate-to-
severe acute pain and have been shown to improve postsurgical analgesia and reduce opioid utilisation 
(Allen 1998; Szczukowski 2004; Duarte 2006; Seet 2006; Good 2007; Paul 2010). Local anaesthetics 
may be used as a field block to create local analgesia around an injury, surgical site, or tissue plane or 
as a peripheral nerve block to create regional analgesia around a larger area. While conventional local 
anaesthetics  are  commonly  used  because  of  their  long-standing  benefit-risk  profile,  their  duration  of 
effect  is  typically  shorter  than  the  duration  of  moderate-to-severe  postsurgical  pain,  which  can  often 
extend for several days. 
Two  primary  treatment  options  to  provide  an  extended  duration  of  analgesia  for  moderate-to-severe 
pain are continuous peripheral nerve blocks or opioid analgesics. However, both treatment options come 
with clinical limitations: 
•  Continuous  peripheral  nerve  blocks  (CPNBs)  require  placement  of  a  perineural  catheter,  local 
anaesthetic  pump,  infusion  management,  and  catheter  site  care,  which  are  technically 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 8/147 
 
  
 
 
challenging  and  resource  intensive.  CPNBs  carry  risks  for  bacterial  colonisation,  infection, 
mechanical failure of the pump, catheter migration or dislodgement, wet bandages, and patient 
compliance issues (Jeng 2010; Joshi 2016). 
•  Opioid analgesics are associated with a high burden of opioid-related adverse events (ORAEs) 
such  as  respiratory  depression,  nausea,  vomiting,  constipation,  somnolence,  pruritus,  urinary 
retention, dysphoria, and delirium. ORAEs have been shown to increase hospital costs, increase 
lengths of hospital stay, impair patient outcomes, and increase the likelihood of readmission (de 
Boer 2013; Doan 2019; Kessler 2013; Oderda 2013; Shafi 2018). Management of ORAEs often 
requires the administration of additional medications including, but not limited to, antiemetics, 
anti-constipation agents, and anti-pruritus agents (Viscusi 2011). 
Postoperative pain is not adequately managed in a significant proportion of patients and is associated 
with  a  broad  range  of  negative  consequences,  including  increased  morbidity,  development  of  chronic 
postoperative pain, impaired function, recovery from surgery, and quality of life, and prolonged opioid 
use (Gan, 2017). If pain is not controlled in the immediate post-operative period there may be several 
deleterious consequences such as delayed wound healing, extended hospital stay and the development 
of chronic pain syndromes (Macrae, 2001; Bonnet and Marret, 2005). Untreated or undertreated severe 
postoperative  pain  has  many  deleterious  effects  on  respiration,  circulation,  autonomic  activity,  renal 
function, and gastrointestinal activity. 
Inadequately  managed  acute  postoperative  pain  is  associated  with  effects  related  to  aspects  of  both 
physiological and psychological function.  
Changes can occur in diverse organ systems, including the cardiovascular (coronary ischemia, myocardial 
infarction), pulmonary (hypoventilation, decreased vital capacity, pulmonary infection), gastrointestinal 
(reduced motility, ileus, nausea, vomiting), and renal (increases in urinary retention and sphincter tone, 
oliguria)  systems.  A  negative  impact  may  also  be  seen  on  immune  function,  the  muscular  system, 
coagulation, and wound healing. Finally, poorly controlled pain after surgery may impair sleep and have 
negative  psychological  effects,  such  as  demoralisation  and  anxiety.  Unrelieved  pain  has  considerable 
consequences as inadequate pain control post-operatively can result in increased morbidity and length 
of hospital stay and may lead to chronic pain (Raksamani, 2013). 
Bupivacaine HCl is the current standard of care for post-surgical analgesia as one of the long-acting local 
anaesthetics, but even so it has a limited duration of action after local administration, usually reported 
as less than 8-12 hours (MARCAIN SmPC 2016). 
2.2.  About the product 
Exparel is a prolonged-release liposomal dispersion of bupivacaine at a nominal concentration of 13.3 
mg/mL. 
Bupivacaine is one of the longer-acting local anaesthetics; thus, it is commonly administered to provide 
analgesia following surgery or a traumatic injury. However, the duration of action of IR bupivacaine is 
limited with a labelled duration of effect of up to 8 hours. Since moderate-to-severe acute pain following 
surgery  or  injury  from  trauma  often  lasts  longer  than  the  duration  of  action  offered  by  current 
formulations of local anaesthetics, the rationale for developing Exparel has been to provide prolonged 
acute pain management via a single administration as a field block or peripheral nerve block.

2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a liposomal prolonged-release dispersion for injection containing 
13.3 mg/ml bupivacaine (expressed as bupivacaine base) as active substance.  
Other  ingredients  are:  dierucoylphosphatidyl  choline  (DEPC),  dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol  (DPPG), 
cholesterol, tricaprylin, sodium chloride, phosphoric acid and water for injections. 
The  product 
is  available 
in  10  mL  or  20  mL,  single-use  Type  I  glass  vials  with  an 
ethylenetetrafluoroethylene-faced grey butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium/polypropylene flip-tear-
up seal. 
Each vial of 10 mL prolonged-release dispersion for injection contains 133 mg bupivacaine. 
Each vial of 20 mL prolonged-release dispersion for injection contains 266 mg bupivacaine. 
Note:  During  the  procedure  the  name  of  the  medicinal  product  changed  (from  ‘Exparel’  to  ‘Exparel 
liposomal’) and the pharmaceutical form changed to a new EDQM standard term (from ‘suspension for 
injection’ to ‘prolonged-release dispersion for injection’). The previous term “suspension for injection” 
was  kept  to  express  drug  product  pharmaceutical  form  throughout  the  MAA  dossier  Modules  1-5  and 
also may appear in this Assessment Report. 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  bupivacaine  is  (RS)-1-butyl-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)piperidine-2-carboxamide 
corresponding to the molecular formula C18H28N2O. It has a relative molecular mass 288.43 and has the 
following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white or almost white crystalline powder, crystals or granules. 
It is soluble in methanol, ethanol and acetone and sparingly soluble in water and light petroleum ether.  
Bupivacaine exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre and it is stated that it is 
manufactured as a racemic mixture.  
Polymorphism  has been  observed  for  the  active  substance.  Bupivacaine base can  be  observed  in  two 
polymorph  forms  (Form  I  and  Form  II).  Both  forms  have  been  characterised.  Bupivacaine  base 
manufactured by the two active substance manufacturers corresponds to the stable polymorph Form I. 
Both forms can be distinguished by melting point. Bupivacaine HCl is the subject of a monograph in the 
Ph.  Eur.  but  no  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  is  available  for  the  proposed  bupivacaine  base  used  as  active 
substance in the finished product. There is indication that draft work has started on a monograph (02761) 
on EDQM’s website.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
There are two manufacturers of active substance. The documentation on the active substance from both 
manufacturers  is  presented  using  an  Active  Substance  Master  File  (ASMF)  procedure.    Detailed 
information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMFs and it was considered satisfactory. 
Bupivacaine is synthesised using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Adequate 
in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for 
intermediate  products,  starting  materials  and  reagents  have  been  presented.  The  carry-over  of  raw 
materials, impurities and solvents has been addressed. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards 
to their origin and characterised. Discussion on impurities and on their mutagenic potential according to 
ICH M7 has been provided. 
The active substance packaging materials comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, HPLC, GC, melting 
point), optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), colour of solution (UV), sulphated ash (USP / Ph. Eur.), loss on drying 
(USP  /  Ph.  Eur.),  water  (USP  /  Ph.  Eur.),  related  substances  (HPLC,  GC),    2,6-Xylidine  (HPLC,  GC), 
residual solvents (GC), assay (titration), microbial enumeration (USP / Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins 
(USP / Ph. Eur.). 
Impurity  limits  were  set  in  line  with  ICH  Q3A  guideline  and  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  Different  residual 
solvents are controlled in the active substance from each supplier. Finished product manufacturer applies 
the same and/or equivalent analytical procedures as the manufacturers. 
A  suitable  method  for  showing  that  the  active  substance  is  a  racemate  has  been  included  in  the 
specification of bupivacaine. Lack of test for polymorph form is acceptable considering that Bupivacaine 
is dissolved during the manufacturing process of finished product.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods) 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for identification and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analyses data from the applicant for six recent batches of bupivacaine base active substance, three 
batches from each of the two suppliers has been provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  were  provided  on  twelve  batches  of  active  substance  from  one  manufacturer  stored  in 
container  representative  of  the  commercial  container-closure  system  for  up  to  48  months  under  long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and on six batches for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity, water, chromatographic purity, assay, 2,6-
Xylidine, XRPD. All tested parameters were within the specifications. Photostability testing following the 
ICH guideline Q1B was performed showing the active substance is not sensitive to light. 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 11/147 
 
  
 
 
Results on stress conditions (temperature (60°C), light (1.2 million lux hours given by ICHQ1b), moisture 
(>90% humidity), oxidative conditions using H2O2 and pH (pH 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11)) were also provided. 
There were no significant changes observed under the stress conditions apart from the degradation of 
Bupivacaine base found under oxidative conditions. As this degradant was not seen under accelerated 
conditions up to 21 months, it is not considered a degradant requiring control in the specification.  
Stability data were provided on seven batches of active substance from the second manufacturer stored 
in container representative of the commercial container-closure system for up to 60 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and/or at 30 ºC / 70% RH (to comply with ICH zone IVB conditions) 
and for up to 12 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, colour of solution, water content, impurities by GC, 
2,6-Xylidine, assay. All tested parameters were within the specifications. Photostability testing following 
the ICH guideline Q1B was performed showing the active substance is not sensitive to light. 
Results on stress conditions (oxidative H2O2, temperature (105°C), light) were also provided. The forced 
degradation studies indicate that Bupivacaine is a rather stable compound. Degradation of Bupivacaine 
base  was  found  under  oxidative  conditions,  but  not  considered  relevant  to  the  commercial  storage 
conditions. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently  stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  periods  of  48  months  (first 
manufacturer) and 60 months (second manufacturer) in the proposed container with no special storage 
conditions. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Exparel  liposomal  prolonged  release  dispersion  for  injection  is  a  sterile,  white  to  off-white  aqueous 
dispersion  of  multivesicular  lipid-based  particles  (DepoFoam®  drug  delivery  system)  containing 
bupivacaine  at  a  concentration  of  13.3  mg/mL.  The  concentration  of  13.3  mg/mL  is  expressed  as 
bupivacaine base, which is equivalent to 15.0 mg/mL bupivacaine hydrochloride.  
Exparel liposomal prolonged release dispersion for injection is provided in 133 mg/10 mL and 266 mg/20 
mL vial configurations. It is packaged in Type I clear glass vials with ethylenetetrafluoroethylene (ETFE)-
faced grey butyl rubber stoppers and aluminium/polypropylene flip-tear-up (FTU) seals.  
There are also several process aids used in the manufacturing process but not present in the finished 
product.  
The DepoFoam technology is based on a non-classical, multivesicular liposome (MVL) system. The MVL 
particles consist of a honeycomb-like structure with numerous non-concentric chambers containing drug 
dissolved in the internal aqueous phase. The aqueous chambers are separated from each other by lipid 
bilayers  that  are  composed  of  phospholipids,  cholesterol  and  triglycerides.  A  scanning  electron 
micrograph of a DepoFoam particle is shown in Figure 2.

Excipients 
The full list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
DEPC  (1,2-Dierucoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine)  is  a  novel  excipient  in  the  finished  product 
formulation. The other excipients are known pharmaceutical ingredients. Cholesterol, sodium chloride, 
phosphoric  acid,  water  for  injections  and  nitrogen  are  compendial  excipients.  It  is  considered  that 
tricaprylin  and  DPPG  (non-compendial  excipients)  are  not-novel  excipients  since  they  have  been 
previously registered in other medicinal products within the EU. Where relevant, the quality of excipients 
is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur  or  other  pharmacopoeial  standards.  Appropriate  quality  specifications  have 
been set for the non-compendial excipients.  
It  is  recommended  that  additional  validation  of  the  analytical  methods  used  by  the  excipient 
manufacturer for control of microbiological purity for DPPG and tricaprylin and validation of method for 
control  of  bacterial  endotoxins  for  tricaprylin  should  be  submitted  post  approval.  Furthermore,  it  is 
considered that the tests for unspecified impurities in DPPG and tricaprylin should be revalidated and the 
limit be tightened in line with Ph. Eur. The applicant agreed to these recommendations as a post approval 
commitment. (Note: Since the finished product manufacturer will test DPPG, tricaprylin batches for BET 
and  microbial  contamination,  there  are  no  concerns  that  non-compliant  batches  could  be  used  in 
manufacturing process of finished product. 
Novel excipient DEPC (1,2-Dierucoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine) 
Two suppliers of the novel excipient DEPC are proposed. Full manufacturing process, quality controls and 
information  on  stability  have  been  submitted  in  the  quality  dossier.  A  single  consolidated  DEPC 
specification including the tests, acceptance criteria and test methods for the two suppliers is provided 
by the finished product manufacturer. 
All questions raised relating to the DEPC novel excipient from both suppliers have been resolved. It is 
recommended  that  additional  confirmatory  validation  data  of  analytical  methods  for  control  of 
microbiological purity, bacterial endotoxins and impurity for DEPC should be submitted post approval. 
Furthermore, it is considered that the test for unspecified impurities in DEPC should be revalidated and 
the limit be tightened in line with Ph. Eur. The applicant agreed to these recommendations as a post 
approval commitment.  (note: Since the finished product manufacturer will test DPPG, tricaprylin batches 
for BET and microbial contamination, there are no concerns that non-compliant batches could be used 
in manufacturing process of finished product.) 
Formulation development 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 13/147 
 
  
 
 
 
The  development  of  the  product  including  the  selection  of  excipients  is  largely  based  on  the  prior 
knowledge on products (previously approved in Europe), that have been developed using multivesicular 
liposomes technology. The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) of the product was defined. The Critical 
Quality  Attributes  (CQA)  were  identified  based on  the  QTPP.  Formulations used  in  the  various  clinical 
trials were described.  
Development of an in vitro release (IVR) test method has been described. During the procedure a major 
objection was raised regarding the proposed sampling points and acceptance limits for the IVR test. The 
applicant  provided  further  data  and  additional  explanation  as  well  as  statistical  evaluation  of 
approximately 3,000 commercial drug product batches manufactured since product approval in the US. 
CHMP  concluded  that  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  proposed  IVR  test  method  provides  reliable 
quality control of the product to assess manufacturing variability at initial release and to measure product 
stability, in combination with the other quality attribute tests in the finished product specification.  
Manufacturing process development 
Bupivacaine  suspension  for  injection  is  manufactured  via  an  aseptic  process  through  a  sequence  of 
following  steps:  emulsification,  solvent  removal,  buffer  exchange,  pooling,  potency  adjustment  (as 
necessary), fill/closure. 
Choice  of  sterilisation  method  was  discussed  in  line  with  Decision  Trees  for  Selection  of  Sterilisation 
Methods (Annex to NfG on Development Pharmaceutics). The choice of aseptic processing is considered 
reasonable. During the procedure a major objection was raised on the theoretical risk of sterility/BET 
failure. In response, the applicant revised the specifications for active substance bupivacaine and for the 
excipients used for lipid solution preparation. The test parameters microbiological purity and bacterial 
endotoxin testing (BET) are now included in all the relevant active substance and excipient specifications. 
Container closure system 
The container closure systems consist of 10 mL and 20 mL Type I glass vials (13-mm neck), an ETFE 
(ethylenetetrafluoroethylene)  faced  grey  butyl  stopper,  and  an  aluminum/polypropylene  flip-tear-up 
(FTU) seal. The vial design studies were performed to identify the key parameters that affect the stability 
of the product during shipping. The target fill volumes have been set. Extractable studies performed on 
the  vials  and  stoppers  resulted  in  no  extractables  (vials)  or  very  low  levels  of  rubber  oligomers 
(stoppers). According to results during stability study there was no differences in stability between vials 
stored upright and inverted indicating no adverse interaction between the product and stopper. In view 
of  the  extractable  studies  provided,  migration  studies  are  not  necessary.  The  material  complies  with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Compatibility 
The compatibility of bupivacaine suspension for injection with several implant materials (hernia mesh / 
PP and ePTFE, silicone materials, stainless steel and titanium alloys) were tested, the studies involved 
testing of exposed materials and key characteristics of finished product after exposure of product with 
implanted  material  for  7  days.  It  was  concluded  that  characteristics  of  implanted  materials  are  not 
affected by the exposure to finished product.  
Exparel suspension for injection could be administered undiluted or diluted. Study regarding compatibility 
of bupivacaine suspension for injection and 0.9% NaCl solution and Ringer’s lactate has been done by 
the  applicant.  Different  dilution  factors  were  used  for  a.m.  solutions.  The  content of  free  bupivacaine 
was  chosen  as  indicator  of  compatibility.  Conclusion  is  that  increase  of  free  bupivacaine  is  directly 
proportional  to  the  dilution  factor  used  (if  dilution  factor  is  higher,  increase  of  free  bupivacaine  is 
observed).  
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 14/147 
 
  
 
 
Effect of storage time in syringe after dilution with 0.9% NaCl solution has been studied. Dilution factors 
1, 2, 15 were used. There were additional slow increases in free bupivacaine after dilution with 0.9% 
NaCl solution and when stored at 25°C. No effect on particle size distribution and pH has been observed.  
It has been confirmed that needle size and mixing order has no influence on the quality of Exparel and 
it should be administered with a 25 gauge or larger bore needle. 
Compatibility of Exparel with some local anaesthetics has been provided. Conclusion is that Bupivacaine 
hydrochloride and Exparel may be administered simultaneously in the same syringe, and bupivacaine 
hydrochloride may be injected immediately before Exparel as long as the ratio of the milligram dose of 
bupivacaine  hydrochloride  solution  to  Exparel  does  not  exceed  1:2.  Non-bupivacaine  based  local 
anaesthetics,  including  lidocaine,  may  cause  an  immediate  release  of  bupivacaine  from  Exparel  if 
administered together locally. The administration of Exparel may follow the administration of lidocaine 
after a delay of 20 minutes or more.  
According  to  studies  Exparel  could  be  compatible  with  epinephrine,  bacitracin,  cefazolin,  gentamycin, 
morphine  sulfate,  ketorolac  tromethamine.  It  could  be  co-administrated  with  cefuroxime,  clonidine, 
tranexamic acid. The applicant stated that a.m studies were performed in order to better understand 
medicinal product characteristics and no addition to product information is proposed at this stage.  
Exparel  is  not  compatible  with  dosing  combinations  containing  local  anaesthetics  such  as  Naropin 
(ropivacaine) and should not be mixed prior to administration with corticosteroids. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: emulsification solvent removal, buffer 
exchange,  pooling,  potency  adjustment  (as  necessary)  and  fill/finish  (depyrogenated  glass  vials, 
sterilised stoppers and aluminium caps). The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing 
process. 
Sterilisation  cycles/conditions  of  primary  packaging  components  are  described.  Vials  are  dry-heat 
sterilised using a depyrogenation tunnel. A temperature greater than 220°C for a validated time is used 
with demonstration of a 3-log reduction in heat resistant endotoxins. Stoppers are steam sterilised using 
autoclave following Ph. Eur. reference Cycle (≥ 121°C for ≥15 minutes). Full characterisation of used 
filters is provided. Furthermore, the applicant has confirmed that all solution filters are for single use 
only. 
In-process control parameters and limits are described and are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process / pharmaceutical form.  
Proposed holding times based on process validation results as well as aseptic process simulations are 
confirmed. The applicant has clarified that proposed time is required to complete entire manufacturing 
process and carry out all quality control tests. Risk  Assessment to evaluate potential risks to product 
sterility and other product quality attributes was initiated by the applicant and found the risk to be low. 
Sterility assurance of the holding process and maximum holding time is verified in semi-annual media 
runs. 
The applicant has confirmed that the expiration period of a batch is calculated in accordance with the EU 
guideline NfG on Start of Shelf-Life of the Finished Dosage Form (CPMP/QWP/ 072/96). 
Process validation was performed. Media fill data summary are provided to support aseptic process and 
holding  times.  Suitability  of  sterilising  filters  used  in  the  manufacture  of  finished  product  has  been 
demonstrated. Filled, stoppered and sealed vials were challenged for container-closure integrity (by dye 
ingress  testing  followed  by  microbial  challenge  testing)  and  found  to  be  integral.  It  has  been 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 15/147 
 
  
 
 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; appearance, 
identity (UV, HPLC), total bupivacaine (HPLC), free bupivacaine (centrifugation/HPLC), packed particle 
volume  (PPV)  (centrifugation),  bupivacaine  degradation  products  (HPLC),  cholesterol  (HPLC),  particle 
size distribution (laser light scattering), in vitro  release (HPLC), pH (glass electrode), residual solvent 
(GC),  lipid  degradation  (HPLC),  particulate  contamination:  subvisible  particles  (Ph.  Eur.),  osmolality 
(vapour  pressure  osmometry),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  extractable  volume  (Ph.  Eur.), 
bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final  product  release  testing.  The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Proposed  specification  follows  general  recommendations  provided  in  ICH  Q6A  specifications:  test 
procedures  and  acceptance  criteria  for  new  drug  substances  and  new  drug  products:  chemical 
substances; ICH Q3B (R2) Impurities in new drug products (CPMP/ICH/2738/99) (reporting threshold 
0.1%,  ID  threshold  0.2%,  qualification  threshold  0.2%)  and  European  Pharmacopoeia.  The  total 
bupivacaine content is specified as 95.0% – 105.0% of the declared content at release and shelf-life. 
The acceptance criteria of all specification parameters are considered justified, they are based on the 
batch release and stability data or are compliant with the Ph.Eur. requirements or quality guidelines.  
Potential impurities in the finished product originate from the active substance (bupivacaine free base), 
the  lipid  components  (DEPC,  DPPG,  tricaprylin,  and  cholesterol),  and  the  processing  aids  used  in  the 
finished product manufacturing process .Hydrolysis of the amide bond in bupivacaine produces Ph. Eur. 
impurity F (2,6-xylidine) and N-butyl-2-piperidine carboxylic acid, in equimolar ratio, therefore only Ph. 
Eur. impurity F is controlled in the finished product specification.  An oxidation product of bupivacaine is 
controlled in the finished product specification. 
These  potential  impurities  in  the  finished  product  are  sufficiently  described  and  proposed  limits  for 
specified and unspecified impurities are acceptable including limit for 2,6-Xylidine which does not exceed 
the  level  of  acceptable  daily  intake  of  mutagenic  compounds  recommended  in  ICH  M7  based  on  less 
conservative approach of LTL exposure. The acceptance criteria for individual and total impurities comply 
with the batch results, stability studies taking into consideration the natural variance of results or are 
even tighter than Q3B(R2) requirement therefore is acceptable. During the procedure a major objection 
was raised on the applicant’s initial proposal to exclude impurities testing from shelf-life specification. In 
response  the  applicant  updated  the  shelf-life  specification  to  include  the  parameter  for  control  of 
degradation  products,  which  was  considered  acceptable.  Additional  potential  bupivacaine  related 
impurities deriving from the active substance synthesis which are not bupivacaine degradation products 
are controlled in the active substance. 
During the procedure a major objection was raised regarding the exclusion of lipid degradation products 
from the finished product specification. Extensive justification of potential lipid degradation products in 
finished  product  and  control  strategy  was  submitted  and  supported  by  forced  degradation  studies. 
Impurities  derived  from  synthesis  of  the  lipids  are  controlled  in  each  individual  lipid  component. 
Discussion  of  impurities  with  mutagenic  potential  as  per  requirements  of  ICH  M7  was  submitted.  In 
summary,  Leadscope  expert  rule-based  and  statistical  assessment  is  performed,  4  impurities  are 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 16/147 
 
  
 
 
classified as Class 3 impurities and are controlled below TTC, the rest of impurities are classified as Class 
5. 
The applicant reviewed the product for potential presence of nitrosamine impurities and conducted a risk 
evaluation. All potential route sources of nitrosamines impurities are considered in the risk assessment. 
Despite the fact that three raw materials and a number of impurities and degradation products have the 
potential to be nitrosable substances, no nitrosating agents are used and are not present as impurities 
in  the  Exparel  manufacturing  process,  therefore,  the  risk  of  nitrosamines  formation  in  the  Exparel 
manufacturing process is negligible.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities, Option 2B. Batch analysis data on 
3 batches using a validated method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity 
was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented 
batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the 
finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Batch details and batch analyses data are provided for more than 100 batches of finished product used 
in  clinical  studies,  toxicology  studies,  stability  studies  to  register  the  product  in  the  US,  process 
validation, and recent commercial lots manufactured for U.S. distribution. The analytical methods used 
for  initial  release  testing  of  the  U.S.  FDA  registration  batches,  process  validation  batches  and  recent 
commercial batches presented in the batch analyses tables are the same as those described the current 
dossier. The batch data complies with the proposed specification and are consistent between batches 
and manufacturing sites. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 60 batches of finished product stored for up to 30 months under long term conditions 
(5°C±3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of Exparel are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The studies included batches manufactured at 
both  sites.  Different  suppliers  of  excipients  (DEPC,  cholesterol)  and  active  substance  were  used  for 
manufacturing of medicinal product batches used in stability studies. 
Batches were tested for parameters susceptible to change during storage: appearance, total bupivacaine, 
free  bupivacaine,  packed  particle  volume,  bupivacaine  degradation  products,  particle  size,  in  vitro 
release, pH, lipid degradation, particulate contamination, bacterial endotoxins and sterility.  
At long term storage conditions the obtained results for all parameters are according to specification. At 
accelerated  conditions  appearance  of  the  suspension  changed  (aggregation)  and  particle  size  also 
increased.  Some  additional  studies  have  been  performed  by  the  applicant  investigating  the  effect  of 
temperature cycling, photostability, freezing, effect of mechanical stress and storage configuration, in-
use stability in PP syringes, acid and base hydrolysis and oxidative degradation have been studied. It 
was  confirmed  that  finished  product  is  not  sensitive  to  temperature  cycling  between  5°C  and  25°C, 
hydrolytic  degradation  and  to  light  exposure,  but  is  sensitive  to  temperatures  above  40°C  and  to 
oxidation  as  well  as  to  freezing.  Minimal  sensitivity  to  mechanical  stress  is  confirmed.  Sensitivity  to 
elevated  temperatures  resulting  in  possible  aggregation  after  certain  period  of  time  accompanied  by 
increase in particle size, free bupivacaine content and lipid degradation is also confirmed. 
To  demonstrate  the  effect  of  mechanical  stress  on  the  quality  of  Exparel,  the  applicant  has  provided 
shipping  study  data,  which  additionally  justify  the  increased  limit  of  free  bupivacaine  in  shelf  life 
specification. 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 17/147 
 
  
 
 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Based on these results, the drug product packaged in clear Type I 
glass vials is stable upon exposure to light and does not require further protection. 
The proposed in-use shelf-life of 48 h at 5°C and 6 h at 25°C of the medicinal product in PP syringes is 
acceptable and supported by the submitted data. After dilution, chemical and physical in-use stability of 
Exparel when admixed with other formulations of bupivacaine has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 
room  temperature  (below  25°C).  When  admixed  with  9  mg/mL  (0.9%)  sodium  chloride  or  lactated 
Ringer’s solution, chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours when stored 
in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C) and at room temperature (below 25°C).  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years with storage conditions ‘store in a 
refrigerator (2-8°C), do not freeze’ as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Except for cholesterol all other excipients are from non-animal and non-human origin.  
A TSE/BSE statement is provided from each ASMF holder/active substance manufacturer to confirm that 
the active substance Bupivacaine base is manufactured without any material of animal or human origin. 
Adequate TSE/BSE statements from the manufacturers of three non-compendial excipients (DEPC, DPPG 
and  tricaprylin)  are  also  provided.  For  cholesterol,  the  only  excipient  of  animal  origin,  current  valid 
versions of TSE CEPs are enclosed. 
Other  compendial  materials  (phosphoric  acid  and  sodium  chloride)  used  in  the  manufacture  of 
bupivacaine, suspension for injection are chemicals that should not be a source of adventitious agents. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The major objections raised during the procedure have been satisfactorily resolved.  
MO on sterility assurance was resolved as the applicant added the test parameters microbiological purity 
and bacterial endotoxin testing (BET) in all relevant active substance and excipient specifications. 
MO on applicant’s initial proposal to exclude impurities testing from shelf-life specification was resolved 
as  the  applicant  updated  the  shelf-life  specification  to  include  a  parameter  for  control  of  degradation 
products. 
MO  regarding  the  proposed  sampling  points  and  acceptance  limits  for  the  IVR  test  was  resolved  as 
applicant  provided  further  data  and  additional  explanation  as  well  as  statistical  evaluation  of 
approximately 3,000 commercial drug product batches manufactured since product approval in the US. 
MO  regarding  the  exclusion  of  lipid  degradation  products  from  the  finished  product  specification  was 
resolved by adding a test for lipid degradation to finished product specification, supported by extensive 
justification of potential lipid degradation products in finished product, the control strategy and forced 
degradation studies.  
The applicant reviewed the product for potential presence of nitrosamine impurities and conducted a risk 
evaluation. The risk of nitrosamines formation in the Exparel manufacturing process is negligible. 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor quality issues having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  product.  These  are  addressed  below  as  recommendations  for  future  quality 
development. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  Validation of the analytical methods used by the excipient manufacturer for control of 
microbiological purity for DEPC, DPPG and tricaprylin and validation of methods for control of 
bacterial endotoxins for DEPC and tricaprylin should be performed and submitted. 
2.  Additional validation of the analytical method used by the excipient manufacturer for control of 
peroxide value of DEPC should be performed and submitted. 
3.  The excipient manufacturer should evaluate the DEPC method for control of impurities and, if a 
new  method  is  needed,  its  development  and  validation  should  be  completed.  Should  the 
evaluation conclude that the current method is suitable but needs additional validation, this too 
should be completed. Once a suitable method is validated with the tightened limit for unspecified 
impurities the respective sections should be updated accordingly, and the change reported by 
means of an appropriate variation procedure.  
4.  The excipient manufacturer should evaluate the DPPG method for control of impurities and, if a 
new  method  is  needed,  its  development  and  validation  should  be  completed.  Should  the 
evaluation conclude that the current method is suitable but needs additional validation, this too 
will be completed. Once a suitable method is validated with the tightened limit for unspecified 
impurities included in the specification, the respective sections should be updated accordingly, 
and the change reported by means of an appropriate variation procedure. 
5.  The excipient manufacturer should evaluate the Tricaprylin method for control of impurities and, 
if  a  new  method  is  needed,  its  development  and  validation  should  be  completed.  Should  the 
evaluation conclude that the current method is suitable but needs additional validation, this too 
will be completed. Once a suitable method is validated with the tightened limit for unspecified 
impurities the respective sections should be updated accordingly, and the change reported by 
means of an appropriate variation procedure. 
Note: The excipient manufacturer has committed to address these quality recommendations. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical program was designed to support the administration of Exparel as a field block and as a 
peripheral nerve block; however, other routes have been tested and the results are presented to 
further support the safety of Exparel. The toxicology program also included additional studies on 
placebo (DepoFoam containing no bupivacaine) in order to qualify the excipients, including dierucoyl

phosphatidylcholine (DEPC) and tricaprylin. DEPC is a novel excipient in Exparel and has not been used 
in the formulation of any previously approved pharmaceutical products in the European Union (EU). In 
addition, references were provided to published literature to support other aspects of the nonclinical 
programme. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Exparel was developed to provide prolonged local or regional analgesia via a single administration as a 
field block or peripheral nerve block.  
The mechanism of action and the pharmacological profile of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine, the local 
and  regional  anaesthetic  properties  and  the  analgesic  effects  of  bupivacaine  have  been  extensively 
characterised and described in the literature. Adequate literature review has been submitted.  In-depth 
pharmacological investigations on bupivacaine alone or in combination with other drugs have not been 
conducted because the effects of bupivacaine have been well documented in various efficacy models in 
the rodent and other species.   
Given  the decades of  clinical  experience  with  IR  bupivacaine  in  the  proposed  indications  and the  well 
characterised  pharmacological  action  of  bupivacaine  in  the  literature,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic 
evaluation was limited to one study in guinea pigs using a dermal wheal/pin prick model to evaluate the 
duration of anaesthetic effect and injection site irritation. Non-GLP pilot study RES 0801 SKY0402-059 
suggests that Exparel produces a sustained analgesic effect compared with IR bupivacaine in a dermal 
wheal/pin prick model in guinea pigs. The objective was to study the duration of anaesthetic effect and 
injection  site  irritation  of  DepoBupivacaine  and  bench-scale  placebo  administered  by  intradermal 
injection in a guinea pig wheal/pin prick model. DepoBupivacaine was found to have good antinociceptive 
activity  through  at  least  6  hours  compared  to  IR  Bupivacaine.  At  the  highest  dose  (17.72  mg/mL)  it 
caused a well-defined erythema.  
The  data  obtained  from  this  study  are  not  considered  of  sufficient  quality  to  generate  definitive 
conclusions  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  Exparel;  however,  given  that  the  mechanism  of  action  of 
bupivacaine that is released from DepoFoam is indistinguishable from commercially available bupivacaine 
HCl solutions, and the fact that bupivacaine (as bupivacaine HCl) has been marketed worldwide for over 
50 years and thoroughgoingly studied, it can be considered that the provided data altogether provide 
sufficient  evidence  to  prove  the  effects  and  mode  of  action  of  Exparel.  In  addition,  the  data  from 
performed GLP toxicology studies support the efficacy and mode of action of Exparel.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Secondary  pharmacodynamics  profile  of  bupivacaine  has  been  described  in  the  literature.  Published 
results have demonstrated that bupivacaine interacts with various components of the immune system, 
and  may  reduce  inflammatory  pain,  inhibit  bacterial  growth,  possibly  even  mitigate  perioperative 
inflammatory injury and protect against epidural abscesses. Secondary PD evaluation was limited to a 
one  non-GLP  in  vitro  study:  In  Vitro  Effect  of  SKY0402  on  Whole  Blood  Coagulation  Using  Activated 
Clotting  Time.  The  objective  was  to  evaluate  whether  SKY0402  in  clinically  relevant  concentrations 
interferes with whole blood coagulation, as measured by activated clotting time (ACT) using a Hemochron 
instrument.  The  in  vitro  data  were  compared  to  results  obtained  with  bupivacaine  HCl  solution.  The 
results of non-GLP study CeeTox 9032-081 demonstrate that both Exparel and IR bupivacaine at high 
concentration (8.86 µM) slightly prolonged ACT in human blood at 1 hour of exposure.  There was no 
detectable  difference  in  ACT  between  Exparel  (1.4  or  2.9 µg/mL)  and  saline  control  at  3 hours.  The 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 20/147 
 
  
 
 
concentrations of SKY0402 and bupivacaine HCl solution used in this experiment are considered clinically 
relevant.  
Safety pharmacology 
As  the  safety  pharmacology  of  bupivacaine  is  well  characterised,  no  formal  studies  on  liposomal 
bupivacaine have been conducted and a review of relevant published literature references was provided. 
The  effects  of  bupivacaine  acting  on  the  neurological  and  cardiovascular  systems  have  been  well 
documented in the medicinal literature. Because the same types of Na+ channels are present in most 
types of neurons, bupivacaine blocks impulse conduction in all types of nerve cells, including sensory, 
motor, autonomic, and CNS neurons. Bupivacaine affects electrocardiography parameters.  In increasing 
concentrations,  it  can  produce  bradycardia,  diminished  contractility,  atrioventricular  blockade, 
vasodilation, and eventually cardiac arrest. Animal studies of bupivacaine have shown that bupivacaine 
increases both QRS and QTc duration, and decreases CO.  These results have been shown in multiple 
models, including dogs, rabbits, and piglets. However, the concentrations seen are greater than the ones 
seen  in  human  studies.  Changes  to  PK,  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  blood  pressure,  and  respiration 
parameters were also evaluated as part of the nonclinical toxicology programme for Exparel.   
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  of  Exparel  have  not  been  performed.  A  review  of  relevant 
published literature references was provided. Drug interactions of bupivacaine are well defined through 
existing  literature  and  the  long-standing  experience  of  the  therapeutic  use  of  bupivacaine.  Exparel  is 
expected to have a similar drug interaction potential as bupivacaine.  Although the DepoFoam component 
of Exparel has no known pharmacodynamic drug interactions, Exparel should not be mixed with local 
anaesthetics other than IR bupivacaine due to their potential to displace and release bupivacaine from 
DepoFoam.

2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Given the long history of clinical use of bupivacaine, an abridged nonclinical program was designed and 
executed  to  support  the  clinical  development.  Additional  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  of 
studies were not conducted. This is considered acceptable as the distribution, metabolism, and excretion 
of  bupivacaine  after  release  from  the  DepoFoam  particles  in  vivo  are  expected  to  be  the  same  as  IR 
bupivacaine. 
Absorption 
The absorption properties of bupivacaine are well documented in the literature. As a part of the Exparel 
development program, the applicant conducted PK studies to determine the rate of bupivacaine release 
from DepoFoam and systemic exposure over time.  
The  retention  of  bupivacaine  at  the  injection  site  following  intradermal  or  subcutaneous  (SC) 
administration  of  Exparel  or  Placebo  (DepoFoam  containing  no  bupivacaine)  was  studied  in  rats  and 
guinea pigs. The PK of the retention of Exparel components in addition to DEPC (ie, DPPG, tricaprylin, 
cholesterol) at the site of injection was studied in rats. Of the three lipids at the site (DEPC, tricaprylin, 
and cholesterol), tricaprylin disappeared more quickly than DEPC and cholesterol. 
In addition, the absorption and PK of Exparel was compared with that of IR bupivacaine.  PK analyses of 
pilot and development scale Exparel test/control materials is provided, which includes batches used in 
PK studies, toxicology studies, and clinical studies.  PK data for clinical lots following SC administration 
in the rat model are also presented. In addition, process variants and effect of storage and temperature 
was studied following SC administration in the rat.  
Distribution 
The distribution of bupivacaine has been extensively characterised in the scientific literature and there 
is  long  standing  experience  on  the  therapeutic  use  with  approved  bupivacaine  medicinal  products  in 
Europe. The only distribution study that was conducted using Exparel was Study 16-SS-085, which was 
designed  to  determine  whether  bupivacaine-containing  Exparel  liposomal  particles  are  sequestered 
within  the  blood  cell  fraction  (whole  blood,  RBC  pellets,  and  plasma)  from  beagle  dogs  following 
centrifugation.  The results of Study 16-SS-085 suggest that there was no difference in the distribution 
of bupivacaine between the dogs treated with IR bupivacaine vs. Exparel. 
Metabolism 
No  formal  metabolism  studies  of  Exparel  were  conducted.  The  metabolism  of  bupivacaine  is  well 
characterised,  and  a  set  of  comprehensive  reviews  and  published  literature  references  have  been 
provided. 
Excretion 
No  formal  excretion  studies  of  Exparel  were  conducted.  The  excretion  of  bupivacaine  is  well 
characterised, and relevant literature information has been provided. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Drug interaction studies were focused on co-medications that may be administered to patients in the 
surgical setting prior to Exparel injection as part of multimodal analgesia (e.g., lidocaine/epinephrine or 
IR bupivacaine, frequently used as adjuncts to general anaesthesia). The mini-pig model is considered 
adequate to investigate the potential interaction of Exparel with lidocaine or IR bupivacaine because of 
its similarity (regarding the morphology and physiology) to humans.  
The PK profile for the different groups appeared to be a cumulative profile of Exparel and IR bupivacaine. 
The  extended-release  profile  of  Exparel  was  not  compromised.  Apparent  half-life  (t1/2)  and  tmax  for 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 22/147 
 
  
 
 
bupivacaine were not altered by the administration of IR bupivacaine concomitant with or prior to Exparel 
(S08668).  Consistent  with  its  extended-release  properties,  Exparel  has  a  relatively  modest  effect  on 
plasma  concentrations  when  used  in  combination  with  IR  bupivacaine  solution  (pre-mixed)  or  from 
sequential  administration  of  IR  bupivacaine  followed  by  Exparel  at  doses  up  to  4 times  that  of  IR 
bupivacaine and a wait time of up to 15 minutes.  
Based on the PK drug interaction studies (S07580 and S07607), administration of Exparel with lidocaine 
within  5  or  10 minutes  to  mini-pigs  produced  maximal  interactive  effects  on  systemic  exposure 
parameters (Cmax and AUC).  The susceptibility of Exparel to interact with lidocaine could be reduced by 
a 20- or 40-minute time interval after administration of lidocaine mixture, prior to Exparel administration 
(S07607). 
Distribution of Dierucoyl phosphatidylcholine (DEPC) 
The study QPS-137N-0401 objective was to determine the tissue distribution of DEPC and DEPC related 
material  following  a  single,  subcutaneous  (SC)  administration  of  a  DepoFoam  formulation  containing 
[14C-labelled DEPC] to male, pigmented rats using quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA). 
There  are  no  data  provided  regarding  metabolites  of  DEPC.  DEPC  is  a  synthetic  homolog  of 
dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) which is a natural lipid. Lipids such as DOPC and DEPC are subjected 
to oxidation of the fatty acid to generate energy or synthesise new lipids for storage. Once the DepoFoam 
vesicle  is  broken  down  into  individual  components  DEPC  is  expected  to  follow  the  lipid  catabolism 
pathways similar to a natural fatty acid.  
Distribution of Exparel lipid components in addition to DEPC (ie, DPPG, tricaprylin) was not evaluated. 
The  applicant  stated  that  regarding  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  of  the 
phospholipid (DOPC, DEPC, and DPPG) and neutral lipid (cholesterol, triolein, tricaprylin) components of 
the DepoFoam matrix, since these are all naturally occurring or synthetic analogues of common lipids, 
the metabolic fate of these excipients is expected to be similar to that of endogenous lipids. The applicant 
presented  an  overview  of  expected  absorption,  metabolism  and  excretion  of  lipid  components  of 
DepoFoam.  
In  summary,  the  pharmacokinetic  results  confirm  the  performance  characteristics  of  the  DepoFoam 
delivery system in all species tested. 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
Given  the  long  history  of  clinical use  of  bupivacaine,  an  abridged  toxicological  program  was  designed 
and executed to support the clinical development and the MAA of Exparel. This included single and repeat 
dose  toxicity  studies  to  evaluate  the  potential  local  and  systemic  toxicity  of  Exparel  relative  to  IR 
bupivacaine, placebo, and/or saline. Given the long history of therapeutic use of bupivacaine, and the 
proposed  single  dose  use  of  Exparel,  no  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  and  reproductive  and 
developmental toxicology studies of Exparel were conducted. Relevant information is provided from a 
review of the literature. 
The toxicology program included studies on Placebo (DepoFoam containing no bupivacaine) in order to 
qualify the excipients.  
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies with Exparel were performed in rats, dogs and rabbits utilizing same route 
of administration as it is intended in clinic (subcutaneous infiltration and perineural field block). In dogs 
and  rabbits  a  surgical  model  was  performed  to  assess  acute  toxicity  and  effect  on  wound  healing  as 
compared with bupivacaine HCl or saline.   
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 23/147 
 
  
 
 
The  applicant  performed  3  studies  with  Placebo  using  IV  route  and  3  studies  IV  and  IA  route  of 
administration as a way to qualify toxicity of the product and liposomal particles if it is to be accidentally 
administered IV or IA in clinical practice. Animals used were rats and dogs. In addition, 2 studies were 
performed using epidural and intrathecal route of administration. 
Histopathological  findings  from  the  SC  toxicity  of  Exparel  in  rats  (20995,  GLP)  indicated  statistically 
significant higher rates of chronic inflammation in subcutis and muscle tissue in female subjects when 
compared to males (data compared with Saline group at Day 3 post-injection). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  with  Exparel  and  Placebo.  Pivotal  toxicity  studies  with 
Exparel were performed in rabbits (4 weeks with twice weekly dosing and 4 weeks recovery) and dogs 
(4 weeks with twice-weekly dosing and 4 weeks recovery; 26 week monthly injections as femoral nerve 
block with 12 week recovery period). Due to the history of clinical use of bupivacaine, repeat dose toxicity 
studies of Exparel were not conducted in rodents.  
Repeat dose toxicity studies with placebo were performed in rats (28 consecutive days SC with 14 days 
recovery period) and dogs (28 consecutive days with 28 days recovery period). 
There was no evidence of neural degeneration after nerve block in rabbits or dogs, or degeneration of 
spinal cord tissues after ED dosing in rats or dogs.   
Convulsions were seen in NZW rabbits (MPI-947-036) with Exparel at 7.97 and 15.95 mg/kg, similar to 
IR bupivacaine at 7.97 mg/kg. The convulsions appeared to be associated with bupivacaine, and not the 
liposome formulation; however, it is unclear why convulsions were not seen at the highest bupivacaine 
level of 26.58 mg/kg. The absence of systemic effects with the highest dose of Exparel is likely due to 
biological  variability  and  could  have  been  further  explored.  Nevertheless,  the  same  administration 
scheme in the beagle dogs (study MPI-947-037) caused no such effects at either dose supporting safety 
of the Exparel. 
Exparel-related effects observed in the beagle dogs (MPI-947-037) were associated with the injection 
sites. With the low incidence and severity observed in these animals, this effect was considered to be an 
expected  response  to  the  liposomes  and  non-adverse.  The  high  dose  level  of  26.58  mg/kg/dose  was 
considered to be the NOAEL. 
 The only Exparel-related microscopic finding was minimal focal granulomatous inflammation in the fascia 
of  the  skeletal  muscle  surrounding  the  injection  site  at  the  24 mg/kg  dose  group,  which  completely 
recovered during the 12-week recovery period.  Due to the absence of Exparel-related changes at the 
mid dose level, 16 mg/kg was considered the No-Observed-Effect Level (NOEL).  Based on the evidence 
of complete reversal for the microscopic findings at 24 mg/kg, this dose was considered the NOAEL. 
Genotoxicity  
No formal in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity/mutagenicity studies were performed as part of the nonclinical 
program to assess the mutagenic and clastogenic potential of Exparel. The applicant refers to published 
literature. In addition, Placebo did not show any evidence of genotoxic activity in in vitro  and in vivo 
tests.  
Carcinogenicity 
No  formal  carcinogenicity  studies  on  Exparel  were  performed  as  part  of  the  nonclinical  program.  In 
accordance  with  ICH  Topic  S1A  The  Need  for  Carcinogenity  Studies  of  Pharmaceuticals  for 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 24/147 
 
  
 
 
pharmaceuticals  administered  infrequently  or  for  short  duration  of  exposure  (e.g.,  anaesthetics  and 
radiolabeled imaging agents) do not need carcinogenicity studies unless there is cause for concern. No 
cause of concern was raised from the results of repeat dose toxicity studies conducted with Exparel. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity were conducted with Exparel. A comprehensive 
review on available information for bupivacaine is provided.  
Reproductive toxicology of the Exparel Placebo (DepoFoam containing no bupivacaine) was evaluated in 
studies on embryofoetal development in rats and rabbits, and in a combined fertility and peri/postnatal 
study in rats.  
Epidural and Intrathecal Administration of Exparel 
Other  routes  of  administration  of  Exparel,  such  as  single  dose  epidural,  and  potential  inadvertent 
intrathecal administration, were also explored in GLP compliant studies in rats (MPI 947 031) and dogs 
(MPI 947 020) using IR bupivacaine for comparison. The performed studies were designed, performed 
and evaluated in line with the current regulations and recommendations.  
Local tolerance 
The  applicant  assessed  local  tolerance  as  part  of  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies,  some  of  the  single 
dose toxicity studies and performed separate studies of local tolerance including evaluation of injection 
site gross pathology and histopathology. Stand-alone studies of local tolerance were performed in guinea 
pigs, rabbits and dogs.  
Studies on the excipients 
An extensive toxicology program for Placebo (DepoFoam MVL) was performed. In order to provide the 
osmotic  balance  for  Placebo,  sucrose,  lysine  monohydrate,  and  phosphoric  acid  were  used  to  adjust 
osmolality inside the multivesicular liposomes.   
Studies on the excipients (including DEPC and tricaprylin) have indicated that they are without significant 
local  or  systemic  toxicity  at  single  or  repeated  doses,  and  that  it  has  no  genotoxic,  teratogenic,  or 
developmental  effects.  The  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  with  Placebo  revealed  no  significant  local  or 
systemic adverse effects in rats and dogs. In each species, the local injection reactions showed progress 
towards resolution after 14- or 28-Day recovery periods, respectively. 
Studies on impurities 
Studies on qualification of impurities are not needed to support this MAA as the impurities do not exceed 
ICH recommended levels.  
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment was performed to evaluate potential environmental risks of Exparel 
containing the active moiety bupivacaine. The submitted ERA relies on Phase I assessment.   
Estimation of exposure in phase I was based only on drug substance, which is considered acceptable. 
Indication  covered  in  assessment  was  prolonged  acute  pain  management  and  reduction  in  need  for 
opioids in adults compared to immediate release bupivacaine, with maximum daily dose of 266 mg of 
bupivacaine (20 ml of Exparel, concentration 13,3 mg/ml).Bupivacaine is a known substance widely used 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 25/147 
 
  
 
 
in existing authorised products in the EU.  The measured partition coefficient values of bupivacaine are 
below 4.5 (i.e., 0.5 at pH 5, 2.2 at pH 7 and 3.1 at pH 9). Therefore, it is not identified as a persistent, 
bioaccumulative  and  toxic  (PBT)  or  a  very  persistent  and  very  bioaccumulative  (vPvB)  substance.  As 
bupivacaine metabolites are expected to be more soluble in water than the parent drug substance, the 
risk for bioaccumulation of metabolites is also considered to be acceptable. 
Two calculations of the Phase I PECSURFACEWATER of bupivacaine (0.0036 and 0.0027 μg/L) did not exceed 
the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. Based on pre-clinical data of toxicity in developmental and reproductive 
toxicity  studies  in  mammalian  species,  bupivacaine  is  not  expected  to  affect  the  reproduction  of 
vertebrate  or  lower  animals  at  concentrations  lower  than  the  action  limit  of  0.01  μg/L.  Therefore,  a 
further Phase II environmental fate and effects assessment is not required.

2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Given the long history of clinical use of bupivacaine, an abridged nonclinical program was designed and 
executed to support the clinical development. In addition, references are provided to published literature 
to support other aspects of the nonclinical programme. 
Studies were designed to use the fewest number of animals possible, consistent with the objective of 
the study, the scientific, contemporary scientific standards, and in consideration of applicable regulatory 
requirements. No major deviations were made from the GLP study protocols. 
Primary pharmacology 
Pharmacology  of  this  drug  product  is  based  on  an  assumption  that  DepoFoam  is  responsible  for  its 
innovative mode of action. The precise mechanism involved in release of bupivacaine from DepoFoam 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 26/147 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
particles  is  unknown.  Two  mechanisms  were  proposed:  1)  Reorganisation  of  lipid  membrane  due  to 
tricaprylin  becoming  a  liquid  oil  at  body  temperature  and  leaving  particles  for  partition  into  the 
surrounding  tissues  leading  to  particle  destabilisation.  Unstable  particles  break  down  and  release 
bupivacaine,  2)  Diffusion of  free  base  buivacaine  from  the  particles.  In the  particles,  there is  a  small 
fraction  (0.001)  of  bupivacine  present  in  the  free  base  form  which  is  uncharged,  allowing  it  to  cross 
membranes. Released bupivacaine will drive futher diffusion of bupivacaine base out of the liposomes to 
maintian equilibrium. 
Exparel  is  a  specific  innovative  product  with  bupivacaine  as  a  known  active  substance  for  which  the 
pharmacology of the active substance is well known from extensive clinical practice and clinical literature 
from a period of over 50 years. There is no need to demonstrate primary pharmacodynamics in theory. 
Proof of concept for this product is in fact the proof of adequate pharmacokinetic profile in which the 
applicant has to prove prolonged release of bupivacaine on the site of application in the desired amount. 
Thus,  the  non-clinical  study  of  primary  pharmacodynamics  of  this  drug  product  design  could  be 
completely omitted in theory and focus placed on clinical PD of proposed formulation.  
Nevertheless,  some  points  need  to  be  noted.  The  applicant  submitted  one  study  in  which 
pharmacodynamics of the Depo bupivacaine formulation is demonstrated. Although the wheel/pin prick 
model  is  a  known  testing  model  in  animals  for  local  anaesthetic,  it  may  not  be  appropriate  for  the 
proposed drug formulation because it is important for DepoBupivacaine to prove that it remains at the 
injection site after SC injection or routes other than i/d. In this study the drug is applied intradermal, 
which  is  not  same  as  future  clinical  use.  According  to  the  applicant,  longer  retention  has  been 
demonstrated compared with IR bupivacaine, but the method used is questionable, since kinetics are 
different when applied intradermal and subcutaneous. There is a claim in the study that a series of sub-
studies was conducted which were performed in guinea pigs and rats to establish the animal model and 
feasibility of analytical method and that DepoBupivacaine was well tolerated in both Guinea pigs and rats 
following subcutaneous dosing, but DOC#91325 to which the applicant refers to is not presented. Results 
presented scarcely support prolonged analgesia claim since it is visible that after 48 hours only 2 out of 
5 pricks in the inner circle are negative with the highest dose applied (20 mg/mL). In the lower dose 
groups, there was no effect of Depo bupivacaine after 18 h. Also, there is no explanation why the animals 
where observed for 48 hours since the prolonged analgesia is claimed to be up to 72 hours in clinical 
setting.  Several other problems were identified in the submitted study. 1 ml was used intradermal which 
seems as a large volume for this route of administration and is a quite larger volume from those advised 
in literature (0,1 ml, Vogel, 2002.). It seems that only DepoBupivacaine was used per one animal. There 
was no control (standard) used in a second wheal on the same animal. The study from which the results 
of tests with IR are derived are not presented for verification of claims (RES-0301-SKY0402-018). Results 
of  rat  studies  and  SC  guinea  pig  studies  are  not  presented.  Several  errors  in  the  report  were  noted, 
among  others  the  species  “Sprague  Dawley  male  guinea  pigs,  Harlan”,  seems  it  is  not  one  species. 
Figures presented are not visible adequately. These are not considered very important concerns since it 
is a pilot study report for a well-established substance but it has to be noted. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Inhibition of coagulation by local anaesthetics in vitro is an effect already recorded in published literature 
(Ti and Li, 1999., Tobias et al., 1999., Kohrs, 1999.) and is not considered a major safety risk which 
could lead to prolonged bleeding in clinical setting at present time point. The applicant conducted an in 
vitro study on whole blood coagulation using activated clotting time but the last time point was 3 h post 
application of bupivacaine. Both bupivacaine HCl solution and SKY0402 at high concentration (10 μM) 
slightly prolonged ACT in human blood at the 1-hour exposure and no effects were seen at 3 hours in 
this in vitro study.  In the single-dose epidural and intrathecal toxicity study in dogs, there was a slight 
prolongation of the APTT in animals receiving IR bupivacaine or Exparel/Xylocaine. Although mild, this 
was  considered treatment-related.  The  applicant  argues that  no  effect on  PT and  APTT  is  seen  in  the

repeat-dose  subcutaneous  toxicity  studies.  In  Exparel  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  dogs  (947-037) 
and  rabbits  (947-036),  APTT  and  PT  were  investigated  pre-test  and  prior  to  terminal  and  recovery 
necropsies. There were no test article-related effects on these parameters. 
Lack of dedicated safety pharmacology studies and non-clinical PD studies is acceptable as a summary 
of  the  assessments  from  toxicology  studies  conducted  with  bupivacaine/Exparel  and  the  published 
literature on bupivacaine are provided. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Study  RES-0702-D0402-044 
indicates 
that  sustained 
release  of  bupivacaine  occurs  with 
DepoBupivacaine  formulations  as  compared  with  a  simple  aqueous  solution  of  bupivacaine.  For  both 
glucoronate  and  phosphate  lots,  plasma  bupivacaine  levels  were  observed  throughout  72  hours. 
Phosphate  lot  showed  somewhat  lower  Cmax  with  a  slower  release  of  bupivacaine  compared  to 
glucoronate lot.  
The  applicant  presented  a  study  report  (RES-73965),  which  is  a  compilation  of  several  experimental 
studies conducted in early stages of development of drug product, which makes it difficult to follow. 
The  applicant  states  that  DEPC  enters  normal  metabolic  pathways  upon  absorption  and,  although  a 
similar study has not been performed with the other lipid components, it may reasonably be expected 
that they undergo the same fate. DEPC remains on the site of administration longer than bupivacaine 
i.e. bupivacaine disappeared more rapidly than DEPC. The applicant concludes that DEPC disappeared 
more rapidly from the tissues between 7 and 14 days, and has disappeared completely from the site by 
21 days. This can only be stated for the guinea pig i/d part of the study which was followed up till day 
21. Other studies are not followed up after day 7 or 14.  
In the study RES-73965 there are differences between remaining dose of DEPC on day 7 in rats when 
given subcutaneously with and without bupivacaine (58% of injected dose remains on sight on 7th day 
when  given  with  bupivacaine  and  25.8%  of  injected  dose  remains  when  given  as  placebo,  both 
administered initially with the same amount of DEPC). It seems that the DEPC particles remain longer 
and  are  more  persistent  in  the  guinea  pig  (93%  of  injected  dose  of  DEPC  on  day  7  in  both  SC  and 
intradermal administration) regardless of the remaining bupivacaine content on the site on day 7 (4.3% 
when administered i/d, 23 %when administered SC). In other animals and other routes of administration, 
there is no follow up after 7 or 14 days. Regarding differences in the remaining dose of DEPC on day 7 
in rats, the applicant argues that the rate of decline in amount of DEPC is comparable because difference 
in remaining dose of DEPC is due to the variation in measured starting concentrations between groups 
(Exparel 119%, Placebo 97%). The applicant concludes that DEPC disappeared more rapidly from the 
tissues between 7 and 14 days, and has disappeared completely from the site by 21 days. Statement 
that DEPC disappears from the site by day 21 can still only be stated for the guinea pig i/d part of the 
study which was followed up till day 21. Other studies are not followed up after day 7 or 14.  
Regarding MPI-947-041, a study to compare PK of SKY0402 manufactured by two processes (decant vs. 
non-decant,  test  vs.  reference)  after  local  infiltration  in  male  dogs:  great  variability  in  individual  PK 
parameters can be seen in both group of dose animals – Tmax ranges from 0,5-96 h. Very high initial 
bupivacaine peaks are seen immediately after administration, which is not desirable for a depo product. 
Decanted SKY0402 was not bioequivalent to non-decanted SKY0402 at the level of 80 to 125%.  
Regarding MPI-947-040, a study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SKY0402 (decanted process) 
after local infiltration in a surgical repair model (“surgical wound”) compared to “normal tissues” (test 
vs.  reference),  Great  variability  in  individual  PK  parameters  can  be  seen:  Tmax  ranges  from  1  to  48 
hours.  
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 28/147 
 
  
 
 
Overall  applicability  of  this  study  is  questionable  because  the  applicant  concluded  that  decanted  and 
non—decanted  process  is  not  bioequivalent  in  dogs,  yet,  surgical  model  is  performed  with  decanted 
model  even  though  non-decanted  model  is  presented  for  MAA.  Inguinal  hernia  model  is  chosen  for 
“surgery model” to cover various indications including hernia repair, mastectomy, and Caesarean section 
in humans.  Assessor is of the opinion that this is not an appropriate surgery model because inguinal 
hernia  presents  protrusion  of  an  organ  or  tissue  through  a  natural  opening  in  the  abdominal  wall  - 
inguinal canal. During the staged surgery, it was only necessary to cut through the skin, bluntly reach 
peritoneum of the dogs and put a closure on fascias, aponeuroses and inguinal ligament. This is not a 
representative procedure for all clinical procedures, stated by the applicant, in which incision of deeper 
and other types of tissues must be done (caesarean section, mastectomy, and orthopaedic surgeries).  
In the study MPI-947-040 higher AUC and Cmax are seen in the surgery model. The applicant provided 
a scientific discussion on possible reasons for higher Cmax and AUC seen in surgery models in dogs in 
comparison  with  intact  skin.  Among  possible  physiological  changes  that  could  potentially  lead  to 
increased  absorption  of  bupivacaine  are:  injured  cells  which  release  inflammatory  chemical  signals 
leading  to  vasodilatation,  increased  blood  flow,  temperature  increase,  leaky  endothelial  lining  of  local 
blood vessels allowing neutrophils, macrophages and fluid to move into interstitial tissue. Recruitment 
of  dendritic  cells  and  macrophages  and  extracellular  proteases  released  from  neutrophils  could 
potentially increase the rate of breakdown of lipid nanoparticles.  
Non-clinical surgery model presented for hernia repair, mastectomy, and Caesarean section in humans 
but no models for surgical procedures in which bone tissue is affected, as these are prevalent procedures 
presented  in  clinical  dossier  (bunionectomy,  total  knee  arthroplasty,  total  shoulder  arthroplasty).  The 
applicant did not expect any differences in PK when bone tissues are affected by surgery. Bone tissues 
have no significant contribution to bupivacaine metabolism pathways and it is not expected that the bone 
tissue would significantly contribute to the metabolism, distribution or clearance of bupivacaine.  
The applicant conducted several studies to compare PK profiles of newly manufactured ExparelExparel 
lots. Tested lots were manufactured with some process modifications or were stored at different storage 
conditions. These studies cannot be considered as proper basic PK studies as their only aim was to verify 
new lots based on their PK profile in comparison with control lots in research and development phase of 
the  drug.  Therefore,  assessor  is  of  the  opinion  that  these  studies  do  not  significantly  contribute  to 
understanding of basic PK of this product and can be considered only as supportive studies. As such, 
they  should  be  presented  in  Other  pharmacokinetic  studies  and  should  not  be  assessed  in  depth. 
However, as the applicant did enclose these studies in basic pharmacokinetic part, there are some points 
regarding their conduction and interpretation that assessor wishes to point out. It is not clear why there 
was such a big difference in the concentration of control and test lots in the study 041018-D0402-534 
(control 25mg/ml that is 36 mg/kg compared to Test lots 14 and 15 mg/ml that is 20 and 21 mg/kg ). 
It is mentioned that difference between PK profile of control and tested lots could be result of this, but 
it does not answer the question why various concentrations were applied or why then the study was not 
repeated  with  equivalent  or  similar  concentrations  between  the  groups.  Despite  groups  had  been 
administered  with  different  concentrations  they  had  similar  Cmax  values.  It  is  not  clear  if  new  lots 
administered in same concentration as control lot would not produce much higher Cmax (and potentially 
produce toxic effect of bupivacaine). Also, in study RES-050502-D0402-608 where effects of different 
storage conditions were observed, there was big difference in concentrations of control and tested lots.  
Some results of these studies show that PK profiles of tested lots differ from control. The applicant did 
not  explain  how  and  whether  these  findings  affected  further  drug  development:  was  manufacturing 
process modified, and if so, how; or were tested clinical batches further used in clinical trials after these 
non-clinical studies were performed? In cases like this it is possible for applicant to refer to quality or 
clinical part of dossier in order to explain findings of non-clinical studies. But in this case, that was not 
done  in  any  part  of  non-clinical  documentation  for  this  application.  Without  knowing  what  the 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 29/147 
 
  
 
 
consequences were of their results, it is hard to evaluate the weight of these studies. The only thing that 
can be concluded is that process change and storage conditions may influence the in vivo release profile 
of bupivacaine. Furthermore, the applicant did not define PK parameters which would be desirable for 
this drug product. In some studies, due to difference in applied concentrations of bupivacaine, systemic 
exposure was so low that is questionable if those concentrations would even produce pharmacological 
effects of drug substance. Link between PK parameters and pharmacological effect of bupivacaine is not 
discussed in nonclinical or clinical part of dossier.  
In summary, these non-GLP studies evaluated the plasma bupivacaine PK of different lots of Exparel. It 
was shown that variety of absorption characteristics impact the PK response, including species, dose, 
formulation, route of administration, vascularity of the administration site and other factors at site of 
administration. In addition, process variants and effects of storage and temperature can also change PK 
profile of Exparel. 
AUC  and  Cmax  for  DepoBupivacaine  in  study  RES-0703-D0402-026  is  very  low.  In  addition,  Tmax  for 
DepoBupivacaine  is  very  variable.  Great  interindividual  differences  in  PK  parameters  can  be  seen  for 
Depo formulation. The applicant states that the low AUC is explainable by the fact that it is the first study 
performed by a new preclinical scientist.  
Distribution 
In-depth distribution studies were not performed as part of the nonclinical program for Exparel as the 
distribution  of  bupivacaine  is  considered  well  known  and  as  there  is  long  standing  experience  on  the 
therapeutic use in Europe. Factors that may affect distribution of bupivacaine from the site of injection 
among  other  factors  include  the  dosage  form,  release  rate,  plasma  and  tissue  protein  binding  and 
metabolic activity.  
The only distribution study that was conducted using Exparel was study to determine whether Exparel 
liposomal  particles  are  sequestered  within  the  blood  cell  fraction  from  beagle  dogs  following 
centrifugation. Distribution of Exparel within blood was compared to distribution of IR bupivacaine. There 
was  no  difference  in  the  distribution  of  bupivacaine  in  blood  between  the  dogs  treated  with  Exparel 
comparing to IR bupivacaine. As IR bupivacaine is widely used substance, provided review of relevant 
published references on bupivacaine distribution is considered sufficient to justify distribution of Exparel.   
Metabolism  
Bupivacaine  is  widely  used  substance  with  metabolism  well  documented  in  the  literature.  Applicant 
provided short review on its metabolism citing published literature references enclosed in module 4. No 
metabolism studies are deemed necessary. 
Bupivacaine in other drug products is usually stored below 25°C as a precautionary measure to prevent 
bupivacaine from degradation. The applicant claims that they conducted a thermal degradation study on 
Exparel and bupivacaine phosphate at 40°C for 4 days using the analytical procedure for bupivacaine 
degradation  products.  A  full  report  on  this  study  is  not  included  in  the  applicant’s  response  as  the 
applicant  said  that  it  is  only  being  finalised.  A  table  with  percent  of  impurities  content  in  control  and 
degraded  samples  for Exparel  and  Bupivacaine  phosphate  was  presented.  Impurity  profiles  of  control 
and samples that were placed under thermal stress at 40°C for 4 days were completely the same. Since 
elevated  temperature  (up  to  40°C)  did  not  have  an  effect  on  degradation  of  bupivacaine,  it  could  be 
expected that degradation of bupivacaine inside Depo formulation would not alter when Exparel is applied 
in patient’s body.

Interactions 
PK  data  from  study  S08668  cannot  be  sorted  considering  great  interindividual  differences  in  PK 
parameters or possible PK interactions and no firm conclusion can be drawn from this study S08668. PK 
parameters  are  not  dose  related,  as  it  was  seen  also  in  previous  studies.  PK  interaction  between 
bupivacaine  HCl  and  DepoBupivacaine,  regardless  of  concentration,  ratio  or  time  slot  between  drugs, 
cannot be excluded.  
Maximum  dose  of  bupivacaine  administered  in  different  formulations  was  4-5  mg/kg  in  total  (2+1  or 
4+1). Maximum recommended dose for bupivacaine HCl local infiltration in swine in practice is 5 mg/kg 
(Swindle and Smith, 2016.). This is in contrast with PK studies with other species, where bupivacaine 
was  usually  overdosed.  No  studies  with  Exparel  are  done  with  5  mg/kg  dose  of  single  product 
DepoBupivacaine or bupivacaine HCl in swine, no comparison can be done.  
It was noted in PK studies in dogs that there is a model-dependant PK profile of Exparel (alteration of 
PK parameters when administered into wound). It is reasonable to presume that study S07607 does 
not present a firm evidence of absence of PK interactions since there is a possibility of alteration of PK 
parameters  when  epinephrine  and  lidocaine  are  administered  into  wound.  Discussion  on  results  of 
S07607 study is presented.  This study formed the basis of the recommendation that lidocaine could be 
administered with Exparel after a 20 min delay.  The applicant has removed the statement regarding the 
use of Exparel in conjunction with epinephrine from the proposed SmPC. There is still no dose adjustment 
for lidocaine or Exparel in the proposed SmPC. It can be presumed that the applicant does not consider 
dose adjustments necessary if the 20 minutes period is respected. In the responses to clinical questions, 
a report on serious adverse reactions is presented collected from postmarketing data in countries where 
Exparel is already marketed. It can be seen that a number of adverse effect are caused by concomitant 
use  of  lidocaine,  mostly  due  to  medical  error,  some  attributed  to  lidocaine  and/or  epinephrine,  some 
attributed to Exparel.  
Presented non-clinical PK interaction study S08668 cannot be taken as a firm evidence of absence of PK 
interaction between bupivacaine HCl solution and DepoBupivacaine when premixed in the same syringe. 
No new non-clinical data were submitted. According to the applicant, the Study S08668 conducted in 
pigs had an exploratory objective to evaluate interaction potential when Exparel and IR bupivacaine were 
administered  at  various  ratios  but  not  to  test  the  maximum  doses  of  two  products  that  could  be  co-
administered. In vitro compatibility study by Kharitonov (2014) showed that admixing Exparel and IR 
bupivacaine in ratio 2:1 or higher should not affect release of bupivacaine from the liposomes at room 
temperature. This suggests that no significant interaction is expected for the admixture prepared in the 
syringe. Refer to assessment of clinical issues. 
PK  parameters  following  intravenous  or  subcutaneous  administration  of  Exparel  or  IR  bupivacaine  in 
dogs were compared. Results clearly show desirable prolonged and more uniform PK profile of Exparel. 
Even  though  concentration  of  Exparel  that  was  applied  SC  was  multiple  times  higher,  due  to  slower 
release from liposomes, Cmax in group that it was administered was never as high as Cmax in group 
that had Exparel administered intravenously. Prolonged release could also be seen in significantly longer 
Tmax in the same group. 
Other studies 
The  applicant  states  that  regarding  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  of  the 
phospholipid (DOPC, DEPC, and DPPG) and neutral lipid (cholesterol, triolein, tricaprylin) components of 
the DepoFoam matrix, since these are all naturally occurring or synthetic analogues of common lipids, 
the metabolic fate of these excipients is expected to be similar to that of endogenous lipids. The applicant 
presented  an  overview  of  expected  absorption,  metabolism  and  excretion  of  lipid  components  of 
DepoFoam.  The  metabolism  and  excretion  of  DepoFoam  can  theoretically  be  described  based  on  an 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 31/147 
 
  
 
 
understanding  of  the  biochemistry  of  its  individual  components  but  the  rate  of  absorption  of  lipid 
materials is different from and cannot be compared to simple subcutaneous injection of individual lipid 
components. DepoFoam remains on the site of application for a period longer than 28 days, but not in 
the original form. It is stated that tricaprylin becomes a liquid oil at body temperature leaving particles 
for partition into the surrounding tissues. Particles are then destabilised. If tricaprylin leaves DepoFoam 
shortly  after  administration,  liposomes  reorganise  and  their  further  excretion  is  delayed  but  this 
mechanism  is  not  completely  understood.  It  is  presumed  that  all  individual  components  follow  lipid 
metabolism pathways. 
The study QPS-137N-0401 objective was to determine the tissue distribution of DEPC and DEPC related 
material  following  a  single,  subcutaneous  (SC)  administration  of  a  DepoFoam  formulation  containing 
[14C-labelled DEPC] to male, pigmented rats using quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA). 
The  applicant  states,  that  quantitative  whole-body  autoradiography  was  used  to  evaluate  the  tissue 
distribution of DEPC (and metabolites). There are no data provided regarding metabolites of DEPC. DEPC 
is expected to follow the lipid catabolism pathways similar to a natural fatty acid. As DEPC is a synthetic 
homolog  of  natural  lipid  DOPC,  explanation  for  possible  metabolism  of  DEPC  compared  with  DOPC  is 
acceptable. 
Tissue  distribution  of  DepoFoam-bound  bupivacaine  following  systemic  exposure  (e.g.  following 
absorption  after  local  application  or  following  inadvertent  systemic  iv  or  ia  application)  has  not  been 
evaluated. Although the tissue distribution of DepoFoam-bupivacaine following systemic exposure was 
not formally evaluated, pharmacokinetic evaluations of Exparel following IV or IA administration were 
compared with immediate release (IR) bupivacaine in dogs (Study 504333). Since the pharmacokinetics 
of bupivacaine in Exparel following IV or IA administration in dogs was similar to IR bupivacaine, there 
is likely no significant difference in the tissue distribution of bupivacaine is expected. The distribution of 
bupivacaine is well known as it has been extensively characterised in the scientific literature and there 
is  long  standing  experience  on  the  therapeutic  use  with  approved  bupivacaine  products.  In  addition, 
essentially  little  or  no  liposome-encapsulated  bupivacaine  circulating  in  the  vasculature  after  SC 
administration of Exparel. 
Reproductive toxicity and tissue distribution of DepoFoam bound bupivacaine to foetal tissues following 
systemic exposure (e.g. following absorption after local application or following inadvertent systemic iv 
or ia application) have not been evaluated. Pharmacokinetic evaluations of Exparel following intravenous 
or  intraarterial  administration  were  compared  with  immediate  release  bupivacaine  in  dogs,  which 
demonstrated no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of the two thus suggesting no significant 
differences in their tissue distribution. Based on the obtained data, it is most likely that the reproductive 
toxicity of Exparel is similar or even lower than that of IR bupivacaine due to the lower systemic maximal 
concentrations of bupivacaine when administered in the encapsulated form.  
Toxicology 
Single dose studies 
Exparel, when administered in a single dose SC or as a nerve block to rats, dogs and rabbits, shows a 
very low or no acute toxicity. Nevertheless, it has a local effect on skin and subcutis, which is not seen 
with Bupivacaine HCl. In  all presented studies, various local effects are reported, predominantly local 
(granulomatous)  inflammatory  changes  on  the  injection  sites.  This  is  an  effect  not  seen  with  simple 
bupivacaine HCl solution and it should be attributed to the liposomal particles in the drug product. 
Three studies were performed using SKY Placebo intravenously: two dose-range finding studies and one 
expanded  toxicity  study  of  Placebo  in  rats.  In  the  last  study,  one  animal  died  in  the  1  mL/kg  group, 
immediate  postdose  with  signs  of  salivation,  decreased  activity,  breathing  shallow  and  slow,  black 
material around nose, righting reflex lost. Macroscopically no findings. The cause of death could not be 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 32/147 
 
  
 
 
determined  but  was  considered  test  article-related.  Clinical  observations  occurred  sporadically  and 
isolated or only a few animals with no clear relationship to the test article. These included, among others, 
clinical  symptoms  very  similar  to  those  of  the  animal  died  on  study  with  no  other  macroscopic  and 
microscopic  findings:  salivation,  red  material  around  nose,  rapid  and/or  shallow  breathing,  and 
decreased activity. Even though, symptoms did not occur in one but rather in several animals, assessor 
is of the opinion that the dose level of 0.5 ml/kg cannot be considered a NOEL since symptoms similar 
to those occurred in dead animal in high group, occurred also in lower groups but with no fatalities. In 
tox studies with SKY0402 administered IV and IA, more severe effects were noted with IA administration. 
Within  two of  these  studies  (in  dogs)  a  board-certified  veterinary  cardiologist conducted  a  qualitative 
review of ECGs obtained twice prior to each dose (at least 30 minutes apart) and at immediately post 
dose  (within  2  minutes),  10,  30  and  90  minutes  post  dose  following  the  intravenous  or  intra-arterial 
injection of escalating doses of Exparel or Bupivacaine HCl in dogs. There was no effect of the intravenous 
or  intra-arterial  injection  of  escalating  doses  of  Exparel  or  Bupivacaine  HCI  on  qualitative  ECG 
parameters. In the study 694604 Animal 3501 was not euthanised after having severe clinical signs of 
toxicity after first dose (decreased and increased activity, convulsions, tremors, lying on side, decreased 
muscle  tone,  weak,  pale  skin,  salivation,  respiratory  rate  irregular,  urination  and  defecation  during 
examination) which raises an ethical concern. Animal was dosed three more times. Difference in clinical 
signs after administration of same dose IV Exparel (9 mg/kg) are noted: one animal had to be euthanised 
(no  2502)  due  to  severity  of  symptoms  after  the  first  administration  and  the  other  (2501)  had  only 
moderate symptoms after repeated dose of IV Exparel.  
Number of animals is too small to determine an MTD. Study 694609 is a dose-range finding study limited 
in scale and scope, intended for future dose-selection. Animal, which tolerated 9 mg/kg intravenously, 
received a single dose of 4.5 mg/kg three days before. The applicant argues that this animal is probably 
tolerant  to  bupivacaine,  or  the  dose  is  near  the  limit  of  tolerability.  Interindividual  differences  and 
variability in response is acknowledged.  
Intravenous administration of bupivacaine at 1.5 mg/kg and intra-arterial administration of Exparel at 
3.0 or 4.5 mg/kg resulted in adverse clinical signs including convulsions, lying on side, and decreased 
muscle  tone.  Intravenous  administration  of  bupivacaine  at  0.75  mg/kg,  as  well  as  intravenous 
administration  Exparel  at  1.5  mg/kg  resulted  in  less  severe  clinical  signs  of  emesis,  increased  or 
decreased  activity,  tremors,  and  uncoordination  in  individual  animals.  All  clinical  signs  were  transient 
and  had  no  clinical  or  anatomic  pathology  correlates.  NOEL  for  intra-arterial  administration  of 
bupivacaine  was  considered  to  be  0.1  mg/kg.  No  NOAEL  could  be  determined  for  intra-arterial 
administration of Exparel. In conclusion, Exparel is not to be administered IV or IA since the effect of IV 
and IA administration is not known except that IA administration is potentially fatal when administered 
in sufficient amount into carotid arteries. Exact pathological mechanism is not known since this is not 
discussed; no pathologic correlations are found.  
Administering test product via right carotid artery is not representative of clinical situation. Test product 
administered intra-arterial into carotids is delivered to the head of animals, whereas in clinical setting, if 
the  product  is  to  be  administered  IA  by  mistake,  it  will  most  probably  be  administered  distally,  into 
arteries of limbs or abdomen. It is confirmed that administration of Exparel in carotid arteries is toxic 
and can be lethal. The applicant provided a short overview of two possible scenarios if Exparel is to be 
administered  intravascular,  with  no  distinction  between  intravenous  and  intra-arterial  administration.  
Following  accidental  administration  in  a  peripheral  artery  away  from  the  CNS,  it  is  expected  that  the 
plasma levels and potential untoward effects would be similar to what is seen following comparable doses 
in accidental intra-venous administrations.  
No  relevant  conclusion  can  be  drawn  out  of  intrathecal  and  epidural  studies  at  this  time  point  since 
epidural/intrathecal route is not an expected route of administration in clinical setting.

In the repeat dose toxicity studies with Exparel, the applicant set NOAELs not taking into consideration 
local effects as adverse. SKY0402 does not produce a notable and significant systemic toxicity except in 
rabbits, which are most sensitive of species selected for repeat dose testing and convulsions are seen 
with SKY0402 9 mg/kg similar to IR bupivacaine 9 mg/kg.  
Repeat dose studies 
Significant  findings  in  repeat  dose  studies  are  all  related  to  local  findings:  red  discoloration  and 
swelling/thickening  of  injection  sites,  microscopic  findings  of  haemorrhage  and  neovascularisation, 
minimal to moderate number of vacuolated macrophages, giant cells, granulomatous inflammations in 
the  subcutis  and  mineral  deposits.  The  subcutaneous  granulomatous  inflammation  and  mineralisation 
associated with SKY0402 seen in repeat dose toxicity studies is not considered reversible since it was 
observed in recovery animals, except for the monthly local femoral nerve block.  
The last study (Monthly local femoral nerve block injections, Beagle dogs) has a dosing schedule with 
administrations so infrequent, it can be almost considered a single dose toxicity study, especially since 
the applicant is constantly stating that the drug is cleared by 28 days. Nevertheless, local granulomatous 
inflammation is noted here also. 
SKY0402 Placebo material does not produce systemic toxicity but local reactions are consistently found 
and  they  include:  mild  to  moderate  chronic  panniculitis,  granulomatous  inflammation,  thickening  of 
injection  sites,  accumulations  of  vacuolated  macrophages,  mineralisation,  with  only  oedema  and 
haemorrhage not found in recovery animals.    
The  subcutaneous  granulomatous  inflammation  and  mineralisation  associated  with  SKY0402  seen  in 
repeat dose toxicity studies is not considered reversible since it was observed in recovery animals. The 
applicant presents an overview of all noted granulomatous inflammation processes in non-clinical studies 
and argues these findings likely involve normal lipid clearance processes; it was not considered adverse 
and resolves over time. From the applicant’s presentation of all granulomatous inflammatory changes in 
non-clinical studies, it can be concluded that complete reversal of changes can be expected somewhere 
between  one  and  three  months  after  application.  It  is  not  considered  to  be  a  concern  for  human, 
particularly with an acute exposure regimen. As for the issues related to the observed sex-differences in 
terms of higher chronic inflammation rates in female rats in SC toxicity study, the applicant provides a 
meaningful  clarification  on  the  study  data  interpretation  by  explaining  that  the  size  of  the  measured 
biological effect in females was negligible – i.e., the severity of the inflammation was minimal in most of 
the  cases.  The  applicant  justifies  that  despite  the  observable  difference  between  sexes,  it  is  not 
considered to represent true sex differences but rather biological variation.  
Toxicokinetic 
Toxicokinetic  analysis  was  done  within  several  toxicity  studies.  Since  the  collected  PK  data  is  very 
variable between studies (because of different routes of administration/study designs and doses) and 
individual  animals,  assessor  was  not  able  to  make  a  single  table  with  all  TK  values.  It  has  to  be 
emphasised that drawing statistical analysis for this kind of messy data in small groups of animals is 
highly questionable. This is also in line with ICH S3A Guideline – Note for Guidance on Toxicokinetics: 
the assessment of systemic exposure in toxicity studies: in some cases, the data of individual animals 
may be more important than a refined statistical analysis of group data. 
Also, it was not possible to make an interspecies comparison and comparison with doses in humans since 
a too variable range of doses are used in clinical setting (see clinical PK AR) and in non-clinical studies. 
In MPI-947-030 study, Tmax ranges from 1 to 48 hours. Systemic exposure is lower when rabbits are 
given higher dose of bupivacaine encapsulated in liposomes in comparison to IR bupivacaine. This is a 
desirable profile for a depo product, but a very variable Tmax can be seen and Cmax was notably higher 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 34/147 
 
  
 
 
in one animal receiving SKY0402 – animal no 172, a female, had a 10 times higher exposure at Tmax 
compared to other 3 animals in the same group. Considering small groups of animals, this effect has to 
be noted and taken as a possibility of sudden disruption of liposomes and release of higher amount of 
bupivacaine in bloodstream.  
Cmax seems to be higher after field block than after nerve block in rabbits. In addition, Tmax is somewhat 
lower in field block group, meaning bupivacaine is absorbed faster and in higher quantities in field block 
than in nerve block site. 
In the MPI-947-029 study, systemic exposure is generally lower when dogs are given bupivacaine in the 
same  or  higher  dose,  encapsulated  as  SKY0402,  in  comparison  to  IR  bupivacaine.  This  is  a  desirable 
effect for a depo product. High interindividual differences are noted again. Animal no. 111 had a similar 
Cmax with the same dose of IR bupivacaine and Depo Bupivacaine (1450 ng/mL IR bupi; 1230 ng/mL 
SKY0402) and substantially higher AUC 0-96h exposure in comparison with IR bupivacaine and similar 
AUC 0-96h to high dose SKY0402 group (21800 ng·hr/ml). Animal no. 151 had ten times higher Cmax 
compared to other animals in the same group. Same effect is seen in animal no. 160. While in animal 
no 172 a very low Cmax is seen compared to other animals in the same group.  
AUC0-96h in Exparel group after peripheral nerve block ranges from 13600 to 30400 ng·hr/ml and 12700 
to  42800  ng·hr/ml  respectively.  Tmax  is  lower  after  SC  infiltration.  Cmax  and  AUC  are  higher  after 
peripheral nerve block. Meaning that after SC infiltration a high initial peak of bupivacaine in blood can 
be expected with subsequent slower release and lower blood concentration.  
In  the  study  MPI-947-036  (twice  weekly  dosing  SC  in  rabbits)  TK  data  suggests  that  each  dose  of 
SKY0402 was not cleared completely before the next dose was administered. There is noted different 
susceptibility to bupivacaine in rabbits, including higher sensitivity to toxic effects. 
In the study MPI-947-037 (twice weekly dosing SC in dogs) TK data suggests that each dose was cleared 
almost completely before the next dose was administered. There is no cumulative toxicity reported in 
repeat dose toxicity study dogs. 
Genotoxicity 
According to presented literature, bupivacaine is not genotoxic but a potential metabolite of bupivacaine, 
2,6-xylidine, is a weak mutagenic agent in vitro and has genotoxic characteristics in vivo under certain 
conditions. This issue is addressed in the impurities part of AR as 2,6 xylidine is also an impurity in this 
drug product. SKY0402 Placebo did not show genotoxic potential in performed studies. Exposure in the 
in vivo test is considered adequate. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity  
From the standard battery of reproductive and developmental studies performed with placebo, it can be 
concluded that SKY0402 Placebo does not have an effect on reproduction and development. 
Local tolerance  
Study RES-0702-D0402-044: Incidence of local tissue reactions on the site of administration is greater 
in DepoBupivacaine and Placebo groups. A single SC injection of DepoBupivacaine at concentrations up 
to 25 mg/kg was well tolerated systemically, but was associated with histopathological changes at the 
injection site, typical of foreign body reactions. Necropsies were done 13 days post dosing. 
Study MPI 947-004:  All changes directly associated with the skin incision and foreign material (hair, 
staples): discoloration of the injection site, mild to moderate inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia and 
fibroplasia. No effects observed at the intra-articular and femoral nerve sites. No major group differences 
that would indicate local toxicity of DepoBupivacaine in all three injection sites.  
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 35/147 
 
  
 
 
It is noted that there was only one incision site per one rabbit, meaning no control was used for incision 
site leading to the fact that only 4 rabbits received SKY0402 into a 2.54 cm long incision site. This is a 
quite small number meaning there is a possibility that SKY0402 related effects could not be grasped with 
study  design  of  4/4  rabbits  receiving  SKY0402/bupivacaine  HCl.  Also,  other  dosing  sites  were  not 
subjected  to  surgery  prior  to  administration  which  is  not  a  representative  clinical  situation  where  an 
incision is done through various tissues. 
Dose  levels  recommended  for  rabbits  are  obviously  exceeded  per  one  dose  site  and  extremely  in  all 
dosing sites together, which is also the reason for the death of two animals in the second group. Since 
this is a “stand alone” local tolerance study, the actual concentration of active substance to be used in 
humans should have been tested, not the toxic doses. In addition, testing in different sites on the same 
animal is permissible if the systemic tolerance permits, which is not the case in this study.  
Animal  welfare  should  be  one  of  the  highest  priorities  when  investigating  local  tolerance 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/2145/2000 Rev. 1, Corr. 1*) and this study raises an ethical concern. The applicant 
states  that  mortality  in  this  study  was  unfortunate,  unexpected  and  believed  to  be  due  to  an 
accumulation  of  exposure  from  all  three  administration  sites.  It  is  emphasised  that  the  study  was 
conducted in 2002. While the recent guidance for local tolerance studies is published in 2016.  
Study  MPI  947-013:  Total  bupivacaine  dog  dose  was  reasonably  administered  and  not  overdosed. 
Femoral nerve area and intra-articular injection were administered without previous surgical procedure. 
No effect on femoral nerve and stifle joint were noted and no differences were noted between groups. It 
has to be emphasised that this is not a completely representative clinical situation where intra-articular 
and nerve block will be administered during procedures, which involve incisions through various tissues. 
Animal 211 is the only animal with findings in the intra-articular site and the one of two animals with 
severe oedema on incision sites treated with placebo. Animal 208 pulled out staples from the wound. 
Severe oedema was also found in this animal’s placebo treated wound.  
In  the  single  dose  toxicity  studies  in  all  presented  studies,  various  local  effects  are  reported, 
predominantly local (granulomatous) inflammatory changes on the injection sites. This is an effect not 
seen with simple bupivacaine HCl solution and it should be attributed to the liposomal particles in the 
drug product. 
In the repeat dose toxicity studies significant findings are all related to local findings: red discoloration 
and swelling/thickening of injection sites, microscopic findings of haemorrhage and neovascularisation, 
minimal to moderate number of vacuolated macrophages, giant cells, granulomatous inflammations in 
the  subcutis  and  mineral  deposits.  The  subcutaneous  granulomatous  inflammation  and  mineralisation 
associated with SKY0402 seen in repeat dose toxicity studies is not considered reversible since it was 
observed in recovery animals, except for the monthly local femoral nerve block. 
In the repeat dose toxicity study with SKY0402 Placebo material does not produce systemic toxicity but 
local  reactions  are  consistently  found  and  they  include:  mild  to  moderate  chronic  panniculitis, 
granulomatous  inflammation,  thickening  of injection  sites,  accumulations of  vacuolated  macrophages, 
mineralisation, with only oedema and haemorrhage not found in recovery animals.   
Overall,  findings  on  incision  wound  sites  in  local  tolerance  studies,  findings  from  single  dose  toxicity 
studies  of  SKY0402,  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  with  SKY0402  and  SKY0402  Placebo  material  is 
indicative  of  local  irritative  potential  of  liposomal  particles  to  subcutaneous  tissue.  Even  with  single 
application but especially with repeat/prolonged exposure, presence of exogenous lipids seems to be a 
nidus for the development of foreign body type of reaction in surrounding tissues which is not reversible 
even after a period of one month. It seems possible that prolonged or repeated application of Exparel 
could cause dystrophic changes at the injection site.

2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical dossier is sufficient to support the Marketing Authorisation application for Exparel.  
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The applicant provided efficacy results from the 6 Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, dose 
finding/ranging studies and 11 Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, multicentre studies which are grouped 
by the intended effect of Exparel to produce local analgesia or regional analgesia: 
• 
Local  analgesia  (field  block)  studies:  201  and  207  (hernia  repair);  209,  312,  and  316 
(haemorrhoidectomy);  208,  311,  and  331  (TKA);  317  (bunionectomy);  210  (breast 
augmentation); 329 (third molar extraction); and 411 (caesarean section). 
•  Regional analgesia (peripheral nerve block) studies: 203 (bunionectomy); 323 and 326 (TKA); 
327 (TSA/RCR); and 322 (thoracotomy). 
Local  analgesia  studies  where  Exparel  was  administered  as  a  field  block  are  summarised  in  Table  2. 
There were five Phase 2 studies and seven Phase 3 studies. The Phase 2 studies evaluated Exparel doses 
ranging from 66 mg to 532 mg and were used to inform dosing for the Phase 3 studies. The Phase 3 
studies assessed the efficacy and safety of Exparel doses ranging from 106 mg to 532 mg.

Regional analgesia studies where Exparel was administered as a peripheral nerve block are summarised 
in Table 3. There were two Phase 2 studies and four Phase 3 studies. The Phase 2 studies evaluated 
Exparel doses ranging from 67 mg to 310 mg and were used to inform the dosing for the Phase 3 studies. 
The Phase 3 studies assessed the efficacy and safety of Exparel 133- and 266-mg doses.

A rationale regarding selection of the surgical procedures has been provided. According to the applicant 
the  surgical  procedures  selected  for  the  clinical  studies  are  representative  of  surgeries  that  would  be 
expected  to  lead  to  moderate-to-severe  pain  of  sufficient  duration  to  benefit  from  a  long  acting  local 
anaesthetic  and  where  sustained  management  of  acute  pain  is  traditionally  managed  with  a  CPNB  or 
opioids.  The  surgical  procedures  included  models  of  both  somatic  pain  (e.g.,  third  molar  extraction, 
bunionectomy,  major  orthopaedic  surgery)  as  well  as  models  of  mixed  somatic/visceral  pain  (e.g., 
abdominal/thoracic surgery). 
Different doses were evaluated and compared with saline placebo and IR bupivacaine (as standard of 
care). 
Of note, early in the development program, the bupivacaine dose delivered by Exparel is expressed as 
bupivacaine HCl equivalents. However, after 2011, at US FDA’s request, the bupivacaine dose delivered 
by Exparel is expressed as bupivacaine free base equivalents. The conversion factor from bupivacaine 
HCl equivalents to bupivacaine free base equivalents is as follows: 
0.886 mg bupivacaine free base = 1.0 mg bupivacaine HCl equivalent.

2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Exparel is bupivacaine, an amide-type local anaesthetic, which 
is commercially available as immediate-release (IR) bupivacaine and has been marketed in Europe and 
worldwide for more than 50 years. 
Exparel  is  bupivacaine  encapsulated  in  the  DepoFoam®  drug  delivery  system.  The  prolonged  release 
allows reduced peak plasma concentrations. Once released from the liposomes, bupivacaine absorption 
and disposition is expected to be the same as for other bupivacaine hydrochloride solution formulations. 
Published literature was used to support bupivacaine disposition and drug interactions. 
Clinical pharmacokinetic data were obtained in target patient population in ten clinical studies (4 Phase 
2 and 6 Phase 3). Five studies were conducted to support the clinical pharmacology of Exparel as a field 
block  to  produce  local  analgesia  and  five  other  studies  were  conducted  to  support  the  clinical 
pharmacology  of  Exparel  as  a  peripheral  nerve  block  to  produce  regional  analgesia.  Exparel  doses 
evaluated in these studies ranged from 67 mg to 532 mg of bupivacaine. Additionally, several healthy 
volunteer studies were conducted where Exparel was administered mainly subcutaneously. 
Full PK profiling was performed in all PK studies. Two population PK analyses were conducted, one to 
describe pharmacokinetics of Exparel in the field block and the other in the peripheral nerve block setting.

Absorption 
The systemic absorption of Exparel depends primarily on the rate at which bupivacaine is released from 
the liposome particles, which was designed to take place gradually over an extended time period. Several 
PK studies comparing Exparel with bupivacaine HCl were conducted. In general, lower Cmax values and 
longer measurable plasma concentrations of Exparel compared to bupivacaine HCl were shown (studies 
201 (hernia repair), 203 (bunionectomy) and 002 (ankle nerve block, HV)).  
PK was also evaluated in a range of different surgical models covering both field block and nerve block 
administration at sites of different vascularity. 
Descriptive statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters of representative Exparel doses in field block and 
peripheral nerve block are provided in the tables below. 
Table 5: Summary of PK parameters for bupivacaine after administration of single dose of 
Exparel via field block 
Table 6: Summary of PK parameters for bupivacaine after administration of single dose of 
Exparel via peripheral nerve block 
Overall,  while  the  PK  profiles  of  bupivacaine  released  from  Exparel  vary  between  the  two  routes  of 
administration at the maximum proposed dose of 266 mg, a consistent extended PK profile was observed 
in  both  proposed  routes  of  administration.  Regardless  of  the  surgical  procedure,  each  route  of 
administration presents a distinct shape for the PK curve that is unique to each route. Differences in the 
PK profile amongst various surgical procedure within each route of administration are related to various 
factors, such as vascularity of the site of administration (see figures below).

Figure 5 
Overall, the PK studies demonstrated that administration of Exparel results in systemic plasma levels of 
bupivacaine which can persist for 96 hours after local infiltration and for 120 hours after nerve block.  
The  rate  of  systemic  absorption  of  bupivacaine  is  dependent  upon  the  total  dose  of  medicine 
administered, the route of administration, and the vascularity of the administration site. 
Distribution 
Once  released  from  the  multivesicular  liposomes  that  comprise  Exparel,  bupivacaine  distribution  is 
expected to be the same as for any immediate release bupivacaine HCl formulation.  
The  applicant  provided  an  extensive  literature  review  and  relied  upon  the  product  information  from 
Marcaine.  
Bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly 
perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain.  
The  rate  and  degree  of  diffusion  is  governed  by  the  degree  of  plasma  protein  binding,  the  degree  of 
ionisation, and the degree of lipid solubility.  
Bupivacaine has a high protein binding capacity (95%) predominantly to α1-acid glycoprotein and also 
albumin at higher concentrations. The plasma protein binding of bupivacaine is concentration-dependent. 
As the concentrations of free drug in plasma or serum increases, the percentage of drug that is bound 
to plasma proteins decreases until an equilibrium is reached between bound and unbound drug. A hepatic 
extraction  ratio  of  0.37  has  been  reported  for  bupivacaine  in  the  literature  after  IV  administration.  A 
volume of distribution at steady state of 73l has been reported for bupivacaine. 
Elimination 
The  applicant  provided  an  extensive  literature  review  and  relied  upon  the  product  information  from 
Marcaine. 
• 
Excretion 
Bupivacaine is extensively metabolised as evidenced by the minimal amount of parent drug in the urine. 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 47/147 
 
  
 
 
 
 
• 
Metabolism 
Metabolic clearance by the liver is the predominant route for plasma removal of bupivacaine.  
Bupivacaine, like other amide-type local anaesthetics, is metabolised primarily in the liver via conjugation 
with  glucuronic  acid  with  approximately  5%  converted  to  pipecolylxylidine  (PPX).  The  primary  liver 
enzyme in formation of PPX was shown to be CYP3A4 using liver microsomes, although CYP2C19 and 
CYP2D6 may play a minor role (Gantenbein et al, 2000). 
The major metabolites detected in the urine after dosing with a rac-bupivacaine were, in the order of 
decreasing  concentration,  levo  and  dextro  enantiomers  of  PPX,  4'-hydroxybupivacaine,  and  3'-
hydroxybupivacaine.  
A large fraction of the hydroxylated metabolites of bupivacaine are excreted as glucuronide conjugates 
in the urine. 
The lipid components of Exparel (ie, phospholipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides) are naturally occurring 
or close analogues of endogenous lipids, and thus are metabolised like naturally occurring lipids. 
• 
Dose proportionality 
Dose proportionality was assessed from the PK data obtained in dose-escalation studies with different 
surgical procedures, including both local infiltration and peripheral nerve block administration (201, 208, 
002, 203 and 323). Dose range investigated in those studies was 67 to 532 mg Exparel. 
With  Exparel  single  dose  administration,  bupivacaine  Cmax  and  AUC  rose  in  an  apparent  dose 
proportional manner through all studies.  
• 
Time dependency 
Time-dependency was not formally assessed as Exparel is intended for single administration.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Population PK analyses showed moderate to high interindividual variability (IIV) for the combined data 
of patients for the volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc/F) (47.4% and 47.8%), and 
for the clearance (CL/F) (43.1% and 31.1%).  
Very high between-subject variability in Cmax and Tmax was observed across field block and peripheral 
nerve block studies, 31.4% to 105.8% and 77% to 217.4%, respectively. High IIV for the absorption 
parameters was also confirmed in the nerve block population analysis. 
No intra-individual variability was estimated since Exparel is intended for single administration. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Pharmacokinetic analyses of individual studies provided useful information to understand the specific PK 
profile of Exparel in various surgical models. Additionally, two population PK models have been developed 
to characterise the PK of Exparel when administered as a field block and as a peripheral nerve block.  
Special Populations 
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
The effect of renal impairment was investigated in the nerve block population PK analysis using EGFR as 
a covariate on CL/F. Renal function was measured in 3 studies (203, 326 and 327). No significant effect 
was identified. Categories of renal impairment were also evaluated graphically by diagnostic plots. No 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 48/147 
 
  
 
 
effects  of  mild  (n=201)  and  moderate  (n=17)  renal  impairment  were  seen  on  the  random  effects  on 
apparent clearance.  
Consistent with expectations (since only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine), mild 
and  moderate  renal  impairment did not  influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of  bupivacaine.  There  was  no 
data in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Renal elimination plays only a minor role in excretion of bupivacaine. However, bupivacaine metabolites 
are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in 
patients  with  impaired  renal  function.  Impaired  renal  function  should  be  considered  when  performing 
dose selection of Exparel.  
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
A dedicated hepatic impairment study was performed and hepatic function was assessed as a covariate 
in the population PK analysis. 
Study 110 was conducted to study Exparel 266 mg via subcutaneous injection in a reduced study design 
comparing  only  moderate  hepatic  impairment  group  to  age-,  gender-,  and  weight-matched  control 
subjects with normal hepatic function.  
The results showed that exposure to total bupivacaine was approximately 50% higher in the moderate 
impairment group [GMR (90%CI) for Cmax 1.48 (1.12, 1.96), AUC0-last 1.72 (1.34, 2.20) and AUC0-∞
1.73 (1.36, 2.22)]. The exposure to bupivacaine metabolite PPX increased approximately 2-fold [GMR 
(90% CI) for Cmax 2.00 (1.19, 3.35), AUC0-last 2.55 (1.46, 4.47) and AUC0-∞ 1.61 (1.01, 2.58)]. The 
mean  (SD)  total  body  clearance  of  bupivacaine  was  16.95  (2.20)  L/hour  in  subjects  with  moderate 
hepatic  impairment  compared  with  31.21  (11.52)  L/hour  in  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function,  a 
reduction  of  approximately  46%.  The  effect  of  moderate  hepatic  impairment  on  changes  in  protein 
binding was shown through unbound/total ratios for bupivacaine (1.8% vs 2.7%) and PPX (50.5% vs 
64.8%) that were both higher for moderate impairment group compared to control group. The popPK 
model indicated the lack of effect of mild impairment on Exparel PK.  
There was no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. However, 
the  product  should  be  used  cautiously  in  patients  with  hepatic  disease  as  indicated  in  the  proposed 
labelling. 
• 
Other intrinsic factors  
The effect of sex, race, weight and age was investigated in the population PK analysis (nerve block popPK 
model). Black race did not influence PK of bupivacaine. Age and sex influenced magnitude of the Late 
Cmax, and body weight and BMI influenced values of the Early Cmax according to the simulations. The 
magnitude of the observed differences was not considered clinically meaningful. 
Interactions 
No human drug interaction studies were performed. The applicant relied upon the published literature 
which was supplemented with several in vitro compatibility studies performed with Exparel, as well as 
two in vivo studies having Exparel admixed with immediate release bupivacaine HCl solution. 
Using  Exparel  followed  by  other  bupivacaine  formulations  has  not  been  studied  in  clinical  trials.  The 
addition of local anaesthetics administered within 96 hours following administration of Exparel should 
take into account the total bupivacaine exposure. 
Some physicochemical incompatibilities exist between Exparel and certain other drugs. Direct contact of 
Exparel with these drugs results in a rapid increase in free (unencapsulated) bupivacaine, altering Exparel 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 49/147 
 
  
 
 
characteristics and potentially affecting the safety and efficacy of Exparel. Therefore, admixing Exparel 
with other drugs prior to administration is not recommended. 
The administration of Exparel may follow the administration of lidocaine after a delay of 20 minutes or 
more. 
Bupivacaine  HCl  administered  together  with  Exparel  may  impact  the  PK  and/or  physicochemical 
properties of Exparel, and this effect is concentration dependent. Therefore, bupivacaine HCl and Exparel 
may  be  administered  simultaneously  in  the  same  syringe,  and  bupivacaine  HCl  may  be  injected 
immediately  before  Exparel  as  long  as  the  ratio  of  the  milligram  dose  of  bupivacaine  HCl  solution  to 
Exparel does not exceed 1:2. 
The  toxic  effects  of  these  drugs  are  additive,  and  their  administration  should  be  used  with  caution 
including monitoring for neurologic and CV effects related to local anaesthetic systemic toxicity. 
When a topical antiseptic such as povidone iodine is applied, the site should be allowed to dry before 
Exparel is administered into the site. Exparel should not be allowed to come into contact with antiseptics 
such as povidone iodine in solution. 
Patients  that  are  administered  local  anaesthetics  may  be  at  increased  risk  of  developing 
methaemoglobinaemia when concurrently exposed to the oxidizing medicinal products. 
Studies  conducted  with  Exparel  demonstrated  that  the  most  common  implantable  materials 
(polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, silicone, stainless steel, and titanium) are not affected by the 
presence of Exparel any more than they are by saline. None of the materials studied had an adverse 
effect on Exparel. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The  most  important  PK  consideration  for  a  local  anaesthetic  is  systemic  toxicity.  Systemic  toxicity  is 
associated with both the rate of rise in plasma concentration as well as the Cmax level that is achieved. 
Bupivacaine levels that have been associated with CNS (>2000 ng/mL) and CV (>4000 ng/mL) toxicity 
have been previously reported (Tucker 1986; Knudsen 1997; Jorfeldt 1968; Bardsley 1998). In order to 
avoid systemic toxicity, the maximum recommended dose of bupivacaine HCl is 150-175 mg in single 
administration with a maximum total of 400 mg within a 24-hour period (e.g., by continuous infusion or 
repeat administration) (Marcain SmPC). 
Comparative PK studies consistently demonstrated that systemic bupivacaine concentrations following 
Exparel  administration  were  lower  than  equivalent  doses  of  IR  bupivacaine.  Even  in  cases  when  the 
Exparel dose was higher than IR bupivacaine, the maximum bupivacaine concentrations observed with 
Exparel (i.e., highest outlying values) were 0.9- to 3.5-fold lower than IR bupivacaine with consistently 
lower mean Cmax values reached at later times (i.e., Tmax) due to the extended release of bupivacaine 
from Exparel. 
The  Cmax  above  the  safety  threshold  of  2000  ng/mL  was  reached  in  only  one  patient  in  the  clinical 
development  program,  it  was  considered  that  this  exemption  is  due  to  inadvertent  intravascular 
administration.  
Thus, clinicians should select the dose of Exparel that is appropriate for the analgesic need for a specific 
patient, as long as the selected dose is within the maximum recommended dose of 266 mg. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics  
The pharmacology of bupivacaine has been extensively characterised in the scientific literature and it 
has been an approved local anaesthetic for several decades. 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 50/147 
 
  
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Local  anaesthetics  are  used  to  achieve  blockage  of  propagation  of  pain  signals  along  nerve  fibres  by 
preventing the inward movement of sodium ions through the cell membranes of nerve fibres. 
Local anaesthetics block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing 
the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, but slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and 
by  reducing  the  rate  of  rise  in  the  action  potential.  The  applicant  states  that  the  progression  of 
anaesthesia  is  related  to  the  diameter,  myelination,  and  conduction  velocity  of  affected  nerve  fibres. 
Clinically,  the  order  of  loss  of  nerve  function  is  as  follows:  (1)  pain,  (2)  temperature,  (3)  touch,  (4) 
proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
The primary efficacy endpoint for most of the Phase 3 studies was the cumulative pain intensity for a 
pre-specified duration as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). 
The use of cumulative pain intensity scores as a primary efficacy endpoint was considered appropriate 
since the treatment goal with local anaesthetics is the prevention of moderate-to-severe pain. 
Subjective pain assessments were collected using at least one of several validated measures: numeric 
rating scale at rest (NRS-R), numeric rating scale with activity (NRS-A), or visual analogue scale (VAS). 
(Note:  not  all  measures  were  collected  in  every  study.)  For  each  endpoint,  AUC  was  measured  for  a 
duration of effect appropriate to the surgical model under investigation. 
Local anaesthetics provide their analgesic effects by depolarizing nerve fibres at the site of surgery or 
injury. However, the serum levels of local anaesthetics do assist in assessing the risk for the potential 
for systemic side effects such as central nervous system (CNS) or cardiovascular (CV) toxicity. 
Integrated Cardiac Safety Report 
Integrated  Cardiac  Safety  Report  was  done  by  applicant  to  evaluate  possible  association  between 
bupivacaine use and cardiovascular changes. 
Integrated  Summary  of  Safety  (ISS)  for  cardiac  safety  and  details  the  preclinical  cardiac  safety  data 
followed by the definitive ICH E14 Thorough QT/QTc Study data that provide the most reliable method 
of  determining  the  effect  of  Exparel  on  cardiac  safety  as  defined  by  the  changes  observed  in  the 
electrocardiogram (ECG). 
The  applicant  has  included  ECGs  as  part  of  the  safety  measurements  employed  to  determine  cardiac 
safety of Exparel in the seven clinical studies of the development program, corresponding clinical studies 
are summarised in Table 3.3.2 - 3

Study 
Description 
SKY0402-002 
A Phase 1 study conducted in Edinburgh in 2004 in healthy volunteers which used 
dose escalation in 36 male subjects treated in four cohorts. No specific ECG data 
was obtained; ECG results of normal or abnormal were obtained predose, followed 
by  continuing  cardiac  monitoring.  All  results  from  continuous  monitoring  after 
study  drug  administration  were  reported  as  normal  for  all  subjects;  no  cardiac 
effects were commented upon. 
SKY0402-021 
A Phase 1 study conducted in Riccarton, Scotland in 2001 (entitled as study 019) 
in  healthy  volunteers  using  10  and  50  mg  SC  injection  of  SKY0402  versus 
bupivacaine and placebo in nine male subjects in two stages. A screening 12-lead 
ECG was obtained and then after the injection of study drug a 6-hour single lead 
ECG was obtained. The study report does not note any ECG findings or cardiac 
events. 
SKY0402-C-103 
A Phase 1, randomised, double-blind, dose-finding study to evaluate the safety, 
PK, and pharmacodynamic profiles of SKY0402 administered via a single epidural 
injection  to  healthy  volunteers.  The  study  was  conducted  in  Australia  in  2005-
2006. The objective of this study was to evaluate the epidural administration of 
SKY0402  with  regard  to  safety,  PK  profile,  and  pharmacodynamic  effects 
(presence, depth, extent, and duration of motor and sensory block). 
The study attempted to determine the dose (or dose range) of SKY0402 that may 
be safely administered to achieve a clinically optimal combination of sensory and 
motor block. 
SKY0402-C-110 
An  Open-Label,  Phase  1  Study  to  Assess  the  Pharmacokinetics  and  Safety  of 
SKY0402 in Subjects with Impaired Hepatic Function, was conducted in Poland in 
2009. 
SKY0402-C-201 
A  Phase  2  dose-escalation  study  evaluating  the  safety,  efficacy,  and 
pharmacokinetics of SKY0402 administered by local infiltration for postoperative 
pain management in subjects undergoing inguinal hernia repair. 
SKY0402-C-203 
A Phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, dose-escalating/de-escalating 
study  to  evaluate  the  safety,  efficacy,  and  pharmacokinetics  of  SKY0402 
administered  as  a  nerve  block  in  the  management  of  postoperative  pain  in 
subjects undergoing bunionectomy. This study was conducted in 2005-2006 in 15 
sites in Europe and Australia. 
SKY0402-C-208 
A  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  active-control,  dose-
ranging  study  to  evaluate  the  safety,  efficacy,  and  comparative  systemic 
bioavailability  of  a  single  administration  of  SKY0402  via  local  infiltration  for 
prolonged postoperative analgesia in subjects undergoing total knee arthroplasty 
(TKA). 
The  applicant,  in  recognition  of  the  incompletely  characterised  relationship  of  bupivacaine  use  and 
cardiac effects, has conducted a complete development programme which included an ICH E14 compliant 
ECG trial and a total of 21 clinical trials (including 16 subjects who, after local administration into the 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 52/147 
 
  
 
 
 
surgical wound, reached a bupivacaine plasma Cmax >1 mg/L). In this programme, no cardiac signal of 
any kind has been detected. 
Thorough QT/QTc Studies 
The effect of Exparel on ECG parameters has been evaluated in two QT studies (Study 105 and Study 
107)  in  healthy  volunteers  at  supra-therapeutic  doses  as  well  as  with  ECG  monitoring  in  all  Exparel 
clinical  studies.  Based  on  applicant  conclusions  these  two  studies  found  that  therapeutic  and  supra-
therapeutic doses of Exparel did not have a clinically meaningful impact on cardiac repolarisation. The 
effect of Exparel on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters has been evaluated in these two thorough QT 
studies evaluating supra-therapeutic doses of Exparel (300 mg up to 750 mg) administered to healthy 
volunteers. 
Study SKY0402-C-105 was a single centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and positive controlled, 
five-way, crossover study conducted in 49 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of two dose levels 
of SKY0402 (300 mg and 450 mg) on the corrected QT interval, which was extended in Study SKY0402-
C-107 to evaluate an additional two higher doses (600 mg and 750 mg) in 16 of the same subjects to 
be certain that an adequate supra-therapeutic dose was studied. The 600 mg subcutaneous dose and 
especially  the  750  mg  subcutaneous  does  of  SKY0402  administered  in  Study  SKY0402-C-107  were 
selected in order to approximate the plasma levels normally seen in postoperative patients, thus allowing 
an assessment of the effect of these plasma levels on QTc. The 750 mg dose required multiple injections, 
and  the  Independent  Ethics  Committee  commented  on  the  “enormous”  volume;  therefore,  this  was 
considered the highest volume feasible. 
Secondary objectives in Study 105 were to compare the effects of both dose levels of Exparel (266 mg 
subcutaneous and 399 mg subcutaneous) to placebo at each assessment time point on uncorrected QT 
and on QTc to describe categorical QT/QTc interval data and qualitative and quantitative ECG variations 
from baseline, to describe and compare them number and rates of AEs under each treatment, and to 
compare moxifloxacin 400 mg (single dose) to placebo on the largest time-matched mean QTc variation 
from baseline.  
Study  107  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  a  single  doses  of  Exparel  (532  mg  and  665  mg, 
subcutaneous) to placebo on the largest time-matched mean QTc variation from baseline. 
Subjects in Study 107 were required to have completed Study 105. The results of the QTc analysis from 
Study  105  showed  that  Exparel  did  not  have  an  effect  on  cardiac  repolarisation.  The  largest  time-
matched mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using individual correction (QTcI) difference between 
Exparel 399 mg and placebo was -2.45 ms with a 90% confidence interval between -3.92 and -0.97 ms 
therefore indicating no QTc prolonging effect. 
The results of the QTc analysis from Study 107 showed that a single supratherapeutic dose of Exparel 
does not have an effect on cardiac repolarisation. The categorical analyses have shown that no subjects 
on  Exparel  665  mg  or  Exparel  532  mg  had increases  from  baseline  in  QTcI which  were  >60  msec  or 
absolute QTcI values >500 msec.  
The applicant has concluded, that the findings of this study and a previous study (105) demonstrate that 
a single dose of Exparel at 266 mg, 399 mg, 532 mg, or 665 mg does not prolong the QTc interval. 
Combined Pool 
The percentage of subjects with a post-treatment ECG interpreted as clinically significant abnormal was 
3.5% in the All Exparel group, 3.9% in the IR bupivacaine group, and 0% in the placebo group in the 
Combined Pool.

Table 8: Summary of ECG Findings by Time Point Combined Local and Regional Analgesia 
Pool 
Study 323 collected normal or abnormal (no further interpretation regarding clinical significance); the 
percentage of subjects with a post-treatment ECG interpreted as abnormal was 32.7% in the All Exparel 
and placebo groups. 
Additionally,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  a  normal  ECG  at  baseline  and  an  abnormal  ECG  post-
treatment  (either  not  clinically  significant  or  PCS)  was  similar  among  the  treatment  groups  and  no 
relationship with Exparel dose was observed. 
Electrocardiogram and Holter Results from Studies 322 and 323 
Holter  recordings  were  collected  in  Studies  322  and  323,  and  these  recordings  have  undergone 
substantial  additional  review  and  analyses.  The  applicant  has  concluded  that  there  were  no  clinically 
relevant imbalances between the active study drug (liposome bupivacaine) and placebo for heart rate 
range, supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias or bradycardic arrhythmias including sinus pauses >3 
sec; AV block, or mean low heart rate. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions  
Exparel should be used with caution in patients receiving other local anaesthetics or active substances 
structurally  related  to  amide-type  local  anaesthetics,  e.g.,  certain  anti-arrhythmics,  such  as  lidocaine 
and mexiletine, since the systemic toxic effects are additive. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exparel  provides  a  prolonged  duration  of  systemic  bupivacaine  levels  compared  with  IR  bupivacaine 
when administered as either a field block or a peripheral nerve block, indicating that Exparel is serving 
as a source of locally released bupivacaine over an extended time period.  
The time period associated with systemic bupivacaine release from Exparel generally correlates with the 
prolonged duration of analgesic effect as illustrated by reductions in both pain intensity scores and use 
of opioid rescue medications for up to 72 hours.  
The bupivacaine maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) observed following administration of Exparel 
are lower than equivalent or even higher doses of IR bupivacaine, which may provide an enhanced safety 
margin against systemic toxicity. 
Bupivacaine as local anaesthetic impart its analgesic effects by depolarizing nerve fibres at the site of 
surgery or injury. The plasma levels of local anaesthetics are not associated with primary pharmacologic

effect but are related to the risk for the potential systemic side effects such as central nervous system 
(CNS) or cardiovascular (CV) toxicity. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Population PK analyses 
Two  population  PK  analyses  (one  in  field  block  and  the  other  in  peripheral  nerve  block  setting)  were 
conducted. 
The population PK report provided for the field block setting was not sufficiently detailed to allow full 
assessment of the model in its objective of predicting PK in this setting. A full pop PK report was provided 
in the responses. 
Standard methodology was used for model development and model evaluation. Based on the parameter 
estimates precision, diagnostic plots and visual predictive checks, the final models adequately described 
Exparel PK in field block and nerve block administration.  
Several other concerns raised regarding presentation of pcVPCs, development of the covariate model, 
impact  of  shrinkage  and  simulations  performed  in  the  nerve  block  pop  PK  model  were  adequately 
resolved. 
The purpose of popPK models was to predict bupivacaine PK for a variety of surgical procedures where 
Exparel  is  administered  as  a  field  block  or  nerve  block,  to  estimate  inter-individual  variability  and 
covariate effects. The model is used for informing the SmPC content on special populations. Overall, the 
models are considered to be of low regulatory impact.   
Absorption 
Across the comparative PK studies, half-life of bupivacaine in Exparel dose groups was longer than that 
of bupivacaine HCl. This is expected for extended-release formulations such as liposomal systems. 
In  several  studies  Exparel  exhibited  two  concentration  peaks:  an  early  peak  (associated  with  extra-
liposomal bupivacaine) and a late plasma concentration peak (associated with release of the liposome-
encapsulated bupivacaine). These were mainly local anaesthesia studies: posterior spinal fusion (Study 
117), inguinal hernia (Study 201), total knee arthroplasty (Study 208), haemorrhoidectomy (Study 316), 
bunionectomy (Study 317), and regional ankle block for bunionectomy (Study 203). 
Early Tmax ranged from 0.3 – 1.36 hr while late Cmax occurred from 13.6 – 45.3 hr in those studies. 
Early and late Cmax values were higher at the administration sites of higher vascularity, consistent with 
the  published  literature.  The  highest  values  of  both  early  and  late  Cmax  were  in  haemorrhoidectomy 
(Study 316; early 722.2 ng/mL, late 454.1 ng/mL).   
Regional  analgesia  studies  exhibited  only  a  late  concentration  peak  with  detectable  systemic  plasma 
concentrations for a longer period compared to local analgesia. 
SmPC was updated to reflect absorption of bupivacaine from Exparel in different surgical models. 
Distribution 
The SmPC information regarding distribution provided by the applicant relies extensively on the product 
information of the approved bupivacaine HCl product. It can be agreed with the  that with regards to 
long  history  of  bupivacaine  use,  information  concerning  distribution  of  liposomal  bupivacaine  can  be 
generally based on published literature. The SmPC presents relevant data on bupivacaine distribution, 
as well as Exparel-specific information. 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 55/147 
 
  
 
 
No  human  studies  were  performed  to  investigate  disposition  of  lipid  components  of  Exparel 
(dierucoylphosphatidyl-choline  (DEPC),  dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-glycerol,  cholesterol  and  tricaprylin). 
According to the applicant, they are naturally occurring or are close analogues of endogenous lipids and 
are  expected  to  be  metabolised  like  naturally  occurring  lipids.  DEPC  is  a  novel  excipient  that  has  not 
been previously used in other medicinal products authorised in the EU. It is a major constituent of the 
lipid  bilayer  membrane  responsible  for  the  prolonged-release  characteristics  of  the  product.  The 
distribution of radiolabelled DEPC was evaluated in a study by quantitative whole-body autoradiography 
in rats. Please see Non-clinical discussion for further information.  
Elimination 
The SmPC information regarding elimination provided by the applicant relies extensively on the product 
information  of  the  approved  bupivacaine  HCl  product.  It  can  be  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  with 
regards to long history of bupivacaine use, information concerning elimination of liposomal bupivacaine 
can  be  generally  based  on  published  literature.  The  SmPC  was  revised  with  more  relevant  data  on 
bupivacaine elimination, as well as available Exparel-specific information.  
According  to  the  published  literature,  known  metabolic  pathways  include  N-dealkylation  to  PPX  and 
hydroxylation  to  4’-hydroxybupivacaine  and  3’-hydroxybupivacaine.  PPX  seems  to  be  the  major 
metabolite  of  bupivacaine  with  less  pharmacological  activity.  Metabolites  are  further  conjugated  with 
glucuronic acid and excreted by the kidney. 
Two-fold lower clearance values were obtained in the population PK model after nerve block (10.6 L/h) 
compared to a field block (22.9 L/h). The observed differences in CL/F are likely explained by the Exparel 
exhibiting flip-flop kinetics, when absorption rate is slower than the elimination rate and becomes the 
rate limiting step. This further indicates that terminal slope characterises the absorption process and not 
the elimination. 
Redosing 
Data on redosing are available only from a single Phase 1 study (Study 113) in healthy volunteers where 
Exparel was administered subcutaneously. Even though plasma levels of bupivacaine following redosing 
did not appear concerning for administration in healthy volunteers, there are no data on such clinical use 
in patients undergoing surgical procedure. There is no evidence that the patient would benefit from the 
administration of the second dose, no data on how the need for a second dose would be judged by the 
clinician nor when would be the appropriate time for its administration. Moreover, there is no safety data 
presented from the robust post-marketing setting that would support administration of the second dose. 
Therefore, Exparel is recommended for single-dose administration only. 
It is not known whether accumulation of DEPC could occur with redosing of Exparel. QBWA study in rats 
showed that DEPC can remain in the body even after 28 days. The applicant presumes the reason is its 
slow  release  from  the  liposomes.  Once  released  from  the  liposomes,  it  is  presumed  that  it  would  be 
rapidly cleared by the catabolism as the naturally occurring lipids. It is not considered likely that safety 
concerns would arise from accumulation.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dedicated renal impairment study was conducted, therefore, no specific dose recommendations for 
patients  with  renal  impairment  can  be  made.  Product  information  warns  about  the  risk  of  systemic 
toxicity  and  requires  caution  when  Exparel  is  administered  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  This  is 
supported. Additionally, results of the PopPK analysis for no effect of mild and moderate renal impairment 
have been added to section 5.2. 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 56/147 
 
  
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
The popPK model indicated the lack of effect of mild hepatic impairment on Exparel PK. 
A  dedicated  study  was  performed  in  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  As  a  worst-case 
scenario, the applicant presented estimated values and 90% confidence intervals for moderate hepatic 
impairment in surgical procedures with highest observed exposures (haemorrhoidectomy and intercostal 
nerve block). The exposure at the upper bound of 90%CI was below the safety threshold of 2000 ng/mL 
and even below 1500 ng/mL. It was considered highly unlikely that at total of 1500 ng/ml, the amount 
of  unbound  bupivacaine  concentration  for  a  moderately  hepatically  impaired  patient  could  reach  the 
toxicity threshold. 
In the graphical analysis submitted by the applicant, no clear correlation was found between measures 
of bupivacaine exposure (Cmax and AUC) and measures of hepatic function (albumin and total bilirubin).  
The active substance in Exparel is a racemic bupivacaine. Even though bupivacaine is administered as a 
racemate (mixture of equal concentrations of R- and S-enantiomer), the two enantiomers have different 
pharmacological properties. No enantiomeric analysis was performed in the hepatic impairment study. 
Instead, a justification was given using published literature showing that similar (R):(S) enantiomer ratio 
can be expected in healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic impairment.  
Subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not studied. Given the results of the moderate hepatic 
impairment  and  since  hepatic  metabolism  is  the  primary  route  of  bupivacaine  elimination,  significant 
effect on the bupivacaine exposure may be expected.  
SmPC proposes no dose adjustment in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. There are 
insufficient data to recommend the use of Exparel in patients with severe hepatic impairment. A warning 
follows that patients with hepatic disease may be more susceptible to potential toxicities of the amide-
type  local  anaesthetics  and  that increased  monitoring  for  LAST  should be  considered  in  subjects  with 
moderate to severe hepatic disease. 
Other intrinsic factors 
In  population  pharmacokinetic  models  based  on  nerve  block  and  wound  infiltration  clinical  studies, 
approximately  29%  decrease  in  clearance  was  observed  in  elderly  patients  which  was  not  considered 
clinically relevant. 
Interactions 
No DDI studies were performed. Limited information is available in the literature regarding bupivacaine 
potential to cause DDIs as well as the potential to be a victim of a DDI both via metabolic enzymes and 
transporters. A literature reference (Palkama, 1999) which describes the extent of interaction when a 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) was administered with bupivacaine, leading to approximately 20-
25% reduced bupivacaine clearance indicates that CYP3A4 may not be a major metabolic pathway. Since 
kidney  is  the  main  excretory  organ  for  bupivacaine  metabolites,  it  is  possible  that  some  transporters 
could be involved. Overall, due to very limited information, potential for interaction cannot be excluded. 
However,  considering  that  Exparel  is  intended  for  single  administration  and  there  is  a  long  history  of 
bupivacaine use, it is acceptable that SmPC relies on the product information of the approved bupivacaine 
HCl product, as well as relevant Exparel-specific information. 
Information on use with other local anaesthetics or active substances structurally related to amide-type 
local anaesthetics, e.g. certain anti-arrhythmics, such as lidocaine and mexiletine, because of additive 
systemic toxic effects has been added in the SmPC. 
A major issue was initially raised regarding admixing Exparel with bupivacaine HCl. In studies 331 (TKA) 
and 411 (caesarean section), where 266 mg Exparel was administered admixed with bupivacaine HCl 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 57/147 
 
  
 
 
(89  mg  and  44  mg  bupivacaine  base,  respectively),  there  were  no  PK  measurements  to  evaluate 
bupivacaine Cmax in such administration. 
Two new clinical studies were submitted where PK and safety of admixing Exparel with bupivacaine HCl 
were evaluated: 
•  Study 122 (a phase 1, pilot, open label study to evaluate PK and safety of Exparel administered 
as  sciatic  nerve  block  (in  popliteal  fossa)  for  postsurgical  analgesia  in  subjects  undergoing 
bunionectomy) – in regional analgesia 
•  Study 123 (a phase 1, pilot, open label study to evaluate PK and safety of Exparel administered 
as pectoral plane block in women undergoing breast augmentation surgery) – in local analgesia 
The SmPC allows admixing Exparel and bupivacaine HCl (immediate release formulation) in the same 
syringe if considered needed, as long as the ratio of the milligram dose of bupivacaine solution to Exparel 
does  not  exceed  1:2.  Since  such  admixing  could  in  some  cases  potentially  lead  to  exceeding  the 
maximum  daily  dose  of  bupivacaine  HCl  (400  mg)  and  reaching  the  safety  threshold  for  systemic 
bupivacaine  plasma  concentrations,  an  additional  warning,  as  well  as  the  formula  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the total bupivacaine HCl equivalents is stated. The total amount of bupivacaine HCl and 
Exparel being co-administered should not exceed 400 mg equivalents of bupivacaine HCl. Bupivacaine 
amount in Exparel is expressed as the free base of bupivacaine, thus, when calculating the total dose of 
bupivacaine for co-administration, the amount of bupivacaine from Exparel should be converted to the 
equivalent  of  bupivacaine  HCl  by  multiplying  Exparel  dose  with  a  factor  of  1.128.  Caution  is  advised 
when co-administering Exparel and bupivacaine HCl, particularly when administering to highly vascular 
areas where higher systemic absorption is expected. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  applicant  provided  comprehensive  PK  data  for  different  surgical  models.  High  variability  was 
observed  in  the  absorption  parameters  between  different  surgical  models.  More  rapid  absorption  and 
higher  exposures  are  expected  with  administration  in  more  vascular  areas.  Clinical  pharmacology  of 
Exparel is considered adequately characterised. 
2.6.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Six Phase 2 studies (201, 203, 207, 208, 209, 210) have been done. Study 211 that was terminated 
early  due  to  slow  enrolment  and  no  formal  efficacy  analysis  was  performed.  No  clear  dose-response 
correlation is obvious from the presented studies with the exception of Study 209. However, Phase 2 
results are of exploratory nature and the numbers analysed are small precluding any firm conclusions 
about efficacy to be made.  
2.6.2.  Main study(ies) 
The  applicant  has  completed  11  pivotal  Phase  3,  randomised,  double  blind,  multicentre  studies  to 
evaluate the efficacy of Exparel. The efficacy was assessed in seven pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies as a 
field block to provide local analgesia and in four pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies as a peripheral nerve 
block to provide regional analgesia. 
Two  pivotal  Phase  3  clinical  studies  (Study  331  and  Study  411)  evaluated  Exparel  admixed  with  IR 
bupivacaine. This was done because some clinicians admix Exparel with IR bupivacaine to control impact 
of nonpharmacologic factors (such as the dose, location, vascularity of the site of administration, and 
variance in surgical technique) on the time to onset of effective analgesia.

The pivotal Phase 3 studies in local analgesia and regional analgesia are summarised in section 2.5.1 of 
this report. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
The  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  enrolled  subjects  who were  undergoing  various surgeries  associated  with 
moderate-to-severe pain. The applicant claims that study populations represent a typical cross-section 
of  adult  patients  aged  18  years  or  older  who  experience  post-surgical  pain  for  the  respective  study 
procedures. Age ranged from 18 to 89 years. 
The  key  inclusion  criteria  across  the  studies  were  similar,  with  minor  differences  taking  into  account 
particular surgery. 
Key Inclusion criteria: 
•  male or female, ≥18 years of age,  
•  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1, 2, 3 or 4 (in particular studies) 
•  Were scheduled to undergo surgical procedure of interest (as per study protocol) 
Key exclusion criteria were similar across the studies with minor differences according to the particular 
surgical procedure  
Key exclusion criteria: 
•  Use of any of the following medications within the times specified before surgery: long-acting 
opioid medication or NSAIDs (except for low-dose aspirin used for cardioprotection) within 3 
days, or any opioid medication within 24 hours  
• 
Initiation  of  treatment  with  any  of  the  following  medications  within  1  month  of  study  drug 
administration  or  if  the  medication(s)  were  being  given  to  control  pain:  selective  serotonin 
reuptake  inhibitors,  selective  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors,  gabapentin,  pregabalin 
(Lyrica®), or duloxetine (Cymbalta®).  If a subject was taking one of these medications for a 
reason other than pain control, he/she must have been on a stable dose for at least 1 month 
prior to study drug administration. 
•  Current use of systemic glucocorticosteroids within 1 month of enrolment in the study. 
•  Severely  impaired  renal  or  hepatic  function  (e.g.,  serum  creatinine  level  >2  mg/dL  [176.8 
level  >50  mg/dL  [17.9  mmol/L],  serum  aspartate 
µmol/L],  blood  urea  nitrogen 
aminotransferase level >3 times the upper limit of normal, or serum alanine aminotransferase 
level >3 times the upper limit of normal) 
•  Any neurologic or psychiatric disorder that might have impacted postsurgical pain or interfered 
with study assessments 
•  Malignancy in the last 2 years, according to physician discretion 
•  Rheumatoid or inflammatory arthritis or disease that required chronic analgesic treatment 
•  Administration  of  an  investigational  drug  within  30  days  or  5  elimination  half-lives  of  such 
investigational  drug,  whichever  was  longer,  prior  to  study  drug  administration,  or  planned 
administration  of  another  investigational  product  or  procedure  during  the  subject’s 
participation in this study 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 59/147 
 
  
 
 
 
Treatments 
In  all  studies  except  Study  326  patients  were  randomised  into  2  treatment  groups.  However,  in  the 
Study 326 later enrolment in the second Exparel dosing group was stopped due to new published data 
on efficacy of a particular dose. Either placebo or IR bupivacaine was used as a comparator in all clinical 
studies. The comparators used in the efficacy studies are in compliance with the current guidelines, and 
IR bupivacaine is considered as a standard of care, thus acceptable as an active control. Exparel doses 
in SmPC are in line with the doses studied. 
In a local analgesia studies a single dose of study drug was administered intraoperatively via field block 
on Day 1. 
In a regional analgesia studies a study drug was administered via nerve block 1-2 hours prior surgery 
or after the posterolateral thoracotomy (in study 322). 
Rescue medication 
In  all  studies,  rescue  pain  medication  was  available  for  subjects  for  whom  study  medication  did  not 
provide adequate pain relief. When study drug medication was perceived to be inadequate, subjects had 
the option to receive a pre-specified regimen of rescue pain medication. The choice of the drug, dose, 
and sequence (i.e., first-line, second-line, etc.) for each study was selected based on what was thought 
to be most appropriate for the surgical model and clinical situation. The types of rescue pain medication 
used in the clinical development programme included oral acetaminophen/paracetamol, opioid analgesics 
(oral, intramuscular [IM], or intravenous [IV] or via PC pump), and IR local anaesthetics. For all studies, 
opioid consumption is reported as the morphine equivalent dose. 
The rescue medication varied across studies due to differences in the pain models (surgical procedures) 
studied. The use of opioid and non-opioid rescue medications is considered acceptable.  
Objectives 
The primary objective in local and regional analgesia studies was to demonstrate superiority of Exparel 
vs  comparator,  to  evaluate  the  magnitude  and  duration  of  the  effect  of  a  single  intraoperative 
administration  or  single-dose  injection  block  of  Exparel  vs  comparator,  to  demonstrate  the  analgesic 
efficacy of single-dose local administration of Exparel compared with placebo, or to compare pain control 
and total opioid consumption following local infiltration analgesia with Exparel. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints for most of the Phase 3 studies were the cumulative pain intensity for a 
pre-specified  duration  as  measured  by  the  area  under  the  curve  (AUC).  For  each  endpoint,  AUC  was 
measured for a duration of effect appropriate to the surgical model under investigation.  
The applicant claimed that use of cumulative pain intensity scores over an extended duration as a primary 
efficacy  endpoint  was  considered  appropriate  since  the  treatment  goal  with  local  anaesthetics  is  the 
prevention  of  moderate-to-severe  pain.  The  treatment  paradigm  for  local  anaesthetics  contrasts  with 
studies  of  other  analgesics  (e.g.,  opioids)  whose  efficacy  is  measured  based  on  reductions  in  pain 
intensity from baseline, which is typically assessed by the sum of pain intensity differences. 
Each  of  the  Phase  3  studies  assessed  postsurgical  opioid  consumption-related  endpoints.  The  key 
secondary efficacy endpoints in the Exparel clinical development programme included: 
• 
• 
• 
total consumption of postsurgical opioids 
percentage of opioid-free subjects 
time to first use of opioid rescue medication 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 60/147 
 
  
 
 
Additional  secondary  endpoints  were  collected,  as  appropriate,  to  assess  the  secondary  objectives  of 
each study. Other secondary endpoints evaluated during clinical development included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
sensory and motor function assessments 
overall benefit of analgesia score (OBAS), a multidimensional instrument that assesses 
pain, satisfaction, and symptoms 
subject satisfaction with overall analgesia 
discharge readiness using the Modified Postanesthesia Discharge Scoring System 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
In pivotal phase 3 local analgesia studies patients were randomised at the ratio 1:1, except Study 329, 
where Exparel was used in patients undergoing third molar extraction and randomisation ratio was 2:1. 
In pivotal phase 3 regional analgesia studies patients were randomised at the ratio 1:1, except Study 
326 where subjects were randomised at the ration 1:1:1. 
The randomisation code was generated by a centralised randomisation system, which was also used to 
communicate  subject  randomisations  to  the  study  sites.    All  randomised  subjects  had  both  a  unique 
subject identifier and a unique random code identifier.  No subject or random code identifiers were reused 
once assigned. 
In the relevant studies the randomisation was stratified by site and modality of anaesthesia. 
Exparel and placebo are visually distinguishable; therefore, to maintain the double-blind study design, 
only unblinded study personnel who were NOT involved with protocol-specific, postsurgical assessments 
prepared the study drug.  Staff members conducting study-specific, postsurgical assessments and the 
subjects remained blinded to the assigned treatment throughout the study.  If a subject experienced a 
serious  AE  (SAE),  the  applicant  did  not  automatically  unblind  the  subject’s  treatment,  unless  it  was 
necessary to manage treatment of the SAE. 
The  applicant  noted,  that  site  surveys  suggested  that  study  sites  would  vary  in  their  standard  (and 
feasible)  procedures  for  preparing  sterile  study  drug  in  a  blinded  fashion.    Therefore,  each  site  was 
responsible for providing their written blinding procedures for study drug preparation and transportation.  
This documentation (eg, site-specific blinding plan) was made available to the applicant for review before 
the site enrolled a subject into the study.  The site-specific blinding plan outlined the study treatment 
blinding process that was to be followed at the site throughout the study.   
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods used were similar across the studies with differences related to endpoints, sample 
size and such study characteristics as sites (only US or US and Europe). 
Descriptive summaries were provided where appropriate for each of the primary and secondary efficacy 
and safety endpoints. 
Efficacy  data  were  summarised  by  treatment  group.  Exparel  was  compared  with  placebo  or  IR 
bupivacaine using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and site (where 
appropriate) as the main effect for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
For  comparisons  of  Exparel  to  placebo  for  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  the  analysis  of  variance 
(ANOVA),  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  tests  and  log-rank  tests  for  continuous  and  categorical  endpoints 
where appropriate were used.

In all studies except for Study 311 and 312, pain intensity scores were imputed for use of rescue pain 
medication  using  the  worst  windowed  observation  carried  forward  method.  The  worst  windowed 
observation  carried  forward  method  imputed  pre-rescue  pain  intensity  scores  for  the  half-life  of  the 
respective rescue medication.  
For the analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints in some studies a hierarchical, fixed-sequence stepwise 
testing  procedure  was  used.  If  the  first  test  was  significant  at  the  0.05  level,  only  then,  the  next 
secondary efficacy measure was tested, and so forth.  The results were declared statistically significant 
at the 0.05 significance level. 
In some studies, there were several amendments to the initial SAP. The major amendment and post-
hoc  analysis  were  performed  in  Study  329.  In  general  SAPs  are  considered  acceptable  and  statistical 
analysis methods used, including handling of missing data and use of rescue medication are considered 
adequate.

Study 327 initially evaluated both 133-mg and 266-mg doses of Exparel. Shortly after enrolment in the 
study was initiated, newly published data from an investigator-initiated trial became available suggesting 
that  the  133-mg  dose  of  Exparel  provided  adequate  magnitude  and  duration  of  analgesic  effect 
(Vandepitte et al 2017), so an administration decision was made to discontinue enrolment in the 266 mg 
group. 
All  studies  in  the  clinical  development  programme  were  conducted  on  an  inpatient  basis,  so  study 
completion rates were generally high. 
Overall, the discontinuation rates were low. Only in regional analgesia studies (Study 322 and 323) the 
reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy. The discontinuation rates due to adverse effect was low 
across all studies and the rates were lower in Exparel group. 
Baseline data 
The  study  population  in  all  Phase  3  studies  reflects  common  standard  population  in  terms  of  surgical 
procedures and age distribution/mean age. Although there are differences in the baseline characteristics 
and demographics across studies, the comparison groups in each study were overall well balanced.

Numbers analysed 
The primary efficacy analysis population (i.e., Full Analysis Set [FAS] or Efficacy Analysis Set [EAS]) for 
each respective study is comprised of subjects who received study drug, underwent the planned surgical 
procedure, and for whom AUC of pain intensity scores could be calculated. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Phase 3 Studies in Local Analgesia (311, 312, 316, 317, 329, 331, and 411) 
Seven pivotal Phase 3 studies evaluated Exparel as a field block to provide local analgesia at a range of 
doses from 106 mg to 532 mg in TKA, haemorrhoidectomy, bunionectomy, third molar extraction, and 
caesarean section. Four studies were active-controlled studies against IR bupivacaine and three studies 
were placebo-controlled. The primary efficacy endpoint results are summarised in Table 20. 
Table 20: Primary Efficacy Endpoint Results in Pivotal Phase 3 Studies in Local Analgesia 
AUC = area under the curve; CI = confidence interval; IR Bupi = immediate-release bupivacaine; NRS-A0-72 = numerical rating 
scale with activity from 0 to 72 hours; NRS-R0-24 = numerical rating scale at rest from 0 to 24 hours; NRS-R0-48 = numerical 
rating scale at rest from 0 to 48 hours; NRS-R0-72 = numerical rating scale at rest from 0 to 72 hours; NRS-R0-96 = numerical 
rating scale at rest from 0 to 96 hours; TKA = total knee arthroplasty; VAS12-48 = visual analogue scale from 12 hours to 48 
hours

Table 21: Summary of Key Opioid Endpoint Results in Positive Phase 3 Local Analgesia 
Studies 
Studies 316, 317, 331, and 411 in local analgesia met their respective primary efficacy endpoints. These 
studies demonstrated the analgesic efficacy of Exparel doses of 106 mg to 266 mg through 24 to 72 
hours. The applicant concluded that, these studies showed that Exparel extends the maximum duration 
of analgesic effect that can be achieved with conventional IR bupivacaine when used to provide for local 
analgesia  for  the  management  of  acute  pain  with  a  reduction  in  the  need  for  opioid  rescue  pain 
medication. 
Three  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  in  local  analgesia  (Studies  311,  312,  and  329)  did  not  achieve  their 
respective  primary  efficacy  endpoint.  The  applicant  argue,  that  acute  pain  studies  are  known  to  be 
subject to a wide variety of study design, methodologic, and study conduct issues that can reduce the 
ability to detect a statistically significant effect of an efficacious medication. 
Phase 3 Studies in Regional Analgesia (322, 323 Part 2, 326, 327) 
Four pivotal, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies evaluated Exparel as a peripheral nerve block to provide 
regional analgesia at either the 133 mg or 266 mg doses in posterolateral thoracotomy, TKA, or TSA/RCR. 
The primary efficacy endpoint results are summarised in Table 22.

The summary of significant key opioid endpoint results is provided in Table 23. 
Table 23: Summary of Key Opioid Endpoint Results in Positive Phase 3 Regional Analgesia 
Studies 
Studies 323 (Part 2) and 327 in regional analgesia met their respective primary efficacy endpoints. These 
studies  demonstrated  the  analgesic  efficacy  of  Exparel  133  mg  or  266  mg  through  48  to  72  hours. 
Together, these studies showed that Exparel prolongs the maximum duration of analgesic effect that can 
be achieved with conventional IR bupivacaine when used as a peripheral nerve block, which has a labelled 
duration of effect of 4 to 8 hours. 
Overall comment on Phase 3 local analgesia studies 
Out of 7 studies 4 studies met primary endpoint showing favourable effect of Exparel versus comparator. 
There was one negative and one positive study in TKA and haemorrhoidectomy. Study in bunionectomy 
and Caesarean section also were positive.  
Overall comment on Phase 3 regional analgesia studies 
Out of 4 studies 2 studies met primary endpoint showing favourable effect of Exparel versus comparator. 
There was one negative and one positive study in TKA. Study in TSA/RCR also were positive. The study 
in thoracotomy was negative. 
The curves of the mean scores over the time showed longer effect of Exparel compared to IR bupivacaine 
and placebo, however, regarding IR bupivacaine these differences not exceeded time period defined in 
the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The applicant has provided discussion on the possible factors leading to and findings in negative studies. 
It can be concluded that the applicant has not demonstrated the efficacy of Exparel in all studied pain 
models. There were limitations of studies, for example add-on design, methodological issues, impact of 
concomitant therapies, clinical relevance of data, extrapolation from US to EU population etc, that were 
discussed during the procedure. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses of the AUC of pain intensity scores were conducted for the positive pivotal Phase 3 
Studies: 316, 317, 331, 411 in local analgesia and 323 (Part 2) and 327 in regional analgesia. Some 
subgroup analyses were underpowered and are generally of marginal importance. Supportive analyses 
were generally consistent with primary analyses. They are not deemed additive to the body of evidence.  
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 70/147 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant concluded, that overall, the analyses of subpopulations in pivotal Phase 3 studies in the 
development programme demonstrate that the long-acting analgesic benefits of Exparel can be expected 
in both local and regional analgesia across patients of varying age, sex, race, BMI, and geography.

Notes 
The relatively low average pain scores in both groups throughout the 96-hour 
period  suggests  that  the  study  had  low  assay  sensitivity  for  evaluating  the 
analgesic benefits of a long-acting local anaesthetic. No significant differences 
in  the  consumption  of  opioid  rescue  pain  medication,  the  percentage  of 
subjects who received opioids through 96 hours, or the 
time to first use of opioid rescue pain medication were observed.

The cumulative pain intensity scores with Exparel 266 mg + IR bupivacaine 
44 mg were statistically non-inferior to IR bupivacaine alone from 0 through 
72 hours. There were no statistically significant differences observed in the 
time to first use of

Notes 
After enrolment in the study was initiated, newly published data from an 
investigator-initiated trial became available suggesting that the 133-mg 
dose of Exparel provided adequate magnitude and duration of analgesic 
effect, so an administration decision was made to discontinue enrolment 
in the 266 mg group. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was met. The LS mean AUC VAS0-48 was 
statistically significantly lower in the Exparel 133 mg group than the 
placebo group. The total postsurgical opioid consumption through 48 
hours was statistically significantly lower in the Exparel 133 mg group 
than the placebo group. The percentage of opioid-free subjects was 
statistically significantly greater in the Exparel 133 mg group (13%) than 
the placebo group (1.4%) at 48 hours. The time to first use of opioid 
rescue pain medication was statistically significantly longer in the 
Exparel 133 mg group than the placebo group through 48 hours. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant did not perform analysis across trials. Moreover, the 11 main Phase 3 studies are highly 
heterogeneous which precludes any pooling. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No formal studies in elderly patients, patients with renal and hepatic impairment were performed.  
Elderly  
The local and regional analgesia studies included patients 65 years of age and older (up to 88 years). 
Most of the patients were in age group 65-74, followed by age group 75-85. The age group 85+ included 
only 7 patients.   
The applicant stated that of the 1109 subjects who received EXPAREL in the Local Analgesia Pool, 214 
subjects were ≥65 years of age and 59 subjects were ≥75 years of age. Of the 536 subjects who received 
EXPAREL in the Regional Analgesia Pool, 255 subjects were ≥65 years of age and 63 subjects were ≥75 
years of age. No adverse drug-related effects with EXPAREL were observed related to older age. Clinical 
experience with Exparel has not identified differences in efficacy between elderly and younger patients, 
but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 
Ancillary analysis was performed in the subgroup of patients <65 years versus ≥ 65 years. 
The applicant noted that due to the differences in study designs, durations of treatment, and primary 
efficacy endpoint definitions, the results cannot be pooled across studies. 
The  applicant  also  claimed  that  in  clinical  studies,  differences  in  various  PK  parameters  have  been 
observed between elderly and younger individuals. Bupivacaine is known to be substantially excreted by 
the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to bupivacaine may be greater in patients with impaired renal 
function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken 
in dose selection of Exparel.

Renal and hepatic impairment 
The  applicant  relays  on  the  published  data  and  pharmacokinetic  study  in  hepatic  impairment  study 
(Study 110).  
The applicant stated that bupivacaine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk 
of  toxic  reactions  may  be  greater  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  function.  This  should  be  considered 
when performing dose selection of Exparel. 
Furthermore, amide-type local anaesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolised by the liver. Patients 
with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolise local anaesthetics normally, are at 
a  greater  risk  of  developing  toxic  plasma  concentrations,  and  potentially  local  anaesthetic  systemic 
toxicity. Therefore, consider increased monitoring for local anaesthetic systemic toxicity in subjects with 
moderate-to-severe hepatic disease. 
The results of the hepatic impairment study found that the relative magnitude of the differences in PK 
parameters  do  not  indicate  that  a  dosage  adjustment  is  required  for  patients  with  mild  to  moderate 
hepatic impairment. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development of Exparel is based on 9 Phase 3 studies (main studies). The studies are grouped 
according to the type of analgesia studied: 5 main studies in local analgesia (Exparel administered as a 
field  block)  and  4  main  studies  in  regional  analgesia  (Exparel  administered  as  a  field  block).  Two 
additional studies in local analgesia are designated as supportive (Studies 331 and 411, which had an 
add-on  design  to  IR  bupivacaine).  In  all  main  local  analgesia  studies,  a  single  dose  of  Exparel  was 
administered at the end of the studied surgical procedure. In all main regional analgesia studies, a single 
dose of Exparel was administered prior to the studied surgical procedure. 
•  Design 
All of the 9 main studies were randomised, double blind, multicentre, active or placebo-controlled trials.  
Exparel  is  visually  distinguishable  from  the  comparators  (both  placebo  and  bupivacaine  HCl).  The 
applicant provided satisfactory explanations regarding varying blinding practices within and across phase 
3 clinical studies. Overall a very small number of unblinding events was reported, only 2 such events in 
Study 411. 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 104/147 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Studies were multicentre, and a large number of centres was included across all phase 3 clinical trials. 
The vast majority of studies were conducted in the US. Only one study was entirely conducted in Europe 
(316), while three were partially conducted in Europe (322, 326, 327). Out of 1131 patients who received 
Exparel in the main studies, 373 were from Europe, which is about 33%. The applicant provided a short 
discussion on the issue of generalisability to the EU population. Multimodal analgesia regimens are used 
in both the US and EU. However, literature data indicates statistically significant lower pain scores in the 
first day after orthopaedic surgery and overall less opioids being used in European countries compared 
to the US. Therefore, the limited benefits observed in clinical studies with Exparel can be expected to be 
even smaller in everyday clinical practice in Europe.  
•  Population 
The following pain models were used in the Phase 3 clinical programme: total knee arthroplasty (311, 
331,  323,  326),  haemorrhoidectomy  (312,  316),  bunionectomy  (317),  third  molar  extraction  (329), 
caesarean  section  (411),  posterolateral  thoracotomy  (322),  total  shoulder  arthroplasty/rotator  cuff 
repair (327). 
In  general,  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  consistent  with  the  target  population  for  each 
surgical model. However,  patients with concurrent painful physical conditions were excluded. Patients 
with knee osteoarthritis and pain arising from both knees could not be included in the TKA studies, since 
study drug is expected to show a local effect only. The exclusion of these patients is reasonable; however 
it does not correctly reflect the clinical practice.  
•  Comparator  
According  to  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  clinical  development  of  medicinal  products  intended  for  the 
treatment of pain (EMA/CHMP/970057/2011), placebo is an acceptable comparator; active comparator 
of  known  effectiveness  provides  context  to  the  measured  differences  from  placebo  and  facilitates  an 
evaluation of the clinical relevance of those differences.  
Regarding results among clinical studies with an active comparator (311, 312, 331 and 411) they are 
not  supportive  of  Exparel.  Briefly,  studies  311  and  312  failed  to  show  superiority  of  Exparel  over 
bupivacaine  HCl+epinephrine.  Study  331  showed  statistically  significant  superiority  over  comparator 
while Study 411 confirmed non-inferiority (superiority was not confirmed). However, studies 331 and 
411  had  an  add-on  design,  in  which  Exparel+bupivacaine  was  compared  to  bupivacaine.  The  dose  of 
bupivacaine in bupivacaine-only groups is too low to be considered a valid comparator, both in Study 
331 and 411. Thus, superiority of Exparel to an active comparator is not robustly demonstrated.  
In general, bupivacaine with epinephrine might be a more suitable comparator than bupivacaine without 
epinephrine, since the former has a more prolonged duration of action and can be administered in higher 
doses. The applicant failed to scientifically justify not using bupivacaine+epinephrine as a comparator in 
studies 331 and 411. 
None of the studies in regional analgesia setting was performed with an active comparator arm, which 
makes it difficult to put the observed results in a clinical context, although placebo as a comparator is 
acceptable. 
•  Endpoints and the duration of study 
All of the main Phase 3 studies defined AUC of pain intensity scores and total postoperative opioid use 
as primary or secondary outcomes. However, the endpoints are remarkably different across studies, as 
can be seen in the table below.

Differences in outcomes  and  time  periods  used  for primary  analyses  (that  vary  from  24  to  96  hours) 
makes comparisons across studies difficult. Total postoperative opioids are not uniformly defined either. 
The definition of opioid-sparing in Study 411 is arbitrary and of exploratory value.  
Otherwise, outcomes are appropriate and in agreement with the Scientific Advice obtained by NCAs. 
•  Baseline analgesics and rescue medication  
Although opioids were generally used as rescue medication is all main Phase 3 studies, differences exist. 
Permitted analgesics, administered to every patient in the study for providing baseline pain management, 
varied notably across studies.  
Although baseline and rescue medications are generally appropriate, the variability across studies makes 
comparisons difficult. Study 317 is the only study where a fixed-combination of oxycodone/paracetamol 
was used as rescue medication. In studies 311, 322 and 323 the use of PCA pumps was permitted.  
 An  evaluation  on  the  impact  of  concomitant  multimodal  analgesia  on  the  efficacy  of  Exparel  was 
provided. Overall, the concomitant therapy was well balanced across treatment groups. At least in some 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 107/147 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
clinical settings, tramadol would have been used instead of stronger opioids. Tramadol was not utilised 
in the clinical development programme of Exparel.  
•  Methods, Conduct, Analysis 
The main efficacy population in local analgesia studies is generally defined as randomised subjects 
who underwent the surgical procedure, were given study drug and had at least a defined (varying across 
studies)  number  of  measurements  taken  in  the  post-surgical  period.  The  main  efficacy  population  in 
regional  analgesia  studies  is  generally  defined  as  randomised  subjects  who  underwent  the  surgical 
procedure and were given the study drug.  
Although the definitions of efficacy populations in Phase 3 studies are not entirely in line with the ITT 
principle, small numbers of randomised patients were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses in the 
majority  of  studies.  Exclusions  are  not  negligible  in  3  studies  –  Study  311  (11%  patients  excluded); 
Study 329 (45.1% patients excluded); Study 411 (27% patients excluded). Since studies 311 and 329 
failed to meet their primary endpoint, and adequate explanations were provided, focus remains on post-
randomisation exclusions in Study 411 that did meet its primary endpoint. 
The absence of a true ITT population is most prominent in Study 411, where the applicant defines the 
Efficacy Analysis set as follows: patients who received study drug, underwent C-section, met criteria for 
correct  TAP  placement,  local  anaesthetic  dosing,  and  a  multimodal  post-operative  analgesic  regimen. 
Patients were excluded not due to non-existing data, and not due to non-existence of pain (like in other 
Phase 3 studies), but due to not following the protocol strictly. This definition is not in accordance with 
the ICH E9 Guideline and it resulted in exclusion of 26% randomised patients from Exparel+bupivacaine 
group and almost 28% of randomised patients from bupivacaine-only group. The applicant was asked to 
provide re-analysed results using all randomised and treated patients. The re-analysed results show that 
the statistically significant reduction in the use of opioids through 72 hours observed in Exparel arm was 
lost  when  all  randomised  and  treated  subjects  were  included  in  the  analysis.  Results  for  the  primary 
outcome for the re-analyses show a LS mean treatment difference of-2.9 MME with a wide 95% CI that 
crosses zero (95% CI -15.4 to 9.6) and a p-value of 0.33. No difference between treatment arms was 
found for any of the secondary outcomes related to the use of opioids in the re-analyses. 
Although protocols of studies 316, 317 and 323 allowed for the exclusion of non-responders, no such 
exclusions were made.  
The amount of missing and imputed data was provided in line with the Guideline on missing data in 
confirmatory clinical trials (EMA/CPMP/EWP/1776/99 Rev. 1). In Study 331, in the period from 12 to 48 
hours,  the  proportion  of  missing  pain  intensity  scores  was  between  11.6%  and  52.9%  in  Exparel+IR 
bupivacaine group and between 8.7% to 42% in IR bupivacaine group. This is a substantial amount of 
missing data, and no imputation method is considered to be adequate. Also, there is more missing data 
in IR bupivacaine than in Exparel+IR bupivacaine group at all timepoints in the designated window of 12 
to 48 hours (the difference is from 2.3% to 10.9%). Since the nature of the missing data is unknown 
(wasn’t recorded), the proposed reasons for missing data are hypothetical.  Due to a large proportion of 
missing data with an imbalance in the amount of missing data between treatment arms and without the 
knowledge  of  the  nature  of  missing  data,  results  regarding  pain  scores  from  study  331  should  be 
interpreted with great caution. 
In  Study  411,  the  proportion  of  missing  pain  intensity  scores  in  the  period  from  6  to  72  hours  was 
between  1.4%  and  18.8%  in  Exparel+IR  bupivacaine  group  and  between  1.6%  and  23.1%  in  IR 
bupivacaine group; no clear pattern in missing data was observed. Therefore, the pre-defined multiple 
imputation method is adequate for handling missing data. The amount of missing data in studies 323 
and 327 is small and therefore of less concern for the validity of study results.

During a pre-defined interim analysis for efficacy and sample size recalculation in Study 411, criteria for 
futility  were  met.  However,  due  to  deviations  in  the  use  of  multimodal  analgesia  observed  in  the 
beginning  of  the  trial,  the  applicant  chose  to  continue  the  study  and  exclude  patients  enrolled  in  the 
beginning  of  the  trial.  Then  a  second,  unscheduled  interim  analysis  occurred,  with  the  purpose  to 
evaluate  efficacy  and  sample  size.  No  adjustments  for  the  type I  error  were  performed.  Unscheduled 
unadjusted interim analyses looking into efficacy of a medicinal product are not endorsed in the context 
of phase 3 clinical trials. 
In general, satisfactory justifications for other study conduct issues were provided by the applicant.

The applicant discussed the likely reasons for not meeting the primary endpoint in 5 main studies. 
In Study 311 potent IV opioids were used too liberally; post-surgery pain scores were low in Studies 
312 and 326; possible leakage of Exparel was observed in Study 329; in study 322 too few nerves 
were blocked for the large incision site and PK data suggests the drug was absorbed and cleared very

quickly,  consistent  with  administration  into  a  highly  vascular  field.  Several  general  difficulties  of 
conducting studies of local anaesthetics in the surgical setting were identified. One of the main difficulties 
is the inability to enrich the study population so that it includes only patients with a baseline pain score 
above a certain level, since the source of pain is the surgical insult, i.e., pain is not present before the 
surgery. Also, local anaesthetic is applied intraoperatively and prophylactically, and this precludes the 
ability to titrate the medicinal product. Heterogeneity of the study population that cannot be accounted 
for before the medicinal product is administered is another identified problem. 
Following  remarks  concern  the  uncertainties  of  the  results  in  the  studies  that  reached  the  primary 
endpoint: 
Study 316 reached statistically significant results over all key outcomes. However, lack of a statistically 
significant  difference  concerning  PONV-free  time,  use  of  antiemetics  and  postoperative  constipation 
seems to suggest that the reduction in the use of opioids seen in Exparel arm did not translate into a 
reduction in opioid-related adverse events. As per one of the sensitivity analysis, when wWOCF for rescue 
pain medication is not applied, the difference in primary outcome did not reach statistical significance. 
In  Study  331  a  statistically  significant  difference  according  to  the  second  co-primary  outcome  (total 
opioid consumption through 48 hours) was observed. However, the range of total opioid used was very 
wide  in  both  groups.  Patient’s  perception  of  pain  intensity  and  opioid-related  adverse  effects  (OBAS 
questionnaire) was similar in both groups which is surprising given the magnitude of reduction in opioid 
use. In addition, Study 331 suffered from a large amount of missing data (at times larger than 50% with 
notable  differences  between  treatment  arms)  on  the  first  co-primary  endpoint  (AUC  of  VAS)  making 
conclusion unreliable. This is confirmed when additional analyses without imputations for missing scores 
are performed - primary results are no longer statistically significant. Also, the dose of IR bupivacaine in 
the comparator arm is too low according to clinical practice, and this favours the experimental (Exparel) 
arm.  
Study  411  also  suffers  from  serious  methodological  issues.  The  primary  efficacy  population  excludes 
more than a quarter of all randomised patients. When all randomised and treated patients were analysed, 
the difference in total opioid use through 72 hours (primary endpoint) in Exparel vs comparator groups 
was no longer statistically significant. An unplanned interim analysis evaluating efficacy was performed 
without  adjustment  for  type  I  error.  The  dose  of  IR  bupivacaine  in  the  comparator  arm  is  too  low 
according to clinical practice, which favours the experimental (Exparel) arm.  
In 3 studies that met their primary endpoint an issue about opioids requiring thorough discussion is 
identified. Out of initially opioid-free patients, more of them allocated to Exparel required an opioid at 
later timepoints compared to those allocated to the comparator. This was observed in Study 411, where 
4 additional subjects (5.6%) in the Exparel + IR bupivacaine group and 1 additional subject (1.5%) in 
the IR bupivacaine group who were opioid free at 72 hours received opioid rescue through Day 14. The 
same pattern is observed in Study 317, where additional 5 patients (5.1%) who were rescue-free at 24 
hours in Exparel group required an opioid from 24-72 hours, while in placebo group no additional patients 
required  rescue  medications  from  24-72  hours.  The  same  pattern  is  observed  in  Study  327,  where 
additional  12  patients  (17.4%)  who  were  opioid-free  through  24  hours  in  Exparel  group  required  an 
opioid from 24-72 hours, while in placebo group no additional patients required opioids from 24-72 hours.  
Although  numerically  more  patients  in  Exparel  group  required  an  opioid  after  the  primary  timepoint 
compared  to  placebo  group,  the  absolute  numbers  of  opioid-free  patients  and  the  between-group 
differences were too small for reliable conclusions to be drawn.  
Overall, a lack of consistency of results is observed, both across studies (i.e., the magnitude of results 
for  identical  endpoints)  and  within  studies  (i.e.,  the  magnitude  of  reduction  in  AUC  of  pain  intensity 
scores  does  not  correspond  to  the  magnitude  of  reduction  in  total  opioid  use).  From  the  discussion 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 111/147 
 
  
 
 
presented by the applicant it can be concluded that background anaesthesia and the type of surgery are 
not related to the heterogeneous results observed. 
Data from a phase 1 Study 109 demonstrate that the expected time to onset of analgesia with Exparel 
is 2 minutes.  
The duration of analgesic effect of Exparel shown in clinical studies varies, as presented below.  
In Study 316, 95% CIs of Mean pain intensity scores of Exparel and placebo start to overlap from 12 
hours onwards and the difference in the use of opioids is driven by the difference in opioid consumption 
in the first 24 hours, while opioid consumption in the period from 24 hours to 72 hours is similar in both 
groups.  Therefore,  we  can  say  that  the  observed  duration  of  analgesic  efficacy  shown  for  Exparel  in 
Study 316 is 24 hours (and not 72 hours as claimed by the applicant).  
In Study 317, although 95% CIs of Mean pain intensity scores of Exparel and placebo start to overlap 
from 8 hours onwards, total opioid use is significantly lower in Exparel compared to placebo during the 
first 24 hours. Therefore, the duration of analgesic efficacy shown for Exparel in Study 317 is 24 hours.  
In Study 323, 95% CIs of the Mean pain intensity scores of Exparel and placebo start to overlap from 
around  8  hours  forward  (with  the  exception  noted  at  the  24  hours  timepoint).  The  reduction  in  total 
opioids in present through 72 hours in Exparel group, although this reduction is mainly driven by the 
difference  in  opioid  consumption  observed  in  the  first  24  hours.  Therefore,  the  duration  of  analgesic 
efficacy shown for Exparel in Study 323 is between 24 and 48 hours.  
In Study 327, 95% CIs of the Mean pain intensity scores of Exparel and placebo overlap at the 48-hour 
timepoint, but not before that. Although the timepoint defined as the basis for primary evaluations is 48 
hours, a clinically relevant reduction in the use of opioids is achieved for all evaluated periods (i.e., 0-
24h, 24-48h and 48-72h). Therefore, the duration of analgesic efficacy shown for Exparel in Study 327 
is 72 hours.  
The duration of analgesic efficacy as shown in pivotal phase 3 trials is 24 hours in local analgesia studies 
and between 24 hours and 72 hours in regional analgesia studies.  
•  Magnitude and clinical relevance of the effect 
All of the main Phase 3 studies defined AUC of pain intensity scores and total postoperative opioid use 
as primary or secondary outcomes. The interpretation of AUC of pain intensity scores is difficult and not 
straightforward.  However,  a  time-averaged  difference  >1  in  pain  intensity  scores  (i.e.,  the  AUC 
treatment  difference  divided  by  the  total  time  in  hours  under  observation)  would  be  indicative  of  a 
clinically  significant  overall  effect  although  this  measure  doesn’t  take  into  account  the  magnitude  of 
difference at each time point and disregards the amount of opioids used to achieve the pain intensity 
scores observed. 
A summary of opioid-related outcomes (total postoperative opioid consumption and proportion of opioid-
free  subjects)  through  48  and  72  hours  will  be  presented  in  the  table  below,  regardless  of  statistical 
considerations about hierarchy or multiplicity.

An  interpretation  encompassing  the  magnitude  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  results  is 
presented below. 
Study 316 (haemorrhoidectomy);  Exparel 266 mg vs placebo; primary outcome AUC0-72 of 
the NRS-R 
The observed difference in AUC0-72 of NRS-R was -60.7 points (95%CI -90.4 to -31.0) in Exparel group 
compared to placebo. This translates into a reduction in AUC of the NRS-R of about 30% over 72 hours, 
which  is  consistent  with  all  population  values  in  the  range  of  a  15%  to  45%  reduction  with  Exparel 
compared to placebo. Hypothesis testing yielded a p-value of <0.0001, meaning that the probability of 
observing such a result if the null hypothesis of no difference between treatments was correct, is very 
small. When presented as the time-averaged difference in pain intensity scores, this corresponds to a 
reduction of 0.84 points in the period of 72 hours. Since this is <1, it is not clinically relevant. Regarding 
pain intensity, 95% CIs of Mean pain intensity scores of Exparel and placebo start to overlap from 12 
hours onwards. As per one of the sensitivity analysis, when wWOCF for rescue pain medication is not 
applied, primary outcome is no longer statistically significant. 
Total opioid consumption through 72 hours is significantly lower in Exparel group (9.9 mg vs 18.2 mg of 
morphine equivalent). However, this result is driven by the difference in opioid consumption in the first 
24 hours (5.4 mg in Exparel vs 12.9 mg in placebo), opioid consumption in the period from 24 hours to 
72  hours  is  similar  in  both  groups  (4.5  mg  in  Exparel  vs  5.3  mg  in  placebo).  Moreover,  lack  of  a 
statistically  significant  difference  concerning  PONV-free  time,  use  of  antiemetics  and  postoperative 
constipation through 72 hours (all pre-defined as other efficacy outcomes) suggest that the reduction in 
the use of opioids seen in Exparel arm did not translate into a clinically measurable benefit in opioid-
related adverse events. The proportion of opioid-free patients through 72 hours (27.7% vs 9.7%) and 
time to first use of opioid (14.3 h vs 1.2 h) favour Exparel over placebo with statistically significant p-
values. 
In summary, clinical relevance of the primary outcome is not clearly established. Secondary outcomes 
regarding  opioids  favour Exparel  over  placebo  but  the  multiplicity  was  not  accounted  for.  The  overall 
difference in opioid consumption is driven by the difference in the first 24 hours, after which it becomes 
similar in both groups. Taken together these results suggest some clinical benefit of Exparel over placebo 
in the studied setting, but the benefit seems limited to the first 24 hours and the results are not robust. 
Study 317 (bunionectomy); Exparel 106 mg vs placebo; primary outcome AUC0-24 of the NRS-
R 
The observed difference in AUC0-24 of NRS-R was -22.3 points (95% CI: -34.8, -9.8) in the Exparel 106 
mg group compared to placebo. This translates into a reduction in AUC of NRS of 15.3% over 24 hours 
in  Exparel  group,  with is  consistent  with  all  population  values  between  a  reduction  of  23.8%  and  the 
reduction  of  6.7%  seen  in  Exparel  compared  to  placebo  when  considering  the  width  of  the  95%  CI. 
Hypothesis testing yielded a p-value of 0.0005, meaning that the probability of observing such results if 
there  was  no  difference  between  treatments  was  very  small.  When  presented  as  the  time-averaged 
difference in pain intensity scores, this corresponds to a reduction of 0.93, which is, at best, of borderline 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 114/147 
 
  
 
 
 
 
clinical relevance. Regarding pain intensity, 95% CIs of Mean pain intensity scores of Exparel and placebo 
start to overlap from 8 hours onwards. 
Secondary outcomes related to opioids through 24 hours favour Exparel with statistically significant p-
values.  However,  when  considering  absolute  numbers,  the  results  are  not  robustly  clinically  relevant. 
The benefit in consumption of rescue medication in Exparel groups translates into 1 less tablet of 5 mg 
oxycodone/325 mg paracetamol FDC through 24 hours, which is consistent with all population values in 
the range of 1.6 less tablets to 0.2 less tablets in Exparel group. In Exparel group 6.2% more patients 
remained  opioid-free  through  24  hours,  but  the  absolute  numbers  are  small  (7  patients  opioid-free 
through 24 hours in Exaprel and only 1 in placebo group) leading to a wide 95% CI that crosses zero 
representing the large uncertainty in the population value. Median time to first use of rescue medication 
is 2.9 hours shorter in Exparel group compared to placebo. 
Additional 5 patients (5.1%) who were rescue-free at 24 hours in Exparel group required an opioid rescue 
from 24-72 hours, while in placebo group no additional patients required rescue medications from 24-
72 hours. 
In summary, clinical relevance of the primary outcome is not clearly established. Secondary outcomes 
regarding opioids favour Exparel over placebo but even with an inflated chance of observing a type I 
error, the results are hardly clinically relevant.  
Study 323, Part 2 (TKA); Exparel 266 mg vs placebo; primary outcome: AUC0-72 of the NRS-
R 
The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 323, AUC of NRS-R from 0 to 72 hours, was 96.5 points lower in 
the Exparel 266 mg group than the placebo group (95% CI -144, -49; p<0.0001). This translates to an 
18.7%  reduction  in  Exparel  group;  when  considering  the  width  of  the  95%  CI,  we  can  expect  the 
population value of AUC NRS-R0-72 to be in the range from a 27.9% reduction to a 9.5% reduction in 
Exparel group compared to placebo. The time-averaged difference in pain intensity scores is 1.3 points 
over 72 hours. These results are clinically relevant. 
Significantly less opioids were consumed in the Exparel arm through 72 hours – the ratio of geometric 
LS means of total opioids through 72 hours in Exparel: placebo groups is 0.74 (95% CI 0.6, 0.9; p-value 
0.0016). This corresponds to a reduction of 26.3%, and when considering the width of the 95% CI the 
result  is  consistent  with  all  values  in  the  range  of  40%  reduction  to  a  10%  reduction  in  Exparel  arm 
through 72 hours. These results are also clinically relevant. However, the reduction in the total use of 
opioids in Exparel vs placebo was mainly driven by the difference in the first 24 hours (the difference for 
0-24h is 13.82 mg; the difference for 24-48h is 6.21 mg and for 48-72 mg the difference is 4.19 mg). 
Other outcomes related to opioids were not clinically relevant - all patients in both groups received opioid 
rescue pain medication by 6.6 hours post-dose; time to first opioid was also similar for both treatment 
arms. 
In summary, overall clinically relevant results from Study 323 are AUC of pain intensity scores through 
72 hours and total opioids through 72 hours, although the latter is driven by the difference observed in 
the  first  24-48  hours.  Other  opioid  related  endpoints  (proportion  of  opioid-free  patients,  time  to  first 
opioid) are not clinically relevant. 
Study  327  (total  shoulder  arthroplasty/rotator  cuff  repair  [TSA/RCR]);  Exparel  133  mg  vs 
placebo; primary outcome: AUC0-48 of the VAS 
The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 327, AUC of VAS from 0 to 48 hours (AUC VAS0-48) was 117.7 
points lower in the Exparel 133 mg group than the placebo group (95% CI -150.9, -84.5; p<0.0001). 
This translates to a 46.3% reduction in Exparel group; when considering the width of the 95% CI, we 
can expect the population value of AUC VAS0-48 to be in the range from a 59.4% reduction to a 33.3% 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020

reduction in Exparel group compared to placebo. Time-averaged difference in pain intensity scores of 
2.5 points over 48 hours. These results are clinically relevant. 
All  results  regarding  opioids  favour  Exparel  and  are  clinically  relevant  –  a  reduction  in  total  opioids 
through 48 hours of 77.2% was observed in Exparel arm, consistent with all population values in the 
range of an 87% reduction to a 60% reduction in Exparel arm. Other secondary outcomes related to 
opioids also favour Exparel – proportion of opioid-free patients through 48 hours (13% vs 1.4%) and 
time to first rescue through 48 hours (4.2 vs 0.6 hours). 
However,  additional  12  patients  (17.4%)  who  were  opioid-free  through  24  hours  in  Exparel  group 
required an opioid from 24-72 hours, while in placebo group no additional patients required opioids from 
24-72 hours. This can be interpreted as initially favourable effect of Exparel being lost or even becoming 
unfavourable after 24 hours. 
Overall, all primary and key secondary results in Study 327 show a clinically relevant effect in favour of 
Exparel through 48 hours.  
The  supportive  studies  with  an  add-on  design  (331  and  411)  will  be  briefly  mentioned  since  the 
interpretation of the results is hampered by internal validity issues and firm conclusion can’t be made. 
The results from Study 331 are not clinically relevant with the exception of total opioid use through 48 
hours. Primary efficacy outcome (total opioids used) in Study 411 is no longer statistically significant if 
all randomised and treated patients are included.  
Overall, in the majority of main Phase 3 studies all or nearly all patients required opioid rescue through 
72 hours.  
In  the  initial  assessment,  it  was  stated  that  some  aspects  of  reduction  in  the  use  of  opioids  warrant 
further discussion – e.g. does the observed reduction in total opioid use translate into less opioid-related 
adverse events, less prolonged opioid use and less opioid dependence. The applicant failed to provide a 
thorough  discussion  on  this  topic,  stating  that  none  of  the  Exparel  clinical  studies  were  designed  or 
powered to assess how reductions in opioid consumption would translate into reductions in opioid-related 
adverse events. The applicant relies on literature data supporting that reductions in opioid use can be 
expected  to  provide  clinical  benefits  to  patients  since  many  opioid-related  adverse  events  are  dose 
related (Wheeler et al, 2002; Zhao et al, 2004). This is acknowledged; however, due to large reduction 
in the use of opioids observed in some studies, it was reasonable to expect a reduction in opioid-related 
adverse  effects  in  those  studies.  However,  although  PONV-free  time,  use  of  antiemetics  and 
postoperative constipation through 72 hours were all pre-defined as other efficacy outcomes in Study 
316, no difference between treatment arms was observed regardless of the significant reduction in the 
amount opioids used in Exparel arm. Similarly, in Study 331, patient’s perception of pain intensity and 
opioid-related  adverse  effects  (OBAS  questionnaire)  was  similar  in  both  groups  regardless  of  the 
significant reduction in the amount of opioids used in Exparel arm. 
In  summary,  studies  316  and  317  remained  as  studies  that  reached  their  primary  endpoint  in  local 
analgesia setting. Results from Study 316 suggest some clinical benefit of Exparel over placebo in the 
studied setting, but the benefit seems limited to the first 24 hours and the results are not very robust. 
Results from Study 317 suggest minor clinical benefit of Exparel over placebo in the studied setting over 
24 hours. Clinical relevance of opioid-related outcomes remains unproven. 
Studies 323 and 327 remained as studies that reached their primary endpoint in regional analgesia 
setting. Overall clinically relevant results from Study 323 are AUC of pain intensity scores through 72 
hours and total opioids through 72 hours, although the latter is driven by the difference observed in the 
first 24-48 hours. Other opioid related endpoints are not clinically relevant. All primary and key secondary 
results in Study 327 show a clinically relevant effect in favour of Exparel through 48 hours.

In  general,  harder  to  treat  patients  were  excluded  from  phase  3  trials.  Generalisability  to  the  EU 
population was discussed by the applicant. Since statistically significant lower pain scores in the first day 
after orthopaedic surgery are noted and less opioids are used in European countries compared to the 
US,  benefits  seen  in  clinical  studies  with  Exparel  can  be  expected  to  be  smaller  in  everyday  clinical 
practice in Europe.  
Dose-effect relationship is not entirely consistent across studies. 
Indication  
The initially proposed indication was unacceptable for several reasons. The claim “reduction in need for 
opioids” relates to study endpoints, rather than condition to be treated and therefore was removed from 
the indication. It is also unacceptable to include comparisons with other medicinal product so original 
proposal to compare Exparel to IV bupivacaine was removed as well.  
Furthermore, CHMP concluded that the indication of Exparel should be based on results from those pivotal 
studies that reached statistical significance.  
In relation to the nerve block indication, it was agreed to focus the indication on the type of the nerve 
block itself rather than the type of the surgery. In that respect, efficacy and safety are considered to be 
shown  for  interscalene  brachial  plexus  and  femoral  nerve  block.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss 
further if extrapolation to other types of peripheral nerve blocks would be justified. The generalisability 
from interscalene brachial plexus block to other subtypes of brachial plexus block can be supported. The 
proposed indication for nerve block includes also femoral nerve block without extrapolation to other types 
of peripheral nerve blocks, which is agreed. 
In  relation  to  the  field  block  indication,  it  was  agreed  to  limit  the  indication  based  on  the  size  of  the 
surgical wound, since statistically significant pivotal studies were performed in small to medium-sized 
surgeries. The applicant provided a list of examples of other small to medium-sized surgeries where the 
product could be used based on the same field block technique as in Studies 316 and 317.  
The final indication was agreed as follows: Exparel liposomal is indicated as a brachial plexus block or 
femoral nerve block for treatment of postoperative pain in adults, and as a field block for treatment of 
somatic postoperative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults (see section 5.1). 
In addition, the following was placed in the Section 4.4 of SmPC:  
Efficacy and safety have not been established in major abdominal, vascular and thoracic surgeries. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Exparel  clinical  development  programme  included  pain  models  only  in  the  post-surgical  setting.  The 
majority of pain models were of somatic pain with only 2 studies in a mixed somatic and visceral pain 
(one  in  thoracic  and  one  in  abdominal  surgery).  However,  studies  in  thoracic  and  abdominal  surgery 
were not supportive of the claimed indication, since the thoracic surgery study yielded negative results 
and  the  supportive  abdominal  surgery  study  was  of  add-on  design  and  is  of  limited  value  due  to 
methodological issues.  
The  clinical  development  programme  was  broad  and  lengthy,  with  some  of  the  main  Phase  3  studies 
completed more than 10 year ago. Although robust and consistent results were not observed across the 
entire phase 3 programme, several of Phase 3 studies have shown clinically relevant results.  
Based on the overall clinical programme and the lack of robustness of the results, extrapolation to all 
local  analgesia  and  all  regional  analgesia  settings  was  not  supported.  The  final  indication  is  primarily 
based on the 4 studies that demonstrated clinical efficacy and clinical relevance.

Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Across  35  studies  in  the  Exparel  clinical  development  programme,  a  total  of  2321  individuals  were 
exposed to Exparel (612 healthy subjects in Phase 1 studies, 18 special population subjects in a Phase 
1 study, and 1645 subjects in the intended target population in Phase 1, 2 and Phase 3 studies) at doses 
ranging from 9 to 665 mg. 
Table 29 
Safety  data  are  summarised  using  the  Safety  Population  from  each  respective  study,  defined  as  all 
enrolled subjects who received at least one (full or partial) dose of study medication according to the 
actual treatment received. 
Table 30 
Combined Pool 
The  Combined  Pool  includes  all  21  studies  in  the  Exparel  clinical  development  programme  that  were 
conducted in local and regional analgesia for the management of acute pain. This pool is used to evaluate 
the  overall  safety  profile  of  Exparel  in  adults  for  the  proposed  indication.  Of  the  21  studies  in  the 
Combined Pool, 2 (117 and 118) were PK and tolerability studies, one (211) was a dose-finding study, 
seven (316, 317, 322, 323, 326, 327, and 329) were placebo-controlled studies, and 11 (201, 203, 207, 
208, 209, 210, 311, 312, 315, 331, and 411) were active-controlled studies. The studies were conducted 
in a variety of surgical models across a range of Exparel doses from 66 mg to 532 mg. Surgical models 
include breast augmentation, bunionectomy, haemorrhoidectomy, hernia repair, open posterior spinal 
fusion or reconstructive surgery, RCR/TSA, third molar extraction, thoracotomy, and TKA.

Local Analgesia Pool 
The Local Analgesia Pool includes all 14 studies in the Exparel clinical development programme that were 
conducted in local analgesia for the management of acute pain. This pool is used to evaluate the safety 
profile of Exparel when used as a field block to provide local analgesia in adult subjects. 
Of  the  14  studies  in  the  Local  Analgesia  Pool,  one  (117)  was  a  single-arm,  open-label  PK  and  initial 
tolerability study, three (316, 317, and 329) were placebo-controlled studies, and ten (201, 207, 208, 
209, 210, 311, 312, 315, 331, and 411) were active-controlled studies. In two studies (331 and 411), 
Exparel was admixed with IR bupivacaine, with IR bupivacaine also used as an active comparator. 
The studies were conducted in a variety of surgical models across a range of Exparel doses from 66 mg 
to  532  mg.  Surgical  models  include  breast  augmentation,  bunionectomy,  haemorrhoidectomy,  hernia 
repair, open posterior spinal fusion or reconstructive surgery, third molar extraction, and TKA. 
Regional Analgesia Pool 
The Regional Analgesia Pool includes all seven studies in the Exparel clinical development programme 
that were conducted in regional analgesia for the management of acute pain. This pool is used to evaluate 
the safety profile of Exparel when used as a peripheral nerve block to provide regional analgesia in adult 
subjects. Of the seven studies in the Regional Analgesia Pool, one (118) was a single-arm, open-label 
PK and tolerability study, four (322, 323, 326, and 327) were placebo-controlled studies, and two (203 
and  211)  were  active-controlled  studies.  The  studies  were  conducted  in  a  variety  of  surgical  models 
across a range of Exparel doses from 66 mg to 310 mg. Surgical models include bunionectomy, RCR/TSA, 
posterolateral thoracotomy, and TKA. 
Demographic and Other Characteristics of the Study Population 
Local Analgesia Pool  
In the Local Analgesia Pool, most subjects were <65 years of age, had an ASA class of 1-2, and were 
white. Most subjects were from the US, although approximately 17% of subjects were from the EU. The 
distribution of males and females varied across the Exparel dose groups due to the underlying subject 
populations of some of the studies, but both male and female subjects were represented in each dosing 
group. 
Regional Analgesia pool  
In the Regional Analgesia Pool, 55% of subjects were <65 years of age, approximately 70% of subjects 
had an ASA class of 1-2, and most subjects were white. Approximately 55% of subjects in the Regional 
Analgesia Pool were from the US and approximately 42% of subjects were from the EU. The distribution 
of sex by group was similar for the all Exparel and placebo groups, but there was a higher proportion of 
females than males in the IR bupivacaine group. 
So, the presented exposure to Exparel is rather extensive. Overall, the safety database includes a total 
of 2321 individuals exposed to Exparel (including 612 healthy subjects in Phase 1 studies and 18 special 
population subjects in a Phase 1 study) at doses ranging from 9 to 665 mg. 
1645 patients were exposed to Exparel in the combined pool (1109 patients were exposed to EXPAERL 
in LA pool and 536 in RA pool). In the combined pool most of patients were 40 – 65 years old (44.1%), 
slightly  lower  exposure  to  Exparel  was  in  patients  <  40  years  (27.2%)  and  65-75  years  (21.1%), 
significantly  lower  exposure  to  Exparel  was  in  the  age  >  75  years.  Similar  demographic  trends  were 
reported in IR bupivacaine and placebo groups. There was a difference in the age distribution between 
RA and LA pools. Patients were significantly younger in LA pool compared to RA pool. This may be due 
to  the  type  of  surgery.    Also,  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  was  exposed  to  Exparel  in  the  LA  pool 
(1109)  compared  to  RA  pool  (536).  Due  to  the  much  higher  importance  of  LA  in  postoperative  pain

management it is understood why only 536 subjects in RA pool vs 1109 in LA pool were exposed. No 
paediatric patients were studied yet.

Table 33: Overall summary of TEAE by Relationship to study drug (Combined pool) 
Local Analgesia Pool 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was lower for the All Exparel (66.0%) when compared with IR bupivacaine 
(70.2%),  and  higher  than  the  placebo  group  (56.3%).  The  incidence  of  TESAEs  was  higher  in  the  IR 
bupivacaine  group  (4.0%)  than  the  All  Exparel  (2.7%)  and  placebo  (0.8%)  groups.  The  incidence  of 
related TEAEs was lower in the IR bupivacaine group (10.4%) than in the All Exparel (17.6%) and placebo 
(25.5%) groups. The incidence of severe TEAEs was also higher in the IR bupivacaine group (5.1%) than 
the All Exparel (4.6%) and placebo (2.4%) groups. There were 3 or fewer TEAEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation in all groups. There were two deaths reported in the Local Analgesia Pool (one subject in 
the Exparel 532 mg group and one subject in the IR bupivacaine 150 mg group) that were not considered 
related to study drug. 
There was a higher incidence of TEAEs and related TEAEs in the Exparel 133 mg group than in the other 
dose groups. Study-level comparisons between Exparel 133 mg and the respective comparator group(s) 
in  each  relevant  study  (i.e.,  placebo  or  IR  bupivacaine)  determined  that  there  were  no  meaningful 
differences between the Exparel and comparator groups at the study level.  
In  Study  209,  there  was  a  lower  incidence  of  subjects  who  experienced  at  least  one  TEAE  in  the  All 
Exparel  group  (20.3%)  compared  to  IR  bupivacaine  (42.3%).  In  Study  317,  a  higher  proportion  of 
subjects reported TEAEs in the placebo group (67.7%) compared to the All Exparel group (59.8%). In 
Study 331, a higher proportion of subjects reported TEAEs in the Exparel+bupivacaine group (64.3%) 
compared to the IR bupivacaine group (56.5%). In Study 411, a higher proportion of subjects reported 
TEAEs in the Exparel+bupivacaine group (63.9%) compared to the IR bupivacaine group (56.2%). In all 
other studies, the percentage of subjects with at least one TEAE was similar between groups. 
Regional Analgesia Pool 
Of the 914 subjects in the Regional Analgesia Pool, only 21 subjects received IR bupivacaine; thus, the 
sample  size  of  the  IR  bupivacaine  group  may  not  provide  enough  sensitivity  to  make  a  meaningful 
comparison.  
The incidence of TESAEs was similar between the All Exparel (8.2%) and placebo (8.1%) groups. The 
incidence of related TEAEs was higher in the All Exparel group (14.0%) when compared with placebo 
(9.5%).  
The incidence of severe TEAEs was higher in the placebo group (7.8%) than in the All Exparel (5.4%). 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was higher in the placebo group (2.0%) 
than  in  the  All  E  There  were  six  deaths  reported  in  the  Regional  Analgesia  Pool.  No  TEAEs  leading  to 
study drug discontinuation or death were reported in the IR bupivacaine group. No clear dose-related 
trends were observed among subjects who received Exparel. There was a higher incidence of TEAEs and 
related TEAEs in the Exparel <133 mg and 133 mg groups than in the other dose groups. Study-level 
comparisons between Exparel <133 mg and 133 mg and the respective comparator group(s) in each 
relevant study (i.e., placebo or IR bupivacaine) determined that there were no meaningful differences 
between the Exparel and comparator groups at the study level. In general, the overall incidence of TEAEs 
in the Regional Analgesia Pool was higher than the incidence of TEAEs in the Local Analgesia Pool in both

the Exparel 266 mg and the placebo groups. This is due in large part to the different surgeries evaluated 
in field block studies versus nerve block studies and their corresponding patient populations.  
The  Regional  Analgesia  Pool  included older  subjects with  a  mean  age  approximately  of  63  years  who 
tended  to  be  more  complicated  patients  undergoing  thoracotomy,  TKA,  bunionectomy,  and  RCR/TSA 
compared with the Local Analgesia Pool, which included subjects with a mean age of approximately 47 
years who were typically undergoing less invasive procedures. 
 A  higher  percentage  of  Exparel-treated  subjects  (59.6%)  versus  placebo-treated  (40.5%)  subjects 
experienced  TEAEs  in  Study  322  (posterolateral  thoracotomy).  The  highest  incidence  of  TEAEs  was 
reported in the two TKA studies (323 and 326). 
Vital Signs 
There were no clinically relevant differences in vital sign results between the All Exparel, IR bupivacaine, 
and placebo groups when assessed as either absolute values, change from baseline, or shifts from normal 
at baseline to values outside the normal range following treatment for the Combined Pool, Local Analgesia 
Pool, and Regional Analgesia Pool. 
Electrocardiograms 
The effect of Exparel on ECG parameters has been evaluated in two QT studies in healthy volunteers at 
supra-therapeutic doses as well as with ECG monitoring in all Exparel clinical studies.  
Overall, both thorough QT studies found no effect of therapeutic or supra-therapeutic doses of Exparel 
on cardiac repolarisation. 
Combined Pool 
The percentage of subjects with a post-treatment ECG interpreted as clinically significant abnormal was 
3.5% in the All Exparel group, 3.9% in the IR bupivacaine group, and 0% in the placebo group in the 
Combined  Pool.  Study  323  collected  normal  or  abnormal  (no  further  interpretation  regarding  clinical 
significance); the percentage of subjects with a post-treatment ECG interpreted as abnormal was 32.7% 
in  the  All  Exparel  and  placebo  groups.  Additionally,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  a  normal  ECG  at 
baseline and an abnormal ECG post-treatment (either not clinically significant or PCS) was similar among 
the treatment groups and no relationship with Exparel dose was observed.  
Local Analgesia Pool 
The percentage of subjects with a post-treatment ECG interpreted as clinically significant abnormal was 
7.8% in the All Exparel group,3.4% in the IR bupivacaine group, and 0% in the placebo group in the 
Local Analgesia Pool. In Study 323, the percentage of subjects with a post-treatment ECG interpreted 
as abnormal was 3.7% in the All Exparel and 3.4% in the placebo group. 
Additionally,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  a  normal  ECG  at  baseline  and  an  abnormal  ECG  post-
treatment  (either  not  clinically  significant  or  PCS)  was  similar  among  the  treatment  groups  and  no 
relationship with Exparel dose was observed.  
Regional Analgesia Pool 
The percentage of subjects with a post-treatment ECG interpreted as clinically significant abnormal was 
0.5% in the All Exparel group, 5.3% in the IR bupivacaine group, and 0% in the placebo group in the 
Regional Analgesia Pool. In Study 323, the percentage of subjects with a post-treatment ECG interpreted 
as abnormal was 29.0% in the All Exparel and 29.3% in the placebo group. Additionally, the percentage 
of  subjects  with  a  normal  ECG  at  baseline  and  an  abnormal  ECG  post-treatment  (either  not  clinically 
significant or PCS) was similar among the treatment groups and no relationship with Exparel dose was 
observed.

Electrocardiogram and Holter Results from Studies 322 and 323 
Holter  recordings  were  collected  in  Studies  322  and  323,  and  these  recordings  have  undergone 
substantial  additional  review  and  analyses.  There  were  no  clinically  relevant  imbalances  between  the 
active  study  drug  (liposome  bupivacaine)  and  placebo  for  heart  rate  range,  supraventricular  or 
ventricular arrhythmias or bradycardic arrhythmias including sinus pauses> 3 sec; AV block, or mean 
low heart rate. 
Wound Status and Wound Healing 
Wound status was assessed in four Phase 2 studies (Study 201, Study 207, Study 208, Study 210) and 
three  Phase  3  studies  (Study  311,  Study  315,  Study  317).  A  blinded  health  care  provider  assessed 
erythema, drainage, oedema, and induration using a structured scale for each type of assessment on 
Day 8 or Day 10, and on Day 30 or Day 36, depending on the study. There were no clinically meaningful 
differences  between  the  Exparel  and  comparator  (IR  bupivacaine  or  placebo)  groups  in  wound  status 
assessments at any time point. Detailed results can be found in the CSR for each study. Satisfaction with 
wound healing was assessed in three Phase 2 studies (Study 207, Study 208, Study 210) and four Phase 
3  studies  (Study  311,  Study  315,  Study  316,  Study  317).  A  blinded  care  provider  assessed  their 
satisfaction with wound healing using a 10-point Likert scale on Day 8 or Day 10, and on Day 30 or Day 
36,  depending  on  the  study.  In  all  studies,  mean  wound  healing  satisfaction  scores  were  high  in  the 
Exparel and comparator (IR bupivacaine or placebo) groups at all time points. Detailed results can be 
found in the CSR for each study. 
TEAEs Specific to Regional Analgesia 
The applicant has discussed TEAEs: falls and sensory and motor function relating to regional analgesia 
separately.  According  to  the  applicant,  the  consequences  of  sensory  and  motor  loss  have  broader 
implications  on  mobility  and  other  functions.  Targeting  more  proximal  nerves  introduces  the  need  to 
assess the relative differences in effect on sensory and motor blockade. 
In the Regional Analgesia Pool, the incidence of fall was 2.2% in the All Exparel group and 0.3% in the 
placebo  group.  The  incidence  of  fall  was  similar  in  the  Exparel  133  mg  (2.4%)  and  Exparel  266  mg 
(2.6%) groups. All TEAEs of fall among Exparel subjects in the regional analgesia programme occurred 
in the TKA studies (323 and 326); the single fall among placebo subjects occurred in the TSA/RCR study 
(327).  Sensory  and  motor  function  loss  and  return with  Exparel  were  assessed  in two  clinical  studies 
(326 and 327).  
As  almost  all  reported  falls  are  attributable  to  regional  analgesia  setting  in  TKA,  this  setting  bears 
additional safety concern. Sensory and motor functions were assessed in 2 studies, Phase 3 (TKA and 
TSA/RCR). Persistent loss of function was not reported. The applicant provided graphical presentations 
of results (please refer to Clinical AR), but all x-axis variables are shown to 192 hours, while assessments 
were performed until Day 10, and motor loss in Study 327 has not been shown. There was no evidence 
of long-term sensory loss. Sensory loss was dose-dependent according to one study (326). There were 
difficulties in assessment of motor function due to immobilisation following surgery and willingness to 
perform the function test according to the applicant. However, motor loss is worrisome and it is noticed 
during  early  phases  of  clinical  development  that  it  was  not  dose-dependent,  rather  variable  between 
doses of Exparel. 
Presented findings are put in the context of effects on ability to drive and use machines as the effects 
were shown to last longer than for up to 72 hours.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 125/147 
 
  
 
 
Across  the  21  clinical  studies,  eight  deaths  were  reported:  three  subjects  with  Exparel  (0.2%),  one 
subject with IR bupivacaine (0.2%), and four subjects with placebo (0.7%).  
Combined Pool 
A TEAE leading to death occurred in eight subjects in the clinical development programme. Of the eight 
deaths, three occurred in the All Exparel group, one in the IR bupivacaine group, and four in the placebo 
group\. Two deaths (one Exparel, one IR bupivacaine) occurred in Study 208 (TKA); both were deemed 
by  the  study  investigator  as  not  related  to  the  study  drug.    Six  deaths  (two  Exparel,  four  placebo) 
occurred  in  Study  322  in  the  setting  of  posterolateral  thoracotomy,  which  was  the  most  invasive 
procedure evaluated in the development programme; all were considered by the study investigator as 
not related to the study drug. No deaths were reported in Phase 1 and Phase 4 studies of Exparel. 
Fatal adverse events were reported for eight subjects.  Three subjects died in Exparel group, one in LA 
group  and  two  in  RA  group.    As  for  all  deaths  no  relationship  to  study  drug  has  been  found  by 
investigators.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
The percentage of subjects in the Combined Pool experiencing at least one TESAE was similar for the All 
Exparel group (74/1645 [4.5%]) compared to the IR bupivacaine group (24/625 [3.8%]) and the placebo 
group  (31/604  [5.1%]).  No  individual  TESAE  occurred  with  an  incidence  of  ≥0.5%  in  the  All  Exparel 
group and no dose-related trends with Exparel were observed. None of the TESAEs in any group was 
considered by the investigator as being related to study drug. 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were rare in the clinical programme. Four subjects who received 
Exparel (0.2%) and 8 subjects who received placebo (1.3%) discontinued due to a TEAE. None of the 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation in any group was considered by the investigator as being related 
to study drug. 
Combined Pool 
The percentage of subjects in the Combined Pool experiencing a TESAE was similar for the All Exparel 
(4.5%) group compared to IR bupivacaine (3.8%) and placebo (5.1%). No individual TESAE occurred 
with  an  incidence  of  ≥0.5%  in  the  All  Exparel  group.  None  of  the  TESAEs  was  considered  by  the 
investigator as being related to Exparel. No meaningful differences in the incidence of individual TESAEs 
were observed among the All Exparel, IR bupivacaine, and placebo groups, and no Exparel dose-related 
trends were observed. 
Local Analgesia Pool 
The percentage of subjects in the Local Analgesia Pool experiencing at least one TESAE was lower for 
the All Exparel (2.7%) group when compared to IR bupivacaine (4.0%) and higher than placebo (0.8%). 
No individual TESAE occurred with an incidence of ≥0.5% in the All Exparel group. None of the TESAEs 
was considered by the investigator as being related to Exparel. No meaningful differences in the incidence 
of different TESAEs were observed among the All Exparel, IR bupivacaine, and placebo groups, and no 
Exparel dose-related trends were observed. 
The incidence of TESAEs was similar among the All Exparel, IR bupivacaine, and placebo groups in Study 
311. 
Regional Analgesia Pool 
The percentage of subjects in the Regional Analgesia Pool experiencing at least one TESAE was similar 
for the All Exparel group (8.2%) compared to placebo (8.1%), with both groups being higher than IR 
bupivacaine (0.0%). No individual TESAE occurred with an incidence of 1.0% or higher in the All Exparel 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020

group.  None  of  the  TESAEs  was  considered  by  the  investigator  as  being  related  to  study  drug.  No 
meaningful differences in the incidence of different TESAEs were observed between the All Exparel and 
placebo groups, and no Exparel dose-related trends were observed. The limited sample size of the IR 
bupivacaine  group  in  the  Regional  Analgesia  Pool  precludes  meaningful  interpretations  of  the  relative 
frequency of rare events such as TESAEs. 
Most TESAEs occurred in Study 322 in posterolateral thoracotomy, which was the most invasive surgery 
evaluated in the clinical programme. The incidence of TESAEs was similar between the All Exparel and 
placebo groups. 
The rate of SAEs was low in each of the treatment groups. Percentage of subjects experiencing at least 
one  serious  TEAE  was  similar  across  treatment  groups  (4.5%  Exparel  ALL  Dose  group  vs  3.8%  IR 
bupivacaine group and 5.1% placebo). The highest number of serious TEAEs was reported in study 311 
for  TKA  surgery  (9.8%  in  Exparel  group  vs  12.2%  in  IR  bupivacaine  group)  and  study  208  for  TKA 
surgery (4.8% in Exparel group vs 8.8% in IR bupivacaine group). As such, it was concluded that the 
Exparel group was superior to the IR bupivacaine group in terms of having lower proportion of subjects 
with serious TEAEs.  
Laboratory findings 
In  the  Combined  Pool,  there  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  between  the  All  Exparel,  IR 
bupivacaine,  and  placebo  groups  for  haematology  or  clinical  chemistry  laboratory  parameters  when 
assessed as either absolute values, change from baseline, or shifts from normal at baseline to values 
outside the normal range following treatment. No dose-related trends with Exparel were observed for 
any laboratory abnormality. There was also no hepatotoxicity signal observed and no cases in any group 
that met Hy’s law criteria for drug-induced liver injury.  
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
Age 
In  the  Combined  Pool,  approximately  40-50%  of  All  Exparel  (726/1645,  44.1%),  IR  bupivacaine 
(260/625, 41.6%), and placebo (309/604, 51.2%) subjects were aged 40 to <65 years. The next largest 
age group was subjects aged <40 years, with 448/1645 All Exparel (27.2%), 228/625 IR bupivacaine 
(36.5%), and 129/604 placebo (21.4%) subjects in the Combined Pool. The remaining subjects were in 
the 65 to <75 years (21.2% All Exparel, 15.5% IR bupivacaine, and 20.4% placebo), 75 to <85 years 
(7.1% All Exparel, 5.9% IR bupivacaine, and 6.5% placebo), and ≥85 years (0.3% All Exparel, 0.5% IR 
bupivacaine, and 0.7% placebo) age categories. In the Combined Pool, the proportions of subjects with 
TEAEs, severe TEAEs, or TESAEs were somewhat lower in subjects <65 years of age than in those ≥65 
years of age for the All Exparel, IR bupivacaine, and placebo groups and. A small number of subjects 
had a TEAE leading to discontinuation or death, making it difficult to draw conclusions concerning age-
related patterns across the treatment groups. As would be expected, falls were more commonly reported 
among older subjects. Of the 16 subjects in the All Exparel groups who had a TEAE of fall, six were aged 
40  to  <65  years  (0.8%),  five  were  aged  65  to  <75  years  (1.4%),  four  were  aged  75  to  <85  years 
(3.4%), and one was aged ≥85 years (20.0%). 
Of the 1109 subjects who received Exparel in the Local Analgesia Pool, 214 subjects were ≥65 years of 
age and 59 subjects were ≥75 years of age. Of the 536 subjects who received Exparel in the Regional 
Analgesia Pool, 255 subjects were ≥65 years of age and 63 subjects were ≥75 years of age. No adverse 
drug-related effects with Exparel were observed related to older age. Clinical experience with Exparel 
has  not  identified  differences  in  efficacy  or  safety  between  elderly  and  younger  patients,  but  greater 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 127/147 
 
  
 
 
 
sensitivity  of  some  older  individuals  cannot  be  ruled  out.  In  clinical  studies,  differences  in  various  PK 
parameters have been observed between elderly and younger individuals. Bupivacaine is known to be 
substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to bupivacaine may be greater in 
patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal 
function, care should be taken in dose selection of Exparel. 
Sex 
In the Combined Pool, there were greater percentages of female than males in the All Exparel (890/1645, 
54.1%  vs.  755/1645,  45.9%),  IR  bupivacaine  (414/625,  66.2%  vs.  211/625,  33.8%),  and  placebo 
(322/604,  53.3%  vs.  282/604,  46.7%)  groups.  There  were  no  clinically  significant  differences  in  the 
proportions  of  subjects  with  TEAEs,  severe  TEAEs,  or  TESAEs  between  males  and  females  for  the  All 
Exparel, IR bupivacaine, and placebo groups. 
Race 
Most subjects in the Combined Pool (1416/1645, 86.1% All Exparel, 529/625, 84.6% IR bupivacaine, 
527/604,  87.3%  placebo)  were  white.  Therefore,  the  conclusions  that  can  be  drawn  concerning  the 
impact of race on the TEAE profile are limited. Nevertheless, there were no apparent differences in the 
proportions of subjects with TEAEs, severe TEAEs, or TESAEs among subjects who were white compared 
with those who were not white. 
ASA Class 
In  the  Combined  Pool,  the  majority  of  subjects  (1171/1645,  71.2%  All  Exparel,  497/625,  79.5%  IR 
bupivacaine, 435/604, 72.0% placebo) had a baseline ASA Class of 1-2. As expected, the proportion of 
subjects with TEAEs or TESAEs was higher in subjects with baseline ASA Class 3-4 than in those with a 
baseline ASA Class 1-2 but no clinically significant differences were noted among the treatment groups 
and  no  clinically  significant  difference  as  a  function  of  ASA  class  was  observed  in  the  proportion  of 
subjects with a TEAE leading to discontinuation or death. Of the 16 Exparel-treated subjects who had a 
TEAE of fall, ten had an ASA Class 3-4 at baseline. 
Renal Impairment 
Bupivacaine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be 
greater  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  function.  This  should  be  considered  when  performing  dose 
selection of Exparel. 
Hepatic Impairment 
Amide-type local anaesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolised by the liver. Patients with severe 
hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolise local aesthetics normally, are at a greater risk 
of developing toxic plasma concentrations, and potentially local anaesthetic systemic toxicity. Therefore, 
consider increased monitoring for local anaesthetic systemic toxicity in subjects with moderate-to-severe 
hepatic disease. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Given that Exparel is intended for single administration as a field block or as a peripheral nerve block, 
external factors such as tobacco use, alcohol use, and food habits are not expected to have an impact 
on safety. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug Interactions 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020

Using  Exparel  followed  by  other  bupivacaine  formulations  has  not  been  studied  in  clinical  trials. 
Formulations  of  bupivacaine  other  than  should  not  be  administered  within  96  hours  following 
administration  of  Exparel.  Some  physicochemical  incompatibilities  exist  between  Exparel  and  certain 
other  drugs.  Direct  contact  of  Exparel  with  these  drugs  results  in  a  rapid  increase  in  free 
(unencapsulated) bupivacaine, altering Exparel characteristics and potentially affecting the safety and 
efficacy  of  Exparel.  Therefore,  admixing  Exparel  with  other  drugs  prior  to  administration  is  not 
recommended. 
• 
The  administration  of  Exparel  may  follow  the  administration  of  lidocaine  after  a  delay  of  20 
minutes or more. Bupivacaine HCl administered together with Exparel may impact the PK and/or 
physicochemical  properties  of  Exparel,  and  this  effect  is  concentration  dependent.  Therefore, 
bupivacaine  HCl  and  Exparel  may  be  administered  simultaneously  in  the  same  syringe,  and 
bupivacaine HCl may be injected immediately before Exparel as long as the ratio of the milligram 
dose of bupivacaine HCl solution to Exparel does not exceed 1:2. If preparing admixture, the 
total amount of bupivacaine used (Exparel liposomal + bupivacaine HCl) should not exceed 400 
mg equivalents of bupivacaine HCl. 
• 
The toxic effects of these drugs are additive, and their administration should be used with caution 
including monitoring for neurologic and CV effects related to local anaesthetic systemic toxicity. 
•  When a topical antiseptic such as povidone iodine (e.g., Betadine®) is applied, the site should 
be allowed to dry before Exparel is administered into the site. Exparel should not be allowed to 
come into contact with antiseptics such as povidone iodine in solution. 
• 
The  administration  of  Exparel  may  follow  the  administration  of  lidocaine  after  a  delay  of  20 
minutes or more. 
•  Studies  conducted  with  Exparel  demonstrated  that  the  most  common  implantable  materials 
(polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, silicone, stainless steel, and titanium) are not affected 
by the presence of Exparel any more than they are by saline. None of the materials studied had 
an adverse effect on Exparel. The toxic effects of local anaesthetics are additive and their co-
administration,  taking  into  account  the  extended  PK  profile  of  Exparel,  should  be  used  with 
caution,  including  monitoring  for  neurologic  and  cardiovascular  effects  related  to  local 
anaesthetic systemic toxicity. 
•  Bupivacaine  other  than  Exparel  should  not  be  administered  within  96  hours  following 
administration of Exparel. Patients that are administered local anaesthetics may be at increased 
risk  of  developing  methaemoglobinemia  when  concurrently  exposed  to  the  following  oxidising 
agents: 
Table 34

Bupivacaine 
Bupivacaine  HCl  administered  together  with  Exparel  may  impact  the  PK  and/or  physicochemical 
properties of Exparel, and this effect is concentration dependent. Therefore, bupivacaine HCl and Exparel 
may  be  administered  simultaneously  in  the  same  syringe,  and  bupivacaine  HCl  may  be  injected 
immediately  before  Exparel  as  long  as  the  ratio  of  the  milligram  dose  of  bupivacaine  HCl  solution  to 
Exparel  does  not  exceed  1:2.  If  preparing  admixture,  the  total  amount  of  bupivacaine  used  (Exparel 
liposomal + bupivacaine HCl) should not exceed 400 mg equivalents of bupivacaine HCl. 
Non-Bupivacaine Local Anaesthetics 
Exparel should not be admixed with local anaesthetics other than bupivacaine. Non-bupivacaine-based 
local  anaesthetics,  including  lidocaine,  may  cause  an  IR  of  bupivacaine  from  Exparel  if  administered 
together locally. The administration of Exparel may follow the administration of lidocaine after a delay of 
20  minutes  or  more.  There  are  no  data  to  support  administration  of  other  local  anaesthetics  prior  to 
administration of Exparel. Other than bupivacaine as noted above, Exparel should not be admixed with 
other drugs prior to administration. 
Evaluable  information  on  interactions  is  limited  to  the  information  provided  for  currently  authorised 
bupivacaine  and  presented  in  the  proposed  Exparel  SmPC.  According  to  the  applicant,  drug-drug 
interaction profile for Exparel was mainly based on known bupivacaine interactions with other medicinal 
products.  In  this  Summary  particular  attention  was  paid  to  potential  incompatibilities  with  liposomal 
bupivacaine formulation resulting in rapid increase of free bupivacaine. Safety information for Exparel 
related to potential drug-drug interactions in this Summary of Clinical Safety is identical to that included 
in the product SmPC.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
Incidence of AEs that Led to Discontinuation from the Study 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were rare in the clinical programme. Four subjects who received 
Exparel (0.2%) and 8 subjects who received placebo (1.3%) discontinued due to a TEAE. None of the 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation in any group was considered by the investigator as being related 
to study drug. 
Combined Pool 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to study discontinuation was low in all groups: 0.2% in the All Exparel 
group, 0.5% in the IR bupivacaine group, and 1.3% in the placebo group.  
Local Analgesia Pool 
There was one (0.9%) TEAE leading to study discontinuation in the All Exparel group, three (0.5%) in 
the IR bupivacaine group, and one (0.4%) in the placebo group.  
Regional Analgesia Pool 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to withdrawal was low in all groups: 0.6% in the All Exparel group, 0.0% 
in the IR bupivacaine group, and 2.0% in the placebo group.  
Number of adverse events leading to discontinuation from investigational product was low in all study 
groups  (0.2%  in  the  All  Exparel  group,  0.5%  in  the  IR  bupivacaine  group,  and  1.3%  in  the  placebo 
group).   
Post marketing experience 
According  to  the  applicant,  the  adverse  reactions  reported  during  post-marketing  are  consistent  with 
those observed in clinical studies and most commonly involve the following SOCs: Injury, Poisoning, and 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020

Procedural Complications (e.g., drug-drug interaction, procedural pain), Nervous System Disorders (e.g., 
palsy, seizure), General Disorders And Administration Site Conditions (e.g., lack of efficacy, pain), Skin 
And  Subcutaneous  Tissue Disorders  (e.g.,  erythema,  rash),  and  Cardiac  Disorders  (e.g.,  bradycardia, 
cardiac arrest). Review of these events against the current approved US labelling for Exparel has not 
identified any new safety concerns and no changes to the product labelling have been required for safety 
reasons since initial approval. 
The applicant has addressed the post-marketing experience, including LAST and lack of efficacy, in the 
product information as requested by the assessors.  
2.6.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The submitted safety results are summarised from all subjects who received study drug in the 21 clinical 
studies (2 Phase 1 studies, 7 Phase 2 studies, and 12 Phase 3 studies – two of which were classified as 
Phase 4 in the US) conducted in the population of adult individuals who underwent a surgical procedure. 
In all 21 studies, subjects were administered a single dose of study drug. Safety data are summarised 
by three safety pools (Combined local and regional analgesia, Local analgesia and Regional analgesia 
pool) and according to the actual treatment received by the subject. 
Safety assessment primarily considering combined pooled analysis set as the experience available from 
all  patients  exposed  is  explored,  the  whole  dose  range  is  of  concern  and  the  same  safety  profile  is 
expected in local and regional analgesia settings. 
Safety  data  set  of  interest  seems  sufficiently  large  to  characterise  a  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of 
liposome bupivacaine (1645 subjects were exposed to single dose of liposome bupivacaine in range of 
doses, 66 to 532 mg through developmental programme; N of subjects exposed to bupivacaine HCl was 
625 (44 to 177 mg); N of subjects exposed to placebo was 604). Drug is intended to be administered as 
a single dose. Total proposed dose of bupivacaine expressed as free base ranges from 106 to 354.6 mg.  
Safety  data  are  collected  from  the  range  of  local  and  regional  analgesia  procedures.  The  target 
population is adequately reflected as initially proposed indication is limited (please refer to the Clinical 
efficacy section).  
Overall, all adult age groups were represented through drug development. 27% of subjects exposed to 
the study drug were in <40 years age group, most (44%) were in 40-65 years age group, 28.5% were 
elderly  subjects  (65-85  years).  There  were  slightly  lesser  male  subjects  when  looking  to  all  doses 
liposome  bupivacaine  data.  Most  of  the  subjects  belonged  to  ASA  class  1-2.  As  discussed  in  clinical 
efficacy sections, the EU safety pool was remarkably smaller (26% EU subjects, 72% US ones). This 
raises a concern regarding cultural differences, differences in subjective dimension of pain sensation and 
regional differences in opioid use. Although total number of TEAEs was lower among EU subjects than 
US  ones,  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  at  least  one  TESAEs,  with  at  least  one  TEAEs  leading  to 
discontinuation of the study and death were higher in the EU than the US population. Participants were 
acceptably  well-balanced  regarding  baseline  body  weight/BMI.  The  applicant  provided  analysis  of 
subjects’  medical  history  with  responses  to  the  D120  LoQ.  Numerous  pre-existing  disorders  reflect 
broad population status. There were some differences in medical history among treatment group, but 
none is considered to substantially influence the safety profile. 
Overall,  percentages  of  subjects  with  at  least  one  TEAE  did  not  differ  among  the  all  doses  liposome 
bupivacaine, bupivacaine HCl and placebo group, and they are overall high (around 72%). In placebo 
group there were higher numbers of subjects with at least one TEAE leading to discontinuation of the 
study  and  death,  but  numbers  are  very  small  to  conclude  actual  difference.  Regarding  other  TEAE 
categories there is also no emergent difference. It is visible, though, from the presented data that 266 
mg and higher doses of liposome bupivacaine were associated with higher numbers of subjects with 
at  least  one  TESAE  and  severe  TEAE,  higher  numbers  of  subjects  with  at  least  one  TEAE  leading  to 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 131/147 
 
  
 
 
discontinuation of the study and death. On the other hand, smaller doses of liposome bupivacaine were 
associated with higher numbers of subject with at least one related TEAE. Recorded numbers of subjects 
with  at  least  one  TEAE  obviously  vary  pronouncedly  between  different  studies  in  local  and  regional 
analgesia settings. No firm conclusions can be made. No clear trend of recorded TEAEs between different 
studies in same setting (according to surgery type) and between different settings (local and regional 
analgesia settings) were observed. Safety profile could be variable depending on the on the surgery type 
and different analgesia setting. Incidences of some TEAEs are remarkably different in compared studies, 
but  no  firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn  and  no  precautionary  measures  can  be  given.  This  observation 
increases level of uncertainty to overall safety profile of the new drug formulation. 
Most commonly reported TEAEs in combined pool: nausea (33.3%), constipation (16.2%), vomiting 
(13.4%), pyrexia (11.7%) and pruritus (7.5%). 
Number of common AEs were reported with higher frequencies for liposome bupivacaine compared to 
placebo:  nausea,  constipation,  anaemia,  oedema  peripheral,  tachycardia,  muscle  spasms,  anaemia 
postoperative, back pain, hypoesthesia, chills, oropharyngeal pain, pain in extremity, dysuria. 
Number of common AEs were reported with higher frequencies for liposome bupivacaine compared to 
bupivacaine HCl: vomiting, hypoesthesia oral, dysgeusia, dizziness, motor dysfunction, muscle twitching, 
confusional  state,  hyperhidrosis,  pruritus  generalised,  dyspepsia,  muscle  contractions  involuntary, 
haemoglobin decreased, post procedural oedema, hepatic enzyme increased, dry mouth.  
Furthermore, number of common AEs were reported with higher frequencies for liposome bupivacaine 
compared both to bupivacaine HCl and placebo: pyrexia, anxiety, somnolence, bradycardia, erythema, 
hyponatraemia, lethargy and blood glucose increased.  
Although  bupivacaine  is  an  active  substance  with  established  safety  profile,  applicant  was  asked  to 
elaborate how the formulation and higher doses correspond with safety profile in responses to the D120 
LoQ.  Significant  number  of  reported  AEs  have  higher  frequencies  in  comparison  to  bupivacaine  HCl 
and/or placebo. Higher incidence of somnolence was attributable to Study 208 (TKA); higher incidence 
of  bradycardia  was  attributable to  Study  326;  higher  incidence  of  pyrexia  was  attributable to  Studies 
208, 311, 322, 323, and 326, but the in-study rates were comparable to comparators; higher incidence 
of  dizziness  was  contributed  to  the  amalgamation  paradox  when  the  studies  were  pooled;  higher 
incidence  of  muscle  spasm  was  attributable  to  Study  331,  and  is  chance  finding  according  to  the 
applicant; hepatic enzyme elevations occurred in Study 326; in studies where pruritus generalised was 
reported,  the  incidence  rates  with  Exparel  and  the  respective  comparator  group  were  similar.  As 
expected, combined safety analysis pool gives somewhat distorted incidences of some adverse events, 
but additional analyses confirmed that. 
It  seems  that  Exparel  in  the  regional  analgesia  setting  has  somewhat  inferior  safety  profile  in 
comparison to the local analgesia setting. 
No  apparent  emergent  severe  TEAE  with  notably  higher  incidence  in  liposome  bupivacaine  groups  is 
noticed.  Number  of  severe  TEAEs  were  reported  only  in  all  doses  of  liposome  bupivacaine  group 
(combined safety pool). They were reported with low frequencies, but they are mostly reported for higher 
doses (≥ 266 mg) of liposome bupivacaine. 
Dysgeusia and hypoaesthesia oral were most common ADRs based on their relationship to study drug 
administration and the incidence of ≥5%. When analysing related TEAEs by SOCs in the combined pool, 
it is visible that higher percentages of AEs were assessed as related in all doses liposome bupivacaine 
group in comparison to bupivacaine HCl and/or placebo pertaining to particular SOCs (cardiac disorders, 
gastrointestinal  disorders,  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  injury,  poisoning  and 
procedural  complications,  investigations,  nervous  system  disorders).  Those  findings  suggest  worse 
safety  profile  of  liposome  bupivacaine  in  comparison  to  bupivacaine  HCl  and  placebo.  Particularly 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 132/147 
 
  
 
 
worrisome are cardiac and nervous system disorders as they pronouncedly differ from bupivacaine HCl 
and/or placebo. Furthermore, higher percentage of related TEAEs was reported for all doses of liposome 
bupivacaine in regional analgesia pool in comparison to bupivacaine HCl and placebo, suggesting worse 
safety profile of liposome bupivacaine in regional analgesia setting. Among different doses of liposome 
bupivacaine, 133 mg dose had the highest percentage of related TEAEs (around 50%) while for other 
doses between 8 and 13% of related TEAEs were reported. The applicant was asked to provide discussion 
on noted discrepancy of related TEAEs percentages among different doses of liposome bupivacaine. The 
most significant difference was observed for motor disfunction TEAE (133 mg group 20.7% vs 13.1% All 
dose  group,  0  IR  bupivacaine  group  and  10.4%  placebo  group).  The  applicant  was  initially  asked  to 
discuss underlying reasons for substantially higher incidence of motor disfunction TEAE reported in 133 
mg dose group for RA pool. When data are stratified by the studies where the motor dysfunction were 
mainly reported, there are no discrepancies among different Exparel doses and the numbers are similar 
to placebo group. 
The  applicant  identified  specific  issues  related  to  regional  analgesia.  As  almost  all  reported  falls  are 
attributable to regional analgesia setting in TKA, this setting bears additional safety concern. Warning 
on use as a femoral nerve block if early mobilisation and ambulation is part of the patient’s recovery 
plan has been proposed and it is supported. 
Studies of ECG effects for healthy volunteers did not indicate clinically relevant QT effects using supra-
therapeutic  doses  of  Exparel.  Clinically  significant  ECG  deviations  were  observed  in  both  bupivacaine 
groups (3.5% in All dose Exparel group and 3.9% IR bupivacaine dose) and were not reported in placebo 
group for the combined safety pool. No relationship with EPAREL dose was observed. These findings did 
not reveal any new safety issues and are in line with already established safety profile for bupivacaine. 
It must be noted that similar results for post-treatment EEG interpreted as significant abnormal were 
reported for Exparel and IR bupivacaine groups in the Combined safety pool (3.5% vs 3.9%). In the RA 
pool the percentage of subjects with a post-treatment ECG interpreted as clinically significant abnormal 
was lower in Exparel group compared to IR bupivacaine group (0.5% vs 5.3%).  While in the LA pool 
percentage  of  ECG  interpreted  as  clinically  significant  abnormal  was  notably  higher  in  Exparel  group 
compared  to  IR  bupivacaine  group  (7.8%  vs  3.4%).  The  applicant  was  asked  to  explain  reasons  for 
substantially higher percentage of post-treatment significant abnormal ECG in LA group. The applicant 
explained that the higher percentage of post-treatment ECGs read as clinically significant abnormal in 
the Exparel group relative to the IR bupivacaine group in the Local Analgesia (LA) pool was due to the 
imbalance of abnormal readings at baseline. Prior to study drug administration (i.e. baseline), the rate 
of clinically significant abnormal ECG readings was 5.2% (22/425) in the Exparel group and 0.9% (2/212) 
in the IR bupivacaine group. The imbalance in baseline ECG readings persisted during follow-up but was 
not meaningfully affected by study drug.  
Overall, most of the post-treatment ECGs interpreted as clinically significant abnormal in the Exparel and 
IR bupivacaine groups were also read as clinically significant abnormal at baseline prior to study drug 
administration.  The  imbalance  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  clinically  significant  abnormal  ECG 
readings was also present at baseline, prior to study drug administration. The percent of subjects with 
post-treatment  ECGs  who  had  a  new  clinically  significant  abnormal  ECG  finding  was  similar  in  the  All 
Exparel and IR bupivacaine groups in the LA pool (2.3% vs 1.7%). 
Based  on  known  safety  profile  of  bupivacaine  and  reported  TEAEs,  the  adverse  events  of  special 
interest  would  be  those  associated  with  cardiotoxicity,  neurotoxicity  and  possibly  LAST-related  ones 
(although no cases of LAST were identified by the applicant). The applicant initially failed to identify AEs 
of special interest in the summary of clinical safety, somewhat diminishing safety issues of the drug.  
Analyses  by  the  SOCs  did  not  reveal  major  safety  issue.  However,  cardiac  and  neurological  disorders 
were  common,  especially  neurological  disorders  that  were  observed  in  one  quarter  of  Exparel 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 133/147 
 
  
 
 
participants. Analysis of AEs, which could be consistent with LAST, was presented in the response to the 
D120  LoQ.  Presented  data  by  SOCs  of  interest  suggest  that  there  was  no  major  difference  between 
treatment groups. Nevertheless, as the AEs of special interest (i.e. cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, LAST) 
for Exparel, that could be life threatening, are found to be common with ones for bupivacaine HCl and 
other local anaesthetics, the applicant proposes PI communication as risk minimisation measures for the 
AEs of special interest. 
Fatal  cases  occurred  in  2  studies:  study  208  (TKA,  Phase  2,  Local  analgesia  pool)  and  study  322 
(posterolateral thoracotomy, Phase 3, Regional analgesia pool). 3 were reported in liposome bupivacaine 
group,  1  in  bupivacaine  HCl  group  and  4  in  placebo  group.  Study  investigators  considered  all  8  fatal 
cases not related to the study drug. In all three fatal cases in liposome bupivacaine groups, higher doses 
were administered (532 mg and 266 mg respectively). Reported fatal cases could indicate that liposome 
bupivacaine  administration  is  not  suitable  for  regional  analgesia  in  high  invasive  surgical  procedures, 
and that higher dose could be associated with higher risk of cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity, and that 
dose reduction may be required in elderly and debilitated patients.  
There  is  a  trend  towards  an  increased  rate  of  TESAEs  in  Exparel  group.  Incidences  of  observed 
individual SAEs are low and additional analyses did not reveal new information. Nevertheless, there is a 
clear dose related trend for liposomal bupivacaine SAEs and it seems that there were more SAEs in 
high invasive surgical procedures (such as TKA and posterolateral thoracotomy).  
Regarding laboratory findings, in depth assessment was provided in responses to the D120 LoQ, with 
revision of AEs listed in proposed PI. Following laboratory findings are included in proposed PI: hepatic 
enzyme  increased,  white  blood  cell  count  increased,  alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  aspartate 
aminotransferase increased, blood creatinine increased. 
There were considerably higher incidences of TEAEs and TESAEs in elderly subjects recorded. Although 
the TEAEs and SAEs incidences were higher for ≥65 years of age group, the applicant is of opinion that 
the greater sensitivity to bupivacaine cannot be ruled out, and that the higher prevalence of comorbidities 
and concomitant medications should be taken into account. It can be concurred that there is an increased 
risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality among elderly patients and that observed AE incidences 
are probably not only attributable to the concerned medicinal product. Moreover, similar AE incidences 
and  similar  differences  between  younger  and  older  populations  were  observed  in  bupivacaine  IR  and 
placebo groups too. 
Some specific AEs tend to increase by age (e.g. fall). As mentioned by the applicant, ‘greater sensitivity 
of some older patients cannot be ruled out’. Given that motor disfunction potentially leading to fall is one 
of characteristic AEs reported for Exparel, additional warning about increased risk to falls in elderly people 
have been included in the PI. 
Comparison of race as intrinsic factor does not reveal remarkable differences taking into account that 
presented summary data in the submitted dossier are not easy to evaluate. 
When  evaluating  the  combined  pool  analysis,  majority  of  subjects  (1171/1645,  71.2%  All  Exparel, 
497/625, 79.5% IR bupivacaine, 435/604, 72.0% placebo) had a baseline ASA class of 1-2. Although 
higher incidences of TEAE/TESAEs are expected in subjects with higher ASA class 3-4, there were a 
notably  high  number  of  individual  AEs  reported,  except  falls  indicated  by  the  applicant.  Additional 
analysis confirmed that there were no meaningful differences when analysing Exparel doses and SOCs. 
No major differences among treatment groups were observed regarding incidences of TEAEs and TESAEs 
when analysed according to ASA status. 
The  applicant  did  not  initially  provide  any  discussion  regarding  specific  medical  environment  (i.e. 
anaesthesia,  concomitant  rescue  medications),  neither  possible  clinically  important  considerations.  In 
the  following  stages  of  the  procedure  the  applicant  provided  satisfactory  response  regarding  drug 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020

interactions. The applicant has divided drug interactions in those related to bupivacaine in the systemic 
circulation and those interactions that impact the release characteristics of bupivacaine from Exparel. 
For drug interactions related to bupivacaine in the systemic circulation, information for bupivacaine HCl 
is adopted. This approach is acceptable. For drug interactions that impact the release characteristics of 
bupivacaine  from  Exparel  in  vitro,  nonclinical  and  clinical  physicochemical  interaction  studies  were 
performed  (please  refer  to  PK  assessment  too).  Admixing  with  either  lidocaine,  ropivacaine  or 
mepivacaine  has  been  shown  to  cause  an  immediate  release  of  bupivacaine  from  DepoFoam.  The 
applicant has  conducted in  vitro  and nonclinical  studies  to  evaluate interactions  of  Exparel  with  other 
commonly  used  products  in  the  surgical  setting  (such  as  epinephrine,  steroids,  anti-infective  drugs, 
opioids,  and  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs)  and  has  found  that  those  products  have  minimal 
impact on the release of bupivacaine from Exparel. Minor discussion on neuromuscular blocking agents 
that  can  be  expected  to  be  administered  concomitantly  has  been  provided,  stating  that  no  impact  of 
neuromuscular  blocking  agents  with  Exparel  has  been  noted  during  the  clinical  trials.  Although  local 
anaesthetics  can  enhance  the  neuromuscular-blocking  effect  of  neuromuscular  blocking  agents,  this 
information  is  deemed  as  a  common  healthcare  professionals’  (dealing  with  local  anaesthetics  and 
neuromuscular  blocking  agents)  knowledge  and  it  is  not  necessary  to  be  included  in  the  PI.  Co-
administration with other local anaesthetics and their additive toxic effect. Information on use with other 
local anaesthetics or active substances structurally related to amide-type local anaesthetics, e.g. certain 
anti-arrhythmics, such as lidocaine and mexiletine, because of additive systemic toxic effects has been 
added in the SmPC by the assessor.  
Use in obstetrical paracervical block anaesthesia is contraindicated and there is recommendation against 
use during pregnancy. It is anticipated that clinicians are aware of increased issues of LAST in pregnant 
women,  especially  those  at  term,  and  no  further  warning  is  deemed  necessary.  Bupivacaine  and  its 
metabolite, pipecoloxylidide, are present in human milk at low levels. Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in breastfed infants a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue/abstain from Exparel therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Information  on  severe  renal  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  have  been  substantiated  in  the 
responses to the D120 LoQ.  
Overall,  number  of  recorded  TEAEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation  is  low.  It  is  visible  from  the 
presented  data  that  266  mg  and  higher  doses  of  liposome  bupivacaine  were  associated  with  higher 
numbers  of  subjects  with at  least one  TEAE  leading  to  discontinuation  of  the study.  It  seems  that  all 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were recorded in regional analgesia pool. 
Initially,  the  applicant  failed  to  discuss  and  explore  the  non-clinical  findings  regarding  local 
tolerability  and  to  link  them  to  clinical  settings.  They  are  particularly  worrisome  as  they  include 
subcutaneous  mineralisation  and  irreversible  granulomatous  inflammation  due  to  Depo  Foam 
component. Moreover, presence of exogenous lipids seems to be a nidus for the development of foreign 
body type of reaction in surrounding tissues which is not reversible even after a period of one month. 
This  was  shown  after  a  single  application,  but  especially  with  repeat/prolonged  exposure.  It  seems 
possible that prolonged or repeated application of Exparel could cause dystrophic changes at the injection 
site. The applicant addressed those issues in response to the D120 LoQ. It is recognised that Exparel 
material (exogenous lipids) can remain at the injection site for several weeks, and the normal clearance 
mechanisms for such material can result in local foreign body reactions, and the timeframe required for 
clearance can appear to cause a delay in recovery time dependent on the relative amount delivered and 
the site of administration. However, the clinical data show that non-clinical findings are not transferred 
to  the  clinical  setting.  Wound  healing  issue  does  not  seem  to  be  significant.  Post-marketing  data 
further strengthen this conclusion. It is expected to be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020

The  applicant  has  addressed  the  post-marketing  experience  according  to  the  ICH  M4E(R2)  in 
responses to the D120 LoQ. Post-marketing data are presented for the period from 28 Oct 2011 to 27 
Oct 2019. All the data are from the US. Estimated number of exposed subjects is high (357,452 patients 
treated for nerve block and 5,595,912 patients treated for infiltration). In the concerned period, there 
were  961  cases of  ADRs  reported,  of  those  approximately  35%  were  serious ADR  cases  (339  serious 
cases) and 622 non-serious cases. During the same period, there were 1837 adverse events reported, 
including 611 serious and 1226 non-serious adverse events. 16 serious labelled drug-drug interaction 
medication  errors  were  reported.  The  applicant  has  not  identified  any  new  safety  issues  from  case 
reports. The applicant has identified 153 cases that are considered potential-LAST case reports and 19 
fatal potential-LAST case reports in the above-mentioned post-marketing period. There is no particular 
signal and that routine pharmacovigilance measures should be employed. 
Generally, the PI data have been adequately substantiated.  
Of note, the applicant initially failed to address potential important safety issues as suggested through 
SAs given by various NCAs. MPA (2006) pointed out following potential issues:  
•  Safety of the product if unintentionally not handled correctly;  
• 
Possibility  of  a  very  short  time  release  of  free  bupivacaine  in  different  clinical  scenarios  (e.g. 
sepsis, fever, acidosis); 
•  Safety of large doses of liposomal bupivacaine unintentionally injected intravenously; 
•  Safety of large doses of liposomal bupivacaine unintentionally injected intraarterially (e.g. in the 
neck region during interscalene block). 
Sufficient data on above mentioned issues have been provided in response to the D120 LoQ and adequate 
information are proposed in the PI. The use of Exparel in different clinical scenarios (e.g. sepsis, fever, 
acidosis) still remains an uncertainty as the applicant has provided only quality data on this matter.  
Intravascular and intra-articular routes of administration have been contraindicated. 
Medical  errors  issue  regarding  undistinguishable  appearance  of  Exparel  and  propofol,  and  one 
regarding additional use of local anaesthetics (only important potential risk outlined) are discussed in 
proposed RMP. 
2.6.6.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the available safety data supported the Application for Exparel. Though 
bupivacaine  HCl  has  well  known  safety  profile,  this  application  concerns  a  drug  that  delivers  active 
substance  from  liposomes,  containing  high  dose  of  bupivacaine  free  base.  This  has  been  adequately 
reflected in the Product Information and Risk Management Plan.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the new formulation, the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for 
Exparel liposomal is needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for bupivacaine. The 
requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request the alignment of the new PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is28.10.2011. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
Based on a detailed justification submitted by the applicant the QRD group decided to allow the use of 
minimum labelling particulars for the label of the 20 mL vial, mirroring the same minimum particulars 
as the ones included on the label of the 10 mL vial presentation. The Group also suggested to include 
the total content per total volume on the vials’ labels. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as ‘‘an unpleasant sensory 
and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of 
such damage”. According to the Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products intended for 
the treatment of pain (EMA/CHMP/970057/2011) pain can be described as acute or chronic according to 
its duration. Acute pain is considered adaptive, in that it has a warning function. It is of short duration 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 138/147 
 
  
 
 
 
(generally  up  to  a  few  weeks)  and  declines  with the  healing  of  the  underlying  injury  or  disease  (e.g. 
post-surgical pain). Pain after surgery is a predictable part of the postoperative experience. However, 
like all pain, postoperative pain is complex and multidimensional. According to the applicant, three in 
four  patients  who  experience  acute  postoperative  pain  report  it  as  moderate,  severe,  or  extreme  in 
intensity. The current consensus clinical practice guidelines in Europe and the US recommend utilising 
multimodal analgesic regimens to manage acute postsurgical pain (Chou 2016; Meissner 2015; European 
Society of Regional Anaesthesia & Pain Therapy 2019). Multimodal analgesic regimens combine two or 
more agents or techniques that act by different analgesic mechanisms to provide enhanced pain relief.  
Local anaesthetics are particularly useful for management of moderate-to-severe acute pain and have 
been shown to improve postsurgical analgesia. But their duration of effect is shorter than the duration 
of moderate-to-severe postsurgical pain. For example, IR bupivacaine has a labelled maximum duration 
of  effect  of  eight  hours  for  both  field  block  and  major  nerve  block  (Marcain  SmPC).  According  to  the 
applicant  Exparel  was  developed  as  a  longer-acting  analgesic  that  provides  sustained  relief  from 
moderate-to-severe acute pain following surgery or traumatic injury. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Multimodal analgesic regimens combine two or more agents or techniques that act by different analgesic 
mechanisms to provide enhanced pain relief while minimising the adverse side effects of any one agent. 
The  current  treatment  options  for  postsurgical  analgesia  include  local  anaesthetics,  opioids, 
gabapentinoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and acetaminophen. The selection of 
components of any pain management strategy are tailored to the patient, the surgical procedure, and 
the expected type, location, and duration of pain. 
Local anaesthetics are particularly useful for management of moderate-to-severe acute pain and have 
been shown to improve postsurgical analgesia and reduce opioid utilisation. Local anaesthetics may be 
used  as  a  field  block  to  create  local  analgesia  around  an  injury,  surgical  site,  or  tissue  plane  or  as  a 
peripheral  nerve  block  to  create  regional  analgesia  around  a  larger  area.  While  conventional  local 
anaesthetics  are  commonly  used  because  of  their  long-standing  benefit-risk  profile,  their  duration  of 
effect  is  typically  shorter  than  the  duration  of  moderate-to-severe  postsurgical  pain,  which  can  often 
extend for several days. For example, IR bupivacaine has a labelled maximum duration of effect of eight 
hours for both field block and major nerve block.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant provides efficacy results from the 6 Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, dose 
finding/ranging studies and 12 Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, multicentre studies which are grouped 
by the intended effect of Exparel to produce local analgesia or regional analgesia: 
• 
Local  analgesia  (field  block)  studies:  201  and  207  (hernia  repair);  209,  312,  and  316 
(haemorrhoidectomy);  208,  311,  and  331  (TKA);  317  (bunionectomy);  210  (breast 
augmentation); 329 (third molar extraction); and 411 (Caesarean section). 
•  Regional analgesia (peripheral nerve block) studies: 203 (bunionectomy); 323 and 326 (TKA); 
327 (TSA/RCR); and 322 (thoracotomy). 
For local analgesia 
There were five Phase 2 studies and seven Phase 3 studies. The Phase 2 studies evaluated Exparel doses 
ranging from 66 mg to 532 mg and were used to inform dosing for the Phase 3 studies. The Phase 3 
studies assessed the efficacy and safety of Exparel doses ranging from 106 mg to 532 mg. 
For regional analgesia 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 139/147 
 
  
 
 
Exparel was administered as a peripheral nerve block. There were two Phase 2 studies and four Phase 3 
studies. The Phase 2 studies evaluated Exparel doses ranging from 67 mg to 310 mg and were used to 
inform the dosing for the Phase 3 studies. The Phase 3 studies assessed the efficacy and safety of Exparel 
133- and 266-mg doses.  
The surgical procedures selected for the clinical studies are representative of surgeries that would be 
expected  to  lead  to  moderate-to-severe  pain  of  sufficient  duration  to  benefit  from  a  long  acting  local 
anaesthetic  and  where  sustained  management  of  acute  pain  is  traditionally  managed  with  a  CPNB  or 
opioids.  The  surgical  procedures  included  models  of  both  somatic  pain  (e.g.,  third  molar  extraction, 
bunionectomy,  major  orthopaedic  surgery)  as  well  as  models  of  mixed  somatic/visceral  pain  (e.g., 
abdominal/thoracic surgery). 
Different doses were evaluated and compared with saline placebo and IR bupivacaine (as standard of 
care). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  Exparel 266 mg was superior to placebo in the management of postoperative pain for 72 hours 
in  haemorrhoidectomy  (AUC0-72  of  the  NRS-R  pain  intensity  scores  using  wWOCF  for  rescue 
medications and LOCF for missing data in an appropriate efficacy population); Study 316. 
•  Statistically  significant  reduction  in  secondary  outcomes  regarding  opioids  (total  opioid  use 
through 72 hours, opioid-free through 72 hours and time to first opioid) were observed in Study 
316. 
•  Exparel 106 mg was superior to placebo in the management of postoperative pain for 24 hours 
in  bunionectomy  (AUC0-24  of  the  NRS-R  using  wWOCF  for  rescue  medications  and  LOCF  for 
missing data in an appropriate efficacy population); Study 317. 
•  Statistically significant reduction in secondary outcomes regarding opioids (number of Percocet 
tablets through 24 hours, rescue-free through 24 hours and time to first Percocet) were observed 
in Study 317. 
•  Sensitivity  analysis  in  study  317  (wWOCF+mWOCF;  wWOCF  on  Completers  and  LOCF)  were 
supportive of the primary analysis. 
•  Exparel 266 mg + bupivacaine 89 mg was superior to bupivacaine 89 mg in the management of 
postoperative pain during 12-48 hours postoperatively in total knee arthroplasty (AUC12-48 of the 
VAS pain intensity scores using wWOCF for rescue  medications and MI for missing data in an 
appropriate efficacy population); Study 331. 
•  Statistically  significant  reduction  in  secondary  outcomes  regarding  opioids  (total  opioid  use 
through 48 hours, opioid-free through 48 hours and time to first opioid) were observed in Study 
331. 
•  Statistically significant reduction in one of several secondary outcomes regarding opioids (total 
opioid through 72 hours) was observed in Study 411. 
•  Exparel 266 was superior to placebo in the management of postoperative pain for 72 hours in 
total knee arthroplasty (AUC0-72 of the NRS-R using wWOCF for rescue medications and LOCF for 
missing data in an appropriate efficacy population); Study 323. 
•  Statistically significant reduction in one of several secondary outcomes regarding opioids (total 
opioid through 72 hours) was observed in Study 323. 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 140/147 
 
  
 
 
•  Exparel 133 mg was superior to placebo in the management of postoperative pain for 48 hours 
in  Total  Shoulder  Arthroplasty  or  Rotator  Cuff  Repair  (AUC0-48 of  the  VAS  pain  intensity  score 
using wWOCF+MI in an appropriate efficacy population); Study 327. 
•  Statistically  significant  reduction  in  secondary  outcomes  regarding  opioids  (total  opioid  use 
through 48 hours, opioid-free through 48 hours and time to first opioid) were observed in Study 
327. 
•  Recue medications were mainly comparable across phase 3 studies, although some differences 
exist. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  Superiority of Exparel over primary or secondary outcomes was not established for 3 studies in 
local analgesia setting (311, 312 and 329) and 2 studies in regional analgesia setting (322 and 
326). 
• 
The definition of the primary efficacy population in Study 411 is not in line with the ITT principle. 
When  all  randomised  and  treated  patients  were  analysed,  the  difference  in  total  opioid  use 
through 72 hours (primary endpoint) in Exparel vs comparator groups was no longer statistically 
significant.  Results  for  the  primary  outcome  for  the  re-analyses  show  a  LS  mean  treatment 
difference of-2.9 MME with a wide 95% CI that crosses zero (95% CI -15.4 to 9.6) and a p-value 
of 0.33. No significance was observed in any of the other outcomes when the results were re-
analysed,  except  for  the  secondary  outcome  of  pain  intensity  scores  that  met  the  criteria  for 
non-inferiority (consistent with the primary analysis). 
•  Exparel 266 mg + bupivacaine 44 mg was non-inferior to bupivacaine 44 mg during 72 hours in 
Caesarean section (AUC0-72 of the VAS pain intensity score using wWOCF+MI in an inadequately 
defined efficacy population); Study 411. 
•  A statistically significant difference regarding the percentage in opioid-free subjects through 72 
hours and time to fist opioid was not observed between groups (Exparel 266 mg + bupivacaine 
44 mg vs bupivacaine 44 mg) in Study 411. 
•  A statistically significant difference regarding the percentage in opioid-free subjects through 72 
hours and time to fist opioid was not observed between groups (Exparel 266 mg vs placebo) in 
Study 323. 
•  Based on Phase 2 studies no clear dose-effect pattern was obvious. 
•  Harder to treat patients were excluded from every study. 
•  About  33%  of  patients  were  from  Europe,  the  rest  were  from  the  US.  According  to  provided 
literature data, European patients have statistically significant lower pain scores in the first day 
after orthopaedic surgery and use less opioids.  
•  Active comparators in studies 331 and 411 are sub-dosed.  
•  Baseline pain medications were not standardised across main phase 3 studies – each study had 
a  different protocol  regarding  baseline pain  management.  Some  didn’t  allow  for  baseline  pain 
medications. 
• 
Imputation procedures for rescue pain medication and missing data varied across studies. The 
amount of missing data in Study 331 was substantial. In the primary evaluation period (from 
12 to 48 hours), the proportion of missing pain intensity scores was between 11.6% and 52.9% 
in  Exparel+IR  bupivacaine  group  and  between  8.7%  to  42%  in  IR  bupivacaine  group.    An 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 141/147 
 
  
 
 
imbalance in the amount of missing data between treatment arms is noted and the nature of 
missing data is unknown (wasn’t recorded).  
• 
• 
In  study  316  lack  of  a  statistically  significant  difference  concerning  PONV-free  time,  use  of 
antiemetics and postoperative constipation was observed despite a significant reduction in the 
use of opioids in Exparel arm. 
In study 316, when wWOCF for rescue pain medication is not applied, the difference in primary 
outcome did not reach statistical significance. 
•  Clinical significance of the results is inconsistent across primary and key secondary outcomes in 
the studies that reached statistical significance.  
•  Only 2 phase 3 studies showed a statistically significant difference in the percentage of opioid-
free subjects at 72 hours in favour of Exparel. 
• 
In the majority of main Phase 3 studies all or nearly all patients required opioid rescue through 
72 hours.  
•  Out of initially opioid-free patients, more of them allocated to Exparel required an opioid at later 
timepoints  compared  to  those  allocated  to  the  comparator.  This  was  observed  in  Study  411, 
where  additional  11  patients  (15.3%)  who  were  opioid-free  through  72  hours  in  Exparel+IR 
bupivacaine group required an opioid from 72 hours to 14 days, while in IR bupivacaine group 
additional 5 patients (7.1%) required opioids. The same pattern is observed in Study 317, where 
additional  5  patients  (5.1%)  who  were  rescue-free  at  24  hours  in  Exparel  group  required  an 
opioid  from  24-72  hours,  while  in  placebo  group  no  additional  patients  required  rescue 
medications from 24-72 hours. The same pattern is observed in Study 327, where additional 12 
patients  (17.4%)  who  were  opioid-free  through  24  hours  in  Exparel  group  required  an  opioid 
from  24-72  hours,  while  in  placebo  group  no  additional  patients  required  opioids  from  24-72 
hours.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Percentages of subjects with at least one TEAE was high among the all doses liposome bupivacaine but 
did not differ substantially from bupivacaine HCl and placebo groups (around 72%). Higher percentages 
of AEs were assessed as related in all doses liposome bupivacaine group in comparison to bupivacaine 
HCl and/or placebo pertaining to particular SOCs (cardiac disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general 
disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications, 
investigations,  nervous  system  disorders).  Cardiac  and  nervous  system  disorders  pronouncedly  differ 
from bupivacaine HCl and/or placebo (cardiac disorders - 0.8 vs 0.2 vs 0; nervous system disorders - 
8.7 vs 1.3 vs 8.6). Higher incidences of liposome bupivacaine SAEs belonging to particular SOCs (cardiac 
disorders,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications, nervous system disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders) when comparing to bupivacaine HCl and/or placebo.  
266 mg and higher doses of Exparel were associated with higher numbers of subjects with at least one 
TESAE and severe TEAE, higher numbers of subjects with at least one TEAE leading to discontinuation 
of the study and death. Clear dose related trend for liposomal bupivacaine SAEs and ones exclusively 
reported for liposome bupivacaine was observed. 
Most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  in  combined  pool:  nausea  (33.3%),  constipation  (16.2%),  vomiting 
(13.4%), pyrexia (11.7%) and pruritus (7.5%). 
EMA/CHMP/528272/2020  
Page 142/147 
 
  
 
 
Common  AEs  were  reported  with  higher  frequencies  for  liposome  bupivacaine  compared  to  placebo: 
nausea, constipation, anaemia, oedema peripheral, tachycardia, muscle spasms, anaemia postoperative, 
back pain, hypoesthesia, chills, oropharyngeal pain, pain in extremity, dysuria. 
Common AEs were reported with higher frequencies for liposome bupivacaine compared to bupivacaine 
HCl: vomiting, hypoesthesia oral, dysgeusia, dizziness, motor dysfunction, muscle twitching, confusional 
state,  hyperhidrosis,  pruritus  generalised,  dyspepsia,  muscle  contractions  involuntary,  haemoglobin 
decreased, post procedural oedema, hepatic enzyme increased, dry mouth.  
Common  AEs  were  reported  with  higher  frequencies  for  liposome  bupivacaine  compared  both  to 
bupivacaine  HCl  and  placebo:  pyrexia,  anxiety,  somnolence,  bradycardia,  erythema,  hyponatraemia, 
lethargy and blood glucose increased. 
Safety  data  presented  represent  more  serious  safety  profile  in  regional  analgesia  setting.  In  regional 
analgesia pool AEs were reported with higher frequencies for liposome bupivacaine compared both to 
bupivacaine  HCl  and  placebo  (belonging  to  cardiac  disorders,  nervous  system  disorders,  infectious, 
injuries,  post  procedural  complications,  hepatic  disorders).  All  TEAEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation 
were  recorded  in  regional  analgesia  pool.  The  applicant  identified  specific  issues  related  to  regional 
analgesia. Almost all reported falls are attributable to regional analgesia setting in TKA.  
Fatal  cases  occurred  in  2  studies:  study  208  (TKA,  Phase  2,  Local  analgesia  pool)  and  study  322 
(posterolateral thoracotomy, Phase 3, Regional analgesia pool). 3 were reported in Exparel group, 1 in 
IR bupivacaine group and 4 in placebo group. Study investigators considered all 8 fatal cases not related 
to the study drug. In all three fatal cases in Exparel groups, higher doses were administered (532 mg 
and  266  mg  respectively).  Cases  from  study  322  were  reported  in  elderly  male  patients  and,  among 
other reported fatal AEs, common one was codded as cardiac arrest. 
The recommendation to avoid using another bupivacaine (according to US label expanded to all local 
anaesthetic)  96  hours  after  using  Exparel  limits  analgesic  options  in  case  of  failure  of  Exparel  and 
circumstances where revision or reoperation is needed. 
There was significant difference in incidences of TEAEs and SAEs in elderly population, aged ≥65 years 
in comparison to <65 years of age population. Proposed PI was amended to properly reflect differences 
in safety profile in elderly when compared to patients <65 years. Although the incidences were higher 
for ≥65 years of age group, the greater sensitivity to bupivacaine cannot be ruled out, and the higher 
prevalence  of  comorbidities  and  concomitant  medications  should  be  taken  into  account.  Observed  AE 
incidences are probably not only attributable to the concerned medicinal product. Moreover, similar AE 
incidences and similar differences between younger and older populations were observed in bupivacaine 
IR and placebo groups too. There were higher incidences of TEAEs and TESAEs in subjects in the ASA 
class 3-4 groups as compared with those in the ASA class 1-2 groups in Exparel groups. There were no 
meaningful differences when analysing Exparel doses and SOCs. 
Medical errors issue regarding undistinguishable appearance of Exparel and propofol. Important potential 
risk identified in the proposed RMP: medication errors due to additional use of local anaesthetics. 
Submitted  post-marketing  data  include  most  commonly  reported  ADRs:  “Injury,  Poisoning,  and 
Procedural Complications (e.g., drug-drug interaction, procedural pain), Nervous System Disorders (e.g., 
palsy, seizure), General Disorders And Administration Site Conditions (e.g., lack of efficacy, pain), Skin 
And  Subcutaneous  Tissue Disorders  (e.g.,  erythema,  rash),  and  Cardiac  Disorders  (e.g.,  bradycardia, 
cardiac arrest).” 35% of all post-marketing cases were serious. The applicant has identified 153 cases 
that are considered potential-LAST case reports and 19 fatal potential-LAST case reports in the above-
mentioned post-marketing period.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Number of important issues initially were not addressed by the applicant or were not detailed enough, 
and they raise important uncertainties and limitations about knowledge of safety profile: 
Potential drug-drug interactions with medicinal products excluded during clinical development. 
Profound applicability to the EU population. 
According to quality data there seems not to be a specific safety issue due to possibility of a very short 
time release of free bupivacaine in different clinical scenarios (e.g. sepsis, fever, acidosis), although real 
clinical settings might bring additional risks. Those specific clinical scenarios remain uncertainty. 
Toxicity  and  overdose  potential  exist  since  large  doses  of  liposome  bupivacaine  and  other  local 
anaesthetics can be administered by both surgeon and anaesthesiologist during same surgical procedure.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Exparel has shown superiority over placebo in the management of postoperative pain in several surgery 
models (bunionectomy, haemorrhoidectomy, total knee arthroplasty and total shoulder arthroplasty or 
rotator cuff repair).  
Exparel showed an 18% increase in the proportion of opioid-free subjects 72 hours in Study 316. These 
patients were able to remain completely free of opioids, which is the ultimate goal. Another benefit is 
reduction in total postoperative opioid use, which was observed in Study 316 through 72 hours (46% 
relative reduction), in Study 323 through 72 hours (26.3% relative reduction) and Study 327 through 
48 hours (77.2% relative reduction). The expected time to onset of analgesia with Exparel is 2 minutes. 
The  duration  of  analgesic  efficacy  as  shown  in  pivotal  phase  3  trials  was  24  hours  in  local  analgesia 
studies and between 24 hours and 72 hours in regional analgesia studies.  
The safety profile is acceptable and adequately reflected in Product Information and Risk Management 
Plan.  
3.8.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits observed in the pivotal clinical trials are considered to outweigh the risks. 
3.9.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Exparel indicated as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of 
post-operative  pain  in  adults,  and  as  a  field  block  for  treatment  of  somatic  post-operative  pain  from 
small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Exparel is favourable in the following indication: 
Exparel liposomal is indicated as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-
operative pain in adults, and as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- 
to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults (see section 5.1)

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1.1 
Introduction  
Gardasil is a quadrivalent (HPV Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) recombinant HPV vaccine (qHPV) that was  
licensed  on  24  September  2006  for  the  prevention  of  high-grade  cervical  and  vulvar  dysplasia, 
cervical  cancer  and  external  genital  warts  causally  related  to  the  vaccine  HPV  types.  The  dose 
schedule  includes  3  intramuscular  0.5  ml  doses  administered  at  0,  2,  6  months.  The  approval  was 
based on two pivotal phase III trials after a mean follow-up of two years. The approved indication in 
2006 is as follows: 
“Gardasil  is  a  vaccine  for  the  prevention  of  high-grade  cervical  dysplasia  (CIN  2/3),  cervical 
carcinoma,  high-grade  vulvar  dysplastic  lesions  (VIN  2/3),  and  external  genital  warts  (condyloma 
acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18. 
The indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Gardasil in adult females 16 to 26 years of 
age  and  on  the  demonstration  of  immunogenicity  of  Gardasil  in  9-  to  15-year  old  children  and 
adolescents. Protective efficacy has not been evaluated in males (see section 5.1). 
The use of Gardasil should be in accordance with official recommendations.” 
The present type II variation application concerns an extension of the indication to include protection 
against: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
vulvar and vaginal cancer; 
low-grade vulvar (VIN 1) dysplasia; 
high-grade and low-grade vaginal (VaIN 1/2/3) dysplasia; 
low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 1); 
based on updated efficacy and safety data (3-year data) from the pivotal phase III studies (FUTURE I 
and  II)  as  well  as  post-marketing  experience.  Compared  with  the  database  that  supported  the 
marketing authorisation application (MAA), this application includes ~ 1 more year of follow-up in 
the phase III program. 
The present application has the following objectives: 
•  Update  vaccine  efficacy  (VE)  with  respect  HPV6/11/16/18-related  cervical,  vulvar  and 
vaginal dysplasia 
•  Update VE with respect HPV16/18-related VaIN 2/3 
•  Update the rationale for inclusion of CIN 1 in the therapeutic indication 
•  Update VE with respect HPV16/18-related cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancer (via surrogate 
markers) 
•  Update the duration of VE with respect to HPV6/11/16/18-related cervical, vulvar and vaginal  
pre-cancerous lesions 
•  Evaluate HPV type replacement

1.2 
Clinical aspects 
HPV  infection  is the most common sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Approximately 50% of 
sexually active adults become infected with HPV during their lifetime. HPV infection can cause pre-
cancerous dysplastic lesions and cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, and external genital skin, as 
well  as  benign  genital  and  respiratory  tumors  (condyloma  acuminata  and  Recurrent  Respiratory 
Papillomatosis  (RRP),  respectively).  An  overview  is  given  below  concerning  the  new  proposed 
indications by the MAH.  
Cervical Cancer 
Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide resulting in 
approximate  493,000  new  cases  and  274,000  deaths  each  year.  HPVs  are  judged  to  be  the  primary 
cause of cancer, detected in over 99% of cervical cancers. In the year 2004 the International Agency 
for Research on Cancer estimated that cervical cancer was diagnosed in approximately 34 300 women 
in the 27 member states of the European Union and about 16 300 women died from the disease. It is 
estimated  that  within  the  European  population  each  year  there  are  ~33,000  women  diagnosed  with 
cervical  cancer  and  15,000  deaths  from  this  disease.  Organised  cervical  cancer  screening  programs 
have reduced cancer rates by ~75% in the developed world. The success of Pap testing has shifted the 
burden associated with HPV disease from managing the morbidity and mortality of cervical cancer to 
managing a large number of premalignant and other HPV-associated lesions (Cervical Intraepithelial 
Neoplasia (CIN) grades 1, 2, 3).  
Low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 1) 
CIN  1  is  the  most  frequent  HPV-related  dysplastic  lesion  of  the  cervix.  The  potential  for  CIN  1  to 
progress  to  CIN  2/3  or  cervical  cancer  is  low,  but  the  health  and  economic  consequences  of  these 
lesions are substantial. The lifetime risk of acquiring CIN 1 (17 %) is four times that of CIN 2/3 or 
AIS (4%) in places where cervical cancer screening programs are established. In all of Europe, it is 
estimated  that  817,000  women  are  newly  diagnosed  with  low  grade  cervical  lesions  (CIN  1)  each 
year. Most CIN 1 lesions regress to normal, but it is not possible to differentiate those lesions that will 
persist  and  progress  to  CIN  2/3  from  those  that  will  regress.  All  women  with  CIN  1  require  close 
follow-up, including repeated diagnostic biopsies. 
Other HPV related cancers 
Other  HPV-related  cancers  include  vulvar  and  vaginal  cancers  that  occur  predominantly  in  young 
women  and  result  in  ~1600  deaths  in  the  US  each  year.  They  are  preceded  by  dysplastic  lesions 
(vulvar  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (VIN)  and  vaginal  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (VaIN).  In  men,  anal 
cancer  is  the  most  common  HPV-related  cancer  with  5000  cases  reported  annually  in  the US. Also 
penile  and  certain  oral  cancers  are  caused  by  the  virus.  Other  benign  HPV-associated  conditions 
include  condyloma  acuminata  (genital  warts)  located  in  the  genital  or  perianal  region  and  juvenile 
RRP  primarily  located  in  the  larynx.  RRP  is  thought  to  occur  by  transmission  of  the  virus  from  an 
infected mother to her child. 
Vulvar cancer and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) 
Vulvar  cancer  accounts  for  3  to  5%  of  all  gynecologic  cancer  cases.  Data  on  the  exact  burden  of 
vulvar cancer in Europe are not presently available, but in the US in 2005, it has been estimated that 
approximately 3870 women would be diagnosed with vulvar cancer and 870 women would die from 
the disease. Up to 90% of vulvar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Vulvar cancer can be HPV-
Related  (typically  occurs  in women under the age of 65) and non-HPV-Related (typically occurs in 
women >65 years).  
HPV-related vulvar cancer accounts for 15 to 50% of cases of vulvar cancer. 
Vaginal cancer and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) 
Vaginal  cancer  accounts  for  1  to  2%  of  all  gynecologic  cancer  cases.  In  the  US  in  2005,  ~2140 
women  were  estimated  to  be  diagnosed  with  vaginal  cancer  and  800  women  would  die  from  the 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease. Data on the exact burden of vaginal cancer in Europe is not presently available. In 2005, in 
the UK there were 223 new diagnoses of vulvar cancer and 100 deaths from this disease.  
1.2.1  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program for Gardasil was designed to measure the impact of the vaccine on 
the  cervical  cancer  risk  using  a  composite  endpoint  of  CIN  2/3,  adenocarcinoma  in  situ  (AIS)  and 
cervical  cancer.  The  primary  goal  was  to  evaluate  vaccine  impact  on  the  incidence  of  HPV  16/18-
related  CIN  2/3,  AIS  or  cervical  cancer.  A  secondary  goal  was  to  evaluate  vaccine  impact  on  the 
overall incidence of CIN 2/3, AIS or cervical cancer. 
Main studies 
The  clinical  efficacy  program  for  Gardasil  included  4  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled 
phase II and phase III clinical studies (for details about studies see table 1). Phase II studies included 
protocol  005  (evaluated  the  HPV  16  component  of  Gardasil)  and  protocol  007.  Phase  III  studies, 
included  FUTURE  I  (Protocol  013)  and  FUTURE  II  (Protocol  015).  Altogether  these  4  studies 
randomised 20,887 16- to 26-year-old adolescent and young adult women, of whom 20,845 subjects 
received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  vaccine  (Gardasil,  HPV  16  L1  VLP  vaccine  component  of 
Gardasil,  or  placebo).  Protocol  005  was  complete  at  the  time  of  the  marketing  authorisation.  
Protocols  007-10,  013,  and  015  were  ongoing  in  the  efficacy  follow-up  phase  at  the  time  of  the 
marketing authorisation.

Study populations  
Per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population:  
•  Received all 3 doses of study vaccine 
•  Were seronegative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) at Day 1 
•  Were PCR negative to relevant vaccine HPV type at Day 1 and at Month 7 
•  Did not deviate from the protocol  
•  Cases counted starting 30 days post-dose 3 (Month 7) 
The Per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population was used as the primary analysis population for efficacy 
and includes subjects naïve to relevant vaccine HPV types. 
MITT-populations (modified intention to treat populations): 
•  MITT-2 population 
•  Restricted MITT-2 (R-MITT2)   
•  MITT-3 population: general population (ITT) 
Two MITT populations were used for the analysis of efficacy with respect to the population benefit 
endpoints (i.e., evaluation of the impact of Gardasil on the incidence of disease caused by vaccine or 
non-vaccine  HPV  types).  Importantly,  these  populations  differ  from  those  in  the  marketing 
authorisation application with respect to the extent of HPV type testing. This updated report, include 
additional testing for 10 common non-vaccine HPV types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 and 
59) in all swabs and tissue specimens obtained during the phase III studies.  
MITT-2 population 
•  Received at least one dose of study vaccine  
•  Were seronegative and PCR-negative to all 4 vaccine HPV types at Day 1 
•  Were PCR-negative at Day 1 to the appropriate non-vaccine HPV type (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 
52, 56, 58, or 59) or had a negative Day 1 Pap test result 
•  Had at least one follow-up visit after 1 month following the first injection 
•  Cases were counted starting after Day 30 
This  population  represents  virginal  HPV  naïve  young  women  but  who  could  be  infected  with  HPV 
before or after the completion of the vaccination period. 
Restricted MITT-2 (R-MITT2)   
•  Received at least one dose of study vaccine  
•  Were seronegative and PCR negative to all 4 vaccine HPV types at Day 1  
•  Were  PCR  negative  to  HPV  31,  33,  35,  39,  45,  51,  52,  56,  58,  and  59  at  Day  1  and  had  a 
negative Pap test result at Day 1 
•  Had at least one follow-up visit after 1 month following the first injection 
•  Cases were counted starting after Day 30 
The RMITT-2 was designed to approximate a population of adolescent and young adult women who 
were either sexually-naïve or sexually-experienced and had not yet been exposed to any HPV type but 
who could be infected with HPV before or after the completion of the vaccination period.  
MITT-3 population: general population (ITT) 
•  Received at least one dose of study vaccine  
•  Regardless of PCR status at Day 1 
•  Cases counted starting 30 days after Day 1 
Compared with the main analysis populations, the MITT-3 population also includes subjects who 
were already infected with a vaccine or non-vaccine HPV type at Day 1 and subjects who had 
evidence of CIN at Day 1 (e.g., an abnormal Pap test at Day 1). Such a population approximates the 
general population of sexually-active 16- to 26-year-old girls and provides a real world estimate of 
efficacy in the vaccinated population.

Efficacy  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  (any  grade)  was  100%  in  the  PPE  population. 
Altogether,  there  were  17  CIN  3  cases  and  6  AIS  cases  in  the  placebo  group  versus  none  in  the 
vaccine group resulting in efficacy of 100% for both these high-grade lesion types and with the lower 
bound  of  the  95%  CIs  above  0%.  Efficacy  was  comparable  across  HPV  types.  The  results  in  the 
MITT-2  population  supported  the  PPE  analysis.  The  case  of  HPV  18-related  CIN  1  in  the  vaccine 
group of the MITT-2 population was described in the MAA.

The efficacy estimates in the MITT-3 population were substantially lower, which could be expected 
since this population included cases already infected at baseline. The variations in percent reductions 
for  disease  by  HPV  6,  11,  16  or  HPV  18  were  correlated  with  the  baseline  prevalence  of  infection 
with  individual  HPV  type.  The  lowest  effect  was  observed  for  HPV  16,  which  was  most  prevalent 
among the vaccine HPV types. Vaccine efficacy against HPV 6/11//16/18-related CIN 2/3, AIS was 
increased compared to the MAA, 35% (95% CI: 7, 55) vs. 23% (95% CI: <0, 48). However, by lesion 
type, statistical significance with respect to efficacy against CIN 2 or CIN 3 lesions was not reached 
(lower 95% CIs were <0%). 
(cid:190)  Secondary efficacy analysis 
The  efficacy  of  the  vaccine  against  the  combined  incidence  of  HPV  16-  or  HPV  18-related  CIN  or 
AIS is shown in Table 3.

In  the  secondary  analysis  of  efficacy  against  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  lesions,  high  efficacy  (100%) 
against  CIN  of  all  grades  was  demonstrated  in  the  PPE  population.  However,  in  the  MITT-3 
population,  the  vaccine  estimates  were  substantially  lower;  VE  against CIN 2/3 was 33% (95% CI: 
3.3, 53.7).  By lesion, for CIN 2, CIN 3 and AIS only numerical reductions were seen.  
The  vaccine  estimates  were  comparable  between  the  current  and  MAA  report  and  there  was  no 
evidence of waning immunity.

reported were condyloma acuminata of vulvar origin. HPV 6 was the predominant HPV type. Since 
HPV 6 and 11 cause the majority of genital warts (>95%) high vaccine efficacy was also observed in 
the  MITT-3  population.  There  were  few  VIN  and  VaIN  lesions  in  all  populations,  although  all 
endpoint cases occurred in the placebo group in the PPE population. In the MITT-3 population, VE 
was not significant for the combined endpoint of VIN 2/3 or VaIN 2/3.

There were few cases of HPV 16/18-related high-grade vulvar and vaginal neoplasia and the majority 
were caused by HPV 16. Only in the combined analysis of HPV 16/18-related VIN/VaIN 2/3, vaccine 
estimates were statistically significant in the PPE and MITT 2 populations. No statistically significant 
efficacy was seen in the MITT-3 population. 
As for cervical lesions, the current results with respect to HPV6/11/16/18-related EGL, were similar 
to those in the MAAand there was no evidence of waning immunity. 
•  Updated Exploratory efficacy analyses - evaluation of population impact 
Exploratory analyses to estimate the impact of vaccination on the overall burden of cervical, vaginal 
or  vulvar  disease  (caused  by  vaccine  or  non-vaccine  HPV  types)  were  conducted.  These  analyses 
were  performed  in  the  redefined  MITT-2  and  RMITT-2  population,  as  well  as  in  the  MITT-3 
population.

 Analyses in the RMITT-2 represent the best available population to examine overall vaccine impact 
on  the  rate  of  CIN  (any  grade)  or  AIS  due  to  incident  infection  (i.e.  infection  following  onset  of 
vaccination). In the general population (MITT-3), the effect of Gardasil against CIN of any grade due 
to any HPV type was 20%, which was largely due to reductions in low-grade lesions CIN 1. For CIN 
2/3  or  AIS,  no  significant  vaccine  efficacy  was  demonstrated  (VE:  7.8%)  and  was  even negative (-
9.2%) against CIN 3. 
(cid:190)  EGL due to any HPV type 
The reductions with respect to the incidence of EGLs were greater than those observed for cervical 
lesions. In the RMITT-2 and MITT-3 populations Gardasil reduced the rate of any vulvar or vaginal 
lesion regardless of HPV type by 49.5% and 34.4%, respectively. With respect to VIN and VaIN, both 
low and high-grade lesions, only numerical reductions were seen (lower 95% CIs <0%) in all study 
populations. 
The comparison of current results with the MAA is only possible for the MITT-3 population since the 
definition  of  the  RMITT-2  and  MITT-2  populations  have  changed  with  the  additional  testing  of  10 
non-vaccine HPV types. The comparison MITT-3 shows that the rates of detection of CIN and EGL 
lesions  over  the  additional  follow-up  period  (5.1/100  person-years  at  risk  (PYR)  and  1.7/100  PYR) 
were lower than those observed in the MAA (6.1 and 2.3, respectively). In general, the magnitude of 
benefit was somewhat higher in the updated results.

Results  of  the  primary  efficacy  analyses  are  shown  in  Table  7.  No  cases  of  cervical  cancer  were 
reported in study 015. The observed vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 in the PPE 
population was 97.6%. 
The  results  in  the  MITT-2  analysis  were  supportive  of  the  results  in  the  PPE-population.    In  the 
MITT-3 population vaccine efficacy was substantially lower, 44%. The majority of MITT-3 endpoint 
cases  occurred  in  subjects  who  were  seropositive  or  PCR  positive  at  Day  1.  Due  to  the  higher 
prevalence of HPV 16 at baseline, VE against HPV 16-related CIN 2/3 was lower than that against 
HPV 18-related CIN 2/3.

Vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 remained high in the PPE-population, with one 
single case of CIN 3 in the vaccine group. This lesion was possibly related to a non-vaccine HPV type 
since  HPV  16  was  only  detected  once,  whereas  HPV  52  was  detected  on  several  occasions.  In  the 
MITT-3  population  VE  against  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  2/3  was  44%,  which  is  higher  than  that 
observed  in  the  MAA  (VE:  39%).  It  is  of  note  that  VE  estimates  against  CIN  3, which is the most 
relevant marker, were significant in all study populations ranging from 97% to 45% in the PPE- and 
MITT-3  population,  respectively,  For  AIS  there  were  too  few  endpoint  cases  to  allow  any 
conclusions.

(cid:190)  Secondary efficacy analysis 
In  the  PPE  population,  administration  of  Gardasil  reduced  the  combined  incidence  of  HPV 
6/11/16/18-related CIN (any grade) or AIS by 93 % and that of HPV 16/18-related CIN by 91% (See 
Table 8).

Vaccine efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related low-grade CIN remained at the same high level as 
that  observed  in  the  MAA.  Against  CIN  1,  VE  ranged  from  92%  to  65%  in  the  different  study 
populations. 
External genital lesions 
The  efficacy  of  Gardasil  against  EGLs  remained  high  across  all  efficacy  populations  (Table  9). 
Efficacy also remained high for the combined incidence of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related VIN 2/3 or 
VaIN 2/3. No cases of vulvar or vaginal cancer were observed in the study.

* Two cases of HPV 6-related condyloma acuminata were detected in subjects who received Gardasil within the 
PPE population. These cases are described as follows: 
1.  AN  57819:  This case was reported in the P015 CSR submitted as part of the MAA. This case of HPV 6-
related genital warts occurred in an 18-year-old Caucasian woman. She was negative at Day 1 by PCR to all 
14  HPV  types  for  which  testing  was  conducted.  At  Month  8,  she  was  found  to  have  an  HPV  6-related 
condyloma. She had mounted a strong anti-HPV 6 response at Month 7.

2.  AN 40727: This case of HPV 6-related genital warts occurred in a 16-year-old Caucasian woman. She was 
negative at Day 1 by PCR to all 14 HPV types for which testing was conducted. At Month 36, she was found 
to have genital warts. A biopsy obtained at that time confirmed this diagnosis. The lesion was positive for 
HPV 6 and HPV 59 DNA. The subject did not participate in the Consistency Lot substudy and, thus, did not 
undergo serology testing after Day 1.

Efficacy  results  in  this  large  study  were  similar  to  those  obtained  in  study  013,  i.e.  with  a 
predominance of condyloma among disease categories and HPV 6 among vaccine types. Vulvar and 
vaginal lesions were rarely detected and all the HPV 16/18-related high-grade lesions were caused by 
HPV 16. A consistent pattern was that all VIN/VaIN cases regardless of grade in the PPE- and MITT-
2  analyses  were  reported  in  the  placebo  group.  Significant  efficacy against HPV 16/18-related VIN 
2/3 or VaIN 2/3 was seen in all study populations.  
The current results were similar to those in the MAA and there was no evidence of waning immunity 
over the 3 year follow up period. 
•  Updated Exploratory efficacy analyses - evaluation of population impact 
(cid:190)  CIN due to any HPV type 
In the RMITT-2 population Gardasil reduced the combined rates of CIN (any grade) or AIS by 28.6%, 
of CIN 2/3 by 49.4% and CIN 3 by 55.3% (Table 11). In the MITT-2 population observed efficacy 
was lower (19.5%) although significant for all disease severities. 
In the MITT-3 population CIN was reduced by 14%, CIN 2/3 by 16.8% with the lower 95% CI barely 
above 0% (0.1%). For CIN 3 only a numerical reduction of 20.9% (95% CI <0 to 37.8%) was noted.  
Compared  with  the  RMITT-2  population,  a  total  of  378  and  415  cases  of  the  composite  endpoint 
CIN/AIS  were  added  to  the  vaccine  and  placebo  groups,  respectively  in  the  MITT-3  population. 
Among  these,  349  (92%)  and  375  (90%)  of  cases  in  the  respective  group,  occurred  among  women 
who were PCR-positive to one of the 14 tested HPV types at Day 1.

The overall benefit of Gardasil with respect to CIN was low in the MITT-3 analysis, although higher 
than in the MAA. 
(cid:190)  EGL due to any HPV type 
In the RMITT-2, MITT-2 and MITT-3 populations Gardasil reduced the rates EGLs by 88.3%, 75.9% 
and 57.9% respectively. The higher efficacy noted for EGL compared to CIN/AIS can be explained by 
the inclusion criteria and by the fact that a large proportion of EGLs are due to vaccine HPV types.

1.2.1.3   
Combined analysis of study protocols  
As in the MAA the two pre-planned pooled analyses were performed and updated with the additional 
follow-up data at 3 years: 
1) integrated summary of efficacy: includes P007, P013 and P015.  
2) combined phase II/III efficacy analysis: includes P005 (16-related endpoints only), P007, P013 and 
P015. 
The efficacy for HPV 16/18 related CIN 2/3 or AIS is based on data from protocols 005, 007, 013, 
and 015. The efficacy for all other endpoints is based on protocols 007, 013, and 015. 
1.2.1.3.1 
Combined protocols 007, 013 and 015 
Update of the integrated summary of efficacy  
Protocol  007,  013  and  015  were  included  in  the  updated  integrated  summary  of  vaccine  efficacy 
against  CIN,  EGL,  Pap  abnormality  endpoints  and  cervical  procedures  in  this  report.  Altogether 
18,174 women aged 16 to 26 years were randomised across the 3 study protocols. 
(cid:190)  Efficacy with respect to HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (any grade), AIS or cervical cancer 
There was no case of cervical cancer in any of the studies. The estimates of efficacy within each of 
the  3  protocols  were  consistent  with  the  overall  estimates  of  VE  across  the  protocols.  The  vaccine 
efficacy in the MITT-2 population (VE: 94.5%) was similar to efficacy in the PPE population (VE: 
96%),  whereas  lower  estimates  were  noted  in  the  MITT-3  population  (VE:  53.9%).  In  the  PPE 
population, there was 1 new case of HPV 18-related CIN 1 and a single case of HPV 16-related CIN 3 
in the group that received Gardasil reported since the MAA.  
Efficacy was observed for each vaccine HPV type of the composite HPV 6-, HPV 11-, HPV 16- or 
HPV  18-related  CIN  (any  grade)  or  AIS  endpoint  and  was  similar  to  that  reported  in  the  MAA. 
Efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN 2/3 was 98.7%, 97.2% and 42.1% in the PPE-, MITT-2 
and  MITT-3  population,  respectively.  Corresponding  efficacy  for  CIN  1  was  95.5%,  94.6%  and 
64.5%.  
In  the  placebo  group  within  the  MITT-2  population,  the  cumulative  incidence  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-
related  CIN  (any  grade)  or  AIS  through  approximately  3 years  of  follow-up  was  2.7%.  The  risk  of 
developing an endpoint was reduced from 1 in 40 in the placebo group to 1 in 719 in the group that 
received Gardasil. 
In the MITT-3 population, administration of Gardasil resulted in a 54% reduction in the incidence of 
HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (any grade) or AIS, compared with placebo. In the MAA, a 46% (95% 
CI:  35  to  56%) reduction was observed. The hazard of becoming a case of HPV 6/11/16/18-related 
CIN in the placebo group increased over time compared to the group vaccinated with Gardasil. Hence, 
the  percent  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  in  the  vaccinated  group 
compared with placebo increased over time.  
The  vaccine  efficacy  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  (any  grade)  was  maintained  through  an 
additional  year  of  follow-up  with  comparable  efficacy  in  the  PPE-  and  MITT-2  populations.  It  is 
reassuring  that  VE  against  CIN  2/3,  and  in  particular  against  CIN  3,  which  is  the  most  relevant 
surrogate marker for cervical cancer, was significant in all study populations including the MITT-3. 
The  single  case  of  HPV  16-related  CIN  3  that occurred in the vaccine group (PPE population) was 
most likely caused by HPV 52. Also for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) VE was demonstrated in the 
PPE-  and  MITT-2  analyses,  although  there  were  few  cases.  All  AIS  cases  were  detected  in  the 
placebo group. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  efficacy  results  are  comparable  to  those  obtained  in  the  MAA.  The  difference  between  the 
vaccine  and  placebo  group  in  the  incidence  of  CIN  lesions,  increased  during  the  additional  year  of 
follow-up. Almost all of the new cases in the  Gardasil group (MITT-3 population) were in subjects 
who  had  evidence  of  prior  HPV  exposure,  whereas  those  in  the  placebo  group  were  true  new 
infections. 
(cid:190)  Efficacy with respect to HPV 6/11/16/18 18-related EGL 
Efficacy results against HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL in the combined analysis are presented in Table 
12.  There  were  no  cases  of  vaginal/vulvar  cancer  observed  in  any  of  the  studies.  The  efficacy  of 
Gardasil  was  99%  in  the  PPE  population  (2  vs.  189  cases).  The  MITT-2  analysis  supported  the 
primary analysis in the PPE population. 
In  the  MITT-3  population,  administration  of  Gardasil  resulted  in  a  77.6%  (95%  CI:  71.0,  82.9%) 
reduction  in  the  incidence  of  HPV 6/11/16/18-related  EGL  compared  with  placebo.  The  hazard  of 
becoming a case of HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL in the placebo group increased over time compared 
to  the  group  vaccinated  with  Gardasil.  Hence,  the  percent  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  HPV 
6/11/16/18-related EGL in the vaccinated group compared with placebo increased over time. 
The integrated analysis of vaccine efficacy against EGL by HPV vaccine type showed that estimates 
were similar across the different HPV type-related EGLs and significant for each type in all 3 study 
populations. There were 2 cases of HPV 6-related vulvar condyloma in the vaccine group of the PPE-
population. The single case of VIN 2/3 in the MITT-2 population was HPV 16-related. In the MITT-
population the estimates of efficacy were consistent across the different disease severities.

Condyloma: In the PPE population, efficacy was 98.7% for HPV 6- or 11-related condyloma.  When 
comparing  the  PPE  population  and  MITT-2  population,  an  additional  7  subjects  in  the  group  that 
received  Gardasil and 53 subjects in the placebo group were found to have an HPV 6- or HPV 11-
related  condyloma  in  the  MITT-2  population.  Thus,  there  is  evidence  that  the  vaccine  is  already 
efficacious  during  the  course  of  the  vaccination  regimen.  The  impact  of  Gardasil  in  the  MITT-3 
population was lower than the efficacy observed in the PPE population and MITT-2 population due to 
the presence of disease that was caused by infections that were already present at Day 1. 
The updated integrated efficacy results are consistent with those obtained in the MAA.

(cid:190)  Vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18-related EGL 
In  the  integrated  efficacy  analysis  significant  vaccine  efficacy  against  both  HPV  16/18-related  VIN 
2/3  and  VaIN  2/3  was  demonstrated  in  all  study  populations,  supporting  the  claim  of  the  MAH  to 
include VaIN 2/3 in the indication. VE for VaIN 2/3 was 100% in the PPE population and 81.8% in 
the MITT-3 population. In the separate studies, no VE could be shown due to the sparseness of cases 
with high-grade vulvar and vaginal lesions. However, the pattern was consistent across protocols with 
almost all endpoint cases in the placebo group. The majority of VIN/VaIN 2/3 lesions were caused by 
HPV 16 (64% in the placebo group). This finding and the higher incidence of VIN 2/3 compared with 
VaIN 2/3 are consistent with published data. 
With  regard  to  low-grade  lesions,  vaccine  efficacy  was  demonstrated  against  VaIN  1  in  all  study 
populations, whereas for VIN 1 no significant efficacy was shown. The knowledge about these low-
grade lesions is limited and the terminology for vaginal/vulvar lesions is not as established as that for 
cervical  lesions.  The  ISSVD  society  has  recommended  the  abolition  of  VIN  1  due  to  low 
reproducibility. The proportion of these low-grade lesions caused by oncogenic HPV types need to be 
clarified. At this stage the MAH´s claim for VIN 1 and VaIN 1 in the indication cannot be considered 
justified. 
•  Overall impact on invasive cervical procedures 
In the RMITT-2 population, the combined incidence of cervical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures 
was reduced in the group that received Gardasil compared with the placebo group with respect to the 
incidence  rates  of  colposcopy,  cervical  biopsy,  and  cervical  definitive  therapy  (Table  13).  Results 
observed in the MITT-3 population were lower but consistent with those in the RMITT-2 population.

The reductions observed with regard to definitive therapy (40% (RMITT-2) and 20% (MITT-3)) seen 
are considered clinically relevant. 
•  Therapeutic efficacy 
An analysis was conducted to determine whether, among subjects who showed evidence of infection 
with a vaccine HPV type at Day 1, administration of Gardasil reduced the proportion of subjects who 
were found to have progressed to clinical disease due to that type, compared with placebo.  
The  combined  data  do  not  provide  adequate  evidence  that  Gardasil  has  therapeutic  efficacy  against 
HPV  type-related  CIN  or  EGL  endpoints  for  the  non-HPV-naïve  populations.  The  analyses  did  not

The  results  obtained  in  this  combined  efficacy  analyses  were  comparable  to  those  observed  in  the 
MAA, but now based on a larger number of CIN 2/3 cases (86 vs. 53, PPE population) increasing the 
precision of the vaccine estimates. The single case in the vaccine group was an HPV 16-related CIN 3 
case in Month 25. The subject was positive to HPV 52 at baseline and in 5 histology specimens (both 
biopsy  and  LEEP).  HPV  16  was  detected  in  one  histology  sample.  The  efficacy  estimates  against 
HPV 16/18-related CIN 3 and AIS, the most relevant surrogate markers for cervical cancer, were both 
significant, with VE of 98% and 100%, respectively in the PPE-population and 97% and 100% in the 
MITT-2.  There  were  only  7  cases  AIS  in  the  PPE-  and  10  cases  in  the  MITT-2  population,  but  all 
occurred in the placebo group.  
The efficacy estimate in the MITT-3 population was increased to 44% compared to 39% in the MAA. 
With  respect  to  CIN  3,  VE  was  39%  (21,  53),  which  did  not  fulfil  the  statistical  criterion  of  the 
analysis (lower bound of 95% CI >25%). 
1.2.1.3.3 
Protocols P013, P015 combined 
(cid:190)  Combined  efficacy  results  with  respect  to  CIN  2/3  or  AIS  caused  by  vaccine  and  non-vaccine 
HPV types  
The  efficacy  results  with  respect  to  CIN  2/3  or  AIS  due  to  any  HPV  type  by  severity    are 
presented  in  the  table  15  below.  In  the  MITT-2  population  a  combined  efficacy  of  27.1%  was 
obtained. In the most restricted population RMITT-2, corresponding to a sexually naïve population, 
VE  was  46.1%  against  CIN  2/3,  AIS  and  54.5%  against  CIN  3  which  is  clinically  relevant.  This 
estimate  is,  however,  lower  than  the  expected  (70%),  but  might  be  explained  by  baseline  high-risk 
HPV infections that were not detected by Pap test or the current HPV testing methods.  
The overall benefit of Gardasil against any CIN 2/3 or AIS regardless of causal HPV type was limited 
in the general population (MITT-3). The observed efficacy was only 13.5% (18% (95% CI: 6 to 28) if 
P005  and  P007  was  included  in  the  analysis).  When  analysed  by  disease  severity,  no  significant 
efficacy against CIN 3 was documented (lower 95% CI <0%)

Over  time  the  benefit  of  the  vaccine  was  shown  to  increase  relative  to  placebo.  However,  the 
incidence  of  CIN  2/3  also  increased  substantially  in  the  vaccinated  population,  suggesting  an 
important role of non-vaccine HPV types.  
(cid:190) Combined efficacy results with respect to CIN 1 due to any HPV type  
Vaccine efficacy against CIN 1 due to any HPV type was 27.9% (95% CI: 12.0, 41.0) in the RMITT-2 
population, 22.3% (95% CI: 11.2, 32.0) in the MITT-2 population and 19.0% (95% CI: 10.0, 27.0) in 
the MITT-3 population of the combined studies 013 and 015. 
(cid:190) Efficacy against VIN 2/3 and VaIN 2/3 due to any HPV type

Vaccine  efficacy  against  VIN/  2/3  due  to  any  HPV  type  was  demonstrated  in  all  study  populations 
and  was  high  in  the  HPV  naïve  women,  87%  in  RMITT-2  population  and  72%  in  the  MITT-2 
population  supporting  the  important  role  of  vaccine  HPV  types  in  this  condition.    In  the  MITT-3 
population it was lower, 49.9%. For VaIN 2/3 only numerical reductions were observed in all study 
populations.

(cid:190) Efficacy with respect to external genital lesions due to any HPV type 
The higher efficacy in the RMITT-2 population (VE: 74.1%) compared with the MITT-2 population 
(VE:  65.2%)  is  likely  a  reflection  of  the  fact  that  only  subjects  who  were  negative  to  all  14  tested 
HPV types and who had a normal Pap test result at Day 1 were included in the RMITT-2 population, 
whereas the MITT-2 population included any subject who was negative to at least 1 tested HPV type 
(Table 17). The more stringent RMITT-2 inclusion criteria identify a population of women who are 
less likely to have been exposed to any vaccine or non-vaccine HPV type compared with the MITT-2 
population. The reductions observed in the MITT-3 populations were more modest (VE: 49.0%).

Vulvar cancer 
*The  case  of  vulvar  cancer  was  described  in  the  MAA.  A  22-year-old  woman  reported  a  small  lesion  on  her 
perineum 18 months after completion of a 3-dose regimen of Gardasil. The perineal swabs for HPV testing were 
positive  for  HPV 16 and HPV 59. The biopsy revealed a well differentiated squamous carcinoma. PCR of the 
biopsy was negative including 10 non-vaccine HPV types. The lesion was not visible during follow-up and no 
treatment was provided.

1.2.1.4   
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In  this  type  II  variation  application  for  Gardasil  the  MAH  seeks  approval  for  an  extension  of  the 
indication  to  include  protection against vulvar and vaginal cancer, low-grade vulvar dysplasia (VIN 
1), high-grade and low-grade vaginal (VaIN 1/2/3) dysplasia and low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 1) 
based on one more year of follow-up of vaccine efficacy in the phase III program (FUTURE I and II) 
as well as post-marketing experience. The follow-up period after the first vaccine dose is at present 
approximately 3 years. The expansion of the database with longer term data on vaccine efficacy, made 
possible a definitive analysis of the impact of the vaccine on the overall HPV disease burden. 
In  the  primary  assessment  of  this  variation  the  CHMP  identified  major  objections  and  a  number  of 
other concerns. The MAH´s claims for vaginal and vulvar cancers and for low-grade cervical, vaginal 
and vulvar dysplasia (CIN 1, VIN 1, VaIN 1) in the indication were not considered approvable. 
The updated results in the HPV-naïve populations (PPE and MITT-2) confirmed and strengthened the 
efficacy findings in the MAA. Vaccine efficacy against the primary endpoint, HPV 16/18-related CIN 
2/3  or  AIS,  remained  high  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  waning  immunity.  The  pooled  efficacy 
analysis  in  the  PPE-population  was  based  on  a  total  of  86  cases  of  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  2/3 
(compared to 53 cases in the MAA), whereof one case was detected in the vaccine group and 85 cases 
in the placebo group (VE: 99% (95% CI: 93.3, 100.0). The one case of CIN 2/3 in the vaccine group 
was likely causally related to a non-vaccine HPV type (HPV 52). With respect to the most relevant 
surrogate  markers  for  cervical  cancer,  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  3  and  adenocarcinoma  in situ (AIS), 
efficacy estimates were significant for both endpoints (VE: 98% and 100%, respectively) in the HPV 
naïve populations. In the MITT-3 population, that included subjects, who were already infected with a 
vaccine/non-vaccine  HPV  type  at  baseline,  vaccine  efficacy  against  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  2/3  or 
AIS  was  44%  (compared  with  39%  in  the  MAA).  With  respect  to  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  1, 
efficacy remained high in all study populations, with VE of 95.5% in the HPV naïve population and 
VE of 64.5% in the MITT-3 population. There was no evidence of therapeutic vaccine efficacy. 
Efficacy  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  genital  warts  (condyloma  acuminata)  remained  high,  with 
efficacy estimates of 99%, 95% and 77% in the PPE, MITT-2 and MITT-3 populations, respectively.  
In the integrated summary analysis, significant vaccine efficacy against both HPV 16/18-related VIN 
2/3  and  VaIN  2/3  was  demonstrated  in  all  study  populations,  supporting  the  claim  of  the  MAH  to 
include also VaIN 2/3 in the indication. VE for VaIN 2/3 was 100% in the PPE population and 81.8% 
in  the  MITT-3  population.  Hence,  the  supplementary  data allowed for a conclusion that Gardasil is 
efficacious against HPV 16/18-related VaIN 2/3, which support the inclusion of this condition in the 
indication.  
In the MAH´s response to the first RSI, the claims for the prevention of vulvar and vaginal cancer was 
withdrawn.  It  was  agreed  that  at  the  present  stage  neither  international  guidelines  nor  consensus 
statements  of  the  scientific  community  are available to support high-grade vulvar/vaginal lesions as 
valid surrogate markers for cancer. The MAH also withdrew his claims for low-grade vulvar (VIN 1) 
and vaginal (VaIN 1) intraepithelial lesions in the indication.  
The MAH´s claim for CIN 1 was retained and supported by a recent published European guideline for 
quality  assurance  in  cervical  screening.  In  the  MAH´s  view  the  need  for  clinical  follow  up,  further 
diagnostic procedures and potentially therapy, as recommended in the guideline, is best addressed by 
having CIN 1 in the SPC section 4.1. In the EU guideline CIN 1 is recognised as a lesion that requires 
follow-up with repeat cytology, HPV testing, colposcopy and excision in selected cases. The CHMP 
agrees  that  the  accuracy  in  the  diagnosis  of  CIN  1  in  clinical  practice  can  be  variable.  The 
management of low-grade cervical lesions has to be balanced against the high chance of spontaneous 
regression (60-70%) and negative histology with the possible risk of not treating underreported and/or 
missed high-grade disease. Although CIN 1 is not a surrogate marker for cancer, the need to follow-up 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these lesions translates to a substantial public health burden, since CIN 1 is the most common HPV-
related cervical lesion. The vaccine HPV types are estimated to cause 30-50% of CIN 1 lesions, which 
in  Europe  corresponds  to  approximately  286 000  CIN  1  lesions  annually.  In  the  combined  study 
protocols (007, 013, 015) vaccine efficacy against CIN 1 related to vaccine HPV types was 95.5% in 
the PPE population; 94.6% in the MITT-2 population and 64.5% in the MITT-3 population. Vaccine 
efficacy  against  CIN  1  due  to  any  HPV  type  was  27.9%  (95%  CI:  12.0,  41.0)  in  the  RMITT-2 
population, 22.3% (95% CI: 11.2, 32.0) in the MITT-2 population and 19.0% (95% CI: 10.0, 27.0) in 
the MITT-3 population of the combined studies 013 and 015. The reduction in the overall burden of 
CIN 1 disease of 30% in the HPV naïve population would result in significant public health benefit. 
The analysis of the public health impact revealed a significant reduction in the overall burden of CIN 
2/3 or AIS in the HPV-naïve population, whereas  the reduction in the general population (MITT-3) 
was  limited.  The  vaccine  efficacy  against  CIN  2/3  or  AIS  due  to  any  HPV  type  in  the  RMITT-2 
population was 46.1% (95% CI 23.6, 62.3). The observed efficacy in the MITT-3 population was only 
13.5% (18% (95% CI: 6 to 28) (if studies 005 and 007 were included in the analysis). When analysed 
by disease severity, no significant efficacy against CIN 3 was documented (lower 95% CI <0%) in the 
MITT-3  population.  With  regard  to  the  impact  on  invasive  cervical  procedures,  it  was  shown  that 
definitive  therapy  was  reduced  by  40%  and  colposcopy  by  20%  in  the  vaccinated  RMITT-2 
population  and  20%  and  11%,  respectively,  in  the  MITT-3  population.  More  long-term  data  are 
needed  to  evaluate  the  real  public  health  impact  of  Gardasil.  However,  these  results  are  clinically 
relevant from a public health perspective and justify a statement in the section 5.1 of the SPC. 
As regards the indication, SPC section 4.1, the MAH was requested to simplify the wording and use 
the more general term ´premalignant genital lesions´ instead of the list of study endpoints. Moreover, 
the SPC changes proposed by the MAH in section 5.1 required major revision.  
In  the  response  to  the  second  RSI,  the  MAH  accepted  the  requested  simplified  wording  of  the 
indication  provided  that  the  localisation  of  the  genital  lesions  was  defined  and  that  the  conditions 
covered in the indication were further specified in section 5.1. The proposed additions are considered 
reasonable  except  for  the  inclusion of CIN 1 in the introductory sentence in section 5.1, since low-
grade  cervical  intraepithelial  lesion  is  not  considered  a  premalignant  genital  lesion.  The  estimated 
vaccine efficacy against CIN 1 is described elsewhere in section 5.1.

1.2.2  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall, 21,480 subjects were vaccinated in protocols 007, 013, 015, 016 and 018. A total of 11,912 
subjects  received  at  least  one  dose  of  qHPV.  This  includes  a  total  of  120  subjects  in  protocol  007 
extension  who  received  a  3-dose  regimen  of  placebo  in  the  main  study  and  subsequently  received 
qHPV  in  the  extension  phase  of  the  study.  A  total  of  9688  subjects  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
placebo. 
Fourteen (14) subjects who were randomised to receive qHPV and 2 subjects randomised to receive 
placebo  received  protocol  non-compliant  vaccination  regimens  and  were  excluded  from  the  safety 
summary. 
Common Adverse Experiences 
Injection-Site Adverse Experiences 
As  noted  in  the  MAA  and  Safety  Update  Report  (SUR)  for  the  Detailed  Safety  Population,  the 
proportion  of  subjects  reporting  an  injection-site  adverse  experience  within  5  days  after  any 
vaccination  was  higher  in  subjects  who  received  qHPV  compared  with  subjects  who  received 
aluminum-containing placebo or non-aluminum-containing placebo. The most common injection-site 
adverse experiences reported were pain, swelling, and erythema. 
Systemic Clinical Adverse Experiences 
As  noted  in  the  MAA  and  SUR  for  the  Detailed  Safety  Population,  the  most  common  reported 
systemic  clinical  adverse  experiences  determined  by  the  investigator  to  be  vaccine  related  were 
headache, pyrexia, and nausea.  The proportions of subjects who reported a systemic clinical adverse 
experience, and the proportions of subjects who reported a vaccine-related systemic clinical adverse 
experience, were comparable between the two vaccination groups. 
Death 
Overall, a total of 18 subjects died at any time during the studies.  Of 11,464 subjects who received at 
least one dose of qHPV, 11 subjects (0.1%) died.  Of 9686 subjects who received placebo, 7 subjects 
(0.1%)  died.  None  of  the  deaths  was  considered  placebo  or  procedure  related.  Compared  with  the 
SUR  data  one  additional  subject  committed  suicide  1177  days  after  completion  of  the  primary 
vaccination series.  
No causal relationship between the fatal outcomes and administration of qHPV vaccine was identified. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy Outcomes in the Integrated Databases of Phase III Clinical Studies of qHPV 
Overall,  2832  subjects  experienced  3225  pregnancies  (1396  recipients  of  qHPV  (13.4%)  and  1436 
recipients  of  placebo  (15.7%).  The  lower  rate  in  the  qHPV  group  is  likely  due  to  the  higher 
proportions of 9- to 15-year-old subjects in this group as compared with the placebo group. 
Among the 3225 pregnancies, outcomes were known for 2652 fetuses/infants (1315 qHPV recipients 
and 1337 placebo recipients). Since the cut-off date for the original SUR (Safety Update Report) 709 
pregnancies  have  been  reported.  The  majority  of  pregnancies  with  unknown  outcomes  were 
pregnancies that were ongoing at the time of cut-off date. 
Live births: Cumulatively the proportions of pregnancies that resulted in a live birth were comparable 
between the vaccination groups. 
Methods  of  delivery:  Cumulatively  the  proportions  of  deliveries  that  were  vaginal  or  by  Caesarean 
section were comparable between the vaccinations groups. 
Live-  born  Infants:  The  great  majority  of  live-born  infants  in  both  vaccination  groups  were 
categorised as normal. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Congenital anomalies: 
The  proportion  of  live  births  that  resulted  in  congenital  anomalies  was  comparable  between  the 
vaccination  groups.  Congenital  anomalies  that  occurred  in  the  Phase  III  studies  are  cumulatively 
listed.  NEW  congenital  anomalies  were  reported  in  10  study  subjects  who  received  qHPV.  These 
anomalies included cardiac septal defect, congenital pulmonary valve atresia, heart disease congenital, 
persistent  fetal  circulation,  accessory  auricle,  choanal  atresia,  palpebral  ptosis,  thalassemia  alpha, 
polydactyly and renal aplasia. Congenital anomalies were reported in 6 children born to subjects who 
received  placebo.  These  anomalies  included  atrial  septal  defect,  tricuspid  valve  incompetence, 
ventricular septal defect and persistent fetal circulation, tetralogy of Fallot, anotia, cleft lip and palate 
and chondrodystrophy.  
None of the New congenital anomalies reported were determined by the investigator to be related to 
study vaccine or placebo. 
The  CHMP  agrees  that  there  is  no  identified  causal  relationship  between  any  of  the  congenital 
anomalies and administration of qHPV. 
(cid:190) Postmarketing data 
qHPV was first licensed on 01-June-2006 in Mexico. Two 6-month Periodic Safety Update Reports 
(PSURs) for qHPV for the periods of 01-June-2006 thru 30-Nov-2006 and for 01-Dec-2006 thru 31-
May-2007 are complete. 
Of  the  total  number  of  4586  AE  reports  received  during  this  time  period,  317  (7%)  reports  were 
considered serious. The majority (3947 or 86%) of reports originated in the United States. 
The  EU  SPC  has  been  updated  to  include  Syncope,  Dizziness,  Nausea,  Vomiting,  Hypersensitivity 
reactions  including  anaphylactic/anaphylactoid  reactions,  bronchospasm  and  urticaria    through  the 
Type II variation II/05 which received an EU Commission Decision on 26 July 2007. In the scope of 
the current variation, the MAH proposes to update section 4.8 of the EU SPC and section 4.0 of the 
PL,  with  the  following  adverse  events:  Lymphadenopathy,  Headache  and  Guillain-Barré  Syndrome 
(GBS). The decision to include the adverse events Lymphadenopathy, Headache and Guillain-Barré 
Syndrome (GBS) was  made subsequent to the review of the safety profile of the product. 
included  positive 
Lymphadenopathy 
A review of the NWARS database for the period 11 September 2006 to 11 April 2007 identified 18 
reports  of  lymphadenopathy  temporally associated with the administration of qHPV. Three of these 
reports 
reports  with  specified  unilateral 
lymphadenopathy.  Four  of  the  7  reports  included  the  time  to  onset  of  lymphadenopathy  post 
vaccination  3-11  days.  The  remaining  8  reports  involved  4  which  indicated  only  that  the  patients 
experienced  “swollen  glands”  and  2  reports  which  indicated  experience  of  swollen  lymphnodes  in 
more  than  one  area.  Time  to  onset  was  1-5  days.  The  remaining  reports  were  confounded  by  other 
factors.  
rechallenges.  There  were  7 
Headache 
A review of the NWARS database for the period 11September 2006 to 11 April 2007 identified 62 
reports of headache temporally associated with the administration of qHPV. Five of these events were 
assessed  as  serious  and  57  as  non-serious.  Headache  was  most  often  reported  with  nausea  (20) 
dizziness(20), pyrexia (12), vomiting (6) and myalgia/arthralgia (6). 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) 
A  review  of  the  NWARS  database  for  the  period  11  September  2006  to  11-Apr-2007  identified 
14 reports of Guillain Barré syndrome temporally associated with the administration of qHPV. Five of 
the 14 reports included minimal detailed information. However, 2 of the reports included the time to 
onset of GBS post-vaccination Day 8 and Day 9. One case developed GBS on Day 15 after the second 
dose of qHPV.  Assessment of seven of the remaining 9 reports was confounded by other plausible 
factors.  Five  of  7  reports  involved  patients  who  received  concomitant  quadrivalent  meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine on the same date. Additionally one of these 7 patients has a working diagnosis of 
GBS, not yet confirmed. Another patient, who received concomitant meningococcal vaccine and had a 
LP  confirmed  GBS  also  had  MRI  results  showing  an  old  chronic,  subarachnoid  cyst.  Follow-up 
information on a third patient that received concomitant meningococcal vaccine with EMG strongly 
positive  for  GBS  revealed  that  the  patients  onset  of  symptoms  preceded  the  vaccination.  The  2 
remaining reports including confounding factors involved one case with multiple medical conditions 
and  one  case  with  a  family  history  of  MS  who  experienced  an  URI  before  onset  of  GBS.  The 
remaining two reports of GBS included abnormal EMG. The time to onset of GBS post vaccination 
was provided in 12 of the 14 reports and ranged from 6 to 15 days with a median of 9 days. Half of 
the cases had confounders. Five of the cases without confounders included little information to make 
an assessment. Two cases provided sufficient information to assess them as likely cases of GBS. The 
onset was 9-14  days from vaccination. The cause of GBS remains unknown but may involve a non-
specific stimulus. 
As the experiences were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not possible to 
estimate the frequency or to establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.   
Non-specific arthritis/ arthropathy 
The MAH revised in section 4.8 the number of cases of non-specific arthritis/ arthropathy: 26 cases 
(19 in the Gardasil group and 7 in the placebo group) reported as any new medical conditions during 
the follow up of up to four years.  
The  reports  of  the  19  cases  of  athralgia/arthropathy  in  temporal  relationship  to  administration  of 
Gardasil occurred after 2 months (n=3), 6 months (n=4), 7 months (n=1), 12 months (n=1), 24 months 
(n=6),  30  months  (n=2)  and  36  months  (n=2.)    The  7  placebo  related reports occurred at month 12 
(n=1),  month  18  (n=2),  month  24  (n=2)  and  month  36  (n=2).  Adjudication  of  relatedness  and/or 
causality  was  not  accounted  for  although  considering  that  some  of  these  reactions  might  be  of 
autoimmune  origin  a  possible  relationship  can  not  be  excluded.  These  reactions  should  be 
continuously monitored and commented on in the future PSURs. 
Neurological reactions 
Furthermore, a recent follow-up measure concerned reports on transverse myelitis, leukoencephalitis, 
optic  neuritis,  diplopia,  vision  blurred,  papilloedema  and  demyelinating  disorders  in  relation  to 
vaccination  with  qHPV.  The  MAH  provided  updates  and  discussion  of  the  cases  of  these  events. 
Additional  information  was  received  regarding  16  cases  of  grand  mal  convulsion  and  64  cases  of 
convulsion.  These  reactions  were  evaluated  within  the  PSUR  3  and  no  changes  to  the  SPC  are 
required at the moment. 
Adenopathies 
Additional analysis on a safety review of cases of adenopathies reported as temporally associated with 
the administration of Gardasil was requested by the CHMP and the results should be presented in the 
next PSUR. 
Discussion 
Overall the post marketing experiences with qHPV has confirmed a favourable safety profile with a 
low frequency of reported serious adverse experiences. The data reviewed do not include any new or 
unexpected reports of adverse events. 
The MAH proposes to change the term for the adverse reaction of “bleeding at the injection site” into 
the MedDRA preferred term "injection site bruising" for accuracy.  At the time of the study coding, 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bruising  at  the  injection  site  coded  up  to  "Hemorrhage"  in  the  MedDRA  system  which  then  was 
changed to the word "bleeding" for the product information. In fact the subjects experienced bruising 
at  the  injection  site.    The  MedDRA  code  has  now  been  changed  and  injection  site  bruising  is  a 
preferred term. The CHMP agrees with this change. 
The reports above discussed on GBS and Headache support the inclusion of these adverse reactions in 
the SPC section of Post Marketing experience. 
The requested supplementary information has been provided. 
Additional  safety  information  on  reports  on  lymphadenopathy  was  received  during  the  assessment 
period. The PSUR 3 (covering period 1/06/2007-30/11/2007) reports on 18 cases of lymphadenopathy 
temporally  associated  with  vaccination  identified  for  the  period  of  market  introduction  to  11-Apr-
2007. Three of these reports include positive re-challenge. Because at least 2 of 3 cases of positive re-
challenge  were  positive  it  is  considered  biologically  plausible  that  vaccination  could  be  causally 
associated with lymphadenopathy. This supports the inclusion of lymphadenopathy in section 4.8 of 
the SPC. 
The  19  reported  cases  of  arthritis/arthropathy  occurred  between  2  and  36  months  after  vaccination 
although adjudication of relatedness and/or causality was not accounted for. In consideration of that 
some  of  these  reactions  may  be  of  autoimmune  origin  a  possible  relationship  cannot  be  excluded. 
These cases are also discussed in PSUR 3. The inclusion in the SPC is considered adequate. 
Regarding the adverse reactions of autoimmune diseases, i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis 
(MS),  Chron´s  disease  and  autoimmune  thyroiditis  it  is  considered  that  the  occurrence  of  these 
adverse events will presently not deserve inclusion in the SPC. The majority of autoimmune diseases 
occurred  12  to  48  months  post  vaccination.  Only  one  case  of  autoimmune  thyroiditis  occurred  in 
temporal relatedness to vaccination at Month 2. Causality has not been clearly defined in any of these 
reports.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  continue  close  monitoring  of  all  autoimmune  diseases  and  to 
present such reports in the future PSURs in cumulative way.  
A  cumulative  analysis  of  neurologic  adverse  events  was  evaluated  in  PSUR  3.  The  MAH  should 
continue to monitor these adverse reactions. 
The safety of the product and the specific adverse events:

will continue to be thoroughly monitored through PSURs.

Overall discussion and Benefit/Risk Assessment 
The major objections were resolved as the claims for vulvar and vaginal cancers as well as for VIN 1 
and  VaIN  1  were  withdrawn  by  the  MAH.  The  supplementary  data  allowed  for  a  conclusion  that 
Gardasil  is  efficacious  against  HPV  16/18-related  VaIN  2/3,  which  support  the  inclusion  of  this 
condition in the indication. The recent EU guideline of the EU Commission/IARC on the management 
of  CIN  1  supported  that  this  low-grade  cervical  lesion  is  a  clinically  relevant  endpoint  requiring 
clinical  follow-up,  diagnostic  procedures,  and  in  selected  cases,  therapeutic  intervention.  Since  the 
MAH was requested to simplify the wording of the indication (according to the SPC guideline and to 
be  better  understood  by  prescribers)  to  include  premalignant  genital  lesions,  the  CHMP  considered 
that there was no need to specifically mention CIN 1 in section 4.1. Because of the simplified wording 
for the therapeutic indication the MAH proposed the addition of an introductory sentence in section 
5.1 specifying the type of lesions included in premalignant genital lesions. The CHMP, however, did 
not  consider  it  applicable  to  CIN  1.  Low-grade  cervical  intraepithelial  lesions  are  not  considered 
premalignant  and  CIN  1  should  not  be  included  in  the  paragraph  referred  on  section  5.1.  Vaccine 
efficacy against CIN 1 is already mentioned elsewhere in section 5.1. 
All other concerns were resolved. Overall the post marketing experiences with qHPV has confirmed a 
favourable  safety  profile  with  a  low  frequency  of  reported  serious  adverse  experiences.  The  data 
reviewed do not include any new or unexpected reports of adverse events. 
The MAH has committed to submit an updated RMP at the time point of the next PSUR addressing 
some specified safety and post-marketing surveillance issues. 
In  conclusion,  the  Benefit/Risk  ratio  for  Gardasil  in  the  indication  for  prevention  of  high-grade 
vaginal dysplastic lesions (VaIN 2/3) is considered positive. Therefore, the therapeutic indication for 
Gardasil  for  the  prevention  of  premalignant  genital  lesions  (cervical,  vulvar  and  vaginal),  cervical 
cancer  and  external  genital  warts  (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus 
(HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 was endorsed by the CHMP.

Changes to the product information 
Further  to  the  assessment  of  the  different  proposals  of  the  MAH  to  amend the Product Information 
and  in  the  light  of  the  assessment  of  the  submitted  data,  the  Product  Information  was  revised  as 
follows: 
SPC 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication”  
The MAH’s initially proposed to extend the approved indication to include protection against vulvar 
and vaginal cancer, VIN 1, VaIN 1/2/3 and CIN 1. 
There is sufficient evidence to allow an indication to include protection against VaIN 2/3. The claims 
for vulvar and VIN 1 and VaIN 1 were not accepted by the CHMP and were withdrawn by the MAH.  
The CHMP considered that the wording proposed by the MAH including the different endpoint was 
too complex and could be simplified to be better understood by the prescribers. 
The  MAH´s  claim  for  prevention  of  “high-grade  cervical  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (CIN  2/3),  high-
grade  vulvar  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (VIN  2/3)  and  high-grade  vaginal  intraepithelial  neoplasia 
(VaIN  2/3)”  is  covered  by  the  broader  term  of  “premalignant  genital  lesions”  and  a  description  on 
section 5.1. 
The  MAH  acknowledges  the  CHMP  position  and  submitted  a  revised  wording  which  was  agreed 
with, as follows:  
“Gardasil  is  a  vaccine  for  the  prevention  of  premalignant  genital  lesions  (cervical,  vulvar  and 
vaginal),  cervical  cancer  and  external  genital  warts  (condyloma  acuminata)  causally  related  to 
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (see section 5.1).” 
Section 4.2 “Posology and method of administration”  
The  sentence  on  intravascular,  subcutaneous  and  intradermal  administration  was  reformulated  for 
clarity. 
A sentence was introduced to recommend that subjects who receive a first dose of Gardasil complete 
the 3-dose vaccination course with Gardasil . 
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use”  
A  paragraph  was  added  to  inform  health  care  professionals that there no safety, immunogenicity or 
efficacy data is available to support interchangeability of Gardasil with other HPV vaccines. 
Section  4.6 “Pregnancy and lactation” 
The  MAH  proposed  to  update  the  numbers  on  pregnant  women  and  cases  of  congenital  anomalies 
observed. The CHMP agreed with this proposal. 
Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” 
For clarity bleeding was replaced by bruising. 
The numbers of subjects experiencing arthritis/arthropathy were updated. 
The post marketing experience section was revised to include lymphadenopathy, GBS and headache. 
Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties”  
The  second  paragraph  on  mechanism  of  action  was  updated  based  on  data  supported  by  literature 
concerning the percentages of the different diseases/endpoints resulting from HPV infections. 
A  paragraph  was  introduced  to  clarify  the  term  "premalignant  genital  lesions"  in  section  4.1.  that 
corresponds 
intraepithelial  neoplasia  (CIN  2/3),  high-grade  vulvar 
intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/3) and high-grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/3).

The  MAH  proposed  to  update  the  section  on  clinical  studies  based  on  the  results  of  the  analysis 
submitted. The CHMP proposed the revision of the text submitted. 
Efficacy  results  are  presented  for  the  combined  analysis  of  study  protocols.  The  efficacy  for  HPV 
16/18 related CIN 2/3 or AIS is  based on data from protocols 005 (16-related endpoints only), 007, 
013, and 015. The efficacy for all other endpoints is based on protocols 007, 013, and 015. Results of 
individual studies support the results from the combined analysis. 
Efficacy results are presented for 2- and 3-years results for the main endpoints and for the different 
relevant populations: subjects naïve to the relevant vaccine HPV type and subjects with and without 
prior infection or disease due to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18. 
Data  on  Table  3  concerning  Immunogenicity  bridging  between  9-  to  15-year-old  male  and  female 
subjects  and 16- to 26-year-old adult women (per-protocol population) based on titres of antibodies 
directed against known neutralizing epitopes as measured by cLIA was updated as submitted by the 
MAH. 
Annex IIB 
Annex II was updated concerning the RMP. 
PL 
The PL was updated in accordance with the changes proposed to the SPC. 
The MAH has agreed with the changes as proposed by the CHMP.

CONCLUSION 
On  24  April  2008  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet subject 
to additional follow up measures undertaken.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
ELOCTA can be used for all age groups. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia. 
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels (by one-stage clotting or 
chromogenic assays) is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. 
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and 
recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight and overweight patients. In 
the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means 
of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.  
When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining 
factor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly 
affected by both the type of the aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Also there can be 
significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based one stage clotting assay and the 
chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance particularly when changing the laboratory 
and/or reagent used in the assay. 
Posology 
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the 
location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition.  
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in IU, which are related to the current WHO 
standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative 
to normal human plasma) or in IU (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). 
One IU of recombinant factor VIII Fc activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one mL of 
normal human plasma. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On-demand treatment 
The calculation of the required dose of recombinant factor VIII Fc is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU 
factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dL. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:  
Required units = body weight (kg) × desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) × 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL) 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical 
effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. Table 1 can be used to guide 
dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Repeat injection every 12 to 24 hours for at 
least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as 
indicated by pain is resolved or healing is 
achieved. 1 
Repeat injection every 12 to 24 hours for 3-4 
days or more until pain and acute disability 
are resolved. 1 
Repeat injection every 8 to 24 hours until 
threat is resolved. 
Repeat injection every 24 hours, for at least 1 
day, until healing is achieved. 
Repeat injection every 8 to 24 hours as 
necessary until adequate wound healing, then 
therapy at least for another 7 days to maintain 
a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dL). 
1 In some patients and circumstances the dosing interval can be prolonged up to 36 hours. See section 5.2 for 
pharmacokinetic data. 
Prophylaxis  
For long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose is 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 3 
to 5 days. The dose may be adjusted based on patient response in the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg (see section 5.1 
and 5.2).  
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary. 
Elderly 
There is limited experience in patients ≥65 years.

Paediatric population 
For children below the age of 12, more frequent or higher doses may be required (see section 5.1). For 
adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the same as for adults.  
Method of administration  
ELOCTA is for intravenous use. 
ELOCTA should be injected intravenously over several minutes. The rate of administration should be 
determined by the patient’s comfort level and should not exceed 10 mL/min.  
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity 
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with ELOCTA. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact their 
physician. Patients should be informed of the signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised 
urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.  
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins directed 
against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per mL of plasma 
using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of the disease as well 
as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure days but continues 
throughout life although the risk is uncommon. 
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre posing 
less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. 
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for the 
development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, 
testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of inhibitor, 
factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. Management of 
such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of haemophilia and factor VIII 
inhibitors. 
Cardiovascular events 
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the 
cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including local 
infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Traceability  
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the 
administered product should be clearly recorded.

Paediatric population  
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults, children and adolescents. 
Excipient related considerations 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
However, depending on the body weight and posology, the patient could receive more than one vial (see 
section 2 for information on content per vial). This should be taken into consideration by patients on a 
controlled sodium diet. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) with other medicinal products have been reported. 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. A placental transfer study in mice 
was conducted with ELOCTA (see section 5.3). Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, 
experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, 
factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
ELOCTA has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion 
site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, 
tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed rarely and may in some 
cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). 
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated with 
factor VIII, including with ELOCTA. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an 
insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be 
contacted. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The Table 2 presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred 
Term Level). Frequencies of adverse reactions are based on clinical studies with a total of 379 patients with 
severe haemophilia A, of which 276 were previously treated patients (PTPs) and 103 were previously 
untreated patients (PUPs). See section 5.1 for additional details on the clinical studies. 
Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common 
(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von Willebrand 
factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to 
von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated 
factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts 
prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is an X-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of functional 
factor VIII:C and results in bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a 
result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, 
thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. 
Of note, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and 
between different clinical studies. 
ELOCTA (efmoroctocog alfa) is a fully recombinant fusion protein with extended half-life. ELOCTA is 
comprised of recombinant B-domain deleted human coagulation factor VIII covalently linked to the 
Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1. The Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 binds to the neonatal 
Fc receptor. This receptor is expressed throughout life and is part of a naturally occurring pathway that 
protects immunoglobulins from lysosomal degradation by cycling these proteins back into circulation, 
resulting in their long plasma half-life. Efmoroctocog alfa binds to neonatal Fc receptor thereby utilising this 
same naturally occurring pathway to delay lysosomal degradation and allow for longer plasma half-life than 
endogenous factor VIII. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ELOCTA in previously treated patients (PTPs) were evaluated 
in 2 multinational, open-label, pivotal phase 3 studies, Study I and Study II (see Paediatric population), and 
an extension study (Study III) with a duration of up to four years. In total 276 PTPs were followed for a total 
of 80,848 exposure days with a median of 294 (range 1-735) exposure days per patient. In addition, a phase 3 
study (Study IV) was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ELOCTA in previously untreated 
patients (PUPs) (see Paediatric population). 
Study I enrolled 165 previously treated male patients (12 to 65 years of age) with severe haemophilia A. 
Subjects on prophylaxis regimens prior to entering the study were assigned to the individualised prophylaxis 
arm. Subjects on on-demand therapy prior to entry either entered the individualised prophylaxis arm or were 
randomised to the weekly prophylaxis or on-demand arms. 
Prophylaxis regimens: 
Individualised prophylaxis: 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days. 
Weekly prophylaxis: 65 IU/kg 
Out of 153 subjects who completed Study I, 150 were enrolled onto Study III (extension study). Median total 
time on Study I+III was 4.2 years and median number of exposure days was 309. 
Individualised prophylaxis: Median annual factor consumption was 4212 IU/kg (min. 2877, max. 7943) in 
Study I and 4223 IU/kg (min. 2668, max 8317) in Study III. Respective median Annualized Bleed Rate 
(ABR) was 1.60 (min. 0, max. 18.2) and 0.74 (min. 0, max. 15.6). 
Weekly prophylaxis: Median annual factor consumption was 3805 IU/kg (min. 3353, max. 6196) in Study I 
and 3510 IU/kg (min. 2758, max. 3984) in Study III. Respective median ABR was 3.59 (min. 0, max. 58.0) 
and 2.24 (min. 0, max. 17.2). 
On-demand treatment: Median annual factor consumption was 1039 IU/kg (min. 280, max. 3571) for 
23 patients randomised to the on-demand treatment arm in Study I and 671 IU/kg (min. 286, max. 913) for 
6 patients remaining on on-demand treatment for at least one year in Study III. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects that switched from on-demand treatment to weekly prophylaxis during Study III had a median ABR 
of 1.67. 
Treatment of bleeding: 2490 bleeding events were treated during Study I and III with a median dose of 
43.8 IU/kg (min. 13.0, max. 172.8) to control each bleed. 79.2 % of first injections were rated as excellent or 
good by the patients. 
Perioperative management (surgical prophylaxis): A total of 48 major surgical procedures were performed 
and assessed in 34 subjects in Study I and Study III. The haemostatic response was rated by the physicians as 
excellent in 41 and as good in 3 of 44 major surgeries. Median dose to maintain haemostasis during surgery 
was 60.6 IU/kg (min. 38, max. 158).  
Paediatric population 
Study II enrolled a total of 71 previously treated male paediatric patients <12 years of age with severe 
haemophilia A. Of the 71 enrolled subjects, 69 received at least 1 dose of ELOCTA and were evaluable for 
efficacy (35 were <6 years of age and 34 were 6 to <12 years of age). The starting prophylactic regimen 
consisted of 25 IU/kg on the first day followed by 50 IU/kg on the fourth day. Dosing of up to 80 IU/kg and 
a dosing interval as short as 2 days was allowed and used in a limited number of patients. Out of 67 subjects 
having completed Study II, 61 enrolled onto Study III (extension study). Median total time on study II+III 
was 3.4 years and median number of exposure days was 332. 
Prophylaxis, age <6 years: Median dose interval was 3.50 days in Study II and Study III. Median annual 
factor consumption was 5146 IU/kg (min. 3695, max. 8474) in Study II and 5418 IU/kg (min. 3435, max. 
9564) in Study III. Respective median Annualized Bleed Rate (ABR) was 0.00 (min. 0, max. 10.5) and 1.18 
(min. 0, max. 9.2). 
Prophylaxis, age 6 up to 12 years: Median dose interval was 3.49 days in Study II and 3.50 days in Study III. 
Median annual factor consumption was 4700 IU/kg (min. 3819, max. 8230 IU/kg) in Study II and 
4990 IU/kg (min. 3856, max. 9527) in Study III. Respective median ABR was 2.01 (min. 0, max. 27.2) and 
1.59 (min. 0, max. 8.0). 
12 adolescent subjects age 12 up to 18 years were included in the adult study population on prophylactic 
treatment. Median annual factor consumption was 5572 IU/kg (min. 3849, max. 7035) in Study I and 
4456 IU/kg (min. 3563, max. 8011) in Study III. Respective median ABR was 1.92 (min. 0, max. 7.1) and 
1.25 (min. 0, max. 9.5). 
Treatment of bleeding: During Studies II and III, 447 bleeding events were treated with a median dose of 
63 IU/kg (min. 28, max. 186) to control each bleed. 90.2 % of first injections were rated as excellent or good 
by the patients and their caregivers. 
Study IV evaluated 103 male previously untreated patients (PUPs) <6 years of age with severe 
haemophilia A. Patients were followed for a total of 11,255 exposure days with a median of 100 (range 
0-649) exposure days per patient. Most subjects started on episodic treatment (N=81) with subsequent 
transition to prophylaxis (N=69). At any time during the study, 89 PUPs received prophylaxis. The 
recommended initial dose on prophylaxis was 25–80 IU/kg at 3–5-day intervals. For subjects on 
prophylaxis, the median average weekly dose was 101.4 IU/kg (range: 28.5-776.3 IU/kg) and the 
median dosing interval was 3.87 days (range 1.1 to 7 days). Median annual factor consumption was 
3971.4 IU/kg. Annualized Bleeding Rate was 1.49 (min. 0.0, max. 18.7). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
All pharmacokinetic studies with ELOCTA were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
haemophilia A. Data presented in this section were obtained by chromogenic and one-stage clotting assays. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters from the chromogenic assay data were similar to those derived for the 
one-stage assay. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated in 28 subjects (≥15 years) receiving ELOCTA (rFVIIIFc). 
Following a washout period of at least 96 hours (4 days), the subjects received a single dose of 50 IU/kg of 
ELOCTA. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected pre-dose and then subsequently at 7 time points up to 
120 hours (5 days) post-dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters after 50 IU/kg dose of ELOCTA are presented in 
Tables 3 and 4.

* Pharmacokinetic parameters in 12 to <18 years included subjects from all the arms in Study I with 
different sampling schemes  
In comparison with adolescents and adults, children less than 12 years of age may have a higher clearance 
and a shorter half-life which is consistent with observations of other coagulation factors. These differences 
should be taken into account when dosing. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on acute and repeated dose toxicity studies 
(which included assessments of local toxicity and safety pharmacology). Studies to investigate genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity, toxicity to reproduction or embryo-foetal development have not been conducted. In a 
placental transfer study, ELOCTA has been shown to cross the placenta in small amounts in mice.

Additional information on reconstitution and administration: 
ELOCTA is administered by intravenous (IV) injection after dissolving the powder for injection with the 
solvent supplied in the pre-filled syringe. ELOCTA pack contains: 
A) 1 Powder vial 
B) 3 mL solvent in pre-filled syringe 
C) 1 Plunger rod  
D) 1 Vial adapter 
E) 1 Infusion set 
F) 2 Alcohol swabs 
G) 2 Plasters  
H) 1 Gauze pad 
ELOCTA should not be mixed with other solutions for injection or infusion. 
Wash your hands before opening the pack. 
Preparation: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Check the name and strength of the package, to make sure it contains the correct medicine. 
Check the expiry date on the ELOCTA carton. Do not use if the medicine has expired. 
If ELOCTA has been stored in a refrigerator, allow the vial of ELOCTA (A) and the syringe 
with solvent (B) to reach room temperature before use. Do not use external heat. 
Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Remove the plastic flip-top 
cap from the ELOCTA vial. 
4.  Wipe the top of the vial with one of the alcohol swabs (F) 
provided in the pack, and allow to air dry. Do not touch the top of 
the vial or allow it to touch anything else once wiped. 
5. 
6. 
Peel back the protective paper lid from the clear plastic vial adapter (D). Do not remove the 
adapter from its protective cap. Do not touch the inside of the vial adapter package. 
Place the vial on a flat surface. Hold the vial adapter in its 
protective cap and place it squarely over the top of the vial. Press 
down firmly until the adapter snaps into place on top of the vial, 
with the adapter spike penetrating the vial stopper.

7. 
8. 
Attach the plunger rod (C) to the solvent syringe by inserting the 
tip of the plunger rod into the opening in the syringe plunger. Turn 
the plunger rod firmly clockwise until it is securely seated in the 
syringe plunger. 
Break off the white, tamper-resistant, plastic cap from the solvent 
syringe by bending at the perforation cap until it snaps off. Set the 
cap aside by placing it with the top down on a flat surface. Do not 
touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. 
9. 
Lift the protective cap away from the adapter and discard. 
10.   Connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by inserting the tip 
of the syringe into the adapter opening. Firmly push and turn the 
syringe clockwise until it is securely connected. 
11.  Slowly depress the plunger rod to inject all the solvent into the  
ELOCTA vial. 
12.  With the syringe still connected to the adapter and the plunger rod 
pressed down, gently swirl the vial until the powder is dissolved.  
Do not shake. 
13.  The final solution must be inspected visually before administration. The solution should appear 
clear to slightly opalescent and colourless. Do not use the solution if cloudy or contains visible 
particles. 
14.  Ensuring that the syringe plunger rod is still fully pressed down, 
invert the vial. Slowly pull on the plunger rod to draw back all the 
solution through the vial adapter into the syringe. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15.  Detach the syringe from the vial adapter by gently pulling and 
turning the vial counterclockwise. 
Note: If you use more than one vial of ELOCTA per injection, each vial should be prepared separately 
as per the previous instructions (steps 1 to 13) and the solvent syringe should be removed, leaving the 
vial adapter in place. A single large luer lock syringe may be used to draw back the prepared contents 
of each of the individual vials. 
16.  Discard the vial and the adapter. 
Note: If the solution is not to be used immediately, the syringe cap should be carefully put back on the 
syringe tip. Do not touch the syringe tip or the inside of the cap. 
After preparation, ELOCTA can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 hours before administration. 
After this time, the prepared ELOCTA should be discarded. Protect from direct sunlight. 
Administration (Intravenous injection): 
ELOCTA should be administered using the infusion set (E) provided in this pack. 
1. 
Open the infusion set package and remove the cap at the end of 
the tubing. Attach the syringe with the prepared ELOCTA 
solution to the end of the infusion set tubing by turning 
clockwise. 
2. 
If needed apply a tourniquet and prepare the injection site by wiping the skin well with the 
other alcohol swab provided in the pack. 
3. 
4. 
Remove any air in the infusion set tubing by slowly depressing on the plunger rod until liquid 
has reached the infusion set needle. Do not push the solution through the needle. Remove the 
clear plastic protective cover from the needle. 
Insert the infusion set needle into a vein as instructed by your doctor or nurse and remove the 
tourniquet. If preferred, you may use one of the plasters (G) provided in the pack to hold the 
plastic wings of the needle in place at the injection site. The prepared product should be 
injected intravenously over several minutes. Your doctor may change your recommended 
injection rate to make it more comfortable for you. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. 
After completing the injection and removing the needle, you 
should fold over the needle protector and snap it over the needle. 
6. 
Please safely dispose of the used needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty vial 
in an appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of 
properly. Do not reuse equipment. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What ELOCTA is and what it is used for 
ELOCTA contains the active substance efmoroctocog alfa, a recombinant coagulation factor VIII, Fc fusion 
protein. Factor VIII is a protein produced naturally in the body and is necessary for the blood to form clots 
and stop bleeding.  
ELOCTA is a medicine used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in all age groups of patients with 
haemophilia A (inherited bleeding disorder caused by factor VIII deficiency). 
ELOCTA is prepared by recombinant technology without addition of any human- or animal-derived 
components in the manufacturing process.  
How ELOCTA works 
In patients with haemophilia A, factor VIII is missing or not working properly. ELOCTA is used to replace 
the missing or deficient factor VIII. ELOCTA increases factor VIII level in the blood and temporarily 
corrects the bleeding tendency. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use ELOCTA 
Do not use ELOCTA: 
• 
if you are allergic to efmoroctocog alfa or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ELOCTA. 
• 
• 
There is a small chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ELOCTA. Signs of allergic reactions may include generalised itching, hives, tightness of 
the chest, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If any of these symptoms occur, stop the 
injection immediately and contact your doctor. 
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
your or your child’s bleeding is not being controlled with ELOCTA, tell your doctor immediately. 
Cardiovascular events 
If you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, take special care when using factor VIII medicines 
and talk to your doctor. 
Catheter-related complications 
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including local 
infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Documentation 
It is strongly recommended that every time ELOCTA is given, the name and batch number of the product are 
recorded. 
Other medicines and ELOCTA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines  
No effects on ability to drive or use of machines have been observed. 
ELOCTA contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
However, depending on your body weight and dose, you could receive more than one vial. This should be 
taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. 
3. 
How to use ELOCTA 
Treatment with ELOCTA will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you (see Instructions for preparation 
and administration). Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
ELOCTA is given as an injection into a vein. Your doctor will calculate the dose of ELOCTA (in 
International Units or “IU”) depending on your individual needs for factor VIII replacement therapy and on 
whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. Talk to your doctor if you think that your bleeding 
is not being controlled with the dose you receive. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How often you need an injection will depend on how well ELOCTA is working for you. Your doctor will 
perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels in your blood.  
Treatment of bleeding  
The dose of ELOCTA is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be achieved. 
The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. 
Prevention of bleeding 
The usual dose of ELOCTA is 50 IU per kg of body weight, given every 3 to 5 days. The dose may be 
adjusted by your doctor in the range of 25 to 65 IU per kg of body weight. In some cases, especially in 
younger patients, shorter dosing intervals or higher doses may be necessary. 
Use in children and adolescents 
ELOCTA can be used in children and adolescents of all ages. In children below the age of 12, higher doses 
or more frequent injections may be needed. 
If you use more ELOCTA than you should 
Tell your doctor as soon as possible. You should always use ELOCTA exactly as your doctor has told you, 
check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
If you forget to use ELOCTA 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take your dose as soon as you remember and 
then resume your normal dosing schedule. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you stop using ELOCTA 
Do not stop using ELOCTA without consulting your doctor. If you stop using ELOCTA you may no longer 
be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not stop. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic reaction) occur, the injection must be stopped immediately. 
You must contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms of allergic 
reactions: swelling of the face, rash, generalised itching, hives, tightness of the chest, difficulty breathing, 
burning and stinging at the injection site, chills, flushing, headache, low blood pressure, general feeling of 
being unwell, nausea, restlessness and fast heartbeat, feeling dizzy or loss of consciousness. 
For children previously untreated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form 
very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients); however, patients who have received previous treatment with

Preparation: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Check the name and strength of the package, to make sure it contains the correct medicine. 
Check the expiry date on the ELOCTA carton. Do not use if the medicine has expired. 
If ELOCTA has been stored in a refrigerator, allow the vial of ELOCTA (A) and the syringe 
with solvent (B) to reach room temperature before use. Do not use external heat. 
Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Remove the plastic flip-top 
cap from the ELOCTA vial. 
4.  Wipe the top of the vial with one of the alcohol swabs (F) 
provided in the pack, and allow to air dry. Do not touch the top of 
the vial or allow it to touch anything else once wiped. 
5. 
6. 
Peel back the protective paper lid from the clear plastic vial adapter (D). Do not remove the 
adapter from its protective cap. Do not touch the inside of the vial adapter package. 
Place the vial on a flat surface. Hold the vial adapter in its 
protective cap and place it squarely over the top of the vial. Press 
down firmly until the adapter snaps into place on top of the vial, 
with the adapter spike penetrating the vial stopper.

7. 
8. 
Attach the plunger rod (C) to the solvent syringe by inserting the 
tip of the plunger rod into the opening in the syringe plunger. Turn 
the plunger rod firmly clockwise until it is securely seated in the 
syringe plunger. 
Break off the white, tamper-resistant, plastic cap from the solvent 
syringe by bending at the perforation cap until it snaps off. Set the 
cap aside by placing it with the top down on a flat surface. Do not 
touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. 
9. 
Lift the protective cap away from the adapter and discard. 
10.  Connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by inserting the tip 
of the syringe into the adapter opening. Firmly push and turn the 
syringe clockwise until it is securely connected. 
11.  Slowly depress the plunger rod to inject all the solvent into the 
ELOCTA vial. 
12.  With the syringe still connected to the adapter and the plunger rod 
pressed down, gently swirl the vial until the powder is dissolved. 
Do not shake. 
13.  The final solution must be inspected visually before administration. The solution should appear 
clear to slightly opalescent and colourless. Do not use the solution if cloudy or contains visible 
particles. 
14.  Ensuring that the syringe plunger rod is still fully pressed down, 
invert the vial. Slowly pull on the plunger rod to draw back all the 
solution through the vial adapter into the syringe.

15.  Detach the syringe from the vial adapter by gently pulling and 
turning the vial counterclockwise. 
Note: If you use more than one vial of ELOCTA per injection, each vial should be prepared separately 
as per the previous instructions (steps 1 to 13) and the solvent syringe should be removed, leaving the 
vial adapter in place. A single large luer lock syringe may be used to draw back the prepared contents 
of each of the individual vials. 
16.  Discard the vial and the adapter. 
Note: If the solution is not to be used immediately, the syringe cap should be carefully put back on the 
syringe tip. Do not touch the syringe tip or the inside of the cap. 
After preparation, ELOCTA can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 hours before administration. 
After this time, the prepared ELOCTA should be discarded. Protect from direct sunlight. 
Administration (Intravenous injection): 
ELOCTA should be administered using the infusion set (E) provided in this pack. 
1. 
Open the infusion set package and remove the cap at the end of the 
tubing. Attach the syringe with the prepared ELOCTA solution to 
the end of the infusion set tubing by turning clockwise. 
2. 
If needed apply a tourniquet and prepare the injection site by wiping the skin well with the other 
alcohol swab provided in the pack. 
3. 
4. 
Remove any air in the infusion set tubing by slowly depressing on the plunger rod until liquid 
has reached the infusion set needle. Do not push the solution through the needle. Remove the 
clear plastic protective cover from the needle. 
Insert the infusion set needle into a vein as instructed by your doctor or nurse and remove the 
tourniquet. If preferred, you may use one of the plasters (G) provided in the pack to hold the 
plastic wings of the needle in place at the injection site. The prepared product should be injected 
intravenously over several minutes. Your doctor may change your recommended injection rate 
to make it more comfortable for you. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. 
After completing the injection and removing the needle, you 
should fold over the needle protector and snap it over the needle. 
6. 
Please safely dispose of the used needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty vial in 
an appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of 
properly. Do not reuse equipment.

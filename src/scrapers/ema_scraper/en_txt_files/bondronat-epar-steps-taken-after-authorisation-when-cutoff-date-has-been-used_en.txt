On  19  July  1999  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  an  application  for  a  Type  I

amendments in the relevant sections of the Commission Decision. The European Commission 
amended the Decision on 16 November 1999. 
In accordance with Article 10(3) of Council Directive 92/27 EEC of 31 March 1992, the EMEA

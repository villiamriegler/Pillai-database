I. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1.1. 
Introduction 
Bevacizumab  (Bv)  is  a  recombinant  humanized  anti-vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (anti-VEGF) 
monoclonal  antibody  (IgG1)  that  selectively  binds  to  and  neutralizes  the  biologic  activity  of  human 
vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF).  Increased  levels  of  VEGF  expression  have  been  found  in 
many  human  malignancies  examined  to  date,  including  tumours  of  the  lung,  breast,  thyroid, 
gastrointestinal  tract,  kidney,  bladder,  ovary,  cervix  and  pancreas,  as  well  as  angiosarcomas  and 
glioblastomas. Increased VEGF serum levels have been correlated with poor survival. 
Bevacizumab has been developed for the treatment of a number of malignancies and has completed Phase 
III  clinical  trials  in  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  (mCRC),  non  squamous  non–small  cell  lung  cancer 
(NSCLC),  metastatic  breast  cancer  (mBC),  metastatic  renal  cell  carcinoma  (mRCC)  and  metastatic 
pancreatic cancer. On the basis of having been shown to significantly prolong survival when added to 5-
FU-based  and  irinotecan  containing  first-line  chemotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  mCRC,  bevacizumab 
received Marketing Authorization approval in this indication globally (including the USA and EU). Since 
initial approval, bevacizumab has received Marketing Authorization approval for the first-line treatment of 
patients with mBC, non squamous NSCLC and mRCC. 
The data submitted in this dossier support an extension of the current bevacizumab indication to include 
the  use  of  bevacizumab  alone  or  in  combination  with  irinotecan  in  patients  with  glioblastoma  (WHO 
Grade IV malignant glioma) after relapse. 
1.2  Clinical aspects 
Brain tumours account for 85% to 90% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumours. Every year 
it is estimated that approximately 37,400 people in the European Union are diagnosed with brain tumours 
and  there  are  approximately  28,900  deaths.  Worldwide,  approximately  176,000  new  cases  of  brain  and 
other CNS tumours were diagnosed in the year 2000, with an estimated mortality of 128,000. Malignant 
primary brain tumours represent about 1–2% of all newly diagnosed tumours, and account for about 2% of 
all cancer-related deaths. They are the third leading cause of death from cancer in young adults. 
Overall,  gliomas  account  for  78%  of  malignant  brain  tumours.  Malignant  glioma  comprises  of 
glioblastoma  [World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  Grade  IV],  anaplastic  astrocytoma  (WHO  Grade  III), 
mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade III) and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO Grade III). 
Diagnosis after biopsy or tumour resection is made according to the revised WHO classification. It occurs 
mostly in adults (median age at diagnosis: 64 years) and its incidence is estimated to be 3.05/100,000 in 
the United States and less than 2/100,000 in Europe. With 1- and 5-year overall survival of 29% and 3%, 
respectively, the  prognosis  of  glioblastoma  remains  particularly poor.  Although  some  progress  has  been 
made in the treatment of relapsed glioblastoma, this uncommon disease constitutes a high unmet medical 
need with very limited treatment options. 
Low  tumour  grade,  good  performance  status,  an  intact  neurological  function,  younger  age,  and 
completeness of tumour resection have been identified as more favourable prognostic factors. 
The  recommendation  for  malignant  glioma  is  surgical  debulking  provided  that  unacceptable  neurologic 
deficit  can  be  avoided,  followed  by  radiation  therapy.  Concomitant  radiotherapy  and  temozolomide, 
followed by adjuvant temozolomide for 6 cycles has been shown to significantly prolong overall survival 
compared to radiotherapy alone.  
At  relapse,  chemotherapy  is  often  proposed  as  an  option.  Regimens  include  either  monotherapy  (e.g. 
CCNU, platinum compounds, temozolomide), or polychemotherapy (PCV and other agents). If possible, a 
second resection, with or without carmustine-impregnated wafers, can be performed in patients with good 
neurologic status and performance score.

Wong  et  al.  determined  aggregate  outcomes  and  prognostic  covariates  from  eight  consecutive  Phase  II 
trials  conducted  between  1986  and  1995.  Response  assessment  was  performed  by  CT/MRI  criteria  and 
extent of corticosteroid use. 
The  protocol  for  the  pivotal  bevacizumab  study  (AVF3708g)  used  the  analysis  of  Phase  II  studies  by 
Wong  et  al.  as  an  indication  for  the  determination  of  sample  size.  Objective  response  rate  and  6-month 
PFS  in  patients  who  received  salvage  chemotherapy,  was  assumed  to  be  approximately  5%  and  15%, 
respectively.  With  regard  to  the  efficacy  of  irinotecan,  objective  response  rates  of  0-17%,  and  6-month 
PFS of 0-26% have been reported in various clinical trials of irinotecan alone. 
Endothelial proliferation has been recognized as a marker of high grade or aggressive glioma in several 
Grading classifications, and it has been demonstrated that the degree of microvascularity as assessed by 
the  endothelial  cell/capillary  density  correlates  well  with  the  biologic  aggressiveness  of  these  tumours. 
The level of VEGF expression in gliomas has been shown to correlate with blood vessel density, degree of 
malignancy,  and  prognosis.  Glioblastoma  is  a  highly  vascularised  tumour,  expressing  elevated  levels  of 
numerous  pro-angiogenic  factors,  such  as  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF),  basic  fibroblast 
growth factor, and interleukin-8. Genetic alterations in glioblastoma in favour of an angiogenic phenotype 
consist of upregulation of pro-angiogenic factors, down-regulation of angiogenesis inhibitors, and hypoxia 
induced  expression  of  pro-angiogenic  cytokines.  These  features  suggest  that  high  grade  gliomas  are  a 
suitable target for angiogenesis inhibiting therapies 
This  submission  is  based  on  one  pivotal  trial,  a  Genentech-sponsored  Phase  II  study  (AVF3708g), 
supported by data from one NCI-sponsored Phase II study (NCI 06-C-0064E) and published clinical study 
results. 
The pivotal study was carried out in accordance with GCP principles. It was conducted in accordance with 
the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration,  applicable  local  and  national  health  authority,  and  institutional 
review board requirements. 
1. 2. 1.  Clinical Pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
No  new  studies  of  clinical  pharmacology  are  presented.  In  particular,  no  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  the 
target population are presented. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has argued that no specific 
evaluation of the concentration or distribution of Bv in CNS is required due to the well-known mechanism 
of action of Bv (neutralization of VEGF within the lumen of tumour vasculature) and the inability of large 
mAb to cross the blood-brain barrier. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No new studies are presented. 
1. 2. 2.  Clinical efficacy 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
The  present  application  is  supported  by  one  pivotal  study,  an  open-label,  multicenter  Phase  II  study 
(AVF3708g).  In  this  study,  167  patients  were  randomized  to  receive  treatment  with  Bv  10 mg/kg  every 
two weeks (q2w) as single agent or in combination with irinotecan 125 mg/m2 q2w (or 340 mg/m2 q2w for 
patients  receiving  enzyme-inducing  anti-epileptic  drugs  [EIAEDs]  concomitantly).  The  results  for  this 
study represent the protocol-specified final efficacy analyses for which all randomized patients have been 
followed up for a minimum of 6 months. The clinical cut off date is 15 September 2007. 
As support for the application, data from an open-label, single arm Phase II study (NCI 06-C-0064E) are 
included. In this study, patients were enrolled to receive Bv 10 mg/kg q2w. 
The details of these two studies are presented in Table 1. The assessment will focus on the pivotal trial 
AVF3708g.

It  is  noted  that  the  pivotal  study  was  a  Phase  II  study,  and  bevacizumab  was  given  in  both  arms.  The 
randomization was for +/- irinotecan, and it was not designed to compare the efficacy of the two arms but 
merely  to  evaluate  response  rate,  progression  free  survival,  and  tolerance  of  the  two  regimens. 
Bevacizumab for patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme has not been evaluated in a randomized 
active-controlled trial.

No  dose-response  studies  for  glioblastoma  are  presented.  The  proposed  dose  of  Bv  for  patients  with 
relapsed  glioblastoma  is  10 mg/kg  q2w  or  15 mg/kg  q3w  (i.e.,  5 mg/kg  weekly  equivalent).  The 
recommendation of dosing Bv q2w or q3w is in line with its prescribing information for other indications. 
No direct comparison of the efficacy of Bv administered q2w or q3w has been performed in patients with 
relapsed  glioblastoma.  In  study  AVF3708g,  the  choice  of  bevacizumab  (Bv)  dose  (10  mg/kg  q2w)  was 
based on the reported safety and efficacy of what was at the time an ongoing Phase II trial of bevacizumab 
plus irinotecan (AVF3311s – later reported by Vredenburgh et al at ASCO 2006).  
Study AVF3708g 
This  was  a  Phase II,  open-label,  multicenter,  randomized,  non-comparative  study  consisting  of  two 
concurrent  single  arms.  Patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  Arm 1  (Bv  alone)  or  Arm 2 
(Bv + irinotecan). The randomization scheme was designed to ensure an approximate 1:1 ratio to the two 
treatment arms stratifying for each category of relapse status (first or second) and Karnofsky performance 
status (70%-80% or 90%-100%). 
Patients  with  histologically  confirmed  glioblastoma  in  first  or  second  relapse,  with  a  Karnofsky 
performance  status  of ≥ 70%  and  life  expectancy  of  > 12 weeks  were  eligible  for  participation  in  this 
study. 
Patients in the Bv arm received Bv alone at 10 mg/kg administered by intravenous (IV) infusion q2w for 
up to 104 weeks in the absence of disease progression  or discontinuation due to unmanageable toxicity. 
Patients  who  experienced  disease  progression  could  have  transitioned  to  an  optional  post-progression 
phase to receive Bv + irinotecan. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients  in  the  Bv +  irinotecan  arm  received  Bv  10 mg/kg  q2w  and  irinotecan  125 mg/m2  q2w  (or 
340 mg/m2  for  patients  taking  EIAEDs)  administered  by  IV  infusion  for  a  period  of  104 weeks  in  the 
absence of disease progression or discontinuation due to unmanageable toxicity. Patients who experienced 
unmanageable  toxicity  could  have  discontinued  the  toxicity-causing  agent  (Bv  or  irinotecan)  and 
continued with the remaining single agent for the rest of the 104-week treatment period in the absence of 
disease progression. Patients who experienced documented radiographic or clinical disease progression at 
any time were discontinued from the treatment phase and followed for survival.  
The  primary  objectives  of  the  study  were  to  evaluate  6-month  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  and 
objective response rates in both treatment arms based on IRF assessments. Secondary objectives included 
characterization of the safety of Bv alone or in combination with irinotecan in this patient population, IRF 
assessments of PFS and duration of objective response, and overall survival (OS). An exploratory analysis 
of  6-month  PFS,  PFS,  objective  response  rates  and  duration  of  objective  response,  as  determined  by 
investigators, was also performed. 
Primary Endpoints 
Six-month PFS 
Six-month  PFS,  as  determined  by  the  IRF,  was  defined  as  the  percentage  of  patients  enrolled  in  each 
treatment arm who remained alive and progression free at 24 weeks. The definition of progression free is 
given below. 
Data for patients who started to receive alternative  anti-tumor therapy prior to disease progression were 
censored  at  the  last  tumor  assessment  date  prior  to  receiving  the  alternative  therapy.  For  patients  who 
experienced the first disease progression or died more than 42 days after the last dose of study treatment, 
data were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment prior to the last dose of study treatment plus 42 
days.  
Objective Response Rate 
Objective response was defined as a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) determined on two 
consecutive  assessments ≥ 4 weeks  apart,  as  determined  by  the  IRF  using  the  modified  Macdonald 
criteria. The IRF determination of response, exclusive of corticosteroids given for chemoprophylaxis, was 
used in this analysis. 
A CR was determined only if, in addition to meeting MRI criteria for a CR, corticosteroid levels were not 
above dose levels equivalent to 20 mg/day of hydrocortisone. A PR was determined only if, in addition to 
meeting  MRI  criteria  for  a  PR,  the  corticosteroid  dose  at  the  time  of  the  MRI  was  no  greater  than  the 
maximum dose used in the first 6 weeks following initiation of therapy.  
The  objective  response  rate  was  the  percentage  of  patients  enrolled  in  each  treatment  arm  who  were 
judged to have an objective response. 
Secondary Endpoints 
PFS 
PFS  was  defined  as  time  from  randomization  to  documented  disease  progression,  as  determined  by  the 
IRF  using  the  modified  Macdonald  criteria,  clear  clinical  progression  in  the  absence  of  an  MRI 
determination  of  progression,  or  death  from  any  cause,  whichever  occurred  first.  Patients  who  had  a 
clinical  determination  of  progression  should  have  undergone  an  MRI  scan,  if  possible,  to  correlate 
radiographic  findings  with  clinical  findings.  If  a  clinical  determination  of  progression  for  a  patient  was 
confirmed by MRI, the date of the MRI scan was considered as the progression date for that patient. 
The censoring method used was the same as that used for 6-month PFS. 
Duration of Objective Response 
Duration of objective response was defined as the time from the first tumor assessment that supported the 
patient’s  objective  response  to  the  time  of  disease  progression,  as  determined  by  the  IRF,  clear  clinical 
progression in the absence of an MRI determination of progression, or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurred first.  
The censoring method used was the same as that used for 6-month PFS. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall Survival 
OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. 
Data were censored at the last date a patient was known to be alive prior to clinical cut off. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
Efficacy  based  on  the  investigator  assessments  was  considered  exploratory  based  on  the  following 
endpoints: 
Six-month PFS 
PFS 
Objective response rate 
Duration of objective response rate 
In addition, neurocognitive function was assessed as a measure of the impact of treatment on the natural 
history of malignant glioma and its potential clinical benefit. Standard psychometric instruments known to 
be  affected  by  brain  tumors  and  treatments  were  used.  These  tests  measured  three  domains  within 
neurocognitive function: 
1.  Memory:  Hopkins  Verbal  Learning  Test  (HVLT)  –  three  separate  tests  (immediate  recall 
[HVLTA], delayed recall [HVLTB], delayed recognition [HVLTC]) 
2.  Visual-motor scanning speed: Trail Making Test A and Trail Making Test B 
3.  Executive function: Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) 
The tests were conducted by trained site personnel at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter. Tests scored 
in terms of time to completion (Trail Making Tests) were discontinued at 5 minutes to reduce the time and 
burden for the patient. Each test took between 2-5 minutes to complete with a total time of approximately 
20 minutes for completion of all tests. 
Sample size 
• 
The sample size calculations were based on the following: 
In  the  Bv  arm,  a  6-month  PFS  of ≥ 28%  would  indicate  that  Bv  monotherapy has  clinically  meaningful 
activity in this population. Eighty patients treated with Bv alone would provide approximately 80% power 
(one-group χ2 test: 79%; exponential maximum likelihood estimation test: 89%) to detect an increase in 
6-month  PFS  from  15%  (in  historical  controls)  to  28%  at  the  2.5%  two-sided  significance  level.  An 
objective response rate of ≥ 18% would indicate that Bv monotherapy had clinically meaningful activity in 
this  population.  Eighty  patients  would provide  92%  power  (exact  binomial  test)  to detect  an  increase  in 
objective response rate from 5% to 18% at the 2.5% two-sided significance level. 
In  the  Bv + irinotecan  arm,  a  6-month  PFS  of ≥ 30%  would  indicate  that  Bv + irinotecan  had  clinically 
meaningful  activity  in  this  population.  Eighty  patients  treated  with  Bv + irinotecan  would  provide 
approximately  90%  power  (one-group  χ2  test: 88%;  exponential  maximum  likelihood  estimation  test: 
95%)  to  detect  a  15%  increase  in  6-month  PFS  from  15%  (in  historical  controls)  to  30%  at  the  2.5% 
two-sided significance level. An objective response rate of ≥ 25% would indicate that Bv + irinotecan had 
clinically  meaningful  activity  in  this  population.  Eighty  patients  would  provide  92% power  (exact 
binomial test) to detect a 15% increase in objective response rate from 10% to 25% at the 2.5% two-sided 
significance level. 
Randomisation 
• 
A total of 167 patients were randomized.  
Patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  Arm 1  (Bv  alone)  or  Arm 2  (Bv + irinotecan).  The 
randomization  scheme  was  designed  to  ensure  an  approximate  1:1  ratio  to  the  two  treatment  arms 
stratifying for each  category of relapse status (first or second) and Karnofsky performance  status (70%-
80% or 90%-100%).

Statistical methods 
• 
Analysis Populations 
The primary efficacy analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients 
who  were  randomized,  regardless  of  whether  they  received  any  study  treatment  or  completed  the  full 
course of treatment. Patients were analyzed according to the treatment assignment at randomization. 
Efficacy-evaluable patients were defined as randomized patients who received at least one dose of study 
treatment  (either  Bv  or  irinotecan)  and  either  had  at  least  one  post-baseline  tumor  assessment  with  a 
response  evaluation  or  failed  to  return  for  any  tumor  assessments  because  of  death  or  clinical 
determination  of  progression.  Additional  analyses  for  objective  response  were  performed  on 
efficacy-evaluable patients, as well as, on patients with measurable disease at baseline, as identified by the 
IRF, and on patients with central pathology-confirmed glioblastoma at baseline. 
Statistical Analyses of Efficacy Endpoints 
Each treatment arm was analyzed separately for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Because of 
the existence of two primary endpoints for each treatment arm, the primary efficacy analyses of 6-month 
PFS and objective response rate were performed at the two-sided 0.025 level of significance.  
Six-month PFS  
The 6-month PFS with salvage chemotherapy was assumed to be approximately 15% based on historical 
data.  Therefore,  for  the  Bv  arm,  the  following  hypothesis  was  tested  at  the  α = 0.025  (two-sided) 
significance level: 
H0: 6-month PFS =15% versus H1: 6-month PFS ≠15%  
The 6-month PFS with irinotecan alone was also assumed to be 15% based on historical data. Therefore, 
for the Bv + irinotecan arm, the following hypothesis was tested at the α = 0.025 (two-sided) significance 
level: 
H0: 6-month PFS = 15% versus H1: 6-month PFS ≠ 15% 
Kaplan−Meier  methods  were  used  to  estimate  6-month  PFS,  along  with  the  standard  error  and  the 
corresponding 97.5% confidence intervals (CIs) using Greenwood’s formula. The normal approximation 
method was used to evaluate whether each treatment had a statistically significant effect, as measured by 
6-month PFS.  
If  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  of  6-month  PFS  in  the  Bv  arm  produced  a  two-sided  p-value  that  was 
statistically  significant  at  the  α = 0.025  significance  level  with  a  6-month  PFS  > 15%,  then  it  would  be 
concluded that Bv monotherapy resulted in a statistically significant increase in 6-month PFS compared 
with salvage chemotherapy in this population.  
If the primary efficacy analysis of 6-month PFS in the Bv + irinotecan arm produced a two-sided p-value 
that was statistically significant at the α = 0.025 significance level with a 6-month PFS > 15%, it would be 
concluded  that  combination  therapy  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  6-month  PFS 
compared with irinotecan alone in this population. 
Objective Response Rate  
The objective response rate to salvage chemotherapy was assumed to be 5% based on historical data. 
Therefore, for the Bv arm, the following hypothesis was tested at the α = 0.025 (two-sided) significance 
level: 
 H0: objective response rate = 5% versus H1: objective response rate ≠5% 
The objective response rate to irinotecan alone was assumed to be 10% based on historical data. Therefore 
for the Bv + irinotecan arm, the following hypothesis was tested at the α = 0.025 (two-sided) significance 
level: 
H0: objective response rate = 10% versus H1: objective response rate ≠ 10% 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  exact  binomial  test  was  used  to  evaluate  whether  the  treatment  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant 
increase  in  objective  response  rate.  Exact  97.5%  CIs  were  estimated  using  the  Blyth−Still−Casella 
method. 
If the primary efficacy analysis of objective response rate in the Bv arm produced a two-sided p-value that 
was  statistically  significant  at  the  α = 0.025  significance  level  with  an  objective  response  rate  > 5%,  it 
would  be  concluded  that  Bv  monotherapy  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  objective 
response rate compared with salvage chemotherapy in this population.  
If the primary efficacy analysis of objective response rate in the Bv + irinotecan arm produced a two-sided 
p-value that was statistically significant at the α = 0.025 significance level with an objective response rate 
> 10%,  it  would  be  concluded  that  combination  therapy  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  increase  in 
objective response rate compared with irinotecan alone in this population. 
Secondary Endpoints 
Estimates for the secondary endpoints of PFS, duration of objective response and OS for each treatment 
arm  were  based  on  the  Kaplan−Meier  method.  The 95%  CIs  for  median  PFS  were  computed  using  the 
Brookmeyer and Crowley method. The 95% CIs for median duration of objective response and median OS 
were computed using Greenwood’s formula.  
Sensitivity Analyses 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed: 
Six-month PFS and PFS (IRF and investigator assessments) 
Only data for patients who did not have an event at the time of the clinical cut off were censored (ie, all 
events were included in the analysis); data for patients without an event were censored at the date of their 
last tumor assessment prior to data cut off. 
Objective response rate (IRF assessment) 
Data for all administered corticosteroids were included.  
Only data for corticosteroids not given for chemoprophylaxis were included. For this analysis, baseline 
corticosteroid use was defined as the average corticosteroid dose within 4 days of the first study treatment 
administration. 
Exploratory Analyses 
As an exploratory analysis, the relative efficacy between the Bv and Bv + irinotecan arms was assessed for 
the endpoints objective response rate, PFS, duration of objective response and OS.  
Objective  response  rates  between  the  two  arms  were  compared  using  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test, 
stratified for relapse status (first or second) and Karnofsky performance status (70%-80% vs 90%-100%). 
Confidence intervals for the difference in response rates were determined using the normal approximation 
of the binomial distribution. 
For  the  time-to-event  endpoints  PFS,  duration  of  objective  response  and  OS,  a  two-sided  stratified  log-
rank test was used to compare the arms, using the following stratification factors: relapse status (first or 
second) and Karnofsky performance status (70%-80% vs 90%-100%). Hazard ratios were estimated using 
a stratified Cox-regression model. Results from an unstratified analysis are also provided. 
For the analysis of neurocognitive function, data from each test were analyzed separately. All test scores 
were  normalized  using  the  patient’s  age.  The  COWA  tests  scores  were  adjusted  by  the  patient’s 
educational level in addition to age. For each test, neurocognitive progression was defined as a worsening 
in normative test score from baseline by 3 standard deviations (SDs) in the test’s normative distribution. 
Data  were  censored  at  the  earliest  occurrence  of  discontinuation  from  the  study,  initiation  of  additional 
brain-related treatment or death. The distribution of time to neurocognitive progression for each test was 
estimated  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method.  Both  univariate  and  multiple-covariate  proportional  hazards 
models  were  used  to  assess  the  effect  of  prognostic  factors  on  time  to  neurocognitive  progression.  The 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
models  included,  but  were  not  limited  to,  the  variables  relapse  status  (first  or  second)  and  baseline 
Karnofsky performance status (70%-80% or 90%-100%). 
Results  
• 
Participant flow  
In  both  studies  bevacizumab  (10  mg/kg/q2w  administration)  was  to  be  continued  until  progression  or 
unacceptable  toxicity,  but  was  limited  to  a  maximum  of  104  weeks  in  study  AVF3708g.  No  dose 
reductions for bevacizumab were allowed in either study, only interruption or withdrawal. Agent-specific 
criteria for the discontinuation of bevacizumab were specified in each protocol (as well as for irinotecan in 
study  AVF3708g).  In  study  AVF3708g,  patients  who  discontinued  trial  treatment  prior  to  progression 
were  followed  for  survival,  but  not  for  progression.  Subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  after  trial  treatment 
discontinuation was not specified in any protocol, but was not to be initiated until after progression. For 
patients randomised to the bevacizumab single-agent arm of study AVF3708g, post-progression treatment 
of irinotecan in combination with bevacizumab was a protocol specified option after disease progression. 
Information  regarding  any  subsequent  anticancer  treatment  used  before  or  after  progression  was  not 
collected. 
Six-month PFS is defined as the number of patients who are alive and progression-free at the scheduled 24 
week assessment. The censoring used for the main analyses of PFS in the AVF3708g CSR is described 
below: 
•  Data  for  patients  without  a  PFS  event  at  the  time  of  the  clinical  cut–off  for  the  analysis  were 
censored on the date of their last tumour assessment prior to the cut-off. 
•  Data  for  patients  who  started  to  receive  alternative  anti-tumour  therapy  prior  to  disease 
progression  were  censored  at  the  last  tumour  assessment  date  prior  to  receiving  the  alternative 
therapy. 
•  Data for patients who experienced the first disease progression or died more than 42 days after the 
last dose of study treatment, data were censored at the date of the last tumour assessment prior to 
the last dose of study treatment plus 42 days. 
Study AVF3708g also included measures of performance status and neurological function based in part on 
validated neurocognitive tests as well as evidence of corticosteroid-sparing. 
In study AVF3708g, clinical progression (patient considered to have clearly worsened neurologically) and 
corticosteroid use were added into the MRI response evaluation criteria for the investigator assessment of 
response (MacDonald criteria). Subjectivity was reduced by the use of a blinded independent radiographic 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
review  (IRF)  of  MRI  for  the  determination  of  response  and  progression  in  study  AVF3708g,  and  of 
response in study NCI 06-C-0064E. 
Initially presented results of the pivotal study (AVF3708g), represent the protocol-specified final analysis 
of the study (minimum of 6 months follow-up of each patient), with a clinical cut-off of September 15, 
2007.  The  PFS  analyses  are  mature  with  68-75%  of  patients  having  had  an  event  according  to  the 
investigator at the time of the clinical cut-off. Approximately 50% of patients had died at the time of the 
clinical  cut-off.  The  study  was  initiated  in  June  30,  2006  meaning  that  follow-up  ranged  between  a 
minimum 6 months to a maximum of 14.5 months.  
Study Populations 
The population of patients with glioblastoma after relapse enrolled into study AVF3708g and NCI 06-C-
0064E  was  representative  of  the  adult  population  expected  to  receive  bevacizumab  should  marketing  in 
this  indication  be  approved.  However,  primary  and  secondary  glioblastoma  are  two  distinct  disease 
entities  which  develop  through  different  genetic  pathways.  As  only  seven  patients  with  secondary 
glioblastoma  have  been  included  in  the  study  it  is  not  possible  to  conclude  on  the  efficacy  in  these 
patients.  At  present,  it  is  considered  acceptable  that  limited  data  is  available  in  this  patient  group. 
However, in future studies patients should be stratified according to genetic factors. 
The inclusion of an independent central pathology review of baseline histology confirmed the diagnosis of 
glioblastoma for 165/167 patients in study AVF3708g. The majority of patients were in first relapse (81%), 
and all but 14 patients had at least a partial resection upon initial diagnosis. All patients had received prior 
radiotherapy and at least one systemic therapy including temozolomide. The MAH has clarified that 89% 
of the enrolled patients received temozolomide concomitant with RT, and all but 3% of patients completed 
at least 6 cycles of temozolomide or stopped prior to the 6th cycle due to disease progression.  
At baseline, 55% of patients in the Bv arm and 62% in the Bv + irinotecan arm had the lowest Karnofsky 
Performance Status allowed of 70-80. The median age was 54-57 years in each study treatment arm, with 
an overall age range of 23-79 years. The majority of patients were male (69%), and 90% were white.

Patient  disposition  was  reasonably  consistent  between  treatment  arms  and  studies.  The  proportion  of 
patients that withdrew from trial treatment prior to PD or death was lower in the Bv arm (7%) of study 
AVF3708g,  compared  to  either  the  Bv+irinotecan  arm  (20%)  of  study  AVF3708g,  or  study  NCI  06-C-

Comparison of Efficacy across Studies 
In  the  pivotal  study  (AVF3708g),  the  protocol-defined  main  analysis  of  efficacy  (using  the  IRF 
assessment)  established  that  bevacizumab  used  as  single-agent  or  in  combination  with  irinotecan  for 
treatment of patients with glioblastoma after relapse resulted in: 
•  Kaplan-Meier estimated 6-month PFS of 42.6% (95% CI 29.6-55.5%) in the Bv arm and 50.3% 
(95%  CI  36.8-63.9%)  in  the  Bv + irinotecan  arm,  representing  a statistically  significant  increase 
(p < 0.0001) compared with protocol-defined historical controls for both treatment arms (6-month 
PFS assumed to be 15%).  
•  Objective response rates of 28.2% (95% CI 18.5-40.3%) in the Bv arm and 37.8% (95% CI 26.5-
50.8%) in the Bv + irinotecan arm, representing a statistically significant increase (p < 0.0001) in 
objective  response  rates  compared  with  protocol-defined  historical  controls  for  both  treatment 
arms (assumed to be 5% for salvage chemotherapy, and 10 % for irinotecan alone). 
•  Durable responses in both treatment arms, Kaplan-Meier estimated median duration of response 
of 5.6 months (95% CI 3.0- 5.8) in the Bv arm and 4.3 months (95% CI 4.2- no estimate) in the 
Bv + irinotecan arm. 
•  Kaplan-Meier  estimated  median  PFS  of  4.2 months  (95%  CI  2.9-5.8)  in  the  Bv  arm  and 
5.6 months  (95%  CI  4.4-6.2)  in  the  Bv + irinotecan  arm,  with  approximately  73%  and  61%  of 
patients in each arm having had a PFS event by the time of the analysis. 
•  Kaplan-Meier estimated median overall survival of 9.3 months (95% CI 8.2- no estimate) in the 
Bv arm and 8.8 months (95% CI 7.8- no estimate) in the Bv + irinotecan arm, with approximately 
46% and 54% of patients in each arm having died at the time of the analysis. 
At  the  time  of  the  protocol-specified  final  analysis,  the  duration  of  follow-up  did  not  allow  an  accurate 
estimation of the upper confidence interval for duration of response and overall survival. 
Compared to the IRF assessment, the objective response rate and duration of response was considerably 
higher according to the investigator assessment; 41% (7.2 months) in the Bv arm and 51% (8.3 months) in 
the Bv+irinotecan arm. According to the investigators’ assessment, using the sensitivity analysis of PFS 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(with censoring only for patients who did not have an event), approximately 75% and 68% of patients in 
each arm had a PFS event at the time of the analysis, and the Kaplan-Meier estimated median PFS was 4.2 
months and 5.8 months. The MAH has clarified that the sensitivity analysis can be considered to represent 
an ITT analysis.  
In the IRF assessment, using the less censored sensitivity analysis of PFS, approximately 77% of patients 
in each arm had a PFS event at the time of the analysis, and the Kaplan-Meier estimated median PFS was 
4.2 months and 5.5 months.  
In  addition  to  these  tumour  responses  and  progression  results,  overall  survival  was  also  longer  than 
evident in historical controls. In the MAH’s answer to the CHMP RSI, an updated OS analysis of study 
AVF3708g did not show notable differences to the initial analysis. 
The statistical tests and calculations are standard. The major problem is the lack of an internal control and 
comparisons based on historical data.  
The historical data on which the comparisons are based stem mainly from the data from Wong et al (JCO 
1999).  These  data  were  collected  from  8  Phase  II  trials  conducted  at  the  MD  Anderson  Cancer  Center 
during the period 1986 to 1995. As can be gathered from the publication, these historical patients could 
have  a  lower  Karnofsky  score  than  the  patients  in  the  AVF3708g  trial;  they  had  on  the  whole  received 
more treatment before protocol entry, and had had less complete tumour removal initially. In the absence 
of  a  controlled,  randomized  trial,  the  MAH  has  been  asked  to  perform  a  far  more  elaborate  inter-trial 
comparison of the efficacy and safety of Bv to other available therapies in recurrent GBM and to include a 
critical  discussion  of  potential  biases  and  emphasis  on  the  results  of  more  recent  trials  of  alternative 
therapies.  
Consequently, the MAH has performed a very thorough and critical inter-trial comparison of the efficacy 
and safety of bevacizumab compared to: 
- the predefined historic controls (various agents (Wong et al., Ballman et al., Lamborn et al.)) 
- in addition Prados – the results from the NABTC clinical trials database were included for comparison 
- contemporary phase III studies (hydroxyurea, hydroxyurea + imatinib, enzastaurin, lomustine)  
-  data  from  other,  more  recent  phase  II  trials  (dose-intense  temozolomide  regimens,  temozolomide  re-
challenge, continuous low-dose temozolomide, fotemustine)

Ancillary analyses, Other endpoints 
No formal Quality of Life evaluation was implemented in study AVF3708g. However, information on the 
following parameters was collected in the study: Neurocognitive function, steroid dose and dependence, 
KPS. 
In  order  to  address  the  problem  of  lack  of  a  control  group,  the  MAH  has  performed  several  post-hoc 
analyses  that  evaluate  the  effect  of  Bv  by  comparing  the  on-treatment  data  for  each  of  the  parameters 
above with baseline data, assessing each patient as his/her internal control.  
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When applying the Reliable Change Index (RCI) criteria to assess the change form baseline, the majority 
of responding patients experienced a stable/improved neurocognitive function while on Bv treatment. For 
the purpose of assessing changes over time, the neurocognitive test scores were converted to standardized 
scores by use of published normative data. Overall, median neurocognitive test scores of patients with an 
IRF-determined  OR  remained  stable  or  improved  from  baseline  to  Week  24  both  in  the  Bv  and 
Bv+irinotecan arms.  
Likewise, a considerable number of patients on steroids were able to reduce their steroid dose whilst on 
Bv  treatment:  Approximately  50%  of  patients  received  steroids  at  baseline  and  around  half  of  these 
patients had a steroid reduction of at least 50% for a minimum of 4 weeks. Particularly in patients who 
were progression-free at 6 months, the magnitude and duration of steroid reductions were noteworthy. 
Finally,  85%  of  Bv-treated  patients  and  87%  of  Bv+irinotecan  treated  patients  maintained  a  stable  or 
improved  KPS  for  approximately  70%  of  their  progression-free  period  on  average.  In  study  AVF3708g, 
within  24  weeks  of  starting  trial  treatment,  the  majority  of  patients  that  were  progression-free  had 
Karnofsky Performance Scores that generally remained stable, in the range of 70-100. 
During the study, most patients in both treatment arms had a decrease of corticosteroid dose relative to 
their dose at baseline: 
Study AVF3708g: Percent Change of the Lowest Corticosteroid Dose from Baseline  
(Randomized Patients Taking Corticosteroid at Baseline) 
BV = bevacizumab; CPT-11 = irinotecan. 
Note:    The  lowest  corticosteroid  dose  is  defined  as  the  minimum  of  the  average  corticosteroid  dose  of 
every 4 weeks after the first treatment until planned treatment discontinuation.  The baseline corticosteroid 
dose is defined as the average corticosteroid dose within 4 days before the first study treatment. 
For patients in the BV arm who received optional post-progression treatment of irinotecan, corticosteroid 
use  during  the  optional  post-progression  phase  is  not  included  in  the  graph.    All  corticosteroids  were 
converted to a dexamethasone-equivalent dose. 
Each needle represents 1 patient. 
A  total  of  6  neurocognitive  function  tests  were  administered  to  patients:  HVLT  A  (immediate  recall), 
HVLT B (delayed recall), HVLT C (delayed recognition), Trail Making Test A, Trail Making Test B and 
the COWA.  
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For each test, median scores at baseline, week 12 and week 24, as well as, median change from baseline 
scores are shown in the two tables below. 
In  the  Bevacizumab  arm,  median  scores  improved  with  time  for  the  visual  motor  scanning  speed  tests 
(Trail Making Tests A and B), the COWA test and the immediate recall memory test (HVLT A). Median 
scores  did  not  worsen  with  time  for  the  delayed  recall  and  delayed  recognition  memory  tests  (HVLT  B 
and HVLT C).  
In  the  Bevacizumab + irinotecan  arm,  median  scores  improved  with  time  for  the  visual  motor  scanning 
speed tests (Trail Making Tests A and B) and the COWA test. Median scores did not worsen with time for 
the three memory tests (HVLT A, B and C). However, as the number of patients in both treatment arms 
completing the tests declines considerably with time, these results should be interpreted with caution.

BL: baseline; Bv: bevacizumab; COWA: Controlled Oral Word Association. 
Raw test scores were standardized based on normative distribution adjusted by age (and education level for the COWA test). 
1 the normative distribution for this test has a median of 38, Q1=32, Q4=44. 
Due  to  the  low  number  of  neurocognitive  progression  events  per  test,  median  time  to  neurocognitive 
progression  could  not  be  estimated  for  any  of  the  tests  administered.  Therefore,  no  conclusions  can  be 
made regarding the impact of study treatment on neurocognitive progression. 
Efficacy in Patient Subgroups 
In  study  AVF3708g,  analyses  of  objective  response  and  6-month  PFS  were  performed  in  the  following 
subgroups of patients: 
•  Age (< 65, ≥ 65 years) 
•  Gender (male, female) 
•  Race (White, non-White) 
•  Karnofsky performance status (70%-80%, 90%-100%) 
•  Relapse status (first relapse, second relapse) 
•  Baseline EIAED use (yes, no) 
•  Baseline corticosteroid use (yes, no) 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Prior diagnosis of glioma (glioblastoma, other) 
•  Extent of initial surgery (complete resection, partial resection, biopsy only) 
There  were  no  significant  differences  in  the  outcome  in  any  of  the  subgroups  analysed.  The  number  of 
patients is, however, relatively small, and some of the analyses are rather uncertain. 
Correlative Assessment of Biomarkers 
No  formal  collection  and  assessment  of  potential  biomarkers  are  described  in  the  protocol  of  study 
AVF3708g. During the Bevacizumab development program, the MAH has investigated a large number of 
potential  biomarkers  across  indications.  So  far  no  correlation  between  levels  of  these  biomarkers  and 
clinical  outcome  in  Bv-treated  patients  has  been  identified.  Specifically,  no  association  between  Bv 
efficacy  and  tumour  VEGF  expression  or  plasma  VEGF  levels  has  been  observed.  In  study  AVF3311s 
tumour specimens from the time of diagnosis were available from 45 (27 glioblastoma) of the 60 recruited 
patients.  Radiographic  response  and  survival  outcome  were  explored  for  correlation  with VEGF,  VEGF 
receptor-2,  CD31,  hypoxia-inducible  carbonic  anhydrase  9  (CA9),  and  hypoxia-inducible  factor-2α 
assessed semi-quantitatively by immunohistochemistry ( data not shown).  
Chen  et  al.  showed  that  a  reduction  in  metabolic  activity,  as  measured  by  18F-fluorothymidine  PET 
scanning,  correlated  with  response  and  survival  in  patients  with  Grade  III  and  IV  glioma  treated  with 
bevacizumab  plus  irinotecan.  Not  surprisingly,  FDG-PET  seems  promising  for  evaluation  of  prognosis 
after treatment. Tumour hypoxia may well contribute to the poor prognosis of glioblastoma.  
The MAH has included a comprehensive list of biomarkers that will be studied in the currently enrolling, 
large,  randomized,  placebo-controlled  phase  III  trial  (BO21990  trial)  in  patients  with  newly  diagnosed 
glioblastoma.   
Efficacy reported from independent phase II studies 
At the time that study AVF3708g was conducted, the NCI sponsored an independent, single-site, phase II 
study to evaluate Bv monotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed glioblastoma who had failed 
previous treatment for glioblastoma (study NCI 06-C-0064E).  
Inclusion criteria for Study NCI 06-C-0064E 
Patients must have progressed after radiation therapy 
Patients  must  have  recovered  from  the  toxic  effects  of  prior  therapy:  2  weeks  from  any  investigational 
agent,  4  weeks  from  prior  cytotoxic  therapy,  two  weeks  from  vincristine,  6  weeks  from  nitrosoureas,  3 
weeks from procarbazine administration, and 1 week for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, 
thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count). All patients enrolled in the study had 
received prior surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy, including temozolomide. 
Efficacy Results 
The results were an ORR of 35%, median response duration of 3.7 months, PFS6 of 29%, and median OS 
of  7.8  months  (Kreisl  2009),  providing  further  support  for  the  clinically  meaningful  efficacy  results  of 
study AVF3708g). 
The NCI 06-C-0064E study that was presented in the variation application (efficacy data summarised in 
Table 3 of the Clinical Overview) has since been published by Kreisl et al. In the publication of the NCI 
06-C-0064  study,  the  authors  state  that  a  significant  number  of  patients  derived  clinical  benefit  from 
bevacizumab treatment, manifested as decreased cerebral edema (24 (50%) patients), improved neurologic 
symptoms  (25  patients  (52%)  had  improved  neurologic  symptoms,  including  a  number  who  were  not 
progression-free  at  6  months),  and  decreased  requirement  for  corticosteroids  (15  (58%)  of  26  patients 
receiving  corticosteroids  at  the  start  of  treatment  were  able  to  decrease  their  requirement  for 
corticosteroids  by  an  average  dose  reduction  of  59%).  However,  further  data  from  this  study  are  not 
available in the public domain, or to Roche.

The situation for study NCI 06-C-0064E was less clear in the protocol. However, the IRF report of this 
study stated that all patients enrolled in the study had received prior surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic 
therapy, including temozolomide. 
Study NCI 06-C-0064E was an NCI-sponsored trial for which the MAH does not have direct access to the 
data.  The  NCI  made  the  tumor  assessment  scans  from  the  study  available  to  Genentech,  for  an 
independent review of tumor assessments. A report of the independent review facility’s (IRF) assessment 
of these scans was prepared by Genentech, and this report formed part of the variation application. 
Additional  results  from  the  NCI  06-C-0064E  study  have  been  published  since  the  MAA  submission.  A 
summary  of  the  efficacy  results  from  this  publication  and  the  IRF  report  (presented  in  the  variation 
application) are presented in Table 3. The results from the publication are based on 48 patients enrolled 
into  the  study,  rather  than  56  patients  as  in  the  IRF  report.  The  reason  for  this  difference  is  that  the 
manuscript was prepared by the authors’ based on the first 48 glioblastoma patients enrolled into the trial 
(enrollment from January 2006 to July 2007), representing all patients that had been fully evaluated by the 
authors’ at the time of the data cut-off used for the investigator’s analysis. According to the Investigator’s 
assessment,  17  of  the  48  patients  (35%)  achieved  radiographic  response  based  on  Macdonald  criteria. 
Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 6.0 months). The 6-month PFS 
was 29% (95% CI, 18% to 48%). The 6-month overall survival was 57% (95% CI, 44% to 75%). Median 
overall survival was 7.1 months (95% CI, 4.8 to 12.4 months).

In  addition,  the  publication  reported  that  evidence  for  the  clinical  benefit  of  bevacizumab  was  provided 
by: 
24 patients (50%) having decreased cerebral edema, 
15 (58%) of 26 patients receiving corticosteroids at the start of treatment being able to decrease their 
requirement for corticosteroids by an average dose reduction of 59%, 
25 patients (52%) having improved neurologic symptoms, including a number who were not progression-
free at 6 months. 
More  recently,  the  results  of  a  phase  II  study  AVF3311s  undertaken  in  a  cooperative  group  setting  to 
determine the efficacy and safety of Bv with irinotecan in relapsed glioblastoma demonstrated a PFS6 rate 
of 37%, with 21 of 57 patients progression-free at 6 months (Gilbert et al. 2009). 
In  conclusion,  the  results  of  studies  AVF3708g,  as  well  as  study  AVF3311s  and  the  other  investigator 
reported  studies  with  bevacizumab  in  glioblastoma  at  relapse  (presented  in  the  Clinical  Overview)  all 
support  the  activity  of  bevacizumab  at  this  dose  in  this  indication.  It  is  not  possible  to  decide  on  the 
optimal schedule from the available data. The two-week and three-week schedules of bevacizumab have 
been  accepted  as  equivalent.  However,  two-  and  three  week  schedules  of  irinotecan  are  probably  not 
equivalent. The optimal schedule of irinotecan in this disease is still to be established.

The  final  published  results  of  study  NCI-06-C-0064E  show  somewhat  shorter  PFS  and  OS  than  in  the 
pivotal  study;  median  PFS  3.7  months  and  median  OS  7.1  months  vs  median  PFS  4.2/5.6  months 
(BV/BV+iriniotecan) and median OS 9.3/8.9 months in the pivotal study. In addition the rate of PFS6 was 
smaller (29 %), than in the pivotal study (44%/58% (BV/BV+irinotecan)).  
1. 2. 3.  Clinical Safety 
The safety of bevacizumab with or without irinotecan in patients with glioblastoma after relapse is derived 
from  the  pivotal  Phase  II,  randomised,  open-label  trial  (AVF3708g).  In  addition,  further  information  on 
safety comes from NCI 06-C-0064E. 
The methodology of safety assessments can be considered as standard and appropriate to evaluate safety 
in this patient population. Of note, specific events frequently observed in glioblastoma after relapse were 
collected as events of special interest, including seizure, haemorrhage and thromobembolism. 
Patient exposure 
In  study  AVF3708g,  84  patients  in  the  Bevacizumab  arm  and  79  in  the  Bevacizumab+irinotecan  arm 
received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  during  the  planned  treatment  period.  The  number  of 
Bevacizumab doses received (median 12 vs. 9) and the duration of Bevacizumab exposure (median 5.1 vs. 
3.7 months) was increased in the Bevacizumab+irinotecan arm compared to the Bevacizumab alone arm. 
In the NCI-06-C-0064E study, 55 patients received at least one dose of Bevacizumab, and exposure was 
less than in study AVF3708g (median number of Bevacizumab doses 7, median duration of treatment of 
2.8 months). In both studies, bevacizumab was administered at 10 mg/kg/q2w. 
In the Bevacizumab+irinotecan arm of study AVF3708g, there was evidence that irinotecan was stopped 
in some patients a little earlier than bevacizumab (median number of doses of irinotecan 11, duration 4.9 
months).  At  the  time  of  the  clinical  cut-off  for  the  analysis  of  AVF3708g,  22  patients  (26%)  in  the 
Bevacizumab  arm  and  20  patients  (24%)  in  the  Bevacizumab+irinotecan  arm  were  still  continuing  with 
bevacizumab treatment prior to progression. A total of 6 patients (7%) in the Bevacizumab arm, and 16 
patients (20%) in the Bevacizumab+irinotecan arm had stopped bevacizumab for reasons other than PD or 
death, indicating that most patients were treated until progression or were still on trial treatment prior to 
progression. 
Additionally,  Bevacizumab+irinotecan  was  administered  in  the  optional  post-progression  phase  of  study 
AVF3708g that was only open to patients initially randomised to the Bevacizumab alone arm. In total, 44 
patients were enrolled in this phase of the study, with only 2 patients still being on treatment at the time of 
the clinical cut-off for the analysis. 
The safety information in the target population for the present application is limited to 218 patients. This 
information  is  particularly  relevant  with  regard  to  CNS  complications  and  toxicity.  However,  there  is  a 
vast  experience  with  Bevacizumab  in  other  malignancies,  including  detailed  information  on  adverse 
events. 
Adverse events 
In patients with glioblastoma treated with Bv or Bv+irinotecan after relapse: 
•  There were no unexpected toxicities with the use of bevacizumab in patients with this indication, the 
safety profile of bevacizumab being similar to that previously established in other cancer indications 
(mCRC,  NSCLC,  mBC,  mRCC).  In  particular,  there  was  no  indication  that  Bv  increased  the 
following principal safety risks in this patient population: 
clinically relevant intra-tumoral haemorrhage 
thromboembolic events 
seizures 
– 
– 
– 
•  Deaths in both studies were mainly due to progressive disease. In total, 5.6% (7 out of 124 patients 
that  died  after  receiving  trial  treatment)  of  the  deaths  were  not  directly  attributed  to  the  underlying 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease  by  the  investigator.  AEs  that  led  to  death  were  recorded  as  neutropenia  infection  (1), 
convulsion  (1),  pulmonary  embolism  (3,  one  associated  with  sudden  death  and  one  with 
cerebrovascular ischemia). Three of these patients had AEs that led to death that were considered to 
be possibly related to trial treatment by the investigator (neutropenia infection, convulsion, and one 
patient  with  both  cerebrovascular  ischemia  and  pulmonary  embolism).  The  thromboembolic  events 
are known risks in this patient population. The neutropenia infection and the convulsion events were 
also  assessed  by 
to  concomitant  steroid  use  and 
immunosuppression, as well as underlying disease. 
investigator  as  possibly  related 
the 
•  More  patients  in  the  Bevcizumab+irinotecan  arm  (65.8%)  than  the  Bevacizumab  arm  (46.4%)  of 
study  AVF3708g,  experienced  at  least  one  Grade  ≥ 3  AE.  The  difference  was  mainly  due  to  the 
incidence  of  lymphopenia,  neutropenia  and  leukopenia,  fatigue,  convulsion  and  AEs  in  the 
Gastrointestinal System Order Class. In part, this may reflect the longer safety follow-up of patients 
in this arm (6.1 vs. 4.3 months), but also the addition of the known toxicity profile of irinotecan. 
•  Within study AVF3708g, the use of Bevacizumab with irinotecan appeared to increase the number of 
patients  that  prematurely  withdrew  from  Bevacizumab  due  to  AEs  (4.8%  vs.  17.7%).  However, 
despite  this,  exposure  to  Bevacizumab  was  longer  in  the  combination  arm  (median  3.7  vs.  5.1 
months). The incidence rate of premature withdrawal from Bevacizumab single-agent in study NCI-
06-C-0064E (16%) was similar to that from the Bevacizumab+irinotecan arm of study AVF3708g. 
In general, no new toxicities appeared in the pivotal and supportive studies. 
Due  to  the  lack  of  an  internal  control  in  the  pivotal  study  AVF3708g,  the  MAH  has  not  been  able  to 
clarify  whether  the  described  toxicity of  Bv  is  comparable  or  worse  than  what  would  be  expected  from 
other therapies. 
On the other hand the MAH has reviewed the safety data of study AVF3780 and the safety information for 
Bv across indications instead. In addition, the safety profile of Bv has been compared with supportive data 
from a second Phase II single-arm study (NCI 06-C.0064E) and published literature in approximately 860 
BV-treated  patients  with  relapsed  GBM.  Focus  has  also  been  put  on  events  of  special  interest  both  in 
relation to the diagnosis and to the treatment with Bv. 
No  new  safety  signals  have  been  identified.  No  additional  risk  has  been  identified  in  patients  with 
recurrent  GBM.  Overall,  the  described  safety  profile  of  Bv  in  the  sought  indication  seems  to  be  1) 
expectable  from  our  previous  experience  with  Bv,  and  last  but  not  least  2)  acceptable  considering  the 
gloomy  prognosis,  many  co-morbidities  and  sequelae  from  other  treatment  modalities  that  are 
characteristic of patients with recurrent GBM.  
Grade 3-5 Adverse Events 
In study AVF3708g, Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported in 39 patients (46.4%) in the Bevacizumab arm and in 
52 patients (65.8%) in the Bevacizumab + irinotecan arm during the planned treatment period. Grade ≥ 3 
AEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients in either treatment arm are summarized in the table below. The most 
common  of  these  AEs  were  hypertension  (8.3%)  and  convulsion  (6.0%)  in  the  Bevacizumab  arm;  and 
convulsion (13.9%), neutropenia (8.9%) and fatigue (8.9%) in the Bevacizumab + irinotecan arm.

Bevacizumab + irinotecan arm died during the study or during follow-up, see table below. The majority of 
these deaths were considered by the investigator to be due to progressive disease. 
Of the 5 deaths that were not due to progressive disease, 3 were attributed to AEs and occurred within 90 
days of last Bevacizumab dose. 
Neutropenia infection (patient 20153 in the Bevacizumab arm) assessed by the investigator as related to 
Bevacizumab  treatment  but  could  also  be  attributed  to  concomitant  steroid  administration  and 
immunosuppression. 
Pulmonary  embolism  (patient  20404  in  the  Bevacizumab  arm)  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as 
unrelated to Bevacizumab treatment. 
Convulsion  (patient  20251  in  the  Bevacizumab + irinotecan  arm)  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as 
related  to  Bevacizumab  and  irinotecan  treatment  with  the  underlying  disease  as  a  possible  etiological 
factor.  
In the NCI 06-C-0064E study, 45/55 patients (81.8%) were known to have died as of the clinical cut off 
date  of  3  June  2008.  The  majority  of  these  deaths  (43/45)  were  due  to  progressive  disease.  Of  the  two 
remaining deaths, one was attributed to clinical deterioration due to the underlying disease and the other to 
toxicity from study treatment. 
Three patients are listed as having a Grade 5 AE of ‘death’ (NCI-CTCAE pre-selected term). The cause of 
death for 2 of these patients, however, is given as progressive disease. The remaining death was attributed 
to toxicity from study treatment: 
•  Patient 23: the cause of death was progressive disease (unrelated to study drug). 
•  Patient  44:  the  cause  of  death  was  progressive  disease;  the  patient  developed  a  Grade  4  pulmonary 
embolism and discontinued study drug 18 days before death. 
•  Patient  59:  death  was  a  result  of  a  Grade  4  cerebrovascular  ischemia  and  a  Grade  4  pulmonary 
embolism and was assessed by the investigator as due to toxicity related to the study drug. 
Serious Adverse Events 
In  study  AVF3708g,  22  patients  (26.2%)  in  the  Bevacizumab  arm  and  34  patients  (43.0%)  in  the 
Bevacizumab + irinotecan  arm  experienced  a  SAE  during  the  planned  treatment  period.  SAEs  reported 
in ≥ 2%  of  patients  during  the  planned  treatment  period  are  summarized  in  the  table  below.  The  most 
common SAE reported was convulsion (6.0% in the Bevacizumab arm and 11.4% in the Bevacizumab + 
irinotecan arm).

In conclusion, the number of serious adverse events is quite high. They are experienced by more than half 
the patients. 
The number of deaths is high as expected in this deadly disease. However, there are a number of deaths 
attributable to the treatment. It is impossible to estimate the real effect of Bevacizumab on the incidence of 
deaths because of the lack of a comparator arm.  
Laboratory findings 
Analysis  of  post-baseline  laboratory  abnormalities  by  NCI-CTCAE  grade  in  study  AVF3708g  did  not 
reveal any new safety signals associated with Bevacizumab treatment). 
Safety in special populations 
In study AVF3708g, the incidence of AEs during the planned treatment period was generally consistent 
across age (< 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years), race (White vs. non-White) and gender (male vs. female patients). 
In  the  Bevacizumab  arm,  differences ≥ 10%  in  the  incidence  of  Grade ≥ 3  AEs  across  subgroups  were 
seen for:  
Hypertension with a higher incidence in patients ≥ 65 years (18.2% vs. 6.8%). 
In  the  Bevacizumab + irinotecan  arm,  differences ≥ 10%  in  the  incidence  of  Grade ≥ 3  AEs  across 
subgroups were seen for: 
Neutropenia, fatigue and deep vein thrombosis with a higher incidence in patients ≥ 65 years (17.6% vs. 
6.5%, 17.6% vs. 6.5%, and 17.6% vs. 3.2%, respectively). 
Neutropenia with a higher incidence in female patients (17.4% vs. 5.4%).  
However, due to the small number of patients in each of the different subgroups, these results should be 
interpreted with caution. 
Only  patients  with  adequate  renal  and  hepatic  function  at  baseline  were  eligible  for  this  study,  hence 
subgroup analyses stratified by these factors were not performed. 
No further data are presented on special populations. This is acceptable, considering the type of patients 
that the indication is applied for. 
Immunological events 
No immunological events are reported. This is acceptable considering the large number of patients treated 
with Bevacizumab for other tumours. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is no new information specific to Bevacizumab.

Discontinuation due to AES 
In study AVF3708g, 4 patients (4.8%) in the Bevacizumab arm discontinued Bevacizumab due to an AE 
(all grades) during the planned treatment period. Any given AE leading to Bevacizumab discontinuation 
was reported in single patients only in this arm. 
In the Bevacizumab + irinotecan arm, a total of 17 patients (21.5%) discontinued any component of study 
treatment  due  to  an  AE  (all  grades)  during  the  planned  treatment  period.  Fourteen  patients  (17.7%) 
discontinued  Bevacizumab  due  to  an  AE;  7  of  which  (8.9%)  were  due  to  nervous  system  disorders 
(cerebral  haemorrhage,  cerebrovascular  accident,  convulsion,  status  epilepticus,  RPLS).  Single  AEs 
leading  to  Bevacizumab  discontinuation  that  occurred  in ≥ 2%  of  treated  patients  were  cerebral 
haemorrhage (3.8%) and fatigue (2.5%).   
Fourteen patients (17.7%) discontinued irinotecan due to an AE during the planned treatment period. The 
AEs  leading  to  irinotecan  discontinuation  that  occurred  in ≥ 2%  of  treated  patients  were  fatigue  (6.3%) 
and cerebral haemorrhage (2.5%).  
In the NCI 06-C-0064E study, 9 patients (16.4%) discontinued Bevacizumab due to a Grade 3-5 AE. Six 
of  these  patients  discontinued  Bevacizumab  due  to  venous  thromboembolic  events  (3  with  pulmonary 
embolism,  2  with  deep  vein  thrombosis  and  1  with  thrombus).  Of  the  remaining  3  patients  that 
discontinued  Bevacizumab,  1  discontinued  due  to  vomiting;  1  due  to  an  infection  associated  with 
Grade ≥ 2  lymphopenia;  and  1  due  to  death,  secondary  to  cerebrovascular  ischemia  and  pulmonary 
embolism. 
Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was fairly common, but more often seen in the irinotecan 
treated patients. The influence of Bevacizumab is impossible to assess due to the lack of a comparator arm 
for this drug. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The  incidence  of  the  AEs  defined  as  of  special  interest  for  bevacizumab  were  specifically  collected  in 
AVF3708g only and were consistent with the previously established rates from patients with other types 
of cancer. Special attention is given below to those events of particular relevance to patients with recurrent 
glioblastoma, due to the inherent risks of this disease. 
the  Bevacizumab  arm,  8  had  a  prior  medical  history  of  seizure.  Similarly 
Seizure 
In  study  AVF3708g,  seizures  occurred  in  18%  and  24%  of  the  safety  evaluable  patients  in  the 
Bevacizumab and Bevacizumab+irinitecan arms, respectively. Of the 15 patients who experienced seizure 
in 
the 
Bevacizumab + irinotecan arm, 14 of the 19 patients who experienced seizures had a prior medical history 
of  seizure.  Five  patients  (6.0%) 
the 
Bevacizumab + irinotecan arm had Grade 3-5 seizure AEs. Two patients experienced Grade 5 convulsion 
(one in each arm). In the NCI 06-C-0064E study, 5 patients (9.1%) had Grade ≥ 3 seizure AEs.

in 
The  occurrence  of  seizures  is  quite  common  in  patients  with  glioblastoma,  and  it  is  part  of  the  natural 
history  of  the  disease.  Comparison  of  incidence  rates  with  expected  rates  in  patients  with  glioblastoma 
after  relapse  are  limited  by  the  lack  of  a  large  series,  and  the  inclusion  of  lower  Grade  gliomas  in  the 
published  literature.  However,  available  literature  indicates  that  seizures  can  be  expected  to  be 
experienced by 15-60% of patients with high-Grade glioma. Whether the number of patients with seizures 
in  the  studies  presented  is  higher  than  would  be  expected  is  impossible  to  evaluate  without  a  control 
group. 
Wound Healing Complication 
In  study  AVF3708g,  5  patients  (6.0%)  in  the  Bevacizumab  arm  and  2 patients  (2.5%)  in  the 
Bevacizumab + irinotecan arm experienced wound-healing complications. Four of these patients (3 in the 
the  Bevacizumab + irinotecan  arm)  experienced  craniotomy  wound-healing 
Bv  arm  and  1 
in 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
complications. In the NCI 06-C-0064E study, 1 patient had a Grade 3 wound-healing complication, but no 
patient  had  a  craniotomy  wound-healing  complication.  Craniotomy  wound  healing  complications  have 
also been reported in other glioblastoma studies with bevacizumab. 
For the purposes of historical comparison, data reported from the Glioma Outcomes Project indicated that 
patients  with  Grade  3  or  4  malignant  gliomas  who  underwent  a  second  operation  had  a  peri-operative 
wound complication rate of 1.1%. In the initial surgery trial with carmustine-wafer, healing abnormalities 
occurred in 15.8% of carmustine-wafer treated patients and 11.7% of placebo recipients. In the setting of 
surgery  for  recurrent  disease,  healing  abnormalities  were  reported  as  14%  in  patients  who  received 
carmustine-wafers compared to 5% in those receiving placebo. 
Wound  healing  complications  are  known  to  be  associated  with  the  treatment  with  Bevacizumab.  The 
incidence  in  the  studies  presented  here  are  not  alarming,  but  the  incidence  of  craniotomy  healing 
complications is worrying because of the possible dire consequences of infection in this location.  
Thromboembolic Events (Arterial and Venous) 
The  incidence  of  venous  thromboembolic  events  (VTEs)  in  study  AVF3708g  was  3.6%  in  the 
Bevacizumab arm and 10.1% in the Bevacizumab + irinotecan arm. All but one event were Grade ≥ 3 in 
severity. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis accounted for the difference between the treatment arms. 
In the NCI 06-C-0064E study, 7 patients (12.7%) developed Grade ≥ 3 VTEs, with pulmonary embolism 
being the most common (4 patients). 
The incidence of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) in study AVF3708g was 4.8% in the Bv arm and 
6.3% in the Bv + irinotecan arm. No Grade  ≥ 4 ATEs were reported, but 2 patients in each arm had Grade 
3 events (1 myocardial infarction, chest pain, cerebral ischemia, and 1 troponin increased – with Grade 2 
myocardial  ischemia).  In  the  NCI 06-C-0064E  study,  only  one  Grade ≥ 3  ATE  occurred,  a  CNS 
cerebrovascular ischemia (that together with pulmonary embolism resulted in death). 
Clinically  apparent  deep  vein  thrombosis  or  pulmonary  emboli  that  require  anticoagulation  drugs  may 
occur  in  20-30%  of  patients  with  primary  brain  tumours,  although  the  Grade  is  not  reported.  In  study 
AVF3708g,  14%  of  patients  in  the  Bv  arm  and  29%  in  the  Bv+irinotecan  arm,  received  concomitant 
anticoagulants.  The  rate  of  VTEs  in  the  AVF3708g  and  NCI  study  was  consistent  with  the  rate  of 
symptomatic VTEs seen in non-bevacizumab studies in patients with glioblastomas – 9.7%. 
Arterial  and  venous  thromboembolic  events  are  known  to  be  associated  with  the  treatment  with 
Bevacizumab. The incidence in the studies presented here are not alarming, but they do underline, that the 
side effects of Bevacizumab are not trivial.  
Cerebral Haemorrhage 
In  study  AVF3708g,  2  patients  (2.4%)  in  the  Bevacizumab  arm  and  3  patients  (3.8%)  in  the 
Bevacizumab+irinotecan  arm  experienced  cerebral  haemorrhage  events.  One  of  these  was  of  Grade  4 
severity  (Bevacizumab+irinotecan  arm),  3  were  Grade  1  and  1  was  Grade  2.  In  the  NCI 06-C-0064E 
study, no Grade ≥ 3 cerebral haemorrhage events were reported). 
Comparisons  with  the  literature  are  confounded  by  small  series  and  the  inclusion  of  other  pathologic 
conditions  that  may  predispose  a  patient  to  haemorrhage.  Although  clinically  non-relevant  haemorrhage 
has been described in the literature, the rate of clinically relevant cerebral haemorrhage appears to be low 
in  series  published  to  date.  In  a  retrospective  clinico-pathological  review  of  consecutive  brain  tumour 
cases,  up  to  29%  of  patients  with  mixed  oligodendroglioma/astrocytoma  experienced  cerebral 
haemorrhage.  In  an  autopsy  series  of  1800  primary  and  secondary  brain  tumours,  instances  of  massive 
bleeding  occurred  in  2.4%  of  cases.  Glioblastoma  patients  receiving  anticoagulant  agents  that  are 
maintained within the therapeutic range do not appear to have a greater risk of intracranial bleeding than 
those who do not need anticoagulant drugs. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  question  of  cerebral  haemorrhage  is  a  very  important  one.  From  the  data  presented  the  risk  of 
bleeding is not very high, with only three cerebral haemorrhages, one of them grade 4. Patients with brain 
tumours,  primary  or  secondary,  have  a  considerable  risk  of  bleeding  in  the  tumour,  and  the  figure 
presented for these 163 patients is rather low. This is probably attributable to the fact that AEs were only 
registered during the planned treatment period. More patients are likely to have experienced haemorrhages 
after  the  end  of  treatment  and,  in  particular,  after  progression.  Information  on  AEs  after  the  planned 
treatment  period  would  also  be  relevant.  However,  in  the  pivotal  study,  as  there  is  no  control  arm,  this 
information would be difficult to interpret, because the disease in itself increases the risk of intrecerebral 
haemorrhage.  
The  MAH  has  reviewed  all  available  safety  data  regarding  the  risk  of  cerebral  haemorrhage  during 
treatment with Bv in patients with brain metastases, both from randomized, controlled clinical trials, the 
MAH’s global safety database, epidemiological data and recently published reports on the subject.  
Overall, the risk of cerebral haemorrhage is seemingly not increased in bevacizumab treated patients with 
primary and secondary brain tumours. However, this statement is based on relatively limited data. Only 
more experience in these patients can reveal if there is an increased risk. 
In  March  2009  the  CHMP  approved  the  removal  of  a  contraindication  related  to  patients  with  brain 
metastases from the Avastin SPC.  
Furthermore, the MAH has been asked to provide an update of the safety data from study AVF3708g, with 
specific focus on VTE, cerebral haemorrhage, wound-healing complications and infections. The MAH has 
presented safety data including 42 patients who continued to receive trial treatment after the initial cut-off.   
The updated safety analysis does not reveal new safety signals. The incidence of adverse events of special 
interest was consistent with that described in the AVF3708g CSR and similar to that observed in other Bv 
Phase III trials across indications as well as historical data of patients with glioblastoma. 
Other Significant Events/Observations 
One  patient  in  the  Bevacizumab+irinotecan  arm  of  study  AVF3708g  had  reversible  posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome. No Grade ≥ 3 RPLS events were reported in the NCI 06-C-0064E study. 
Safety data from NCI-06-C-0064E 
As  reported  in  the  publication  and  summarised  in Table  4,  the  most  frequently  observed  severe  adverse 
events (defined as Grade ≥ 3) possibly or probably related to bevacizumab according to the investigator’s 
assessment of causality, were thromboembolic events (these occurred in six of the 48 patients - 12.5%). 
Three  of  these  events  were  pulmonary  emboli  and  one  was  a  cerebral  vascular  event.  The  second  most 
frequent bevacizumab-related adverse event was hypertension. All cases were ultimately controlled with 
antihypertensive medication, and no patient required removal from study due to hypertension. Overall, six 
patients  (12.5%)  were  removed  from  study  for  bevacizumab-associated  adverse  events  (five 
thromboembolic  events,  one  bowel  perforation).  Two  additional  patients  were  removed  due  to  non–
bevacizumab-related adverse events (one seizure, one opportunistic infection). No patients had intracranial 
hemorrhage. No other safety data were reported in the publication.

No new safety signals were found in this study.  
Overall conclusion on safety 
The  adverse  events  observed  with  bevacizumab  alone  were  consistent  with  previous  reports.  The 
combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan did not have a major impact on the known safety profiles of 
either bevacizumab or irinotecan individually.  Without a direct comparison it is difficult to assess the rate 
of  treatment  related  adverse  events  for  bevacizumab.  Nevertheless,  the  overall  safety  profile  of 
bevacizumab  in  glioblastoma  seems  comparable  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  bevacizumab  in  other 
indications.  In  addition,  the  rate  of  complications  of  special  interest  for  glioblastoma  patients,  is 
comparable  for  bevacizumab  treated  patients  and  historical  controls.  Considering  the  experience  with 
bevacizumab across indications, the safety profile seems acceptably defined. However, adverse events of 
special interest for glioblastoma patients should be closely monitored.  
The  MAH  recognizes  that  the  safety  data  in  some  of  the  historic  controls  (including  3  large  pooled 
analyses by Wong et al, 1999, Ballman et al. 2007 and Lamborn et al. 2008) were limited. Therefore, the 
MAH performed a more comprehensive and critical evaluation of the safety profile of Bevacizumab in the 
pivotal study compared to other available, contemporary regimens. Confounding factors were discussed in 
detail. The updated safety analysis did not reveal new safety signals. The incidence of adverse events of 
special interest was consistent with that described 
Pharmacovigilance/RMP 
The MAH provided an updated Risk Management Plan with the application for an extension of indication 
for  Avastin  (bevacizumab).  No  new  safety  concerns  specific  for  the  applied  indication  have  been 
identified.     
Discussion at the SAG-Oncology 
The SAG-O was consulted on the following questions: 
•  Does the SAG believe that an actively controlled study is necessary to decide on the benefit / risk of 
treating relapsed glioblastoma patients with bevacizumab and is such a study feasible? 
The SAG agreed that the MAH has not submitted sufficient evidence of efficacy of bevacizumab in the 
applied indication. However, the phase II data presented are very encouraging and warrant further 
investigation of the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in glioblastoma. The best way to provide 
convincing clinical evidence of efficacy and safety is through randomised controlled trials in the claimed 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indication and using an appropriate clinical endpoint such as overall survival, as well as a number of 
secondary endpoints that are conventionally studied in this setting, in particular patient-reported outcomes.  
It is acknowledged that randomised trials are difficult to conduct in this rare disease setting, but this 
should not prevent such trials to be conducted successfully. Although many neuro-oncologists are hopeful 
and may already use bevacizumab for some of their patients, for example through compassionate use 
programmes or similar programmes, this is not unusual with new agents that show  promising activity and 
per se does not undermine the feasibility of randomised trials using a parallel control without 
bevacizumab, in the proposed indication. However the definition of this control is not unequivocal in the 
absence of recognized therapeutic options. 
Besides safety and efficacy, an aspect that should also be addressed is further optimising the dose of 
bevacizumab in this indication. 
According to a minority view, however, the window of opportunity for conducting randomised controlled 
trial with this agent in this indication is no longer available as sufficient evidence of efficacy has been 
generated (see also minority view in answer to question No. 2). 
•  Would Bevacizumab therapy with the currently described safety profile, a steroid-stabilizing or even 
sparing effect, a stabilizing (or improving) effect on neurocognition and performance, and a 
demonstration of an ORR in the area of 30% (monotherapy), a PFS6 of about 40% and no clear - but 
at best - a modest prolongation of the OS, be considered as sufficient evidence of clinical benefit to 
patients with recurrent GBM compared to existing therapies?   
The data submitted are from exploratory phase II studies. These studies allow concluding that 
bevacizumab has activity in the applied indication, as measured by the radiological endpoint of objective 
response according to the criteria used in the study. However, the validity of response rate as a surrogate 
for overall survival or other important clinical endpoints has not been established in this disease and for 
this agent. The responder analysis presented by the MAH does not establish the validity of response as a 
predictor for survival as this may just be a prognostic indicator independent of treatment.  
Furthermore, one needs to be particularly cautious in interpreting response data for this class of agents that 
can interfere with contrast enhancement. There are doubts on whether contrast-enhancement MRI is a 
suitable method to monitor bevacizumab effects on richly vascularized tumours like GBM, as this may 
merely be an indication of the decreased blood flow, without altering the tumour cell content. Thus, 
objective response and other endpoints that include a radiological component, are not considered to be 
reliable to assess clinical benefit with this type of agent. Notwithstanding these weaknesses, the objective 
response rate results observed are not considered dramatic, and one cannot reasonably assume that this 
activity should translate in a clinical benefit. 
Concerning other endpoints that are claimed to measure clinical benefit, the endpoints of progression-free 
survival and overall survival are difficult to interpret in the absence of a randomised comparison against 
an adequate control. Furthermore, the progression-free survival suffers of the same drawbacks described 
for response. The historical comparisons presented may be promising but are not enough to establish 
efficacy. The results observed are not considered dramatic, and the results from historical comparisons 
cannot be considered as reliable.   
Concerning the claimed effect of maintaining or improving neuro-cognitive function, the longitudinal 
analyses presented are difficult to interpret due to missing data. Lastly, the claimed steroid-sparing effect 
and the effect on performance status are difficult to interpret as it is unclear if rigorous methodology has 
been used in order to avoid bias. 
According to a minority view, however, the data presented so far all point in the same direction and are 
convincing, particularly looking at the long duration of some responses and the relatively early onset. 
Taken all together the data presented allow assuming that the product can be of clinical benefit to some 
patients, particularly if responding to treatment after the first few cycles.

Overall Discussion and Benefit-Risk Assessment 
The MAH has emphasized that little progress has been obtained in the management of relapsed GBM for 
several  decades  and  that  the  currently  available  therapies  have  proved  disappointing  with  RRs  rarely 
exceeding 10% and typically fewer than 30% of patients being progression-free at 6 months. Ever since 
temozolomide  became  the  treatment  of  choice  as  adjuvant  chemotherapy  for  newly  diagnosed  patients 
with  GBM,  there  has  been  no  established  “gold  standard”  when  it  comes  to  the  systemic  treatment  of 
recurrent malignant GBM. Consequently, a control arm for study AVF3708g was not deemed feasible by 
the  study  investigators,  especially  in  view  of  the  promising  results  of  bevacizumab  activity  in  GBM  in 
early,  available  phase  II  data.  Furthermore,  the  MAH  puts  focus  on  the  fact  that  the  design  and 
methodology of this phase II study were robust and appropriate: It included a central pathology review, 
response assessment by use of MRI at serial 6-week intervals, and an independent radiological review of 
tumour responses. 
The  data  submitted  are  from  exploratory  phase  II  studies.  These  studies  allow  concluding  that 
bevacizumab has activity in the applied indication, as measured by the radiological endpoint of objective 
response according to the criteria used in the study. However, the validity of response rate as a surrogate 
for overall survival or other important clinical endpoints has not been established in this disease and for 
this agent. The responder analysis presented by the MAH does not establish the validity of response as a 
predictor  for  survival  as  this  may  just  be  a  prognostic  indicator  independent  of  treatment.  Furthermore, 
one needs to be particularly cautious in interpreting response data for this class of agents that can interfere 
with  contrast  enhancement.  Thus,  objective  response  and  other  endpoints  that  include  a  radiological 
component,  are  not  considered  to  be  reliable  to  assess  clinical  benefit  with  this  type  of  agent. 
Notwithstanding  these  weaknesses,  the  objective  response  rate  results  observed  are  not  considered 
dramatic,  and  one  cannot  reasonably  assume  that  this  activity  should  translate  in  a  clinical  benefit. 
Whether bevacizumab is truly superior in terms of overall survival, PFS6 or patient reported outcomes to 
other  available  therapies  is  unknown  due  to  the  lack  of  directly  comparative  trials.  The  results  of  study 
NCI  06-C-0064E  provide  some  support  for  the  anti-tumour  activity  of  bevacizumab  in  patients  with 
relapsed glioblastoma 
The feasibility to conduct an actively controlled study in relapsed grade IV glioblastoma was discussed at 
the Oral Explanation. The MAH believes that an actively controlled trial would be challenging and is not 
necessary  as  the  benefit  of  bevacizumab  is  already  established.  The  improvements  seen  in  objective 
response rate, progression free survival, steroid use, performance and neurocognitive function represent an 
important and clinically meaningful benefit for the patients. The customised surrogate endpoints seen with 
MRI  imaging  are  relevant  and  valid  in  the  context  of  this  anti-VEGF  therapy  and  they  translate  into 
clinical benefit. 
It should be noted that two large, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trials are currently assessing 
the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. 
There are currently no comparative trials running in the relapsed high grade (IV) glioma.   
The robustness of the endpoints was discussed. The MAH stated that PFS6 and ORR are robust, valid and 
predict clinical benefits for GBM patients. Challenges with MRI-imaging under treatment with a VEGF-
inhibitor  were  addressed  by  using  rigorous  methodology  of  tumour  assessment  according  the  modified 
McDonald  criteria,  independent  review  and  confirmation  by  the  NCI  study.  The  CHMP  considered  that 
endpoints  that  are  claimed  to  measure  clinical  benefit,  are  difficult  to  interpret  in  the  absence  of  a 
randomised comparison against an adequate control. Furthermore, the progression-free survival suffers of 
the same drawbacks described for response. The historical comparisons presented may be promising but 
are not enough to establish efficacy. The results observed are not considered dramatic, and the results from 
historical comparisons cannot be considered as reliable.  Concerning the claimed effect of maintaining or 
improving  neurocognitive  function,  the  longitudinal  analyses  presented  are  difficult  to  interpret  due  to 
missing data. Lastly, the claimed steroid-sparing effect and the effect on performance status are difficult to 
interpret as it is unclear if rigorous methodology has been used in order to avoid bias.

The overall safety profile of bevacizumab in glioblastoma seems comparable to the known safety profile 
of bevacizumab in other indications. 
In summary, the MAH has submitted data from exploratory phase II studies. These are compared with 
historical or contemporary external controls. The results indicate that bevacizumab may be a promising 
treatment in relapsed glioblastoma with an overall response rate in the area of 30% (as monotherapy), a 
Progression Free Survival at 6 months of about 40% and at best a modest prolongation of the Overall 
Survival while the safety profile is consistent with what is currently known for bevacizumab. These data 
need cautious interpretation in view of concerns related to the uncontrolled nature of the trial, the validity 
of response rate as a surrogate for overall survival and possible issues when applying MRI response 
criteria in the setting of VEGF inhibition.  
Although the phase II data presented are encouraging and warrant further investigation of the efficacy and 
safety of bevacizumab in glioblastoma, the CHMP considered that the MAH has not submitted sufficient 
evidence of efficacy of bevacizumab in the applied indication as a randomised controlled trial has not 
been performed.  
It is acknowledged that randomised trials are difficult to conduct in this rare disease setting, however the 
CHMP considers that such a trial is feasible and necessary to confirm clinical benefit of bevacizumab.  
For the reasons stated above the CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk of Avastin (bevacizumab) alone or 
in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV malignant 
glioma) after relapse, cannot be determined. 
Some members of the CHMP expressed a divergent position as follows: 
Although the results are derived from exploratory phase II studies, the steroid-sparing and 
stabilizing (or improving) effect on neurocognition and performance, an overall response rate in 
the area of 30% (monotherapy), a Progression Free Survival at 6 months of about 40% and a 
modest prolongation of the Overall Survival in the context of a well known safety profile can be 
considered as sufficient evidence of clinical benefit to patients with recurrent GBM with a poor 
prognosis and in view of the high unmet medical need in this clinical setting. 
It is not reasonable to expect the MAH to conduct a randomised controlled trial with this agent in 
this indication as the window of opportunity is no longer available as sufficient evidence of 
efficacy has been already generated. 
According to a minority view, however, the data presented so far all point in the same direction and are 
convincing,  particularly  looking  at  the  long  duration  of  some  responses  and  the  relatively  early  onset. 
Taken all together the data presented allow assuming that the product can be of clinical benefit to some 
patients,  particularly  if  responding  to  treatment  after  the  first  few  cycles.  Therefore,  members  of  the 
CHMP expressed a divergent position as follows:  
“- Although the results are derived from exploratory phase II studies, the steroid-sparing and stabilizing 
(or  improving)  effect  on  neurocognition  and  performance,  an  overall  response  rate  in  the  area  of  30% 
(monotherapy), a Progression Free Survival at 6 months of about 40% and a modest prolongation of the 
Overall Survival in the context of a well known safety profile can be considered as sufficient evidence of 
clinical  benefit  to  patients  with  recurrent  GBM  with  a  poor  prognosis  and  in  view  of  the  high  unmet 
medical need in this clinical setting.  
-It  is  not  reasonable  to  expect  the  MAH  to  conduct  a  randomised  controlled  trial  with  this  agent  in this 
indication as the window of opportunity is no longer available as sufficient evidence of efficacy has been 
already generated."

II.  CONCLUSION 
On  19  November  2009  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  and  agreed  that  the  changes  to  the 
terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be refused on the following grounds: 
•  The main evidence of efficacy is based on data from exploratory trials. The results in terms of 
objective response rate cannot be considered dramatic and the validity of objective response rate 
as a surrogate endpoint for clinical benefit has not been established.   
•  The results presented in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival, are difficult to 
interpret due to the lack of a randomised concurrent control.  
•  The MAH has not submitted sufficient evidence of efficacy of bevacizumab in the applied 
indication. In the absence of an established efficacy, the CHMP was of the opinion that a positive 
benefit-risk for the indication for Avastin, “as a single agent, or in combination with irinotecan, 
in the treatment of patients with glioblastoma after relapse” has not been established.

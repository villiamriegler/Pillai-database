      Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Rivaroxaban Mylan 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg 
film-coated tablets and Rivaroxaban Mylan 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets (treatment

15  mg  and  20  mg  film-coated  tablets  (treatment  initiation  pack)'s  summary  of  product 
characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential  information  to  healthcare 
professionals and patients on how it should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Rivaroxaban Mylan 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated 
tablets and Rivaroxaban Mylan 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets (treatment initiation pack) 
should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  the  information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the 
evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment 
Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Rivaroxaban 
Mylan 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets and Rivaroxaban Mylan 15 mg and

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of Rivaroxaban Mylan 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets and 
Rivaroxaban Mylan 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets (treatment initiation pack), together with 
measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Rivaroxaban 
Mylan 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets and Rivaroxaban Mylan 15 mg and 
20 mg film-coated tablets (treatment initiation pack)'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  events  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Rivaroxaban Mylan 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg 
and  20  mg  film-coated  tablets  and  Rivaroxaban  Mylan  15  mg  and  20  mg  film-coated  tablets 
(treatment initiation pack) is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
In  the  case  of  Rivaroxaban  Mylan  2.5  mg,  10  mg,  15  mg  and  20  mg  film-coated  tablets  and 
Rivaroxaban Mylan 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets (treatment initiation pack), these routine 
measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures, mentioned under relevant 
risks below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of Rivaroxaban Mylan 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets and 
Rivaroxaban Mylan 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets (treatment initiation pack) are risks that 
need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further  investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the 
medicinal product can be safely taken by patients. Important risks can be regarded as identified or 
potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
Rivaroxaban Mylan 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets and Rivaroxaban Mylan 
15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets (treatment initiation pack). Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine/use in special patient populations etc.);

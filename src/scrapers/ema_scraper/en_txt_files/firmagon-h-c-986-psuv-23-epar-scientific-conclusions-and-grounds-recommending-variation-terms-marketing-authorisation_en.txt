Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Firmagon, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
Nine cases of inappropriate schedule of drug administration were reported cumulatively with degarelix. 
In order to avoid inappropriate schedule of drug administration, section 4.2 of the SmPC and package 
leaflet should be revised to clarify that both subcutaneous injections of 120 mg each have to be 
administered consecutively. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding degarelix, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Firmagon, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance DEGARELIX is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

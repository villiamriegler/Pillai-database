Chemical class 
The  mRNA  drug  substance  in  Spikevax  is  chemically  similar  to  naturally-occurring 
mammalian mRNA with the exception that the uridine nucleoside normally present in 
mammalian  mRNA  is  fully  replaced  with  N-methyl-pseudouridine,  a  naturally-
occurring pyrimidine base present in mammalian transfer RNAs (Rozenski  et al 1999; 
Karikό et al 2005). This nucleoside is included in elasomeran Drug Substance in place 
of the normal uridine base to minimise the indiscriminate recognition of the elasomeran 
mRNA  by  pathogen-associated  molecular  pattern  receptors  (e.g.,  toll-like  receptors) 
(Desmet and Ishii 2021). The cap structure used in the mRNA is identical to the natural 
mammalian Cap 1 structure (Kozak 1991; Fechter and Brownlee 2005).

Summary of mode of action 
Spikevax encodes for the prefusion stabilized spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. After 
intramuscular  (IM;  deltoid)  injection,  cells  at  the  injection  site  take  up  the  lipid 
nanoparticle, effectively delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into 
protein. The mRNA delivery system is based on the principle and observation that cells 
in vivo can take up mRNA, translate it, and express viral protein antigen(s) in the desired 
conformation. The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with 
the genome, is nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently. The protein undergoes post-
translational modification and trafficking resulting in properly folded, fully functional 
spike glycoprotein that is inserted into the cellular membrane of the expressing cell(s).

The  spike  glycoprotein  is  membrane  bound,  mimicking  the  presentation  of  natural 
infection. 
The expressed spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is then recognized by immune cells 
as  a  foreign  antigen,  which  elicits  both  T-cell  and  B-cell  responses.  The  immune 
response  to  the  spike  glycoprotein  results  in  functional  antibody  (Ab)  and  T-cell 
responses and in the generation of memory immune cell populations. 
A modified, variant-matched bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine has been developed 
that  contains  equal  amounts of  two  mRNAs  that  encode  for  the  Spike protein of  the 
ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1) and an antigenically divergent variant of concern 
(Omicron  BA.1),  each  encapsulated  into  individual  lipid  nanoparticles,  and  co-
formulated into a single drug product (Spikevax bivalent). After delivery, both mRNAs 
are delivered to cells in the body where the two distinct spike protomers, each of which 
represents  one  of  the  three  components  of  the  spike  trimer,  are  expressed.  After 
expression these spike protomers assemble into the spike trimer and both homotrimers 
as well heterotrimers (mixed protomers from the Wuhan spike and the Variant spike), 
form. 
The inclusion of both the original and the variant spikes in the vaccine are intended to 
broaden immunity. Inclusion of the Wuhan spike allows reactivation and boosting of 
memory immune cell populations, increasing immunity that was previously present. In 
addition,  inclusion  of  the  variant  spike,  which  has  novel  functional  epitopes  present 
primarily on  the  receptor  binding  domain  (RBD)  and  the N-terminal  domain  (NTD), 
allows new naïve immune populations to be engaged and new memory responses to be 
elicited.  This  likely  broadens  immunity  not  only  to  the  spike  antigens  delivered  but 
likely also against a broader diversity of spike proteins. Furthermore, the formation of 
heterotrimers with spike protomers from both the Wuhan and Variant spikes results in 
spike trimers that are able to flex more significantly than homotrimers, resulting in more 
presentation of the receptor binding domain in an “open” or “up” conformation, versus 
the  “closed”  conformation  seen  predominantly  in  homotrimers.  In  the  open 
conformation,  key  sites  of  neutralization  not  exposed  when  the  spike  is  closed  are 
available,  providing  the  immune  system  with  more  functional  sites  with  which  to 
engage.

Elasomeran is a single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a 
cell-free  in  vitro  transcription  from  the  corresponding  DNA  templates,  encoding  the 
viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 (original).  
Imelasomeran is a single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using 
a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the 
viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron BA.1). 
Davesomeran is a single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using 
a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common 
cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). 
An outbreak of the CoV disease (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV, later 
designated SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has 
spread globally (WHO 2020a and WHO 2020b). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared 
COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020; however, by that time, there was already widespread 
community transmission in many locations. As of 25 January 2023, over 664,873,023 confirmed 
cases  and  6,724,248  deaths  have  been  attributed  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  globally  (WHO 
2023a).  Widespread  community  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  has  been  reported  in  all  WHO 
regions  (WHO  2020a  and  2020b).  WHO  has  continued  to  track  Variants  of  Concern  (VOC): 
current circulating VOCs as of 13 January 2023 are Omicron subvariants BF.7, BQ.1, BA.2.75, 
XBB, as well as additional sublineages (WHO 2023b). 
Incidence of COVID-19 in Europe 
Following the identification of SARS-CoV-2 and its global spread, large epidemics of COVID-19 
occurred in Europe. By mid-March 2020, the WHO European Region had become the epicentre 
of the pandemic, reporting over 40% of globally confirmed cases. As of 25 January 2023, 32.4% 
of global mortality from SARS-CoV-2 was from the European Region (WHO 2023a).  
The 14-day case notification rates collected by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
Control (ECDC) from 28 countries ranged from 11.0 to 611.6 per 100,000 population in the week 
3 ending on 22 January 2023. This pooled rate has been decreasing for five weeks with rates per 
100,000 population being <40 in twelve countries, 40–<100 in eight countries, 100–<300 in five 
countries (France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Slovenia) and 300 or higher in three countries 
(Austria, Cyprus and Greece). No countries reported increases in incidence  (ECDC 2023a). 
During the same period (the week 3 ending on 22 January 2023), the 14-day COVID-19 death rate 
for the EU/EEA, based on data collected by ECDC from official national sources for 26 countries 
ranged from 0.0 to 34.3 per million population, with rates 20 or higher in five countries (Croatia, 
Greece, Latvia, Slovenia, and Sweden) (ECDC 2023a).

Variants of concern (VOC) and Variants of interest (VOI) 
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 caused by the 2019 novel CoV began in Wuhan, in December 
2019, the WHO proposed labels for global COVID-19 variants of concern (VOC) and variants of 
interest (VOI) (WHO 2022a).  
Delta  was  originally  documented  in  October  2020  in  India  and  Omicron  first  documented  in 
various countries in November 2021.  The WHO current VOC are the Omicron subvariants. There 
are currently no circulating VOI listed by WHO (WHO 2022a); however, the European Centre for 
Disease Prevention and Control lists BA.2.75 and its sub-lineages, BQ.1, XBB and its sub-lineages 
(excluding XBB1.5 and its sub-lineages), XBB.1.5 as variants of interest as of 26 January 2023 
(ECDC  2023b).  Among  the  nine  countries  (Austria,  Denmark,  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Latvia, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Sweden) with an adequate volume of sequencing or genotyping 
for weeks 1 to 2 (2 to 15 January 2023), the estimated distribution of VOC or VOI ranged from 
48.4-76.0% in seven countries for BQ.1, 11.3-76.9% in nine countries for BA.5, 6.6-27.8% in eight 
countries  for  BA.2.75,  1.4-5.6%  in  six  countries  for  XBB.1.5,  0.9-6.5%  in  seven  countries  for 
XBB, 0.3-15.3% in eight countries for BA.2, and 0.1-0.9% in eight countries for BA.4 (ECDC 
2023c).      
Age specific Case Notification rates 
The 14-day case notification rate was significantly higher among elderly populations during the 
first 3 months of the pandemic. However, this shifted in late 2021 and early 2022, with younger 
age groups (<50 years old) having the highest case notification rate. This increase in notification 
rates in younger population groups can be explained by an increase in testing rates exacerbated by 
a  relaxation  of  nonpharmaceutical  interventions  (NPIs)  as  older  population  groups  achieve

vaccination including booster doses (ECDC 2023d). By the end of week 3 of 2023 (week ending 
22 January 2023), pooled rates of case notification have continued to decrease following the small 
increases that were observed during December 2022 across all age groups (ECDC 2023d).  
Incidence Among Adolescents in the EU/EEA 
Country-level and pooled case-based data reported to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) 
in the EU/EEA countries indicate that case notification rates among adolescents have decreased 
after the peak in late 2021 and early 2022 (ECDC 2023d), which coincided with the predominant 
circulation of BA.1 variants (Our World in Data 2023). 
Country-level 14-day age-specific notification rates of new COVID-19 cases were available for 
26  EU/EEA  countries  as  of  week  3  of  2023  (i.e.,  week  ending  22  January  2023)  in  TESSy 
(ECDC 2023d).  In  children  and  adolescents  <  15  years-old,  the  14-day  notification  rates  per 
100,000 population ranged from 4.57 in Greece to 270.00 in the Netherlands. Among people aged 
15-24 years, the 14-day notification rates per 100,000 population ranged from 7.35 in Spain to 
258.92 in Austria.

group from 01 March 2020 to 21 January 2023 from US CDC COVID Data Tracker (CDC 2023a). 
The older population saw slightly higher incidence than younger population in January 2023.

As  of  7  January  2023,  the  top  three  predominant  VOC  based  on  reported  genomic  sequencing 
results in the US were BQ.1.1 (34%), XBB.1.5 (26%), and BQ.1 (18%). The estimated proportion 
of XBB.1.5 was projected to increase to 61% by 28 January 2023 (CDC 2023f). 
Risk Factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes 
Age 
Age  has  been  identified  as  an  independent  risk  factor  for  severe  COVID-19  disease  outcome 
(Booth 2021). Older adults (especially those ages 50 years and older) are more likely than younger 
people to be admitted into the hospital or intensive care for COVID-19, or die from SARS-CoV2 
infection. 
Medical conditions 
According  to  the  US  CDC  (CDC  2023b),  many  conditions  were  found  to  have  a  conclusive

Main Existing Treatment Options 
Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat severe SARS-CoV-2 
infections have intensified and there is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel 
prophylactic therapies, including vaccines to prevent the spread of this disease mainly of the new 
variants. 
As of January 2023, six vaccines have been authorized for COVID prevention in the European 
Union including: Comirnaty® from BioNTech and Pfizer; Spikevax® from Moderna; Vaxzevria® 
from Astrazeneca, Jcovden from Janssen, Nuvaxovid® from Novavax, and VidPrevtyn Beta from 
Sanofi Pasteur. In addition, there are four adapted vaccines authorized for use in the EU, including: 
Comirnaty  Original/  Omicron  BA.1®  from  Pfizer,  Comirnaty  Original/Omicron  BA.4-5®  from 
Pfizer;  Spikevax  bivalent  Original/Omicron  BA.1®  from  Moderna,  and  Spikevax  bivalent 
Original/ Omicron BA.4-5® from Moderna. There are other additional vaccines currently under 
rolling  review  (Sputnik  V  [Gam-COVID-Vac]  from  Gamaleya  Institute),  COVID-19  Vaccine 
HIPRA  (PHH-1V)  (from  HIPRA  Human  Health  S.L.U.),  and  COVID-19  Vaccine  (Vero  Cell) 
Inactivated  from  Sinovac  (EMA  2023).  The  cumulative  uptake  of  COVID-19  vaccines  among 
adults (≥18 years old) as of week 3 of 2023 was 84.8% for at least one dose, 82.4% uptake of the 
primary course, and 65.4% uptake of first booster dose, and 16.9% uptake of second booster dose 
reported from 30 EU/EEA countries (ECDC 2023c). During the same period, 26.7% of paediatric 
population (<18 years old) received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccines. 
In the US, two vaccines were approved (BLA): Comirnaty® from Pfizer (23 August 2021); and 
Spikevax®  from  Moderna  (31  January  2022).  Other  vaccines  authorized  for  emergency  use 
include:  Janssen  COVID-19  vaccine,  Novavax  COVID-19  Vaccine  Adjuvanted,  Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5® from Pfizer; and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5® from 
Moderna (FDA 2023). 
In addition, the following medicinal products have been authorized in the European Union: Kineret 
(anakinra),  an  immunosuppressive  medicine;  Paxlovid  (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir),  a  protease 
inhibitor; Regkirona (regdanvimab), a monoclonal antibody medicine; RoActemra (tocilizumab), 
interleukin-6  inhibitor;  Ronapreve  (casirivimab/imdevimab),  combination  of  two  monoclonal 
antibodies;  Veklury  (remdesivir),  an  antiviral  medication;  Xevudy  (sotrovimab),  human 
neutralizing monoclonal antibody; and Evusheld (tixagevimab/ cilgavimab), combination of two 
recombinant  human  IgG1monoclonal  antibodies.  Additionally,  the  marketing  authorisation  for

Lagevrio  (molnupiravir),  a  medication  that  works  by  introducing  errors  into  the  SARS-CoV-2 
virus’ genetic code is under marketing authorization evaluation by the EMA (EMA 2023). 
In the US, a variety of treatments have been authorized by FDA for Emergency Use (FDA 2023), 
such  as  antiviral  drugs  -  Veklury  (remdesivir)  for  adults  and  certain  paediatric  patients  with 
COVID-19, Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) and Lagevrio (molnupiravir) for patients with mild-
to-moderate  COVID-19;    monoclonal  antibodies  -  Actemra®  (Tocilizumab),  Sotrovimab, 
Bamlanivimab/etesevimab,  and  REGN-COV2  (casirivimab/imdevimab);  immune  modulators  - 
Olumiant (baricitinib) and Actemra (tocilizumab) for certain hospitalised adults with COVID-19; 
and COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titres of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients 
with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment.  
Natural History of COVID-19 in the Unvaccinated Population 
Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted via direct contact or person-
to-person via respiratory droplets by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual (whether 
symptomatic or not). Airborne transmission may be possible during certain medical procedures 
and in indoor, crowded and poorly ventilated environments (WHO 2020c). Common symptoms of 
COVID-19  include  fever  and  cough,  and  other  symptoms  can  include  shortness  of  breath  or 
difficulty  breathing,  muscle  aches,  chills,  sore  throat,  headache,  and  loss  of  taste  or  smell.  In 
comparison to ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Delta and Omicron BA.1 have shorter incubation periods, 
estimated as approximately 3.7-4 days for Delta and approximately 3-3.4 days for Omicron BA.1. 
Higher infectious viral loads were detected in patients infected with Delta than in patients infected 
with  Omicron  BA.1  or  ancestral  SARS-CoV-2  (Puhach  2022).  Overall  patterns  of  shedding 
dynamics are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 variants. Infected children appear to shed SARS-
CoV-2 virus with nasopharyngeal viral loads comparable to or higher than those in adults (Heald-
Sargent 2020; DeBiasi 2021). The spectrum of illness can range from asymptomatic infection to 
severe pneumonia with  acute  respiratory distress  syndrome  (ARDS)  and  death.  Among  72,314 
persons with COVID-19 in China, 81% of cases were reported to be mild (defined as no pneumonia 
or  mild  pneumonia),  14%  were  severe  (defined  as  dyspnea,  respiratory  frequency 
≥ 30 breaths/min, SpO2 ≤ 93%, PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg, and/or lung infiltrates > 50% within 24 
to 48 hours), and 5% were critical (defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple 
organ dysfunction or failure) (Chowdhury 2020). The abnormalities seen in computed tomography 
of  the  chest  also  vary,  but  the  most  commonly  observed  are  bilateral  peripheral  ground-glass 
opacities,  with  areas  of  consolidation  developing  later  in  the  clinical  course.  Imaging  may  be 
normal early in infection and can be abnormal in the absence of symptoms. The circulating variants 
of  SARS-CoV-2  evolves  rapidly  with  different  transmissibility  and  virulence.  The  Omicron 
variant,  like  other  variants,  is  made  up  of  several  lineages  and  Sublineages,  and  share  similar 
systems  to  previous  variants.  However,  Omicron  spreads  more  easily  than  earlier  variants, 
including the Delta variant, and tends to cause less severe illness and death in general (CDC 2023c; 
Wolter 2022).  
Common laboratory findings of COVID-19 include leukopenia and lymphopenia. Other laboratory 
abnormalities  have  included  elevated  levels  of  aminotransferases,  C-reactive  protein,  D-dimer,

ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase. While COVID-19 is primarily a pulmonary disease, emerging 
data suggest that it also leads to cardiac, dermatologic, hematological, hepatic, neurological, renal, 
and other complications (Gavriatopoulou 2020).  Thromboembolic  events also occur in  patients 
with COVID-19, with the highest risk in critically ill patients.  
The understanding of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is still incomplete. Binding antibodies (bAb 
and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to develop in most individuals 
between day 10 and day 21 after infection (Ni 2020; Seydoux 2020; To 2020). Reviews of the 
published  literature  indicate  that  most  patients  develop  IgG  seropositivity  and  nAb  following 
primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 in > 91% and > 90% of cases, respectively. T-cell responses 
against  the  SARS-CoV-2  spike  protein  have  been  characterised  and  correlate  well  with 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA Ab titres in COVID-19 patients, which has important implications 
for vaccine design and long-term immune response (Braun 2020; Grifoni 2020; Weiskopf 2020). 
In general, more people were tested positive for infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in US 
and Europe by 2022, with the highest seroprevalence in the paediatric population (Clarke 2022; 
Castilla 2022; Kislaya 2023). During December 2021 to February 2022, the overall seroprevalence 
of  infection-induced  antibodies  in  US  increased  from  33.5%  to  57.7%,  with  the  highest 
seroprevalence in February 2022 among children under 12 years old (75.2%), followed by 74.2% 
in children aged 12-17 years, 63.7% in adults aged 18-49 years, 49.8% in adults aged 50-64 years, 
and 33.2% in adults aged ≥65 years (CDC 2023d). Similarly, during 26 April to 03 June 2022 the 
overall seroprevalence of infection-induced antibodies in Navarre, Spain was approximately 59% 
and decreased with advancing age, with the highest seroprevalence in children aged 5–17 years 
old (85%) (Castilla 2022). In Portugal, although the overall seroprevalence of infection-introduced 
antibodies was lower (27.3%) during 27 April to 08 June 2022, a steep increase (12—30%) in N 
IgG  seroprevalence  was  also  observed  for  all  age  groups  from  the  last  survey  in  October—
December 2021 (Kislaya 2023).  
Various studies indicate that most patients mount an immune response following a SARS-CoV-2 
infection, but that this immunity may wane over time. More recent studies found that antibody 
titres peak between 3 to 4 weeks after infection and remain relatively stable up to 4 months after 
infection (Gudbjartsson 2020). Neutralizing activity also starts to decline after 1 to 3 months from 
symptom onset, as recently reported in a series of longitudinal studies on convalescent patients 
(Baden 2021; Beaudoin-Bussières 2020; Long 2020; Perreault 2020; Prévost 2020). The longevity 
of the Ab response to SARS-CoV-2 is still to be determined, but it is known that Ab levels to other 
CoVs  wane  over  time  (range:  12  to  52 weeks  from  the  onset  of  symptoms)  and  homologous 
reinfections have been documented (Wu 2007; Kellam 2020). Reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 under 
endemic  conditions  would  likely  occur  with  medians  ranged  from  16  to  22  months  after  peak 
antibody  response  through  natural  infection  (Townsend  2021;  Townsend  2022).  Several 
observational studies report that at least two exposures to S protein, through vaccination and/or 
infection,  provide  a  degree  of  protective  immunity  (Goldberg  2022;  Andeweg  2022;  Babouee 
Flury 2022; Hansen 2023; Chin 2022), but the protection against wanes with increasing since the 
last  immunity-conferring  event.  A  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  of  65  studies  from  19 
different countries showed protection from re-infection from ancestral, alpha, and delta variants 
declined over time but remained at 78.6% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 49.8–93.6) at 40 weeks, 
while protection against re-infection by the omicron BA.1 variant declined more rapidly and was 
estimated at 36.1% (24.4–51.3) at 40 weeks. On the other hand, protection against severe disease

remained  high  for  all  variants,  with  90.2%  (95%  UI  69.7–97.5)  for  ancestral,  alpha,  and  delta 
variants, and 88.9% (84.7–90.9) for omicron BA.1 at 40 weeks (Team 2022). Most children and 
adolescents  appear  to  have  asymptomatic  or  non-severe  symptomatic  SARS-CoV-2  infections 
(Viner 2020; Forrest 2022).  SARS-CoV-2-related death in children and adolescents is rare (Smith 
2022). However, COVID-19 can lead to severe outcomes in children and adolescents (Marks 2022; 
Shi  2022;  Preston  2021).  For  example,  coinciding  with  increased  circulation  of  the  Omicron 
variant in US, COVID-19–associated hospitalisation rates among children and adolescents aged 
0–17  years  in  late  December  2021was  about  four  times  that  of  the  Delta  variant  peak,  yet  the 
proportions  of  hospitalised  children  and  adolescents  requiring  ICU  admission  (Delta  =  27.8%; 
Omicron = 20.2%) or IMV (Delta = 6.3%; Omicron = 2.3%) were significantly lower during the 
Omicron  period  (Marks  2022).    Most  common  chronic  conditions  associated  with  hospitalised 
paediatric patients are diabetes, gastrointestinal,  neurological,  cardiac,  and  pulmonary diseases, 
specifically  asthma  and  obesity,  but  some  of  these  conditions  may  not  be  necessarily  causally 
associated with COVID-19 (Forrest 2022; Bailey 2021).  
Multisystem  inflammatory  syndrome  (MIS)  is  a  rare  but  serious  condition  associated  with 
COVID-19 in which different body parts become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, 
brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. It can affect people who are younger than 21 years old 
(MIS-C) and adults 21 years and older (MIS-A) (CDC 2023e). The usual duration between acute 
infection  and  onset  of  MIS-C  symptoms  is  two  to  12  weeks  (Dufort  2020;  Ahmad  2021).  In 
contrast  to  acute  COVID-19  infection  in  children,  MIS-C  appears  to  be  a  condition  of  higher 
severity with 68% of cases having required critical care support (Radia 2021). MIS shares features 
with other paediatric inflammatory syndromes such as Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, 
and macrophage activation syndrome.  
Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 are characterised by a wide range of persistent symptoms 
such as fatigue, dyspnoea, chest pain, cognitive impairment, and sleeping disturbances that can  
last weeks, months or even years after infection (Davis 2023; Soriano 2022). Studies show that 
around 10-20% of people infected by SARS-CoV-2 may go on to develop symptoms that have 
been diagnosed as “long COVID” It is estimated that more than 17 million people across the WHO 
European Region may have experienced some form of post-COVID symptom persistence during 
the first two years of the pandemic (2020/21) (WHO 2023c). However, the exact numbers of those 
living with “long COVID” is uncertain, partly because of a lack of consensus of a case definition 
(Soriano 2022).  A systematic review and meta-analysis by ECDC indicate that the risk of post 
COVID-19 condition may be higher amongst individuals who experience more severe COVID-19 
disease (ECDC 2022).  Current and future risks to populations for post COVID-19 condition in 
the context of increased levels of vaccination and hybrid immunity remain unknown.

Table 3  summarises  the  key  nonclinical  findings  and  their  relevance  to  safety  in  humans.  In 
summary, the nonclinical package, which consisted of both studies performed with elasomeran 
and with mRNA vaccines formulated in the same SM-102 lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccine matrix 
to  support  elasomeran  use  in  human,  shows  no  important  identified  or  potential  risks.  A 
developmental  and  reproductive  study  with  elasomeran  in  female  Sprague-Dawley  rats  was 
completed in December 2020 with no adverse findings.

and specific ERD studies 
These nonclinical results show a 
lack of vaccine-enhanced 
pulmonary pathology post -
challenge with elasomeran in 
relevant animal species. 
In addition, the clinical Phase 3 
mRNA-1273-P301 study was 
designed to assess the risk of 
enhanced disease through 
continuous unblinded 
monitoring of cases by the 
DSMB with prespecified rules 
for determining harm based on 
an imbalance in cases 
unfavourable to elasomeran as 
defined in the analysis plan. 
As a result of these assessments, 
no safety concerns have been 
identified. 
Several nonclinical studies (e.g., disease 
pathology, immunoprofiling) in several 
species have been generated to address the 
theoretical risk of disease enhancement with 
elasomeran. In summary, vaccination with 
elasomeran generated a balanced ratio of IgG1 
to IgG2a in mice, indicating a Th2-biased 
response is not observed. Robust neutralizing 
antibodies were induced post-vaccination in 
mice, hamsters, and NHPs following 
vaccination with elasomeran, with the 
indication of a Th1 dominant T-cell profile in 
mouse and NHP models. T-cell response was 
not measured in hamsters.  This strengthens 
the argument that disease enhancement similar 
to that observed with previous RSV and 
measles vaccines is unlikely to be observed. 
After challenge, viral load and levels of 
replicating virus were measured in both the 
nasal passages and lungs of mice, hamsters, 
and NHPs. In animals vaccinated with higher 
doses of elasomeran, complete protection was 
observed. In animals dosed with low levels of 
elasomeran, some level of protection was 
evident, with no indications of increased viral 
load, demonstrating that ERD is not occurring. 
In addition, lung histopathology analyses after 
viral challenge in mice, hamsters, and NHPs 
post-vaccination is also reassuring, as these 
animals did not have evidence of enhanced 
disease.

observed at the injection site of the male rat 
followed by the proximal (popliteal) and distal 
(axillary) lymph nodes, consistent with 
distribution via the lymphatic system. These 
tissues, as well as spleen and eye, had tissue-
to-plasma AUC ratios > 1.0. Overall, only a 
relatively small fraction of the administered 
mRNA-1647 dose distributed to distant tissues 
(ie, lung, liver, heart, kidney, axillary distal 
lymph nodes [bilateral pooled], proximal 
popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes [bilateral 
pooled], spleen, brain, stomach, testes, eye, 
bone marrow femur [bilateral pooled], 
jejunum [middle region], and injection site 
muscle), and the mRNA constructs did not 
persist past 1 to 3 days in tissues other than 
the injection site, lymph nodes, and spleen 
where it persisted in general 5 days. 
Clinical observations included generally dose-
dependent erythema and edema at the 
injection site and transient increases in body 
temperature at 6 hours postdose returning to 
baseline 24 hours postdose were observed at ≥ 
9 µg/dose. These observations resolved or 
were considered resolving within 72 hrs.   
There were clinical chemistry and hematology 
changes consistent with inflammatory 
responses (ie, increases in white blood cells, 
neutrophils, eosinophils, and decreased 
lymphocytes); minimal coagulation changes 
consisting of a slightly increased activated 
partial thromboplastin time and an associated 
increase in fibrinogen were observed. 
Clinical chemistry results indicated a decrease 
in albumin, increase in globulin, and a 
corresponding decrease in albumin/globulin 
ratio.  
In general, clinical pathology changes were 
dose-dependent and transient.  
Consistent with other indicators of systemic 
inflammation in response to vaccine 
administration, transient cytokine increases 
were observed at ≥ 9 µg/dose at 6 hours 
postdose including interferon gamma, 
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and 
macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha. 
Increased cytokine/chemokines were 
generally resolved by the end of the 2-week

These observations were correlated with 
microscopic changes that included mixed cell 
inflammation at the injection site; increased 
cellularity and mixed cell inflammation in the 
lymph nodes.  Additionally, decreased 
cellularity in the splenic periarteriolar 
lymphoid sheath; increased myeloid 
cellularity in the bone marrow; and hepatocyte 
vacuolation and Kupffer cell hypertrophy was 
occasionally observed in the liver. Changes 
were generally reversing by the end of the 2-

Elasomeran-related clinical signs were 
consistent with previous GLP toxicology 
studies on other mRNA-based vaccines.  At 
doses ≥30 ug/dose observations included 
transient dose-dependent injection site edema 
with or without hindlimb impairment were 
observed at approximately 24 hours postdose 
and generally resolved within 7 days after 
dose administration. Clinical pathology 
associated with inflammation were observed 
and included increased neutrophils, 
eosinophils, and/or globulin. Other mild 
elasomeran-related changes observed at 30, 
60, and/or 100 µg/dose consisted of decreased 
red cell mass, reticulocytes, and lymphocytes 
and increased creatinine, triglyceride, 
cholesterol, and/or glucose. 
In general, these changes are consistent with 
the results from the previous GLP rat toxicity 
studies conducted with other mRNAs 
formulated in the SM-102 LNP. 
A developmental and reproductive toxicity 
study was performed with elasomeran in 
female Sprague-Dawley rats in December 
2020 with no adverse findings noted. 
Elasomeran was at the clinical dose of 
100 µg/dose. There were no maternal effects 
on mating and fertility, ovarian/uterine 
examinations, natural delivery or litter 
assessments. Further, there were no fetal 
and/or pup effects on in-life parameters, gross 
pathology, fetal sex, external or visceral 
assessments, or skeletal malformations. Non-
adverse, common skeletal variations 
consisting of wavy ribs and increase nodules 
were observed at 100 µg/dose. The no 
observed adverse effect level is 100 µg, which 
on a mg/kg basis, provides a 137-fold safety

SM-102, the novel lipid used in the 
elasomeran LNP formulation, was evaluated 
in as an individual agent in a bacterial reverse 
mutation (Ames) test and an in vitro 
micronucleus test in human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes. The results for SM-102 were 
negative. In addition, in vivo genotoxicity risk 
was assessed in a GLP-compliant rat 
micronucleus test using an mRNA-based 
vaccine formulated in SM-102-containing 
LNPs (mRNA-1706), the same formulation as 
elasomeran. SM-102 induced a minimal, 
statistically significant increases in MIEs in 
male rats at both 24 and 48 hours and in 
female rats at 48 hours only; however, there 
was no clear dose response, and the increases 
were generally weak and associated with 
minimal bone marrow toxicity. 
A second, non-GLP, in vivo genotoxicity 
study was conducted using NPI luciferase 
mRNA in SM-102 containing LNPs. In this 
study, there was no significant increase in the 
incidence of micronuclei.  
The results of these two studies led to an 
equivocal result.  Given the observed 
increases in body temperature observed in 
toxicology studies it is likely that drove the 
slight increases observed in micronuclei 
formation at high systemic (intravenous) 
doses. Overall, the genotoxic risk to humans is 
considered to be low due to minimal systemic

Vaccine-associated Disease Enhancement 
There was a theoretical concern over the potential for vaccine associated disease enhancement in 
recipients  of  SARS-CoV-2  vaccines.  The  concern  was  that  a  SARS-CoV-2  vaccine  could 
theoretically  cause  enhanced  disease  and  specifically  enhanced  respiratory  disease  (ERD)  in 
vaccines that were subsequently exposed to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. The potential for vaccination 
against SARS-CoV-2 to be associated with disease enhancement was a theoretical concern, given 
similar observations with other respiratory viruses in general, and in animal models of some highly 
pathogenic  CoVs.  This  concern  has  been  triggered  by  preclinical  work  on  SARS-CoV  and

MERS-CoV  vaccines  (Czub  2005;  Deming  2006;  Bolles  2011),  the  experience  with  feline 
infectious peritonitis virus and vaccines in cats (Takano 2008; Pedersen 2009; Pedersen 2012), 
and enhanced disease seen with respiratory syncytial virus, measles (Kim 1969; Polack 2007), and 
dengue vaccines in humans (Smatti 2018). Importantly, vaccine-associated disease enhancement 
has  not  been  seen  following  SARS  or  MERS  vaccines  given  to  humans,  albeit  the  number  of 
people who received these experimental vaccines remains very small. 
These events were associated either with macrophage-tropic CoVs susceptible to Ab-dependent 
enhancement  of  replication  or  with  vaccine  antigens  that  induced  Ab  with  poor  neutralizing 
activity  and  Th2-biased  responses.  The  Vaccine  Research  Center  of  the  NIH  and  the  Sponsor 
performed nonclinical studies in mice, hamsters, and nonhuman primates (NHPs) to evaluate dose-
ranging  responses  to  elasomeran  (immunogenicity),  high-dose  virus  SARS-CoV-2  challenge 
(protection),  and  to  address  the  theoretical  concern  of  ERD  mediated  by  vaccine-induced  Ab 
responses and/or T helper (Th) 2 directed T-cell responses observed with other vaccines against 
viral  respiratory  diseases.  These  studies  demonstrated  that  elasomeran  is  immunogenic  in  all 
species assessed, showing a dose-dependent response in IgG binding Ab titres and a significant 
correlation  between  bAb  and  nAb  activity.  In  addition,  antigen-specific  T-cell  responses  were 
observed in studies in mice and in the NHP study. Th1-directed CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses 
were measured post boost in animals that were vaccinated with elasomeran. Direct measurement 
of  Th1-directed  responses  in  mice  and  NHPs,  indirect  measurement  of  IgG  2a/c/IgG1  Ab 
subclasses in mice, and the high levels of nAb in all species lessens concerns regarding disease 
enhancement associated with administration of elasomeran. 
In addition to measurements of the immune response, mice, NHPs, and hamsters were challenged 
with high-dose SARS-CoV-2 virus. In these studies, dose levels of elasomeran that were predicted 
to be optimal (fully protective) and  suboptimal (subprotective)  were included. At  higher  doses, 
mice and NHPs were fully protected from viral replication in both lungs and nasal passages. At 
subprotective dose levels, animals either remained fully protected in the lungs or had reduced viral 
burden post-challenge versus control animals. There were no observations of increased viral load 
in  vaccinated  animals  at  protective  or  subprotective  dose  levels,  which  further  supports  that 
elasomeran does not drive enhanced disease. Lung histopathology assessments were performed to 
verify  reduction  of  inflammation,  immune  complex  deposition,  and  immune  cell  invasion  in 
response to viral challenge in vaccinated animals versus placebo animals. In animals vaccinated 
with both optimal and suboptimal dose levels, histopathological evaluation of the lungs of mice 
and  NHPs  confirms  the  lack  of  ERD.  This  was  demonstrated  by  the  presence  of  minimal 
inflammation  and  lack  of  significant  neutrophilic-associated  alveolar  disease  or  eosinophil-
dominant inflammatory response measured, which have historically been associated with vaccine-
associated  ERD.  In  contrast,  moderate  to  severe  inflammation  was  elicited  by  SARS-CoV-2 
infection  in  phosphate-buffered  saline  control  animal  groups,  which  often  involved  the  small 
airways and the adjacent alveolar interstitial (Corbett 2020). These nonclinical disease pathology 
and immune profiling studies show immune signatures not predicted to associate with ERD and a 
lack of vaccine-enhanced viral replication or pulmonary pathology after  challenge with SARS-
CoV-2 in relevant animal species. 
To further address the risk of enhanced disease, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained 
from study participants in the Phase 1 study and restimulated to assess the cytokine profile post 
vaccination.  The  intracellular cytokine profile of  the CD4+ and CD8+ T  cells reflected  a Th1-

rather than a Th2-directed response (Jackson 2020). These results were reassuring since the risk 
of  enhanced  disease  has  been  previously  associated  with  a  Th2-directed  immune  response.  In 
Study  mRNA-1273-P301,  prespecified  harm  rules  designed  to  detect  an  imbalance  in  cases  of 
COVID-19 or severe COVID-19 were not met. Most importantly, after a median follow-up of 2 
months after the second dose of vaccine, the majority of COVID-19 cases occurred in participants 
who received placebo rather than elasomeran (Baden 2021), confirming no clinical evidence for 
vaccine enhanced disease following vaccination with elasomeran. 
A  conclusion  of  safety  concerns  for  elasomeran  based  on  nonclinical  data  is  summarised  in

Seven clinical trials of elasomeran are ongoing and two clinical trials are completed as reported 
below. Two  of the  nine  studies  are sponsored by DMID of NIAID  and  include  a dose-ranging 
Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity study 20-0003 (Phase 1 mRNA-1273-P101) and 21-0002 to 
evaluate  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  a  SARS-CoV-2  variant  mRNA1273.351  in  naive  and 
previously vaccinated adults. Study 20-0003 is completed. The remaining six ongoing studies are 
a Phase 2/3 safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy study in healthy adolescents ages 12 to < 18 years 
including  an  evaluation  of  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  elasomeran  booster  and  bivalent 
mRNA-1273.222 vaccine given as 2 primary doses (mRNA-1273-P203); a Phase 2/3, two-part, 
dose-escalation  (open-label),  age  de-escalation  and  randomized,  observer-blind,  placebo-
controlled expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of 
elasomeran  SARS-CoV  2  vaccine  in  healthy  children  6  months  to  less  than  12  years  of  age 
including an evaluation of the immunogenicity and safety of elasomeran booster (mRNA-1273-
P204);  a  Phase  3b,  open-label,  safety  and  immunogenicity  study  of  SARS-CoV-2  elasomeran 
vaccine  in  adult  solid  organ  transplant  recipients  and  healthy  controls  (mRNA-1273-P304);  a 
pivotal Phase 3 efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity study (mRNA-1273-P301); a Phase 2/3 8-
part open-label study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of mRNA vaccine boosters for 
SARS-CoV-2 variants (mRNA-1273-P205); and a Phase 3, open-label, safety and immunogenicity 
2-part study  of  mRNA-1273.214 vaccine in healthy children 6 months to less than 6 years of age 
(mRNA 1273 P306). 
The  second  completed  study  is  a  dose-confirming  Phase  2a  safety  and  immunogenicity  study 
(mRNA-1273-P201).

mRNA-1273-P201 (Phase 2a) 
The mRNA-1273-P201 is a completed three-part, Phase 2a study: Part A, Part B, and Part C. Part 
A is a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-confirming Phase 2a safety and immunogenicity study 
(NCT04405076)  that  enrolled  600  healthy  adults  18  years  of  age  and  older  in  the  US.  Study 
participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, elasomeran 50 µg, or elasomeran 100 µg. 
The study is divided into 2 cohorts by age, Cohort 1 with 300 participants (≥ 18 to < 55 years old)

and Cohort 2 with 300 participants (≥ 55 years old). Participants received 2 doses of elasomeran 
or placebo given IM 28 days apart and were followed up until Day 394. Part A, blinded Phase 
comprised  a  Participant  Decision  Clinic  Visit  (initiation  of  Part  B)  or  Day  394  (Month  13), 
whichever was earlier.  
Part B was designed to offer participants who received placebo in Part A of this study the option 
to receive 2 injections of open label elasomeran. Participants who received 1 or 2 doses of 50 µg 
or 100 µg elasomeran in Part A were offered a single booster dose of elasomeran (50 µg) in Part 
B.  
Part C was a proof-of-concept rollover study of approximately 60 participants who were enrolled 
in Moderna’s Phase 3 mRNA-1273-P301 study, have already been unblinded, and have previously 
received 2 doses of elasomeran at least 6 months earlier. Upon enrolment into Part C of this study, 
they received a single IM injection of mRNA-1273.351 (20 µg or 50 µg) or elasomeran/mRNA-
1273.351  mixture  (50  µg  total)  at  least  6  months  after  receiving  the  second  vaccination  in  the

mRNA-1273-P203 (Phase 2/3) 
Part 1 of Phase 2/3 study (mRNA-1273-P203) is a 3-part (Part A, Part B and Part C) study of the 
safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of elasomeran in healthy adolescents ages 12 to < 18 years. 
Part  1A  is  a  randomized,  observer-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  of  adolescents  randomly 
assigned  2:1  to  receive  either  2  injections  of  100  µg  of  elasomeran  vaccine  or  2  injections  of 
placebo control each given 28 days apart. Part 1B is an open-label observational phase designed 
to offer participants who received placebo in Part 1A of the study and who meet the EUA eligibility 
criteria an option to request and receive elasomeran. The study enrolled a total of 2486 participants 
who received elasomeran vaccine. In Part 1C, all study participants were offered elasomeran as a 
50 µg booster and a total of 1346 participants 12 years to < 18 years of age who completed the 
100 µg elasomeran primary series received a 50 µg elasomeran booster dose.

Part  2  of  mRNA-1273-P203  is  an  open-label  design.  The  study  will  evaluate  the  safety, 
reactogenicity, and effectiveness of a 50 μg primary series of mRNA-1273 SARS CoV 2 vaccine 
in healthy adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age. Part 3 (open-label, single-arm design) will evaluate 
the safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of a 2-dose 50 μg primary series of mRNA-1273.222 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, administered 6 months apart, in approximately 500 healthy adolescents 12 
to <18 years of age.

effectiveness of elasomeran SARS-CoV 2 vaccine in healthy children 6 months to less than 12 
years of age.  
The study population was evaluated in 3 discrete age groups (6 years through 11 years, 2 years to 
< 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years), assessing up to 3 dosage levels (25, 50, and 100 μg) of 
elasomeran in the primary series. The study has two parts. Part 1 is the open-label, dose-escalation, 
age de-escalation phase. Part 2 is the randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion 
phase which evaluated the selected dose of elasomeran.  
In total, 751 children 6 years to < 12 years of age were treated in Part 1 (380 elasomeran 50 μg 
and 371 elasomeran 100 μg) and 4002 children 6 years to < 12 years of age were treated in Part 2 
(3007 elasomeran 50 μg and 995 placebo) (Table 32 to Table 39). Participants in Part 1 are distinct 
from those in Part 2. 
Following  evidence  of  enhanced  effectiveness  of  the  adult  booster  dose  (BD),  study 
mRNA-1273-P204 was amended to offer a BD (elasomeran, 25 µg) to all children enrolled in the 
6 through 11 years age group, which could be administered starting 6 months post-dose 2 of the 
primary series. A total of 1,294 participants received a 25 µg BD in the Booster Dose Phase of the 
study.

mRNA-1273-P304 study 
This is a Phase 3b, open-label study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 
elasomeran  SARS-CoV-2  vaccine  in  SOT  recipients  and  Healthy  controls.  Approximately  240 
participants (220 adult kidney or liver transplant recipients and 20 healthy controls) who are least 
18 years of age will be enrolled. All SOT recipients and healthy participants will receive 2 doses 
of  100  µg  of  elasomeran  28  days  apart.  The  SOT  recipients  will  be  offered  the  opportunity  to 
receive a third dose of elasomeran at Day 85. Study Endpoints included Safety and Reactogenicity 
and  adverse  events  for  12  months  after  the  last  dose.  Immunogenicity  endpoints  included 
neutralizing and binding antibody titres as surrogate endpoints to predict clinical benefit.

The  Phase  3  study  (mRNA-1273-P301)  is  an  ongoing  pivotal  two  parts  study.  Part  A  is  a 
randomized, stratified, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate safety, efficacy, and 
immunogenicity of elasomeran in adults ≥ 18 years of age conducted in the US. This study enrolled 
30,418  participants  with  no  known  history  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection,  but  whose  location  or 
circumstances put them at appreciable risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were 
randomly assigned to receive two injections of either 100 µg of elasomeran vaccine or a placebo 
control  given  28  days  apart  in  a  1:1  ratio.  The  study  enrolled  adults  at  increased  risk  of 
complications from COVID-19 based on pre-existing medical co-morbidities. The study enrolled 
participants with underlying medical conditions at increased risk of severe COVID -19 such as 
chronic lung disease, significant cardiac disease, severe obesity diabetes, liver disease, and HIV 
infection.  The  Part  B  Open-Label  Observational  Phase  of  the  study  was  prompted  by  the 
authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA. Transitioning the study to Part B permitted all 
ongoing study participants to be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria of any COVID-
19 vaccine made available under an EUA and the option to offer all ongoing study participants 
who request unblinding, an opportunity to schedule a Participation Decision Visit to know their

original  treatment  assignment  (placebo  vs.  elasomeran  vaccine).  The  Part  B  Open-Label 
Observation  Phase  also  provided  the  opportunity  for  EUA-eligible  study  participants  who 
previously received placebo to actively request to receive 2 doses of elasomeran vaccine.

mRNA-1273-P205 study 
Study  mRNA-1273-P205  is  an  ongoing,  open-label,  Phase  2/3  study  that  is  evaluating  the 
immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of mRNA vaccine boosters for SARS-CoV-2 variants 
including  mRNA-1273.211,  mRNA-1273  (Spikevax),  mRNA-1273.617.2,  mRNA-1273.213, 
mRNA-1273.529,  mRNA-1273.214 
(Spikevax  bivalent  Original/Omicron  BA.1),  and 
mRNA-1273-222 (Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5). 
The study consists of 7 parts: A, (1, 2), B, C, D, E, F, G, and H covering the following vaccines 
and doses: 
Part A.1: 50 µg mRNA-1273.211 and 100 µg mRNA-1273.211 
Part  A.2:  Second  booster  dose  50  µg  mRNA-1273.214:  Participants  who  received 
mRNA-1273.211 50 µg as a first booster dose in Part A. 
Part B: 100 µg mRNA-1273 
Part C: 50 µg mRNA-1273.617.2 and 100 µg mRNA-1273.617.2 
Part D: 50 µg mRNA-1273.213 and 100 µg mRNA-1273.213 
Part E: 100 µg mRNA-1273.213 
Part F - Cohort 1- 50 µg mRNA-1273.529: Participants who previously received 100 µg mRNA 
1273 primary series and have not received a mRNA-1273 booster dose previously. 
Part F - Cohort 2, Second booster dose 50 µg mRNA-1273.529 or 50 µg mRNA-1273 dose: 
Participants who previously received 100 µg mRNA-1273 primary series and a booster dose of 
50 µg mRNA-1273 
Part  G  –  Second  booster  dose  50  µg  mRNA-1273.214:  Participants  who  received  100  µg 
mRNA-1273 primary series and a booster dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273 
Part  H  -  Second  booster  dose  50  µg  mRNA-1273.222:  Participants  who  received  100  µg 
mRNA-1273 primary series and a booster dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273 
In total, 895 adults were treated with mRNA-1273.211 in Part A of the study including 300 adults 
treated with 50 µg mRNA-1273.211 and 595 adults treated with 100 µg mRNA-1273.211 up to 2 
February 2022 (Table 79 to Table 82). 
A  further  437  adults  were  treated  with  Spikevax  bivalent  (50  µg  elasomeran/imelasomeran)  in 
Part G  of  the  study  and  377  adults  were  treated  with  Spikevax  (50  µg  elasomeran)  in  Part  F 
(Cohort 2), up to 27 April 2022 (Table 83 to Table 86). In Part H enrolment is currently ongoing.

mRNA-1273-P306 study 
Study  mRNA-1273-P306  is  an  ongoing  open-label,  Phase  3  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and 
immunogenicity of the mRNA-1273.214 vaccine (Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1), for 
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in participants aged 6 months to < 6 years. The study consists 
of 2 parts:  
Part 1 enrolled participants aged 6 months to <6 years who have not been previously vaccinated 
against  SARS-CoV-2.  Participants  receive  2  doses  of  the  mRNA-1273.214  vaccine  (Spikevax 
bivalent  Original/Omicron  BA.1)  and  will  be  followed  for  approximately  12  months  after  the

second dose for safety and additional immunogenicity follow-up. Participants who have not been 
previously  vaccinated  against  SARS-CoV-2,  will  receive  2  IM 
injections  of  25  µg 
mRNA-1273.214 on Day 1 and Day 29. 
Part 2 enrolled participants aged 6 months to <6 years who have previously been vaccinated with 
a  mRNA-1273  (Spikevax)  primary  series  in  Study  mRNA-1273-P204.  Participants  received  a 
single booster dose of the mRNA-1273.214 vaccine (Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1), 
at  least  4  months  after  completion  of  the  mRNA-1273  (Spikevax)  primary  series  and  will  be 
followed  for  approximately  6  months  after  the  booster  dose  for  safety  and  immunogenicity. 
Participants who have previously been vaccinated with a mRNA-1273 primary series, will receive 
a single IM booster dose (BD) of 10 μg mRNA-1273.214 at least 4 months after the last dose on 
BD Day 1.

Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development Program  
Rare Adverse Drug Reactions 
The vaccine exposed population of the Phase 3 mRNA-1273-P301 study allowed the detection of 
rare  events  with  a  frequency  of  1/10,000  persons  or  0.01%.  Most  rare  AEs  of  special  interest 
(AESIs)  for  post-marketing  safety  surveillance  have  incidence  rates  lower  than  the  2/10,000 
persons or 0.02%. 
Adverse Drug Reactions of Long Latency 
The current vaccination regimen for the elasomeran vaccine consists of two doses administered 28 
days apart. There is no prolonged exposure to elasomeran. The delivered mRNA does not enter 
the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently, 
with a rapid degradation of the mRNA as demonstrated in the nonclinical biodistribution study; 
thus, no long-term sequalae due to vaccine exposure are expected. 
In both the elasomeran injection group and the placebo group in the Phase 3 mRNA-1273-P301 
study, the median follow-up time after randomization for the entire period up to the data cut-off 
for database lock (including Part A and Part B) was 212 days (range: 1 to 243 days). The median 
duration of follow-up from randomization to the PDV/unblinding (i.e., Part A) before the data cut-

off date was 148 days (range: 30 to 241 days). For participants who received both injections, the 
median  duration  of  follow-up  after  the  second  injection  to  the  data  cut-off  for  database  lock 
(including Part A and Part B) was 183 days (range: 1 to 218 days), or approximately 6 months. 
Therefore, with additional follow up time there has been more opportunity to observe potential 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that might occur with more prolonged latency.

100 μg) in Part 1 (Table 14.1.5.1) and 4002 children 6 to < 12 years of 
age (3007 elasomeran 50 μg and 995 placebo) in Part 2 (Table 14.1.5.2 
(Data extraction date: 10 November 2021)). A total of 1294 children 6 
to  < 12  years  of  age  were  administered  a  booster  dose  (elasomeran 
25 μg)  in  the  Booster  Dose  Phase  of  the  study  (Table 14.1.6.2  (Data

recommended granting an extension of indication for the COVID-19 
vaccine Spikevax to include use in children aged 6 to 11 years. 
In Study mRNA-1273-P204, a total of 224 children 2 to < 6 years of 
age  were  exposed  to  elasomeran  (69  elasomeran  25  μg  and  155 
elasomeran 50 μg) in Part 1 (Table 14.1.5.1) and 4038 children 2 to < 6

placebo)  (Table 14.1.5.2  (Data  extraction  date:  21  February  2022)). 
Furthermore, 150 children 6 months to < 2 years of age were exposed 
to  elasomeran  25  μg  in  Part  1  (Table  14.1.5.1)  and  2350  children  6 
months  to  <  2  years  of  age  were  treated  in  Part  2  (1761  elasomeran 
25 μg  and  589  placebo)  (Table 14.1.5.2  (Data  extraction  date:  21

6 months to < 2 years of age and 31 children 2 to < 6 years of age treated 
in  Part  1  (elasomeran  25  μg)  were  administered  a  booster  dose

Spikevax  monovalent  and  Spikevax  bivalent  vaccines  in  paediatric 
population is approved (see Part I). 
Pregnant  women  were  excluded  from  the  clinical  trials,  although  a 
small number of pregnancies were reported in the elasomeran clinical 
program. In mRNA-1273-P301 Part A, 16 pregnancies were reported 
in  the  elasomeran  group  and  11  pregnancies  were  reported  in  the 
placebo  group.  Of  the  outcomes  known  as  of  04 May 2021,  1 
participant  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  a  live  birth.  The 
participant was induced due to polyhydramnios and gestational diabetes 
and  the  child  was  noted  as  having  congenital  anomalies.  Five 
participants  (2  in  the  elasomeran  group  and  3 in  the  placebo  group) 
experienced  spontaneous  abortion/miscarriage.  In  Part  B,  pregnancy 
was reported for 18 participants who received elasomeran in Part A and 
19 participants who received placebo in Part A and elasomeran in Part 
B. Among the few known outcomes, spontaneous abortion/miscarriage 
was  reported  for  1  participant  in  the  elasomeran  group  and  3 
participants in the placebo–elasomeran group; elective termination was 
reported  for  1  participant  in  the  placebo–elasomeran  group.  A 
developmental  and  reproductive  study  with  elasomeran  in  female 
Sprague-Dawley rats was completed in December 2020 with no adverse 
findings.  Animal  studies  do  not  indicate  direct  or  indirect  harmful 
effects  with  respect 
to  pregnancy,  embryo/foetal  development, 
parturition or post-natal development.  
Cumulatively up to 17 December 2022, Moderna has received 5,131 
pregnancy  cases  with  16,817  events  (pregnancy  and  non-pregnancy 
specific), of which 5,467 events were serious, after receipt of Spikevax. 
Of the 5,131 pregnancy cases, 2,463 cases were medically confirmed, 
1,817 (35.4%) cases were serious, and 32 had fatal outcomes. There are 
53  reports  classified  as  stillbirth  but  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to 
support  a  causal  relationship  between  Spikevax  and  stillbirth. 
Cumulatively,  there  have  been  140  reports  of  congenital  anomalies. 
Upon medical review, 64 pregnancy reports (some contain parent-child 
duplicates) occurred in fetuses and neonates and the other 76 reports of 
congenital anomalies occurred in non-pregnancy cases. Review of the 
congenital  anomalies  indicates  that  the  anomalies  are  varied  in  type, 
aetiology, and critical gestational age at exposure; indicating that the 
anomalies  have  occurred  as  part  of  the  background  incidence  rather 
than as a result of vaccine exposure. 
Published literature has not identified any evidence of an increased risk 
of  pregnancy,  foetal  or  neonatal  complications  related  to  Spikevax 
maternal immunisation. Furthermore, published literature supports the 
favourable benefit/risk profile of maternal Spikevax immunisation as 
there is transfer of maternal antibodies to the foetus and early evidence 
that  infants  benefit  from  passive  protection  from  SARS-CoV-2 
infection  and  severe  disease 
following  maternal  COVID-19 
vaccination. Use of Spikevax in pregnancy is now embedded in clinical 
practice and included in relevant health guidelines and the SmPC states 
that Spikevax can be used during pregnancy.

Lactating women were excluded from clinical trials. There have been 
no  reports  of  women  taking  elasomeran  while  breastfeeding  in  the 
elasomeran clinical program.  Cumulatively up to 17 December 2022, 
Moderna has received 2,036 lactation cases (6,922 events) of which 527 
were  serious  cases  (2,026  serious  events);  no  cases  reported  a  fatal 
outcome. There were 508 cases medically confirmed. These cases and 
cases  from  the  literature  of  changes  in  milk  production,  infant 
irritability, decreased feeding, sleepiness/sleep disturbance, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, and pyrexia are consistent with the safety profile of Spikevax 
or what is expected in the general population (ACOG 2007; UpToDate 
2021;  UpToDate  2022).  No  safety  concerns  related  to  Spikevax 
vaccination during lactation have been identified.  
Vaccination can induce cytokines which can be passed via breast milk 
but  vaccination  while  breast-feeding  has  not  been  linked  to  adverse 
events in infants (Sachs 2013). In fact, women with fever and illness 
are encouraged to continue breast-feeding given the positive impact of 
the transfer of antibodies, which has also been reported for COVID-19 
vaccines,  as  well  as 
infant  nutritional  needs 
(UpToDate 2021).  Use  of  Spikevax  while  breast-feeding  is  now 
embedded in clinical practice and included in relevant health guidelines 
and the SmPC states that Spikevax can be used during breast-feeding.

Cumulatively, as of 17 December 2022, there were 7,559 cases (31,444 
events)  in  immunocompromised  individuals,  of  which  2,936  were 
serious cases (11,514 serious events); there were 199 cases reporting a 
fatal  outcome;  3,829  cases  were  medically  confirmed.    There  was  a 
higher  number  of  cases  reported  cumulatively  in  females  (4,785; 
63.3%) when compared to males (2,567;34.0%), with 207 cases (2.7%) 
missing gender information. Among the reported cases, the median age 
was 60.0 years with a range of 0.3 year to 101.0 years (571 cases had 
missing age information).  Cumulatively, most of the events reported a 
resolved/  resolving  outcome  (13,482;  42.9%),  with  8,482  events 
(30.2%) reported as not resolved. Review of the safety information has 
not  identified  any  patterns/trends  or  specific  safety  concerns  in  the 
immunocompromised population. Serious events and fatal reports are 
heavily  confounded  by  underlying  medical  conditions.  The  general

Cumulatively, as of 17 January 2023, a total of 1,315,850,356 doses of Spikevax (Original) had 
been delivered to 91 countries and an estimated total of 773,062,084 doses had been administered. 
North America, Europe, and Asia accounted for approximately 90% of Spikevax doses distributed 
and  approximately  84%  of  Spikevax  doses  administered.  Low-  and  middle-income  countries 
(The World Bank 2022) are estimated to account for approximately 13% of the doses distributed 
globally and approximately 13% of doses administered.

Bivalent .214 (Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1) had been delivered to 41 countries and 
an  estimated  total  of  70,896,388  doses  had  been  administered.  Europe,  Asia,  and  Canada 
accounted  for  approximately  96%  of  doses  distributed  and  approximately  96%  of  doses

Extrapolating from the proportion of US vaccine recipients to estimate global use, it is estimated 
that  421,938,298  individuals  received  a  first  dose,  278,631,565  received  a  second  dose, 
169,254,388 received a third dose, and 66,929,884 received a fourth dose, with third and fourth 
doses  including  both  original  Spikevax  (Original)  and  Spikevax  bivalent  booster  dose 
formulations. Because of variation in the timing of use of Spikevax bivalent boosters and limited 
available global data, extrapolation from the US to estimate the use of bivalent boosters was not 
deemed appropriate.

Removal  of  vaccine-associated  enhanced  disease  (VAED)  including  vaccine-associated 
enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) as an important potential risk 
Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory 
disease (VAERD) was included as an important potential risk in the RMP at the time of initial 
conditional marketing authorisation for Spikevax in the EU (06 January 2021). 
The MAH has closely monitored VAED including VAERD and presented cumulative reviews in 
Monthly Safety Summary Reports (MSSRs) as well as in Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) 
since the EUA (18 December 2020) at the request of the EMA and other health authorities. The 
most recent PSUR, PSUR #4 covering the period 19 June 2022 to 17 December 2022, presents 
detailed data supporting the removal of VAED including VAERD as an important potential risk. 
A summary of the data is presented below.  
Vaccine-associated enhanced disease was raised as a safety concern for COVID-19 vaccines early 
in the pandemic, but current evidence does not suggest that this hypothetical construct presents a

confirmed risk. More than 772 million Spikevax doses are estimated to have been administered 
since the first EUA up to 17 December 2022, and it is likely that VAED would have been observed 
and reported if it were both confirmed and more than a very rare  event. Motivation to monitor 
COVID-19 vaccine recipients for possible VAED arose from sources such as animal models in 
which  pathogenesis  suggested  a  common  potential  mechanism  producing  VAED  related  to 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines in MERS and SARS-CoV-1 (Lambert 2020). To date, 
no  pathognomonic  presentation  of  VAED  has  been  recognised  following  immunisation  of 
>902 million individuals with Spikevax vaccines. Furthermore, analysis of the immune profile of 
Spikevax in a mouse model shows elicitation of a protective immune profile that is not associated 
with vaccine-enhanced disease upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge (DiPiazza 2021). 
There is currently no widely accepted case definition for VAED; however, a recent publication by 
the  Brighton  Collaboration  provides  some  guidance  for  assessment  of  potential  VAED  in 
COVID-19 (Munoz 2021). In this guidance, it is suggested that VAED may be identified first as a 
vaccine failure (i.e., VAED requires exposure to and infection by SARS-CoV-2 in a person who 
has been fully immunised). The authors acknowledge that there is presently no pathognomonic set 
of clinical findings to characterise VAED. Furthermore,  case classifications that can be readily 
applied  to  individual-level  data  from  spontaneous  reporting  are  not  defined.  The  Brighton 
Collaboration  working  group  states  that  a  definitive  case  of  VAED  cannot  be  ascertained  with 
current knowledge of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of VAED. Probable cases must show an 
increase in severity or rates of atypical findings when compared to a non-vaccinated control group, 
however this criterion must be considered at a population or group level rather than an individual 
level.  Given  that  there  have  been  numerous  epidemiologic  studies  evaluating  effectiveness  of 
mRNA  vaccines  in  millions  of  vaccinees  and  that  there  have  not  been  findings  showing  an 
increased risk of COVID-19 disease in vaccinees (or a subgroup of vaccinees) compared to those 
not  vaccinated,  real  world  evidence  for  occurrence  of  VAED  is  lacking.  Moreover,  there  is  an 
absence  of  medical  literature  supporting  the  existence  of  VAED  due  to  Spikevax  or  mRNA 
vaccines against COVID-19. 
The  removal  of  VAED  including  VAERD  as  an  important  potential  risk  is  supported  by  the 
following considerations: 
•  The MAH has monitored VAED in each PSUR since EUA (18 Dec 2020) at the request of 
the EMA and other health authorities. Over the years of analysis and given the amount of 
safety data accumulated given the unprecedent use of these vaccines, the MAH has found 
no evidence to support the hypothesis that this phenomenon exists or that there is a causal 
relationship to the vaccine.    
•  Despite the large number of doses of Spikevax that has been administered worldwide, no 
cases of VAED have been reported to the MAH’s global safety database.  
•  As of 17 December 2022, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have not been associated with VAED in 
preclinical  studies  or  clinical  use.  Even  with  the  emergence  of  multiple  new 
variants/serotypes  of  SARS-CoV-2,  with  their  potential  to  provoke  sub-neutralising 
antibodies  in  individuals  who  have  encountered  similar  (but  poorly  cross  reactive) 
epitopes, as was the case for SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron, no enhancement of disease 
has been reported.  
•  Despite  widespread  use  of  the  Spikevax  vaccines  (>800  million  individuals  vaccinated

Page 96 
with at least one dose) there is no convincing evidence to support the hypothesis that VAED 
exists or that it has a causal relationship to the vaccine. 
•  There is no reasonable expectation that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance 
activities could further characterise the safety profile of the product with respect to VAED. 
In conclusion, the MAH considers there is sufficient justification for removing VAED including 
VAERD as an important potential risk from the RMP and proposes to continue monitoring VAED 
including VAERD through routine surveillance and ongoing post-authorisation safety studies as 
applicable. 
Removal of Use in immunocompromised subjects as missing information 
Use in immunocompromised subjects was included as missing information in the RMP at the time 
of  initial  conditional  marketing  authorisation  for  Spikevax  in  the  EU  (06  January  2021)  as 
immunocompromised and/or immunosuppressed people were excluded from the pivotal clinical 
trials (Table 95).  
The MAH has closely monitored use in immunocompromised subjects and presented cumulative 
reviews in MSSRs as well as in PSURs since the EUA (18 December 2020) at the request of the 
EMA and other health authorities. The most recent PSUR, PSUR #4 covering the period 19 June 
2022  to  17  December  2022,  presents  detailed  data  supporting  the  removal  of  use  in 
immunocompromised subjects as missing information. A summary of the data is presented below.

that  primarily  discuss 
the  context  of 
Epidemiological  studies  have  not  indicated  any  significantly  increased  risk  of  side-effects  in 
immunocompromised individuals after vaccination with Spikevax, and they have indicated that 
the safety/tolerability profile in those individuals studied is consistent with that observed in general 
populations receiving Spikevax (Sáez-Peñataro 2022; Napuri 2022). Analyses have found a higher 
risk of hospitalisation or death from COVID-19 in those with a variety of immunocompromising 
conditions,  including  rheumatic  diseases,  haematological  malignancies,  solid  organ  transplants, 
and HIV (Vijenthira 2020; Ao 2021). Factors that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 in the 
general population, such as older age, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and other 
co-morbidities,  are  significant  drivers  of  risk  in  immunocompromised  individuals.  Moreover, 
some immunodeficiencies seem to increase the risk above and beyond traditional risk factors. 
Cumulative review of post-marketing safety data has not identified any patterns/trends or specific 
safety  concerns  in  the  immunocompromised  population.  Serious  events  and  fatal  reports  are 
heavily  confounded  by  underlying  medical  conditions.  Otherwise,  the  general  pattern  of 
commonly reported adverse events in those with a medical history of immunosuppression/immune 
compromise or taking immunosuppressive concomitant medications is comparable to the general 
population.

In  general,  public  health  and  professional  groups  recommend  COVID-19  vaccination  for 
immunocompromised patients. These recommendations highlight the likely potential benefits of 
COVID-19  vaccines  in  this  population  with  the  potential  risk  of  more  severe  COVID-19 
infections,  sequelae,  and  impact  on  underlying  immune-mediated  diseases  (Botwin  2021; 
Briggs 2021; Izmirly 2022; Tang 2021). 
Currently, some countries have approved/authorised/recommend a third dose in the primary series 
as well as a fourth “booster” dose and fifth “second booster” in severely immunocompromised 
individuals,  as  well  as  a  third  booster  dose  in  mildly  immunosuppressed  individuals  (and  the 
general  population)  due  to  waning  of  immunity  and  the  emergence  of  new  variants.  A  higher 
percentage of reports for Dose 3 and Dose 4 during the review period of PSUR #4 (19 Jun 2022 to 
17 Dec 2022) compared to the cumulative period (18 Dec 2020 to 17 Dec 2022) likely reflects 
increased booster vaccination uptake and reporting of booster cases in the immunocompromised 
subpopulation during this period. 
After  careful  review  of  all  new  safety  data  for  the  safety  topic  of  use  in  immunocompromised 
individuals, and given that this population is at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 infection, 
the benefit-risk profile for Spikevax remains favourable. Over the years of analysis and the large 
scale of use of Spikevax (and other COVID-19) vaccines and boosters, the MAH has found: 
•  Review of the safety data in immunocompromised subjects reported in the global safety 
database indicates that the general pattern of commonly reported adverse events in those 
with  a  medical  history  of 
taking 
immunosuppressive  concomitant  medications  is  comparable  to  the  general  population, 
rather than as a result of vaccine exposure. 
immunosuppression/immune  compromise  or 
•  The  MAH  continues  to  evaluate  use  in  immunocompromised  subjects  in  reports  of 
Spikevax (Original and Bivalent Boosters) via routine pharmacovigilance activities as well 
as through post-authorisation safety studies.  
•  Throughout the world all the EUA received for Spikevax includes recommendations for 
additional doses for immunocompromised subjects   
•  Use  of  Spikevax  in  immunocompromised  subjects  is  embedded  in  clinical  practice  and 
included in relevant health guidelines and no longer constitute missing information in the 
safety profile of Spikevax. 
•  Data from study mRNA-1273-P304, a Phase 3b, open-label study to evaluate the safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in solid organ 
transplant (SOT) recipients and healthy participants showed that the 3-dose primary series 
and  BD  of  mRNA-1273  were  well  tolerated  with  an  acceptable  safety  profile  in 
immunocompromised post-transplant population. 
•  Data  from  study  mRNA-1273-P904  showed  that  all  AESI  that  met  threshold  for  SCRI 
analysis in the IC population also met the threshold in the general population, and no new 
risks specific to immunocompromised persons were identified. 
•  A  comprehensive  review  of  the  published  literature  did  not  identify  any  elasomeran 
immunization safety concerns for the immunocompromised (IC) population. The literature 
search yielded 579 articles. The articles were medically/scientifically reviewed to identify

Original/Omicron BA.1, and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
Page 98 
articles relevant to the safety and benefit/risk profile of Spikevax/Elasomeran in the context 
of  the  IC  population.  There  were  402  articles  that  discussed  COVID-19  disease  or  its 
impact  on  IC  individuals,  effect  of  the  pandemic  on  the  IC,  therapeutic  approaches  for 
treatment  of  IC  individuals,  case  reports/series,  review  articles  and  studies  that  did  not 
include  SPIKEVAX  /Elasomeran  and/or  mRNA  vaccines.  The  remaining  177  articles 
contained information regarding mRNA vaccine administration in the IC population. Most 
of these articles discussed information in the context of IC individuals with the possibility 
of lower immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine, the need for booster doses due to the 
waning  immune  response  over  time  and  the  emergence  of  variants  (Omicron)  and 
subvariants, the effectiveness of the vaccine and risk factors for breakthrough COVID-19 
and severe COVID-19 disease.  The literature demonstrates that for IC individuals, the risk 
of COVID-19 infection is related to significant morbidity and mortality.  This most recent 
assessment  of  the  literature  concerning  the  use  of  Spikevax  and  mRNA  vaccines  is 
associated with significantly less severe outcomes in COVID-19 infections. 
•  Overall,  the  published  data  reviewed  through  this  literature  search  support  a  positive 
benefit-risk  of  the  use  of  elasomeran  for  the  IC  subpopulation  and  support  the 
understanding of the use of the vaccine in this subpopulation.  
The removal of use in immunocompromised subjects as missing information is supported by the 
following considerations: 
•  Extended use of the Spikevax vaccines in immunocompromised individuals has provided 
extensive  safety  information  in  this  sub-population  group  to  no  longer  be  considered 
missing information.  
•  Use of Spikevax in immunocompromised individuals is already included in the SmPC and 
embedded  in  clinical  practice  and  included  in  relevant  health  guidelines  and  no  longer 
constitute missing information in the safety profile of Spikevax. 
•  There is no reasonable expectation that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance 
activities could further characterise the safety profile of the product with respect to use in 
immunocompromised  subjects  as  long-term  safety  is  being  maintained  as  missing 
information. 
In  conclusion,  the  MAH  considers  there  is  sufficient  justification  for  removing  use  in 
immunocompromised  subjects as missing information  from  the  RMP and  proposes to continue

Removal of Interactions with other vaccines as missing information 
Interactions with other vaccines was included as missing information in the RMP at the time of 
initial conditional marketing authorisation for Spikevax in the EU (06 January 2021).  
The  MAH  has  closely  monitored  interactions  with  other  vaccines  and  presented  cumulative 
reviews in MSSRs as well as in PSURs since the EUA (18 December 2020) at the request of the

2022  to  17  December  2022,  presents  detailed  data  supporting  the  removal  of  interactions  with 
other vaccines as missing information. A summary of the data is presented below. 
The  safety  profile  of  Spikevax  when  co-administered  with  non-COVID-19  vaccines  is  being 
monitored, including their use with the new Spikevax bivalent vaccines. As COVID-19 vaccines 
become available to children who are also being vaccinated against childhood infectious diseases, 
the safety and efficacy of coadministration is being evaluated with routine surveillance activities. 
Overall, cumulatively up to 17 December 2022, adverse events reported for individuals receiving 
non-COVID-19 vaccines concomitantly with Spikevax, were generally comparable to those seen 
in  the  general  population  after  vaccination  with  non-COVID-19  vaccines  and  were  related  to 
reactogenicity  events  commonly  seeing  after  vaccination  with  Spikevax.  A  review  of  the  data 
showed that events reported in individuals receiving concurrent vaccines with Spikevax continue 
to  primarily  occur  in  individuals  >50  years  of  age,  with  a  higher  number  of  reports  involving 
females, as it is seeing in the general population, with a time to onset (TTO) of less than 7 days. 
Reports in the paediatric population comprised mainly product administration errors. The highest 
reported events were seen with coadministration with the influenza vaccine.  
Available evidence on COVID-19 vaccine coadministration with influenza vaccine does not show 
increased  adverse  events.  Therefore,  WHO  considers  that  coadministration  of  an  inactivated 
seasonal  influenza  vaccine  and  any  dose  of  a  COVID-19  vaccine  is  acceptable,  given  that  the 
known risk of serious illness for adults infected with influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 is substantial. 
The cumulative review of the safety information did not identify any patterns/trends or specific 
safety concerns in individuals receiving concurrent vaccines with Spikevax. Serious events and 
fatal reports were heavily confounded by underlying medical conditions. Otherwise, the general 
pattern of commonly reported adverse events in those individuals receiving concurrent vaccines 
with Spikevax was comparable to the general population. No interactions between Spikevax and 
other non-COVID-19 vaccines have been observed. 
After careful review of all new safety data received for the safety topic of interaction with other 
vaccines, the benefit-risk profile for Spikevax remains favourable. Over the years of analysis and 
the large scale of use of Spikevax (and other COVID-19) vaccines and boosters, the MAH has 
found: 
•  Review  of  the  safety  data  on  individuals  receiving  concurrent  vaccines  with  Spikevax 
reported  in  the  global  safety  database  indicates  that  the  general  pattern  of  commonly 
reported  adverse  events  are  consistent  with  expected  reactogenicity  events  and  are 
comparable  to  events  observed  in  the  general  population  receiving  other  widely  used 
vaccines. 
•  Available evidence on COVID-19 vaccine coadministration with influenza vaccine does 
not  show  an  increase  in  reporting  of  adverse  events.  Health  authorities  consider  that 
coadministration of an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine and any dose of a COVID-19 
vaccine is acceptable, given that the known risk of serious illness for adults infected with 
influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 is substantial. 
•  Use  of  Spikevax  with  other  vaccines,  including  childhood  immunisation  vaccines  is 
embedded  in  clinical  practice  and  included  in  relevant  health  guidelines  and  no  longer 
constitute missing information in the safety profile of Spikevax.

The  removal  of  interaction  with  other  vaccines  as  missing  information  is  supported  by  the 
following considerations: 
•  Extended use of the Spikevax vaccines in conjunction with other vaccines has provided 
extensive safety information for interactions with other vaccines to no longer be considered 
missing information.  
•  Concomitant  use  of  other  vaccines  with  Spikevax  is  included  in  the  SmPC:  High  dose 
quadrivalent influenza vaccine can be concomitantly administered with Spikevax. 
•  The  MAH  continues  to  evaluate  interaction  with  other  vaccines  in  reports  of  Spikevax 
(Original  and  Bivalent  Boosters)  via  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  as  well  as 
through post-authorisation safety studies.   
•  Concomitant  use  of  the  vaccine  with  the  influenza  vaccine  is  already  included  in  the 
product’s labelling, and the use of Spikevax with other vaccines is embedded in clinical 
practice  and  included  in  relevant  health  guidelines  and  no  longer  constitute  missing 
information in the safety profile of Spikevax. 
•  There is no reasonable expectation that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance 
activities  could  further  characterise  the  safety  profile  of  the  product  with  respect  to 
interaction  with  other  vaccines  as  long-term  safety  is  being  maintained  as  missing 
information. 
In conclusion, the MAH considers there is sufficient justification for removing interactions with 
other  vaccines  as  missing  information  from  the  RMP,  and  proposes  to  continue  monitoring 
interactions with other vaccines through routine surveillance and ongoing post-authorisation safety 
studies as applicable. 
Removal  of  use  in  frail  subjects  with  unstable  health  conditions  and  co-morbidities 
(e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, 
cardiovascular disorders) as missing information 
Use  in  frail  subjects  with  unstable  health  conditions  and  co-morbidities  (e.g.,  COPD,  diabetes, 
chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) was included as missing information in the 
RMP at the time of initial conditional marketing authorisation for Spikevax in the EU (06 January 
2021).  
The  MAH  has  closely  monitored  use  in  frail  subjects  with  unstable  health  conditions  and 
co-morbidities (e.g., COPD, diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) and 
presented cumulative reviews in MSSRs as well as in PSURs since the EUA (18 December 2020) 
at the request of the EMA and other health authorities. The most recent PSUR, PSUR #4 covering 
the period 19 June 2022 to 17 December 2022, presents detailed data supporting the removal of 
use  in  frail  subjects  with  unstable  health  conditions  and  co-morbidities  (e.g.,  COPD,  diabetes, 
chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) as missing information. A summary of the 
data is presented below. 
Frail patients are considered at higher risk of complications due to COVID-19 infection including 
hospitalisations and deaths; and for this reason, are prioritised candidates for vaccination. Since 
frail  subjects  with  unstable  health  conditions  and  co-morbidities  were  excluded  from  the

registration  trials,  ModernaTx,  Inc  is  characterising  safety  through  post-marketing  routine 
monitoring of adverse events in this special subpopulation. Frailty refers to a state of vulnerability 
to stressors characterised by a decreased physiological reserve, resulting in poor health outcomes 
compared to individuals of the same chronological age (Rockwood 2018). 
There  is  growing  evidence  to  supporting  the  safety  profile  of  the  COVID-19  vaccine  in 
immunocompromised  patients,  such  as  HIV-infected  patients,  diabetics,  and  patients  with 
cardiopulmonary diseases, is similar to that in the general population. Presently, the US Centers 
for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  British  Society  for  Immunology,  and  various  other 
governmental and professional societies and organisations endorse COVID-19 vaccination in the 
immunocompromised  population.  Overall,  recommendations  for  use 
in  patients  with 
immunocompromising medical conditions and immunosuppressing medications on the efficacy of 
the vaccine may support the extrapolation into the frail subpopulation indicating potential benefits 
to outweigh theoretical risks. The frail population was the first sub-population group vaccinated 
with Spikevax and other COVID-19 vaccines given that this population was recognised to have 
the  potential  for  more  severe  complications  due  to  COVID-19  infection.  This  same 
recommendation is still in place for vaccination against SARS-CoV2 and its variants. 
Overall,  the  general  pattern  of  commonly  reported  adverse  events  in  the  frail  subpopulation  is 
consistent with expected Spikevax reactogenicity and comparable to those events observed in the 
general population and in patients with these underlying conditions, especially the elderly. This is 
to be expected, as the elderly comprise 30.2% of the frail subpopulation in the reporting period of 
PSUR #4. 
As  expected  with  the  time  course  of  reactogenicity  events  observed  in  the  general  population, 
event clustering in the frail subpopulation was observed in the three-day window after vaccination, 
irrespective of dose number. Notably, reports of event term COVID-19 were much less prevalent 
in serious cases in the frail subpopulation (1.3%) compared to the general population (2.0%). This 
is likely due to the preferential roll out of boosters to this frail subpopulation in many countries. 
The most frequently reported event terms in serious cases in the frail subpopulation closely match 
those seen both in the elderly population and in the general population as a whole. Fatal cases in 
the  frail  subpopulation  in  the  reporting  period  (2.0%)  were  strongly  confounded  by  multiple 
co-morbidities and the advanced age in the elderly, which comprise a little less than a third of the 
frail subgroup. 
Case reports across all available vaccines after doses 3 and above have increased as expected with 
uptake  of  booster  doses  administered  in  many  countries  in  the  period  of  PSUR  #4.  With  this 
increase  in  booster  dosing,  more  events  were  reported  after  dose  3  than  any  other  dose  in  this 
reporting period. The adverse event profile observed after booster doses in the frail subpopulation 
is similar to that seen in the general population, notably as reactogenicity events with similar time 
to onset for dose 3 as after dose 1 and dose 2. 
The few cases reported in frail children and adolescent subpopulations did not reveal any new or 
unusual pattern of events.  
With the scale in distribution of Spikevax bivalent vaccines to frail and vulnerable groups globally, 
the accumulated safety data have not revealed any safety concerns or significant novel events in 
the frail subpopulation or key differences among the various types of vaccines, compared to the 
general population.

The MAH has monitored use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities 
in each MSSR as well as PSURs since EUA (18 Dec 2020) at the request of the EMA and other 
health authorities. Over the years of analysis and the large scale of use of Spikevax (and other 
COVID-19) vaccines and boosters, the MAH has found:  
•  Review  of  the  safety  data  in  frail  subjects  with  unstable  health  conditions  and 
co-morbidities reported in the global safety database indicates that the general pattern of 
commonly reported adverse events in those frail subjects with unstable health conditions 
and  co-morbidities  is  comparable  to  the  general  population,  rather  than  as  a  result  of 
vaccine exposure. 
•  The MAH continues to evaluate use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and 
co-morbidities  in  reports  of  Spikevax  (Original  and  Bivalent  Boosters)  via  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities as well as through post-authorisation safety studies.  
•  Use of Spikevax in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities has 
become  fully  integrated  into  standard  clinical  practice,  such  as  inclusion  into  treatment 
protocols or clinical guidelines and no longer constitutes missing information in the safety 
profile of Spikevax. 
The  removal  of  use  in  frail  subjects  with  unstable  health  conditions  and  co-morbidities  (e.g., 
COPD, diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) as missing information is 
supported by the following considerations: 
•  Extensive use of the Spikevax vaccines (>800 million individuals vaccinated with at least 
one dose), including in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities, 
has  provided  extensive  safety  information  in  this  sub-population  group  to  no  longer  be 
considered missing information. 
•  The MAH continues to evaluate use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and 
co-morbidities  in  reports  of  Spikevax  (Original  and  Bivalent  Boosters)  via  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities as well as through post-authorisation safety studies.  
•  There is no reasonable expectation that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance 
activities could further characterise the safety profile of Spikevax with respect to use in 
frail  subjects  with  unstable  health  conditions  and  co-morbidities  as  long-term  safety  is 
being maintained as missing information. 
In conclusion, the MAH considers there is sufficient justification for removing use in frail subjects 
with unstable health  conditions  and co-morbidities (e.g., COPD, diabetes, chronic  neurological 
disease, cardiovascular disorders) as missing information from the RMP, and proposes to continue 
monitoring  use  in  frail  individuals  with  unstable  health  conditions  and  co-morbidities  through 
routine surveillance and ongoing post-authorisation safety studies as applicable.

impact  on  underlying 
Of  note,  those  individuals  with  AI/ID  may  be  on  immunosuppressive  medications,  which  may 
reduce the immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccine and may be a risk factor for more severe 
COVID-19 disease (Duly 2022; Tallantyre 2022).  
Exacerbation of autoimmune conditions can be related to inflammation caused by infections and 
thus it is hypothetically possible that such exacerbations could be related to the immune response 
to  vaccines,  including  mRNA  COVID-19  vaccines  (Torres-Aguilar  2019;  Watad  2021; 
Ishay 2021). While decreased immunogenicity for those on immunosuppressive therapies and the 
hypothetical risk of disease exacerbation have been recognised by professional and public health 
organisations,  given  the  risk  of  more  severe  COVID-19  and  sequelae,  vaccination  is  generally 
recommended  with  monitoring  and  management  of  any  potential  flare  or  exacerbation  after 
vaccination.  
Thus  far,  there  have  been  no  specific  safety  concerns  identified  for  individuals  with  AI/ID. 
Epidemiological  studies  have  not  indicated  any  significantly  increased  risk  of  side-effects  in 
individuals with AI/ID after vaccination with Spikevax. Epidemiological studies have indicated 
that the safety/tolerability profile in those individuals studied is consistent with that observed in 
general  populations  receiving  Spikevax  (Giannoccaro  2022;  Machado  2021;  Sattui  2021; 
Lupo-Stanghellini 2022).  
In the review period for PSUR #4 and cumulatively, the most frequently reported events (pyrexia, 
fatigue, headache, chills, myalgia, nausea, and arthralgia) among medical history of autoimmune 
and/or  inflammatory  disease  (MedHx  AI/ID)  cases  receiving  Spikevax  (both  Original  and 
Bivalents)  represent  expected  reactogenicity.  The  types  and  distribution of  the  most  frequently 
reported events is comparable to those observed with Spikevax (Original) in MedHx AI/ID cases 
and  those  receiving  Spikevax  Bivalent  .214  (Original/BA.1)  or  SPIKEVAX  Bivalent.222 
(Original/BA.4/5).  
During  the  reporting  period  for  PSUR  #4,  the  potential  cases  of  exacerbation  of  underlying 
autoimmune and inflammatory disorders reported after vaccination with Spikevax (Original and

bivalent  vaccines)  may  have  limited  information  and  lack  a  description  of  the  baseline  disease 
status  or  historic  pattern  of  flares,  the  clinical  course,  diagnostics/labs/imaging,  treatment, 
outcome, clear time to onset and/or dose number. Those reports also include signs and symptoms 
of reactogenicity that  could mimic signs and  symptoms  of autoimmune  disease  (such  as fever, 
myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia, headache), and thus it may be difficult to fully differentiate transient 
reactogenicity  from  AI/ID  reactivation/flare.  Given  the  natural  waxing  and  waning  course  of 
AI/ID, and that there are no reliable reference data of the background rates of respective flares, the 
cases do not represent a safety concern at this time. 
The MAH has monitored use in individuals with AI/ID in each MSSR as well as PSURs since 
EUA (18  Dec 2020) at  the  request of the  EMA  and  other  health authorities.  Over the  years of 
analysis and the large scale of use of Spikevax (and other COVID-19) vaccines and boosters, the 
MAH has found:  
•  Review of the safety  data individuals  with  AI/ID  reported in the global safety database 
indicates  that  the  general  pattern  of  commonly  reported  adverse  events  in  those  with  a 
medical  history  of  autoimmune/inflammatory  disorder  is  comparable  to  the  general 
population, rather than as a result of vaccine exposure. 
•  Exacerbation  of  autoimmune  conditions  can  be  related  to  inflammation  caused  by 
infections and thus it is hypothetically possible that such exacerbations could be related to 
the immune response to vaccines, including mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. This has been 
recognised  by  professional  and  public  health  organisations;  yet,  given  the  risk  of  the 
potential consequences of COVID-19 infection, some are recommending vaccination with 
monitoring  and  management  of  any  potential  flare  or  exacerbation  occurring  after 
vaccination.  In  addition,  those  individuals  with  AI/ID  may  be  on  immunosuppressive 
medications, which may reduce the immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccine, and/or 
make them more susceptible to infections. 
•  Use of Spikevax in individuals with AI/ID is embedded in clinical practice and included in 
the SmPC and relevant health guidelines. 
•  The  MAH  continues  to  evaluate  use  in  individuals  with  autoimmune  and  inflammatory 
disorders  (AI/ID)  in  reports  of  Spikevax  (Original  and  Bivalent  Boosters)  via  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities as well as through post-authorisation safety studies. 
The  removal  of  use  in  individuals  with  autoimmune  and  inflammatory  disorders  as  missing 
information is supported by the following considerations: 
•  Extended use of the Spikevax vaccines (>800 million individuals vaccinated with at least 
one  dose)  has  provided  extensive  safety  information  including  individuals  with 
autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (AI/ID) to support the removal of this population 
as missing information.  
•  There is no reasonable expectation that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance 
activities  could  further  characterise  the  safety  profile  of  the  product  with  respect  to 
individuals with autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.

autoimmune or inflammatory disorders as missing information from the  RMP, and proposes to

Myocarditis 
Myocarditis is an under-diagnosed cardiac disease resulting from any one 
of  a  broad  range  of  infectious,  immune,  and  toxic  causes.  Most  cases  of 
myocarditis  are  caused  by  infectious  agents,  toxic  substances,  drugs  or 
autoimmune disorders. Hence, it is increasingly recognized that myocarditis 
is an inflammatory condition of the myocardium triggered by various factors 
rather  than  a  distinct  cardiovascular  disease.  Infectious  causes  include 
viruses, bacteria, Chlamydia, rickettsia, fungi, and protozoa. Noninfectious 
triggers  have  been  identified  such  as  toxins,  auto  immunes  disease  and 
hypersensitive  reactions.  Numerous  medications  like  antipsychotics  (e.g., 
clozapine), antibiotics (penicillin, ampicillin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines), 
induce  hypersensitivity 
and  antiphlogistic 
eosinophilic  myocarditis.  Myocarditis  has  been  reported  following  many 
different vaccines including flu vaccine, however the smallpox vaccine has 
the strongest association. During the influenza epidemic of the winter 1998-
1999  there  were  several  reports  of  patients  who  had  preceding  flu-like 
symptoms and fever and developed cardiac involvement between 4 and 7 
days after the onset of influenza symptoms (Onitsuka 2001). 
Evaluation of the post-authorization safety data suggest a very rare risk of 
myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, the mechanisms involved 
in such vaccine-related myocarditis are not clear based on the data 
currently available. 
Data to evaluate the safety concern were derived from clinical trials and 
the post-authorisation safety. 
In  Study  mRNA-1273-P301  (Part  A),  there  were  15,184  participants 
exposed to the elasomeran vaccine, and 15,166 participants in the placebo 
arm. There were no reported TEAEs of Myocarditis follow-up period after 
vaccination.  No  cases  have  been  reported  in  Part  B  of  the  study  (CSR 
mRNA-1273-P301 addendum 1 (Safety from open label phase [Part B]). 
Using post authorization safety data, an evaluation of all the cases identified 
as cases of Myocarditis, utilizing the WHO-UMC causality assessment and 
the  newly  developed  DRAFT  Myocarditis  Brighton  Collaboration  case 
definition (30 May 2021) was conducted. A total of 77 cases were identified. 
Analysis of the 77 cases that reported events of myocarditis using the WHO-
UMC  standardized  case  causality  assessment  revealed  that  there  were  20 
reports  (8%  of  the  Myocarditis  cases)  classified  as  “Possible”  events,  11 
reports  were  classified  as  “Conditional”,  17  reports  were  classified  as 
“Unlikely”, and 29 were classified as “Unassessable”. Of the “Possible” 20 
cases, there were 18 males and 2 females. Their ages were between 18 and 
52  years  of  age.  The  reported  TTO  was  between  0  days  and  10  days 
(Median=  3  days).  The  20  reports  that  were  classified  as  “Possible” 
according  to  the  WHO-UMC  causality  assessment,  were  evaluated 
according to the Myocarditis Brighton Collaboration case definition. Out of 
the 20 possible reports, there were 2 classified as Level 1 (Definitive case); 
12 classified as Level 2 (Probable case); and 6 were classified as Level 4 (a

reported event of myocarditis with insufficient evidence to meet level 1,2 or 
3 of the case definition). 
As of DLP of this RMP, there were 362 cases of Myocarditis reported. The 
corresponding reporting rate of myocarditis was 3.45 per 100,000 person – 
years based on a 21-day risk window following each dose of vaccine 
administered. 
Approximately  1%  to  5%  of  patients  that  test  positive  for  acute  viral 
infection(s) may exhibit a form of myocarditis. The annual prevalence of 
myocarditis has been reported from 10.2 to 105.6 per 100,000 worldwide, 
and its annual occurrence is estimated at about 1.8 million cases. 
Most studies of acute myocarditis report a greater prevalence and severity 
in male patients, speculated to be caused by a protective effect of natural 
hormonal influences on immune responses in women when compared with 
men (Golpour 2021). Patients are usually between the ages of 20 and 50. 
Acute myocarditis and hyperthyroidism are also common diseases that often 
present in young, otherwise healthy patients. 
The spontaneous reports included in the global safety database included 4 
cases that reported previous COVID-19 infection (5.9%) with these reports 
in  the  18  to  39  years  of  age  group.  There  were  5  reports  of  previous 
Myocarditis/  Pericarditis  medical  history 
reports  of 
cardiovascular conditions (16.5%), 5 with Thyroid conditions (5.9%), and 
12  (14.1%)  had  previous  medical  histories  of  allergy-type  conditions 
including history of anaphylaxis. 
(5.9%),  14 
Myocarditis  presents  with  a  spectrum  of  symptoms  ranging  from  mild 
dyspnea  or  chest  pain  that  spontaneously  resolves  without  treatment  to 
cardiogenic shock and sudden death. The major long-term consequence is 
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with chronic heart failure. Common viral 
infections are the most frequent cause of myocarditis, but other pathogens, 
hypersensitivity reactions, and systemic and autoimmune diseases have also 
been implicated (Blauwet 2009). 
Very  rare  cases  of  myocarditis  and  pericarditis  have  been  observed 
following vaccination with Spikevax. These cases have primarily occurred 
within  14  days  following  vaccination,  more  often  after  the  second 
vaccination, and more often in younger men. Available data suggest that the 
course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different 
from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.  
Healthcare  professionals  should  be  alert  to  the  signs  and  symptoms  of 
myocarditis  and  pericarditis.  Vaccinees  should  be  instructed  to  seek 
immediate  medical  attention  if  they  develop  symptoms  indicative  of 
myocarditis  or  pericarditis  such  as  (acute  and  persisting)  chest  pain, 
shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare  professionals  should  consult  guidance  and/or  specialists  to 
diagnose and treat this condition. 
For  patients  presenting  with  myocarditis  or  pericarditis  after  the  1st  dose 
CDC  recommends  deferring  the  2nd  dose  of  mRNA  COVID-19  vaccine 
until more information is known. However, if heart has recovered, it could 
consider proceeding with 2nd dose (Wallace 2021). 
Current  SmPC  and  PIL  adequately  covers  the  information  on  this  risk 
awareness to the health care professionals, caregivers and vaccinees. 
Based on the analysis of all the safety data, there have been very rare reports 
of  myocarditis  occurring  after  vaccination  with  Moderna  COVID-19 
Vaccine.  Causal  association  between  Spikevax  and  myocarditis  is 
considered  of  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility.  The  majority  of  the  cases

have been reported in young males, and shortly after the second dose of the 
vaccine.  These  are  typically  mild  cases  and  individuals  tend  to  recover 
within  a  short  time  following  standard  treatment  and  rest.  Healthcare 
professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis. The 
benefits (prevention of COVID-19 disease and associated hospitalizations, 
ICU  admissions,  and  deaths)  outweighed  the  risks  (expected  myocarditis 
cases after vaccination) in all populations for which vaccination has been 
recommended (Gargano 2021). 
Myocarditis  associated  with  vaccines  typically  occur  at  a  low  incidence, 
which results in a low public health impact. Although the potential clinical 
consequences  of  the  occurrence  of  myocarditis  is  serious,  this  is  a  risk 
known to healthcare professionals and can be managed with early diagnosis 
with supportive treatment. Most observed cases have been of mild severity, 
and spontaneously resolved. 
Important identified risk 
Pericarditis 
Potential mechanisms 
Acute pericarditis is an inflammatory process involving the pericardium that 
results  in  a  clinical  syndrome  characterized  by  chest  pain,  pericardial 
friction  rub,  changes  in  the  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  and  occasionally,  a 
pericardial effusion. Generally, the diagnosis requires 2 of these 4 features. 
Epidemiologic data on the incidence of acute pericarditis are lacking, likely 
because  this  condition  is  frequently  inapparent  clinically,  despite  its 
presence in numerous disorders (Imazio 2015). However, it appears to be 
the most common form of pericardial disease and a relatively common cause 
of chest pain. It is diagnosed in approximately 0.1% of patients hospitalized 
for chest pain and in 5% of patients admitted to the emergency department 
for chest pain unrelated to acute myocardial infarction (MI). Although acute 
pericarditis occurs in all age groups and in men and women, it presents most 
often  in  men  20  to  50  years  of  age.  The  most  common  form  of  acute 
pericarditis  is  idiopathic,  which  accounts  for  about  90%  of  cases.  Other 
common causes include infection, renal failure, myocardial infarction (MI), 
post-cardiac  injury  syndrome,  malignancy,  radiation,  and  trauma.  Acute 
pericarditis is more common in men than in women. However, although this 
condition is more common in adults than in children, adolescents are more 
commonly affected than young adults. 
Evidence  source(s)  and  strength  of 
evidence 
Data to evaluate the safety concern were derived from the clinical trials and 
post-authorisation safety data. 
Characterization of risk 
In study mRNA-1273-P301 (Part A), in the safety set, there were 15,184 
participants exposed to the elasomeran vaccine, and 15,166 participants in 
the  placebo  arm.  There  were  four  TEAE  of  “Pericarditis”  in  P301:  Two 
TEAEs in the Placebo arm, and two in the Vaccine arm of the safety set in 
the overall stage after any injection. The 2 events in the placebo arm were 
reported in the >18 to <65 years of age. The events in the vaccination arm 
were reported in a male in his 60s’ and a female in her 50s’. In Part B, one 
case  of  acute  pericarditis  (verbatim:  “acute  infective  pericarditis”)  was 
reported in a male in his 60s’ in the placebo group; the event occurred 24 
days  after  a  COVID‑19  diagnosis.  In  addition,  one  case  of  pericardial 
effusion was reported as an SAE (resolving) in a 20s’ years old male in the 
placebo–elasomeran  group.  No  participant  in  the  elasomeran  group 
experienced pericarditis (CSR mRNA-1273-P301 addendum 1 (Safety from

Preventability 
Pericarditis 
A  review  of  the  spontaneous  reports  from  the  company’s  global  safety 
identified  68  case  reports  with  the  PTs  of  Pericarditis.  All  of  the 
aforementioned  reports  were  considered  serious  reports.  As  a  difference 
with  the  Myocarditis  reports,  most  of  the  Pericarditis  reports  (64.7%) 
involved persons >50 years of age. There was not an important difference 
between the reported genders, with 51% Males, and 47% females.  There 
was not an important difference in the TTO for the pericarditis cases with 
16% reporting a TTO less than 1 day, 18 % for each 2 to 3 days and 4 to 7 
days.  The  majority  of  the  reports  reported  a  TTO  of  more  than  8  days 
following last vaccination. Occurrence following dose 1 was very similar 
(37% of reports) to the one seeing following dose 2 (41%). Dose number 
was not reported in 22% of the cases.   
Evaluation of all the 68 cases identified as cases of Pericarditis, utilizing the 
WHO-UMC causality assessment, there were 18 reports that were classified 
as “Possible” according to the WHO-UMC causality assessment. Of these 
“Possible”  18  cases,  there  were  9  males  and  9  females.  Their  ages  were 
between 28 and 82 years of age (Median= 51.5). 8 reports were after the 1st 
dose, 9 after the 2nd dose of the elasomeran vaccine, and 1 did not provided 
dose information. The reported TTO was between 1 days and 23 days (Mean 
11.3  days).  The  rest  of  the  68  cases  that  reported  Pericarditis,  11  cases 
(16.2%) were classified as “Conditional”; 21 cases (30.8%) were classified 
as  “Unassessable/  Unclassifiable”;  and  18  (26.5%)  were  classified  as 
“Unlikely”. 
The post-marketing reporting rate for pericarditis (without myocarditis) was 
2.16  per  100,000  person-years  based  on  a  21-day  risk  window  following 
each dose of vaccine administered. 
Acute  pericarditis  occurs  when  the  bilayer  pericardial  sac  becomes 
inflamed. In most cases, the cause of pericarditis is idiopathic or is assumed 
to be due to a viral infection for which the antecedent virus is not identified. 
There  are  several  less  common  infectious  and  non-infectious  causes  of 
pericarditis, but most patients with acute pericarditis present with a history 
suggestive of recent or concurrent viral illness. Most cases resolve with no 
long-term sequelae. While pericardial effusions might develop as a result of 
pericarditis, they are usually minor and rarely result in cardiac tamponade 
(Sharif 2013). 
Acute  pericarditis  is  more  common  in  men  than  in  women.  However, 
although  this  condition  is  more  common  in  adults  than  in  children, 
adolescents are more commonly affected than young adults. 
A prospective clinical cohort study in Italy identified an incidence of 27.7 
cases  per  100,000  person-years  (Imazio  2008).  Another  study,  a 
retrospective analysis of Finnish registry data capturing admissions to 29 
hospitals over a span of 9.5 years identified an age standardized incidence 
of 3.32 per 100,000 person-years, with higher rates in men ages 16-65 (Kytö 
2014). 
Pericarditis is the most common pericardial disorder. Congenital pericardial 
disorders are rare. 
Pericarditis may be caused by many disorders (e.g., infection, myocardial 
infarction,  trauma,  tumors,  metabolic  disorders)  but  is  often  idiopathic. 
Symptoms  include  chest  pain  or  tightness,  often  worsened  by  deep 
breathing. Cardiac output may be greatly reduced if cardiac tamponade or 
constrictive  pericarditis  develops.  Diagnosis  is  based  on  symptoms,  a

accumulation on x-ray or echocardiogram (Hoit 2020). 
Pericarditis  may  result  in  one  of  two  serious  complications:  cardiac 
tamponade  and  chronic  constrictive  pericarditis.  Cardiac  tamponade  is 
considered a medical emergency and, if left untreated, can quickly become 
fatal. 
Very  rare  cases  of  myocarditis  and  pericarditis  have  been  observed 
following vaccination with Spikevax. These cases have primarily occurred 
within  14  days  following  vaccination,  more  often  after  the  second 
vaccination, and more often in younger men. Available data suggest that the 
course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different 
from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.  
Healthcare  professionals  should  be  alert  to  the  signs  and  symptoms  of 
myocarditis  and  pericarditis.  Vaccinees  should  be  instructed  to  seek 
immediate  medical  attention  if  they  develop  symptoms  indicative  of 
myocarditis  or  pericarditis  such  as  (acute  and  persisting)  chest  pain, 
shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare  professionals  should  consult  guidance  and/or  specialists  to 
diagnose and treat this condition. 
CDC  recommends  deferring  the  2nd  dose  of  mRNA  COVID-19  vaccine 
until  more  information  is  known.  However,  if  heart has  recovered,  could 
consider proceeding with 2nd dose (Wallace 2021). 
Based on the analysis of all the safety data, it shows that there have been 
very rare reports of pericarditis occurring after vaccination with Moderna 
COVID-19 Vaccine. Although causality cannot be established at this time, 
the majority of the cases have been reported in young males, and shortly 
after  the  second  dose  of  the  vaccine.  These  are  typically  mild  cases  and 
individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment 
and rest. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms 
of  pericarditis.  The  benefits  (prevention  of  COVID-19  disease  and 
associated  hospitalizations,  ICU  admissions,  and  deaths)  outweighed  the 
risks (expected myocarditis cases after vaccination) in all populations for 
which vaccination has been recommended. 
Pericarditis  associated  with  vaccines  typically  occur  at  a  low  incidence, 
which results in a low public health impact. Although the potential clinical 
consequences  of  the  occurrence  of  pericarditis  are  serious,  this  is  a  risk 
known to healthcare professionals.

III.1 
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities  
The MAH has an established signal management process including signal detection, validation 
and evaluation of spontaneous reports from all sources. During signal detection data sources are 
screened for new safety information related to Spikevax. Following initial review of the available 
data, a determination is made on the basis of the nature and the quality of the new information 
whether  further  investigation  is  warranted,  at  which  point  those  topics  referred  for  further 
investigation are considered “validated  signals”. Potential  signal  detection data sources  include 
safety data from MAH-sponsored clinical trials and clinical as well as non-interventional studies, 
spontaneous  AE  reports,  published  literature,  and  communications  from  external  sources, 
including regulatory agencies, and (if applicable) business partners. Moderna’s PV system relies 
primarily on AEs contained in its global PV database (Argus platform) that captures suspected AE 
reports and in addition, signal from regulatory databases (eg Eudravigilance, VAERS). Routine 
PV also includes a periodic review of  the literature that involves targeted keyword searches in 
widely recognised databases (i.e., MEDLINE, EMBASE). Moderna performs a weekly aggregate 
quantitative  signal  detection  review  of  the  global  safety  database  in  order  to  identify  possible 
adverse reactions. Moderna also conducts monthly safety reports that are shared with regulatory 
agencies worldwide. 
Routine  Pharmacovigilance  Activities  Beyond  Adverse  Reactions  Reporting  and  Signal 
Detection: 
Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for Spikevax 
Myocarditis / Pericarditis Questionnaire 
The  questionnaire  is  intended  to  collect  structured  information  on  cases  of  myocarditis  and 
pericarditis. It is intended to assist with capturing information that can support case classification 
using the Myocarditis Brighton Collaboration case definition (Brighton  Collaboration 2021) as 
well  as  the  CDC  working  case  definitions  on  Acute  Myocarditis  (Gargano  2021)  and  Acute 
Pericarditis (Gargano 2021). 
Signal Detection 
The  Moderna  signal  management  process  for  Spikevax  includes  signal  detection,  validation, 
prioritization, evaluation, and recommendation for actions as well as documentation and tracking 
of signals. It follows the principles of the Good Pharmacovigilance Practices Module IX for Signal

Product  surveillance  to  identify  safety  signals  will  occur  for  any  reported  AEs  including 
reactogenicity. Safety surveillance prioritization is for the safety concerns of the RMP, AESIs, or 
those AEs that may be serious or known to be often medicine related. 
If any cluster of events is detected which points towards an unexpected event/syndrome, Moderna 
will  perform  appropriate  signal  evaluation  and  will  provide  this  information  to  the  appropriate 
regulatory agencies.

As enhanced pharmacovigilance activities and to further support signal detection, observed rates 
of  AEs  will  be  compared  with  the  expected  rates  which  will  be  available  from  the  scientific 
literature  or  other  sources  including  those  reported  by  the  EMA-funded  COVID-19  vaccine 
monitoring ACCESS program (Dodd 2020). Specifically, Moderna will use the AESIs agreed with 
the EMA to compare their observed reporting rates during the time period of the vaccination with 
Spikevax  to  the  published  expected  incidence  rates  resulting  from  the  ACCESS  retrospective 
multi-database  dynamic  cohort  study,  conducted  during  the  years  2017  to  2020,  including  the 
period of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Europe.  
During the evaluation of validated signals, Moderna will have access to a large US population of 
de-identified  patient  level  information  in  healthcare  claims  databases  to  conduct  additional 
Observed to Expected (O/E) analyses in defined cohorts as well as to potentially launch inferential 
epidemiologic studies to evaluate these safety signals in a rapid manner. This database, used in 
support of US PASS protocol mRNA-1273-P903, became available for signal assessment Q32021. 
Reporting to EMA 
Valid  ICSRs  that fulfil the  local  regulatory  requirements  for  submission to the EudraVigilance 
database  will  be  submitted  within  the  15-  or  90-day  time  frame.  This  includes  any  COVID-19 
cases  requiring  hospitalisation,  vaccination  administration  errors,  and  MIS  that  may  have  been 
reported to occur in vaccinees.

Potential Medication Errors 
Large scale mass vaccination may potentially introduce the risk of medication errors related to 
storage,  handling,  dosing,  and  administration  errors  associated  with  a  multidose  vial,  and 
confusion with other COVID-19 vaccines. These potential medication errors are mitigated through 
the information in the SmPC. 
Traceability 
The SmPC includes instructions for healthcare professionals to record the name and batch number 
of the administered vaccine to improve traceability.  
The  vaccine  carton  labelling  also  contains  a  scannable  2D  barcode  that  provides  the  batch/lot 
number  and  expiry  date.  In  addition,  Moderna  also  provides  stickers  (two  stickers  per  dose, 
containing printed batch/lot information, product identification, and 2D bar code that encodes a 
unique identifier [serial number]) either in cartons or to be shipped along with each shipment, in 
the countries where this is required. 
III.2 
Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities  
In addition to actions targeted at identified and potential risks described in the safety specifications, 
the MAH intends to address general safety through continued clinical trial follow-up, a European 
Post  Authorisation  Safety  Study,  an  observational  study  of  Spikevax  using  routinely  collected 
health data in 5 European countries, which monitors safety of Spikevax in pregnancy, a US Post 
Authorization  safety  study,  and  an  observational  study  to  assess  maternal  and  infant  outcomes 
following exposure to Spikevax during pregnancy, collecting data in the US. 
The immunogenicity and safety of mRNA vaccine boosters for SARS-CoV-2 variants, including

safety signals. The 
study has 3 core 
objectives: 
-Estimation of

for AESI and other 
outcomes in the 
cohort  
-Assessment of 
observed versus 
expected rates  
-Self-controlled 
risk interval 
analyses for 
adverse events that 
meet specific 
threshold criteria 
The overarching 
research question 
of this study: Is the 
occurrence of each 
adverse event of 
special interest 
(AESI) among 
persons vaccinated 
with Spikevax in 
Europe higher than 
the occurrence of 
that AESI that 
would have been 
expected in the 
same population in 
the absence of 
Spikevax? 
Primary objective: 
- To assess whether 
vaccination with 
Spikevax (by dose 
number where 
feasible and for any 
dose) is associated 
with increased 
rates of the AESI 
compared with the 
expected rates 
overall and 
stratified by 
country, sex, and 
age group.

Study status: Ongoing 
Summary of Objectives 
(AESI) among persons 
vaccinated with Spikevax in 
Europe higher than the 
occurrence of that AESI that 
would have been expected in 
the same population in the 
absence of Spikevax? 
Primary objective: 
- To assess whether 
vaccination with Spikevax (by 
dose number where feasible 
and for any dose) is associated 
with increased rates of the 
AESI compared with the 
expected rates overall and 
stratified by country, sex, and 
age group. 
Secondary objective: 
- To assess whether 
vaccination with Spikevax is 
associated with increased rates 
of the AESI compared with 
the expected rates in 
subpopulations of interest: 
women of childbearing age, 
patients who are 
immunocompromised, 
patients previously diagnosed 
with COVID-19 infection, 
patients with unstable health 
conditions and comorbidities, 
and patients with autoimmune 
or inflammatory disorders 
The overarching research 
question is: is there a greater 
risk or prevalence of 
pregnancy complications, 
adverse pregnancy outcomes, 
or adverse neonatal outcomes 
following pregnancies 
exposed to Spikevax 
compared with pregnancies 
unexposed to Spikevax? 
Primary objectives: 
- To determine whether

I 
The Medicine and What it is Used for 
Spikevax is authorised for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 
individuals 6 months of age and older. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is authorised for 
active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 6 years of age 
and older who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19. 
Spikevax  bivalent  Original/Omicron  BA.4-5  is  authorised  for  active  immunisation  to  prevent 
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals 6 months of age and older. 
The active substance in Spikevax is mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein embedded 
in lipid nanoparticles (elasomeran) and it is given by intramuscular route. The active substances in 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 are mRNA encoding the original SARS-CoV-2 Spike 
protein  embedded  in  lipid  nanoparticles  (elasomeran)  and  mRNA  encoding  the  SARS-CoV-2 
Spike protein  of the Omicron variant embedded  in  lipid  nanoparticles (imelasomeran)  and it is 
given by intramuscular route. The active substances in Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-
5 are mRNA encoding the original SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein embedded in lipid nanoparticles 
(elasomeran)  and  mRNA  encoding  the  SARS-CoV-2  Spike  protein  of  the  Omicron  variant 
embedded in lipid nanoparticles (davesomeran) and it is given by intramuscular route. 
Further information about the evaluation of Spikevax, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1, 
and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 benefits can be found in the Spikevax EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA)

Risks  Associated  With  the  Medicine  and  Activities  to  Minimise  or  Further 
II 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Spikevax, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1, and Spikevax  bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for  learning  more  about  Spikevax,  Spikevax  bivalent  Original/Omicron  BA.1,  and  Spikevax 
bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the  package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The  authorised  pack  size  —  the  amount  of  medicine  in  a  pack  is  chosen  so  to  ensure  that  the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  Adverse  Reactions  (ARs)  is  collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment, 
so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken,  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. If important information that may affect the safe use of Spikevax, 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1, and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is not 
yet available, it is listed under “missing information” below. 
In  the  case  of  Spikevax,  Spikevax  bivalent  Original/Omicron  BA.1,  and  Spikevax  bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5, these measures are supplemented with additional pharmacovigilance 
activities mentioned under the relevant important risks below. 
II.A  List of Important Risks and Missing Information  
Important risks of Spikevax, Spikevax bivalent  Original/Omicron BA.1, and Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron  BA.4-5  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Spikevax, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.1, and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Approximately 1% to 5% of patients that test positive for acute viral infection(s) 
may  exhibit  a  form  of  myocarditis.  The  annual  prevalence  of  myocarditis  has 
been  reported  from  10.2  to  105.6  per  100,000  worldwide,  and  its  annual 
occurrence is estimated at about 1.8 million cases. 
Most studies of acute myocarditis report a greater prevalence and severity in male 
patients,  speculated  to  be  caused  by  a  protective  effect  of  natural  hormonal 
influences on immune responses in women when compared with men. Patients 
are  usually  between  the  ages  of  20  and  50.  Acute  myocarditis  and 
hyperthyroidism are also common diseases that often present in young, otherwise 
healthy patients.  
The spontaneous reports included in the global safety database included 4 cases 
that reported previous COVID-19 infection (5.9%) with these reports in the 18 to 
39 years of age group. There were 5 reports of previous Myocarditis/ Pericarditis 
medical history (5.9%), 14 reports of cardiovascular conditions (16.5%), 5 with 
Thyroid  conditions  (5.9%),  and  12  (14.1%)  had  previous  medical  histories  of 
allergy-type conditions including history of anaphylaxis.

Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis 
and  pericarditis.  Vaccinees  should  be  instructed  to  seek  immediate  medical 
attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such 
as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following 
vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists 
to diagnose and treat this condition. (SmPC Section 4.4). 
Following  vaccination,  you  should  be  alert  to  signs  of  myocarditis  and

Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Data to evaluate the safety concern were derived from the clinical trials and post-
authorisation safety data. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In most cases, the cause of pericarditis is idiopathic or is assumed to be due to a 
viral  infection.  There  are  several  less  common  infectious  and  non-infectious 
causes  of  pericarditis,  but  most  patients  with  acute  pericarditis  present  with  a 
history suggestive of recent or concurrent viral illness. Most cases resolve with 
no long-term sequelae. While pericardial effusions might develop as a result of 
pericarditis, they are usually minor and rarely result in cardiac tamponade. 
Acute pericarditis is more common in men than in women. However, although 
this condition is more common in adults than in children, adolescents are more 
commonly affected than young adults. 
A prospective clinical cohort study in Italy identified an incidence of 27.7 cases 
per  100,000  person-years.  Another  study,  a  retrospective  analysis  of  Finnish 
registry  data  capturing  admissions  to  29  hospitals  over  a  span  of  9.5  years 
identified an age standardized incidence of 3.32 per 100,000 person-years, with 
higher rates in men ages 16-65. 
Pericarditis  is  the  most  common  pericardial  disorder.  Congenital  pericardial 
disorders are rare.

study 
Enhanced  pharmacovigilance 
to  provide 
additional  evaluation  of  AESI  (including  myocarditis 
and pericarditis) and emerging validated safety signals. 
The study has 3 core objectives: 
-Estimation  of  background  rates  for  AESI  and  other 
outcomes in the cohort  
-Assessment of observed versus expected rates  
-Self-controlled risk interval analyses for adverse events 
that meet specific threshold criteria. 
The overarching research question of this study: Is the 
occurrence  of  each  adverse  event  of  special  interest 
(AESI)  among  persons  vaccinated  with  Spikevax  in 
Europe  higher  than  the  occurrence  of  that  AESI  that 
would have been expected in the same population in the 
absence of Spikevax? 
The overarching research question is: is there a greater 
risk or prevalence of pregnancy complications, adverse 
pregnancy  outcomes,  or  adverse  neonatal  outcomes 
following  pregnancies  exposed  to  Spikevax  compared 
with pregnancies unexposed to Spikevax? 
Evaluate  the  vaccine  effectiveness  (VE)  of  Moderna 
COVID-19 vaccine in preventing COVID-19 diagnosis 
(symptomatic and asymptomatic) and severe COVID-19 
disease  (hospitalizations  and  mortality)  in  a  large 
integrated healthcare system in the United States.  
Describe the clinical course, outcomes and risk factors 
for  myocarditis  and  pericarditis  associated  with 
Moderna vaccination targeting SARS-CoV-2. 
The  overarching  goal  of  this  study  is  to  characterize 
temporally 
long-term  outcomes  of  myocarditis 
associated  with 
elasomeran 
of 
administration 
(SPIKEVAX)  and  Moderna  COVID-19  Vaccine, 
Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5). 
An  observational  study  to  assess  maternal  and  infant 
outcomes  following  exposure  to  Spikevax  during 
pregnancy 
This  observational  post-marketing  safety  study  will 
evaluate the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, birth 
outcomes,  infant  outcomes,  or  early  life  infections

Study Title and Number 
(mRNA-1273-P919) 
Purpose of the Study 
following  maternal  exposure 
pregnancy 
to  Spikevax  during 
Post-marketing safety of Moderna Omicron-containing 
bivalent SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 booster vaccines in 
the United States 
(mRNA-1273-P920) 
The overarching aim of this study is to characterize the 
safety of the Omicron-containing bivalent SARS-CoV-2 
mRNA-1273 booster vaccine as used in routine clinical 
practice. 
An Open-Label, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Safety 
and  Immunogenicity  of  the  mRNA-1273.214  Vaccine 
for  SARS-CoV-2  Variants  of  Concern  in  Participants 
Aged 6 Months to < 6 Years 
(mRNA-1273-P306)  
Evaluate  the  safety  and reactogenicity of 25  μg  of  the 
mRNA-1273.214  vaccine  administered  as  2-dose 
primary  series  28  days  apart  in  participants  aged  6 
months to < 6 years. 
Evaluate  the  safety  and reactogenicity of 10  μg  of  the 
mRNA-1273.214  vaccine  administered  as  a  single 
booster  dose  (BD)  at  least  4  months  post-Dose  2  in 
participants  aged  6  months  to  <  6  years,  who  have 
previously received mRNA-1273 as a primary series

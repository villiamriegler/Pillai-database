2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is seeking marketing authorization for: 
Columvi is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
DLBCL is the most common NHL diagnosed in Western Europe and the United States, accounting for 
approximately 30-58% of NHL cases (Tilly et al. 2015). The disease causes approximately 8500 new 
cases in Europe (Sant et al. 2010) and an estimated 4000 deaths per year (Marcos-Gragera et al. 
2011, De Angelis et al. 2015, Howlader et al. 2016). Throughout the world, the incidence increases 
with age; for example, in the United States, rates rise from 0.3/100,000/year (in patients that are 
0−19 years old) to 4.6/100,000/year (20−64 years) and to 33.5/100,000/year (ages 65+).  
A family history of lymphoma, autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) seropositivity, a high body mass as a young adult and some occupational 
exposures have been identified as risk factors of DLBCL (Morton el al. 2014).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma represents a biologically and clinically heterogeneous group of 
lymphoproliferative malignancies which in 90% of cases are derived from B-cells. As in the majority of 
other mature B-cell lymphomas, DLBCL is characterized by the expression of a surface membrane 
antigen, CD20. CD20 is an attractive target for anti-lymphoma therapies, being B-cell-specific, highly 
and stably expressed, exhibiting a low rate of internalization, and not being present on hematopoietic 
stem cells. The concept of targeting CD20 as an effective anti-lymphoma strategy has been validated 
by clinical data for the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (R), showing prolonged survival in 
DLBCL when added to intensive cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens (Sehn et al. 2015).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 9/158 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
 DLBCL is a life-threatening disease with an aggressive natural history and is fatal if left untreated. The 
incidence of DLBCL increases with age, with a median age of 64 years at diagnosis. Patients typically 
present with rapidly enlarging masses at nodal or extranodal sites and 45-60% of patients present with 
advanced-stage disease (Ann Arbor Stage III or IV). The clinical course can be debilitating due to 
constitutional symptoms, local symptoms of lymphadenopathy and bone marrow failure that may lead 
to infections, anemia, thrombocytopenia, organ failure, and death. Relapses of DLBCL are 
characterized by increasing refractoriness and decreasing duration of response to subsequent lines of 
therapy. 
The current standard of care for first-line treatment for DLBCL is nowadays difficult to define in the EU. 
CHOP in combination with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab (R-CHOP) (Coiffier et al. 
2010) has been the standard of care for almost three decades, which is still reflected e.g. in the ESMO 
and NCCN guidelines. The reason for this is, that ESMO guidelines have been published prior to the 
approval of Polatuzumab vedotin in the 1L setting and the approval status in the US still does not 
contain this 1L indication (Polivy USPI, access date 17.08.2022).  
According to consulted experts, the up-to-date trend could be to treat patients with the Pola+R-CHP in 
1L and this could possibly be considered a new standard of care despite it not being reflected in the 
ESMO or NCCN guidelines. If there is indeed a shift to Pola-R-CHP in 1L, this change in treatment 
paradigm could be used by the applicant to additionally justify the MTA, as for patients pre-treated 
with Pola in the first line, there might be less willingness in the real-life setting to retreat them with 
Pola+BR in subsequent lines.  
Despite significant therapeutic progress with the use of immunochemotherapy as first-line treatment 
for DLBCL, many patients will eventually relapse. For patients who are not cured with first-line (1L) 
therapy, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) offers a 
second chance for cure (Philip et al. 1995; NCCN 2021; Tilly et al. 2015). However, this is only 
available for younger, fit patients who demonstrate chemosensitive disease (Tilly et al. 2015). Less 
than half of patients who are eligible for transplant will be cured (Seyfarth et al. 2006; Gisselbrecht et 
al. 2010). Patients with primary refractory disease or who relapse after transplant fare particularly 
poorly (Rochewski et al. 2022). 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (NCCN 2021) and European Society for 
Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines (Tilly et al. 2015) suggest that patients who relapse after second-
line therapy are unlikely to respond to subsequent therapy and therefore generally are not eligible for 
ASCT. The outcome in patients not eligible for ASCT is dismal with generally no chance of prolonged 
periods of disease control (Thieblemont and Coiffier, 2007). Poor outcomes have been reported for 
patients with R/R DLBCL who respond to salvage therapy, but are ineligible for transplant based on one 
or more factors, such as age > 65 years, inadequate response or early relapse after salvage therapy, 
relapse after second or greater line of therapy, failure to mobilize stem cells for ASCT, or presence of 
comorbidities or unresolved toxicities. In these patients, overall survival (OS) rates were 4-13 months 
(Colosia et al. 2014; Feugier et al. 2005; Crump et al. 2004; Sehn et al. 2020). 
Published analyses of large-scale outcome data from patients with refractory DLBCL are limited. 
Refractory patients receiving second- or third-line with chemotherapy obtain an objective response 
rate of around 20-30% with short progression-free survival (PFS) (Gisselbrecht et al. 2018; Crump et 
al. 2017; Maurer et al. 2015; Telio et al. 2012). 
Taken together, there remains an unmet medical need for patients with R/R DLBCL and the availability 
of new treatment options that can extend the duration of remission and overcome resistance to 
existing therapies, while providing acceptable safety and tolerability.

EMA/228393/2023  
Page 10/158 
 
 
 
2.1.5.  Management 
Patients with R/R DLBCL who are not candidates for stem cell transplant, or who choose not to have a 
stem cell transplant, may be treated with chemotherapies such as bendamustine or gemcitabine. See 
ESMO recommendation (Table 1/ESMO GL, below). 
However, none of these agents or regimens are specifically indicated for patients with DLBCL. In a 
large, international, retrospective study evaluating the outcomes in patients with refractory DLBCL 
(SCHOLAR-1), an overall response rate (ORR) of 26%, a CR rate of 7%, and a median OS of 6.3 
months with existing therapies was reported among patients who were resistant to chemotherapy or 
who had a relapse within 12 months after ASCT (Crump et al. 2017). 
Platinum containing regimens such as R-ICE, R-DHAP, and R-GDP were evaluated in clinical trials 
focused on transplant-eligible patients as salvage regimens (Gisselbrecht et al. 2010; Crump et al. 
2014). These regimens may be considered in transplant-ineligible patients in clinical practice as the 
studies were designed to evaluate the salvage regimens followed by high-dose chemotherapy (HDT)-
ASCT; however, these regimens may not be generalizable for most transplant-ineligible patients, as 
the reasons for ineligibility are typically advanced age, comorbidities, or frailty.  
Gemcitabine/platinum-based therapies are also an option for patients with R/R DLBCL (Mounier et al 
2013, Cazelles et al 2021).  
Bendamustine is widely used in combination with rituximab (BR) in EU clinical practice for the 
treatment of patients with R/R DLBCL.  
Three CAR-Ts (Yescarta, Kymriah and Breyanzi) are approved in the EU for patients with R/R DLBCL 
who have received two or more lines of systemic therapy (Kochenderfer et al. 2015, Pegram et al. 
2015). However, despite the promising CAR-T data, ensuring the consistency, quality, and dose of 
autologous cell-based therapies remain challenging, the treatment is also restricted to specialized 
centers, as well as there may be logistical issues, making it difficult to treat patients who require rapid 
disease control (Thieblemont et al. 2019, Nastoupil et al. 2018).  
Another approved option is Pixantrone (Pixuvri) as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients 
with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL.   
Recently Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin), a CD79b-directed antibody-drug conjugate received conditional 
approval in the EU, in combination with bendamustine and rituximab for the treatment of adult 
patients with R/R DLBCL who are not candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Polivy is now 
fully approved as the conditions for the CMA have been fulfilled.  
Minjuvi (tafasitamab) received a conditional approval in combination with lenalidomide followed by 
Minjuvi monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL who are not eligible for ASCT.   
Achieving a response to therapy (CR rate) remains highly prognostic for the overall outcome (PFS and 
OS) of patients with R/R DLBCL (Lee et al, 2011). Available therapies have limitations and generally, 
OS is short. Taken together, this highlights the unmet medical need and the need to improve further 
treatment outcomes in these patients to extend the duration of remission and overcome resistance to 
existing therapies, while providing acceptable safety and tolerability. 
2.2.  About the product 
Glofitamab (also known as RO7082859, RG6026, CD20 CD3, CD20 CD3 TCB, CD20 TCB, or CD20-TCB) 
is a full-length, fully humanized, immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody (TCB). 
As a TCB targeting CD20-expressing B cells, glofitamab binds to CD20 expressed on target B cells and

CD3 epsilon chain (CD3ε) present on effector T cells. By simultaneously binding to human CD20-
expressing tumor cells and to the CD3ε of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex on T cells, it induces 
tumor cell lysis, in addition to T-cell activation, proliferation and cytokine release. Nonclinical studies 
conducted with glofitamab have demonstrated that it is a potent molecule with proven in vitro and in 
vivo activity to completely eliminate B-cells from the peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs, 
and to induce regression of aggressive lymphoma tumors. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on considerations of the draw 
backs of a SAT and the availability of several other treatment options with comparable response rates, 
however, it was acknowledged that Glofitamab has a novel MoA and addresses a high unmet need in a 
population of RR DLBCL with varying comorbidities; moreover the initial results from a Phase I/II single 
arm trial (SAT) are encouraging from a clinical point of view.  
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. To confirm the clinical 
benefit and convert the CMA to a standard marketing authorisation (MA), the applicant proposes 
to submit Study GO41944, a Phase III open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 
patients with R/R DLBCL.  Approximately 270 eligible patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive either Glofitamab-Gemcitabine-Oxaliplatin (Glofit-GemOx) or Rituximab-Gemcitabine-
Oxaliplatin (R-GemOx).  The primary endpoint is OS.  The secondary endpoints in this study are 
PFS, CR rate, ORR, DOR, DOCR, time to deterioration in physical functioning and/or fatigue, and 
time to deterioration in lymphoma-specific symptoms.  Prior CHMP scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/4023/2/2019/III), considered that a randomized controlled trial in an earlier 
treatment line may be considered an appropriate specific obligation 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as Glofitamab is a novel bispecific antibody with a new 
mechanism of action for R/R DLBCL patients, redirecting T-cells against the cancer cells.  
Glofitamab monotherapy met the primary endpoint of CRR by IRC assessment in NP30179 Cohort 
D3 in a high unmet need population; a population of heavily pre-treated high-risk patients with 
R/R DLBCL who have received at least two prior systemic therapies and are refractory to multiple 
classes of prior therapy (including refractory to CAR-T).  The CRR and durability were clinically 
meaningful compared to available therapies in the enrolled populations, and there was a favorable 
and well tolerated safety profile, supporting a positive benefit risk profile for glofitamab 
monotherapy in this population.  In addition to its positive benefit-risk, glofitamab monotherapy is 
a readily available (‘off-the-shelf’) chemotherapy-free regimen with a fixed duration of treatment 
length to treat R/R DLBCL patients with ≥2 prior therapies. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
Based on the aggressiveness of, and poor prognosis associated with, R/R DLBCL as well as the 
fact that the risk-benefit balance of Columvi is positive, the benefits to public health of immediate 
availability outweigh the risks.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Glofitamab is a novel T cell bispecific humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to human CD20 on 
tumor cells and to the human CD3 epsilon subunit (CD3ε) of the T-cell receptor complex on T cells.  
Glofitamab is produced in CHO cells based on a human IgG1 framework.  Two Fab domains bind to 
CD20 and one Fab domain binds to CD3ε. The antibody consists of two different heavy chains and two 
different light chains. The Fc region of glofitamab bears a proprietary modification, which abrogates its 
binding to Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) and prevents FcγR-mediated co-activation of innate immune 
effector cells including natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils without changes in 
functional binding to FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor). 
Columvi finished product is provided as a sterile liquid concentrate for solution for intravenous infusion. 
The finished product is composed of 1 mg/mL glofitamab in L-histidine/L-histidine hydrochloride buffer, 
D-sucrose, L-methionine, polysorbate 20, pH 5.5. 
The finished product is available in two strengths provided in two vial configurations: 2.5 
mg/2.5mLfilled in a 6 mL single-use glass vial and 10 mg/10mL filled in a 15 mL single-use glass vial.  
2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General Information 
Glofitamab (INN) is a [2+1] or 2:1 bispecific humanised monoclonal antibody produced in CHO cells 
based on a human IgG1 framework. Two Fab domains bind to CD20 and contain heavy chain VH1 and 
light chain VLkappa2 subgroup sequences. One Fab domain binds to CD3ε and contains heavy chain 
VH3 and light chain VLlambda7 subgroup sequences. Glofitamab consists of two different heavy chains 
and two different light chains, composed of LC1, 2 times LC2, HC1, and HC2. 
Point mutations in the CH3 domain (“Knobs into holes”) promote the assembly of two different heavy 
chains. Exchange of the VH and VL domains in the CD3 binding Fab (CrossMab approach) and point 
mutations in the CH and CL domains (“charged variants”) in the CD20 binding Fabs promote the correct 
assembly of the two different light chains. The “Knobs into holes” mutations consist of amino acid 
exchanges Y351C, T368S, L370A, and Y409V in the heavy chain HC1 and of amino acid exchanges 
S581C and T593W in the heavy chain HC2. The “charged variants” mutations consist of amino acid 
exchanges E128R and Q129K in the light chain LC2 and amino acid exchanges K149E and K215E in the 
heavy chains HC1 and HC2. The Fc region bears a proprietary modification (“PG LALA” mutation), 
which abrogates its binding to Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) and to the first protein component (C1q) of 
the complement cascade. Thereby, FcγR-mediated effector functions, including co-activation of innate 
immune effector cells like natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils are 
prevented, without changes in functional binding to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The “PG LALA” 
mutations consist of amino acid exchanges P331G, L236A, and L237A in the heavy chain HC1 and 
amino acid exchanges P556G, L461A, and L462A in the heavy chain HC2. 
The molecular mass of intact glofitamab is approximately 194 kDa. 
2.4.2.2.   Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturing process and process controls 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 13/158 
 
 
 
The glofitamab active substance is manufactured at Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Nonnenwald 2, 82377, 
Penzberg, Germany. Sufficient proof of GMP compliance has been provided for all sites involved in the 
active substance manufacturing and/or control. 
Glofitamab is manufactured using an upstream process resembling a standard process for monoclonal 
antibody manufacturing based on fed-batch culturing of cell lines. The production bioreactor content is 
harvested by centrifugation and filtration to remove cells and cell debris prior to further purification. 
 Glofitamab is purified and final conditioned using a combination of chromatography and filtration steps 
and additional steps for removal and inactivation of potential viral contaminants prior to filling into the 
container closure system. 
Control of materials 
Apart from the production cells, no raw material of animal or human origin is used for the manufacture 
of glofitamab active substance.  
Preparation of master cell bank (MCB) and WCB is described in sufficient detail.  
Overall, the generation and characterisation of the MCB, WCB and cells at an in vitro age comply with 
the requirements set in the ICH Q5A, Q5B and Q5D guidelines.  
Process characterisation and validation 
The process was developed using a quality by design strategy combining science- and risk-based 
approaches. This includes glofitamab-specific studies as well as prior knowledge gained from similar 
molecules and processes. Process validation studies were conducted both at the commercial 
manufacturing site and scale and in qualified scale-down models (SDMs). 
The glofitamab active substance manufacturing process has been validated in accordance with relevant 
guidelines and the control strategy is acceptable. 
Manufacturing process performance qualification (PPQ) 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) and non-CPPs were monitored in the PPQ batches to demonstrate 
that the active substance manufacturing process could be executed within the established process 
parameter acceptable ranges. Critical quality attributes (CQAs), IPCs and key performance indicators 
(KPIs) were also evaluated.  
Overall, the presented PPQ data demonstrate that the manufacturing process provides a product that 
consistently meets its predefined quality attributes at the commercial manufacturing site and scale and 
that the process performs as designed. The process is therefore considered as validated at the 
commercial manufacturing site and scale.  
Process parameter ranges and CPPs 
A risk ranking and filtering (RRF) assessment was conducted for each unit operation to assess the 
criticality of all process parameters based on relevant prior knowledge and product-specific 
development data. A process parameter was identified as critical if it had an impact on any CQA or KPI. 
Acceptable ranges for CPPs were then established based on manufacturing-scale data or existing 
process validation data. Alternatively, a process parameter would be further investigated in a process 
validation study to assess its criticality and to validate its acceptable range. If no impact on any CQA or 
KPI has been observed or is expected, this process parameter was directly classified as a non-CPP and 
an acceptable range was established based on the RRF or product-specific development data. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 14/158 
 
 
 
 
 
Process characterisation studies were multifactor studies planned and evaluated using design of 
experiment concepts (DOE) in qualified SDMs. The identified CPPs in the different process steps are 
considered acceptable.  
Scale-down models 
The scale down models (SDMs) used in validation of the active substance manufacturing process were 
designed to deliver performance that is representative of the manufacturing-scale process.  
Process hold times 
Acceptable ranges for in-process hold times were determined using both microbial and biochemical 
stability studies performed at manufacturing scale with PPQ batches. For the biochemical stability 
studies, the impact of the proposed hold times was evaluated on selected CQAs. 
Process impact assessment 
Process impact (PI) assessments have been performed to assess the risk of the manufacturing process 
on CQAs. PI assessments are based on data from small-scale studies to support process performance 
acceptable ranges and criticality, biochemical in-process pool hold studies, and process linkage studies, 
as well as data from manufacturing-scale batches. The level of each CQA at different process steps was 
compared to an established limit The majority of the CQAs have been assessed to have a low residual 
risk, meaning that they are well controlled during the manufacturing process and/or effectively 
removed during the manufacturing process.The data presented in the PI assessment support the 
conclusion that the manufacturing process produces active substance of consistent quality and as such 
the PI assessment is seen as support to the comparability study.  
Sufficient information is provided on the potential residual levels of raw materials, potential leachables 
from product-contacting materials, as well as reuse, regeneration and sanitisation procedures of resins 
and membranes.  
Manufacturing process development 
Developmental history 
different versions of the active substance manufacturing process were developed. 
A comparability exercise between the process versions was performed to assess the impact of the 
manufacturing process changes on product quality.  
Overall, the results of the comparability exercise demonstrated that the manufacturing process 
changes did not have an adverse impact on the quality, safety, or efficacy of glofitamab.  
Characterisation  
Overall, the structural, physiochemical and biological characterisation of glofitamab active substance is 
considered comprehensive and sufficient.   
The structural confirmation and characterisation of the physicochemical properties of glofitamab have 
been performed using the reference standard. The characterisation studies were performed using the 
proposed commercial release analytical methods and extended characterisation methods to assess the 
primary, secondary and higher order structure, as well as post-translational modifications. Methods to 
assess the biological properties include the proposed method used for commercial release as well as 
extended characterisation methods.  
Impurities 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023

validation has been provided and demonstrates that the methods were adequately validated for their 
suitability for intended use according to ICH Q2 guideline.  
Batch analysis 
During the pharmaceutical development of glofitamab, three different processes were used for 
manufacture of nonclinical and clinical active substance material.  
Batch analyses data have been provided for all active substance batches produced by the three 
different processes. All batch data complied with the specifications valid at the time of testing. Overall, 
it is found that the batch data confirm batch-to-batch consistency and process comparability.

The approach described for assessment of extractables and leachables from the active substance 
container closure system is found adequate. The results support the safety of glofitamab drug 
substance stored frozen in the container closure system. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The stability studies are designed in accordance with the ICH Q5C guideline. A shelf life of 48 months 
is proposed at a storage condition.  
The post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment are acceptable. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Description of the product 
Columvi concentrate for solution for infusion is formulated as a sterile, preservative-free, concentrate 
for solution for infusion at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The finished product is presented in two 
configurations; 2.5 mg/2.5 ml and 10 mg/10 ml. The concentrate is a colourless aqueous solution of 
glofitamab, presented in single-dose Type I glass vials. 
Glofitamab active substance solution is diluted to 1 mg/mL with formulation buffer to produce finished 
product. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product formulation is identical to the active substance formulation with the exception of 
the concentration of glofitamab. Excipients used in the formulation are L-histidine, L-histidine 
hydrochloride monohydrate, L-methionine, D-sucrose, and polysorbate 20. No novel excipients or 
excipients of human or animal origin have been identified. Compatibility of active substance with the 
excipients is considered demonstrated by stability studies. 
The formulation remained unchanged with respect to excipient composition and concentration across 
all development phases including the commercial formulation.  
Columvi finished product manufacturing process consists of thawing of the active substance, optional 
pooling and mixing, buffer preparation, dilution and mixing, bioburden reduction filtration, sterile 
filtration, aseptic filling of vials and stoppering, capping & crimping and 100% final visual inspection 
before storage/transportation and secondary packaging.  
Three different finished product manufacturing processes comprising three different finished product 
formulations were used in clinical studies during development. 
The comparability studies demonstrate that finished products are comparable. 
The proposed commercial finished product container closure system consists of a 6 mL Type I glass 
vial, stoppered with rubber stopper for the 2.5 mg/vial finished product, and a 15 mL Type I glass vial 
stoppered with rubber stopper for the 10 mg/vial finished product.  
The results of the extractable studies performed with commercial stoppers and vials and the results of 
the leachable studies performed with the finished product demonstrate that the primary packaging 
components are suitable and safe for use for the finished product. Glofitamab is compatible with the 
primary packaging components in the container closure system, as demonstrated by long-term 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 17/158 
 
 
 
stability data for the finished product incl. testing of container closure integrity and sterility. The 
leachables studies are ongoing and will be continued until end of shelf life of the finished product to 
confirm the suitability of the commercial primary packaging configuration for the finished product.  
Columvi finished product does not contain preservatives or antioxidants. The finished product is sterile 
filtered using an aseptic filling process.  
The compatibility of dose solution with IV bags and infusion lines has been demonstrated. Stability and 
compatibility studies were conducted to confirm the physicochemical stability of the solutions for 
infusion under recommended in-use conditions.  
The in-use studies demonstrated that glofitamab is physicochemically stable after dilution into 0.9% or 
0.45% sodium chloride solution and after holding for 72 hours at 2˚C-8˚C and for an additional 24 
hours at 30˚C at ambient room light conditions, followed by a maximum infusion time of 8 hours.  
The following is applied to glofitamab: From a microbiological point of view, the prepared solution for 
infusion should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions 
prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2˚C-
8˚C, unless preparation of the solution for infusion has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic 
conditions.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
Columvi finished product is manufactured (including filling/primary packaging) by Genentech, Inc., 1 
DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. This site is also performing in-process control testing 
and quality control testing (bacterial endotoxins only). No concerns regarding GMP of finished product 
manufacturing sites have been identified during review of the quality documentation. 
The finished product manufacturing process is standard and consists of thawing of the active 
substance, pooling and mixing, bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration and aseptic vial filling, 
stoppering and capping, vial inspection and secondary packaging and storage. A detailed description of 
the manufacturing process is presented in the dossier. For several manufacturing process steps the 
product may be stored before the next step. Storage temperature and maximum storage time for each 
step is presented. No refreezing is allowed.  
Process parameters for finished product manufacturing were evaluated for their criticality with respect 
to predetermined quality attributes. The evaluated parameters cover the manufacturing process from 
thawed active substance to final vial inspection.  
Process validation 
The data from the PPQ batches demonstrate that the process runs consistently within the defined 
process parameter acceptable ranges and produces material that meets the commercial release 
acceptance criteria across the range of batch sizes.  
Media fill runs and environmental monitoring are described and found acceptable.  
Shipping qualification studies are presented for several passive and active thermal shipping systems. 
The results indicate that the finished product is adequately protected during shipping and that 
mechanical stress conditions have no impact on product quality.

The proposed finished product release and shelf life specifications for Columvi have been provided for 
both vial configurations (2.5 mg/2.5ml and 10 mg/10 ml).  
The release specification includes general tests: appearance, test for identity, tests for product-related 
impurities, test for excipient, test for protein content, test for potency, as well as tests for safety. 
Overall, the parameters included in the finished product specification are found adequate to control the 
quality of the Columvi finished product. 
The justification of the acceptance criteria is based on a combination of different information such as 
clinical experience, product-specific knowledge, applicant’s experience with related molecules, 
formulation development studies, storage and process effects, regulatory guidelines and manufacturing 
experience. Overall, the approach used to set the acceptance criteria for the finished product is 
accepted.  
The  acceptance  criteria  set  for  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  attributes  have  been  sufficiently 
justified and can be accepted. A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities was 
provided,  which  concluded  that  no  risk  of  the  presence  of  nitrosamines  was  identified  for  the  active 
substance, or finished product. 
Analytical procedures  
The analytical procedures used for release of the finished product are a combination of compendial and 
non-compendial methods. The panel of methods used to assure the quality of the finished product is in 
accordance with ICH Q6B, Ph. Eur. 2031, and EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008. The analytical 
procedures are described in sufficient details. Information on reference standard is included where 
relevant. The methods are considered suitable for their intended use. 
The compendial analytical procedures are performed in accordance with the methods described in the 
relevant pharmacopoeia.  
The non-compendial methods were adequately validated for their suitability for intended use according 
to ICH Q2 guideline.   
Characterisation of impurities  
The finished product manufacturing process consists of thawing the active substance, pooling 
(optional), dilution, filtration, and aseptic filling and capping, with no change to the formulation 
compared to the active substance. No new impurities are generated during the finished product 
manufacturing process and all impurities observed in the finished product were characterised for the 
active substance. A risk assessment for elemental impurities was conducted in accordance with ICH 
Q3D guideline. Test results for the 10 elements recommended for consideration for parenteral products 
showed that there are no concerns related to elemental impurities in the finished product produced at 
the site of commercial manufacture.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis results for finished product batches are presented in the dossier.  
All results were compliant with the acceptance criteria valid at the time of release and were consistent 
across the batches. In addition, the finished product PPQ batches met the acceptance criteria of the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 19/158 
 
 
 
 
proposed commercial specification acceptance criteria. The batch release data demonstrate consistent 
quality of the finished product throughout development and for commercial purpose. 
Reference standards 
A two-tiered reference material system has been established. Three different reference standards (RS) 
− initial, primary and secondary − have been used throughout the development of Columvi. Information 
on the batches (number, source, date of manufacture) and the use are included. Qualification of the 
RS included active substance release methods as well as additional characterisation.  
A protocol for preparation of future secondary reference standards and the qualification hereof is 
described. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for both finished product configurations is: 24 months at 2˚C-8˚C, protected 
from light. 
6 months accelerated data are presented for all primary batches. 
Primary stability studies are performed using the same analytical procedures as for finished product 
release testing. Additionally, container closure integrity testing is included for finished product stability 
studies. 
Generally, no significant trends are observed at 5±3 °C.  
The applicant commits to place one batch in long-term stability per year with yearly time points and 
testing according to the stability specification defined in section 3.2.P.5.1. 
An ICH Q1B photostability study has been conducted. Based on this, the applicant concluded that the 
finished product is photosensitive and should be stored in its outer carton to protect it from light, which 
is considered satisfactory.   
A temperature excursion study has been. The batch was exposed sequentially to varying temperature 
conditions before being placed on long-term stability (-20˚C to + 30˚C). The data confirm stability of 
finished product under conditions that might occur during manufacturing, shipping, and handling.  
Glofitamab is intended for IV administration after dilution in 0.9% or 0.45% sodium chloride via IV bag 
infusion.  Stability and compatibility studies were conducted to confirm the physicochemical stability of 
the solutions for infusion under recommended in-use conditions. The studies demonstrated that the 
glofitamab solutions for infusion are stable during typical preparation and administration procedures 
and may be held for 72 hours at 2oC-8oC and an additional 24 hours at 30oC at ambient room light 
conditions followed by a maximum infusion time of 8 hours. 
The finished product does not contain any antimicrobial preservative; therefore, sterility of the solution 
must be ensured during in-use handling by maintaining appropriate aseptic conditions. Standard SmPC 
wording is applied. 
 Based on the data provided, the shelf life and storage conditions for both finished product 
configurations are: 2 years at 2˚C-8˚C, protected from light are acceptable.  The in-use shelf life and 
storage conditions are: 72 hours at 2˚C-8˚C and 24 hours at 30˚C, with maximum infusion time of 8 
hours.

2.4.3.5.  Post approval change management protocol(s)  
Not applicable. 
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Apart from the production cell line no material from animal/human origin has been used in the 
manufacture of glofitamab active substance and finished product.  
Cell banks have been tested for nonviral and viral adventitious agents according to ICH Q5A guideline. 
The cell banks are therefore considered safe for use in the manufacture of glofitamab with regard to 
the risk of viral and non-viral adventitious agents and endogenous retroviruses. 
Testing for nonviral and viral adventitious agents is conducted in the routine manufacture of glofitamab 
active substance at different stages of production. The testing conducted during manufacture and at 
release is considered sufficient and in line with current requirements. 
The viral clearance capacity of the glofitamab active substance purification process was evaluated by 
conducting viral clearance studies, using qualified SDMs in accordance with ICH Q5A guideline.  
Overall, the risk of contamination with adventitious agents, including TSE, mycoplasma, bacteria, 
fungi, and viruses, is considered well contained based on selection of safe raw materials, 
demonstration of absence of adventitious (and endogenous) agents in cell banks, testing at relevant 
stages of the process, and finally the substantial virus clearance capacity, demonstrated for the 
glofitamab purification process. In conclusion, Columvi is considered safe for commercial purposes with 
regard to risk of contamination with adventitious non-viral or viral agents or with endogenous viruses. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The dossier presented in support of the Marketing Authorisation Application for Columvi is of good 
quality.  
The control strategy for the glofitamab active substance manufacturing process was established in line 
with ICH 11 guidance. Overall, the manufacturing process is considered adequately described and the 
applied process parameters and in-process controls, as well as their ranges, and the control of starting 
materials are considered adequate to control the process and ensure formation of active substance of 
adequate and consistent quality. Overall, the approach taken to validate glofitamab manufacturing 
process is considered adequate. The process is demonstrated to perform consistently and glofitamab 
active substance meets all the biochemical, functional and microbiological acceptance criteria. The 
process development, including development of the control strategy, is considered adequately 
described and justified. Comparability studies confirm product comparability throughout development.  
The selection of the attributes included in the active substance specification is based on the control 
strategy. Overall, the approach for selecting attributes and setting the acceptance criteria for both

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Glofitamab is  designed to bind to two different antigens, namely CD20 expressed on target B cells and 
CD3 expressed on effector T cells. Glofitamab’s activity and specificity was characterized in a wide 
range of nonclinical  models: 
• 
• 
• 
in vitro models: consisted of co-cultures of DLBCL tumor target cell lines expressing  various 
levels of CD20 antigen and healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (PBMCs) 
ex vivo models: consisted of primary tumor samples derived from freshly isolated or  previously 
frozen bone marrow samples from patients with non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma (NHL) 
in vivo nonclinical pharmacology studies: consisted of the use of both non-tumor  bearing 
human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-engrafted NOD/Shi scid/IL-2Rγnull  (HSC-NOG) mice 
[Hayakawa et al. 2009], and tumor-bearing HSC-NOG and HSC-engrafted NOD.Cg-
PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ [HSC-NSG] mice. The two DLBCL tumor cell line models utilized for in 
vivo studies were WSU-DLCL2 and OCI-Ly18. 
The choice of the cynomolgus monkey as the pharmacological and toxicological species is considered 
justified as comparable cross-reactivity is observed between human and monkey B cells while no 
cross-reactivity is observed for rodent, dog or minipig CD20 or CD3ε. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
 In vitro pharmacology 
In vitro, glofitamab binds in a bivalent mode to both human and cynomolgus monkey CD20 on primary 
B cells with comparable EC50 values. Glofitamab does not cross-react to conventional toxicology 
species like rodent, dog, rabbit or minipig CD20. Glofitamab also binds to T cells monovalently, 
targeting CD3ε in the TCR complex, cross-reacting with both human and cynomolgus monkey CD3ε, as 
the binding epitope is conserved between human and cynomolgus  monkey, but again not with CD3ε of

conventional toxicology species. It was demonstrated in vitro that only simultaneous binding of 
glofitamab to CD20 on tumor B cells and to CD3ε on T cells  results in CD3ε cross-linking leading to T-
cell activation and proliferation, and subsequent tumor cell lysis.  
Table 1 EC50 Values of Tumor Cell Lysis Mediated by Glofitamab on a Panel of DLBCL Tumor Cell Lines 
Expressing Various Levels of CD20 Antigen 
Glofitamab-induced tumor cell lysis in in vitro assays was shown to be dose-dependent in a broad panel 
of DLBCL tumor cell lines,  and not to correlate with CD20 expression levels, indicating that glofitamab is 
highly efficacious in low CD20-expressing tumor cell lines. Glofitamab-mediated tumor cell lysis was 
shown to occur even at low CD20 receptor occupancy, as <0.5% of CD20 receptor occupancy resulted 
in the lysis of 50% of tumor cells. In vitro, glofitamab was shown to deplete B cells in human and 
cynomolgus monkey whole blood leading to mean EC50 values of 50.0 pM and 806 pM for human and 
cynomolgus monkey, respectively. When investigated ex vivo in primary tumor samples (i.e. whole 
bone marrow aspirates), which retains the native tumor environment, from patients with different 
types of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL, e.g. mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), splenic marginal zone 
lymphoma (SMZL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL)), glofitamab 
displayed strong anti-tumor activity and led to high  overall killing of target cells, paralleled by T-cell 
activation and expansion in all samples. The activity of glofitamab was also compared to other CD20- 
and CD19-targeting TCB antibodies. Glofitamab’s “2:1” bivalent binding mode was demonstrated as 
superior with an average of 40-fold (range: 12-95-fold) stronger potency compared to other “1:1” 
monovalently binding TCB antibodies with the same anti-CD20 and anti-CD3 binders, supporting the 
relevance of CD20 avidity/bivalency and the close spatial  proximity via a flexible linker of the CD3 and 
CD20 binders (head-to-tail orientation) in  glofitamab. Also, against a CD20-targeting “1:1 IgG-like” 
format TCB antibody  with alternative anti-CD20, anti-CD3, and Fc sequences as well as other CD19 and 
CD20 targeted TCBs (e.g. blinatumomab), glofitamab demonstrated more potent activity.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 23/158 
 
 
 
 
The activity of glofitamab was investigated in vitro in the presence of obinutuzumab, which can be co-
administered to potentially reduce the cytokine release in connection with treatment with glofitamab as 
well as the development of anti-drug antibodies. Glofitamab and obinutuzumab both bind to the CD20 
antigen via the same CD20-binding antibody variable regions, thus competing with each other by 
bivalent binding to CD20-expressing target cells. At saturating concentrations of obinutuzumab (thus 
occupying all CD20 receptors) a transient reduction of CD20 occupancy by glofitamab is achieved, 
which was observed as a ~30-fold reduction in glofitamab potency. Due to the “2:1” TCB molecular 
format of glofitamab, the molecule has the capacity to displace obinutuzumab  from the CD20 antigen 
and initiate T-cell redirected cytotoxicity, thus adding to the  activity of obinutuzumab in vitro. Adding 
increasing concentrations of glofitamab to  saturating concentrations of obinutuzumab (inducing 
approximately 70% cell lysis in itself) resulted in almost complete elimination of tumor cells. Though 
glofitamab was able to induce direct cell death in selected cell lines, this occurred at very high doses, 
which the applicant pointed out is significantly above the concentrations used for T-cell redirected cell 
cytotoxicity, which is identified as the primary mode of action of glofitamab. 
In vivo pharmacology 
Glofitamab was investigated in vivo in two different strains of mice, HSC-NSG and HSC-NOG mice. 
Both mice strains lack functional T and B cells  and have defects in NK-cell activity, macrophage 
function, complement activity, and  dendritic cell function, and the immunodeficiency mechanism is 
very similar. The results between the two strains appeared to be similar. In vivo activity was 
investigated in both non-tumor bearing HSC-NOG mice and in tumor-bearing HSG-NOG and HSG-NSG 
mice. In non-tumor bearing mice, it was demonstrated that 500 µg/kg weekly (QW) dosing efficiently 
depleted circulating B cells within 24 hours of first administration, leaving their numbers undetectable 
for up to 240 h.

Peripheral blood T cells showed a  transient decrease 24 hours after the first glofitamab injection, then 
returned to baseline  levels within 72 hours, and remained stable for the rest of the study. This was 
observed in parallel to transient increases in multiple cytokines and chemokines 24 h after first 
injection, which subsequently decreased after 72 h and returned to baseline levels 72 hours after the 
second glofitamab  injection. Also, T cell activation was observed 72 h after first injection, of which only 
2 of 4 markers returned to baseline 72 h after the second injection.

Glofitamab-induced B cell depletion was furthermore observed in spleen and lymph node at 72 h after 
second injection of 500 µg/kg QW dose of glofitamab, however, T-cell counts showed levels 
comparable to vehicle  control. The T cell activation profile was similar in spleen and lymph node as in 
blood. When given to HSC-NOG tumor bearing mice at three different doses (50, 150 and 500 µg/kg 
QW), glofitamab induced similar results within the first 24 as observed in non-tumor bearing mice for 
B- and T-cell depletion. Increases of multiple cytokines and chemokines were observed in the 
peripheral blood in HSC-NSG tumor-bearing mice 24 h after first dosing. Only the two highest doses 
(i.e. 150 and 500 µg/kg QW) were able to induce regression of established  subcutaneous (SC) tumors 
in HSG-NOG mice, and not the lowest, though B-cell depletion was already observed at this dose level. 
Beside reduction in tumor size, histological examinations of tumor tissue following treatment with 500 
µg/kg QW glofitamab showed a strong increase in the frequency of intra-tumor T-cell infiltration and 
an up-regulation of PD-1 receptors on T cells as well as of its ligand, PD-L1. As observed in blood, 
glofitamab-mediated B-cell depletion was seen in the spleen, as well as in lymph nodes at study 
termination (72 hours after the second injection) whereas T-cell counts showed levels comparable to 
vehicle control (Figure 2-6B). The T-cell activation status was similar to that observed in blood, with 
higher expression of granzyme B and PD-1 in splenic T cells of glofitamab-treated mice as compared to 
vehicle control.

Role of Obinutuzumab  
Treatment with glofitamab is associated with severe safety issues when given alone, due to significant 
cytokine release as a part of its mode of action. Cytokine release is related to the load of circulating 
and tissue-resident B cells, as the higher the load, the higher the T-cell engagement, activation, and 
cytokine release in the peripheral blood. In an attempt to alleviate the extent of cytokine release and 
associated safety issues, the applicant conducted studies to investigate the effect of obinutuzumab 
given prior to glofitamab treatment in order to debulk the peripheral and tissue-resident B cells. 
Obinutuzumab is considered relevant as pretreatment for glofitamab (gpt) as it shares the same CD20-
binding antibody variable regions as glofitamab, and leads to an efficient pre-depletion of mainly normal 
B cells in the peripheral  blood and tissues (B-cell de-bulking). Obinutuzumab was chosen over 
rituximab as gpt, as the applicant claims that obinutuzumab showed superior tissue B-cell depletion 
compared to e.g. rituximab in  cynomolgus monkeys. The applicant has sufficiently shown the 
superiority of obinutuzumab over rituximab in depleting B cells in lymph nodes, spleen and human 
whole blood according to Moessner et al 2010, leading to a faster depletion of B cells and greater direct 
cytotoxicity in CLL cells, as well as a well-tolerated safety profile in patients. The choice to use 
obinutuzumab over rituximab for B-cell debulking and mitigation of glofitamab-mediated CRS is 
supported.  
When given once 7 days prior to glofitamab treatment (500 µg/kg) to HSC-NOG tumor bearing mice, 
obinutuzumab strongly reduced the glofitamab-mediated cytokine release and thereby the cytokine-
dependent T-cell decrease in peripheral blood. It was also shown that obinutuzumab does not interfere 
with glofitamab-mediated B-cell depletion and anti-tumor activity. Obinutuzumab in itself mediates anti-
tumor effects via B-cell depletion (but no effect on T-cells or upregulation of cytokines) when given by 
repeated dosing at saturating concentrations, though with slower kinetics than glofitamab. The applicant 
however argues that obinutuzumab used as gpt with a single dose is not sufficient to induce anti-tumor 
effect and will not contribute to the anti-tumor effect of repeated dosing of glofitamab. Though not 
demonstrated in non-clinical studies, this rationale can be accepted and it has also been demonstrated 
in the clinic that a single dose of obinutuzumab in conjunction with a low non-efficacious dose of 
glofitamab did not show any relevant anti-tumor activity. Step-up dosing was investigated as an 
CHMP assessment report

alternative to gpt. While gpt showed superior effects on minimizing cytokine release, the long-term anti-
tumour effect was comparable between the groups receiving gpt and step-up dosing. Dexamethasone 
was also investigated as pre-medication and led to a reduction in the glofitamab-mediated cytokine 
release. In the animal model, it was shown that the administration of both dexamethasone and 
obinutuzumab in connection with a step-up dosing of glofitamab did not affect the anti-tumor effect of 
glofitamab, confirming the potency of glofitamab treatment and the lack of pharmacodynamic 
interactions with pre-treatment/pre-medication agents. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The Fc region of glofitamab was engineered to abolish interactions with effector function relevant Fc-
receptors, due to the “P329G LALA” mutation introduced in the Fc binding region. The lack of binding to 
the Fcγ receptors was demonstrated in an in vitro study using FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb and FcγRIIIa as 
well as human C1q. Thus, it has been demonstrated that glofitamab has a low potential for Fcγ receptor 
cross-linking and C1q complement binding on immune cells leading to induction of nontargeted 
immune cell activation (e.g. ADCC, ADCP and CDC). 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were conducted with glofitamab. Safety pharmacology 
end-points were included as part of the 2- and 4-week repeat dose studies with glofitamab in 
cynomolgus monkeys, where effects related to the cardiovascular system, respiration and CNS were 
monitored. Glofitamab was associated with sustained, dose-dependent increases in heart rate after the 
first dosing (30-70 bpm higher than in control animals). Effects were less pronounced after second 
dosing. Further, administration of glofitamab also resulted in increases in body temperature. These 
observations are considered related to the pharmacological action of glofitamab and secondary to 
increases in cytokine levels induced by T-cell activation. No glofitamab-related changes were observed 
in respiration or CNS related endpoints. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
An assessment of the potential interactions between glofitamab and obinutuzumab as well as with 
steroid premedication was part of the primary pharmacology.  
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK/TK of glofitamab was investigated in C57BL/6 mice, huFcRn transgenic mice, Göttingen 
minipigs (all species without target binding) and in cynomolgus monkeys (cross-reactive species) in a 
series of IV and SC single- and repeat dose studies. Cynomolgus monkeys exhibit similar binding to 
CD3 and CD20 as in humans, and were selected for pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies. Pre-
treatment with obinutuzumab (clinical pre-treatment) was also investigated in this species. Due to a 
high incidence of ADA in cynomolgus monkeys with associated loss of exposure and loss of 
pharmacological effect, repeat-dose toxicology studies of more than 4 weeks were not conducted. 
Waivers for omission of a 13-week study were granted by both FDA (REF ID: 4362929) and EMA 
(Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/4023/1/2018/I and EMEA/H/SA/4023/2/2019/III). Further, PK/PD 
modelling based on in vivo studies involving tumor growth inhibition in humanized tumour-bearing 
mice or cytokine release in cynomolgus monkeys was performed, and plasma protein binding and 
blood/plasma partitioning was investigated in mouse, cynomolgus monkey, and human blood.

Group 4 animals received 100 µg/kg on Day 8, as toxicity due to the release of cytokines was only expected on Day 1 
Method validation 
The ligand-binding assays (ELISAs) developed to measure glofitamab and anti-glofitamab antibodies in 
cynomolgus monkey serum in support of the GLP pivotal toxicology studies have been suitably 
validated in line with relevant guidance documents (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev 1 Corr 2). 
Further, the ligand-binding assays used to quantify glofitamab in mouse serum (in support of 2 non-
GLP studies) and obinutuzumab in monkey serum (in support of a non-GLP study) were suitably 
validated. The bioanalytical methods used in remaining PK and non-GLP studies were qualified and 
considered suitable for their intended use. 
Single-dose PK/TK studies  
PK parameters of glofitamab in the non-target binding species mice and mini-pigs following IV dosing 
were within expected range for a human IgG, and displayed similar half-lives (8.5 and 6 days, 
respectively) and clearance (8 ml/day/kg in both species). Volume of distribution was close to plasma 
volume in both species, indicating an initial propensity for glofitamab to remain in the vascular 
compartment. 
Following IV single-dosing of glofitamab at doses from 1.0-100 µg/kg (a 0.3 µg/kg dose group was 
omitted due to negligible exposure, and the highest dose at 300 µg/kg was not tolerated) in male and 
female cynomolgus monkeys (MTD-study), AUC0-last increased in a greater than dose-proportional 
manner across the dose range tested. Cmax increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner from 
1.0-10.0 µg/kg and less than dose-proportional from 10.0 through 100.0 µg/kg. No significant sex 
differences were noted for the evaluated PK parameters. Glofitamab displayed dose-dependent kinetics 
with an overall tendency for clearance and volume of distribution to decrease with increasing doses, 
consistent with TMDD. Even at the HNSTD (100.0 µg/kg), CL values were markedly higher than in the 
non-responder species mouse and minipig and apparent t1/2 values were shorter (CL≈200-900 
ml/day/kg; t1/2≈3-5 hours). All animals tested positive for ADA at 336 hours (14 days) post-dosing 
CHMP assessment report

which did, however, not impact exposure due to the rapid clearance of glofitamab before ADA 
presence.  
In monkeys, pre-treatment with obinutuzumab (Gpt) increased exposure (AUC0-last) of glofitamab 
approximately 4.5-fold following IV dosing compared to exposure in animals not receiving Gpt. 
Clearance of glofitamab decreased markedly with Gpt (81.2 vs 384 ml/day/kg without Gpt), and t1/2 
increased from 7.5 to 67.7 hours, illustrating the effect of initial CD20+ B cell depletion by Gpt and 
associated decrease in TMDD. However, even after Gpt, the clearance of glofitamab remained high 
compared to the typical value for mAbs in this species (5-12 ml/day/kg; Deng et al. 2011). The 
applicant considered plasma protein binding as potential root cause for the short half-life of glofitamab. 
This hypothesis was addressed in a study that evaluated the partitioning of radiolabelled glofitamab 
from whole blood into plasma or the cellular fraction. The study showed that partitioning into plasma 
occurred at a comparable rate in cynomolgus and human plasma; by SE-HPLC of plasma a single 
radioactive peak was detected, with a retention time similar to that of the radiolabelled glofitamab. 
Thus, the study did not provide evidence to support plasma protein binding as cause for the increased 
clearance in cynomolgus monkeys. The applicant adequately justified that binding to CD3 is not 
assumed to contribute to TMDD due to the stronger binding to CD20 compared to CD3. Also, it was 
shown in the 2-week toxicity study that the total number of T cells increased after glofitamab dosing, 
while CL was not increased, demonstrating a lack of correlation between CD3 binding and CL. Data 
from other species (mice, minipigs) as well as humans, suggest the rapid clearance to be species-
specific and of limited clinical relevance. Gpt did not prevent ADA-formation in the study. 
Repeat-dose TK studies  
Overall, observations from single dose PK studies were generally confirmed in IV repeat-dose studies 
of 2- and 4 weeks duration in monkeys (conducted without Gpt), i.e. no sex differences were noted, CL 
and Vd decreased with dose (in agreement with depletion of endogenous B-cell levels) and AUC 
increased in a greater-than dose-proportional manner when multiple dose levels were tested (2-week 
study).  
In the 2-week IV repeat-dose study, CL on Day 8 was reduced compared with CL on Day 1, and AUC0-
last values were approximately 2-fold higher, in line with a decrease in TMDD after initial depletion of B 
cell on Day 1. All treated cynomolgus monkeys in the 2-week study became ADA-positive at 48 or 96 
hours after the second dose on Day 8. It is not expected that the presence of ADA impacted exposure 
significantly, as elimination of glofitamab was near complete at these time-points.   
In order to mitigate the high prevalence of ADA and account for the rapid clearance of glofitamab 
observed in monkeys, a step-up dosing regimen combined with every-other-day (EOD) dosing was 
implemented in the 4-week GLP toxicology study. Animals were dosed IV or SC at ascending doses of 
µg/kg (IV and SC) or (SC) at Day 1, Day 2 and EOD from Day 3 to 27, respectively. Mean Cmax and 
AUC0-48h values after IV administration were 2.68 µg/mL and 20.30 µg*h/mL on Day 3 and 2.76 µg/mL 
and 29.55 µg*h/mL on Day 11, respectively; the latter being the overall highest exposure achieved via 
the IV-route across toxicology studies. Only negligible accumulation occurred with IV-dosing from Day 
3 to Day 11 (1.4-1.5 fold), likely due to ADA formation, as 4/10 glofitamab-treated animals were ADA-
positive 48 hours post dosing on Day 11. levels. The SC bioavailability was % and % in male and 
female animals on Day 11. The bioavailability is not expected to translate to the clinical setting, due to 
previously described atypical PK of glofitamab in monkeys. Overall, there was no mitigation of ADA-
formation with the step-up dosing regimen as 27/30 animals were ADA-positive by Day 27 with 
associated loss of exposure.     
In summary, glofitamab was shown to be highly immunogenic in cynomolgus monkeys and to lead to 
loss of exposure and pharmacological effect in repeat-dose studies. Consequently, no further/longer 
toxicology studies were conducted, which is accepted. The presence of ADA in preclinical species are

Page 31/158 
 
 
 
often not predictive of immunogenicity in humans; accordingly, the occurrence of ADA was low in the 
clinical setting.    
Due to the absence of Gpt combined with the high species-specific clearance of glofitamab observed in 
cynomolgus monkeys as well as immunogenicity in the toxicology studies, exposures obtained in 
repeat-dose studies did not exceed those obtained in the clinical setting.    
Distribution 
The applicant did not submit specific studies on in vivo distribution. This is acceptable, as in 
accordance with regulatory guidelines for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (ICH S6), no tissue 
distribution studies are considered necessary. Volumes of distribution for glofitamab are reported from 
PK/TK studies under section 3.3. “Absorption” and approximates serum volume in mice and 
cynomolgus monkeys, which indicates an initial distribution within the vascular space after IV 
administration. 
An in vitro binding assay, indicated that glofitamab is mostly contained in plasma, and does not 
distribute to red blood cells to any appreciable extent. There were no species- or concentration-
dependent differences. Further, glofitamab did not bind to plasma proteins under the conditions tested.  
Metabolism 
No dedicated metabolism studies were provided for glofitamab. This is acceptable, in line with ICH 
S6(R1), as the expected consequence of metabolism of glofitamab is degradation to small peptides and 
individual amino acids, and as such the metabolic pathway is generally understood. 
Excretion 
No dedicated excretion studies were performed with glofitamab, which is acceptable in line with ICH S6 
(R1). IgG antibodies are expected to undergo catabolism by proteolysis in lysosomes, and the resulting 
amino acids may subsequently be excreted or added to the endogenous amino acid pool. Excretion into 
milk was not investigated, but is assumed to be similar to that of other IgG antibodies, which are 
present in milk, although to a limited extent compared to e.g. secretory IgA (Van de Perre, 2003). 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No dedicated PK drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies were performed with glofitamab. This is 
considered acceptable, as there is minimal involvement of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system in the 
metabolism of monoclonal antibodies.  
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
Three additional PK studies were submitted by the applicant. These included a PK comparability study 
of glofitamab Phase 1 and Phase 3 material in huFcRn mice, where bioequivalence based on AUC0-inf 
and Cmax after IV administration was confirmed between Phase 1 and Phase 3 material in mice 
expressing the human FcRn; and two supportive PK/PD modelling studies, used to derive glofitamab 
doses for the first-in-human administration of glofitamab. Efficacious glofitamab doses in humans were 
predicted based on tumour growth inhibition in humanised NSG mice. In a second model, cytokine 
release after glofitamab treatment was predicted based on PK parameters derived from 3 toxicity 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys and in vitro cytokine release data from human and cynomolgus whole 
blood.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
All findings following single dosing in the non-GLP studies in cynomolgus monkeys were reversible and 
were associated with the pharmacological action of glofitamab, specifically related to acute phase 
reaction due to cytokine release. It was observed that pre-treatment with obinutuzumab generally 
resulted in less severe findings, however, increased levels of cytokines were observed nonetheless, 
resulting in associated clinical findings as well as changes in hematology and clinical chemistry 
parameters. Furthermore, pre-treatment was not sufficient to alleviate the development of anti-drug 
antibodies, as immunogenic reactions were observed in all recovery animals, thus affecting the 
achieved exposure. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Observations in the two GLP repeat dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys of 2 and 4-weeks duration, 
respectively, were all generally mild and reversible in nature, and were assessed as indicators of acute 
phase reaction associated with cytokine release after glofitamab-induced T cell activation. 3 animals in 
the 2-week GLP study were however prematurely euthanized due to severe clinical findings (vomiting, 
lethargia, hunched posture, and hypothermia),  erosions in the GI tract, and mixed cell infiltrates in 
several organs, which correlated with very high cytokine peaks 4 h after dosing. Most of the findings in 
the surviving animals were observed within 24 h after first treatment, correlating with reduction in B 
cells, T cell activation and subsequent cytokine release, which were observed as clinical signs, acute 
phase reactions, changes in leukocytes, and  increase in HR and body temperature. After the recovery 
period observations generally returned to baseline levels corresponding to levels of the control group. 
Only short-term studies up to 4 weeks for repeated dosing of glofitamab are available, as predominant 
ADA development and consequently diminished exposure and PD effect were observed in almost all of 
the animals of all tested dose groups. Though both step-up dosing and pre-treatment with 
obinutuzumab was investigated, only limited differences in exposure were observed, and it was not 
sufficient to avoid ADA development. Thus, there is no rationale for conducting a 13-week repeat dose 
study in cynomolgus monkeys as limited exposure is anticipated after a short time due to ADA 
development. The waiver for omitting the 13-week study is therefore accepted, also as the observed 
effects of glofitamab is similar to that observed for other B-cell depleting agents, and no unexpected 
findings have been observed. It is also agreed that use of other in vivo models in e.g. rhesus monkeys 
or mice, is not warranted based on the available data for glofitamab. SC administration of glofitamab 
resulted in the attenuation of cytokine release. When glofitamab treatment was investigated with or 
without pre-treatment with obinutuzumab, it was shown that pre-treatment attenuated cytokine 
release, which allowed a dosing of 10x the dose resulting in severe CRS-related findings in non-pre-
treatment animals, thus justifying the clinical treatment strategy of using obinutuzumab pre-
treatment. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1) and ICH S9 guideline no information has been submitted for the 
mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of glofitamab, which is acceptable. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 33/158 
 
 
 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with glofitamab. This is consistent with the current 
ICH guidance on the preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals ICH S6 
(R1) and ICH S9. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Male and female fertility was investigated as part of the 4-week GLP study in sexually mature 
cynomolgus monkeys. No glofitamab-related findings were observed in male and female reproductive 
endpoints up to the highest dose tested (100 µg/kg), which corresponds to exposure multiples of 0.36 
and 0.28 in relation to Cmax and AUC0-48h, respectively. However, due to severe ADA formation, loss of 
PD effect and exposure was observed during the short-term study. 
In line with the ICH S9 guideline, no dedicated studies investigating the effect of glofitamab on fertility 
and early embryonic development (FEED) or pre- and postnatal toxicology (PPND) were performed. 
The applicant submitted a waiver for not performing the embryofetal (EFD)/ enhanced (e)PPND study 
with glofitamab, providing an extensive discussion of known class effects on pregnancy of anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibodies (i.e. rituximab, obinutuzumab and ocrelizumab), which has been investigated in 
(e)PPND or EFD studies as well as the observed effects of glofitamab in nonclinical and clinical studies. 
Common for the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies is the pharmacologic effect of B-cell depletion in 
dams  and the offspring observed consistently across programs in animal studies, which was reversible 
upon drug washout. Investigations of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have shown the following: 
i) Opportunistic infections and immune complex mediated hypersensitivity reactions in pregnant dams, 
presumably due to B-cell depletion and immunogenicity responses of cynomolgus monkeys to human 
proteins, respectively. No teratogenicity observed (obinutuzumab). 
ii) Perinatal mortality (some associated with bacterial infections), renal toxicity (glomerulopathy and 
inflammation), and lymphoid follicle formation in the bone marrow in pregnant monkeys. No 
teratogenicity observed (ocrelizumab). 
iii) A murine surrogate molecule of blinatumomab crossed the placental barrier in pregnant mice but 
did not cause embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity. 
iiii) Full-length IgG antibodies (<5,000 Da) have low placental transfer during the first trimester, the 
period of organogenesis, in NHP and humans and thus have low teratogenicity potential (refer to ICH 
S6(R1)). 
While it has been shown that glofitamab also depletes B cells as part of the pharmacological action, 
increasing the incidence of opportunistic infection secondary to B-cell depletion following  dosing, 
glofitamab also exerts its pharmacological action via transient T cell activation and cytokine release 
primarily following the first dose. The cytokine release results in acute adverse reactions such as 
vomiting, diarrhea,  hypoactivity/hunched posture, hypotension, tachycardia, fever, acute phase 
protein  reactions and leukocyte margination in cynomolgus monkeys, which may have a negative 
impact during pregnancy. Further, it appears that cytokines may be involved in establishing and 
maintaining pregnancy, thus potentially resulting in foetal loss when the cytokine levels are affected 
during the early period of pregnancy. Taken together, the toxicities associated with T cell activation 
and cytokine release as well as B cell depletion may pose a risk to the maintenance of early pregnancy. 
Based on the provided justification, it is assumed that infections secondary to glofitamab-induced B-
cell depletion as well as acute toxicities following cytokine release may result in increased risk of 
neonatal loss in cynomolgus monkeys, though no teratogenic effects are expected due to the low 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 34/158 
 
 
 
placental transfer during the first trimester. Similar adverse toxicities following glofitamab 
administration have been identified in the clinic and includes cytokine release syndrome, neutropenia 
and infections, in line with what has been observed in repeat dose studies in monkeys. Based on the 
justification provided, and in accordance with ICH S6 (R1) it is agreed that no further testing is 
required in order to elucidate the reproductive toxicity of glofitamab in cynomolgus monkeys, as it is 
not likely it will add further information to the current non-clinical and clinical knowledge to support the 
mitigation of this risk in humans. It is considered that glofitamab should not be used during pregnancy 
in humans due to the identified risks, which has been adequately reflected in the SmPC section 4.6 and 
5.3. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
 A high overall incidence of ADAs was observed in all toxicology studies in monkeys, leading to loss of 
exposure and PD effects over time. Higher exposure levels were obtained with Gpt, however, ADA 
formation was not prevented. In summary, obtained exposure levels in toxicology studies conducted 
without Gpt did not exceed those obtained in the clinical setting, as estimations of exposure multiples 
resulted in values of 0.03 to 0.28 (based on AUC), implying that CRS-related effects occur at clinically 
relevant dose levels. The same results are approximately achieved when comparing Cmax in 
cynomolgus monkeys with humans (i.e. exposure multiples of 0.27 to 0.36). The low exposure 
multiples are considered acceptable, taking into account the indication (advanced cancer), that the 
expected adverse effects of glofitamab occurs mainly due to exaggerated pharmacology or secondary 
to it, and that no obvious alternative animal species besides the monkey are available for toxicology 
studies. When glofitamab was administered after pre-treatment with obinutuzumab, higher doses could 
be administered resulting in an exposure multiple to the human dose of 3.74 based on Cmax. 
Cytokine Release Syndrome is an identified risk in the clinic and is primarily observed after the first 
dosing with glofitamab with signs of CRS including pyrexia, tachycardia, hypotension, chills, hypoxia, 
headache, and nausea. Potentially secondary effects to CRS observed in the clinic includes 
hepatotoxicity, neurological adverse events, cardiovascular effects and neutropenia. Thus, findings in 
cynomolgus monkeys are well described in humans and correlate with findings in the single and 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals. A sufficient overview of the identified risks has been included in 
the SmPC and discussed in the RMP covering the effects observed in cynomolgus monkeys. Both pre-
treatment and step-up dosing has been used in the clinic to manage the effects of CRS, in line with 
what has been investigated in animals. 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was evaluated as part of the single or repeat dose GLP studies following IV or SC 
administration in cynomolgus monkeys. No changes were observed that indicated local intolerance. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
The formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) has been investigated as part of the toxicological studies 
and has been thoroughly discussed in the sections above. Overall, ADA formation has been observed to 
severely influence the results in both the single dose and repeat dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys, as decreased exposure was observed in all the studies, thus not reaching the exposure level 
in humans at clinically relevant dose levels. No ADA formation has been observed in patients in the 
clinical studies.

The applicant conducted an in vitro binding assay for human Fcγ receptors, where glofitamab showed 
no detectable binding to the Fcγ receptors tested, and further, no binding to C1q was demonstrated. 
This is expected due to the “P329G LALA” mutation introduced in the Fc binding region which results in 
minimal capability of binding to effector cells via this region. It is assessed that glofitamab has a low 
potential for Fcγ receptor cross-linking and C1q complement binding on immune cells leading to 
induction of nontargeted immune cell activation (e.g. ADCC, ADCP and CDC). 
Further, the applicant investigated the in vitro potential of glofitamab to induce cytokine release and T-
cell activation in human and cynomolgus monkey whole blood. EC50-values for interspecies 
comparison were available for a subset of the cytokines tested (IL-6, TNFα and IFNγ), and indicated a 
marked difference in potency of glofitamab to induce IL-6 release; i.e. EC50-values for glofitamab-
induced IL-6 release were 67-fold higher in cynomolgus monkeys compared to humans. Glofitamab 
was also more potent in inducing TNFα and IFNγ-release in human whole blood compared to 
cynomolgus monkey, however, this difference was more modest (within 4-fold). Glofitamab induced T 
cell activation in whole blood from both species, evident by an upregulation of CD25+ and CD69+ on 
both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, and EC50 values indicated that glofitamab induced T cell activation with 
a 2-4-fold higher potency in human whole blood compared to monkeys. 
Monoclonal antibodies have limited penetration across the blood-brain barrier due to the size of the 
molecule. Further, no evidence of off-target binding related to CNS effects have been observed for 
glofitamab and no evidence to suggest affected behaviour or activity patterns have been observed in 
general toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. The weight of evidence indicates that glofitamab has 
a low likelihood for abuse potential. 
The active substance and drug product are generally well controlled at production level and potential 
process derived impurities are cleared to low levels. Thus, no impurities have been identified that are 
of toxicological concern. 
A GLP tissue cross-reactivity IHC study was conducted with biotinylated glofitamab in normal human 
tissues from three donors. Staining with glofitamab was observed in plasma membranes and 
cytoplasm of mononuclear cells in several lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. This is expected, 
considering the glofitamab target expression of CD3 on T cells and CD20 on B cells, respectively. A 
biotinylated untargeted control antibody with the same CD3 binder (untargeted control antibody) also 
stained mononuclear cells in a subset of the same tissues, in agreement with CD3 being the only target 
antigen for the untargeted control antibody. However, glofitamab did not stain blood cells (evaluated 
on peripheral blood smears) or bone marrow (evaluated on bone marrow smears). This is unexpected, 
since T and B lymphocytes should be present in the blood samples and at least B cells should be 
present in bone marrow. The applicant argues that the absence of staining in blood smears and bone 
marrow is most likely due to technical limitations of the immunohistochemistry method used in TCR 
studies, which is accepted. 
Unexpected cross-reactivity was observed for both glofitamab and the untargeted control antibody, 
and included for both test articles cytoplasmic staining of mast cells and/or macrophages (in most 
tissues for glofitamab, in fewer for the untargeted control antibody); of smooth myocytes in most 
tissues; and of striated (skeletal and cardiac) myocytes. CD20 and CD3 are not known to be expressed 
in these tissues, however, as the binding was cytoplasmic in nature, and as both glofitamab and the 
untargeted control antibodyare expected not to have cytoplasmic access in vivo, this is not considered 
of specific toxicological concern. The applicant supplied relevant literature to support this claim (Leach 
et al, 2010), in which it is also stated that biotinylation of a test article may increase off-target cross-
reactivity with cytoplasmic structures. In addition, ICH S6 (R1) states that tissue binding to areas not 
typically accessible to the antibody in vivo (i.e. cytoplasm) is generally not relevant. 
CHMP assessment report

Glofitamab was tested for hemolytic potential and blood compatibility. In vitro, glofitamab did not 
induce hemolysis, turbidity or precipitation in human whole blood when tested at concentrations up to 
2.5 mg/mL. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a monoclonal antibody which will be broken down by proteolysis, the use of 
which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Supportive 
documentation was provided, showing that monoclonal antibodies in general can be expected to be 
readily biodegradable and of low ecotoxicity. Based on these considerations, glofitamab is not expected 
to pose a risk to the environment. 
Considering the submitted data, glofitamab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology of glofitamab was thoroughly described in the provided non-clinical package and the 
mode of action and pharmacological effect has been demonstrated sufficiently via in vitro, ex vivo and 
in vivo studies. To alleviate the extent of cytokine release and associated safety issues as well as ADA 
formation, obinutuzumab was given prior to glofitamab treatment in order to debulk the peripheral and 
tissue-resident B cells. Obinutuzumab was chosen over rituximab as pre-treatment agent, as the 
applicant claims that obinutuzumab showed superior tissue B-cell depletion compared to e.g. rituximab 
in cynomolgus monkeys. Based on data provided by the applicant, the choice of obinutuzumab over 
rituximab seems to be supported in animal models, as a more efficient and faster depletion of B cells 
has been observed. It should however be noted that the animal models are not considered to 
completely reflect the clinical context where prior anti-CD20 treatment has been given before 
glofitamab treatment, as this is intended for treatment in 3L+ DLBCL, resulting in depletion of B cells 
before initiating pre-treatment with obinutuzumab. Hence, this limits the ability to infer superiority of 
obinutuzumab over rituximab in the intended clinical setting. Glofitamab showed no binding to the Fcγ 
receptors tested, which is expected due to the “P329G LALA” mutation introduced in the Fc binding 
region, resulting in minimal capability of binding to effector cells via this region. As such, it appears 
there is a low potential for glofitamab to induce non-targeted immune cell activation (e.g. ADCC, ADCP 
and CDC), via Fcγ receptor cross-linking and C1q complement binding on immune cells.   
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of glofitamab was adequately described in the nonclinical package. In 
cynomolgus monkeys, glofitamab kinetics were dose-dependent and consistent with target-mediated 
drug disposition. Cl decreased with increasing dose and was approx. 240 ml/day/kg at the 100 µg/kg 
dose level; AUC0-last values increased with dose. Vc ranged between 25 and 40 ml/kg, i.e. in the 
range of the reported plasma volume in cynomolgus (33-37 ml/kg). Vss values are slightly higher, 
indicating some distribution of glofitamab into tissues. Of note, t1/2 was rather short, less than 5 hrs. 
Prior B cell depletion by obinutuzumab (4 days prior to administration of glofitamab), reduced 
glofitamab clearance (approx. 4.7x) and prolonged the half-life (9x) when compared to glofitamab 
treatment without prior B cell depletion. Nevertheless, even in B cell-depleted cynomolgus, the 
glofitamab t1/2 ranged from 53.4 to 67.7 hrs (2.2 to 2.8 days) which is rather short for a mAb.  
The toxicity findings based on the single- and repeat dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys for up to 4 
weeks showed extensive CRS-related effects, which was expected based on the mode of action of 
glofitamab. Some of the CRS-related effects were diminished using pre-treatment and step-up dosing, 
and higher dosing was allowed using these approaches, but CRS-related toxicity findings and ADA 
formation could not be alleviated completely. Studies of longer duration could not be completed, due to 
ADA formation leading to low exposures and affecting the PD effect in animals. This is considered 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 37/158 
 
 
 
acceptable as no unexpected findings were observed in the toxicity studies for up to 4 weeks. The 
repeat-dose toxicity studies were GLP-compliant, while the single-dose studies were not. This is 
acceptable. Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were waived due to the known effect on 
B-cell depletion and potential infections as well as acute toxicities following cytokine release, which 
may result in increased risk of neonatal loss. No further studies are considered warranted to inform on 
the safety issues during pregnancy.  
The potential of glofitamab for off-target binding was evaluated in a tissue cross-reactivity study. The 
observed membrane staining of mononuclear cells in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues was as 
expected. Due to technical limitations of immunohistochemistry methods used in TCR studies the lack 
of staining of blood and bone marrow samples in the assay is acceptable.  
Lastly, in a PD study in humanised NSG mice, glofitamab was administered in combination with a 
second bi-specific mAb (not relevant for the present submission) with and without obinutuzumab pre-
treatment. The study was reported in the toxicology section due to histological findings in bone marrow 
(necrosis/atrophy) which had not been observed in cynomolgus monkey studies. The applicant 
considers the bone marrow findings largely related to the murine/human chimerism. An additional 
study in tumour-bearing humanised NSG mice treated with glofitamab or glofitamab plus another 
compound in presence or absence of obinutuzumab pre-treatment conducted by the applicant 
supported this conclusion. Importantly, no effects on bone marrow were observed in cynomolgus 
monkey toxicity studies with glofitamab nor in humans.  
Overall, the non-clinical safety and efficacy profile seems well documented in the submitted non-
clinical dossier, which supports the findings in the clinic. The identified non-clinical risks have been 
discussed regarding human relevance and follow-up measures in patients have been proposed as 
relevant. 
The pharmacokinetics of glofitamab was overall adequately characterized in the provided nonclinical 
package. However, a high incidence of ADA was observed in both single-dose and repeat-dose studies 
conducted with and without Gpt in monkeys. For the pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies, the 
presence of ADA compromised the ability to maintain exposure levels above (or at) those obtained in 
the clinical setting. Waivers for omission of additional toxicological studies of longer duration in 
monkeys were granted by the EMA and FDA, and no other relevant animal species were available. This 
was considered acceptable taking into account the indication (advanced cancer); and that the expected 
adverse effects of glofitamab consist of pharmacology, which is well-known for other antibodies in this 
class.  
Toxicology was investigated sufficiently in cynomolgus monkey. In brief, several signals were detected 
that were considered relevant for translation to human administration, i.e. toxicities observed 
secondary to B-cell depletion and cytokine-release syndrome. The effects observed in the nonclinical 
studies are known in the clinic and guidance has been included in the RMP for addressing the findings.  
A justification for not submitting ERA studies, due to the nature of the active substance – is acceptable 
in accordance with EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447 as glofitamab is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment.   
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The in vitro and in vivo pharmacology programme, including in disease models, supporting the 
intended clinical use of glofitamab – is sufficient. Nonclinical proof of concept as an anti-CD20/CD3 T-
cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) antibody mediating target B-cell lymphoma killing appears well-

established. Relevant information has been included in SmPC sections 5.3. and appropriate warnings in 
section 4.6.  
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Union 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Table 3 Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
The PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity results were all derived from Study NP30179. 
Study NP30179 is an ongoing Phase I/II, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a novel TCB antibody, glofitamab, 
administered by IV infusion as a single agent and in combination with obinutuzumab following pre-
treatment with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab in patients with R/R NHL. 
The study is divided in three parts (i.e., dose escalation (Parts I [single patient cohorts] and II 
[multiple patient cohorts]) and dose expansion [Part III]). 
Note that for statistical and PK analyses purposes presented in this document, obinutuzumab pre-
treatment (Gpt) administered 7 days prior to the initial dose of glofitamab (i.e., Day 7) as described in 
the study protocol corresponds to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). Consequently, in the analyses, the first dose 
of glofitamab corresponds to C1D8 and for patients receiving the step-up dosing regimen, 
administration of the initial low dose of glofitamab (2.5 mg) 7 days after Gpt corresponds to C1D8 
(Day 8) and administration of the intermediate 10 mg glofitamab dose 7 days after the first glofitamab 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 40/158 
 
 
 
 
 
dose corresponds to C1D15 (Day 15). Thus, the cycles and days of administration of Gpt and 
glofitamab presented henceforth in this document follows the convention noted above. 
The proposed registrational dose of glofitamab treatment is 2.5 mg C1D8, 10 mg C1D15 and 30 mg 
Day 1 of Cycle 2-12, with obinutuzumab 1000 mg pre-treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
In study NP30179, glofitamab (RO7082859) was administered either alone or concomitantly with 
obinutuzumab (RO5072759). Both analytes were quantified by validated ELISA assay. Immunogenicity 
of glofitamab was evaluated by validated ADA assay using a rabbit polyclonal IgG directed against the 
CD20 binding domain of glofitamab as positive control. An ELISA method was also validated for 
determination of tocilizumab. Commercially available immunoassay kits were used for determination of 
IL-6 and IL-6sR levels in human serum samples from Study NP30179. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Non-compartmental analysis was used to estimate glofitamab PK parameters using Phoenix WinNonlin 
8.2 software. Population PK/PD model fitting and Bayesian feedback were performed using the non-
linear mixed effect modelling software NONMEM, version 7.4.3 and FOCEI. R version 4.0.5 was used 
for data processing, data visualization and reporting. Simulations were performed using a combination 
of NONMEM and R. PBPK modelling of cytokine release kinetics was performed using the Simcyp 
Population-Based Simulator (Version 20). 
Glofitamab Population PK 
The glofitamab population PK analysis was based on a dataset from Study NP30179 in which doses of 
glofitamab monotherapy cohorts ranged from 5 µg to 30 mg. The final population PK model for 
glofitamab was two-compartmental with parallel linear and time varying clearance. Inter-individual 
variability was included on all structural parameters, and a proportional residual variability model was 
used. The following covariates were identified as statistically significant and included in the final model: 
body weight on clearances and volumes, baseline CRP on clearances and V1, baseline obinutuzumab 
pre-treatment concentration on time-dependent CL and transformed follicular lymphoma histology 
(trFL) on decay constant (Kdes). The effect of body weight was allometrically scaled with fixed 
exponents of 0.75 for clearances and 1 for V2 while the exponent of V1 was estimated to 0.505, 
indicating that the effect of body weight was less than proportional. 
Parameter estimates of the final model for glofitamab and selected diagnostic plots are shown in Table 
1 and Figures 19 and 21.

Glofitamab Logistic Regression analysis 
Exposure-response relationships of glofitamab for efficacy and safety were characterized by logistic 
regression modelling, including an assessment of covariate effects. For efficacy, patients were split into 
two populations from Study NP30179: (1) the 2.5/10/30 mg glofitamab step-up dosing of DLBCL/trFL 
patients enrolled in Cohort D3 (n = 95) and (2) patients with DLBCL/HGBCL/PMBCL/trFL administered a 
wider range of glofitamab doses (n = 259). No exposure-efficacy relationship was found for the 
2.5/10/30 mg step-up dosing regimen of Cohort D3 but in the DLBCL/HGBCL/PMBCL/trFL population a 
significant relationship was found for AUCC1+C2 for both CRR and ORR. In both populations, CRR was 
significantly associated with decreasing baseline sum of product diameters and increasing time since 
last prior anti-CD20 treatment. ORR was significantly associated with decreasing baseline lactate 
dehydrogenase and increasing time since last prior anti-CD20 treatment. An exposure-safety 
relationship was found for CRS (Grade ≥2) as the incidence was significantly associated with increasing 
AvgRO%D1 but no significant effect of glofitamab exposure was found for neutropenia (Grade ≥2).  
QTc modelling analysis 
The glofitamab concentration-QT interval relationship was characterized by mixed-effects modelling. 
The QT prolongation signal associated with glofitamab concentration was best described by an Emax 
model in which maximal prolongation was estimated to be 10.6 ms (95% CI 9.29-11.8%), with an 
associated glofitamab concentration to give the half-maximal effect (EC50) of 1.25 μg/mL (95% CI 
1.11-1.39 μg/mL). Based on this model, the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval of the mean 
concentration change in individually-corrected QT interval from baseline (ΔQTcI) relationship was 
estimated to reach the 10 ms threshold of concern at a glofitamab concentration of 7.27 μg/mL and in 
the observed population receiving 2.5/10/30 mg glofitamab the upper limit of the 90% confidence 
interval was reached in 71.6% of patients. 
PBPK modelling of IL-6 release 
The MoA of glofitamab results in a transient elevation of cytokines, mainly IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-c. IL-6 
is a potent suppressor of CYP-mediated metabolism in-vitro. A literature based PBPK model was used 
to reflect the IL-6 kinetics induced by glofitamab following the 2.5/10/30mg step-up dosing applied in 
CHMP assessment report

the NP30179 study. The IL-6 PBPK model was used to assess the level of suppression of CYP3A4, 
CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 caused by the transient IL-6 release and assess the potential impact on 
substrates of these CYPs. 
A minimal PBPK model using the Simcyp population-based simulator was applied in simulations of 
plasma concentrations of IL-6. A number of simulations were run to achieve different profiles of plasma 
IL-6 concentrations (i.e. high, median and low IL-6 increase profiles) which encompass the observed 
IL-6 levels in the patients in NP30179. Based on the observed profiles in the 163 glofitamab step-up 
dosing patients with IL-6 peak at approximately 12h post-glofitamab dose, IL-6 was introduced as a 
12-h i.v. infusion at a dose of 0.0002, 0.004 and 0.04 mg to capture the low, medium and high IL-6 
increase profiles. The parameters used for the IL-6 compound file for simulation of IL-6 
pharmacokinetics are shown below. 
Table 5 Input parameter values used for IL-6 
PBPK predictions were performed using the virtual North European Caucasian population with age, 
body weight and gender characteristics matching the 163 patients from the NP30179 study with 
available IL-6 concentrations (6th July PK cut-off). The median (5th -95th percentiles) predicted 
plasma concentration-time profiles for IL-6 following administration of intravenous infusion doses of IL-
6 at 0.0002, 0.004 and 0.04 mg weekly were overlaid to the observed IL-6 concentrations from the 
patients who did not receive tocilizumab (n=124) (Figure 2).

Mean glofitamab concentrations increased rapidly with the median time to maximum concentration 
(tmax) reached shortly after end of infusion as expected for a monoclonal antibody. The geometric 
means of volume of distribution from NCA (Vz) ranged from 3.49 to 9.91 L. Due to the sampling 
schedule, it was not possible to report pharmacokinetic parameters for all cohorts by NCA and 
population PK modelling has been used to further characterize the PK properties of glofitamab. 
The central volume of distribution (V1) was 3.33 L and peripheral volume of distribution (V2) was 2.18 
L. The central volume of distribution of 3.33 L is close to total serum volume.

The glofitamab serum concentration-time data are described by a population pharmacokinetic model 
with two compartments, and both time-independent clearance and time-varying clearance. 
The time-independent clearance pathway was estimated as 0.602 L/day and the initial time-varying 
clearance pathway as 0.396 L/day, with an exponential decay over time (Kdes ~ 0.445/day). The 
estimated decay half-life from the initial total clearance value to the time-independent clearance only 
was estimated as 1.56 days. 
The effective half-life in the linear phase (i.e., after the contribution of time-varying clearance has 
collapsed to a negligible amount) can be approximated to a typical linear effective half-life of 6.54 days 
(95% CI: 3.74 - 9.41) based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis.    
The expected consequence of metabolism of biological products is degradation to small peptides and 
amino acids. Glofitamab is as a MAB not cleared renally due to its large molecular weight. The primary 
elimination pathways are protein catabolism via the reticuloendothelial system (RES) or target-
mediated disposition. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The mean Cycle 1 Cmax values following first administration were dose proportional from 0.015 to 25 
mg. All Cycle 1 concentrations in the single patient who received 0.005 mg were below the limit of 
quantification

Special populations 
The effect of renal impairment on glofitamab PK was investigated in the Population PK model based on 
creatinine clearance (CrCL) values in PK-evaluable monotherapy patients from Study NP30179. Among 
the 399 patients, 195 patients (48.9%) had normal renal function at baseline, 141 patients (35.3%) 
had mild renal impairment, 62 patients (15.5%) had moderate renal impairment, and 1 patient 
(0.25%) had severe renal impairment. The results indicate that CrCL did not affect glofitamab PK.  
The effect of hepatic impairment on glofitamab PK was investigated in the Population PK model. From 
the 399 PK-evaluable patients, 347 had normal hepatic function, 48 had mild impaired function, 2 had 
moderate impaired function, 1 has strong hepatic impaired function and the information about hepatic 
function was unavailable for 1 patient.  
Despite very limited data with moderate to strong hepatic impairment, no relationships were observed 
between hepatic impairment and clearances in the final reduced population PK model for glofitamab.  
The effect of NHL histology on glofitamab PK was investigated as a categorical covariate in the 
population PK model based on monotherapy patients in Study NP30179. The results indicate a 
significant relationship between trFL versus other histologies and the decay constant Kdes of the time-
varying clearance. Kdes was 4.76-fold higher in trFL versus non-trFL patients, reflecting a 4.76-fold 
shorter half-life of the transition from the initial total clearance value (i.e., sum of CLL and CLT0) to the 
linear clearance only CLL. 
When considering the population PK model estimates, the estimated AUCD1 and AUCC1+C2 were very 
close in a trFL patient as compared to a non-trFL patient (i.e., 1.91% and 0.807% higher, 
respectively), suggesting that despite a statistically significant improvement of the population PK 
model fit when including the histology-Kdes relationship, there was a minor impact on the estimated 
exposures. 
Gender was assessed during the covariate screening step on all the population PK model parameters. 
However, gender was not retained in the final reduced population PK model following the backward 
elimination process. 
The ER analysis of both efficacy and safety of glofitamab did not suggest any significant relationship 
between CRR, ORR or the occurrence of Grade ≥2 CRS and gender. 
The glofitamab population PK analysis dataset included 320 (80.2%) White, 3 (0.752%) Black or 
African American, 16 (4.04%) Asian and 60 (15%) other/unknown race patients. Differences relating 
to Black/African American or Asian race could not be tested in the covariate screening steps for both 
population PK and ER analyses owing to a lack of data. 
The effect of body weight on glofitamab PK was investigated in the population PK model based on 
monotherapy patients in Study NP30179. Among the 399 patients included in the analysis, the median 
body weight is 74.3 kg with range of 31 kg to 148 kg. 
The variation in body weight resulted in a -18.7% up to +28.0% of the AUCD1 and in a -24.4% up to 
+39.5% of the AUCC1+C2 in the higher (i.e., 107 kg) and lower (i.e., 47.5 kg) limits of the 2.5th to 
97.5th body weight range, respectively, as compared to the median value (74.0 kg), when considering 
the PopPK model estimates. 
The population PK model estimated PK exposures over the first day (AUCD1) or over the first 2 cycles 
(AUCC1+C2) following administration of the intended registration dose and schedule of 2.5/10/30 mg, 
across the body weight quartiles for all patients in the population PK analysis (Q1 to Q4) showed that 
heavier patients had lower exposure due to fixed dosing. However, the 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles of 
exposures are greatly overlapping across the body weight quantiles. At the intended registration dose 
CHMP assessment report

and schedule of 2.5/10/30 mg step-up dosing regimen, the simulated glofitamab PK exposure (median 
[95%CI]) over the first 2 cycles (AUCC1+C2) were 75.3 µg/mL•day (5.16-119), 57.0 µg/mL•day 
(3.59-97.7), 55.2 µg/mL•day (3.32-82.5) and 48.7 µg/mL•day (2.96-71.2) for the body weight group 
of (44.4, 67.0) (N=43), (67.0, 75.0) (N=47), (75.0, 85.0) (N=37) and (85.0,133) (N=42), 
respectively. 
The effect of age on glofitamab PK was investigated as a potential continuous covariate in the 
population PK model based on monotherapy patients of Study NP30179. The results showed that age 
had no statistically significant impact on the glofitamab PK parameters. The associated p-value when 
assessing the baseline age on CLL, CLTL0, V1, V2 and Q were 0.469, 0.842, 0.780, 0.523 and 0.888, 
respectively.

The ER analysis of CRS of glofitamab did not suggest any significant relationship between occurrence 
of Grade ≥2 CRS and the baseline age used as a continuous covariate (from 21 to 90 years). Similarly, 
in the ER analyses of efficacy, the covariate screening did not reveal a significant relationship between 
CRR or ORR and baseline age used as a continuous covariate.  
Immunogenicity 
As of the PK and ADA data cutoff date of the 18 April 2022, a total of 442 patients were evaluable for 
immunogenicity assessment with a baseline sample and at least one post dose sample. The majority 
(94.6%) of 418 ADA-evaluable patients who received glofitamab monotherapy were negative for ADAs 
at baseline and remained negative on treatment in Study NP30179. Two patients (0.5%) that were 
negative at baseline, developed ADAs while on study, one at the end of treatment visit, and the other 
at a follow up visit of 12 months. Both patients had a complete remission and continued to be in 
complete response beyond the timepoint of positive ADAs. 
Therefore, there is no evidence to indicate formation of neutralizing antibodies as a theoretical mode of 
tolerance or resistance to therapy.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No DDI study was performed. 
PBPK modeling was performed to estimate the magnitude of potential drug interactions caused by the 
transient increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels during the first cycle of glofitamab treatment with step-
up dosing. 
Data suggests that the main impact of the highest observed transient increase in IL-6 levels (>1000 
pg/mL) following glofitamab administration would be to increase by a factor up to two fold the 
exposure of drugs predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 enzyme (i.e., simvastatin and midazolam). 
This level of IL-6 increase was observed in a very limited number of patients in Study NP30179. This 
predicted impact was expected as among all the CYP, CYP3A4 had in vitro the highest susceptibility to 
the CYP activity reduction by IL-6 (Dickmann et al. 2011). Since simvastatin and midazolam are 
CHMP assessment report

sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, the effect of IL-6 on less-sensitive CYP3A4 substrates is expected to be 
lower.  
This suggests that the magnitude of the suppressive effect of transient IL-6 increase on hepatic CYP 
enzyme activities is <50%. In addition, the changes in exposures to substrates of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, 
and CYP2C9 are expected to be lower than or equal to twofold in the worst-case scenario and the 
magnitude of CYP suppression is dependent on the duration of cytokine elevation. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Glofitamab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that binds bivalently to CD20 expressed on the surface 
of B cells and monovalently to CD3 in the T-cell receptor complex expressed on the surface of T cells. 
By simultaneous binding to CD20 on the B cell and CD3 on the T cell, glofitamab mediates the 
formation of a synapse with subsequent T-cell activation and proliferation, secretion of cytokines and 
release of cytolytic proteins that results in the lysis of CD20-expressing B cells. 
Figure 9

2:1=“2:1” molecular format denoting 2 Fab domains binding to CD20 and 1 Fab domain binding  to 
CD3; CD3ε=CD3 epsilon subunit; Fab=fragment antigen-binding; TCB=T-cell bispecific. 
Notes: Glofitamab (CD20-TCB) simultaneously binds to CD3ε expressed on T cells and CD20 
expressed on B cells. CD3 cross-linking results in T-cell activation and cytokine and cytotoxic 
granule release, and ultimately leads to tumor cell killing. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Obinutuzumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which is approved for the treatment of untreated 
chronic lymphocytic leaukemia, R/R FL and untreated FL. All patients were pre-treated with 
obinutuzumab 1000 mg 7 days prior to treatment with glofitamab.  
Glofitamab and obinutuzumab both bind to CD20 on the same epitope, and the high concentrations of 
circulating obinutuzumab will compete with glofitamab. Interim ER analysis prior to the 6th July 2021

PK cut off have been conducted, and were used to identify suitable dosing regimens for Part III (Djebli 
et al 2019, Djebli et al 2020). The PK exposure parameter utilized in these analyses was glofitamab 
receptor occupancy (RO). 
The relationship between IRC-assessed clinical objective response (CRR or ORR) and the population PK 
estimated cumulative glofitamab AUC over the first and second cycles (AUCC1+C2) was determined by a 
logistic regression model. The results of the final ER efficacy modeling are shown below.

From the exposure-QTc modeling analysis, a Maximum Effect (Emax) model fitted the data well for 
predicted glofitamab concentrations (obtained from the population PK model) versus the observed QT 
prolongation.  
The model estimated an Emax value of 10.6 ms. Based on this model, the upper limit of the 90%CI 
around the QT prolongation effect crosses the 10 ms boundary at a concentration of 7.27 μg/mL of 
gloftamab). Given the nature of the Emax model, the QTc prolongation will tend to reach the value of 
10.6 ms at higher concentrations (i.e., typical value of QTc prolongation is not expected to be higher 
than 10.6 ms at highest concentrations based on the Emax model). 
The model shows that median [95%CI] predicted Cmax following the target 30 mg dose is 9.17 
[0.637;15.9] µg/mL suggesting that 71.6% of the patient receiving 2.5/10/30 mg step-up dosing 
crossed the 7.27 µg/mL value following the first 30 mg dose (i.e., 121/169 patients) however, without 
translating in an association with cardiac events.  
Simulations suggested that 23.0% of subjects might be expected to exceed 20 ms on this regimen. A 
total of 12.8% of simulated patients were predicted to exceed an absolute QTc level of 450 msec, but 
less than 1% were predicted to exceed 480 msec. 
Although the model suggested a potential relationship between a QT prolongation and glofitamab 
exposures, this prolongation was estimated to plateau at just above 10 ms in the typical patient. The 
analysis had however several limitations. 
Based on the updated cut-off date (15 June 2022), the applicant reviewed all cases of 16 patients 
where a prolongation Fredericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF)> 450 msec was reported in the primary 
safety population. Of the patients who experienced a prolonged QTcF, six of these were observed at 
the 30mg dose.  
2 patients (1.4%) had post-baseline QTcF values ≥ 500 ms.  
The ER analyses indicate that clinical responses including complete response rate (CRR) and overall 
response rate (ORR) significantly increase (p-value 3.59x10-6 and 1.40 x10-6, respectively) with 
increasing glofitamab exposure for all histologies. 
Glofitamab exposure was defined as the total AUC for cycles 1 and 2 (AUCC1+C2) when the total 
NP30179 R/R DLBCL population including the complete dose range explored in the study (0.005 – 30 
mg) was analyzed. This observation was confirmed when considering the glofitamab exposure 
(AUCC1+C2) in tertiles with 23.3%, 31.0% and 51.2% of CRR in AUCC1+C2 in tertiles 1, 2 and 3, 
respectively. 
Similarly, the observed ORR was 38.4%, 44.8% and 67.4% in tertiles 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 
When focusing only on the exposure response analysis using the efficacy from Cohort D3, which 
utilized step-up dosing (2.5/10/30 mg), results demonstrated a shallower relationship between 
glofitamab exposure and the clinical response (p-value =0.0327 for CRR and 5.33 x10-4 for ORR) in 
patients with R/R DLBCL.  
The ER relationships for safety were assessed on 399 PK-evaluable patients with R/R NHL receiving IV 
administration of glofitamab from Study NP30179. 
Dosing of glofitamab following the 2.5/10/30 mg step-up dosing regimen is associated with an 
incidence of Grade ≥2 CRS (by American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy [ASTCT]) of 
16.4% across all cycles in the safety population (n=152) and an incidence of 12.7% following the first 
dose of 2.5 mg. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 54/158 
 
 
 
The exposure-CRS analysis on the total PK-evaluable population of 399 patients (covering a wide range 
of exposures and dosing regimens), with starting doses over a 5,000-fold range from 0.005 mg to 25 
mg, indicates that the risk of experiencing CRS Grade ≥2 significantly increases (p-value = 0.00380) 
with increasing glofitamab average RO% over the first 24 hours after the first dose (AvRO%D1). This 
observation was confirmed when looking at the AvRO%D1 quartiles with 20.6%, 24.8%, 18.8% and 
35.6% in quartiles 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 
The exposure-neutropenia analysis on the total PK-evaluable patient population, indicates the absence 
of any relationship between glofitamab exposure and the incidence of Grade ≥2 neutropenia (p-value 
of 0.711 for AUCC1+C2 and 0.364 for AvRO%C1+C2). 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity results were all derived from Study NP30179 
which was conducted in patients with R/R NHL, R/R DLBCL and R/R FL. Hence PK data are expected to 
represent the target population. 
A total of 399 patients (221 in Part I and II, and 178 in Part III) who had at least 1 post dose 
quantifiable glofitamab PK sample were included in the PK analysis. The data base with 399 patients is 
rather small but is considered to be sufficient. The clinical pharmacology characterization is based on 
various dose steps, dosing regimens, pre-treatments and subgroups of disease (Cohorts A1 and A2 
(Fixed dosing 0.005-10 mg, Q2W, N=75); Cohorts B2, B3, and B4 (Fixed dosing 0.6-25 mg, Q3W, 
N=109) and Cohorts D2 [Sub. 1] (step-up dosing 2.5/10/16 mg, Q3W, N=16), D2 [Sub. 2 and Sub. 
4], D3, D4 and D5 (2.5/10/30 mg, Q3W, N=169) and F2 (extended step-up dosing 0.5/2.5/10/30 mg, 
Q3W, N=30)).  
Bioanalysis of glofitamab, obinutuzumab and tocilizumab were conducted using validated ELISA 
assays. ADAs against glofitamab were detected using validated ELISA assays, with appropriate level of 
drug tolerance. No NAb analyses were conducted. However, in case that nAbs are suspected in 
future/during the study, i.e. reduced drug exposure detected for ADA-positive individuals, the 
development of a separate NAb assay should be considered. Glofitamab can undergo post-translational 
modifications by deamidation and/or Fab glycosylation and thus escape detection by the quantitative 
assay. The extent could potentially be up to 45% of the drug still in circulation within a treatment cycle 
of 21 days with the biologically active N106 deamidation contributing about 30%. Commercially 
available immunoassay kits were validated for determination of IL-6 and IL-6sR levels in human serum 
samples from Study NP30179. Final reports covering bioanalysis in Study NP30179 should be provided, 
as recommended by the CHMP. 
Glofitamab concentration-QT interval relationship was investigated using mixed-effects modelling and 
the results suggested the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval of the mean concentration-ΔQTcI 
relationship was estimated to reach the 10 ms threshold of concern at a glofitamab concentration of 
7.27 μg/mL. However, severe deficiencies in the underlying data significantly limited the analysis of 
the concentration-QT relationship and its conclusions should be interpreted with caution. It is possible 
that the actual concentration-QT relationship for glofitamab may be stronger or weaker than 
estimated. 
A literature based PBPK model was used to reflect the IL-6 kinetics induced by glofitamab and predict 
the worst-case scenarios for drug interactions mediated by the transient increase in IL-6 during Cycle 
1. A dedicated drug interaction study in patients was not conducted. The PBPK model for IL-6 is not 
considered qualified according to the EMA PBPK Guideline. The predictions were used to support a 
recommendation for close observation of patients being treated with medications with a narrow 
therapeutic index during Cycle 1.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 55/158 
 
 
 
No plasma protein binding or tissue distribution study was performed and the metabolic pathways of 
glofitamab have not been investigated. This is acceptable for an IgG antibody (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Glofitamab exhibits linear and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in the dose range studied (0.005 to 
30 mg) and is independent of time. As a monoclonal antibody its pharmacokinetics are not expected to 
be impacted by renal or hepatic impairment which was supported by the population PK model. 
Although, population PK modeling based on Study NP30179 in 253 men (63.4%) and 146 women 
(36.6%) indicates no clinically meaningful effect of gender on glofitamab pharmacokinetics, comparing 
male patients with female patients in the primary safety population, a slightly higher incidence of 
deaths (41.0% vs. 34.6%), fatal AEs (6.0% vs. 1.9%), AEs leading to withdrawal from study drug 
(10.0% vs. 3.8%), and CRS (by ASTCT 2019) (64.0% vs. 57.7%) were reported. A significant 
relationship between trFL versus other histologies and Kdes was seen (~5-fold higher Kdes in trFL 
versus non-trFL patients). However, glofitamab exposures were similar between all histologies. Body 
weight impacted PK, AUCD1 was -18.7% to +28.0% and AUCC1+2 -24.4% to +39.5% of the AUCC1+C2 
for a 107 and 47.5 kg patient respectively compared to the median 74.0 kg subject. However, as 
exposures overlap greatly across body weight quartiles, and coupled with the absence of impact of 
body weight in exposure-response models of efficacy and safety, it can be agreed that no dose 
adjustments may be needed based on body weight. No dedicated DDI studies were conducted, PBPK 
modeling was used to generate estimations on IL-6 caused CYP suppression. This is acceptable, as no 
other CYP or transporter mediated DD is expected for monoclonal antibodies. However, a warning has 
been introduced in section 4.4 of the SmPC to raise clinicians’ awareness on the possibility of IL-6 
caused CYP suppression derived interactions. 
The mechanism of action is sufficiently described and plausible. Primary pharmacology was shown by 
receptor occupancy.  
There is no substance specific or class effect suspected to cause QTc prolongation. However, based on 
the updated data (CCOD: 15 June 2022) a prolongation of the Fredericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF)> 
450 ms was reported in 16 subjects and over ≥ 500 ms in 2 subjects. The applicant reviewed all and 
considers no association has been observed between adverse clinical outcomes and QTcF over 450 
msecs. The occurred QTc prolongation/results on cardiac electrophysiology are reflected in section 5.1 
“Pharmacodynamic effects” of the SmPC to inform prescribers and patients. Currently, there is no clear 
clinical evidence that the mechanism of action of glofitamab results in QT prolongation with a cardiac 
event, but 16  patients in the primary safety population experienced a prolonged QTcF > 450 msec. 
Fifteen of the 16 patients experiencing these QT prolongations were noted to have concomitant 
medications that are potential confounding factors for post-baseline QTcF values > 450 ms and no 
recurrence of QTcF prolongation were noted after subsequent doses of glofitamab. Therefore, it is 
considered to be acceptable, that concomitant medication restrictions are not warranted with 
glofitamab administration. Efficacy-Response relationship was shown by clinical responses including 
complete response rate (CRR) and overall response rate (ORR) significantly increasing with increasing 
glofitamab exposure for all histologies. Given the lack of a dose-finding study and the limitations of the 
applied simulations, there remains some uncertainty that the chosen 2.5/10/30mg dose is the optimal 
one with regards to both, efficacy and safety. However, the 2.5/10/30mg dose regimen is the only one 
with an adequate size of efficacy and safety data base and based on the provided efficacy and safety 
data it seems that 2.5/10/30 mg is appropriate to treat patients with R/R DLBCL with ≥2 prior lines of 
therapy, as the risks seems to be manageable and efficacy has been demonstrated. Therefore, the 
proposed dosing regimen of 2.5/10/30 mg may be acceptable. Safety-Response relationship was 
shown for CRS, significantly increasing with increasing glofitamab average RO% over the first 24 hours 
after the first dose. No Safety-response relationship was seen for neutropenia. 
Based on the original presentation of the ER-Analysis for safety the risk of experiencing CRS Grade ≥2 
for patients treated with the dosing regimen 2.5/10/30 mg was mostly between the AvRO%D1 quartile 
CHMP assessment report

1 and 3. However, because the individual dose regimens could not be clearly identified based on the 
original presentation, the applicant was requested to provide the percentage of patients for each 
dosing regimen per each quartile and additionally per starting dose. Based on this representation of 
the ER-Analysis data for safety provided the risk of experiencing CRS Grade≥2 for patients treated with 
the dosing regimen 2.5/10/30 mg were mostly within the AvRO%D1 quartile 2 (n=77 [76.2%]) and 
quartile 3 (n=80 [79.2%]). The highest dose studied during the dose escalation studies was 25mg; 
step-up dosing was selected to start at a low dose and increase with subsequent dose to mitigate the 
risk of CRS at early doses and to enable a higher target dose to be reached. The 30 mg dose was 
selected based on the ER modelling to maximise the potential for efficacy. Glofitmab is a bispecific 
antibody and thus binding to CD3 and CD20; it has only a monovalent binding to CD3 with low affinity 
and will bind with considerably more efficiency to B cells compared to T cells when administered to 
patients. However, receptor occupancy of CD3 has not been estimated.   
The population pharmacokinetic analysis of glofitamab showed that creatinine clearance does not affect 
the pharmacokinetics of glofitamab. The pharmacokinetics of glofitamab in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30 to < 90 mL/min) were similar to those in patients with normal 
renal function. Columvi has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment.  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed mild hepatic impairment does not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of glofitamab. The pharmacokinetics of glofitamab in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin > ULN to ≤ 1.5 × ULN or AST > ULN) were similar to those with normal 
hepatic functions. Columvi has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment. 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of glofitamab were observed based on age 
(21 years to 90 years), gender and body weight (31 kg to 148 kg). 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of glofitamab was overall sufficiently described. Relevant information has 
been included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
In accordance with the CHMP recommendations, the applicant commits to submitting the final CSR for 
StudyNP30179 at the end of the study (LPLV per protocol) together with the final incremental BARs. 
For any additional interim CSRs/BARs produced prior to the final CSR that may not have been 
submitted to the EMA, these will be sent at the time of the final CSR. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No stand-alone dose-finding study was conducted. Exposure-response analyses on basis of the dose 
escalation cohorts of Study NP30179 were used to find the highest possible efficacious and 
simultaneously most safe dose, resulting in a step-up approach.  
Initial exposure-response analyses indicated that a dose of 30 mg glofitamab was required to 
maximize clinical response. However, administration of 25 mg as a fixed dose resulted in high rates of 
CRS, making this an unsuitable dose to administer at treatment initiation. 
Consequently, there was a decoupling of the exposure-CRS and exposure-efficacy relationships, and a 
step-up dosing regimen was recommended with an initial starting dose of 2.5 mg glofitamab to 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 57/158 
 
 
 
mitigate CRS, with a rapid step up to the required target dose of 30 mg to maximize the potential for 
efficacy. 
Although 2.5/10/30 mg Q3W with single obinutuzumab administration is sought for approval, it is 
noted that still, double dose obinutuzumab pre-treatment as well as three-step dose ascending 
regimen is being investigated. In response to the possible risk that the pretreatment/dosing/schedule 
is not considered final, the applicant has confirmed that no further investigations of the glofitamab 
dose, dosing regimen, or the steroid pre-medication or Gpt are ongoing for patients with R/R DLBCL 
who have received ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy. 
Moreover, the applicant claims that the 4-step-up dosing is problematic, because it appears not to 
have reduced the overall Grade 2 and more CRS incidence and prolongs the timespan to final dose. 
As to pretreatment with double dose obinutuzumab in MCL the rationale is disease –specific. Patients 
with MCL have an initial 2-fold higher clearance of obinutuzumab than patients with DLBCL and other 
histologies (Gibiansky et al. 2014). This translates to a higher glofitamab receptor occupancy with 
1000 mg Gpt. Therefore, 2000 mg Gpt is being tested as pretreatment for R/R MCL patients only. 
Finally, CHMP confirms that the 4 step up and double obinutuzumab pretreatment was triggered by 
specific histology of entities other than DLBCL. Therefore, it is agreed that the requested dose and 
regimen may be considered final for the target population and mature enough for approval. 
Drug exposure 
Additionally, an issue for drug exposure has been identified: Per Study Protocol, glofitamab 
monotherapy was initially given as 8 cycles, with the option to give another 4 cycles (a total of 12) if 
this was considered in the best interest of the patient. From Study Protocol, Version 9, the treatment 
period was fixed at 12 cycles. All patients in Cohort D3 were enrolled to have the fixed treatment 
period of 12 cycles.  
With a fixed treatment duration of 12 cycles (approximately 8.3 months) and the majority of CRs 
achieved early on during the treatment (median 42 days), up to approximately 7 months CR follow-up 
occurs while a patient receives glofitamab treatment. Therefore, the current median DOCR follow up of 
12.8 months in Cohort D3 and a 12-month event free rate of 74.6% clearly demonstrate that 
glofitamab responses are maintained beyond the end of treatment. The longest CR follow-up in Cohort 
D3 was 20 months which is at least 12 months while being off treatment. Additionally, patient 
convenience and safety are important considerations for limiting treatment to 12 cycles in the target 
population, given the durable responses observed. 
Study Design 
Study NP30179 is an ongoing Phase I/II, multicenter, open-label, dose expansion and dose escalation 
study of glofitamab administered as monotherapy and in combination with obinutuzumab administered 
after a fixed, single dose pre-treatment with obinutuzumab in patients with R/R B-cell NHL. 
This entry into human study consists of three parts (see Figure 1).  
Part I, dose escalation (single-patient cohorts: glofitamab fixed doses 0.005 – 0.045 mg) and  
Part II dose escalation (multiple patient cohorts: glofitamab fixed doses of 0.015 - 25 mg and 
step-up-doses up to 30 mg) in patients with R/R NHL (mixed histologies), and  
Part III dose expansion cohorts in patients with R/R DLBCL or R/R FL treated with glofitamab 
at 10/16 mg or 2.5/10/30 mg step-up dosing.

MTD 
CHMP assessment report

Page 58/158 
 
 
 
The dose-escalation cohorts (Parts I and II) were designed to ensure patient safety while minimizing 
the number of patients exposed to sub-therapeutic doses of glofitamab.  
Single-patient dose-escalation cohorts were used in Part I, followed by multiple-patient dose-escalation 
cohorts in Part II to define a tentative maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose 
(OBD). The modified data-augmentation continual reassessment method of escalation with overdose 
control (mDA CRM EWOC) was used to guide dose-escalation to determine the MTD. In addition, Part II 
dose escalation explored step-up-dosing regimens. 
The dose expansion cohorts (Part III) were initiated when the MTD/OBD was defined to further 
evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and therapeutic activity of glofitamab when given as a single 
agent.  
The final MTD/OBD was estimated based on an analysis of the data for all patients evaluable for dose-
limiting toxicities (DLTs) in parts I and II of the study. Dosing regimen of glofitamab 10 mg on Cycle 
(C)1Day (D)8 (2-week cycle) and glofitamab 16 mg on C2D1 and subsequent three-week cycles 
(10/16 mg, Q3W) was chosen for the Part III expansion cohorts. Although 10/16 mg has been 
suggested for Part III, following a Grade 4 CRS event in a patient enrolled to receive 10/16 mg 
glofitamab in combination with obinutuzumab in the Part II dose escalation multiple patient cohorts 
(data from obinutuzumab combination cohorts are not reported in this CSR), a step-up dosing regimen 
was introduced with Protocol NP30179 v8 to reduce the incidence and severity of CRS.  
Following evaluation of the observed CRS frequency and severity and initial efficacy data, step-up 
dosing with 2.5/10/30 mg was considered to be safe and tolerable and was selected as the 
recommended Phase II dose. This dosing regimen was subsequently investigated in the dose 
expansion cohorts, in Part III of the study. 
For statistical and PK analyses purposes presented in this SCE, obinutuzumab pre-treatment (Gpt) 
administered 7 days prior to the initial dose of glofitamab (i.e. Cycle 1 Day -7) as described in the 
study protocol corresponds to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1 = baseline). Consequently, in the analyses, the 
first dose of glofitamab corresponds to C1D8 and for patients receiving the step-up dosing regimen, 
administration of the initial low dose of glofitamab (2.5 mg) 7 days after Gpt corresponds to C1D8 and 
administration of the intermediate 10 mg glofitamab dose 7 days after the first glofitamab dose 
corresponds to C1D15. Thus, the cycles and days of administration of Gpt and glofitamab presented 
henceforth in this SCE follows the conventions noted above.

• 
Patients with another invasive malignancy in the last 2 years (with the exception of basal cell 
carcinoma and tumors deemed by the investigator to be of low likelihood for recurrence) 
•  Received systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to Gpt infusion. 
Treatment with corticosteroid ≤25 mg/day prednisone or equivalent is allowed. Inhaled and 
topical steroids were permitted. 
This study was conducted at 41 center(s) that enrolled patients in: Spain (8 centers), France (7 
centers), USA (6 centers), Australia (3 centers), Belgium (3 centers), Italy (3 centers), Poland (3 
centers), Denmark (2 centers), Taiwan (2 centers), Canada (1 center), Czech Republic (1 center), 
Finland (1 center), and New Zealand (1 center). 
Two populations have been recruited, which are relevant for the current submission. First of all, a 
population with different NHLs has been recruited in Parts I and II, which were utilized for dose 
escalation: Grades 1-3b FL; MZL (splenic; nodal; extra-nodal); MCL; DLBCL; PMBCL; Richter’s 
transformation; and trFL.  
In the second stage, cohorts with DLBCL, PMBCL and HGBCL were opened to test the dosing for 
efficacy (Part III). The population utilized for this submission was defined as: DLBCL cohort (DLBCL 
NOS, HGBCL), PMBCL and trFL. Patients must have relapsed after or failed to respond to at least two 
prior systemic treatment regimens (including at least one prior regimen containing anthracycline, and 
at least one containing an anti CD20-directed therapy). 
Treatments 
An initial low dose of glofitamab was administered on C1D8 followed by an intermediate dose of 
glofitamab one week later on C1D15. The target dose of glofitamab was administered in the following 
cycle (C2D1) and subsequent three-week cycles. 
Obinutuzumab pre-treatment (i.e., Gazyva/Gazyvaro pre-treatment [Gpt]) was given as a safety 
measure to deplete B-cells both in the peripheral blood and in the secondary lymphoid organs, in an 
attempt toreduce the risk of sudden cytokine release associated with the first glofitamab 
administration. All cohorts received Gpt pre-treatment on C1D1, seven days prior to starting 
glofitamab administration on C1D8. Gpt is a fixed dose of Gazyva/Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab; 1000 mg 
IV).  
Tocilizumab was included to manage a potential safety risk in the treatment of patients with severe 
CRS and was also classified as an IMP. Corticosteroid premedication was given to help reduce the 
glofitamab-induced cytokine levels. 
Following evaluation of the observed CRS frequency and severity and initial efficacy data, step-up 
dosing with 2.5/10/30 mg was considered to be safe and tolerable and was selected as the 
recommended Phase II dose. This dosing regimen was subsequently investigated in the dose 
expansion cohorts, initially in Cohort D3, in Part III of the study.  
Treatment with glofitamab was for 12 cycles (3-week cycles).  
Retreatment with glofitamab (following a new pre-treatment with obinutuzumab) was offered to 
eligible patients based on their clinical responses after completion of the initial glofitamab treatment.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint – IRC assed CR rate is acceptable as per Lugano criteria (Cheson et al. 2014) 
and adequate for determining response in DLBCL and other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
Tumor and response evaluations were determined by the IRC and INV on the basis of radiological 
assessments and bone marrow examinations (if appropriate), using the Lugano classification (Cheson 
et al. 2014). 
Bone marrow examinations (if appropriate) were to include biopsy and/or aspirate for morphology and 
flow cytometry and were required at screening for staging purposes unless a bone marrow examination 
had been performed within 3 months prior to study 
If positive for tumor cells at screening, a subsequent bone marrow examination was required to 
confirm a CR. For patients with DLBCL, PET/CT scans could be utilized to assess bone marrow 
involvement; bone marrow examinations were not required unless clinically indicated 
The clinical response assessment was to include an evaluation of the presence and degree of enlarged 
lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly by physical examination. 
The IRC, composed of board-certified radiologists and an oncologist with experience in malignant 
lymphoma, assessed all patients for response and progression on the basis of imaging results, bone 
marrow biopsy sample results, and relevant clinical data, and were blinded to INV-assessed data and 
guided by a charter specific to the independent review. 
Radiographic Assessments 
PET CT is considered mandatory at the diagnosis of DLBCL. FDG PET/CT imaging was the preferred 
radiologic modality for assessing FDG-avid lymphomas and was recommended to assess baseline 
tumor burden in this study. Following the baseline PET/CT scan, PET/CT scans could be limited to areas 
of disease involvement if required by local Health Authorities.   
PROs 
PROs were measured with validated questionnaires like EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-Lym. 
Sample size 
This is a phase I/II study. The sample size changed during the course of the study. In protocol version 
1 (21 Jul 2016) the sample size for the expansion cohort for R/R DLBCL was 40 patients. The expected 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 67/158 
 
 
 
 
width for the confidence interval for the response rate was calculating assuming an observed response 
of 50% and 65%. In protocol version 6 (8 Aug 2018) the sample size for the R/R DBLCL patients was 
increased to 100. The expected confidence interval for CR was calculated based on a CR rate of 30% 
and 35%. 
The sample size considerations seem minimalistic, but acceptable and adequate for an exploratory 
Phase 2 trial. They do not align with standards for a confirmatory trial and does not provide the power 
to reject a specific CR and have quite different assumptions as planning scenarios.  
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The study is a single arm multi-cohort study. No randomisation was used. No measures to blind the 
study team were in place. An internal monitoring committee was used. 
Statistical methods 
The determination of sample size, planned analyses and statistical tests are described in detail in the 
NP30179 Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) v3, and superseded the statistical analyses specified in 
Protocol NP30179 v10. 
Efficacy analysis population 
The efficacy evaluable population includes all patients who had at least one response assessment at 
any time during the study (earliest time point for R/R DLBCL is 49 days since the first dose of 
glofitamab or 56 days from the first dose of obinutuzumab). The ITT population contains all enrolled 
patients. 
The definition of the ITT-population is endorsed (All patients enrolled in the study will be included in 
the ITT population used for efficacy analyses). The definition of the efficacy analysis population has 
changed over time (changes were made in protocol version 6, 7, and 8). In the protocol version 10 (24 
Dec 2020), the efficacy analysis population is defined as “Efficacy Analysis Population: The efficacy-
evaluable population will include all patients who have been assessed for response at any time on 
study, who have withdrawn from treatment or study prior to reaching their first response assessment, 
or who have been on-study long enough to have reached their first scheduled response assessment, 
defined as having a minimum of 37 days since the first dose of glofitamab, or 44 days since the first 
dose of obinutuzumab pre-treatment, at the time of data cut-off”. It is stated in the CSR that the 
analysis specified in the SAP superseded those described in the protocol v 10. The applicant presented 
the IRC-CR rate for the ITT, which includes all enrolled patients.   
Primary efficacy endpoint IRC-CR 
The applicant aimed to investigate the treatment effect, defined as the number of complete responses, 
in patients who at least had one scan assessment. Patients with missing assessments are considered 
non-responders. The applicant performed an indirect comparison of the proportion of observed 
complete responses against a historical responder rate of 20% using an exact binomial test. Clopper-
Pearson confidence intervals were presented. 
Participants with missing data included in the efficacy population are considered non-responders. The 
applicant presented the results for IRC-CR obtained with the ITT as supplementary analysis. The 
results are comparable to those obtained with the efficacy population.  
Estimand framework for the primary endpoint 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 68/158 
 
 
 
 
Variable: Number of patients who achieve a CR according to the IRC assessment of PET-CT scans with 
use of Lugano criteria. 
Population: The study population is defined in Protocol Section 4.2. The primary endpoint analysis will 
be conducted on the efficacy population. 
Treatment: Patients will first receive Gpt and then glofitamab for up to 12 cycles. Tocilizumab will be 
used to manage any severe CRS that may result. 
Intercurrent Event: Missing response assessment because of early study withdrawal or study 
discontinuation for any reason. 
Composite Strategy: Patients included in the efficacy-evaluable population with missing or no response 
assessments will be included as non-responders. 
Population Level Summary: The proportion of patients in the efficacy-evaluable population whose best 
overall response is a CR based on IRC assessment of PET-CT scans with use of Lugano criteria: 
Comparisons of CR between the efficacy-evaluable population and historical controls will be conducted 
by using an exact binomial test with a two-sided alpha level of 5%. 
Sensitivity analysis COVID-19 
If more than 5% of patients experienced a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, a sensitivity 
analysis was planned to be performed for the primary endpoint, IRC-assessed CR rate, by removing 
any patients who experienced a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 diagnosis. An analysis of the safety 
profile for patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 was planned to be performed, and key safety 
summaries for these patients produced separately. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints INV-CR, INV-ORR and IRC-ORR 
These were analysed using the same statistical methods as described for IRC-CR. 
Secondary time-to-event endpoints DOCR and DOR  
The applicant aimed to investigate the duration of response in patients who at least had one scan 
assessment and achieved a response/complete response. Patients who discontinue the study while 
responding or start a new anti-cancer therapy before declared PD are censored. Thus, the applicant 
assumed that the duration of response in those patients would have been similar to that observed in 
the responders who did not discontinue the study. Kaplan-Meier curves and timepoint estimates were 
presented for DOR and DOCR.  
Estimand Framework for Duration of Response Endpoints 
Variable: Duration of patients’ response 
Population: The study population is defined in Protocol Section 4.2. Duration of response will be 
calculated for patients who achieve an IRC- or investigator-assessed CR (and PR for DOR) by PET-CT 
according to Lugano criteria. 
Treatment: Patients will first receive Gpt and then glofitamab for up to 12 cycles. Tocilizumab will be 
used to manage any severe CRS that may result. 
Intercurrent Event: Patients who discontinue or withdraw from the study while responding; patients 
who discontinue treatment when starting a new anti-lymphoma therapy (NALT) 
Hypothetical Strategy: Patients who continue to respond will have their data censored at the date of 
the last response assessment by CT, or PET-CT.

Population Level Summary: Kaplan-Meier estimates will be provided at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. 
The median will be presented if reached. The Brookmeyer-Crowley method will be used to construct 
the 95% CI for the median DOR/DOCR.

If more than 5% of patients discontinued the study because they were starting a new anti-lymphoma 
treatment (NALT), an event-free survival analysis was planned to be done with progression, NALT, and 
death counted as events. 
The applicant also planned to perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of COVID-19 for DOR, 
DOCR, and PFS.  
Interim analyses 
According to the SAP, the applicant could perform a nonbinding interim analysis for safety and futility 
for each expansion cohort in Part III of the study. According to the applicant, no interim analysis for 
efficacy was performed for the D3 cohort. The results from an analysis performed in the D2 cohort 
were used to inform the decision to continue with the trial in the D3 cohort.  
Multiplicity control 
The trial has been conducted as an exploratory trial without the usual rigour as seen in a confirmatory 
trial, e.g. lack of control of type 1 error across hypotheses being tested statistically or insufficient 
predefinition of hypotheses.  Thus, all results should be seen as the basis for the generation of 
hypotheses on treatment effects, with less or strong belief on the chance of confirming these, based on 
the individual results only. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The primary efficacy population (N=108) comprises those patients with R/R DLBCL (71.3%), HGBCL 
(7.4%), PMBCL (5.6%), and transformed FL (15.7%) who have received ≥2 prior systemic therapies 
treated at the proposed registrational dose of glofitamab of 2.5/10/30 mg in Cohort D3. The clinical 
cut-off date for the latest update for both patient disposition, efficacy data and safety data is 15 June 
2022. In this update, 2 patients have had their diagnosis revised from DLBCL to HGBCL.

CHMP assessment report

There are 3 versions of the SAP. The current version of the SAP was dated 23 Nov 2021. According to 
the applicant, no changes in the planned analyses were made after the interim database snapshot (19 
November 2021).  The applicant clarified that the database lock was one day after the finalization of 
the relevant SAP version 3 and only the database snapshot was taken already on 19 November, i.e. 4 
days prior to finalization of the SAP. It is further stated that “Therefore, the applicant’s statistical team 
had no access to the study data and outputs until after SAP version 3 was approved.” It is also 
acknowledged that already in SAP version 2, dated 16 June 2020, it was clarified that the cohort of 
primary interest (of that SAP) was Cohort D3 and that hypothesis testing was to be conducted for the 
primary endpoint in that cohort only. 
The impact of the COVID-19 specific sensitivity analyses, censoring rules for time to response and 
duration of response and additional details related to the historical control are indeed not considered 
critical for the overall outcome of the trial (regardless of whether these decisions had been informed by 
the data or not). It is also agreed that the key analysis methods for cohort D3 were specified already in 
the initial SAP, i.e., a binomial test for r/r DLBCL patients against a CR rate of 20% was already 
defined with SAP version 1. However, the decision to consider cohort D3 as pivotal is – to the best of 
our knowledge – only documented within SAP version 3 and there only in the list of changes. Given the 
complexity of the study and its exploratory nature, this is still considered a flaw in the conduct of study 
which cannot be ruled out by the provided response.  
No GCP inspections have taken place for Study NP30179. 
Baseline data 
In the primary efficacy cohort D3 (N=108) 43.5% were still on study at the CCOD. 24/108 patients 
(22.2%) had completed initial treatment, 80 patients had discontinued initial study treatment and 3 
(2.8%) were still on treatment. 
All patients in the primary efficacy cohort D3 have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, which is in 
line with the indication sought. 
The study population includes a number of different diagnoses (DLBCL NOS, HGBCL, PMBCL) as well as 
the clinically distinct group of transformed FL.

Only 3 subjects have been pre-treated with PI3K Inhibitors and no statement as to efficacy in such 
subjects can be made in this study.  
38 subjects received CAR-Ts in the previous therapies, of which 34/38 were considered refractory.  
Numbers analysed 
This application is based on Cohort D3 from Study NP30179. The complexity of the trial and the very 
variable number of subjects enrolled to the various cohorts at the time of the data cutoff is illustrated 
in table 1, figure 1 and table 3 above. The justification for choosing cohort D3 as the primary efficacy 
cohort was initially not completely obvious (data-driven or arbitrarily chosen), however, upon 
clarification from the applicant justification is acceptable. All arms, where single or double Gpt dose is 
used are referred to as “monotherapy”.

Table 18 Analyses of Efficacy for Patients with R/R DLBCL Who Have Received ≥2 Prior Systemic 
Therapies 
For assessment purposes, the n=108 (ITT) will be used through assessment report and SmPC.  
Results from Supportive Efficacy populations include patients who have received glofitamab doses ≥10 
mg (cohorts B2, B3 and D2-Sub1 = 100 patients, with no overlap with cohort D3) and pooled results 
from cohorts treated with the proposed registrational step up dosing (cohorts D2-Sub2 + D3 = 115 
patients). 
All patients in the pivotal cohort and supportive efficacy populations had received at least two prior 
lines of therapy before enrolment. 
Primary Efficacy Population: 
• 
Patients with R/R DLBCL treated with ≥2 prior systemic therapies enrolled in primary efficacy 
Cohort D3 treated at the proposed registrational step-up dosing of 2.5/10/30 mg IV Q3W 
glofitamab (N=108). This population is comprised of patients who had received at least two prior 
systemic therapies, including patients with DLBCL not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS), DLBCL 
arising from follicular lymphoma (trFL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL), and primary 
mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and have received the proposed registrational dose of 
2.5/10/30 mg. 
Supportive Efficacy Population: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 79/158 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Glofitamab doses ≥10 mg: Patients with R/R DLBCL enrolled to receive doses of 10 mg-25 mg 
glofitamab (Cohorts B2, B3 [Study Part II and Part III: 10 mg, 16 mg, 25 mg or 10/16 mg fixed 
dosing] and Cohort D2 [Sub. 1] [Study Part II, 2.5/10/16 mg step-up dosing]) (N=100). 
•  Glofitamab 2.5/10/30 mg: Patients with R/R DLBCL treated with ≥2 prior systemic therapies in 
Cohort D2 [Sub. 2] + Cohort D3 + D5 treated at the proposed registrational dose of 2.5/10/30 mg 
IV Q3W glofitamab (N=155). 
•  Supportively, 115 patients with R/R DLBCL treated with step-up-doses of 2.5/10/30 mg glofitamab 
in the supportive efficacy cohorts D2 [Sub. 2] + D3. 
 For efficacy analysis 108 patients from D3 were included in the ITT population and includes a patient 
that received no study drug (enrolled by error).

Primary efficacy endpoint: CR by IRC (CCOD 15 JUNE 2022):  
There was a 35.2% IRC-assessed CR-rate (CI 26.2-45.0) in the primary efficacy cohort D3, unchanged 
with the update with longer follow-up. The median duration of CR was not reached ([95% CI: 18.4, 
NE]).  
Different CR-rates were noted in the application. The applicant has explained that the discrepancy in 
CR-rates is due to one being based on the ITT population (CR-rate=35.2%) while the other is based on 
the efficacy evaluable population (CR-rate=36.1%). For the purposes of this assessment, data from 
the ITT population will be utilized.  
Secondary endpoints (CCOD 15 JUNE 2022): 
DOCR:

Based on updated data, in the primary efficacy Cohort D3, the median duration of follow-up for IRC-
assessed DOCR was 12.8 months (95% CI: 11.6, 18.2) (see Table above), while median follow-up for 
INV-assessed DOCR was 15.9 months. The median IRC-assessed DOCR was not reached ([95% CI: 
18.4, NE]). The K-M estimated event-free rates among complete responders at 3, 6, 9, 12 months 
were 94.4%, 88.1%, 78.1%, and 74.6%, respectively.

DOR:  
Of the 54 patients with R/R DLBCL treated with glofitamab step-up doses of 2.5/10/30 mg in primary 
efficacy Cohort D3 who achieved a response (CR or PR) as determined by the IRC, 30 patients (55.6%) 
remained in remission and 24 patients (44.4%) subsequently had disease progression or died at the 
updated cut-off date of 15 June 2022.

38/uCSR above). 
Time to First CR (TFCR) and Time to First OR (TFOR): 
The median TFCR and TFOR were 42 days.

Among the 54 patients with R/R DLBCL treated with glofitamab step-up doses of 2.5/10/30 mg in 
primary efficacy Cohort D3 who achieved an overall response (CR or PR) by IRC-assessment in Cohort 
D3, the median time to first overall response was 42.0 days (range: 31 - 178 days).   
PFS and OS: 
Median PFS was 3.7 (95% CI: 3.3, 6.8) months in patients in Cohort D3. The median duration of 
follow-up for IRC Assessed PFS was 9.0 months (95% CI: 8.5, 9.6) for patients in Cohort D3.  
At the CCOD 15 JUNE 2022, 63 of the 108 patients (58.3%) with R/R DLBCL in the primary efficacy 
Cohort D3 had died, with a median survival of 8.9 (95% CI: 7.1, 15.3) months.  
Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) 
Patients reported moderate to moderate-high levels at baseline of Physical Functioning, Role 
Functioning, and global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) and low levels of Fatigue (weakness, 
tiredness) at baseline; which were maintained during treatment. Most patients indicated that 
symptoms commonly associated with treatment (nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting) were 
not present or were of low severity if present, and maintained during treatment. Patients reported low 
levels of lymphoma symptoms at baseline as measured by the FACT-Lym Lymphoma scale which were 
maintained during treatment. 
Improvement for EORTC QLQ C-30 physical function, role function and GHS/QOL and FACT-Lym LymS 
is defined as an increase in the subscale score. Improvement for EORTC QLQ-30 fatigue is defined as a 
decrease in the subscale score. 
Although PRO results are inconsistent and based on small numbers of patients filling out the 
questionnaires properly and considering the fact that patients died during the study, very slight 
beneficial effect may be seen in patients that filled the questionnaires and continued treatment.

The majority of patients characterized as double-hit without a HGBCL diagnosis were trFL with the 
relevant translocations. The group of 17 patients labelled trFL encompasses 8 DLBCL, 5 HGBCL and 4 
“trFL” histologies. The latter indicate patients whose transformation occurred at an earlier line of 
treatment. Of the whole trFL group, 7/17 (41%) patients achieved a CR. CRs could be further 
subdivided based on histology: 4/8 DLBCL (50%), 2/5 HGBCL (40%) and 1/4 (25%) “trFL” achieved a 
CR. In total, Study NP30179 includes 79 DLBCL patients + 6 HGBCL patients + 6 PMBCL patients + 17 
trFL patients = 108 patients; in the latest update, two DLBCL patients have been reclassified as 
HGBCL, the total number of patients remains at 108.

Of 418 patients in study NP30179, only two (0.5%) patients were negative for anti-glofitamab 
antibodies at baseline and became positive following treatment. Due to the limited number of patients 
with antibodies against glofitamab, no conclusions can be drawn concerning a potential effect of 
immunogenicity on efficacy or safety.

Primary Analysis 
Analysis population 
and time point 
description 
The primary efficacy population comprised 108 R/R DLBCL patients in Cohort D3 
who had received ≥2 prior lines of systemic therapy treated with glofitamab step-up 
dosing at the intended registrational dose (2.5/10/30 mg) and schedule (Q3W). 
Efficacy was evaluated by scheduled tumor assessments at Cycles 3, 6, 9 and end 
of treatment, and every 6 months until progression. 
The primary analysis in the glofitamab monotherapy R/R DLBCL Cohort D3 was to 
occur when the following condition was met: 
• 
The efficacy-evaluable population (Cohort D3) has approximately a median of 10 
months of follow-up since the first response recorded, unless the patient has 
withdrawn before this time point.

Notes 
Patients enrolled in the study with R/R FL treated with glofitamab monotherapy and 
patients with R/R NHL (all histologies) treated with glofitamab in combination with 
obinutuzumab will be reported separately at a later time. 
Concordance between the IRC- and INV-assessment on whether a patient achieved a 
CR was high (94.5%). 
The CR rate and ORR for relevant subpopulations in Cohort D3 defined by 
demographic, baseline disease, prior treatment, prognostic factors, and prior CAR-T 
therapy were similar to the response rate for Cohort D3 overall.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Application is based on preliminary results from the phase I/II study NP30179. A confirmatory 
randomised phase 3 study has commenced as part of the conditions for granting CMA (A Phase III 
Study Evaluating Glofitamab in Combination with Gemcitabine + Oxaliplatin vs Rituximab in 
Combination With Gemcitabine + Oxaliplatin in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-
Cell Lymphoma, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04408638). 
NP30179 is an ongoing single-arm, first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, Phase I/II dose-escalation 
and cohort-expansion study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 
glofitamab. The study investigates glofitamab in various dose regimens (fixed dose, step-up dose 
regimen, extended step-up dose regimen; Q2W/Q3W) as a single agent with one or two 1000 mg 
doses of obinutuzumab/Gazyvaro given as pre-treatment (Gpt), and/or as combination therapy of 
glofitamab and obinutuzumab in patients with R/R NHL. All patients received Gpt so there is no way to 
differentiate the effect of Gpt from glofitamab, and it is not feasible to determine the CRS-mitigating 
effect of Gpt.  
Different cohorts for R/R DLBCL and R/R FL are included. The study currently consists of 17 cohorts, 9 
of which are dose expansion cohorts in study part III. The primary efficacy cohort for this application 
was defined as D3 and includes 108 patients with various aggressive histologies, treated with step-up 
dosing of glofitamab (to reduce risk of cytokine release syndrome). The study was initiated as a Phase 
1 study and was subsequently amended 10 times. Only with Protocol Amendment 9 (= Protocol 
Version 10) was the study title upgraded to call the study a Phase 1/2 study. 
The confirmatory cohort was only defined in the SAP, which was finalized on 23. Nov 2021. The clinical 
data cut-off date was before that on 14 Sept 2021, i.e., the decision on the primary analysis cohort 
was made after all data had been accrued, and thus open to bias due to choices related to 
specifications on the analyses. The choice of a single cohort out of many is problematic as there is no 
multiplicity control over cohorts, despite the highly flexible and data-driven nature of the study. This 
was also considered critical given the lack of a clear dose rationale and given that the applicant 
continues to investigate combination therapies (with obinutuzumab) in the same indication and within 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 95/158 
 
 
 
 
the same study. Moreover, the study was open-label and guided by an internal review committee with 
the risk of upward biased results.  
Overall, it is noted that the response data seems comparable within comparable populations (i.e., 
within r/r NHL or within r/r DLBCL but not across these populations). However, no data for the 
combination therapy arms in the DLBCL cohorts was provided and hence this information and a 
potential type 1 error in relation to this data cannot be ascertained. Since the other cohorts do not 
concern this application, this issue will not be further pursued. It is also noted that no documentation 
of the decision to consider the study a confirmatory study and Cohort D3 as confirmatory cohort was 
provided. The type 1 error concern and related possibilities of selection bias were thus substantially 
alleviated.  
It is obvious that the study was designed as an exploratory early-phase study. For this purpose, the 
study design itself (open-label single-arm trial without independent DMC), the flexibility in the study 
design, the lack of type-1-error control (or the lack of a pre-specified pivotal cohort), and the many 
substantial amendments are considered acceptable. All these issues are, however, considered very 
critical for a confirmatory trial considered to provide pivotal evidence of efficacy and safety. 
The histological cancer subtypes enrolled included DLBCL (73.1% patients), trFL (15.7% patients), and 
HGBCL and PMBCL (5.6% patients each). The median number of prior cancer therapies was 3 (range: 
2-7). 34.3% patients had failed prior CAR-T therapy. The majority of the patients were refractory to 
any prior therapy (90.7% patients). As such, the patients enrolled in the study have a poor prognosis 
and are reflective of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and of the indication sought. Patients with 
autoimmune disease, prior allogeneic transplant, follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3B and those with HIV 
and hepatitis were excluded. PET CT is considered mandatory at the diagnosis of DLBCL. FDG PET/CT 
imaging was the preferred radiologic modality for assessing FDG-avid lymphomas and was 
recommended to assess baseline tumor burden in this study.   
With a fixed treatment duration of 12 cycles (approximately 8.3 months) and the majority of CRs 
achieved early on during the treatment (median 42 days), up to approximately 7 months CR follow-up 
occurs while a patient receives glofitamab treatment. Therefore, the current median DOCR follow up of 
12.8 months in Cohort D3 and a 12-month event free rate of 74.6% suggest that glofitamab responses 
are maintained beyond the end of treatment. The longest CR follow-up in Cohort D3 was 20 months, 
which is at least 12 months while being off treatment. Additionally, patient convenience and safety are 
important considerations for limiting treatment to 12 cycles in the target population, given the durable 
responses observed. CR rate and duration of CR /duration of response are acceptable and meaningful 
endpoints in the setting of R/R DLBCL. 
Due to the design of the trial, the question as to whether efficacy was a primary or secondary endpoint 
could impact the power of the trial. In addition, the size of the primary efficacy cohort was increased –
from ~40 to ~100 patients– while the study was ongoing, which was discussed and found acceptable. 
The primary endpoint for the main efficacy cohort was CR-rate as assessed by independent review 
committee (IRC). CR-rate as assessed by investigator (INV) and duration of complete response 
(DOCR) assessed by IRC and INV were the key secondary endpoints. The primary and secondary 
endpoints are considered relevant and appropriate for a single-arm trial in R/R DLBCL. Concordance 
between the IRC- and INV-assessment on whether a patient achieved a CR was high (94.4%). The 
applicant also compared the CR-rate of glofitamab to the CR-rate of a historical cohort of R/R DLBCL 
compiled from a number of published trials in R/R DLBCL dating back to 2008, but this indirect 
comparison was not deemed very useful for B/R assessment.  
Considering the limitations of an open-label nature of the trial, PROs measured with validated 
questionnaires like EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-Lym are considered only supportive in assessment of 
efficacy. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 96/158 
 
 
 
Supportive efficacy data are provided from patients in the dose-expansion part of the study who 
received the proposed registrational dose of glofitamab and a cohort of patients treated with the 
proposed registrational dose including mandatory pre-treatment with dexamethasone (whereas the 
primary efficacy cohort was pre-treated with physician’s choice of corticosteroid). Since both 
obinutuzumab and corticosteroids have anti-lymphoma activity, these differences are considered to be 
non-negligible and preclude pooling of results with the primary efficacy cohort. 
Overall, data on duration of CR presented in the supportive efficacy populations are consistent with 
data in the primary efficacy population. Because of the longer follow up time (26.0 months; Table 
29/uCSR), DOCR data from patients treated with doses of glofitamab ≥10mg provide further indication 
of the durability of CR responses. 
Searching the Clinicaltrials.gov database, 13 additional studies for glofitamab (excluding the pivotal 
NP30179 and GO41944 which is intended to be used as SOB) have been identified. None of these 
additional studies has been considered supportive by the applicant. Obinutuzumab pretreatment, 
corticosteroid premedication as well as step-up dosing as submitted within the MAA have a rationale in 
the pivotal NP30179 study. Moreover, the doses and premedication investigated by the applicant and 
in investigator-initiated studies seem to oscillate around what is currently sought to be approved and 
will possibly not be changed very much in the future due to similar efficacy and similar incidence of 
related AEs across studies. The applicant provided additional data from study YO42610 which seem to 
confirm efficacy and safety results of the pivotal NP30179 study. 
Study NP30179 includes 79 DLBCL patients + 6 HGBCL patients + 6 PMBCL patients + 17 trFL patients 
= 108 patients -note that in the latest update, two DLBCL patients have been reclassified as HGBCL, so 
that the ITT denominator is 108 including all patients with correct histologies (IE, including the trFL 
patient who did not receive treatment but excluding the FL gr 1-3A patient who was treated). The 
patient with FL gr 1-3A who was enrolled in error and treated had a CR. As such, it does not make 
sense to include a single patient with an indolent lymphoma in a trial of aggressive histologies and 
given the above, it is accepted that the applicant’s proposition of an ITT population of n=108 is the 
most pragmatic.  
The majority of patients characterized as double-hit without a HGBCL diagnosis were trFL with the 
relevant translocations. This explains the discrepancy between the HGBCL and double-/triple-hit 
populations. Since the wording used was slightly ambiguous, the applicant was requested to verify that 
all patients counted as double-hit have a MYC translocation. The applicant was only able to 
substantiate that 5 of the original 13 claimed double-/triple-hit patients did in fact have this diagnosis. 
The diagnosis was conclusively disproven in 4 patients (3 had their diagnoses revised while 1 was 
found to be MYC-translocation negative). For 3 patients, no biopsy was available for ascertainment of 
MYC-translocation and these have been reported as major protocol deviations. The designation of 
double-/triple-hit diagnosis is not possible in the absence of a MYC-translocation and so the applicant 
should not claim double/triple-hit status in any lymphomas where such a translocation is not 
demonstrated. Given that this will not have an impact on whether glofitamab can be approved, it is not 
pursued further.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At the updated data cut-off (15 JUNE 2022), with a median follow-up for DOCR of 12.8 months, the 
primary efficacy endpoint in the main efficacy dataset (D3, n=108), CR-rate by IRC, was 35.2% (95% 
CI 26.2, 45.0) with a median DOCR not yet reached. Overall, these results are clinically meaningful in 
the R/R DLBCL setting. The comparison to a historical control cohort with a CR rate of 20% is not 
deemed useful for B/R assessment in this context. It is agreed, though, that the totality of evidence 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 97/158 
 
 
 
suggests that the studied treatment (and the studied dosing regimen) is efficacious in the targeted 
population. It is particularly noteworthy that the duration of CR extends beyond the duration of fixed 
glofitamab treatment. 
Overall, baseline characteristics of the disease itself seems well distributed as to Ann Arbor, IPI, 
extranodal disease and bulky disease. The age distribution of subjects enrolled in this trial is 
considered reasonably representative of the R/R DLBCL population (3rd line and higher). Responses 
were noted in all age brackets and for age cohorts with more than 2 patients enrolled, matched the 
response rate of the entire cohort well.  
The median time to CR was 42 days, meaning that responses were evident after patients had received 
the step-up dosing and one full maintenance dose of glofitamab. This is of clinical relevance as quick 
responses are of benefit in aggressive diseases such as R/R DLBCL and also as it means that patients 
who do not respond will be able to discontinue treatment relatively quickly. 
The efficacy cohort included a number of different histologies. In the updated data package, two 
patients have had their diagnosis changed from DLBCL to HGBCL. Updated subtype analysis on the 
different lymphoma types now demonstrate the following CR-rates: DLBCL = 36% (CI 26-48%), 
HGBCL = 0%, PMBCL = 50% (CI 12-88%) and trFL 41% (18-67%). While these results are, with the 
exception of DLBCL, based on very small numbers of patients (DLBCL=77 pts, HGBCL=8 pts, PMBCL=6 
pts and trFL=17 pts), it is notable that not a single patient with HGBCL had a CR.  
The treatment effect was in general consistent across relevant subpopulations defined by e.g., 
demographic (gender, age range categories, race/ethnicity, ECOG PS), prior CAR-T therapy, NHL 
subtype at study entry, relapse and refractory status and risk factors for IPI. Encouragingly, patients 
previously having failed CAR-T treatment, patients receiving glofitamab post autologous stem cell 
transplant therapy and those who were refractory to their last line of treatment (all of which represent 
difficult-to-treat patient categories) achieved 32%, 56% and 29% CR-rates, respectively.  
The applicant has clarified that the group of 17 patients labelled trFL encompasses 8 DLBCL, 5 HGBCL 
and 4 “trFL” histologies. The latter indicate patients whose transformation occurred at an earlier line of 
treatment. Of the whole trFL group, 7/17 (41%) patients achieved a CR. CRs could be further 
subdivided based on histology: 4/8 DLBCL (50%), 2/5 HGBCL (40%) and 1/4 (25%) “trFL” achieved a 
CR.  
Regarding the MoA of glofitamab (targeting CD20 on malignant B-cells and recruiting host T-cells): 
CD20 expression on tumour cells was assumed but not tested for prior to enrolment. This is considered 
problematic in a patient population where all participants have failed prior anti-CD20 targeting therapy 
as part of the eligibility criteria. The applicant has ascertained CD20 status for participants and 
correlated this with glofitamab response. Overall, concern remains that previous anti-CD20 treatment 
could negatively impact the efficacy of glofitamab in the intended patient population. Sequencing of 
drugs with the same target in subsequent treatment lines is controversial and, for example, recent 
CD19-targeting CAR-T lymphoma trials had either exclusion criteria to limit prior CD19 targeted 
therapy and/or required verification of continued CD19 expression for eligibility. All patients in the 
intended population for glofitamab treatment (3L+ R/R DLBCL) will have been exposed to prior anti-
CD20 treatment. This is well reflected in the study population where 100% of patients were previously 
exposed to anti-CD20 therapy. No effort to ascertain CD20 status prior to enrollment was reported, 
despite this being a routine test in lymphoma (relapse) diagnosis. 85% of enrolled patients were 
refractory to any prior anti-CD20 therapy. This has important implications. It is perhaps not surprising 
that early relapses/refractory disease have an inferior prognosis, however, an alternative explanation 
could be that recent anti-CD20 treatment negatively impacts glofitamab activity. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 98/158 
 
 
 
The applicant has provided evidence that some patients enrolled in the study were in fact CD20-
negative. All 3 patients with CD20-negative disease (less than 5% of CD20-positive cells in the tumor 
area) had progressive disease as their best response to glofitamab and died during follow-up. One of 
the 3 patients had CD20-negativity demonstrated on an archival biopsy meaning that the result likely 
was available before enrolment and that the applicant and investigator in charge of enrolment 
therefore potentially knowingly included this patient in a trial of a CD20-targeting therapy (this might 
also be true of the other 2 CD20-negative patients). The applicant acknowledges that prior exposure to 
CD20-targeting agents may predispose to the development of CD20-related mechanisms of resistance. 
Subgroup analyses requested could also be interpreted to indicate some deleterious effect of (recent) 
prior anti-CD20 treatment. Overall, concern still remains that the clinical context in which glofitamab is 
given (in patients, all of whom have been exposed to prior CD20-targeted therapy) predisposes to 
development of resistance to CD20-targeted agents. Such resistance may be due to several 
mechanisms but the one that is possible thus far is low (less than 5%) CD20-expression. The relevant 
inclusion criterion defining the CD20-expression for the pivotal study was “a histologically-confirmed 
hematological malignancy that was expected to express CD20”. Such a wording suggests the 
expectation that glofitamab is only efficacious against CD20-positive lymphomas. This in turn 
translates to an uncertainty as to whether glofitamab provides any benefit in CD20-negative cases. 
Based on the responses provided by the applicant, it does not seem that glofitamab retains anti-
lymphoma activity in CD20-negative lymphomas. This casts doubt on whether benefit of glofitamab 
has been established for the entire patient population encompassed by the applicant’s proposed 
indication text. This uncertainty, is reflected as a warning at 4.4 in the SmPC: There are limited data 
available on patients with CD20-negative DLBCL treated with Columvi, and it is possible that patients 
with CD20-negative DLBCL may have less benefit compared to patients with CD20-positive DLBCL. The 
potential risks and benefits associated with treatment of patients with CD20-negative DLBCL with 
Columvi should be considered. The efficacy of Columvi has not been established in patients with CD20-
negative disease who have relapsed from prior anti-CD20 therapy. 
The approved therapeutic indication is Columvi as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), after two or more lines of 
systemic therapy.

Glofitamab is currently being investigated as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies in 
multiple Phase I/II studies and one Phase III open label, randomized (2:1) study in patients with R/R 
DLBCL. The confirmatory study agreed as an SOB for the CMA was discussed during a scientific advice 
procedure in Dec 2019 (EMEA/H/SA/4023/2/2019/III))is: A Phase III Study Evaluating Glofitamab in

Identifier: NCT04408638/ Study GO41944. The study is ongoing and the applicant intends to submit 
the Type II variation to fulfil this SOB approximately Q3 2024. Of 270 patients to be included, the 
number of patients enrolled as of 08 November 2022 has been provided. It should be noted that 
patients are eligible for this study as second-line treatment (as opposed to the current application 
which is third-line or higher). In addition, the only LBCL subtype that is eligible is DLBCL NOS 
(meaning that no further data on the efficacy of glofitamab in trFL, HGBCL and PMBCL will be provided 
by this study).  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In terms of complete response rate and duration of complete response, the efficacy of glofitamab in 
R/R DLBCL is considered promising. The need to further improve treatment outcomes and overcome 
resistance to other therapies with a manageable safety reflects the unmet need.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
•  Submission of the updated clinical study report with a minimum of 2 years follow-up from the 
end of treatment of the last patient enrolled in the primary safety population of Study NP30179 
in scope of procedure EMEA/H/C/005751/0000  
• 
In order to provide further evidence of efficacy and safety of glofitamab in DLBCL, the MAH will 
provide the results of Study GO41944, a phase III open-label, multicentre, randomised study 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of glofitamab in combination with gemcitabine plus 
oxaliplatin versus rituximab in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with 
relapsed or refractory DLBCL. The study is ongoing.  
In addition, following the recommendations of the CHMP,  
• 
• 
the applicant will provide the final list of CD20 expression in Study NP30179 for the entire 
Cohort D3 with evaluable CD20 and to correlate expression with response to glofitamab at the 
time of the 2 years follow-up from the end of treatment of the last patient enrolled in the 
primary safety population.  
The applicant will measure CD20 expression and correlate this to response and risk of CRS in 
the ongoing SOB phase III trial NCT04408638/ Study GO41944 (R-GemOx vs Glofit-GemOx in 
2L+ DLBCL NOS). 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
Primary safety population: Data from safety-evaluable patients (i.e. patients who have received at 
least one dose of study medication [obinutuzumab pre-treatment, glofitamab]) treated with 2.5/10/30 
mg step-up doses of glofitamab in the proposed indication (patients with R/R DLBCL who have received 
≥2 prior lines of systemic therapy) pooled from cohorts D2 subcohort 2 ([Sub.2], Part II), D3 (Part III) 
and Cohort D5 (Part III) (N=154 patients). The safety population has later been amended to exclude 
patients who did not receive glofitamab but only obinutuzumab (N=9).

2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
For the primary safety population (N = 154) at the 15 June 2022 CCOD, the median number of cycles 
of glofitamab received was 5.0 (range: 1-13 cycles), with 61.4% of patients receiving less than 8 
cycles and 29.7% of patients receiving 12 cycles of treatment, and median treatment duration was 
79.0 days (range: 1-326 days). Patients achieving a complete response (n=62 in the corresponding 
efficacy population) received a median of 12 cycles of glofitamab treatment whereas non-responders 
received fewer cycles largely due to study treatment discontinuation (Update SCS, Section 1.2.1). 
Exposure to treatment in Cohorts D3 and D5 was as follows: 
•  Cohort D3: median of 5.0 cycles of glofitamab (range: 1-13 cycles) and median 78.0 days 
treatment duration (range: 1-326 days). 
•  Cohort D5: median of 6.0 cycles of glofitamab (range: 1-12 cycles) and median 98.0 days 
treatment duration (range: 1-245 days).

−  Grade ≥ 2 neurologic adverse events 
−  Any suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) 
−  Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) (minimum Grade 3 by definition) 
− 
Febrile neutropenia (minimum Grade 3 by definition) 
−  Grade ≥ 2 aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin 
elevation 
−  Any grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (minimum Grade 2 by definition) 
−  Grade ≥ 2 tumor inflammation/flare (e.g., manifestation of signs/symptoms associated with an 
increase in size of known nodal or extranodal lesions by clinical or radiographic assessment) 
−  Any grade pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease (ILD) (excluding pneumonia of infectious 
etiology)*  
−  Colitis of any grade (excluding infectious etiology)* 
Cytokine Release Syndrome 
For the primary safety population (n=154) CRS AEs of any grade were reported in 99 patients (64.3%) 
by ASTCT 2019. The corresponding number for the extended safety population 2 (n=236; see table in 
the introduction to Safety) was 156 (66.1%). An OC has been raised regarding the inclusion of patients 
having only received Gpt (obinutuzumab) and not glofitamab. In particular CRS is not expected to 
occur in these patients and thus lowering the CRS frequency (when glofitamab untreated patients are 
included).   
In the primary safety population (n=154) a total of 47/154 patients (30.5%; based on ASTCT 2019) 
experienced multiple CRS AEs (Table 17/uSCS), and the corresponding number for the extended safety 
population 2 was 72/236 (30.5%). 
CRS SAEs: 
In the primary safety population (n=154) serious CRS AEs were experienced by 22.1% (Table 
17/uSCS) and for the extended safety population 1 (n=195), it was 28.7% (Table 20/uSCS).  
Hospitalisation or prolonged hospitalisation was the main reason for the SAEs events. No Grade 5 CRS 
AEs were reported, although there was one case of delirium leading to death in the setting of Grade 1 
CRS, but it is considered that this most likely was related to pain (potentially due to PD) and pain 
medication based on the narrative as signs of overdose was already apparent before treatment with 
glofitamab.

Grade ≥ 2 CRS AEs for glofitamab were reported as an AESI per the study protocol. In the primary 
safety population, 25/154 patients (16.2%) experienced a total of 27 Grade ≥ 2 CRS AEs by ASTCT 
2019 grading, and for the extended safety population 1  41/195 experienced a total of 51 Grade ≥ 2 
CRS AEs by ASTCT 2019 grading.  
In all patients with CRS AEs, the CRS was assessed as related to glofitamab treatment by the 
investigator and all patients received treatment for CRS. 
Table 45 
In the primary safety population 16/154 patients (10.4%) experienced CRS SAEs ≥ 2 by ASTCT 2019 
and in the extended safety population 1 this was observed in 29/195 (14.9%; Table 21 /uSCS).  
At the time of CCOD (15Jun2022) the CRS in 24/25 patients in the primary safety population with 
Grade ≥ 2 CRS had resolved.

Severity, onset, and duration of CRS: 
In the primary safety population, the severity of CRS was reduced by each glofitamab dose and only 
Grade 1 CRS was seen from Cycle 3 onwards (see Figure 9/uSCS).  
The time to onset and duration in cycle 1 and 2 varies considerably between patients. A patient card 
stating that the patients should contact their doctor if specified signs and symptoms for CRS occur, has 
been drafted, which is satisfactory. In the SmPC the median time to onset and duration including range 
has been included.

Management: 
In the primary safety population (N=154) ICU admission was required for 7/99 patients (7.1%) and 
31.3% required tocilizumab, 28 patients (28.3%) used corticosteroids, and 16 patients (16.2%) used 
both tocilizumab and corticosteroids to treat CRS (Table 25/uSCS). 
Table 47 
In the subgroup of patients with R/R NHL treated with 2.5/10/30 mg glofitamab (Cohort D3, Cohort D2 
[Sub. 2] and Cohort D5) (N=195) the use of the various treatments was generally comparable (Table 
26/uSCS  
The median number of tocilizumab infusions in the primary safety population was 1.0 (range 1 – 4) 
with a median total cumulative dose of 678.0 mg (range 450.0 – 1920.0), and a median dose intensity 
of 100.0% (range 100.0-100.0) underscoring the importance of the availability of this product when 
administering glofitamab.  
Information regarding hospitalisation and the length of hospitalisation is presented in the SmPC, 
section 4.8, for the primary safety population.

CRS with NAEs: 
PTs consistent with immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS; Lee et al. 2019) 
were also identified through the list of PTs presented in Appendix 2 of the SCS. NAEs consistent with 
ICANS event rates (non-concurrent and concurrent with CRS) were generally low and the majority 
were Grade 1-2 and considered unrelated to glofitamab study treatment. NAEs consistent with ICANS 
events concurrent to CRS also occurred infrequently (2.6%) mainly in the first cycle of glofitamab 
treatment. Considering the low frequency of NAEs consistent with ICANS events, it is agreed, that the 
NAEs section represents a more appropriate characterization of the neurological adverse events. 
Liver function test (LFT) AEs are discussed in the clinical chemistry section and below.   
Dexamethasone pre-treatment (Cohort D5) 
The applicant states that: “The differences in baseline characteristics between patients enrolled in 
Cohort D5 and those enrolled in Cohort D3 as well as the ongoing enrolment may, in part along with 
dexamethasone premedication, explain the lower incidence of all-grade CRS, serious CRS and Grade ≥ 
2 CRS in Cohort D5 compared with Cohort D3.” Based on the small number of patients, the difference 
in baseline characteristics, and the updated data, where the difference between D5 and D3 is less, the 
role of dexamethasone cannot be assessed.  
Cytokine release syndrome is included in the RMP Summary of safety concerns as an Important 
identified risk.  
Grade ≥ 2 Tumour Flare 
Tumour flare of any grade was reported in 17/154 patients (11.0%) and for ≥ Grade 2 in 11/154 
patients (7.1%) in the primary safety population. Tumour flare occurred most frequently in Cycle 1 
(16/17 patients) and 1/17 in Cycle 2 with a median time to onset of 2.00 days (range: 1.0-16.0 days). 
The median duration of Grade ≥ 2 tumour flare was 5.50 days (range: 1.0 – 27.0).

Nine of 11 patients (in the primary safety population, N=154) received treatment for tumour flare, 
which consisted of steroids and/or pain medication. This information including a warning to observe the 
patients for tumour flare is presented in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Table 49 
Tumour flare is included in the RMP Summary of safety concerns as an Important identified risk.  
≥ Grade 2 Neurologic Adverse Events 
In the primary safety population, 22 of 154 patients (14.3%) treated with glofitamab step-up dosing 
experienced a Grade ≥ 2 neurological AE. Of these 22 patients, 18 patients reported a Grade 2 event, 
2 patients reported a Grade 3 event, one patient reported Grade 4 myelitis (onset of 76.2 hours 
following the C1D15 10 mg glofitamab dose – see the SAE section), and one patient experienced the 
Grade 5 (fatal) event of delirium (onset of 56.8 hours following the C1D15 10 mg glofitamab dose – 
discussed in the SAE/deaths section and not assessed as related to glofitamab but to pain/pain-
treatment and PD). 
In the extended safety population 1 (N =195) the frequency of ≥ Grade 2 NAEs were 16.4%. With 
longer follow-up the incidences in both safety population had increased slightly.

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis 
At the time of the CCOD, no events of suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis were reported 
during Study NP30179. 
Grade ≥ 3 Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS) 
In the primary safety population, 2 of 154 patients (1.3%) experienced a Grade 3 TLS AE. The time to 
onset from the first glofitamab dose was 2.00 days for each patient, and the median duration was 4.00 
days (range: 3.0-5.0). At the time of the CCOD, both events had resolved.  
In patients who received glofitamab step-up dosing 2.5/10/30 mg (N=236/extended safety population 
2), one additional patient experienced a Grade 4 event. The applicant states: On Study Day 14, the 
patient died due to progressive disease or disease relapse (metabolic disease progression). An autopsy 
was not performed. The event of tumor lysis syndrome remained unresolved at the time of patient’s 
death. From the narrative there is no way of knowing if death was due to TLS or progressive disease in 
this MCL patient, highlighting the importance of the warning for TLS, which is presented in section 4.4 
and 4.8 of the SmPC.    
Grade ≥ 3 Febrile Neutropenia 
In the primary safety population, 4 of 154 patients (2.6%) treated with glofitamab step-up dosing 
experienced Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia. All events resolved.  
Information regarding the frequency of infections (SAEs and Grade 3-4 AEs) are presented in the 
relevant sections.

Grade ≥ 2 AST, ALT, or Total Bilirubin Elevation 
In the primary safety population, 11 of 154 patients (7.1%) experienced Grade ≥ 2 ALT, AST, or total 
bilirubin elevation (Grade 2: 5 patients and Grade 3: 6 patients). 7 patients (4.5%) had at least one 
unresolved or ongoing AE at the CCOD of 15 June 2022. There is no clear indication that glofitamab 
was the cause of the unresolved hepatic enzyme or bilirubin increases; the reason these cases had not 
resolved was most likely PD.

At the time of the CCOD, no events of disseminated intravascular coagulation were reported in Study

Pneumonitis and Interstitial Lung Disease (Any Grade) 
The investigators considered the two cases of ≥ Grade 2 pneumonitis in the population receiving the 
RP2D unrelated to glofitamab (and obinutuzumab), and reading the narratives it is difficult to assign 
causality, although both events occurred within one week of a CRS event; both resolved.

Colitis (Any Grade) 
One patient in Part II dose escalation Cohort D2 experienced severe colitis, which was considered 
related to glofitamab and concurrent DLBCL located abdominally. There were two episodes; the last 
starting on D111 and leading to a left end-ileostomy being performed on D234 with the last glofitamab 
dose on D175; C9D1. Treatment with infliximab was also administered. The patient died of PD D462 
after palliative radiotherapy D394-420. There were no additional patients with colitis in the Overall 
safety population (n=469).

Deaths 
The most frequent cause of death in the primary safety population (n=154) irrespective of time point 
(i.e., >/< 30 days after last dose) was progressive disease, which accounted for 61 deaths (75.3%), 
followed by 9 AEs [COVID-19 pneumonia (3 deaths), sepsis (2 deaths), COVID-19 (3 patient), and 
delirium (1 death)]. None of the Grade 5 AEs were assessed as related to glofitamab by the 
investigator.

Serious Adverse Events  
The most common Serious AEs by SOC were Immune system disorders, Infections and infestations, 
and Blood and lymphatic system disorders.  
These SOCs correspond to the most common SAE PTs in the primary and extended safety populations.  
The most frequent was CRS. Other SAEs reported in ≥ 3 patients included sepsis, COVID-19 including 
pneumonia, tumor flare, anemia, febrile neutropenia, and neutropenia.

Haematology 
In the extended safety populations, the most frequent treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 worsening 
hematological laboratory parameter (apart from decreases in lymphocytes as expected based on the 
MoA) were decreases in neutrophils and which were comparable to the overall safety population and 
the primary safety population.

Elevated liver function tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (> 3 x ULN) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin 
(> 2 x ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia was 
considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury, as defined by Hy’s law. 
There were 14 potential Hy’s Law cases in the “glofitamab doses ≥0.60 mg” population (=Extended 
safety population 3, see Table 1 in the safety introduction, N=467).  
From the narratives it seems that 4 patients had PD and 10 patients had CRS as the probable cause of 
the elevated liver function tests fulfilling Hy’s Law in the overall safety population (N=469). Of the 
CHMP assessment report

seven patients in the population receiving the RP2D fulfilling Hy’s Law three had PD and four had CRS 
as the probable cause. Elevated liver function tests fulfilling Hy’s Law regularly occur in conjunction 
with CRS events (from Grade 1).

Prior CAR-T Therapy 
In the primary safety population, the adverse event PTs that occurred at a higher frequency among 
patients who had received prior CAR-T therapy were thrombocytopenia (11.8% vs. 3.9%) and 
lymphopenia (9.8% vs. 1.0%) (Table 2), which have been reported in other studies after CAR-T 
therapy (Wudhikarn et al., 2020; Strati et al. 2021). The proportion of patients experiencing an AE in 
the SOC Infections and infestations were comparable.  
The most common SAE in the primary safety population was CRS with a higher proportion of patients 
who received prior CAR-T therapy experiencing serious CRS events (29.4% vs. 18.4%) compared to 
patients who had not received prior CAR-T therapy.

Not applicable 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This application seeks conditional marketing authorisation for glofitamab for the treatment of adult 
patients with R/R diffuse large B-cell-lymphoma (DLBCL) who have received at least two prior systemic 
therapies based on results from Study NP30179. 
The safety data for glofitamab IV for the treatment of R/R DLBCL (≥2 prior lines of systemic therapy) 
are from the ongoing, single-arm, uncontrolled, clinical trial NP30179 (updated data with a CCOD 15 
June 2022). There is currently no post marketing experience with glofitamab and no data from other 
clinical trials supporting this Application. 
The primary safety population after the first round was the updated results from 154 patients in the 
D3+D5 cohorts with R/R DLBCL (≥2 prior therapies) having received the recommended dose of 
2.5/10/30 mg.   The general definition of the safety population are all patients receiving at least one 
dose of the experimental treatment being investigated. In this case the experimental treatment is 
glofitamab and obinutuzumab is considered as supportive treatment (and is not included in the 
indication). It appears that 9/154 patients in the primary safety population did not receive any 
glofitamab, however it was argued that obinutuzumab pretreatment (Gpt) is an integral part of the 
proposed glofitamab treatment regimen and considered an essential measure for mitigating the risk of 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS) induced by glofitamab, thereby maintaining a positive benefit/risk 
balance for glofitamab. Glofitamab monotherapy without Gpt has not been evaluated in clinical studies; 
there is no patient experience with glofitamab in the monotherapy setting without Gpt. Despite the fact 
that glofitamab has not been given without obinutuzumab, the efficacy of obinutuzumab to prevent 
CRS is currently not considered demonstrated. Obinutuzumab has a well-known safety profile whereas 
glofitamab is a new medicine, and it is thus considered pertinent to focus on the adverse events of 
glofitamab and to avoid dilution of the AE frequencies by obinutuzumab particularly for early adverse 
events such as CRS.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 139/158 
 
 
 
 
Safety results are presented for the 145 patients who received at least one dose of obinutuzumab and 
glofitamab based on the 15 June 2022 CCOD alongside the results for the initial primary safety 
population (N = 154 patients who received at least one dose of obinutuzumab and potentially 
glofitamab), for ease of comparison. No major differences in the Adverse events frequencies between 
the two populations (N= 145 and N=154) were seen except for CRS which is considered related to 
glofitamab and which occurs in the first treatment cycle. Therefore, in the following the updated AE 
frequencies from the last round has been kept in line with the tables presented in the overview.  
The main supportive safety population are the 469 R/R NHL patients having received ≥ 0.6 mg 
glofitamab with a subpopulation of 195 R/R NHL patients having received the recommended dose 
(Extended safety population 1, see table in the Safety introduction section). In this population safety 
was assessed in all B-NHL histologies (patients with the already mentioned DLBCL histologies, patient 
with Grades 1-3b follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma). 
In general, the proportion of patients with HGBCL and PMBCL enrolled in this study is very small. 
Therefore, no specific statement can be made regarding safety in these subgroups. However, in 
general the disease characteristics are considered representative of the proposed indication. 
For the primary safety population (N = 154) at the 15 June 2022 CCOD, the median number of cycles 
of glofitamab received was 5.0 (range: 1-13 cycles), with 61.4% of patients receiving less than 8 
cycles and 29.7% of patients receiving 12 cycles of treatment, and median treatment duration was 
79.0 days (range: 1-326 days).  
The demographic data and baseline characteristics are considered representative for the proposed 
indication in general. The safety pool is similar/balanced between the primary safety population and 
the overall safety population and the number of treated subjects representing the proposed indication 
(145 subjects) is considered sufficient for a preliminary safety profile. However, it needs to be 
considered that the cancer histologies varies between the cohorts and that not all cancer histologies 
and races are sufficiently represented in this study to make a clinical meaningful assessment in these 
subpopulations. For example, the proportion of patients with HGBCL and PMBCL enrolled in this study 
is very small. In addition, the demographic and baseline characteristics of Cohort D5, differ from the 
other two subgroups comprising the primary safety population. The Cohort D5 included patients with a 
higher median age, higher proportion of females, higher percentage of non-Hispanic patients and a 
higher percentage of patients with trFL and a lower percentage of patients with PMBCL and HGBCL.  
In both the primary and the overall safety population, the median number of prior lines of cancer 
therapy per subject was 3 and all patients had received two or more prior lines of cancer therapy. 
Almost all patients had received chemotherapy and anti-CD-20 monoclonal antibody therapy as 
previous cancer therapy in the primary safety population and overall safety population respectively. 
Also, patients with prior CAR-T cell therapy were included in the study. The majority of the patients 
were refractory or relapsed to any prior therapy.  
Based on the currently provided safety data by sex, a potential effect that males have a higher safety 
risk than females cannot be excluded and the applicant has committed to monitoring this. The 
applicant has also committed to provide the final safety analyses post-approval. It is very clear, 
though, that the main safety issue is the occurrence and management of CRS and related events 
followed by adverse events related to infection including neutropenia. 
Key safety findings:  
The SOCs in the primary safety population (N=154) in which adverse events were most frequently 
reported included Immune system disorders (65.8%), driven mainly by (cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS; 62%% although 68% by ASTCT 2019 for the smaller safety population of 145 patients, where 
patients only having received obinutuzumab have been removed), Blood and lymphatic system

disorders [50.7%; the most frequent PTs being neutropenia (32.9%), anemia (28.3%), and 
thrombocytopenia (20.4%)], and General disorders and administration site conditions [41.4%; the 
most frequent PTs being pyrexia (18.4%), fatigue (9.9%), and asthenia (7.2%)]. Thus, overall, the 
AEs mainly relate to immune-related issues and cytopenias. Infections are also of particular interest for 
patients with haematological malignancies, and for the SOC Infections and Infestations 40.3% 
(62/154) had at least one adverse event and 18.2% (28/154) experienced at least one SAE in this 
SOC.  
The most frequent cause of death in the primary safety population (n=154) irrespective of time point 
was progressive disease, which accounted for 61 deaths (75.3%), followed by 9 AEs [COVID-19 
pneumonia (3 deaths), sepsis (2 deaths), COVID-19 (3 patients), and delirium (1 death)]. None of the 
Grade 5 AEs were assessed as related to glofitamab by the investigator. 
The incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) in the Extended safety population 2 (R/R NHL ≥  1 prior line who 
received 2.5/10/30 mg glofitamab, N=236) was 50.8%, comparable to the primary safety population; 
75/154 (48.7%). Not unexpectedly, the most frequent SAE in the primary safety population was CRS 
[32/154 (20.8%) by ASTCT] and 64/236 (27.1%) in the Extended safety population 2. For the safety 
population excluding patients having only received obinutuzumab (N=145) the SAE for CRS was 
32/145 (22.1% - see Table 1 in the introduction to adverse events). In the SOC Infections and 
infestations 28/154 (18.2%) and 46/236 (19.5%) respectively, experienced at least one SAE.  
In the primary safety population (n=154), 14 patients (9.1%) reported an AE leading to any study 
treatment discontinuation, whereas in the Extended safety population 2 16/236 (6.8%) discontinued 
due to an AE.   
Of the 236 patients who received glofitamab step-up dosing 2.5/10/30 mg, 56 patients (23.7%) 
reported an AE leading to dose interruption/modification of study treatment. Preferred terms from 
the SOCs Blood and lymphatic disorder, Infections and infestations, and Immune system disorders 
(CRS) were the most frequent events.  
Adverse events of special interest 
For the primary safety population (n=154) CRS AEs of any grade were reported in 103 patients 
(66.9% by Lee et al 2014). The corresponding number for the Extended safety population 2 (n=236) 
was 162 (68.6%). For the safety population excluding patients having only received obinutuzumab 
(N=145) the SAE for CRS of any grade was 102/145 (70.3% by ASCTC).   
In the initial primary safety population (n=154) a total of 47/154 patients (30.5% based on ASTCT 
2019) experienced multiple CRS AEs, and the corresponding number for the Extended safety 
population 2 was 72/236 (30.5%). 
For the primary safety population (n=154) serious CRS AEs were experienced by 22.1% by Lee et al..  
In the primary safety population (N=154) ICU admission was required for 7/99 patients (7.1%) and 
31.5% required tocilizumab, 28 patients (28.3%) used corticosteroids, and 16 patients (16.2%) used 
both tocilizumab and corticosteroids to treat CRS.  
Tumour flare of any grade was reported in 17/154 patients (11.0%) and for ≥ Grade 2 in 11/154 
patients (7.1%) in the primary safety population. Tumour flare occurred most frequently in Cycle 1 
(16/17 patients) and 1/17 in Cycle 2 with a median time to onset of 2.00 days (range: 1.0-16.0 days). 
The median duration of Grade ≥ 2 tumour flare was 5.50 days (range: 1.0 – 27.0). Nine of 11 patients 
(N=154) received treatment for tumour flare. 
In the primary safety population, 22 of 154 patients (14.3%) treated with glofitamab step-up dosing 
experienced a Grade ≥ 2 neurological AE. Of these 22 patients, 18 patients reported a Grade 2

event, 2 patients reported a Grade 3 event, one patient reported Grade 4 myelitis (onset of 76.2 hours 
following the C1D15 10 mg glofitamab dose – see the SAE section), and one patient experienced a 
Grade 5 (fatal) event of delirium (which was not assessed as related to glofitamab but to pain/pain-
treatment and PD).  
In the primary safety population, 11 of 154 patients (7.1%) experienced Grade ≥ 2 ALT, AST, or 
total bilirubin elevation (Grade 2: 5 patients and Grade 3: 6 patients). 7 patients (4.5%) had at 
least one unresolved or ongoing AE at the CCOD of 15 June 2022. There is no clear indication that 
glofitamab was the cause of the unresolved hepatic enzyme or bilirubin increases; the reason these 
cases had not resolved were most likely PD.  
Higher AEs were seen in male patients. Possible explanations are imbalances in baseline patient 
characteristics between the sex groups, the higher proportion of male patients enrolled, and the 
increased risk of death associated with male and advanced age lymphoma patients who contract 
COVID-19, may have contributed to the higher incidence of deaths, fatal AEs, severe AEs, and AEs 
leading to withdrawal from study drug and CRS in males compared with female patients. However, 
based on the currently provided safety data by sex, a potential effect that males have a higher safety 
risk than females cannot be excluded so far. The applicant has committed to monitoring safety in male 
patients versus female patients and present the data in Periodic Safety Update Reports 
(PSURs)/Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRERs) and also to provide an updated analysis by 
gender at the time of the Study NP30179 Update Clinical Study Report due Q4 2024.

2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the preliminary safety profile of glofitamab appears to be manageable. Considering the 
advanced nature of the disease and the pre-treated patient population under investigation, the 
preliminary safety profile seems to be acceptable. Updated data has alleviated most of the concerns 
raised.  The ongoing phase 3 study (Glofitamab-GemOx vs. R-GemOx in R/R DLBCL NOS), outlined as 
a specific obligation for conditional marketing authorisation, is expected to further clarify safety issues 
that are difficult to evaluate in a SAT.

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.2 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 24.03.2023. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Columvi (glofitamab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Columvi as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For patients with R/R DLBCL having failed at least two prior lines of therapy, the therapeutic options 
are somewhat limited. A steady stream of new treatments has been approved since 2018 with scant 
availability of evidence to support any particular treatment over the others or to aid in the rational 
sequencing of treatments. Regardless of treatment, the prognosis is quite poor with CR-rates between 
approximately 30-50%. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
NP30179 is a single-arm, ongoing, first-in-human, multicenter, multicohort, open-label, Phase I/II 
dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of glofitamab as monotherapy with a single 1000 mg dose of 
obinutuzumab/Gazyvaro given as pre-treatment (Gpt) in patients with R/R NHL. 
D3 (N=108) was the cohort that supports the therapeutic indication in R/R DLBCL after ≥2 prior 
treatments. The primary efficacy endpoint in this cohort was CR by independent central review (ICR). 
Duration of complete response (DOCR) and time from first treatment to CR (TFCR) –both by IRC– were 
the key secondary endpoints. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy cohort D3 had a CR-rate (by IRC) of 35.2% (95% CI: 26.2, 45.0) (CCOD 15 June 
2022). The median duration of CR was not reached. For complete responders, the median time from 
first treatment to CR was 42.0 days (95% CI: 41.0, 48.0). Patients previously having failed CAR-T 
treatment, patients receiving glofitamab post autologous stem cell transplant therapy and those who 
were refractory to their last line of treatment (all of which represent difficult-to-treat patient 
categories) achieved 32%, 56% and 29% CR-rates, respectively. The median DOCR extended beyond 
the duration of treatment, suggesting that some patients achieve disease control.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The study was designed as a Phase 1 dose-finding and dose escalation study without the required rigor 
usually requested for confirmatory trials (adequate pre-specification of key elements, appropriate type 
1 error control, blinded and independent decision making, randomized control arm, etc) and was 
amended 10 times changing its nature from a Phase 1 to a Phase 1/2 (and finally “confirmatory”) 
study.  
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation is

agreed. In the context of the specific obligations the applicant will provide the updated study report for 
study NP30179. The applicant will submit the results from a phase III study GO41944 as a specific 
obligation. The study is ongoing and recruitment has progressed (data as of 08 November 2022). The 
SOB is planned to be fulfilled by Q3 2024. 
All 3 patients with CD20-negative disease had progressive disease as their best response to 
glofitamab. Overall, concern still remains that the clinical context in which glofitamab is given (in 
patients, all of whom have been exposed to prior CD20-targeted therapy) predisposes to development 
of resistance to CD20-targeted agents and it does not seem that glofitamab retains anti-lymphoma 
activity in CD20-negative lymphomas. This uncertainty, is reflected as a warning at 4.4 in the SmPC: 
There are limited data available on patients with CD20-negative DLBCL treated with Columvi, and it is 
possible that patients with CD20-negative DLBCL may have less benefit compared to patients with 
CD20-positive DLBCL. The potential risks and benefits associated with treatment of patients with 
CD20-negative DLBCL with Columvi should be considered. The efficacy of Columvi has not been 
established in patients with CD20-negative disease who have relapsed from prior anti-CD20 therapy. 
Further, the applicant will provide the final list of CD20 expression in Study NP30179 for the entire 
Cohort D3 with evaluable CD20 and to correlate expression with response to glofitamab at the time of 
the 2 years follow-up from the end of treatment of the last patient enrolled in the primary safety 
population. The applicant will measure CD20 expression and correlate this to response and risk of CRS 
in the ongoing SOB phase III trial NCT04408638/ Study GO41944 (R-GemOx vs Glofit-GemOx in 2L+ 
DLBCL NOS). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The SOCs in the primary safety population (N=154) in which adverse events were most frequently 
reported included Immune system disorders (68.2%), driven mainly by cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS; 62%% although 68% by ASTCT 2019 for the smaller safety population of 145 patients, where 
patients only having received obinutuzumab have been removed), Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders [55.8%; the most frequent PTs being neutropenia (35.7%), anaemia (30.5%), and 
thrombocytopenia (21.4). Thus, overall, the AEs mainly relate to immune-related issues and 
cytopenias. Infections are also of particular interest for patients with haematological malignancies, and 
for the SOC Infections and Infestations 40.3% (62/154) had at least one adverse event and 18.2% 
(28/154) experienced at least one SAE in this SOC. 
The most frequent cause of death in the primary safety population (n=154) irrespective of time point 
was progressive disease, which accounted for 61 deaths (78.3%), followed by 9 AEs [COVID-19 
pneumonia (3 deaths), sepsis (2 deaths), COVID-19 (3 patients), and delirium (1 death)]. None of the 
Grade 5 AEs were assessed as related to glofitamab by the investigator. 
The incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) in the Extended safety population 2 (R/R NHL ≥  1 prior line who 
received 2.5/10/30 mg glofitamab, N=236) was 50.8%, comparable to the primary safety population; 
75/154 (48.7%). Not unexpectedly, the most frequent SAE in the primary safety population was CRS 
[32/154 (20.8%) by ASTCT] and 64/236 (27.1%) in the Extended safety population 2. For the safety 
population excluding patients having only received obinutuzumab (N=145) the SAE for CRS was 
32/145 (22.1% - see Table 1 in the introduction to adverse events).  In the SOC Infections and 
infestations 28/154 (18.2%) and 46/236 (19.5%) respectively, experienced at least one SAE.  
In the primary safety population (n=154), 14 patients (9.1%) reported an AE leading to any study 
treatment discontinuation, whereas in the alternative Extended safety population 2 16/236 (6.8%) 
discontinued due to an AE. The added 1 patient discontinued due to COVID-19 infection. Of the 236 
patients who received glofitamab step-up dosing 2.5/10/30 mg, 56 patients (23.7%) reported an AE 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 149/158 
 
 
 
leading to dose interruption/modification of study treatment. Preferred terms from the SOCs Blood 
and lymphatic disorder, Infections and infestations, and Immune system disorders (CRS) were the 
most frequent events.  
For the primary safety population (n=154) CRS AEs of any grade were reported in 103 patients 
(66.9% by Lee et al 2014). The corresponding number for the Extended safety population 2 (n=236) 
was 162 (68.6%). For the safety population excluding patients having only received obinutuzumab 
(N=145) the SAE for CRS of any grade was 102/145 (70.3% by ASCTC).  For the primary safety 
population (n=154) serious CRS AEs were experienced by 22.1% by Lee et al., ICU admission was 
required for 7/99 patients (7.1%) and 31.5% required tocilizumab, 28 patients (28.3%) used 
corticosteroids, and 16 patients (16.2%) used both tocilizumab and corticosteroids to treat CRS.  
Tumour flare of any grade was reported in 17/154 patients (11.0%) and for ≥ Grade 2 in 11/154 
patients (7.1%) in the primary safety population. Tumour flare occurred most frequently in Cycle 1 
(16/17 patients) and 1/17 in Cycle 2 with a median time to onset of 2.00 days (range: 1.0-16.0 days). 
The median duration of Grade ≥ 2 tumour flare was 5.50 days (range: 1.0 – 27.0). Nine of 11 patients 
(N=154) received treatment for tumour flare. At the time of the CCOD, events were resolved in 10 of 
11 patients.  
In the primary safety population, 22 of 154 patients (14.3%) treated with glofitamab step-up dosing 
experienced a Grade ≥ 2 neurological AE. Of these 22 patients, 18 patients reported a Grade 2 
event, 2 patients reported a Grade 3 event, one patient reported Grade 4 myelitis (onset of 76.2 hours 
following the C1D15 10 mg glofitamab dose – see the SAE section), and one patient experienced a 
Grade 5 (fatal) event of delirium (which was not assessed as related to glofitamab but to pain/pain-
treatment and PD). In the primary safety population, 11 of 154 patients (7.1%) experienced Grade ≥ 
2 ALT, AST, or total bilirubin elevation (Grade 2: 5 patients and Grade 3: 6 patients). 7 patients 
(4.5%) had at least one unresolved or ongoing AE at the CCOD of 15 June 2022. There is no clear 
indication that glofitamab was the cause of the unresolved hepatic enzyme or bilirubin increases; in the 
evaluable 6 out of 7 cases the reason these cases had not resolved were most likely PD or in 1 case 
tocilizumab AE. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Given the single-arm trial design, the relatively small safety population (N=154), the short exposure, 
and known risks for other monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 on B-cells and/or CD3 on T-cells, 
uncertainties remain with regards to the CRS, Tumour flare Serious infections Prior CAR-T treatment, 
which are reflected in the Summary of safety concerns of the RMP  
More data on long-term safety are needed; the median exposure was 79 days in the primary safety 
population; treatment may be given for 12 cycles (á 21 days). 
Risk minimisation measures are in place to mitigate the risk of CRS and tumour flare (see Annex II). 
Study BO43309 on the Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Additional Risk Minimisation Measures for 
Glofitamab is a Survey Among Healthcare Professionals in 10 Countries in the European Economic Area 
with the primary objective of this study is to assess, by survey the receipt of the educational materials, 
i.e., HCP brochure (for the important identified risk of TF) and Patient Card (for the important identified 
risk of CRS), by the target population (glofitamab prescribers) and the distribution of the Patient Card 
by prescribers to their patients and behavioral indicators (the level of awareness, knowledge, 
comprehension and adherence) of prescribers with respect to TF information included in the HCP 
brochure. This study will provide more information on Cytokine release syndrome and Tumor Flare (see 
RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is an unmet need for patients with R/R DLBCL who have received ≥2 prior therapies, particularly 
for patients who are R/R to different classes of agents, as they are left with limited treatment options 
that may have challenging safety profiles. 
Results from the single-arm trial NP30179 are encouraging, with 38/108 (35.2%) patients achieving 
CR. Obtaining a CR, which is the disappearance of all measurable evidence of disease, is considered 
relevant for this population in need and indicates a clinically meaningful effect. Results from secondary 
endpoints, in particular DOCR (not reached) support the primary endpoint. 
The main uncertainties regarding the B/R assessment relate to the highly flexible and data-driven 
nature of the study without appropriate pre-specification of key elements such as the pivotal cohort 
and without type 1 error control over the (17) cohorts, a clear rationale for the dose and/or treatment 
regimen, the limited sample size, the short follow-up, and the limitations associated with the single-
arm study design. The updated efficacy data provided in Round 2 assuage some of these uncertainties, 
in particular the demonstration of durable CRs (DOCR not reached) lasting beyond the fixed duration of 
treatment. The short TFCR is considered of benefit in this population of patients with aggressive 
lymphoma as well. Finally, the relatively high CR-rate in patients relapsing after CAR-T treatment is 
considered of benefit. 
The most important safety concerns are CRS, neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, infections, 
neurological adverse events and tumour flare. The adverse events are generally manageable and 
acceptable in this disease population with ominous prognosis and scarce treatment possibilities. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Glofitamab provides a novel mechanism of action, could have potential therapeutic advantage 
compared to available treatments (pending resolution of the concerns raised in this AR), and provides 
durable complete responses, while having a clinically manageable safety profile. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
This being a conditional marketing authorisation the following studies will be submitted as part of the 
specific obligations:

Conclusions 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
Glofitamab is currently being investigated as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies in 
multiple Phase I/II studies and one Phase III open label, randomized (2:1) study in patients with R/R 
DLBCL. The confirmatory study agreed as an SOB for the CMA was discussed during a scientific advice 
procedure in Dec 2019 (EMEA/H/SA/4023/2/2019/III) is: A Phase III Study Evaluating Glofitamab in 
Combination with Gemcitabine + Oxaliplatin vs Rituximab in Combination with Gemcitabine + 
Oxaliplatin in Participants with Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, ClinicalTrials.gov 
Identifier: NCT04408638/ Study GO41944. The study is ongoing and recruitment has progressed. It 
should be noted that patients are eligible for this study as second-line treatment (as opposed to the 
current application which is third-line or higher). In addition, the only LBCL subtype that is eligible is 
DLBCL NOS (meaning that no further data on the efficacy of glofitamab in trFL, HGBCL and PMBCL will 
be provided by this study). The update on enrolment is reassuring for the feasibility of the trial. 
•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as glofitamab has shown consistent and durable complete 
responses and significant overall response rate in the targeted population who were refractory to 
other options, while having a clinically manageable safety profile. 
The current treatment landscape of R/R DLCBL contains numerous options which makes the 
demonstration of unmet medical need particularly important for considering granting a CMA. The 
applicant has satisfactorily provided evidence of MTA over polatuzumab vedotin (+BR), CAR-T 
therapies and pixantrone which have a full MA. In comparison to a recent CMA approval of Zynlonta, 
glofitamab addresses the unmet medical need to a similar extent. 
The applicant has provided indirect comparisons of glofitamab against published results for other 
available treatments in the R/R DLBCL setting including the fully approved CAR-T treatments Yescarta, 
Kymriah, and Breyanzi as well as the monoclonal antibody conjugate Polivy (in combination with 
rituximab and bendamustine) – full approval was recently granted for Polivy in place of CMA. In 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 153/158 
 
 
 
 
addition, the cytotoxic Pixuvri is fully approved. Furthermore, comparisons with the conditionally 
approved targeted treatment Minjuvi (in combination with lenalidomide) is provided. Finally, 
comparisons between glofitamab and rituximab-chemotherapy combinations are mentioned.    
Compared to CAR-T therapies (Yescarta, Kymriah, Breyanzi), glofitamab is immediately available, 
whereas, due to the complex manufacturing of CAR-Ts, their distribution and the need for intense 
monitoring this treatment modality is currently limited to specialized tertiary centers and for patients 
who are well enough to withstand the delays in receiving an active treatment, as delays which are 
inherent in the preparation of a CAR-T product could potentially be detrimental to a R/R DLBCL patient.  
Columvi will present a treatment for immediate administration to the patient. Further, Columvi has 
demonstrated efficacy in patients who have failed CAR-T treatment. 
Compared to Polivy+BR, in terms of efficacy, Polivy+BR (in 3L+) and glofitamab (also 3L+) 
demonstrate similar CR-rates (31% and 35%, respectively) in their respective studies in r/r DLBCL, 
while the DOR of glofitamab (14.4 months) was numerically longer than that of Polivy+BR (10.3 
months). Such numbers, while not formally demonstrating MTA, indicate that Glofitamab will provide 
meaningful clinical effects in patients with R/R DLBCL NOS, and thus constitute an additional treatment 
option in this non-curative 3L+ setting. 
The sequencing of Polivy+BR and glofitamab has not been explicitly studied. There is, however, some 
evidence of effect of glofitamab after CAR-T (CR 32% & ORR 45%, n = 38), while Polivy+BR has yet to 
demonstrate effect in this setting (CR 0% & ORR 33%, n = 6). Considering that CAR-T treatment is 
moving from 3L+ to 2L in R/R (D)LBCL, and as such a greater proportion of patients needing 3L+ 
treatment will have been previously exposed to CAR-T, this is an important advantage over the 
treatment management of DLBCL. Of note, although some patients in the pivotal (D3) cohort for 
glofitamab had previously been treated with Polivy-containing regimens, no current knowledge is 
available on the efficacy of glofitamab after Polivy+BR. 
In terms of clinical safety it is difficult to compare the prevalence of specific adverse events in 
Polivy+BR treated vs glofitamab treated cohorts in a meaningful way without any direct comparative 
studies. However, the studies record substantially different rates of AEs associated with the particular 
mechanisms of action of Polivy and glofitamab. Peripheral neuropathy is characteristic of tubulin 
targeting agents such as the vedotin toxin of Polivy, and was seen in 31% in Polivy+BR treated 
patients, whereas it was only reported in 2% of those treated with glofitamab. Moreover CRS, which is 
characteristic of T-cell engagers, is seen in 64% of those treated glofitamab and not reported for 
Polivy+BR. Although it cannot be stated that one product is safer than the other, CRS is treatable and 
reversible, while neuropathy may be irreversible. Based on this, glofitamab has a safety advantage 
over Polivy+BR due to the abovementioned differential ADR profiles resulting from the respective 
mechanisms of action.  
Based on the above, it is concluded that glofitamab provides a major therapeutic advantage over 
Polivy+BR due to the lack of peripheral neuropathies. Additionally, compared to Polivy+BR, glofitamab 
provides advantage in terms of an additional line of treatment after patients have failed CAR-T 
treatment. 
In terms of MTA over Pixuvri; Pixantrone (in 3L+) demonstrated a CR-rate of 11% compared to 
glofitamab which demonstrated a CR-rate of 35%, in the R/R DLBCL setting. The DOR was 7 vs 14.4 
months for Pixuvri and glofitamab, respectively. With regards to Pixuvri, it can be accepted that the 
activity of this compound is limited and a major therapeutic advantage of Columvi over pixantrone in 
terms of efficacy may be inferred.  
Although the sequencing of Pixuvri and glofitamab has not been studied, it is very likely that nearly all 
DLBCL NOS patients eligible for 3L+ treatment will have received anthracycline drugs as part of 1st 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 154/158 
 
 
 
line therapy (most commonly in the form of doxorubicin as part of R-CHOP chemo or variations 
thereof). The main exception would be patients with known heart failure at the time of diagnosis and 
these patients would not be candidates for pixantrone treatment in any case. Total (life-time) 
cumulative anthracycline dose is typically capped in order to minimize the risk of heart failure. That 
means that sequencing of Pixuvri after 1st (and potentially 2nd) line treatment containing 
anthracycline is problematic as it is the cumulative dose of anthracycline that determines the risk of 
heart failure. Therefore, it can be considered that glofitamab has a therapeutic advantage over 
pixantrone since it can be given to patients who have met (or are close to) their maximum allowed 
anthracycline limit (likely a large proportion of the 3L+ cohort). 
It is difficult to compare the prevalence of specific adverse events in Pixuvri treated vs glofitamab 
treated cohorts in a meaningful way without any direct comparative studies. However, the studies 
record different rates of AEs associated with the particular mechanisms of action of Pixuvri and 
glofitamab. Cardiac failure, a well-described risk of anthracycline drugs, was found in 8.8% of Pixuvri-
treated patients vs 1.3% of glofitamab treated patients. Moreover CRS, which is characteristic of T-cell 
engagers, is seen in 64% of those treated with glofitamab and not reported for Pixuvri. Although it 
cannot be stated that one product is safer than the other, CRS is treatable and reversible, while 
anthracycline-induced heart failure may be irreversible. Based on this, glofitamab has a safety 
advantage over Pixuvri due to the abovementioned differential ADR profiles resulting from the 
respective mechanisms of action. 
Based on the above, glofitamab provides a major therapeutic advantage over Pixuvri due to the lack of 
risk of cardiac failure. Additionally, compared to Pixuvri, glofitamab provides advantage in terms of an 
additional line of treatment regardless of previous cumulative anthracycline dose received.  
In order to shed light on the effects of sequencing of glofitamab after Pola+CHP, Pola+BR and Pixuvri, 
the applicant was requested to provide the number of patients in the pivotal cohort D3 having 
previously received one or more of the abovementioned therapies along with the responses these 
patients then achieved on glofitamab treatment. The limited number of patients available to investigate 
the sequencing of glofitamab after regimens containing either polatuzumab (n=6 patients) or 
pixantrone (n=2 patients) preclude any conclusions on glofitamab efficacy in these settings being 
drawn. 
While clinically relevant activity has been shown for products approved in 3L+, comparing the relative 
impact of these medicinal products on time-dependent endpoints is fraught with uncertainty due to 
cross-study comparisons of relatively small studies. 
Compared to the conditionally approved product Minjuvi, glofitamab offers a similar level of efficacy 
and exhibits a comparable safety profile, suggesting that glofitamab fulfils the unmet medical need to a 
similar extent.  
Compared  to  the  conditionally  approved  Zynlonta  Based  on  the  evidence  available,  glofitamab  offers 
benefit  over  zynlonta  in  terms  of  a  shorter  duration  of  treatment,  the  advantage  in  the  subset  of 
patients  who  have  previously  been  treated  with  anti-CD19  directed  therapy  (primarily  CAR-T)  and  a 
different  safety  profile.  Efficacy  is  potentially  better  although  this  is  difficult  to  conclusively  ascertain 
based  on  comparisons  between  two  single-arm  trials.  It  is  assessed  that  glofitamab  addresses  the 
unmet medical need to a similar extent. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
Based on the aggressiveness of, and poor prognosis associated with, R/R DLBCL as well as the fact 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/228393/2023  
Page 155/158 
 
 
 
 
that the risk-benefit balance of Columvi is positive, it is agreed that the benefits to public health of 
immediate availability outweigh the risks. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Columvi is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Columvi is not similar to Kymriah, Yescarta, Minjuvi and 
Polivy within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Columvi is favourable in the following indication: 
Columvi as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the

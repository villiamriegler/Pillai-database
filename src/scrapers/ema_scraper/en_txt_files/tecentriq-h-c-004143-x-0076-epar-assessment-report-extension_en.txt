2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Tecentriq (atezolizumab), available as a concentrate for solution (60 mg/mL) for intravenous (IV) 
infusion, is approved in EU at dosing regimens of 840 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), 1200 mg every 3 
weeks (Q3W), 1680 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) as single agent and/or in combination for the treatment 
of urothelial carcinoma (UC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Atezolizumab is infused over a 
period of 60 minutes for the initial infusion. Subsequent infusions may be delivered in 30 minutes if the 
previous infusion was tolerated. The usage of IV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with the observation 
time required after infusion has placed a strain on medical centres with respect to chair time and time 
and resources required to prepare and administer the infusion (De Cock et al, PLOS ONE 2016).   
Additionally, the required procedure to establish IV access in a patient is considered invasive. PD-L1 
inhibitors are usually given for long periods of time at least in the adjuvant settings.

2.2.  About the product 
Atezolizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody consisting of two heavy 
chains (448 amino acids) and two light chains (214 amino acids) and is produced in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells.  
Atezolizumab SC formulation contains the recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) at a 
concentration of 2,000 U/mL, an enzyme used to increase the dispersion and absorption of co-
administered drugs when administered subcutaneously. 
Mode of action: Atezolizumab targets human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumour 
infiltrating immune cells (ICs) and tumour cells (TCs) and inhibits its interaction with its receptors 
programmed death1 (PD-1) and B7.1, both of which can provide inhibitory signals to T cells. 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. 
Claimed indications: 
Atezolizumab SC at 1875 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) will be indicated in all current dosing regimens of 
atezolizumab IV: 840 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), 1200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W), 1680 mg every 4 
weeks (Q4W) as single agent and/or in combination with chemotherapy (ies) for the treatment of 
urothelial carcinoma (UC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
Atezolizumab SC formulation is administered subcutaneously, as a fixed non-weight-based dose, which 
is similar to the approved atezolizumab IV formulation. Atezolizumab SC was developed to offer 
patients a less invasive and faster administration of atezolizumab compared to atezolizumab IV 
infusion 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The development programme/compliance with guidance/scientific advice 
The underlying principle of the clinical development program (CDP) of the atezolizumab SC is that the 
atezolizumab active ingredient in the SC administration is identical to the active ingredient in the IV 
formulation. The CDP is based on the scientific consideration that atezolizumab serum trough 
concentrations (Ctrough) after SC administration are at least as high as those Ctrough after IV infusion in 
conjunction with a model-predicted area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), resulting in a 
comparable degree of target-site saturation and thus comparable degree of efficacy, regardless of the 
route of administration. 
Prior to start of the randomised study IMscin001, the MAH sought scientific advice from the CHMP in 
two occasions, with two follow-up scientific advices in 2018 and 2020, to support the registration of 
atezolizumab SC formulation. 
Overall, it is considered that the MAH has followed relevant CHMP guidance. Minor deviations found in 
the assessment of study data will be addressed in specific sections. 
The Paediatric Committee (PDCO) recommended granting a product specific waiver for all subsets of 
the paediatric population for the treatment of all conditions included in the category of malignant 
neoplasms (except central nervous system tumours, hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue neoplasms and 
melanoma).

General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
The references nonclinical repeat dose study was performed in 2009, and was deemed to be compliant 
with GLP during the initial MAA. No new NC studies were performed in support of the of the current line 
extension to include an SC formulation of atezolizumab, including rHuPh20. The pivotal safety and 
toxicity studies were all submitted in support of the MAA for IV administration.  
No GMP issues have been identified during assessment of the atezolizumab dossier, which call for a 
pre-approval inspection. 
The MAH claims that the clinical studies in the application were conducted per Good Clinical Practices 
(GCP). No further request for GCP inspection is considered necessary at the moment. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This line extension application includes the registration of a new strength (1875 mg), new 
pharmaceutical form (solution for injection) and new route of administration (subcutaneous (SC) use). 
Atezolizumab finished product (also referred to as FP) for subcutaneous administration (atezolizumab-
SC) is a sterile, colourless-to-slightly yellow solution without preservatives. It is supplied in a 20 mL 
single-dose vials which contains 1875 mg/15 mL atezolizumab. Atezolizumab is formulated with 
recombinant hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), an enzyme used to increase the dispersion and absorption of 
co-formulated substances when administered subcutaneously.  rHuPH20 is not a novel excipient. The 
other excipients include L-histidine, acetic acid, sucrose, polysorbate 20, L-methionine and water for 
injections. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Atezolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody based on a human IgG1 framework expressed in 
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and consists of two heavy chains (448 amino acid residues each) 
and two light chains (214 amino acid residues each). The structure of atezolizumab-SC active 
substance (also referred to as AS) is the same as that for the approved commercial atezolizumab for 
intravenous administration (atezolizumab-IV) AS.  
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of the Manufacturing process and process controls 
The atezolizumab-SC AS is manufactured at Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany (PZ). 
Cell culture and harvest  
Atezolizumab is produced in a fed batch process. The source of cells is the Working Cell Bank (WCB), 
which is derived from the Master Cell Bank (MCB). The cell culture process involves three stages: WCB 
thaw and seed train, inoculum train, and production culture. Upon completion of the production 
culture, atezolizumab in the cell culture fluid is physically separated from the cells by harvesting via 
centrifugation and filtration.  
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 11/114 
 
 
 
 
Purification  
Atezolizumab in the harvested cell culture fluid is initially purified by affinity chromatography, the 
recovered low pH pool is held to ensure potential viruses are inactivated, the pH adjusted affinity pool 
is further purified over a cation and anion chromatography step, and the pH adjusted anion exchange 
pool is filtered over a virus removal filter. The final steps in the AS purification process (concentration 
of the product, conditioning and buffer exchange) ensures a AS concentration of 125 mg/mL 
atezolizumab in L-histidine acetate, sucrose, L-methionine, polysorbate 20, pH 5.8. The conditioned 
UF/DF pool is filtered into a 300 L freeze/thaw (F/T) vessel to produce the atezolizumab-SC AS, frozen, 
and stored at ≤ −20 ˚C.  
Control of critical steps 
To ensure the quality of the active substance, in-process controls (IPCs) have been established. IPC 
tests and limits apply to the cell culture and harvest process steps and the purification process step.   
Control of materials 
Atezolizumab is produced using a stably transfected CHO cell line. One of the clones resulting from this 
transfection was selected as the host cell for production cell-line construction. A two-tier cell banking 
system of master cell bank and working cell bank was developed and characterised in accordance with 
ICH guidelines.  
Process validation 
The atezolizumab-IV process has been previously validated and used for commercial supply since 
2017. Thus, many of the validation studies performed for the atezolizumab-IV process are considered 
applicable to atezolizumab-SC.  
Process characterisation and validation (PC/PV) studies were designed to demonstrate manufacturing 
process consistency for relevant product quality attributes for process parameters. These studies 
include a combination of qualified scale-down models and equipment and site-specific validation 
studies conducted at manufacturing scales.  
The results from characterisation studies are used to identify critical process parameters (CPPs) and 
support acceptable parameter ranges for commercial production. These studies were designed based 
on process understanding developed during process development, platform knowledge, and scientific 
and engineering principles. 
Manufacturing process development 
Different versions of active substance manufacturing processes were used during development of 
atezolizumab-SC. The manufacturing process is based on the Applicant’s CHO antibody manufacturing 
platform. 
The process changes occurring during development have been assessed for impact to product quality, 
and the atezolizumab manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site has been demonstrated to 
be comparable to the material used for clinical trials.

2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specification 
The release specifications for atezolizumab-SC AS have been suitably justified and are supported by 
consistent data from multiple batches. The specifications contain tests for pharmacopoeial methods as 
well as specific methods to ensure sufficient safety and quality with respect to identity, purity, potency 
and other general tests.  
Analytical procedures  
A description of the analytical procedures used for the testing of AS have been provided and 
summarised. Reference material 
Atezolizumab-SC AS utilises the same reference standard as atezolizumab-IV AS 
A two-tiered approach was established for the commercial Reference Standard whereby the primary 
Reference Standard will be used to qualify future Reference Standards. The secondary Reference 
Standard is used as the working Reference Standard for testing of the active substance and finished 
product in all assays requiring a Reference Standard. Qualification of the commercial Reference 
Standards was conducted by release testing and extensive characterisation. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data were provided.Container closure system 
2.4.2.4.  The container closure system is already used for other approved biologics.Stability 
The shelf life claimed for the active substance is 36 months at storage condition ≤ -20˚C based on 
stability data obtained from batches manufactured with clinical and commercial manufacturing 
processes.  
Batches obtained with the clinical manufacturing process are comparable and considered 
representative of the commercial process. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Atezolizumab-SC finished product is provided as a sterile, colourless-to-slightly yellow solution for 
subcutaneous injection, with no preservatives. Each 20 mL single-dose vial contains 1875 mg/15 mL of 
atezolizumab at target pH 5.8. The finished product is consists of 125 mg/mL atezolizumab formulated 
with recombinant hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), an enzyme used to increase the dispersion and absorption 
of co-formulated substances when administered subcutaneously. The other excipients include L-
histidine, acetic acid, sucrose, polysorbate 20, L-methionine and water for injections. . There are no 
novel excipients. The formulation does not contain any antimicrobial-preservative or bacteriostatic 
agents. 
The container closure system consists of a Type I glass vial with a rubber stopper and crimped with an 
aluminium seal fitted with a plastic flip-off cap.  
Pharmaceutical Development

In the atezolizumab-SC finished product, the atezolizumab active substance is formulated at a 
concentration of 125 mg/mL  and is co-formulated with rHuPH20 as an aqueous solution. rHuPH20 
facilitates the subcutaneous injection of larger volumes by acting as a permeation enhancer. A 
comparison of the commercial atezolizumab for intravenous administration (atezolizumab IV) and 
atezolizumab SC formulations was performed. The administration time for atezolizumab-SC finished 
product solution has been reduced to less than 10 minutes compared with the administration time of 
30-60 minutes for the atezolizumab IV finished product solution. 
A comparability exercise was performed and showed that atezolizumab SC batches manufactured with 
the clinical manufacturing process and the commercial manufacturing process are comparable. 
Manufacturing process development  
During development the finished product manufacturing was transferred to a different site. The 
finished product manufacturing process at both sites remained the same with some facility fit 
adaptations.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Description of the process 
Manufacture of atezolizumab-SC finished product is conducted at Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Sandhofer 
Strasse 116, 68305 Mannheim, Germany.  
Atezolizumab-SC finished product is manufactured as a liquid dosage form in vials at the dose strength 
of 1875 mg/vial with nominal fill volume of 15 mL.  
The commercial manufacturing process consists of thawing active substance, addition of rHuPH20 
enzyme, bioburden reduction and sterile filtrations, aseptic filling into glass vials, stoppering, capping 
and crimping, and visual inspection, including vial integrity testing.  
In-process controls composed of action limits and acceptance criteria for manufacture of the finished 
product are in place.  
Process validation  
The finished product process validation was performed on batches manufactured with the commercial 
process at the commercial site. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications 
The specifications for the atezolizumab-SC FP include control of identity, purity and purities, potency, 
activity of rHuPH20 and other general tests. 
Reference material 
The Reference Standard used for finished product release and stability testing is the same as that used 
for the active substance. 
Batch analysis 
All atezolizumab-SC FP batches complied with all release specification that were in place at time of 
testing and also comply with the current proposed commercial specifications.

Container closure system 
The container closure system for FP is adequately described. All product-contacting materials comply 
with relevant pharmacopoeial requirements. The container closure integrity studies demonstrate the 
compatibility of the FP solution with the primary container closure system and the ability of the 
container closure system to protect FP solution from microbial contamination. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 24 months is claimed for atezolizumab-SC FP at the recommended storage condition of 
2˚C - 8˚C when stored in the commercial container closure system, which is stored in the marketing 
pack to protected it from light. The shelf-life is based on stability data from batches considered 
representative of the finished product. 
The proposed shelf life of 24 months for the FP when stored at 2°C - 8°C protected from light is 
accepted. 
Once transferred from the vial into the syringe (provided separately), Tecentriq SC formulation is 
physically and chemically stable for up to 30 days at 2°C to 8°C and for up to 8 hours at ≤ 30°C in 
diffuse daylight and from the time of preparation.  
From a microbiological point of view, the solution should be used immediately once transferred from 
the vial to the syringe since the medicine does not contain any antimicrobial-preservative or 
bacteriostatic agents. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless 
preparation has taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
There are no changes to the adventitious agent safety evaluation. This section remains as approved in 
the MAA for atezolizumab-IV commercial product. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of the dossier presented in support of the line extension application for atezolizumab-SC, is 
considered adequate. From a quality point of view, the benefit/risk ratio is not affected. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Tecentriq SC is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions as defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, this line extension application for Tecentriq to 
add a new strength (1875 mg), new pharmaceutical form (solution for injection) and new route of 
administration (subcutaneous (SC) use) is considered approvable from the quality point of view.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) 
have been thoroughly investigated in nonclinical studies following intravenous (IV) administration 
(refer to European Medicines Agency Marketing Authorization Application Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/004143/0000); study reports cited and results discussed in this section were submitted in 
Module 4 of that application. 
The nonclinical safety of subcutaneous (SC) and IV administration of recombinant human 
hyaluronidase enzyme (rHuPH20) has been extensively characterized in mice and cynomolgus 
monkeys with no relevant toxicological findings in the general toxicity studies. 
The toxicology program was designed to support IV or SC administration of atezolizumab to patients. 
The toxicity and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab following SC administration were well characterized in a 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkey (Study 08-1148). 
Atezolizumab was given via either IV (5 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg) or SC administration (15 
mg/kg or 50 mg/kg) weekly for 8 weeks (9 total doses). The toxicity was assessed for the reversibility 
or persistence of any effects after a 12-week treatment-free recovery period. 
Scientific advice regarding the adequacy of the nonclinical studies performed to support SC formulation 
was given in November 2018, regarding the adequacy of the nonclinical studies performed to support 
the extension. It was concluded at that point in time, that no further animal studies were required. 
Any increased exposure of atezolizumab due to hyaluronidase is covered by repeat-dose toxicity 
studies using the intravenous route of administration. 
The differences in formulations between the non-clinical SC study and the Phase 1 and III clinical 
studies are not considered detrimental for the validity of the SC study in monkeys performed without 
hyaluronidase. 
The non-clinical and clinical safety of hyaluronidase in subcutaneous formulations of monoclonal 
antibodies (e.g. Herceptin) is demonstrated in other products. Hence, it is accepted that the safety of 
the co-administration of atezolizumab and hyaluronidase was confirmed in the clinical setting.  
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is prevalent in many human tumours (Dong et al. 
2002), and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis for patients with any of several 
epithelial cancers (Thompson et al. 2006; Hamanishi et al. 2007; Okazaki and Honjo 2007; Hino et al. 
2010). Elevated expression of PD-L1 on tumour cells has been reported to impede anti-tumour 
immunity, resulting in immune evasion by tumour cells. PD-L1 is one of two ligands that regulate the 
activity of programmed cell death1 (PD-1), an inhibitory receptor that modulates T-cell signalling and 
whose expression is induced on T cells following activation and sustained in sites of chronic stimulation 
such as the tumour microenvironment (Blank and Mackensen 2007). Ligation of PD-1 impairs the 
capacity of chronically activated T cells to proliferate, produce cytokines, or effectively kill target cells 
in response to their cognate antigen. Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets PD-L1 and inhibits its interaction with PD-1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 16/114 
 
 
 
 
Atezolizumab was engineered with an amino acid substitution at position 298, resulting in a 
nonglycosylated antibody, to impair Fcγ receptor binding and to prevent Fc-mediated depletion of cells 
expressing PD-L1.  
In support of the MAA for IV administration, non-clinical in vitro data were submitted to describe the 
pharmacological mode of action of atezolizumab. The studies provide information on binding affinity of 
atezolizumab to its target PD-L1 and on the inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction. Atezolizumab did 
not bind to recombinant PD-L2- Fc, while clear binding was detected with recombinant PD-L1-Fc. The 
lack of Fc functionality due to removal of the N-glycosylation site was demonstrated, except for the 
effect on CDC. The in vivo effect of blocking PD-L1 was adequately evaluated in murine syngeneic 
tumour models using chimeric anti-PD-L1 mAbs. These studies demonstrate that treatment with anti-
PD-L1 mediates an effective anti-tumour response and provide sufficient proof-of-concept. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No specific secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted. In vitro tissue cross-reactivity 
studies were conducted with atezolizumab using a full panel of human and cynomolgus monkey tissues 
(Study 08-1174). In human tissues, biotin-atezolizumab-specific staining was detected in the placenta, 
lymph node, tonsil, and thymus. Frequent, moderate, apical cytoplasmic and membranous staining 
was observed in syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta. Very rare, minimal to mild, cytoplasmic staining 
was observed in sinusoidal cells of lymph nodes and tonsil. Rare to frequent, mild to moderate, 
cytoplasmic staining was observed in thymic cortical and medullary cells. In cynomolgus monkey 
tissues, biotin-atezolizumab-specific staining was detected only in the lymph node. Rare to frequent, 
minimal to moderate, cytoplasmic staining was observed in sinusoidal cells of lymph nodes. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
As stated in the ICH S6(R1) guideline, dedicated safety pharmacology studies are not required for 
biotechnology-derived products (ICH 2011). Accordingly, no dedicated safety pharmacology studies 
evaluating cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, or ophthalmic toxicity were conducted. Although a 
dedicated safety pharmacology study of atezolizumab was not performed, central nervous system, 
cardiovascular (telemetry and/or surface leads), and respiratory safety pharmacology parameters were 
evaluated as part of the 8-week Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) cynomolgus monkey toxicology study 
(08-1148), which included subcutaneous (SC) dosing. No atezolizumab-related changes in central 
nervous system, cardiovascular, or respiratory safety pharmacology parameters were observed. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No stand-alone pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been performed. Pharmacodynamic 
drug-drug interactions (PD DDIs) between a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) and conventional 
small-molecule drugs or other protein therapeutics may happen through two possible mechanisms. 
First, co-administrated immunosuppressive therapeutics may lead to lower incidence of 
immunogenicity and restore the exposure of atezolizumab at low concentration range. Preclinical 
assessment is not relevant since immunogenicity cannot be adequately predicted across species. 
Potential exposure modifications have been closely monitored in clinical setting. The second 
mechanism of PD DDI is the possible target modulation by other therapeutics. The clinically therapeutic 
dose of atezolizumab is within the linear range where the target-mediated disposition is negligible, and 
the impact of target modulation is minimal. Therefore, no pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies 
have been performed.

2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical characterization of the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab is described in previously 
approved dossiers (refer to Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004143). 
No dedicated pharmacokinetic studies with atezolizumab SC have been conducted, however, 
Toxicokinetic evaluation was included in one study (08-1148) submitted in the original MAA for IV 
atezolizumab, also had two dose groups receiving atezolizumab subcutaneously. See repeat dose 
toxicity section (2.5.4.2 below). 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No standalone single dose toxicity studies were performed with the SC formulation of atezolizumab.  
As recommended in ICH guidance M3, no dedicated, single-dose toxicity studies were performed [ICH 
M3(R2) 2013]. However, a high dose was investigated with weekly IV and SC dose administration in 
the 8-week GLP repeat-dose toxicity study (08-1148), and without morbidity or mortality after the first 
dose administration. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
No new studies were performed. In support of the initial MAA for the IV route of administration, one 
study also included two dose groups administered atezolizumab (15 or 50 mg/kg) subcutaneously. No 
absorption enhancing excipient was included in this study. 
In support of the initial MAA, a GLP repeat-dose study (08-1148) was conducted to evaluate the 
toxicity and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab when administered by IV or SC injection to cynomolgus 
monkeys weekly for 8 weeks (9 total doses), and to assess the reversibility, persistence, or delayed 
occurrence of any effects after a 12-week, treatment-free recovery period. 
Seventy-two experimentally naïve cynomolgus monkeys (36 males and 36 females) were divided into 
8 dose groups (n = 3-5/sex/group) and given either atezolizumab Vehicle or atezolizumab once weekly 
for 8 weeks (9 total doses). Animals in Group 1 received an IV and SC bolus dose of atezolizumab 
Vehicle; animals in Groups 2, 3, and 4 received an IV dose of atezolizumab (5, 15, or 50 mg/kg, 
respectively); Groups 5 and 6 received an SC dose of atezolizumab (15 or 50 mg/kg, respectively); 
and Groups 7 and 8 had telemetry units implanted before Day 1 and received IV doses of atezolizumab 
at 0 and 50 mg/kg, respectively. Animals (2 or 3/sex) were necropsied on Day 60 (terminal necropsy) 
or on Day 141 (recovery necropsy), with the exception of animals in the 2 telemetry groups that were 
released to the Testing Facility telemetry colony after Day 141. 
Overall, the serum concentration-time profiles of all dose groups exhibited apparent biphasic 
disposition in which a rapid initial distribution phase was followed by a slower elimination phase. 
Average area under the serum concentration-time curve from Time 0 to Study Day 8 (Toxicokinetic 
[TK] Day 7) (AUC0-7), AUC0-56, and AUC0-140 values for all dose groups are summarized in Table 1. 
Mean AUC0-7 values appeared dose proportional in all dose groups. No differences by sex in the TK 
parameters were observed. Bioavailability of atezolizumab following SC administration of 15 or 50 
mg/kg was estimated to be 54.3% and 51.8%, respectively (see Table 1, under toxicokinetics). 
Weekly IV and SC administration of atezolizumab was well tolerated at dose levels up to 50 mg/kg for 
8 weeks. All animals survived to scheduled necropsy or disposition. Atezolizumab administration had 
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023

no effects on clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, respiratory rate, heart rate, body 
temperature, blood pressure, electrocardiograms, pulse oximetry, physical, neurological, 
ophthalmologic, or cardiovascular examinations, clinical pathology (haematology, serum chemistry, 
coagulation, or urinalysis), immunologic endpoints (immunophenotyping via flow cytometry, serum 
cytokines, anti-nuclear antibodies, or anti-double-stranded [ds] DNA antibodies), organ weights, or 
macroscopic pathology. 
At terminal necropsy, microscopic lesions that were considered related to atezolizumab administration 
included minimal to mild arteritis/periarteritis in various tissues in 1 of 6 animals in the 50 mg/kg IV 
and 15 mg/kg SC dose groups, and in 2 of 6 animals in the 50 mg/kg SC dose group. Atezolizumab-
related arteritis/periarteritis were noted within the interstitium of parenchymal organs (heart, kidney, 
liver, pancreas, and epididymis), or within the submucosa or muscularis of tubular organs such as the 
gastrointestinal (GI) and female reproductive tracts at the terminal necropsy. These findings were not 
present at the recovery necropsy (Day 141), indicating either resolution during the recovery period or 
lack of occurrence in the recovery cohorts. 
Although arteritis/periarteritis has been reported to occur spontaneously in cynomolgus monkeys to 
the same extent as in the present study (generally subclinical in severity, similar in tissue distribution) 
(Beach et al. 1974; Chamanza et al. 2006), this finding was considered atezolizumab related as it 
occurred only in test article-treated groups; the incidence appeared to be dose related and exceeded 
the test facility’s historical control incidence, and is consistent with the primary pharmacology of 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibition and the deregulation of peripheral tolerance. 
Local tolerance was assessed by macroscopic and microscopic examination of the injection sites as part 
of the 8-week repeat-dose cynomolgus monkey toxicology study. At terminal necropsy, minimal, focal 
to multifocal, and often perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates were noted in the SC tissue at the 
injection sites for 3 of 6 and 6 of 6 animals in the 15 and 50 mg/kg atezolizumab SC dose groups, 
respectively; these findings were also considered related to atezolizumab administration. This 
injection-site change was not present at recovery necropsy, suggesting reversibility. The minimal 
injection-site findings are consistent with SC administration of heterologous protein and resolved 
during the recovery period; therefore, they were not considered adverse. 
Taken together, these data demonstrate that the nonclinical safety profile of atezolizumab is similar 
between IV and SC administration. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
No dedicated genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies has been performed with atezolizumab. This is 
acceptable based on the nature of the pharmaceutical being a monoclonal antibody.  
2.5.4.4.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive toxicity studies (developmental or fertility) have not been conducted and are not 
planned, as atezolizumab is expected to have an adverse effect on pregnancy. Current literature 
suggests a risk to the human fetus, including embryo lethality, and a warning of this risk would be 
warranted on the atezolizumab label upon registration regardless of the outcome of any additional 
nonclinical studies. 
The PD-L1/PD-1 signaling pathway is well established as essential in maternal/fetal tolerance and 
embryo-fetal survival during gestation. Inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway by administration of an 
anti-PD-L1 mAb increased fetal rejection rates in an allogeneic pregnancy model, and PD-L1 deficient 
females exhibited a decrease in allogeneic fetal survival when compared with heterozygotes and wild-

Page 19/114 
 
 
 
 
type littermate controls (Guleria et al. 2005; Habicht et al. 2007; D’Addio et al. 2011). Fetal rejection 
was determined to be T-cell- but not B-cell-dependent. An increased expansion/frequency of IFN-λ 
producing lymphocytes responding to paternal alloantigens was detected in peripheral lymphocytes, as 
well as the fetomaternal interface in pregnant PD-L1-deficient females and in pregnant wild-type mice 
following anti-PD-L1 administration. Fetal rejection did not occur in syngeneic pregnancy models, 
consistent with the critical role of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway in maintaining maternal tolerance to 
paternally derived allogeneic antigens. 
In the human placenta, PD-L1 is expressed by villous syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts, the 
fetal cells that are in close contact with the maternal blood and tissue (Petroff et al. 2003; Petroff et al. 
2005; Holets et al. 2006). PD-L1 expression is low in the first trimester but rises around the onset of 
the second trimester, coinciding with an increase in maternal blood flow to the placenta. Since the 
human fetus expresses several paternally derived alloantigens and is in close proximity to maternal 
leukocytes, atezolizumab administration is expected to inhibit maternal/fetal tolerance and negatively 
impact embryo-fetal survival. The weight of evidence suggests there is a risk to the human fetus, 
including embryo lethality. Based on the evidence provided above, Committee for Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (CHMP) agreed that additional embryofetal development studies are unlikely to provide 
additional safety insights and are not warranted (CHMP Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/214558/ 
2013). 
In the SmPC section 5.3. a paragraph on reproductive toxicity regarding rHuPh20 has been included. 
The paragraph is in line with the SmPC for Herceptin SC, which is co-administered with hyaluronidase 
(rHuPh20) and is acceptable.  
2.5.4.5.  Toxicokinetic data 
Table 1: Non-compartmental PK parameter Estimates (Mean +_ SD) following 9 weekly 
doses of Atezolizumab to Cynomolgus Monkeys (Study 08-1148) 
The repeat dose study had two SC administration dose groups, in which the dose level administered 
was comparable to the mid and high dose iv groups. The bioavailability following SC administration of 
atezolizumab at a dose of 15 or 50 mg/kg was 54.3 and 51.8 respectively. No nonclinical studies have 
been performed with atezolizumab and the absorption enhancer rHuPh20 – hence no nonclinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 20/114 
 
 
 
 
 
knowledge is available regarding the effect and how much the bioavailability of atezolizumab is 
increased in this particular combination. However, this is shown in clinical studies to be to 
approximately 70%, although variable. 
2.5.4.6.  Local tolerance 
In general, it is accepted that no additional studies are performed in support of atezolizumab SC 
formulation. Local tolerance endpoints were included in the study where atezolizumab was 
administered SC repeatedly for 8 weeks duration. Minimal, focal to multifocal, and often perivascular 
mononuclear cell infiltrates were noted in the SC tissue at the injection sites for 3 of 6 and 6 of 6 
animals in the 15 and 50 mg/kg atezolizumab SC dose groups – but reversibility was observed in the 
recovery period. 
The non-clinical and clinical safety of hyaluronidase in subcutaneous formulations of monoclonal 
antibodies (e.g. Herceptin) including Local Tolerance is demonstrated in other products. Hence, it is 
accepted that the safety of the co-administration of atezolizumab and hyaluronidase was confirmed in 
the clinical setting. 
2.5.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
No additional toxicity studies were performed.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Atezolizumab, the antineoplastic pharmaceutical active ingredient in Tecentriq, is an IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody. As an unaltered protein, being extensively degraded in the patient’s body by regular 
proteolytic mechanisms before excretion, Atezolizumab is unlikely to result in a significant 
environmental exposure. 
No specific ERA studies are required, in line with the current guideline.  
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, atezolizumab is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical safety of subcutaneous (SC) and IV administration of recombinant human 
hyaluronidase enzyme (rHuPH20) has been extensively characterized in mice and cynomolgus 
monkeys with no relevant toxicological findings in the general toxicity studies. 
The toxicology program was designed to support IV or SC administration of atezolizumab to patients. 
The toxicity and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab following SC administration were well characterized in a 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkey (Study 08-1148). 
Atezolizumab was given via either IV (5 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg) or SC administration (15 
mg/kg or 50 mg/kg) weekly for 8 weeks (9 total doses). The toxicity was assessed for the reversibility 
or persistence of any effects after a 12-week treatment-free recovery period. 
Scientific advice regarding the adequacy of the nonclinical studies performed to support SC formulation 
was given in November 2018, regarding the adequacy of the nonclinical studies performed to support 
the extension. It was concluded at that point in time, that no further animal studies were required.  
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023

Any increased exposure of atezolizumab due to hyaluronidase is covered by repeat-dose toxicity 
studies using the intravenous route of administration. 
The differences in formulations between the non-clinical SC study and the Phase 1 and III clinical 
studies are not considered detrimental for the validity of the SC study in monkeys. 
The non-clinical and clinical safety of hyaluronidase in subcutaneous formulations of monoclonal 
antibodies (e.g. Herceptin) is demonstrated in other products. Hence, it is accepted that the safety of 
the co-administration of atezolizumab and hyaluronidase was confirmed in the clinical setting. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies were performed in support of this line extension to include SC 
administration of atezolizumab. The in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and 
toxicology of TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) have been thoroughly investigated in nonclinical studies 
following intravenous (IV) administration 
The toxicity and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab following SC administration were well characterized in a 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkey (Study 08-1148). These 
data demonstrate that the nonclinical safety profile of atezolizumab is similar between IV and SC 
administration. It is acceptable, that the safety of hyaluronidase, which is a consolidated excipient in 
SC formulations of other approved monoclonal antibodies, is confirmed in the clinical studies in 
combination with atezolizumab. 
The application is approvable, from a nonclinical perspective. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) data to support atezolizumab 
pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity for the atezolizumab program across the clinical trials using the 
intravenous (IV) formulation has been described and assessed previously (EMEA/H/C/004143). This

 A  2-part  PK  bridging  study  (Study  BP40657,  hereinafter  IMscin001)  was  conducted  to  support  the 
approval of atezolizumab subcutaneous (SC) as shown in Table 2.

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The atezolizumab assays used for quantification and for ADA testing were the same as used in previous 
procedures. A bridging immunoassay with electrochemiluminescence detection using the Meso Scale 
Discovery platform was developed and validated to quantify rHuPH20 concentrations in human plasma. 
Validated bioanalytical methods for detection, confirmation, and titration of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in 
plasma were used to assess immunogenicity of rHuPH20.  
A population PK model was previously developed for atezolizumab using Phase I PK data (subsequently 
called the “IV popPK model”) from two clinical studies: Study PCD4989g and Study JO28944. The 
atezolizumab IV popPK model was a two-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination 
and have previously been applied for description of atezolizumab PK across different cancer types.

An initial atezolizumab SC popPK model from the Phase Ib (Part 1) portion of Study IMscin001 was 
used as a starting point for IMscin001 Phase III (Part 2) model development. The absorption model 
structure and population parameters for absorption were estimated based on Part 1 and Part 2 data 
while CL, Q, Vc, and Vp were fixed to the values of the IV popPK model. The final IV/SC model included 
effects of albumin on Ka and haemoglobin on F1.

Exposure-response models 
Exposure-response analyses were conducted based on data collected in Part 2 of IMscin001 and logistic 
regression models (for ORR and safety endpoints) or Kaplan Meier plots and Cox proportional hazard 
models (for PFS and OS). The patient characteristics of continuous and categorical variables in Cohort 
5 in which all subjects received 1875 mg SC in the thigh were used to generate exposure metrics by 
the final IV/SC popPK model.

The primary objective of Part 1 was to determine the dose of atezolizumab SC that yields comparable 
exposure to atezolizumab IV on the basis of Ctrough at Cycle 1 (predose Cycle 2). PopPK modeling was

The selected dosage of 1875 mg was determined based on the results of Part 1 of IMscin001. This 
study and its model-based evaluation determined 1875 mg Q3W SC would demonstrate exposure non-
inferior to 1200 mg Q3W IV.  
Model-based simulations using the Part 2 study design (i.e., 2:1 randomization, OAK demographics) 
demonstrated a high probability (>0.99) that atezolizumab SC 1800 mg Q3W in the thigh would result 
in non-inferior exposures of model-predicted Ctrough and AUC0-21 d at Cycle 1 compared to 
atezolizumab 1200 mg Q3W IV.  A lower dose of 1600 mg SC in the thigh may have provided 
insufficient AUC coverage to the 1200 mg Q3W IV dosing regimen (GM 2625 µg•day/mL vs 2990 
µg•day/mL for Cycle 1 AUC0-21 d).  In addition, the results suggested 1875 mg SC dose in the 
abdomen provided insufficient AUC exposure to the 1200 mg Q3W IV dosing regimen (GM 2322 
µg•day/mL vs 2990 µg•day/mL for Cycle 1 AUC0-21 d) (Table 9).

Based on Part 1 results and to allow more precise dosing, the 1875 mg (15 mL) Q3W SC in the thigh 
dosing regimen of atezolizumab was selected for Part 2 to achieve atezolizumab drug exposure 
(observed serum Ctrough and model-predicted AUC at Cycle 1 [AUC0-21 d]) non-inferior to the 
approved 1200 mg Q3W IV atezolizumab dosing regimen.

Based on non-compartmental (NCA) analysis, the serum atezolizumab concentrations following SC 
administration at single doses of 1200 mg (Cohort 2) and 1800 mg (Cohort 1 and 3) showed a dose-
dependent increase in exposure with similar median Tmax reached in 3-4 days (min-max: 3-9 days) in 
the thigh or abdomen in part 1 of IMscin001. A similar terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) and 
accumulation ratio were demonstrated in both treatment arms (SC or IV) with medians varying from 
20.0 to 22.3 days for t1/2 and 1.2 to 4.1 for accumulation ratio.

There was high inter-individual variability for SC bioavailability (124%) according to the PopPK 
analysis, based on a small sample size for the SC cohorts in Part 1 of IMscin001. Higher variability was 
observed following SC administration compared to historical IV. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Exposure-response 
The exploratory PK objective for Part 2 of IMscin001 was to evaluate potential relationships between 
atezolizumab exposure and efficacy and safety.  
Individual exposure metrics, Cycle 1 model-predicted Ctrough, Cmax, and AUC0-21d, were derived 
based on the individual EBE from the atezolizumab IV/SC popPK model for patients receiving 
atezolizumab SC and IV in Part 2 of IMscin001. 
Exposure-Efficacy Relationship  
The ORR proportion in this population was 11.8% (29 responders out of 246 patients).  Neither of the 
atezolizumab exposure metrics (Ctrough [Figure 11] and AUC0-21d [Figure 12] at Cycle 1) were 
significantly related to the probability of ORR.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The atezolizumab assays used for quantification and for ADA testing were the same as used in previous 
procedures. Validated bioanalytical methods for detection, confirmation, and titration of anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies in plasma were used to assess immunogenicity of rHuPH20.  
The data to support the application is based on the clinical data from IMscin001, a two-part, open-
label, multicentre Phase Ib/III randomized study to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and 
efficacy of atezolizumab SC compared with atezolizumab IV in patients with previously treated locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC who are cancer immunotherapy (CIT)-naive and for whom prior 
platinum therapy has failed.  
A previous IV model based on Phase 1 data were used as the base to fit the initial SC data. All 
disposition parameters were fixed and only absorption parameters were estimated. An initial SC model 
based on data from Part 1 of Study IMscin001 was used as a starting point for IMscin001 Part 2 model 
development. The SC model did not account for the exposure difference observed between sites of 
injection, abdomen or thigh. Different SC formulations were used between Part 1 and Part 2. VPCs of 
Study IMscin001 Part 2 Ctrough Cycle 1, Cohort 4 (IV) and Cohort 5 (SC) revealed bias in the model fit 
with the absorption phase following SC dosing not being captured and the IV data of Cycle 1 being 
underpredicted. A model update based solely on Cohort 4 and 5 Cycle 1 data improved the fit and 
resulted in comparable geometric mean ratios of model-predicted Cycle 1 AUC0-21d to the previous 
reported model. The non-inferiority testing of Tecentriq IV and SC for the model predicted end-point 
Cycle 1 AUC0-21d is therefore considered acceptable.  
The results from Part 1 based on observed PK data as well as popPK modelling and simulation (dose-
finding) provided the rationale for the dosing regimen selected for atezolizumab SC in Part 2.  
Regarding the different absorption process after SC administration, thigh as administration site 
resulted in on average ~30% higher exposures as did abdomen. SC administration produced dose-
dependent exposure increases over a dose range of 1200 mg to 1800 mg Q3W in the thigh. Following 
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 41/114 
 
 
 
 
 
a single dose of 1800 mg SC administered in the thigh (Cohort 1), the geometric mean of observed 
Ctrough at Cycle 1 (121 µg/mL) was 1.6-fold higher compared to that of the historical OAK IV PK data 
(74.9 µg/mL).  Tmax was 4.5 days, with a range of 2.2-9 days after SC administration. A similar 
terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) and accumulation ratio were demonstrated in both treatment arms 
(SC or IV) with medians varying from 20.0 to 22.3 days for t1/2 and 1.2 to 4.1 for accumulation ratio. 
Inter-individual variability was high and higher in SC than IV.  
In the two-compartmental disposition popPK model with first-order absorption (SC only) and 
elimination describing atezolizumab PK following SC or IV administration six significant covariates were 
found to influence atezolizumab PK parameters: albumin on apparent first-order absorption rate 
constant (KA) and clearance (CL), haemoglobin on F, body weight on CL, Vc and Vp, tumor burden on 
CL, ADA status on CL, and sex on Vc and Vp accounting for <30% change from typical value. The 
existing wording in section 5.2 of the SmPC regarding special populations does not need to be updated. 
The model-predicted exposure metrics were in general consistent with observed PK findings. 
When covariate effects based on body weight, sex, age, race, ethnicity, renal impairment, and hepatic 
impairment on atezolizumab exposure were numerically compared, exposure metrics were lower in 
patients with higher body weight or in female patients compared to male which is consistent with the 
known atezolizumab PK. A minor trend was observed with ethnicity, Hispanics having marginally higher 
exposure metrics (22% higher GM model-predicted AUC0-21d) than non-Hispanics, their 90% 
confidence intervals still largely overlapping.  
In light of the high variability it is overall acceptable that these changes do not translate into dose 
modifications. As the study is conducted in patients with previously treated locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC, which could count as a part of the target population, but do not represent it (the 
target population) as a whole and these are a subset of often very severely ill patients in a bad 
(nutritional) condition, the MAH has justified the representativeness to other populations with e.g. a 
higher albumin status.  
The main objective of Part 2 (Phase III, randomized, dose confirmation) was to demonstrate the non-
inferiority of Cycle 1 drug exposure (with respect to atezolizumab trough concentration [Ctrough] and 
model-predicted area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 21 days [AUC0–21 d]) following 
treatment with Atezo SC at the 1875 mg Q3W dosing regimen compared with drug exposure following 
treatment with Atezo IV at the approved 1200 mg Q3W dosing regimen. 
The non-inferiority testing of co-primary endpoints (observed Ctrough and model-predicted AUC0-21 d 
at Cycle 1) was met. The GMR of serum atezolizumab Ctrough, SC/Ctrough,IV values at Cycle 1 was 
1.05 (90% CI: 0.88, 1.24). The GMR of model predicted serum atezolizumab AUC0-21 d,SC/AUC0-21 
d,IV values at Cycle 1 was 0.87 (90% CI: 0.83, 0.92).  The corresponding lower limit of the two-sided 
90% CI for both co-primary endpoints were above the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.8. 
Nevertheless, even if the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.8 for the PK endpoints is met, the 
model-predicted exposure in the SC arm was 13% lower than for the IV arm and the CI limits were 
narrow around the point estimate and did not include 1.0, i.e. the difference was statistically 
significant. The secondary endpoints of model-predicted exposure metrics at steady state (Ctrough,SS 
and AUCSS) and Ctrough, Cycle 1 were shown to be similar between the SC and IV arms.  It is not 
required that unity should be included. When the new model was used to predict Cycle 1 AUC0-21d for 
non-inferiority testing of the SC versus IV doses in IMScin001, it resulted in a GMR of 0.86 and a 90% 
CI of 0.81 to 0.91. This result is comparable to the initial result obtained with the previous model, 
however, the updated Pop PK model shows that a better description of e.g. the absorption phase does 
not influence the non-inferiority test outcome. Therefore, the conclusion that the test of non-inferiority 
is also met for the model predicted serum atezolizumab AUC0-21d co primary endpoint. This was 
confirmed after updating the Pop PK model to be considered appropriate for the description of subjects

receiving SC doses and repeat non-inferiority tests using model exposures also including observed 
Ctrough (cycle 1).   
No statistically significant exposure-efficacy relationships were identified with ORR, PFS, or OS in 
patients treated with SC atezolizumab 1875 mg Q3W. However, noting that the claim is to extrapolate 
all the indications of the IV formulation to its subcutaneous counterparts, a thorough discussion on 
exposure-response (E-R) for each of the approved indications was provided, justifying that the 
differences seen in exposure, including the variability in Ctrough, are compatible with retained efficacy 
for each indication. This was done as the results from the dose-ranging IV clinical study showed that 
no statistically significant relationship was associated with efficacy and atezolizumab exposures ranging 
from 0.597 µg/mL to 242.6 µg/mL for MP Ctrough at Cycle 1 and all patients in the SC arm of 
IMscin001 Part 2 had drug exposures within this range. Additionally, all patients in the SC arm of 
IMscin001 Part 2 at the lowest end of exposure had MP Ctrough at Cycle 1 (20 µg/mL minimum) as 
high as that in each of the combination IV studies at the lowest end (5.88 to 34.9 µg/mL minimum). 
All SC patients had drug exposure within the full E-R range for atezolizumab IV and > 99% of SC 
patients had drug concentrations above the receptor saturation threshold of 6 µg/mL. Further similar 
dose exposure response relationship was observed in all of the IV indications. It is thus accepted that 
patients treated with SC, including patients with drug exposure at the extreme lower end, achieve 
adequate drug exposures despite the higher variability. 
No statistically significant exposure-safety relationships were identified with serious adverse events 
(SAE), adverse events of special interest (AESI), adverse events (AE) of Grade 3-5, or injection site 
reactions (ISR) in patients treated with SC atezolizumab 1875 mg Q3W. 
In Part 2 of IMscin001, the treatment-emergent atezolizumab ADA incidence was comparable between 
arms (19.5% in the Atezo SC arm and 13.9% in the Atezo IV arm). The atezolizumab ADA incidence 
for both arms were within the range of ADA incidence observed across multiple Phase II and III studies 
with atezolizumab administered by IV (13.1% to 54.1%). There did not appear to be a clinically 
relevant impact of ADAs on PK, efficacy, or safety in both treatment arms. However, development of 
ADAs appears to be more frequent in the SC than the IV arm. This could be a concern, since presence 
of ADAs may decrease atezolizumab PK exposure which could, in turn, result in sub-optimal efficacy. 
As ADAs were more frequent in the SC arm, this could affect the benefit-risk in patients treated with 
SC atezolizumab.  The limited number of ADA + patients in the IV arm (n = 15) however restrain the 
interpretability of the findings. Since there was an overlapping distribution in exposure between ADA 
subgroups in the SC study, 99% of both ADA positive and negative had Cmin concentrations above the 
target serum concentration of 6 μg/mL and the exposure-response relationship is flat, is seems 
acceptable to conclude that the benefit-risk is not impacted negatively. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The non-inferiority testing of Tecentriq 1200 mg IV Q3W and 1875 mg SC Q3W was met for both co-
primary endpoints: observed Ctrough at Cycle 1, and model-predicted AUC0-21d at Cycle 1.  
Moreover, it was sufficiently justified that all patients in the SC arm had drug exposure within the full 
E-R range for atezolizumab IV and   99% of SC patients had drug concentrations above the receptor 
saturation threshold of 6 g/mL. Further similar dose exposure response relationship was observed in 
all of the IV indications. It is thus considered that patients treated with atezolizumab SC, including 
patients with drug exposure at the extreme lower end, achieve adequate drug exposures despite the 
higher variability.

Methods 
Study Participants 
The study population consisted of immunotherapy-naïve patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC for 
whom prior platinum-based therapy had failed. 
Key inclusion criteria 
•  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesions were only 
considered as measurable disease if disease progression had been unequivocally documented 
at that site since radiation, and the previously irradiated lesion was not the only site of disease. 
•  Histologically or cytologically documented NSCLC that is currently locally advanced or 
metastatic (i.e., Stage IIIB not eligible for definitive chemoradiotherapy, Stage IV, or 
recurrent) NSCLC (per the Union Internationale contre le Cancer/American Joint Committee on 
Cancer staging system, 8th edition). 
•  Disease progression during or following treatment with a platinum-containing regimen for 
locally advanced, unresectable/inoperable or metastatic NSCLC or disease recurrence within 6 
months of treatment with a platinum-based adjuvant/neoadjuvant regimen or combined 
modality (e.g., chemoradiation) regimen with curative intent. 
Patients may have received one additional cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen provided 
no interval disease progression has occurred. Chemotherapy regimens will be counted 
based on interval disease progression and not the number of agents or switches in 
agents (e.g., a first-line therapy that consists of several cycles of a platinum doublet 
and subsequent maintenance therapy that introduces or switches to a new 
chemotherapy agent without interval disease progression will all be considered one 
chemotherapy regimen). 
Adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation was considered a prior 
chemotherapy regimen if <6 months had elapsed between the last dose and the date 
of recurrence. 
Patients with advanced lung cancer and a sensitizing EGFR mutation were additionally 
required to have experienced disease progression (during or after treatment) or 
intolerance with one or more EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors appropriate for the 
treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. 
• 
Patients were required to have recovered (i.e., improvement to Grade 1 or better) from all 
acute toxicities from previous therapy, excluding alopecia. For peripheral neuropathy, 
improvement to Grade ≤2 was considered acceptable. 
• 
• 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.  
Life expectancy ≥12 weeks. 
•  Adequate hematologic and end-organ function, defined by the following laboratory test results, 
obtained within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment: 
– Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x µ109/L (1500/µL) without granulocyte colony- 
stimulating factor support. 
– Lymphocyte count ≥0.5 x 109/L (500/µL). 
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 45/114 
 
 
 
 
– Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L (100,000/µL) (without transfusion). 
– Haemoglobin ≥90 g/L (9 g/dL); patients could be transfused to meet this criterion. 
– AST, ALT, and ALP ≤2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), with the following exceptions: 
o Patients with documented liver metastases: AST and ALT ≤5 x ULN. 
o Patients with documented liver or bone metastases: ALP ≤5 x ULN. 
– Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN with the following exception: 
o Patients with known Gilbert disease: total bilirubin level ≤3 x ULN. 
– Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN. 
– Serum albumin ≥25 g/L (2.5 g/dL). 
– For patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: INR or a PTT ≤1.5 x ULN. 
Inclusion Criteria specific to Part 1 patients 
•  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2 (inclusive). 
Inclusion Criteria specific to Part 2 patients 
• 
Patients whose tumour may harbour a sensitizing EGFR mutation must have known EGFR test 
results at the time of randomisation. However, patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations were 
to be excluded once 10% of the total sample size was reached. Of note, the 10% limit was not 
reached so no such patients were excluded. 
•  Availability of a pre-study treatment representative formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) 
tumour specimen in paraffin block (preferred) or at least six slides containing unstained, 
freshly cut, serial sections from an FFPE tumour specimen for exploratory biomarker analysis. 
Key Exclusion Criteria 
•  Symptomatic, untreated, or actively progressing CNS metastases; asymptomatic CNS lesions 
were permitted provided the following criteria were met: 
– Measurable disease, per RECIST v1.1, should have been present outside the CNS. 
– No history of intracranial haemorrhage or spinal cord haemorrhage. 
– The patient had not undergone stereotactic radiotherapy within 7 days prior to initiation of 
study treatment, whole-brain radiotherapy within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment, 
or neurosurgical resection within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment. 
– The patient had no ongoing requirement for corticosteroids as therapy for CNS disease. Anti-
convulsant therapy at a stable dose was permitted. 
– Metastases were limited to the cerebellum or the supratentorial region (i.e., no metastases 
to the midbrain, pons, medulla, or spinal cord). 
– No evidence of interim progression between completion of CNS-directed therapy and 
initiation of study treatment. 
Patients with new asymptomatic CNS metastases detected at the screening scan were required 
to receive radiation therapy and/or surgery for CNS metastases. Following treatment, these 
patients could then be eligible without the need for an additional brain scan prior to enrolment, 
if all other criteria were met.

Sample size 
Initially, it is expected that up to 20% of randomized patients will need to be excluded from the Per 
Protocol PK population. a total of approximately 327 patients were planned to be randomized. Later on 
as per protocol, to account for the increase in PK-unevaluable dropout rate (20% initially assumed vs. 
23.9% observed (including missing samples)) in the blinded review of the JMC meeting, the minimum 
sample size needed for this study was increased to 355 patients. This was discussed in the JMC 
meeting on 09 February 2022 and the JMC approved to increase the sample size. The re-estimated 
sample size provides sufficient power for the statistical hypothesis testing for the co-primary endpoints 
(observed Ctrough and model-predicted AUC0-21 d at Cycle 1) based on the assumptions of the 
BP40657 SAP (v3). Under these assumptions, a sample size of ≥261 pharmacokinetic (PK)-evaluable 
patients in the atezolizumab SC and atezolizumab IV arms would provide at least 80% power to 
conclude non-inferiority of atezolizumab SC compared to atezolizumab IV based on Cycle 1 
Ctrough,and AUC0–21 d with a non-inferiority margin of 0.8 for the GMR, or more concisely: Ctrough, 
SC >0.8 Ctrough, IV and AUC0–21 d, SC >0.8 AUC0-21 d, IV. . 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Patients in Part 2 were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: atezolizumab 1875 mg SC 
Q3W (21 days) or atezolizumab 1200 mg IV Q3W. Randomisation occurred in a 2:1 ratio using a 
permuted-block randomisation method to ensure a balanced assignment to each treatment arm. 
Given the open-label nature of this study, the study management team (SMT) was unblinded to study 
treatments. However, to further protect the integrity of the study, any treatment assignment 
information, such as randomisation files from the interactive voice/web response system (IxRS) and PK 
data, was withheld from the Sponsor until the primary analysis. Data for safety purposes were not 
reviewed at an aggregate level prior to the primary analysis by the SMT. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets Part 1 
PK analyses was performed on data from PK evaluable patients, i.e. at least one dose and at least one 
post-dose PK sample, enrolled in part 1. Safety analysis was performed on all subjects with at least 
one dose. 
Analysis sets Part 2 
The primary analysis was conducted on the PK analysis population, including all patients without 
protocol deviations that could affect PK. Efficacy analyses on OS and PFS were done for the full 
analysis set, FAS, consisting of all patients randomised and by assigned treatment. Analyses on OR 
and DoR were done on the subpopulation of FAS with measurable disease at baseline. Safety analysis 
was done on the full analysis set by actual treatment. 
CO-PRIMARY ENDPOINTS ANALYSIS  
The primary comparisons of interest are the geometric mean ratios (GMR) and confidence intervals of 
PK parameters for atezolizumab SC versus atezolizumab IV.  The PK objective for Part 2 is to 
demonstrate non-inferiority of exposure to atezolizumab SC compared with atezolizumab IV based on 
the following co-primary endpoints:  
•  Observed serum Ctrough at Cycle 1 (predose Cycle 2) 
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 52/114 
 
 
 
 
•  Model-predicted area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 21 days (AUC0–21 d) at 
Cycle 1 
MULTIPLICITY ADJUSTMENT 
Cycle 1 observed serum Ctrough (predose Cycle 2) and model-predicted AUC0–21 d were tested using 
the Hochberg procedure (Hochberg and Tamhane 1987; FDA 2017). In step 1 of this procedure, if the 
lower bounds of the 90% CI for both the GMR Ctrough,SC/Ctrough,IV and the GMR AUC0–21 d, 
SC/AUC0–21 d, IV are ≥ 0.8, both null hypotheses is rejected. In this case, it is concluded that SC 
administration is non-inferior to IV administration in terms of Ctrough and AUC in Cycle 1. 
If in Step 1 the null hypotheses are not rejected, the procedure continues to Step 2. In Step 2, if the 
95% CI for one GMR (i.e., either Ctrough,SC/Ctrough,IV or AUC0– 21 d, SC/AUC0−21 d, IV) is ≥ 0.8, 
the corresponding null hypothesis is rejected. In this case, it is concluded that SC administration is 
non-inferior to IV administration in terms of Ctrough or AUC in Cycle 1. 
Definition of Co-Primary Endpoints  
Following the estimand framework introduced in the ICH-E9 addendum (ICH 2020), the estimand for 
the primary analysis follows a principal stratum strategy based on the following attributes: 
Co-Primary Estimand 1:  
o  Population:  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who are CITnaive and for 
whom prior platinum therapy has failed.  The analysis population will consist of the Per Protocol 
PK population, with patients grouped according to their received treatment.  
o  Variable:  The Cycle 1 observed serum Ctrough (predose Cycle 2), using the measured 
concentration from the PK sample.  
o  Treatment:  Atezolizumab IV versus atezolizumab SC, at the determined dose at baseline.  
All randomized patients are expected to receive the baseline infusion or injection.   
o 
Intercurrent Events and Handling Strategy:  
▪  Premature discontinuation from treatment:  Every effort will be made to ensure all 
randomized patients will receive the treatment at baseline and will have the PK sample 
collected appropriately.  Treatment will start within 5 days of randomization.  Withdrawal 
after randomization, prior to baseline treatment is not expected.  In case of such an event, 
those patients are excluded from the analysis population and those patients will not be 
replaced.  
▪  Premature discontinuation from study:  Some patients could discontinue the study 
prior to the time point of predose Cycle 2 due to death or other reasons.  Considering the 
short interval between randomization and Cycle 2, this situation is expected to be 
exceptional.  Those patients are excluded from the population.  
▪  Missing or outside of window PK samples:  Some patients could have a Cycle 1 Ctrough 
PK sample missing or outside of the accepted window, due to early withdrawal or other 
reasons.  Every effort will be made to collect PK samples on schedule.  Those patients are 
excluded from the analysis population.   
o  Summary measure:  Geometric mean ratio (GMR) and 90% CI of atezolizumab SC versus 
atezolizumab IV of Cycle 1 Ctrough.  The non-inferiority would be established if the lower bound 
of the 90% CI is ≥ 0.8.  
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 53/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-Primary Estimand 2:  
o  Population:  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who are CITnaive and for 
whom prior platinum therapy has failed.  The analysis population will consist of the PK 
Evaluable population, with patients grouped according to their received treatments.   
o  Variable:  Model-predicted Cycle 1 AUC0–21 d derived from the popPK model.  
o    Treatment:  same as for co-primary endpoint Cycle 1 observed serum Ctrough  
   o      Intercurrent Events and Handling Strategy:  
▪ 
Absence of post-treatment PK blood sample:  Some patients could discontinue the 
study following their Cycle 1 dose prior to providing a post- baseline PK blood sample or 
PK blood samples could not be collected.  Considering the short interval between the first 
study drug treatment (Cycle 1) and the first PK blood sample (8+/- 2 hours) as well as 
the numerous PK blood samples collected on study, these situations are expected to be 
exceptional.  Those patients are excluded from the analysis population.  
▪  Premature discontinuation from treatment:  Every effort will be made to ensure all 
randomized patients will receive the study drug treatment and corresponding PK sample 
collected.  Treatment will start within 5 days of randomization.  Withdrawal after 
randomization, prior to baseline treatment is not expected.  In case of such an event, 
those patients are excluded from the analysis population and those patients will not be 
replaced  
▪  Missing or inaccurate time and date reported for treatment administration or PK 
blood samples:  Every effort will be made to ensure all randomized patients will receive 
the treatment and will have the time and date of dosing and PK blood samples reported 
accurately.  Missing or inaccurate dosing time and date can occur during any cycle 
however, it is very rare.  In case of such an event, only such affected samples are 
excluded, and patients are retained as long as they have a single reportable dose and 
corresponding PK sample, regardless of the cycle.  
o  Summary measure:  GMR and 90% CI of atezolizumab SC versus atezolizumab IV of Cycle 
1 model predicted AUC0-21d.  The non-inferiority would be established if the lower bound of 
the 90% CI is ≥ 0.8.  
Main Analytical Approach for Co-Primary Endpoints  
The primary analysis of Ctrough is based on logarithmic values of observed Ctrough in Cycle 1 to 
compensate the known skewness of its distribution.  For natural logarithm (Ln) trough plasma 
concentration (Ctrough), the statistical hypothesis will be tested using an analysis of covariance model: 
Ln(Ctrough)ij =  + i + ij     (i=SC, IV; j=1, 2, …, ni)  
where µ denotes the overall mean, τi the effect of atezolizumab route of administration i (SC or IV), ni 
the number of patients in arm i (SC or IV), and εij a random error variable assumed to be independently 
and identically normally distributed with mean zero and variance 
2.  
The contrast SC – IV, its 90% confidence limits, and the variance 2 will be estimated from the model.  
An estimate of the treatment effects ratio and the corresponding 90% confidence limits for the 
untransformed variables will be calculated by exponentiation of the estimate of contrast SC – IV and 
the 90% confidence limits.  The CV for the untransformed primary variable will be estimated using the 
relationship CV = sqrt(exp(
2)-1).

If the lower confidence interval bound of exp(Ln[Ctrough,SC]-Ln[Ctrough,IV])=Ctrough,SC/Ctrough,IV is equal or 
greater than 0.8, then the null hypothesis can be rejected.   
The model-predicted Cycle 1 AUC0–21  d  is a co-primary  endpoint and  will be analyzed using  the  same 
method as for the other co-primary endpoint, Cycle 1 observed serum Ctrough.  
The co-primary endpoints will be statistically tested at the same α-level (one-sided significance level of 
0.05) using the Hochberg procedure. 
Supplementary Analysis for Co-Primary Endpoints  
A supplementary sensitivity analysis may be conducted on Cycle 1 Ctrough values derived from the 
popPK model.  The aim of using predicted Ctrough is to take into account possible deviations from the 
protocol (i.e., sampling schedule or dosing interval) and to reduce noise (i.e., precision of analytical 
measurement).  
The Cycle 1 Ctrough values derived from the popPK model is a different estimand with respect to the 
observed serum Ctrough.  The attributes such as treatment and summary measure have the same 
definition as the primary endpoint (Ctrough), while the population and intercurrent events will be defined 
and handled using the same approach and strategies specified for the model-predicted Cycle 1 AUC.    
PK Analyses  
For secondary PK and popPK analyses, the PK evaluable population will be used.   
Model- predicted Ctrough at Cycle 1 (Ctrough Cycle 1), model-predicted Ctrough at steady state (Ctrough,ss), 
and model-predicted AUC at steady state (AUCss) will be descriptively compared between atezolizumab 
SC and IV.  
The PK data will be analyzed using statistical summary measures, listings, and graphs as appropriate, 
documented in more detail in a Clinical Pharmacology Analysis Plan (2022), and also reported in a 
standalone PK report.   
Efficacy Analyses  
The Response-evaluable population will be used for key secondary endpoint analysis of objective 
response rate (ORR) whilst a subset who achieved objective response, will be used for duration of 
response (DOR).  The Full Analysis Set will be used for key secondary endpoint analyses such as 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  The analysis mentioned below will be 
performed at the time of primary analysis and at the end of the study.  However, efficacy endpoints at 
the time of primary analysis given the nature of the trial and extremely small follow-up time will be 
immature.  Therefore, for the primary analysis, secondary endpoints will be descriptively compared 
between atezolizumab SC and IV, followed by more formal analysis in the final report, which will 
include more follow-up time.  
Objective Response Rate  
The analysis population for ORR will be the Response-evaluable population.  Patients not meeting the 
criteria for ORR, including patients without any post baseline tumor assessment, will be considered 
non-responders.  
Following the estimand framework (ICH 2020), the attributes of the estimand for the secondary 
endpoint are defined as follows:  
•  Population:  All randomized patients with measurable disease at baseline included in the 
Response-evaluable population.   
•  Variable:  ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with a CR or PR, as determined by the 
investigator according to RECIST v1.1.   
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 55/114 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Treatment:  As defined for the primary estimand   
•  Intercurrent events and Handling Strategy:  
Use of any non-protocol anti-cancer treatment (NPT) prior to disease progression as 
o 
detailed in Protocol Section 4.4.3.   
o 
Discontinuation of study treatment prior to disease progression  
ICE Handling Strategy:  Following treatment policy, all the ICE’s will be ignored, 
o 
and tumor assessment data collected after the ICE will be included in the ORR analysis.  
•  Population-level summary:  Difference in proportion.  
The ORR and 95% confidence intervals according to Clopper-Pearson will be calculated and presented 
by treatment arm.  For the difference in response rates, 95% two-sided confidence intervals (Hauck-
Anderson) will be calculated.  The above analysis will be repeated as apart of sensitivity analysis for 
confirmed ORR (CR or PR on two consecutive occasions ≥ 28 days apart, as determined by the 
investigator according to RECIST v1.1.)  
Progression-Free Survival  
Following the estimand framework (ICH 2020), the attributes of the estimand for the secondary 
endpoint are defined as follows:  
•  Population:  All randomized patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who are CIT-
naive and for whom prior platinum therapy has failed.    
•  Variable:  PFS, defined as the time from the date of study entry to the date of documented 
disease progression, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death from 
any cause, whichever is earlier. 
•  Treatment:  As defined for the primary estimand.   
• 
Intercurrent events and Handling Strategy:  
o  Use of any non-protocol anti-cancer treatment (NPT) prior to disease progression as 
detailed in Protocol Section 4.4.3.   
o  Discontinuation of study treatment prior to disease progression    
o  ICE Handling Strategy:  Following treatment policy, all the ICE’s will be ignored, and 
observations collected after the ICE will be included in the PFS analysis.  
•  Population-level summary:  Median duration and corresponding 95% CI.  
If participants have any intercurrent event(s), then the strategies defined above to handle the 
intercurrent events will be implemented.  Otherwise, data for participants without the occurrence of 
disease progression or death as of the clinical cutoff date (CCOD) will be censored at the time of the 
last tumor assessment prior to the CCOD (or at the time of randomization plus 1 day if no tumor 
assessment was performed after the baseline visit).  PFS will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier 
methodology, including survival plots, median duration and corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
according to the  
Brookmeyer- Crowley method (Brookmeyer and Crowley, Biometrics 1982).  The proportion of patients 
who are PFS event-free at 6 and 12 months after study entry will be estimated at the final analysis of 
the study when sufficient follow-up data are available.  The corresponding 95% CI will be calculated 
using the standard error derived from Greenwood’s formula.  The hazard ratio (HR), and 95% CI for 
descriptive comparison will be estimated using a Cox regression model.  
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 56/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the time of final analysis, additional sensitivity analyses of PFS may be conducted as appropriate in 
order to investigate the effect of baseline characteristics imbalances (if any) on the result.   
Overall Survival  
Following the estimand framework (ICH 2020), the attributes of the estimand for the secondary 
endpoint are defined as follows:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Population:  All randomized patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who are CIT-
naive and for whom prior platinum therapy has failed.    
Variable:  OS, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause  
Treatment:  As defined for the primary estimand    
Intercurrent events and Handling Strategy:  
o  Use of any non-protocol anti-cancer treatment (NPT) prior to disease progression as detailed 
in Protocol Section 4.4.3.   
o  Discontinuation of study treatment prior to disease progression  
o  ICE Handling Strategy:  Following treatment policy, all the ICE’s will be ignored, and 
observations collected after the ICE will be included in the OS analysis.  
Population-level summary:  Median duration and corresponding 95% CI.  
If participants have any intercurrent events, then the strategies defined above to handle the 
intercurrent events will be implemented.  Otherwise, data for patients who are alive at the time of the 
analysis data cutoff will be censored at the last date they were known to be alive.  Data from patients 
without postbaseline information will be censored at the date of randomization plus 1 day.  OS will be 
analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methodology, including survival plots, median duration and corresponding 
95% confidence intervals according to the Brookmeyer- Crowley method  
(Brookmeyer and Crowley, Biometrics 1982).  The proportion of patients alive at one and two years 
after study entry will be estimated at the final analysis of the study when sufficient follow-up data are 
available.  The corresponding 95% CI will be calculated using the standard error derived from 
Greenwood’s formula.  The hazard ratio (HR), and 95% CI for descriptive comparison will be estimated 
using a Cox regression model.  
At the time of final analysis, additional sensitivity analyses of OS may be conducted as appropriate 
in order to investigate the effect of baseline characteristics imbalances (if any) on the result.   
Duration of Response   
Analysis of DOR will include only patients who had an objective response.  Patients who have not 
progressed and who have not died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor 
assessment date.  If no tumor assessments were performed after the date of the first occurrence of a 
complete or partial response, DOR will be censored at the date of the first occurrence of a complete or 
partial response plus 1 day.    
Following the estimand framework (ICH 2020), the attributes of the estimand for the secondary 
endpoint are defined as follows:  
•  Population:  All patients with a measurable disease at baseline and a post-baseline objective 
response.  
•  Variable:  DOR, defined as the time interval from the date of the first occurrence of a complete or 
partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that progressive disease or 
death is documented, whichever occurs first.    
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 57/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Treatment:  As defined for the primary estimand   
• 
Intercurrent events and Handling Strategy:  
o  Use of any non-protocol anti-cancer treatment (NPT) prior to disease progression as detailed 
in Protocol Section 4.4.3.   
o  Discontinuation of study treatment prior to disease progression   
o  ICE Handling Strategy:  Following treatment policy, all the ICE’s will be ignored and 
observations collected after the ICE will be included in the DOR analysis.  
•  Population-level summary:  Median duration and corresponding 95% CI.  
DOR is based on a non-randomized subset of patients (specifically, patients who achieved an objective 
response); therefore, formal hypothesis testing will not be performed for this endpoint.  Comparisons 
between treatment arms will be made for descriptive purposes.  The methodologies detailed for the 
PFS analysis will be used for the DOR analysis.  The HR and 95% CI for descriptive comparison will be 
estimated using a Cox regression model.  
The above analysis will be repeated for confirmed objective response as defined above.  
Patient Reported Outcomes  
An additional secondary objective for Part 2 is to evaluate patient experience with atezolizumab SC 
compared with atezolizumab IV, based on the following endpoints:  
• 
Functioning and global health status over time, as assessed by the physical functioning, role 
functioning, and global health status/quality of life scales of the EORTC interleukin 57 (IL57)  
•  Overall satisfaction with treatment, as assessed by the modified satisfaction with therapy (SWT) 
scale of the Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ)  
Descriptive analyses, including summary statistics, will be performed, and presented by treatment arm 
for each patient-reported experience measure (item- and scale-level, as appropriate).  Item-level 
analyses will include frequencies and proportions and change from baseline at each visit by treatment 
arm.  Summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, minimum, maximum, interquartile range) of scale 
scores and score changes from baseline at each visit will be evaluated by treatment arm.  
For each of the EORTC scales, a prorated scale score will be calculated if 50% or more of the 
constituent items in the scale are completed.  The scale score will be considered missing if 
 50% of 
the constituent items were not completed.  A SWT scale score will be calculated if five or more items 
have been completed (out of seven).  The scale score will be considered missing if fewer than five 
items have been completed.  
PRO completion, compliance rates, and reasons for missing data will be summarized at each time point 
by treatment arm for each measure in full analysis set.  The compliance rate will be based on the total 
number of patients expected to complete the questionnaire at a particular time point.

Results 
•  Participant flow 
Figure 16 : Patient Disposition-Part 2 (All Patients) 
•  Recruitment 
First patient randomized and enrolled in part 2 took place on 2-DEC-2020. Last patient was enrolled on 
30-MARCH-2022. The initial CCOD was 26-APR-2022 and updated data with an additional 9 months of 
follow up has been provided with the DCO of 16 January 2023 
Part 2 of this study was conducted at 68 centres in 19 countries (number of centres, number of 
patients at time of CCOD): 
Thailand (8; 69), Russian Federation (8; 44), Turkey (5; 54), Brazil (5; 22), China (5; 10), Ukraine (4; 
28), Peru (4; 18), Guatemala (4; 7), Chile (3; 32), New Zealand (3; 13), Argentina (3; 7), South 
Africa (3; 3), Spain (2; 20), Greece (2; 9), Costa Rica (2; 8), Mexico (2; 8), Hungary (2; 7), Poland 
(2; 6), and Latvia (1; 6). Of note, 3 of the 6 patients from Poland were initially enrolled in Ukraine but 
were moved to Poland at the time of the clinical data cut-off. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Key protocol amendments 
The first version of the protocol is dated 5-AUG-2018. There were 5 amendments and version 6 is 
dated 25-FEB-2022. Version 2 affects only part 1 of the protocol. The main changes to the protocol and 
their rationale are summarised below: 
• 
The term "immune-related" has been changed to "immune-mediated" when describing events 
associated with atezolizumab (Section 5.1.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 59/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The procedures for reporting infusion-related reactions and injection-related reactions (IRRs) 
have been modified to include reporting of cytokine-release syndrome (CRS), as there may be 
significant overlap in signs and symptoms of IRRs and CRS (Sections 5.1.1). 
• 
For patients who do not initially meet all eligibility criteria for participation in this study, an 
additional re-screening opportunity has been added (for a total of three screenings per patient) at the 
investigator’s discretion, provided all initial and subsequent screening assessments are performed 
within 56 days prior to Day 1 (Section 3.1.1). 
• 
Immunosuppressive medications have been removed from the prohibited therapy section and 
added to the cautionary therapy section to align with management guidelines that permit use of 
immunosuppressive medications for the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated 
adverse events (Sections 4.4.2.1 and 4.4.3). 
• 
Lists of identified risks for atezolizumab have been revised to include severe cutaneous adverse 
reactions (Section 5.1.1). 
• 
Appendix 8 has been revised to indicate that caution should be used when considering 
atezolizumab for patients who have previously experienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse 
reaction while receiving another immunostimulatory anti-cancer agent. 
• 
Guidelines for management of atezolizumab-associated dermatologic adverse events have 
been revised to provide guidance on severe cutaneous adverse reactions of Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
and toxic epidermal necrolysis (Appendix 10). 
• 
Benefit-risk assessment and guidance on concomitant administration of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines with atezolizumab has been added (Sections 1.5, 4.4.1, 
5.1, and Appendix 10). 
Key SAP amendments 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) was developed based on Roche model document Version 2, 20-OCT- 
2020 for Study BP40657 (IMscin001) and has been amended to incorporate the following changes: 
• 
• 
The name of Population PK analysis set has been changed to PK evaluable set. 
Minor updates have been made to the definition of Per Protocol PK population and PK 
evaluable population to improve clarity. 
• 
Confirmed duration of response evaluable population has been added to the analysis 
set in Section 4. 
 VERSION 1, 10-NOV-2021: 
• 
The approximate number of patients expected to be enrolled in Part 2 of the study has 
been increased to 327 to accommodate the new co-primary PK endpoint (Cycle 1 AUC 0–21 
d). It has also been clarified that the total number of patients to be enrolled in Part 2 may be 
increased or decreased after taking into account the actually observed PK variability during 
the blinded sample-size re-estimation (Sections 3.1.1.2, 4.1, 6.3.2, 6.8.1, 6.14, and 9.5). 
VERSION 2, 25-MARCH-2022: 
• 
Estimand language in Section 6.6.2 has been corrected to match the definition of Per 
Protocol PK analysis population provided in Section 6.2.2. In the same section, the lower 
bound of the interval has been corrected to ≥0.8 instead of >0.8.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The claim of non-inferior efficacy of SC atezolizumab vs IV atezolizumab for all approved indications of 
atezolizumab IV is solely based on the pivotal IMscin001 studyfc. This was a randomised, open-label, 
multicentre, Phase III study in immunotherapy-naïve patients with advanced NSCLC in the second-line 
or beyond (2L+) setting. The patients were enrolled in countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, Europe, 
Central- and South America, Oceania and Africa. A total of 371 patients were randomised 2:1 to either 
atezolizumab monotherapy SC (n=247) or atezolizumab monotherapy IV (N=124). The median 
survival follow-up was 4.7 months in the overall population at DCO. 
The overall 2-part design of the single pivotal study, the IMscin001 trial –the targeted population, 
open-label design, 2:1 randomisation, definition of primary and secondary objectives/endpoints and 
choice of control arm– were extensively discussed in Scientific Advice meetings between 2018 and 
2020. Originally, the MAH had considered evaluating patients in the first-line setting, but changed to 
the 2L+ setting in the subsequent advice, adducing that atezolizumab monotherapy (in the 2L+ 
setting) would spare the possible confounding effects from added chemotherapy in the 1L setting. 
Hence, the chosen study population mimics that from the randomised phase III OAK study (Study 
GO28915), which investigated atezolizumab versus docetaxel, and was the basis for the approval of 
atezolizumab in the 2L+ setting of advanced NSCLC.

Efficacy was not the primary endpoint of the single pivotal IMscin001 study, but it was evaluated as a 
secondary objective. The secondary endpoints were ORR, DoR, PFS, and OS, which are considered 
appropriate. 
Since the chosen study population has a short life expectancy and an expected PFS of less than 3 
months, the exposure of atezolizumab was also short.  
The screening failure rate was (35%) in the pivotal study and the main reasons for this issue are 
considered acceptable. Overall, major protocol deviations occurred more often in the Atezo IV arm 
than in the Atezo SC arm in the pivotal IMscin001 study (51.6% vs 41.7%, respectively). Most of those 
deviations were procedural (Atezo IV 45.2% vs Atezo SC 35.2%) and related to adherence to the 
protocol-defined schedule of PK assessments, e.g. key PK or ADA samples were not done or done 
outside of window in 25% of the cases.  
The distribution of baseline demographic characteristics is not completely balanced between both arms 
of the study, probably because there were no stratification factors used. Hence, the patients in the 
Atezo SC arm were slightly younger than those from the Atezo IV arm (63 vs 66 years), there were 
more white patients in the Atezo SC arm than in the Atezo IV arm (70.4% vs 59.7%), and there were 
more patients from Europe/Middle East in the Atezo SC arm than in the Atezo IV arm (51.4% vs 
40.3%). Of note, there were also more patients with ECOG PS (Performance Status) 0 in the Atezo SC 
arm than in the Atezo IV arm (27.1% vs 22.6%), which could have affected the overall study results in 
favour of the SC arm, because ECOG PS is a well-known prognostic factor in the advanced cancer 
setting.  
There was also a difference in the fraction of PD-L1 positive patients between the arms, because fewer 
patients in the IV arm had positive PD-L1 status than in the SC arm (32.2% vs 44.5%).  However, this 
imbalance is not considered to have had a significant impact on the conclusion and interpretability of 
the efficacy and overall study results. Most patients were current or previous smokers (70%). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The MAH had initially submitted data from the primary analysis of the pivotal study IMscin001 with a 
median follow-up time of 4.7 months (DCO 26 April 2022). A post hoc updated analysis was performed 
9 months after the primary analysis with a median survival duration of follow-up of 9.5 months. The 
updated confirmed ORR in the Atezo IV arm compared to the Atezo SC arm was 10.5% (95%CI: 5.70; 
17.26) vs. 11% (95%CI: 7.39; 15.63), respectively. All responders achieved PR and no CRs were 
observed in either arm. To contextualise, the observed ORR in a similar study population from the OAK 
study was 14%, so the currently observed ORR in the pivotal study is slightly lower than expected.  
The updated confirmed median DoR was 15.1 months (95%CI: 5.6; NE) in the Atezo SC arm versus 
11.2 months (95%CI: 4.2, NE) in the IV Atezo arm. 
Approximately 88% of the patients had a PFS event at the updated DCO of 16 January 2023, which 
provided an additional 9 months of follow-up. The updated median PFS was 2.8 months (95%CI: 
2.7;4.1) in the Atezo SC arm and 2.9 months (95%CI: 1.8;4.2) in the Atezo IV arm. The KM curves 
overlap and PFS is considered comparable between both arms. Of note, a similar median PFS was 
observed in the atezolizumab arm from the referenced OAK study (2.8 months).  
At the time of the updated DCO, 58.3% of patients had died in the Atezo SC arm versus 63.7% in the 
Atezo IV arm; hence, the OS data is now quite mature. The updated median OS is 10.7 months and 
10.1 months in the SC vs IV arm, respectively, which is considered similar. It is noted that the updated 
data now shows that there were slightly more deaths in the IV arm compared to the SC arm, so the 
initial signal of more deaths in the SC arm is no longer an issue. Moreover, it should be noted that the 
single pivotal study was not powered for OS although overall survival is considered an important

efficacy endpoint in this patient population, as the OAK study showed an OS benefit with Atezo 
compared to docetaxel in a similar study population.   
Subgroup analyses of ORR and PFS were conducted initially and after updated subgroup analyses of 
PFS have been provided. These updated results minimise concerns regarding efficacy in the subgroups 
of the patients who had tumours with squamous histology and presence of liver metastases at 
baseline.

Updated SAEs 
As of the Safety Update CCOD, the proportion of patients who experienced SAEs was lower in the 
Atezo SC arm compared to the Atezo IV arm (19.4% Atezo SC vs. 27.4% Atezo IV; Table 5). The most 
frequently reported (≥2%) SAEs by PT were pneumonia and COVID 19. There were no SAEs that were 
at least 2% higher in incidence in the Atezo SC arm compared to the Atezo IV arm. The proportions of 
patients with treatment-related SAEs were comparable between the two treatment arms (2.0% Atezo 
SC vs. 3.2% Atezo IV). 
Deaths 
Of the 14 Grade 5 AEs in the Atezo SC arm, 2 were considered by the investigator as treatment-related 
(pneumonia aspiration and toxic epidermal necrolysis) versus none in the IV arm. As of the Safety 
Update CCOD, Grade 5 AEs were reported in 6.5% in both the Atezo SC arm and Atezo IV arm. Since 
the primary CCOD, a total of six additional Grade 5 AEs were reported (2 in the Atezo SC arm and 4 in 
the Atezo IV arm), however, none of the Grade 5 AEs reported in either arms since the primary CCOD 
were considered related to atezolizumab by the investigator.

2.6.8.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with atezolizumab. 
Since atezolizumab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug 
interactions are expected.

2.6.8.8.  Post marketing experience 
Since the International Birth Date (18 May 2016) through 17 May 2022, an estimated cumulative total 
of 310,426 patients have received atezolizumab from marketing experience (United States n=115,794; 
European Union n=91,547; Japan n=34,890; Rest of the World n=68,196). No new or unexpected 
safety findings were identified in the post-marketing setting for atezolizumab when used as a 
monotherapy in the most recent Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER 1114851). 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Intravenous formulations of atezolizumab has been approved in Europe since 2017, so the safety 
profile of atezolizumab has been well characterised. 
The safety evaluation of Atezo SC to treat patients in all approved indications with Atezo IV is based on 
data of atezolizumab as monotherapy from part 2 of the IMscin001 study comparing the incidence and 
severity of AEs between its two treatment arms: Atezo IV and Atezo SC. The size of the safety pool of 
Atezo SC (n=247) is considered acceptable as similar safety pool sizes has been accepted in earlier 
conducted IV/SC trials. The safety profile of Atezo SC has been compared to the Atezo Mono pool 2 of 
the SmPC consisting of studies with atezolizumab as monotherapy (n=4349). 
Updated exposure with a median exposure of 3.5 months and 3.2 months in the treatment arms, 
respectively, has been provided DCO (16 January 2023), respectively. The median number of doses 
administered increased from 4 to 6 for Atezo SC and 5 for Atezo IV. Longer exposure is not considered 
obtainable in the pivotal study setting of 2L NSCLC, which is supported by the information that only 
16% of the patients are still on treatment at DCO. 
Updated safety results from IMscin001 study showed that AEs any Grade observed in both arms across 
the study period were observed in slightly more patients in the Atezo SC arm (Atezo IV 83.9% vs 
Atezo SC 88.3%). The most common AEs observed were for both arms fatigue, dyspnoea, decreased 
appetite, cough, hyponatraemia and hyperglycaemia, which is comparable with the known safety 
profile of atezolizumab IV and is as expected in the studied patient population.  
Grade 3/4 AEs were observed in 31.5% vs 20.6% in the Atezo IV and the Atezo SC treatment arms, 
respectively. The most frequent Grade 3/4 AEs in both arms were pneumonia, hyponatraemia, 
COVID-19, hypokalaemia, and anaemia. Grade 5 AEs were similar in both arms (6.5%) and although 
six additional Grade 5 AEs were reported with updated data (2 in the Atezo SC arm and 4 in the Atezo 
IV arm), none of the events were considered treatment-related. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in 27.4% in the Atezo IV and 19.4% in the Atezo SC 
arm of the trial. The most frequent observed SAE in both treatment arms was pneumonia and Covid-
19. Updated data show that the frequency of deaths was similar in both arms, i.e. 58.3% in the Atezo 
SC arm and 63.7% in the Atezo IV arm, with the leading cause of death being progressive disease 
(86.8% vs. 87.3%, respectively).  
There were a similar proportion of patients who experienced immune-mediated events in both 
treatment arms (30.8% Atezo SC vs. 28.2% Atezo IV), and the most frequently reported immune-
mediated events were hepatitis (diagnosis and lab abnormalities), rash and hypothyroidism, mostly of 
grade 1-2.  
Grade 3 adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were reported in a similar frequency in both arms 
(4.0%), with no Grade 4 AESIs reported. No new Grade 5 AESIs, infusion related reactions (IRR) or 
injection site reactions (ISR) were reported since the primary safety CCOD One Grade 5 event of toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN) was reported in the Atezo SC arm, which was considered to be treatment-

related. TEN is already mentioned in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the existing SmPC for the IV presentations. 
More patients needed dose interruptions and systemic corticosteroids in the Atezo SC arm compared to 
the Atezo IV arm.  
Reactions related to the administration route of atezolizumab treatment differed between arms: while 
systemic Grade 1-2 reactions was more common in the IV arm (3.2% vs. 0%), local injection site 
reactions (ISR) were more frequent in the SC arm (4.5% vs. 0%). This is reflected in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. No serious events were reported or led to treatment interruptions, discontinuations or required 
the use of corticosteroids. The most frequent events were injection site pain (2.4%) and injection site 
reaction (1.6%).  
The Applicant was asked to discuss the higher frequency of electrolyte disturbances (hyponatriaemia, 
hyperglycaemia, hyperkaliaemia, hypercalcaemia, hypomagnesiamia and hypercreatinaemia) in the IV 
atezo arm and it was clarified that although the updated safety results show a higher frequency of 
electrolyte disturbances in the atezo IV arm, most events were of grade 1-2 severity, so they were 
generally manageable. The difference may be due to a higher frequency of concomitant medications 
that could impact electrolyte balance in the Atezo IV arm compared to the Atezo SC arm, such as 
diuretics (15.3% vs. 9.3%), agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (18.5% vs. 15.8%), drugs 
for constipation (16.1% vs. 13.0%), and analgesics (58.9% vs. 51.0%). Moreover, there were also a 
higher number of patients with concurrent medical conditions that could impact electrolyte balance in 
the IV arm compared to the SC arm such as hypertension (41.1% vs. 35.2%), dyslipidemia (15.3% vs. 
7.3%), and diabetes mellitus (12.1% vs. 4.9%). This explanation is considered clinically plausible and 
acceptable.  
In the pivotal IMscin001 study, the incidence of treatment-emergent anti-atezolizumab antibodies 
(ADA’s) in patients treated with the subcutaneous versus the intravenous formulation of atezolizumab 
could be considered comparable (19.5% [43/221] and 13.9% [15/108], respectively), following a 
median of 2.8 months of treatment. The limited exposure and sample size preclude any firm conclusion 
regarding the development of ADA’s with the SC formulation. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in patients treated with the subcutaneous formulation of atezolizumab was 
5.4% (12/224); however, the clinical relevance of the development of these are unknown. 
Overall, a similar frequency of any Grade AEs, Grade 3-4 AEs and SAEs were observed in both 
treatment arms and no new safety signals were observed.    
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In conclusion, updated safety data from the pivotal study IMscin001 study show a similar and 
acceptable safety profile in both treatment arms (atezolizumab IV and SC), except for numerically 
higher incidence of injection site reactions in the SC arm. This is reflected in the product information. 
No new safety signals have been observed.

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The list of safety concerns, pharmacovigilance plan and risk minimisations measures remain 
unchanged for the new SC formulation. The existing pharmacovigilance plan and risk minimisations 
measures are considered sufficient to mitigate the risks of Tecentriq for both the IV formulation and 
the SC formulation in all approved indications. 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 24.2 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  No significant changes impacting the readability of the package leaflet are made. In particular, 
key safety messages are not affected by this extension. The new additions follow the same 
structure and use similar descriptions and terminology as used in the approved package leaflet. 
• 
The target group of users for the SC formulation will be the same group of users as for the IV 
formulation. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The line extension for atezolizumab SC at 1875 mg (flat dose) solution for injection every 3 weeks 
includes all current and future approved indications for atezolizumab IV, i.e., as monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy (ies) for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma (UC), non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in various clinical settings. 
Assessment report  
EMA/537504/2023  
Page 107/114 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The pivotal study (IMscin001) that serves as basis for this application is conducted in a study 
population with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the 2L+ setting.  
The claimed added benefit that atezolizumab SC would address (in comparison to already available 
atezolizumab IV) is a less invasive and faster administration, which can reduce the strain on medical 
centres with respect to time and resources required to prepare and administer IV therapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study for the claimed indications is the open-label, 2:1 randomized, multicentre Phase 
Ib/III Study BP40657 (IMscin001), in which 371 patients with previously treated locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC were randomised to either atezolizumab SC 1875 mg Q3W (n=247) or atezolizumab 
IV 1200 mg Q3W (n=124).   
The study population was immunotherapy-naïve, with any PD-L1 status and for whom prior platinum-
based therapy had failed.  
The primary endpoint was to show non-inferiority of PK for the SC vs. the IV formulation of 
atezolizumab. Secondary endpoints were ORR, DOR, PFS and OS and safety. The MAH had initially 
submitted data from the primary analysis of the pivotal study IMscin001 with a median follow-up time 
of 4.7 months (DCO 26 April 2022). During the procedure, updated efficacy and safety data were also 
provided with an additional 9 months of follow-up (DCO 16 January 2023). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  The PK co-primary endpoints (observed Ctrough and model-predicted AUC0-21 d at Cycle 1) were 
met: GMR of serum atezolizumab Ctrough,SC/Ctrough,IV values at Cycle 1 was 1.05 (90% CI: 
0.88, 1.24), while GMR of model predicted serum atezolizumab AUC0-21 d,SC/AUC0-21 d,IV values 
at Cycle 1 was 0.87 (90% CI: 0.83, 0.92). The corresponding lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI 
for both co-primary endpoints were above the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.8, and thus 
PK non-inferiority of SC over IV is established. 
•  All patients in the SC arm had drug exposure within the full E-R range for atezolizumab IV 
and   99% of SC patients had drug concentrations above the receptor saturation threshold of 6 
g/mL. Further similar dose exposure response relationship was observed in all of the IV 
indications.  
•  The updated confirmed ORR was 10.5% (95%CI: 5.70, 17.26) for Atezo IV vs. 11.0% (95%CI: 
7.39, 15.63) for Atezo SC, respectively. All responders achieved PR and no CRs were observed in 
both arms. 
•  The median DoR was 15.1(95%CI: 5.6, NE) in the SC arm vs 11.2 (95%CI: 4.2, NE) in the IV arm. 
•  The median PFS was 2.8 months (95% CI: 2.7;4.1) in the Atezo SC arm and 2.9 months (95% CI: 
1.8;4.2) in the Atezo IV arm. 
•  The median OS was 10.7 months (95% CI: 8.5; 13.8) in the Atezo SC arm and 10.1 months (95% 
CI: 7.5; 12.1) in the Atezo IV arm.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
None. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  Updated safety results from IMscin001 study showed that AEs any Grade observed in both arms 
across the study period were observed with slightly more patients in the Atezo SC arm (Atezo IV 
83.9% vs Atezo SC 88.3%). The most common AEs observed in the study were for both arms 
fatigue, dyspnoea, decreased appetite, cough, hyponatraemia and hyperglycaemia. 
•  Grade 3/4 AEs were observed in 31.5% vs 20.6% in the Atezo IV and the Atezo SC treatment arms, 
respectively. The most frequent Grade 3/4 AEs in both arms were pneumonia, hyponatraemia, 
COVID-19, hypokalaemia, and anaemia. 
•  Grade 5 AEs were similar in both arms (6.5%) and although six additional Grade 5 AEs were 
reported with updated data, none of the events were considered treatment-related. 
•  SAEs were observed in 27.4% in the Atezo IV and 19.4% in the Atezo SC arm of the trial. The most 
frequent observed SAE in both treatment arms was pneumonia and Covid-19. Updated data show 
that the frequency of deaths was similar in both arms, i.e. 58.3% in the Atezo SC arm and 63.7% 
in the Atezo IV arm, with the leading cause of death being progressive disease (86.8% vs. 87.3%, 
respectively).   
•  Updated safety data show a similar proportion of patients who experienced immune-mediated 
events in both treatment arms (30.8% Atezo SC vs. 28.2% Atezo IV). Consistent with the primary 
DCO, the most frequently reported immune-mediated reactions were hepatitis (diagnosis and lab 
abnormalities), rash and hypothyroidism.  
•  Reactions related to the administration route of atezolizumab treatment differed between arms: 
while systemic Grade 1-2 reactions were more common in the IV arm (3.2% vs. 0%), local injection 
site reactions (ISR) were predominant in the SC arm (4.5% vs. 0%), most commonly injection site 
pain (2.4%) and injection site reaction (1.6%).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The line extension for atezolizumab SC is based on a single pivotal trial (IMscin001). The primary 
objective was to show non-inferiority of atezolizumab SC over atezolizumab IV from a PK perspective, 
and secondary objectives included efficacy and safety endpoints.

Even if the non-inferiority testing of co-primary endpoints (observed Ctrough and model-predicted 
AUC0-21 d at Cycle 1) was met, the model-predicted exposure in the SC arm was 13% lower than for 
the IV arm and the CI limits were narrow around the point estimate and did not include 1.0, i.e. the 
difference seemed significant. Upon request, the Applicant developed a new Pop PK model based only 
on Cycle 1 PK data from IMScin001 Cohort 4 and Cohort 5. The new model had a similar structure to 
the previous model but included a lag time for absorption. The bioavailability was estimated to 0.609. 
Only two covariates were retained in the model, namely body weight effect on CL and sex on Vp. The 
effect of body weight on CL was low with a high RSE and the 95% CI containing the null. The IIV 
shrinkage was moderate to high. However, from the provided diagnostic plots, the new Cycle 1 based 
model provided a better fit of the Cycle 1 data (IV and SC) compared to the previous model even the 
absorption was still slightly overpredicted.  
When the new model was used to predict Cycle 1 AUC0-21d for non-inferiority testing of the SC versus 
IV doses in IMScin001, it resulted in a GMR of 0.86 and a 90% CI of 0.81 to 0.91. This result is 
comparable to the initial result obtained with the previous model, however, the updated Pop PK model 
shows that a better description of e.g. the absorption phase does not influence the non-inferiority test 
outcome. It is therefore agreed that non-inferiority of atezolizumab SC versus IV have been 
established, based on both the observed (Cycle 1 Ctrough) and the model-predicted (Cycle 1 AUC0-
21d) end-points. 
Moreover, the results from the dose-ranging IV clinical study showed that no statistically significant 
relationship was associated with efficacy and atezolizumab exposures and  all SC patients had drug 
exposure within the full E-R range for atezolizumab IV and   99% of SC patients had drug 
concentrations above the receptor saturation threshold of 6 g/mL. Further, a similar 
dose-exposure-response relationship was observed in all of the IV indications. It is thus accepted that 
patients treated with SC atezolizumab, including patients with drug exposure at the extreme lower 
end, achieve adequate drug exposures despite the higher variability. 
Updated efficacy data show a similar ORR, DoR, PFS and median OS in both arms. The short median 
PFS of ~2.8 months in both treatment arms does not allow for a long exposure; which is to be 
expected in the chosen 2L+ setting of advanced NSCLC.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
PK non-inferiority of SC vs IV atezolizumab, the primary objective of pivotal study IMscin001, has been 
established. Moreover, the efficacy of SC and IV atezolizumab is considered comparable regarding 
ORR, DoR, PFS and OS. Since the safety profiles of both administrations were similar except for more 
injection site reactions in the SC arm, and no new safety signals were observed, the benefit-risk 
balance for the subcutaneous formulation is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Tecentriq is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of, Tecentriq new strength (1875mg), new pharmaceutical 
form (solution for injection) and new route of administration (subcutaneous use) is favourable in the 
following indication(s): 
Urothelial carcinoma (UC)  
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic UC: 
• after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy, or 
• who are considered cisplatin ineligible, and whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 5% (see 
section 5.1). 
Early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated as adjuvant treatment following complete resection and 
platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with NSCLC with a high risk of recurrence whose 
tumours have PD-L1 expression on ≥ 50% of tumour cells (TC) and who do not have EGFR mutant or 
ALK-positive NSCLC (see section 5.1 for selection criteria). 
Metastatic NSCLC   
Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. In patients with EGFR mutant or 
ALK-positive NSCLC, Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is 
indicated only after failure of appropriate targeted therapies (see section 5.1). 
Tecentriq, in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of 
adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who do not have EGFR mutant or ALK-positive 
NSCLC (see section 5.1). 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
NSCLC whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% TC or ≥ 10% tumour-infiltrating immune cells 
(IC) and who do not have EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC (see section 5.1). 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC should 
also have received targeted therapies before receiving Tecentriq (see section 5.1). 
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)  
Tecentriq, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, is indicated for the first-line treatment of 
adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) (see section 5.1).  
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC whose tumours have PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and 
who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced or unresectable HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy (see section 5.1).

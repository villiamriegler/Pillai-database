Summary of the risk management plan  
Summary of risk management plan for Lenalidomide Mylan (lenalidomide) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Lenalidomide Mylan. The RMP details 
important risks of lenalidomide, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about lenalidomide's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Lenalidomide Mylan's summary of product  characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how it should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Lenalidomide  Mylan  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  the 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Lenalidomide 
Mylan's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Lenalidomide  Mylan  as  monotherapy  is  authorised  for  maintenance  treatment  of  adult  patients 
with  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  who  have  undergone  autologous  stem  cell 
transplantation.  
Lenalidomide  Mylan  as  combination  therapy  with  dexamethasone,  or  bortezomib  and 
dexamethasone, or melphalan and prednisone (see SmPC section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Lenalidomide Mylan in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
It contains lenalidomide as the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Lenalidomide  Mylan’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
lenalidomide Mylan’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of Lenalidomide Mylan, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Lenalidomide Mylan's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  events  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  via  signal  management  activities  and  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
In the case of Lenalidomide Mylan, these routine measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimisation measures, mentioned under relevant risks below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of Lenalidomide Mylan are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further  investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  taken  by 
patients. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Lenalidomide Mylan. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, 
but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to 
be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine/use in special patient populations etc.);

II.B Summary of important risks  
Important Identified Risk: Teratogenicity 
Evidence  for  linking  the 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide, which is known 
risk to the medicine 
to cause serious birth defects and death of the foetus. In nonclinical 
studies,  lenalidomide  induced  malformations  similar  to  those 
described  with  thalidomide.  Therefore,  a  teratogenic  effect  of 
lenalidomide  is  expected  and  lenalidomide  is  contraindicated 
during pregnancy.

Important identified Risk: Serious Infection due to Neutropenia 
Evidence  for  linking  the 
In clinical trials conducted for the originator product, neutropenia 
risk to the medicine 
has  been  reported  as  a  consequence  of  lenalidomide  treatment;  ≥ 
Grade 3 and ≥ Grade 4 infections have occurred in the context of 
neutropenia (any grade).  
Risk 
factors  and 
risk 
Haematological  malignancies  by  themselves  or  by  virtue  of  their 
groups 
therapeutic  strategies,  chemotherapy,  radiation  or  haematopoietic 
stem cell transplant put patients at risk of infections. Risk factors 
include myeloma-related innate immunodeficiency, which involves 
various  arms  of 
the 
immune  system  and 
includes  B-cell 
dysfunction,  polyclonal  hypogammaglobulinemia, 
treatment 
associated  organ  dysfunctions  and  comorbidities  including  renal 
failure,  respiratory  compromise,  severe  alimentary  mucosal 
damage,  dexamethasone  induced  hyperglycemia,  multisystem 
involvement  due  to  myeloma  associated  deposition  diseases. 
Elderly  age  is  also  risk  factor.  Lenalidomide  treatment  in 
combination with dexamethasone in MM patients with at least one 
prior therapy is associated with a higher incidence of neutropenia 
compared to placebo-dexamethasone treated patients.

Important identified Risk: Second Primary Malignancy 
Evidence  for  linking  the 
In clinical trials, AML and B-cell malignancies have been reported 
risk to the medicine 
in patients treated with lenalidomide. 
Based on clinical trial data, lenalidomide may increase the risk of 
NMSC. Patients with multiple myeloma also have an increased risk 
of NMSC. 
Patients  treated  with  lenalidomide  may  be  at  increased  risk  of 
developing  new  cancers.  The  reason  is  not  clear,  but  further 
investigations are being undertaken for the originator product. 
Risk 
factors  and 
risk 
An  increase  of  second  primary  malignancies  (SPM)  has  been 
groups 
observed  in  clinical  trials  in  previously  treated  myeloma  patients 
receiving lenalidomide/dexamethasone (3.98 per 100 person-years) 
compared  to  controls  (1.38 per  100 person-years).  Non-invasive 
SPM comprise basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers. Most of the 
invasive SPMs were solid tumour malignancies. 
In clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients not 
eligible  for  transplant,  a  4.9-fold  increase  in  incidence  rate  of 
hematologic  SPM  (cases  of  AML,  MDS)  has  been  observed  in 
patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and 
 
 
Important identified Risk: Second Primary Malignancy 
prednisone until progression (1.75 per 100 person-years) compared 
with  melphalan 
in  combination  with  prednisone  (0.36 per 
100 person-years). 
A 2.12-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been 
observed 
in  patients  receiving 
lenalidomide  (9  cycles) 
in 
combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.57 per 100 person-
years)  compared  with  melphalan  in  combination  with  prednisone 
(0.74 per 100 person-years). 
In  patients 
receiving 
lenalidomide 
in  combination  with 
dexamethasone until progression or for 18 months, the hematologic 
SPM incidence rate (0.16 per 100 person-years) was not increased 
as  compared  to  thalidomide  in  combination  with  melphalan  and 
prednisone (0.79 per 100 person-years). 
A 1.3-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been 
observed  in  patients  receiving  lenalidomide  in  combination  with 
dexamethasone  until  progression  or 
for  18 months 
(1.58 
per 100person years) compared to thalidomide in combination with 
melphalan and prednisone (1.19 per 100 person-years). 
In  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  patients 
receiving 
lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, 
the  hematologic  SPM  incidence  rate  was  0.00  –  0.16  per  100 
person-years and the incidence rate of solid tumour SPM 0.21 – 1.04 
per 100 person-years. 
The  increased  risk  of  secondary  primary  malignancies  associated 
with  lenalidomide is  relevant  also  in  the  context  of NDMM  after 
stem  cell  transplantation.  Though  this  risk  is  not  yet  fully 
characterized, it should be kept in mind when considering and using 
Lenalidomide Mylan in this setting. 
The  incidence  rate  of  hematologic  malignancies,  most  notably 
AML,  MDS  and  B-cell  malignancies  (including  Hodgkin’s 
Important identified Risk: Second Primary Malignancy 
lymphoma),  was  1.31  per  100  person-years  for  the  lenalidomide 
arms and 0.58 per 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.02 per 
100 person-years for patients exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT 
and  0.60 per  100  person-years  for  patients  not-exposed  to 
lenalidomide after ASCT). The incidence rate of solid tumour SPMs 
was  1.36 per  100  person-years  for  the  lenalidomide  arms  and 
1.05 per  100  person  years  for  the  placebo  arms  (1.26 per  100 
person-years for patients exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT and 
0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide 
after ASCT). 
The  risk  of  occurrence  of  hematologic  SPM  must  be  taken  into 
account  before  initiating  treatment  with  lenalidomide  either  in 
combination  with  melphalan  or  immediately  following  high-dose 
melphalan and ASCT. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients 
before  and  during  treatment  using  standard  cancer  screening  for 
occurrence of SPM and institute treatment as indicated.

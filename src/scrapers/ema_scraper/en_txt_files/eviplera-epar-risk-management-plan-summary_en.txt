SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR EVIPLERA 
(EMTRICITABINE/RILPIVIRINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL 
FUMARATE) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Eviplera. The RMP details important 
risks of Eviplera, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Eviplera’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Eviplera’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Eviplera should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Eviplera should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Eviplera’s RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What is it Used for 
Eviplera is authorized for treatment of adults infected with HIV 1 without known mutations 
associated with resistance to the NNRTI class, tenofovir or emtricitabine and with a viral load 
≤ 100,000 HIV 1 RNA copies/mL (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains emtricitabine 
(FTC), rilpivirine (RPV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as the active substance and it 
is given orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of Eviplera’s benefits can be found in Eviplera’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/eviplera 
II. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of Eviplera, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Eviplera’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimizes its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Eviplera is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Eviplera are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Eviplera. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B. 
Summary of Important Risks 
Eviplera has been assigned the legal status of a medicine subject to medical prescription in the 
European Union (EU), whereby therapy should be initiated by a doctor experienced in the 
management of HIV infection (as described in section 4.2 of the SmPC).

Summary of Important Risk(s) and Missing Information 
Important Identified Risk 
Renal Toxicity (TDF) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphatemia and PRT 
(including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of TDF in clinical 
trials and postmarketing setting.

groups

Measure(s) 
Additional 
Pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Risk factors for renal events include advanced HIV disease (low CD4 count at the 
start of treatment), low weight, older age, renal impairment before starting therapy, 
use of other medicines that are damaging to kidneys, high blood pressure, and also 
being infected with hepatitis C.

Important Identified Risk 
Bone Events Due to Proximal Renal Tubulopathy/Loss of Bone Mineral 
Density (TDF) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Clinical trial data indicate that decreases in BMD observed following the 
initiation of ART appear to be greater with regimens containing TDF compared to 
those without TDF. 
Analysis of postmarketing spontaneous AE reports has indicated that there may 
be rare occurrences of osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently 
contributing to fractures) as a consequence of PRT in patients treated with TDF. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
HIV infection is known to be associated with bone disease.

1.  Background information on the annual renewal 
The European Commission issued on 29 January 2021, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for 
Vaxzevria. This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete 
ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called Specific 
Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA. 
A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. 
Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH AstraZeneca AB, submitted to the Agency on 23 July 2021 an 
application for renewal of the conditional MA for Vaxzevria. The expiry date of the MA is 29 January 
2022. 
The period covered by this annual renewal is 29 January to 31 May 2021.

Two specific obligations (SOB) were established at the time of the conditional marketing authorisation. 
After that, some points in SOB 013 and 014 were updated as a consequence of variations, some of 
them to add new manufacturing sites. The MAH is sending monthly updates. SOB 013 c, e and f are 
considered solved.  
Clinical 
Since the granting of the conditional MA, the MAH has submitted the following primary analyses 
regarding SOBs 019 and 020: 
SOB 019: Pooled data from the four trials (COV001, COV002, COV003, and COV005) at data 
cut-off date of 07 December 2020   
Within this type II variation, the MAH provided the pooled efficacy analysis of the four trials, since 
trials COV001 and COV005 had reached the predefined criterion (having at least 5 cases of COVID-19 
lab confirmed disease) for being included in the pooled efficacy analysis. Regarding safety data, the 
MAH submitted the pooled data from the four trials but at data cut-off date of 07 December 2020 
(DCO2). The results from DCO2 resulted in an update of the safety profile of Vaxzevria in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. The following adverse drug reactions (ADR) were added with their respective frequency: 
abdominal pain (uncommon), urticaria (uncommon), pain in extremity (common), influenza-like illness 
(common), asthenia (common) and lethargy (uncommon). Based on the data reviewed at the DCO02, 
the benefit-risk profile of Vaxzevria has been shown to be consistently favourable, over two data cut-
offs, for the proposed indication in adults from age 18 years and older, including adults from age 65 
years and above, as well as those with comorbidities. CHMP issued a positive opinion on 24 June 2021 
in procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0002. 
CHMP assessment comment 
It follows a summary of the assessment of this variation for which CHMP issued a positive opinion on 24 
June 2021 in procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0002. 
The clinical data on which the CMA for Vaxzevria was granted came from 4 studies: COV001 (Phase 
I/II); COV002 (Phase II/III); COV003 (Phase II/III) and COV005 (Phase I/II).  The CMA was granted 
based on a pooled efficacy analysis from trials COV002 and COV003, and a pooled safety analysis 
based on all four trials. Efficacy data from the interim pooled efficacy analysis (DCO1, 04 November 
2020) have previously been submitted in the initial marketing authorisation application (MAA). During 
assessment of that MAA, pooled efficacy data from trials COV002 (UK) and COV003 (Brazil) (at data 
cut-off date of 07 December 2020 -DCO2) were also submitted by the MAH and these data were the 
basis on which the CHMP granted a positive opinion for a CMA. These data were also the main data 
stated in the SmPC. Regarding safety, at the time of granting a CMA, the data analysed were from a 
pooled analysis of the 4 University of Oxford-sponsored studies COV001 (UK), COV002, COV003, and 
COV005 (South Africa) at DCO1.  
The MAH provided under variation II/0002 the pooled efficacy analysis of the four trials, since trials 
COV001 and COV005 reached the predefined criterion for being included in the pooled efficacy

analysis. Regarding safety data, the MAH submits the pooled data from the four trials but at data cut-
off date of 07 December 2020 (DCO2).  
The efficacy analysis described in that variation incorporated data from trials COV001 and COV005. It 
is noted that trials COV001 and COV005 contributed each with only five COVID-19 cases (2 and 8 
cases in the AZD1222 (Vaxzevria) and in the control group, respectively). As expected from the few 
new cases incorporated, the estimates of vaccine efficacy (VE) determined (for primary and secondary 
endpoints) when using the pooled data from the four trials are very similar to those obtained when 
considering only the trials COV002 and COV003.  
The immunogenicity analysis submitted included 841 additional subjects that are added to the data 
from 2,871 subjects submitted at DC01. These new data from more than 800 subjects did not modify 
the conclusion reached at the time of the CMA was granted. 
In conclusion, in relation to the vaccine efficacy analysis the data submitted in variation II/0002 
corresponding to the pooled efficacy analysis of four clinical trials (COV001; COV002; COV003 and 
COV005) do not change the conclusions reached at the time the CMA was granted.  
The safety update presented (as of the data cut-off date of 7th December 2020) modestly extends 
both the size and long term follow up of the safety database (initial cut-off 4th November 2020). It 
included 12,282 subjects in the AZD1222 group (+261 subjects) and 11,962 in the control group. The 
proportion of subjects who had received both vaccine doses increased from approximately 55% of the 
pooled data set population up to 85.1% and 85.3% in AZD1222 and control group, respectively. In 
addition, in this DCO2 allowed for a median follow-up of > 2 months after the second dose. As it can 
be expected, demographics and baseline characteristics do not differ substantially from those of the 
initially submitted set of data and were well balanced among treatment groups. Most of the 
participants were adults aged 18 to 64 (90.6%), only 9.4% of participants age 65 or older. 
As a consequence of the small increase of the database, overall frequencies of either solicited local and 
systemic adverse events (AEs), unsolicited AEs, serious AEs and adverse events of special interest 
(AESI) presented remained barely unchanged compared to those initially provided. No new unexpected 
safety findings have been identified based on the data cut-off date as of 7th December 2020, however 
new ADR were added to the SmPC: abdominal pain (uncommon), urticaria (uncommon), pain in 
extremity (common), influenza-like illness (common), asthenia (common) and lethargy (uncommon).   
In relation to this SOB 019, it is still pending the submission of the final analysis from the pooled 
pivotal studies and the final clinical study reports, which are due by 31 May 2022. 
SOB 020 Study D8110C00001 - Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre study assessing the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of AZD1222 compared 
to saline placebo for the prevention of COVID-19 conducted in the USA, Chile, and Peru. 
This study report on the primary efficacy analysis was submitted on 31 May 2021 and it has been 
assessed within procedure II/0026.  
Study D8110C0001 is a phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study 
assessing the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of Vaxzevria compared to saline placebo for the 
prevention of COVID-19 in adults ≥ 18 years of age who are healthy or have medically stable chronic 
diseases and are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and COVID-19. All participants will 
remain on study for 2 years following administration of first dose of study intervention (Day 730). 
The primary efficacy analysis for study D8110C0001 was submitted on 31 May 2021. These results 
confirm the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of Vaxzevria in 32,379 participants 18 years of age or 
older, of whom 19,179 (59.2%) had one or more pre-existing comorbidities and 7,238 (22.4%) were

≥65 years of age at enrolment. 
CHMP assessment comment 
It follows a summary of the assessment of this variation. 
The EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0026 variation focused on assessing the data from trial D8110C00001. The 
trial was carried out in the US, Chile and Peru. In this trial, a time interval of 4 weeks between doses 
was selected whereas this period varied between 4 and 12 weeks according to the pooled efficacy data 
on which the CMA was granted. 
The applicant has assessed the humoral immunogenicity in a subset of 3,000 participants. The 
submitted data are enough to conclude that Vaxzevria induces a strong immune response against the 
S protein, which response is in line with the data reflected in the EPAR. This is also in line with data 
observed in the phase I/II study in Japan (D8111C00002) (assessed in variation 
EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0019).   
The Vaccine efficacy determined against COVID-19 symptomatic illness that occur ≥15 days post 
second dose of study intervention was 74.0% (95%CI: 65.3 – 80.5). Importantly high VE estimate was 
determined both in participants ≥18 to <65 years of age [VE: 72.8% (95% CI: 63.4 – 79.9)] and in 
participants ≥65 years of age [VE: 83.5% (95%CI:  54.2 – 94.1)]. This result is relevant in the clinical 
data did not allow an estimate of vaccine efficacy in subjects over 55 years of age at the time of the 
CMA. 
The cumulative incidence curve of the time to first case of SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Transcriptase-
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) positive symptomatic COVID-19 occurring ≥15 days post second 
dose of study showed separation of the curve for the Vaxzevria group from the placebo group at 
around 15 days post second dose that continues to diverge over time. This result was in line with that 
from the pooled efficacy analysis that was the basis for granting the CMA. 
Robust efficacy was observed regardless of age, gender, and ethnicity. With respect to comorbidities, 
the VE estimates were similar to the overall population for participants with 1, 2 or ≥3 comorbidities, 
and no differences were observed among the comorbidity by age category subgroups. 
A total of 8 severe COVID-19 cases were observed in the placebo group and none in Vaxzevria group, 
a result which indicates VE against severe disease.  
In conclusion, the results from study D8110C00001 are robust and show a significant VE of Vaxzevria 
against symptomatic COVID-19 disease (regardless of severity) and also against severe disease.  
The safety evaluation of Vaxzevria vaccine in study D8110C00001 (data cut-off 5th March 2021) was 
performed on 32,379 participants (21,587 participants in the Vaxzevria group and 10,792 in the 
placebo group). The majority of participants received a two-dose regimen. 
Overall, the observed safety profile in study D8110C00001 is in line with the results of the pooled 
University of Oxford studies submitted in the CMA (data cut-off 4th Nov 2020) and in the variation 
EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0002 (data cut-off 7th Dec 2020 [SOB 019]) and remain as favorable. Less 
frequently solicited AEs were reported after the second dose than after first dose of Vaxzevria. 
However, no difference in the incidences of unsolicited AEs after first and second dose was observed. 
In addition, solicited and unsolicited AEs were reported less frequently in adults aged ≥65 than in 
adults aged 18-64 and higher incidences of solicited and unsolicited AEs were observed in females than 
males. 
No related deaths were reported during the study. The incidence of SAEs and AESIs was low and no 
clinically meaningful imbalances were observed except for facial paralysis and muscle spasms, no other

safety concern was identified. No thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) events were 
reported during the study.   
Overall, the observed safety profile in study D8110C00001 is in line with the results of the pooled 
University of Oxford studies submitted in the CMA (data cut-off 4th Nov 2020) and in the variation 
EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0002 (data cut-off 7th Dec 2020 [SOB019]) and remain as favorable . This study 
has been assessed within variation EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0026 (SOB). 
2.3.  Overall conclusion on Specific Obligation 
In relation to quality SOBs, SOB 013 c, e and f have been fulfilled but the rest of the SOBs are still 
ongoing. The MAH is sending updates according to the agreed plan. Since SOBs 013 and 014 have not 
been completely fulfilled the SOBs as described in Annex II remains. 
In relation to clinical SOBs, SOB 19 and SOB 20, the interim reports (primary analysis) stated in the 
corresponding SOBs have been submitted. Interim data regarding SOB 019 was submitted as expected 
(March 2021) and assessed in variation EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0002, for which a positive CHMP opinion 
was granted on 24 June 2021. The SOB is still not fulfilled, the final pooled analysis and clinical study 
reports (CSRs) are due on 31 May 2022. Regarding SOB 020, the original commitment date for the 
interim data was 30 April 2021, but upon request from the MAH, EMA agreed to revise the 
commitment date to 04 June 2021, when the data was submitted. The data regarding SOB 020 has 
been assessed in variation EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0026, for which a positive CHMP opinion was granted 
on 14 October 2021. The SOB is still not fulfilled, the final clinical study report is due on 31 March 
2024. 
3.  Additional scientific data provided relevant for the 
assessment of the benefit/risk balance 
3.1.  Quality 
No additional information has been submitted in support of this renewal application. An ongoing 
variation in parallel is noted for which there are issues still being addressed. An addendum to the 
Quality Overall Summary (QOS) and expert statement to include editorial updates in line with recent 
post-approval change submissions, is provided.  
3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
Since approval of Vaxzevria, the following additional efficacy data have become available outside of the 
SOBs.  
• 
Immunogenicity from study D8111C00002 (A phase I/II randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled multicentre study in participants aged 18 years or older to determine the safety and 
immunogenicity of COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA, a non-replicating ChAdOx1 vector 
vaccine, for the prevention of COVID-19). In Japanese participants from study D8111C00002, 
antibody titers for the Spike and receptor binding domains (RBD) antigens and for the 
neutralising antibodies (pseudoneutralization) to SARS-CoV-2 increased substantially after the 
first vaccination with AZD1222 and increased further after the second vaccination. The 
seroconversion rates for both the Spike and the RBD antigens at 28 days (Day 57) after the 
second vaccination with AZD1222 were 100%. This study was assessed under procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0019, which has been finalised. 
• 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004. The European Medicines Agency 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/622071/2021  
Page 10/26 
 
 
 
was requested to provide, if possible, a recommendation on the administration of the second 
dose of Vaxzevria on the basis of the available data. On 9 April 2021 the European Commission 
(EC) triggered the above-mentioned procedure (EMEA/H/A-5(3)/1507), which has now 
concluded. 
• 
Post-authorisation measure MEA/010.1. The MAH provided the protocol for “Brand-specific 
COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 disease in Europe”. This protocol is 
developed in the context of the COVIDRIVE study platform. This protocol has already been 
assessed. 
CHMP assessment comment:  
Regarding Japanese study D8111C00002, the data indicate that AZD1222 elicits strong immune 
responses against SARS-CoV-2 in the Japanese adult population across all the age groups (see 
procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0019). The immunogenicity results obtained in this study are in line 
with those that served as the basis for granting the CMA and that are reported in the EPAR. The study 
reports had no regulatory consequences and did not necessitate any changes to the product 
information. 
Regarding Procedure under Article 5(3) for the second dose of Vaxzevria, it was recommended 
adherence to the recommended vaccination posology of two doses as stipulated in the product 
information is vital to benefit from the highest level of protection against the virus. Regarding the 
possibility of administering an mRNA vaccine as a second dose, preliminary results from non-
commercial studies in Spain, Germany and the UK suggested a satisfactory immune response and no 
safety concerns, however further data was awaited and no definitive recommendation could be made 
at that stage. 
It is welcomed that a study to measure the effectiveness of Vaxzevria vaccine is ongoing under the 
umbrella of the COVIDRIVE consortium. 
3.3.  Clinical safety 
Within the current application for CMA renewal, the MAH has not provided any new safety data. The 
MAH submitted the Addendum to the Clinical Overview (ACO), covering the period from 29 January 
2021 and until 31 May 2021.

Overall summary of the safety profile 
The overall safety of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is based on an 
analysis of pooled data from four clinical trials conducted in the United 
Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa. At the time of analysis, 24,244 
participants ≥18 years old had been randomised and received either 
COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca or control. Out of these, 12,282 received 
at least one dose of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, with a median 
duration of follow-up of 4.5 months. 
Demographic characteristics were generally similar among participants 
who received COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca and those who received 
control. Overall, among the participants who received COVID-19 Vaccine 
AstraZeneca, 89.8% were aged 18 to 64 years and 10.2% were 65 years 
of age or older. The majority of recipients were White (75.5%), 9.8% 
were Black and 3.7% were Asian; 55.8% were female and 44.2% male.

During the reporting period, assessments of Monthly Summary Safety update Reports (MSSRs) 
associated with EPITT notifications permitted EMA to identify safety signals and safety topics of 
interest/concern. Those were:  
-  Anaphylactic reactions (EPITT 19668; 17.02.2021) 
-  Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS) (EPITT 19672, 24.02.2021) 
- 
Embolic and thrombotic events SMQ (EPITT 19683; 11.03.21) which involved the 
thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS), as well as thrombosis (with and without 
thrombocytopenia) issues 
- 
Immune Thrombocytopenia (EPITT 19678; 05.03.21) 
-  Acute Macular Outer retinopathy (AMOR) (EPITT 19703; 07.05.21) 
Data related to those topics were carefully reviewed through Monthly Summary Safety Reports 
(MSSRs) or relevant signal procedures leading to several requests to update the product 
information and RMP.  
Changes to the SmPC made for safety reasons:  
The assessment of those safety signals and safety topics led to updated to the SmPC. Some 
additions were requested or implemented after the DLP of this review (in italic in the text).

PRAC conclusion:  The close monitoring of notification reports permitted the early identification 
of safety signals. These were assessed and SmPC were updated quite rapidly.  
The PRAC considers that the new safety topics identified during the reporting period do not modify 
the balance benefit-risk of the product. However, safety data should continue to be closely 
monitored. 
3.4.  Pharmacovigilance inspections 
There were PhV inspections carried out to AZ Saudi Arabia (January 2021), AZ Czech Republic & 
Slovakia (April/May 2021) and AZ Canada (May/June 2021) by the inspecting authorities National 
Pharmacovigilance Centre (Saudi Arabia), HA-SUKL (Slovak Local) and Health Canada, respectively.  
PRAC assessment comment:  
The outcome of three pharmacovigilance inspections were presented. Those inspections were not 
specific to Vaxzevria and did not permit to identify a major problem in relation with the vaccine.

- 
‘Thrombosis’ was included as Important potential risk.  
After the DLP of this renewal, the MAH was requested to include: 
­ 
­ 
‘Guillain-Barré syndrome’ as an important identified risk (PRAC outcome on assessment of 
the 6th MSSR of Vaxzevria – Procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/MEA/027.5) 
‘Thrombocytopenia with or without associated bleeding’ as an important potential risk (3rd 
PRAC recommendation on signal assessment report on ITP with Vaxzevria – Procedure SD 
034 / EPITT 19678) 
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
Minor editorial updates were included during the assessment of this renewal (see attachment 1). 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Vaxzevria (COVID 19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1 S 
[recombinant])) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance 
which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and it is 
approved under a conditional marketing authorisation. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

6.2.  Benefit-risk Balance 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do 
not have an impact on the benefit-risk of Vaxzevria in the approved indication. 
Furthermore, the data collected as part of the specific obligations for Vaxzevria during the period 
covered by this annual renewal continue to support its positive benefit-risk balance in the approved 
indication. 
Favourable effects 
As stated in the EPAR of the conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for Vaxzevria, vaccine efficacy 
determined from pooled analysis of trials COV002 and COV003 for seronegative subjects who received 
two standard doses of 5x1010 vp per dose with a 4-12 week dose interval (i.e. 28 to 84 days) was 
59.5% (95% CI: 45.8, 69.7).  
The data submitted regarding SOB 019 (variation EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0002) provided the pooled 
efficacy analysis of the four trials (COV001; COV002; COV003 and COV005) at data cut-off date of 07 
December 2020. The estimate of vaccine efficacy (VE) determined from this pooled analysis 
(VE=58.8%; 95%CI: 44.6, 69.6) was very similar to that determined from the pooled analysis from 
trials COV002 and COV003. In relation to safety, due to the modest extend of both the size and long-
term exposure of the safety database, the overall frequencies of either solicited local and systemic 
adverse events (AEs), unsolicited AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special 
interest (AESI) presented remain barely unchanged to those approved at the time of the CMA opinion. 
In addition, SOB 020 (variation EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0026) that focused on the assessment of the 
data from trial D8110C00001, provided further reassurance on VE. The primary efficacy analysis 
determined a VE against COVID-19 symptomatic illness that occur ≥15 days post second dose of study 
intervention of 74.0% (95%CI: 65.3 – 80.5). Importantly high VE estimates were determined both in 
participants ≥18 to <65 years of age (yoa) [VE: 72.8% (95% CI: 63.4 – 79.9)] and in participants 
≥65 years of age [VE: 83.5% (95%CI:  54.2 – 94.1)]. This result is relevant in that VE in subjects 
older than 55 yoa could not be demonstrated in the pooled efficacy analysis that served as the basis 
for the CMA.  
At the time of the CMA, the VE regarding prevention of severe COVID-19 could not be estimated since 
the number of cases were low. Data from study D8110C00001 (SOB 020) showed a clear indication of 
vaccine efficacy against severe diseases since there were 0 cases in the AZD1222 group and 8 COVID-
19 cases in the placebo group.  
At the time the CMA was granted, an immune response in terms of both the humoral response against 
S protein (binding antibodies) and SARS-CoV-2 virus (neutralization assays) and the cellular response 
have been shown in vaccinated subjects. This has also been confirmed during the assessment of the 
data from studies submitted after the granting of the CMA such as D8110C00001 (assessed in 
procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0026) and D8111C00002 (clinical trial in Japan; assessed in 
procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0019). 
Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The uncertainties and limitations of favourable effects are similar to those at the time of the initial 
assessment. The principal uncertainties remain on the duration of protection and efficacy in risk 
groups, e.g. pregnant women and immunocompromised subjects. Another uncertainty relates to 
vaccine efficacy against upcoming virus variants of concern. Results described in the EPAR (initial CMA) 
and from SOB 020 indicate that VE against symptomatic COVID-19 starts 2-3 weeks from first dose. 
However, precise VE after receiving one dose has not been properly determined, and it would be

expected to be impacted according to the infecting strain (whether it is the original Wuhan strain or a 
variant). As stated in the SmPC, it is therefore important that a second dose is given after 4 and within 
12 weeks after the first dose to achieve the protection suggested by the main study outcomes. 
In relation to pregnancy, the protocol on the Pregnancy Registry of Women Exposed to AZD1222 
Immediately Before or During Pregnancy as part of the C-VIPER Registry Consortium (D8110C00003; 
Pregistry-sponsored) was agreed by PRAC (EMEA/H/C/0005675/MEA/006.1) 
In relation to immunocompromised subjects a study protocol has been agreed at CHMP (Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/0005675/MEA/009.1).  
Moreover, in order to comply with the planned additional Pharmacovigilance activity milestone included 
in the Risk Management Plan for Vaxzevria to evaluate effectiveness in real-world setting, a study 
protocol has been agreed by CHMP (EMEA/H/C/0005675/MEA/010.1) 
Data on concomitant administration of Vaxzevria with other vaccines has not been submitted by the 
MAH. 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety database includes over 33,000 participants aged ≥18 years who received AZD1222 (12,000 
approx. from pooled safety dataset and 21,000 approx. from study D8110C00001). Reactogenicity 
data was collected in a subset of 4,762 participants receiving AZD1222. Additionally, cumulatively, 
from the 29 December 2020 (international birth date, IBD) to the 31 May 2021 DLP, patient exposure 
by ADZ1222 doses distributed was estimated at over 500 million doses in over 70 countries.  
Data from clinical studies  
Data reported by clinical trial, showed that the frequencies of any solicited local and systemic AEs were 
reported more frequently in AZD1222 than in the control or placebo group. Most of the local and 
systemic AEs following AZD1222 were mild or moderate and self-limiting. The most frequently reported 
solicited adverse events (within 7 day after any vaccination) are injection site tenderness (68%), 
injection site pain (58%), headache (53%), fatigue (53%), myalgia (44%), malaise (44%), pyrexia 
(includes feverishness (33%) and fever ≥38°C (8%), chills (32%), arthralgia (27%) and nausea 
(22%).  
Unsolicited AEs reported (within 28 days after any vaccination) were largely consistent with AEs 
observed following vaccination and the majority was mild to moderate in severity.  A reduction of the 
percentages of AEs was shown after the second dose in both the study vaccine and the comparator.  
Overall incidence of AESIs was low in the University of Oxford (COV) studies and in study 
D8110C00001. Noticeably, AESI were reported more frequently in study D8110C00001 (2.4% in 
AD1222) than in the University of Oxford pooled trials (0.9% in AZD1222 group). This increase in 
frequency of AESI is mainly due to the fact that in D8110C00001 trial vaccine-associated enhanced 
respiratory disease (VAERD) cases, that were the most frequently reported AESI, were included in the 
AESI category. In this study all COVID-19 cases were categorized under VAERD and included as AESIs. 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs in pooled studies (SOB 019) and in study D8110C00001 (SOB020) was 
low and similar in the AZD1222 and control or placebo groups. Fewer than 1% of participants reported 
a SAE overall (any dose). Both in the University of Oxford studies and in study D8110C00001, the 
most frequently reported SAEs by system organic class (SOC) in the AZD1222 and groups were 
Infections and Infestations, and the most frequently reported preferred term (PT) was Appendicitis. 
Only ≤0,1% participants reported a SAE considered treatment-related by the investigator, 2 in the 
AZD1222 group (pyrexia, myelitis transverse) and 2 in the control group (autoimmune haemolytic

anaemia and myelitis) in the Oxford pooled studies and 1 subject in the AZD1222 (hypoaesthesia and 
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy) group and 2 in the placebo group in study 
D8110C00001 (optic ischaemic neuropathy and neurosensory hypoacusia). Except pyrexia all other 
SAEs were AESIs. 
In  the  D8110C00001  study  5  events  of  facial  paralysis  (AESI)  were  reported  in  the  AZD1222  group 
versus 0 in the placebo group (the imbalance was also seen in the pooled studies, although it was less 
pronounced).  
No anaphylactic reactions were reported in the clinical trial. Nonetheless, anaphylaxis and angioedema 
were  included  as  adverse  reactions  from  post-marketing  data  based  on  a  safety  signal  of  serious 
hypersensitivity/ anaphylactic reaction (see section on post-marketing data). 
Post-marketing data 
During the reporting period, PRAC regularly assessed monthly safety information through monthly 
summary safety repots (MSSRs). Those assessments, along with EPITT (European Pharmacovigilance 
Issues Tracking Tool) notifications, led to the identification of several safety signals which themselves 
led to updates of Vaxzevria Product Information and RMP. The PRAC considers that the Benefit-risks 
balance of Vaxzevria remains positive. This recommendation is issued before the first PSUR for 
Vaxzevria is assessed and following conclusion of the article 5.3 review which was under assessment at 
the time of the DLP. Vaxzevria should continue to be closely monitored for safety.   
a)  Safety signals identified during the reporting period:  
Thrombotic events with thrombocytopenia 
•  Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis  
• 
• 
Thrombocytopenia 
•  Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
•  Capillary leak syndrome 
• 
Immune thrombocytopenia 
In addition:  
Thrombosis has been included in RMP as important potential risk.  
• 
•  Acute Macular Outer Retinopathy was identified as a safety signal in May and confirmed in June 
(after the DLP) 
b)  Analysis of data under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004:  
On 9 April 2021, the European Commission Health and Food Safety requested to EMA further analysis 
on thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS)  and Vaxzevria in order to better characterise risk factors 
and “in order to provide more specific recommendations to the Member States to guide their 
vaccination programme”. The Agency was also requested “to provide, if possible, a recommendation on 
the administration of the second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine”. 
On 14th September 2021, the CHMP concluded that “With regards to a possible recommendation on the 
administration of the second dose, the CHMP considered available data on the occurrence of TTS 
following the second dose as well as safety and efficacy aspects of different scenarios surrounding the 
second dose.  
The CHMP concluded that two separate doses of Vaxzevria should be administered 4 to 12 weeks 
apart, in line with the current product information. The mechanism behind the observed cases of TTS 
remains unclear, and whilst spontaneous reporting suggests that the risk following the second dose 
may be lower than the risk observed following the first dose, no firm conclusion should be drawn.”

Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety data is not yet available. Participants in the pooled clinical trials have had a median 
follow-up of >2 months after the second dose and the participants in study D8110C00001 had a 
median number of follow-up days of 92 days after first dose and 61 days after second dose. 
Some serious adverse events with a neuro-inflammatory aetiology have been observed in the safety 
database for which relatedness to the study treatment cannot be excluded at this stage (see section 
3.5). Regular updates are needed to inform of any new events in the SOC of Nervous System disorders 
or any serious or severe events with a neuro-inflammatory aetiology. Therefore, these have been 
identified as a potential important risk in the RMP with adequate surveillance measures. 
Safety data in participants with severe immunodeficiency, or participants with severe underlying 
disease (including autoimmune or inflammatory disorders) are lacking, as all these populations were 
excluded from the studies. The MAH has submitted a safety study protocol in immunocompromised 
adults ≥18 years which was agreed at CHMP (MEA 009.1). The results are pending, the primary clinical 
study should be submitted in February 2023 and the final CSR in November 2023. 
Over a third of participants in the University of Oxford studies and in study D8110C00001 had 
comorbidity at baseline. There were no imbalances in the unsolicited AEs, SAEs and AESIs between the 
AZD1222 and control group for either comorbidity subgroup and between individual comorbidity 
subgroups. 
Further, there is only very limited clinical experience in pregnant women, with 14 pregnant women in 
the safety database who were exposed to AZD1222. Data from non-clinical studies do not indicate any 
harm during pregnancy. In the absence of clinical data to confirm lack of risks, risks during pregnancy 
remain, albeit theoretical. The MAH has presented a protocol for a pregnancy register of women 
exposed to AZD1222 (MEA 006.1).   
The available data (non-clinical, clinical, neutralizing capacity of antibodies) from clinical trials and 
post-marketing exposure do not raise a concern regarding vaccine-associated -enhanced disease. 
However, the possibility of enhanced disease cannot be excluded with certainty. Vaccine-associated 
enhanced disease (VAED) should continue to be considered as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
The available clinical data for Vaxzevria, including the induction of immune responses and the 
demonstrated vaccine efficacy, establish the benefits to prevent COVID-19 in immunized individuals 18 
years of age and older. The available safety data for subjects aged 18 years and above allows 
concluding on a positive benefit/risk balance in the proposed indication. The quality related SOBs are 
ongoing according to plan and expected to be concluded by February 2021. The fulfilment of the 
clinical SOBs are due on 31 May 2022 and 31 March 2024. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Not applicable 
Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the cumulative evidence in terms of favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk 
balance of Vaxzevria remains positive.

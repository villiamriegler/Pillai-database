The pharmacodynamic effect of Oncaspar was assessed 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 
4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC based on the final 
results from studies DFCI 11-001 and AALL07P4 
listed as category 3 studies in the Risk Management 
Plan: Study DFCI 11-001 is a Phase 2, open-label, 
randomized, multicenter study to determine the 
safety and feasibility of administering an 
investigational asparaginase product (asparaginase 
formulation) compared with Oncaspar in subjects 
aged 1 to <22 years with newly diagnosed Acute 
after IM (Study CCG 1962) and IV administration 
(AALL07P4). Based on results from these two studies, a 
2,500 U/m2 BSA dose of Oncaspar administered IM (CCG 
1962) and IV (AALL07P4) provides maintenance of L 
asparagine depletion for approximately two weeks following 
dosing. The results on pharmacokinetic properties were 
reflected in section 5.2. Overall, results indicate that, when 
Oncaspar 2,500 U/m2 BSA is administered as single and 
repeated doses every two weeks, clinically relevant 
asparaginase activity is sustained over the entire dosing 
interval (i.e. two weeks). Results from Study CCG-1962

Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic

Study AALL07P4 is a multicenter, open label, 
randomized, active-controlled, parallel design clinical 
pilot study conducted to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, 
immunogenicity and efficacy of an investigational 
asparaginase product  in comparison with Oncaspar 
in patients aged 1 to <31 years newly diagnosed 
with high risk B-precursor ALL. The Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

controlled studies were not designed to formally evaluate 
the pharmacokinetics of Oncaspar in specific populations. A 
population pharmacokinetic evaluation of Oncaspar based 
on data obtained from Studies AALL07P4 (IV), DFCI 11 001 
(IV), and CCG 1962 (IM) identified that clearance (linear 
and saturable) increased approximately proportional to BSA 
and volume of distribution increased slightly more 
proportional to BSA. No statistically significant differences 
in PK characteristics between male and female subjects 
were identified in this analysis. The impact of renal and 
hepatic impairment on the PK of Oncaspar has not been 
evaluated. 
The existing warning concerning hepatitis and pancreatitis 
was reworded, and monitoring of serum amylase and/or 
lipase levels was added to be monitored frequently to 
identify early signs of pancreatic inflammation. As impaired 
glucose tolerance may occur with concomitant use of 
Oncaspar with prednisone, blood glucose levels should be 
monitored. The existing contraindication in patients with 
history of pancreatitis has been updated to include 
pancreatitis related to previous L asparaginase therapy. 
New adverse reactions have been reported from these 
studies, namely increase of aspartate aminotransferase and 
lipase levels, embolism, ascites, hypoalbuminaemia, 
hypokalaemia, increase of international normalized ratio. 
Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, lip 
swelling, eye swelling, erythema, decreased blood 
pressure, bronchospasm, dyspnoea and pruritus were 
observed in these studies and further described in the 
SmPC .  
Warning was reworded in order to specify that patients with 
Page 13/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
known hypersensitivity to E. coli derived asparaginase 
formulations should be aware of possible hypersensitivity 
reactions, whereas Philadelphia chromosome positive 
patients for whom treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(e.g. imatinib) is combined with L asparaginase may be at 
increased risk for hepatotoxicity. 
Combination therapy with Oncaspar and hepatotoxic 
products can result in severe hepatic toxicity and those 
patients should be monitored for changes in liver function 
parameters. Due to the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia, it is 
recommended to monitor bilirubin levels at baseline and 
prior to each dose, whereas ammonia levels should be 
monitored closely in case of hyperammonaemia symptoms 
(nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness and rash). 
Warning was reviewed to clearly indicate that Oncaspar 
may also cause myelosuppression and therefore increase 
the risk of infections. 
It is strongly recommended that every time Oncaspar is 
administered to a patient, the name and lot number of the 
product are recorded in order to link the patient and the lot 
of the product and thereby closely monitor patients for any 
adverse reactions throughout the administration period.

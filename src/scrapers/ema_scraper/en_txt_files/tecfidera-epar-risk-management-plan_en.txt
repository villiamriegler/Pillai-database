Information (PI) 
Indication(s) in the EEA 
Chemical class: Fumarate ester drug product containing the active 
ingredient DMF. 
Mode of action: The nonclinical pharmacology studies conducted suggest 
that BG00012 elicits both direct neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory 
activities via its action on the Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway. In 
preclinical studies, BG00012 significantly reduced macrophage activation 
and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to 
inflammatory stimuli and demonstrated therapeutic activity in multiple 
models of in vivo inflammatory injury models. 
In addition, BG00012 was shown to significantly improve cell viability 
after oxidative challenge in primary cultures of astrocytes and neurons, 
suggesting BG00012 directly prevented neurodegeneration in response to 
toxic oxidative stress. The use of in vivo acute neurotoxic injury models or 
genetic models of neurodegenerative disease confirmed that BG00012 
provided therapeutic benefit in reducing neuronal damage resulting from 
various types of toxic stimuli. Evidence of the role of Nrf2 in mediating 
BG00012 effects was gleaned from models of Nrf2 deficiency. In these 
studies, the beneficial effects of BG00012 were abrogated in the absence of 
Nrf2.

PART II:  SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
PART II: MODULE SI - EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND 
TARGET POPULATION(S) 
Incidence and Prevalence 
Despite a wealth of published epidemiological data describing the incidence and prevalence of 
MS across Europe, varying diagnostic criteria and survey methods make it difficult to derive an 
accurate overall estimate. The total number of people living with MS worldwide is 
approximately 2.2 million. The disease is unevenly distributed throughout the world, with 
age-standardised prevalence varying between < 60 per 100,000 in Asia and Latin America to 
> 120 cases per 100,000 in North America and some northern European countries [Collaborators 
GBDMS 2019]. 
A systematic review of studies of the incidence and prevalence of MS in Europe discovered 
significant heterogeneity in incidence rate and prevalence estimates between and within regions 
as well as across time (e.g., increasing incidence in more recent years). Some of the observed 
heterogeneity in more recent years could be explained by advances in methodology and study 
design, but increasing latitude was also a potential explanation for regional variance. The 
prevalence and incidence estimates tended to be higher in the northern regions of the United 
Kingdom and in the Nordic countries, implicating the role of latitude and the more recent studies 
(after the year 2000) reported higher MS prevalence and incidence estimates. In summary, 
estimated incidence rates across Europe and over time ranged widely, from < 1 per 100,000 to 
> 10 per 100,000 [Kingwell 2013]. 
In 2016, the overall prevalence in Europe was estimated to vary between 78,500 and 543,860 
individuals [Collaborators GBDMS 2019]. 
Demographics of the target population in the authorised indication 
MS is approximately twice as common in women as men and predominantly affects adults aged 
20 to 60 years. The frequency of paediatric MS is approximately 2% to 5% [Atzori 2009; Chitnis 
2009; Confavreux and Vukusic 2008; Ferreira 2008; Pohl 2007; Broland Steinborn 2020]; 
another analysis suggests that 2% to 10% of all patients with MS are diagnosed before their 16th 
birthday [Annes 2002; Ness 2007]. Aggregate data from the European Database for Multiple 
Sclerosis network reported a mean and median age of onset for a paediatric patient of 13.7 and 
14.5 years, respectively [Renoux 2007]. Only 1% to 2% of cases occur in children younger than 
10 years of age and < 0.2% before the age of 6 years [Alonso and Hernán 2008; Cole 1995; 
Deryck 2006; Ghezzi 1997; Ghezzi 2002; Pohl 2007; Simone 2002; Sindern 1992; Stark 2008]. 
Risk factors for the disease  
MS is an inflammatory disease of the brain and spinal cord characterised by focal areas of 
inflammation that lead to destruction of the myelin sheath and varying degrees of axonal injury. 
While researchers do not know the exact causes of the disease, both genetic (e.g., family history 
Page 12 of 79 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
of disease) and environmental (e.g., smoking, Epstein-Barr virus, latitude) risk factors are 
suspected aetiologies of the disease [Ramagopalan 2010]. 
Existing treatment options  
Current therapies for MS generally fall within the following categories: treatment for acute 
relapses, symptomatic therapies, and DMTs. Currently available DMTs include IFN β 
(Betaferon®, Avonex®, Rebif®, Extavia®), pegylated IFN (Plegridy®), GA (Copaxone®), 
fingolimod (Gilenya®), siponimod (Mayzent®), ozanimod (Zeposia®), teriflunomide (Aubagio®), 
DMF (Tecfidera®), alemtuzumab (Lemtrada®), natalizumab (Tysabri®), ocrelizumab (Ocrevus®), 
mitoxantrone (Novantrone®), ofatumumab (Kesimpta®), and cladribine (Mavenclad®). In 
addition, several antineoplastic and immunosuppressant agents, including cyclophosphamide, 
methotrexate, and azathioprine, are sometimes used in the treatment of MS.  
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity 
Mortality in target indication: Average survival following diagnosis of MS is estimated to be 29 
to 30 years. 
The first clinical manifestations of MS often take the form of CIS affecting the optic nerve (optic 
neuritis), spinal cord (transverse myelitis), or brainstem/cerebellum. Estimates of the number of 
patients who eventually go on to develop MS vary widely, but in the case of optic neuritis, the 
presence of clinically silent brain lesions on MRI at the time of the attack indicates a greater than 
80% chance of developing clinically definite MS within 10 years. Approximately 90% of 
individuals develop RRMS, which is characterised by episodic bouts of neurological worsening 
(relapses), separated by periods of relative stability (remissions). The population of patients with 
RRMS ranges from those with relatively “benign” inactive, noninflammatory disease to patients 
who experience frequent relapses and/or persistent active inflammatory disease on brain MRI.  
Over a period of approximately 25 years, about 70% of individuals with RRMS will eventually 
enter a phase of progressive neurological decline, with or without superimposed relapses, known 
as SPMS. In addition, approximately 10% of patients with MS will have progression from the 
onset of the disease (PPMS), typically without acute relapses.  
Approximately 50% of patients with MS will require assistance with walking within 15 years of 
their diagnosis. In addition, MS can have a substantial adverse impact on cognitive function, 
quality of life, productivity, and employment, and is a leading cause of disability in young adults.  
Based on analyses conducted by Decision Resources, in Europe as of 2014, there were 
approximately 228,000 diagnosed MS patients with RRMS who are being treated with 
pharmacological therapy [Crowley 2015]. This represents 67% of the total diagnosed population 
in Europe (N = 340,000). However, despite the demonstrated efficacy of MS treatments and their 
widespread use, there is a substantial population of patients with relapsing MS who remain 
untreated for their disease. Many of these patients have disease with relatively little evidence of 
active inflammation clinically (relapses) or by MRI and hence choose not to initiate treatment.  
Children with MS generally experience a more aggressive disease onset and increased cognitive 
impairment compared to adults [Alroughani and Boyko 2018]. Of paediatric MS patients, 98% 
present with a relapsing-remitting course, with a higher relapse frequency than adult-onset MS 
Page 13 of 79 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
(2 to 3 times more frequent relapses) [Alroughani and Boyko 2018; Pena and Lotze 2013]. 
Children tend to recover from relapses more quickly than adults, on average over 4 weeks 
compared with 6 to 8 weeks in adults [Chitnis 2013]. MS disease progression, including physical 
disability, is slower in children. Paediatric MS eventually progresses from RRMS to secondary 
progressive MS 10 years later than adult-onset MS [Alroughani and Boyko 2018; Renoux 2007; 
Wright 2017]. However, while there is less likelihood of secondary progression of MS in 
childhood, by age 35 years, half of the childhood-onset MS populations show secondary 
progression. Treatment in children should be started early in the disease course to reduce relapse 
rate and disease progression and improve long-term outlook [Alroughani 2021; Krysko 2020]. 
Important co-morbidities found in the target population  
Pulmonary morbidity has been described in MS, especially among patients with more severe 
disease. The incidence of pneumonia is estimated to be twice that of the general population. 
Respiratory muscle function is affected by disease severity [Gosselink 1999]. Respiratory illness 
is also a common cause of death among patients with MS. A study of the Danish Multiple 
Sclerosis Registry (1998) found that MS patients were more likely to die from respiratory and 
infectious diseases than the general population [Koch-Henriksen 1998]. MS patients appear to 
have an increased history of respiratory tract infections prior to the onset of illness [Marrie 
2000]. Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that the background incidence of pneumonias and 
respiratory tract infections in MS patients are likely to be higher than in the general population. 
A crude estimate, based on the MS Danish registry results, suggests that the infection rate in MS 
patients may be at least two times greater than the general population. Using information from 
the US NHANES study 1988-1994, it was found that 2.3% of the total population or 5.6 million 
people reported suffering from some type of pneumonia in the 12 months prior to the survey 
[Prevention 2012]. A much lower pneumonia hospitalisation rate, which indicates that most 
pneumonia is treated in an outpatient setting, has been estimated in the US using the 1981 
National Health Survey. This survey reported an annual hospitalisation rate of 3.4/1000, or over 
530,000 hospital admissions for pneumonia – almost 60% were in patients more than 65 years 
old. At this time, no estimates of pneumonia incidence rates within MS patients were found. 
Urinary symptoms are very common in patients with MS. One in 10 patients may already have 
urinary symptoms at the time of initial diagnosis of MS. However, on average, symptoms will 
appear about 6 years after the onset of disease [de Seze 2007] and are estimated to be present in 
64% to 68% of patients with MS. Symptoms include frequency, urgency, and urinary 
incontinence, which together are described as overactive bladder syndrome. Urinary tract 
infections are common in patients with MS and are likely to be present in 30% of MS patients. 
The incidence of urinary symptoms increases with disease duration. Treatment options for 
overactive bladder include anticholinergic agents, but none of the newer drugs in this class, 
which are also likely to be better tolerated, have been specifically studied in patients with MS 
[Nicholas 2009]. Infection needs to be excluded in any patients presenting with urinary 
symptoms. 
An estimated 50% of MS patients visiting an outpatient department are likely to be experiencing 
pain, which can be directly or indirectly related to MS or MS treatments or may be coincidental. 
Depression has been described as a symptom of patients with MS with a lifetime risk of about 
50% [Sadovnick 1996] and appears to occur more frequently in patients with MS than in other

PART II: MODULE SIV - POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS 
SIV.1  Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development 
programme 
The Tecfidera clinical development programme has employed specific exclusion criteria that 
were related to the evaluation of efficacy (to ensure that the appropriate target disease was 
studied, or to avoid confounding the efficacy evaluation), to safety (in order to protect trial 
patients from potential risks associated with investigational product administration), or to GCP 
(e.g., to ensure that proper follow-up was possible). 
When evaluating the impact of these exclusion criteria in relation to the impact on the safety of 
patients receiving treatment with Tecfidera in the postmarketing setting, key exclusion criteria 
pertaining to safety from pivotal studies included in the primary pooled safety dataset are 
addressed by the ‘Contraindications’ and ‘Special warnings and precautions for use’ sections of 
the Tecfidera SmPC.  
Exclusion criteria from these pivotal studies that are considered as contraindications in the 
SmPC, and their rationale for not being considered as missing information, are discussed in 
Table 9.

Rationale  
The current SmPC contraindicates the use of 
Tecfidera in patients with hypersensitivity to 
the active substance or to any of the excipients 
(as listed in SmPC Section 6.1).  
Considering this contraindication, use in this 
patient population is not considered to be 
relevant for inclusion as missing information.  
A review of the key exclusion criteria in the pivotal studies that do not remain as 
contraindications for use and the appropriate justifications in relation to their relevance to be 
considered as missing information are presented in Table 10.

Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission 
Not applicable, as this EU RMP update is not an initial submission. 
SVII.2  New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an 
updated RMP 
SVII.2.1  Newly identified safety concerns 
No new safety concerns have been identified since the previous version of this EU RMP 
(Version 15.0, approved 28 Nov 2022) was submitted. 
SVII.2.2  Reclassification of existing safety concerns 
Not applicable, no existing safety concerns were reclassified. 
SVII.3  Details of important identified risks, important potential risks, and 
missing information 
Data from completed paediatric studies have revealed that the safety profile in paediatric patients 
(those aged 10 years to < 18 years) show no meaningful differences compared with the safety 
profile in adults. No safety concerns related solely to paediatric patients were identified. 
SVII.3.1  Presentation of important identified risks 
SVII.3.1.1   Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)  
Relevant MedDRA term: PT Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  
Potential mechanisms 
PML is an opportunistic infection caused by the JCV. However, even in patients who are 
anti-JCV antibody positive, PML only occurs in minority of patients because JCV infection is 
only one of several factors required for the development of PML.  
Published studies have proposed several hypotheses for the reactivation of JCV and the 
development of PML. These hypotheses, as well as their relevance for Tecfidera treatment are 
discussed below: 
• 
Potential immunosuppression by reducing the binding of mononuclear cells to vascular 
cell adhesion molecule-1 thus allowing the proliferation of JCV which is undetectable to 
the immune system [Khatri 2015]. In preclinical and clinical studies, after oral 
administration of DMF only the primary metabolite MMF can be detected in circulation 
due to the rapid and extensive pre-systemic metabolism of DMF. MMF, even at very high 
concentrations (200 µM, which is 100-fold higher than the human MMF maximum 
observed concentration after 240 mg DMF) had no effects on adhesion molecule 
expression [Wallbrecht 2011].

• 
Host genetic factors with regard to HLA class I and II genes where different variants may 
influence the effectiveness of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune defence, have been 
investigated [Sundqvist 2014]. However, the methodology used in this study had several 
shortcomings: (i) the identified HLA associations were compared to JCV-seropositive 
status, and no JCV-specific T-cell responses were measured; (ii) the HLA alleles 
identified in this study are not biomarkers for anti-JCV antibody or T cell responses, 
since these HLA alleles can be found in both JCV-seropositive and JCV seronegative 
individuals; and (iii) genotype discordance between different platforms were observed. 
Finally, these results have not been replicated using a uniform genotyping platform.   
Mechanisms of cellular immunity such as IFN-γ producing CD4+ T cells and 
JCV-specific CD8+ cells are considered critical in preventing PML development 
[Calabrese 2015]. Specifically, IFN secretion by JCV specific CD8+ T-cells is known to 
be important in PML survival [Gheuens 2011], and IL-2 has been given to boost the 
immune system as a potential treatment for PML [Gheuens 2013]. A publication by de 
Jong describes T-cell cytokine influence mediated by MMF in purified human T cells [de 
Jong 1996]. Since the in vitro effect of T-cell cytokine switching was only seen at 
200 μM MMF and above, it is important to note that 200 μM MMF is 2- to 6-fold and 
139-fold greater than the maximal serum concentration of MMF in humans following 
recommended Fumaderm and Tecfidera administration, respectively. Therefore, it is 
unlikely that DMF or MMF would impact human T cells in the in vivo setting of standard 
fumaric acid ester exposure similar to the described in vitro effects characterised in the de 
Jong paper. 
Investigations on the potential role of JCV-specific CD8+ T [Chen 2009; Marzocchetti 
2009] have resulted in variable results. A report by Gheuens et al. 2011 notes that “a 
major limitation in the study of the cellular immune response to JCV is the very low 
frequency of specific T cells and the difficulty in detecting them in peripheral blood ex 
vivo” and that despite these cells being present after PML diagnosis, it was unclear 
whether they were present prior to PML. 
Current evidence suggests that the mechanism of action of Tecfidera (as DMF) involves at least 
2 pathways; activation of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway [Linker 
2011; Scannevin 2012] and activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor hydroxycarboxylic acid 
receptor 2 (HCA2) [Chen 2014]. These mechanisms are consistent with preclinical and clinical 
evidence supporting immunomodulatory and cytoprotective effects from DMF treatment. There 
is nothing in the preclinical or clinical literature that suggests either of these mechanisms would 
confer increased risk for PML. There have been no associations of Nrf2 gain of function genetic 
polymorphisms with PML, nor have other structurally diverse small molecule activators of Nrf2 
been associated with PML [de Zeeuw 2013].  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
PML case definitions (which categorise cases into Level 1 to Level 5) allow classification of 
cases based on various levels of diagnostic certainty, ranging from the highest to lowest. It 
outlines specific criteria for ruled-out (Level 5) as well as high and low suspect cases 
(Levels 2 and 3, respectively) and includes a category for cases with insufficient data despite 
exhaustive due diligence (Level 4).

Following this adjudication process, confirmed PML cases (Level 1) have been identified in 
association with Tecfidera use (and other products containing fumarates) in the setting of 
lymphopenia. PML is a contraindication in Section 4.3 (Contraindications) and an ADR in 
Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the Tecfidera SmPC, and wording relating to the detection 
and management of PML is included in Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use).

This risk is characterised in Table 15.

Placebo-controlled clinical trials: No case of PML was identified 
in placebo-controlled clinical trials.

PML was observed in the setting of severe and prolonged 
lymphopenia in a participant in the study. 
Postmarketing spontaneous 
•  Cases of PML have been reported during postmarketing use in the 
setting of lymphopenia.  
Seriousness and severity 
All confirmed cases of PML were serious. PML can be fatal or result in 
severe disability.  
Reversibility and long-term 
outcomes 
All confirmed cases following Tecfidera exposure occurred in the 
setting of lymphopenia. PML can be fatal or result in severe disability. 
Impact on quality of life  
PML is fatal in approximately 20% of cases; however, there are limited 
data on the quality of life for the 80% of patients who survive.  
PML, like MS, is a demyelinating disease, and therefore symptoms can 
vary in severity and may be similar to an MS relapse. Typical 
symptoms associated with PML can vary in severity, are diverse, and 
progress over days to weeks. They can include: 
•  Progressive weakness or clumsiness of limbs 
•  Sensory disturbances 
•  Personality changes or cognitive deficits 
•  Trouble speaking 
•  Visual disturbances 
•  Loss of balance  
In some cases, the damage caused by PML can be extensive and can 
lead to fatality or extreme disability; however, in rare cases, the 
infection can be asymptomatic.  
Consequently, the impact on quality of life in the individual patient is 
difficult to assess outside of a case-by-case basis.

Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
Risk factors and risk groups 
PML can only occur in the presence of a JCV infection, with studies indicating that 
approximately 60% - 70% of MS patients were seropositive when screened for anti-JCV 
antibody [Olsson 2013]. Whilst patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive are at greater risk 
for developing PML than the overall population of MS patients, patients who are anti-JCV 
antibody negative may still be at risk of PML for reasons such as a new JCV infection, 
fluctuating antibody status or a false negative test result. 
There are several well-recognised risk factors for PML such as immunosuppression, use of 
natalizumab, and a decrease in lymphocyte count. Furthermore, there are populations that have a 
higher risk of developing PML, including HIV patients; patients with malignancies, including 
NHL and CLL; patients diagnosed with SLE, sarcoidosis and autoimmune vasculitis; and 
patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.  
Although several hypothetical risk factors have been proposed as biomarkers to stratify PML 
risk, nothing has been validated to date that is not drug specific. Furthermore, even among 
natalizumab-treated patients, for whom there exists a well-validated PML risk algorithm, no 
additional JCV-specific or host-specific biomarker has been identified through exhaustive 
analysis of relevant information from risk characterisation (detection of mutant pathogenic JCV 
DNA in serum, host genetic marker, CSF IgM oligoclonal bands, serum protein signature, and 
CD62L/L-selectin) for development of PML in these individuals. 
With regard to Tecfidera, the findings common to all confirmed cases of PML reported to date 
have been the presence of lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts < 0.91 × 109/L), with the majority of 
confirmed cases of PML occurring in the setting of moderate to severe lymphopenia for longer 
than 6 months’ duration. Therefore, it is considered that in Tecfidera-treated patients, 
lymphopenia is a risk factor.  
Information from studies evaluating lymphopenia associated with Tecfidera treatment have 
shown that ALC was highly correlated with total T, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, highlighting the 
effectiveness of the regular monitoring of lymphocyte counts in identifying patients at risk of 
developing lymphopenia.  
Additional factors that might contribute to an increased risk for PML in the setting of 
lymphopenia are duration of Tecfidera therapy (cases of PML have occurred after 
approximately1 to 5 years of treatment, although the exact relationship with duration of 
treatment is unknown); profound decreases in CD4+ and especially in CD8+ T cell counts, 
which are important for immunological defence; and prior immunosuppressive or 
immunomodulatory therapy.  
Additionally, the majority of PML cases in the postmarketing setting have occurred in patients 
> 50 years of age. 
Preventability 
In Tecfidera-treated patients, lymphopenia is considered a risk factor for the development of 
PML; therefore, regular monitoring of lymphocyte counts provides an effective preventability 
measure to identify patients at risk. 
Page 37 of 79 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
Prior to initiating treatment with Tecfidera, a current complete blood count, including 
lymphocytes, must be performed. If lymphocyte count is found to be below the normal range, 
thorough assessment of possible causes should be completed prior to initiation of treatment with 
Tecfidera. Before initiating treatment with Tecfidera, a baseline MRI should also be available 
(usually within 3 months) as a reference. 
After starting therapy, complete blood counts, including lymphocytes, must be performed every 
3 months. Discontinue Tecfidera in patients with lymphocyte counts < 0.5 × 109/L persisting for 
more than 6 months. Reassess the risk-benefit in patients who experience moderate lymphopenia 
for more than 6 months. Lymphocyte counts should be followed until recovery (see Table 16 
under Reversibility and Long-Term Outcomes). Additional factors that might further augment 
the individual PML risk should be considered. 
At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, treatment with Tecfidera should be withheld 
and appropriate diagnostic evaluations performed. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product 
PML continues to be a rare event related to Tecfidera use, and all reports of suspected PML are 
closely monitored and subject to rigorous follow-up to accurately adjudicate the cases according 
to level of evidence and to characterise any potential additional risk factors for PML. In addition, 
the MAH conducted research to characterise the impact of Tecfidera on lymphocytes. Tecfidera 
treatment is associated with primarily a decline in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, and it was shown 
that ALC was highly correlated with total T, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.  
The Tecfidera SmPC describes the risk of lymphopenia and PML in Section 4.4 (Special 
warnings and Precautions for use), as monitoring of lymphocyte counts provides a means for 
early identification of those patients who are at increased risk for developing lymphopenia and 
its potential sequelae. These recommendations in the label are considered to be adequate 
measures to mitigate the risk of PML, and therefore the risk-benefit balance of the product 
remains favourable.  
Public health impact 
PML is not considered to have a major impact on public health. 
SVII.3.1.2   Decreases in leucocyte and lymphocyte count  
Relevant MedDRA terms: PTs Leukopenia, Lymphopenia, White blood cell count decreased, 
Lymphocyte count decreased 
Potential mechanisms 
The mechanism is unknown. DMF did not have effects on lymphocytes in repeat dose and 
chronic studies in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. There were no direct effects of DMF on 
immune system organs and tissues in any of the species tested.

Version: 16.0 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
In placebo-controlled studies, most patients (> 98%) had normal lymphocyte values prior to 
initiating treatment. Upon treatment with Tecfidera, mean lymphocyte counts decreased over the 
first year with a subsequent plateau. On average, lymphocyte counts decreased by approximately 
30% of baseline value. Overall, mean and median lymphocyte counts remained within normal 
limits; however, lymphocyte counts of < 0.5 × 109/L were observed in < 1% of patients treated 
with placebo and 6% of patients treated with Tecfidera. 
Consequently, leukopenia and lymphopenia were added as ADRs in Section 4.8 (Undesirable 
effects) of the Tecfidera SmPC, and requirements for regular monitoring of complete blood cell 
counts, including lymphocytes, was included in Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions 
for use). 
Characterisation of the risk 
This risk is characterised in Table 16.

Incidence in placebo: 1.20% (95% CI 0.58%, 2.20%) 
Incidence in Tecfidera BID: 7.13% (95% CI 5.40%, 9.21%) 
Incidence in Tecfidera TID: 5.22% (95% CI 3.79%, 6.99%)

Incidence in Tecfidera TID: 2.98% (95% CI 1.92%, 4.40%) 
(Clopper Pearson exact confidence interval was used to calculate the 
95% confidence intervals of these laboratory values.) 
Analysis of laboratory data in patients treated with Tecfidera showed 
decreases in mean WBC counts by approximately 10% and lymphocyte 
counts by about 30%. The decreases in WBC counts were 
predominantly due to decreases in lymphocyte counts. Mean and 
median WBC and lymphocyte counts remained within normal limits. 
The incidence of patients with a lymphocyte value less than 0.5 × 109/L 
at any time was 6% for Tecfidera BID and 3% for Tecfidera TID 
compared to < 1% for placebo.  
Combined analysis of controlled and uncontrolled trials  
Integrated data analysis of clinical studies showed that 9% of patients 
experienced moderate lymphopenia with absolute lymphocyte counts 
≥ 0.5 × 109/L and < 0.8 × 109/L for at least 6 months. Two percent of 
participants experienced severe lymphopenia with ALC counts < 0.5 × 
109/L persisting for at least 6 months, which is an early predictor for 
the development of severe prolonged lymphopenia. In this group, the

Impact on quality of life  
majority of lymphocyte counts remained < 0.5 × 109/L with continued 
therapy. 
In placebo-controlled studies, there were no serious infections reported 
in patients with a minimum post baseline WBC count < 3.0 × 109/L or 
a lymphocyte count < 0.5 × 109/L.  
In controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, participants with 
lymphopenia who discontinued Tecfidera were monitored until their 
lymphocyte counts returned to normal. Refer to Section 5.1 
(Pharmacodynamic properties) of the SmPC for data on lymphocyte 
recovery. 
Leukopenia and lymphopenia are asymptomatic conditions, and their 
occurrence does not impact the quality of life of an individual patient 
per se.  
If particularly prolonged, leukopenia and lymphopenia can be 
associated with an increased risk of serious infections, including 
opportunistic infections, as adverse clinical outcomes; however, as 
there is no evidence of overall increased risk of serious or opportunistic 
infections (other than PML and herpes zoster) in Tecfidera-treated 
patients, decreases in leucocyte or lymphocyte counts do not impact 
quality of life in the majority of patients. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Analyses of clinical trial data suggest that patients at risk for developing severe, prolonged 
lymphopenia can be identified early in a subset of participants presenting with consecutive 
lymphocyte counts < 500/mm3 for more than 6 months (approximately 2% of the trial 
population). The majority of participants in this subpopulation who are at risk for developing 
severe, prolonged lymphopenia tended to present early with lymphocyte counts < 0.5 × 109/L, 
specifically, within the first 6 to 12 months of Tecfidera treatment. 
Preventability 
Routine monitoring of CBC and differential (see also risk minimisation measures) may serve to 
mitigate the risk through early detection of events of lymphopenia and identify patients at risk of 
developing lymphopenia. 
Tecfidera should be discontinued in patients with lymphocyte counts < 0.5 × 109/L persisting for 
more than 6 months. Lymphocyte counts should be followed until recovery (see Table 16 under 
Reversibility and Long-Term Outcomes). Upon recovery and in the absence of alternative 
treatment options, decisions about whether or not to restart Tecfidera after treatment 
discontinuation should be based on clinical judgement. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product 
Decreases in lymphocyte count in isolation do not constitute a risk to Tecfidera-treated patients; 
however, lymphopenia may increase the risk of serious infections, including opportunistic 
infections. Lymphopenia is an established risk factor for PML in Tecfidera-treated patients; 
however, PML continues to be a rare event related to Tecfidera use.

Public health impact 
Decreases in lymphocyte and leucocyte counts do not impact public health.  
Potential complications associated with lymphopenia are unlikely to have an impact on public 
health because they are rare and can be mitigated with regular monitoring. 
SVII.3.1.3   Drug-induced liver injury 
Relevant MedDRA terms: SMQ Hepatic failure, fibrosis and cirrhosis and other liver 
damage-related conditions; SMQ Hepatitis, non-infectious. 
Potential mechanisms 
In general, the clinical presentation of DILI takes one of three presentations: 
•  hepatocellular injury (hepatitis; disproportionate elevation in aminotransferases [> 2 × ULN] 
compared to ALP and elevation in bilirubin) 
cholestatic injury (cholestasis; disproportionate elevation in ALP [> 2 × ULN] compared 
with aminotransferases and elevation in bilirubin) 
a combination of the above 
• 
• 
The mechanism behind hepatic injury can be dose dependent and predictable or idiosyncratic and 
unpredictable. DILI can be acute (abnormal liver tests for < 3 months) or chronic (abnormal liver 
tests for > 3 months). The mechanism of drug-induced liver injury with Tecfidera is most likely 
to be idiosyncratic. Whilst theoretical mechanisms for idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury 
exist (e.g., direct disruption to hepatocytes, disruption to transporter proteins, disruption to 
mitochondria), the actual mechanism for Tecfidera has yet to be elucidated. 
Orally administered DMF is rapidly and completely hydrolysed to MMF, which is also 
pharmacologically active. DMF was not quantifiable in plasma following oral administrations of 
Tecfidera, but the major site of metabolism remains unknown. This hydrolysis is carried out by 
carboxylesterases, which are expressed at high levels in the liver, small intestine, kidney, and 
lung [Satoh 2006]. The downstream metabolism of MMF occurs via esterases followed by the 
TCA cycle, which is a key part of aerobic respiration in all cells. Consequently, exhalation of 
CO2 was the predominant pathway of DMF elimination. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro data 
indicate CYP enzymes, which are primarily expressed in the liver, are not involved in 
metabolism of DMF/MMF. In summary, as the metabolic pathways of DMF and MMF are 
ubiquitously expressed, metabolism in the liver cannot be ruled out; however, CYP enzymes do 
not appear to be involved. Most of the metabolism of DMF and MMF is via esterases and TCA 
cycle with elimination through CO2 exhalation. Therefore, since the liver is not the primary 
route of DMF metabolism, this is unlikely to provide a mechanism for Tecfidera drug-induced 
liver injury. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
In placebo-controlled studies, elevations of hepatic transaminases were observed. The majority 
of patients with elevations had hepatic transaminases that were < 3 times the ULN. Elevations of 
alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3 times ULN, respectively, were seen 
in 5% and 2% of patients treated with placebo and 6% and 2% of patients treated with Tecfidera. 
Page 41 of 79 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
Elevations in transaminases ≥ 3 times ULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin 
> 2 times ULN, were not observed in placebo-controlled studies. 
Nevertheless, increase of liver enzymes and cases of drug-induced liver injury (elevations in 
transaminases ≥ 3 times ULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times ULN), 
have been reported during postmarketing experience following Tecfidera administration, which 
resolved upon treatment discontinuation. Consequently, drug-induced liver injury was added as 
an ADR in Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the Tecfidera SmPC, and advice relating to the 
monitoring of liver function prior to and during treatment was included in Section 4.4 (Special 
warnings and precautions for use). 
Characterisation of the risk 
This risk is characterised in Table 17.

Incidence in Tecfidera BID: 9.49% (95% CI 7.51%, 11.79%) 
• 
Incidence in Tecfidera TID: 9.96% (95% CI 8.00%, 12.22%) 
(Clopper Pearson exact confidence interval was used to calculate the 
95% confidence intervals of event incidences.)   
In the placebo-controlled studies, the overall incidence of Aes 
potentially associated with hepatic injury was similar across the 
treatment groups (9% placebo, 9% Tecfidera BID, 10% Tecfidera 
TID). The most common Aes across the groups were elevations in liver 
transaminases. In general, the incidence was similar or slightly 
increased in Tecfidera-treated participants compared with placebo: 
ALT increased (5% placebo, 6% Tecfidera BID, 6% Tecfidera TID) 
and AST increased (2% placebo, 4% Tecfidera BID, 4% Tecfidera 
TID).  
On laboratory evaluation, there was an increased incidence of elevation 
in liver transaminases in the Tecfidera groups compared with placebo 
that primarily occurred early within the first 6 months and then 
resolved. Hepatic transaminases remained stable in patients who 
received Tecfidera for more than 2 years. Elevations in transaminases 
> 3 times ULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times 
ULN were not observed during placebo-controlled studies. There were 
no cases of hepatic failure related to Tecfidera. 
Seriousness and severity 
None of the cases were consistent with progressive hepatic injury (led 
to liver failure or liver transplant), or fatality. 
Reversibility and long-term 
outcomes 
The nature of the suspected reported events involves overall 
reversibility, favourable outcomes, and early recognition of cases by 
prescribers.

Impact on quality of life  
In Tecfidera-treated patients all events were considered reversible upon

Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk factors have been identified.  
Preventability 
Routine monitoring of liver function may serve to mitigate the risk through early detection of 
potential progressive hepatic injury. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product 
Considering the nature of the suspected reported events involves overall reversibility, favourable

There is no impact on public health. 
SVII.3.2  Presentation of important potential risks 
SVII.3.2.1  
Serious and opportunistic infections (other than PML and herpes zoster) 
Relevant MedDRA terms: SOC Infections and infestations; SMQ Opportunistic infections. 
Potential mechanisms 
Tecfidera is associated with a risk of severe, prolonged lymphopenia, which is a risk factor for 
the development of serious and opportunistic infections.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
Tecfidera has been associated with a risk of severe, prolonged lymphopenia in approximately 2% 
of the pivotal clinical trial population, which could theoretically lead to an increased risk of 
serious and opportunistic infection.  
However, to date, the incidence of serious infections and opportunistic infections (excluding 
PML and herpes zoster) is similar in patients treated with placebo versus those treated with 
Tecfidera. Therefore, excluding PML infection and herpes zoster, no evidence of an increased 
risk of other serious or opportunistic infections has been demonstrated. 
Characterisation of the risk 
This risk is characterised in Table 18.

Incidence in placebo: 1.44% (95% CI 0.74%, 2.49%)

Incidence in Tecfidera TID: 1.82% (95% CI 1.02%, 2.99%) 
(Clopper Pearson exact confidence interval was used to calculate the 
95% confidence intervals of event incidences.)   
No opportunistic infections were identified in placebo-controlled 
clinical trials.  
The incidence of serious infections (usually defined as serious because 
they required hospitalisation) was similar in patients treated with 
placebo or Tecfidera, (2% vs 2%) respectively.  
Long-term extension study: 
No evidence of an excess of serious or opportunistic infections was 
demonstrated. One case of PML was reported in the setting of severe 
prolonged lymphopenia (See also Important Identified Risk: PML). 
The types of infections and serious infections observed were consistent 
with those typically seen in patients with MS and resolved per standard 
of care. 
Most infections reported were not severe in nature. 
Many infections are treatable, and long-term outcomes are variable. 
Severe infection can lead to significant health issues for individual 
patients with MS and thereby potentially impact quality of life; 
however, the incidence of serious infections is low (≤ 2%) and the 
types of infections observed were consistent with those normally seen 
in patients with MS and resolved per standard of care. No impact on 
quality of life in Tecfidera-treated patients is therefore anticipated.

Impact on quality of life  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Lymphopenia may increase the risk of serious and opportunistic infections.  
Preventability 
In Tecfidera-treated patients, lymphopenia may be a risk factor for the development of serious 
and opportunistic infections; therefore, regular monitoring of lymphocyte counts provides an 
effective preventability measure to identify patients at risk. 
Prior to initiating treatment with Tecfidera, a current complete blood count, including 
lymphocytes, must be performed. If lymphocyte count is found to be below the normal range, 
thorough assessment of possible causes should be completed prior to initiation of treatment with 
Tecfidera.  
Page 44 of 79 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
After starting therapy, complete blood counts, including lymphocytes, must be performed every 
3 months. Discontinue Tecfidera in patients with lymphocyte counts < 0.5 × 109/L persisting for 
more than 6 months. In patients with sustained moderate reductions of absolute lymphocyte 
counts ≥ 0.5 × 109/L and < 0.8 × 109/L for more than 6 months, reassess the risk-benefit of 
Tecfidera treatment. Lymphocyte counts should be followed until recovery (see Table 16, under 
Reversibility and Long-Term Outcomes). This monitoring should prevent patients from 
developing severe and prolonged lymphopenia, and thereby lower the risk of serious and 
opportunistic infection. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product 
In Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of serious infections was similar in 
participants treated with Tecfidera versus placebo (2% vs 2%, respectively), and there was no 
increased incidence of serious infections observed in participants with lymphocyte counts 
< 0.8 × 109/L or < 0.5 × 109/L. Nevertheless, if therapy is continued in the presence of 
lymphopenia, the risk of a serious and opportunistic infection cannot be ruled out, which may 
impact the risk-benefit balance of Tecfidera treatment in individual patients due to risk of the 
condition becoming life-threatening or fatal if not diagnosed or managed appropriately. 
The Tecfidera SmPC provides guidance on the monitoring of lymphocyte counts, which provides 
a means for early identification of those patients who are at increased risk for developing 
lymphopenia and thereby any potential sequelae. If a patient develops a serious infection, 
suspending treatment with Tecfidera should be considered and the benefits and risks should be 
reassessed prior to re-initiation of therapy. Patients receiving Tecfidera should be instructed to 
report symptoms of infections to a physician., and patients with serious infections should not 
start treatment with Tecfidera until the infection(s) is resolved. 
These recommendations are considered to be adequate measures to mitigate the potential risk of 
serious and opportunistic infections, and therefore the risk-benefit balance of the product remains 
favourable.  
Public health impact 
Since there is no evidence of overall increased risk of serious or opportunistic infections 
(excluding PML and herpes zoster), there is no impact on public health. 
SVII.3.2.2 Malignancies  
Relevant MedDRA terms: SMQ Malignant or unspecified tumours  
Potential mechanisms 
Based on its mechanism of action, Tecfidera is considered an immunomodulatory therapy. Since 
immunomodulatory therapies have effects on the immune system, they may influence the body’s 
capacity for tumour surveillance; thereby, there is a theoretical risk that the incidence of 
malignancies may increase with longer durations of treatment with Tecfidera.   
Page 45 of 79 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
In 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies with Tecfidera, renal tubular adenomas and carcinomas 
were observed, which were attributed to an exacerbation of rodent-specific age-related 
nephropathy. The nephropathy observed in aging rodents has no human correlate and since 
Tecfidera was not associated with an increased risk of urinary or renal events in clinical studies, 
these preclinical findings represent a relatively low risk to humans. 
From a review of all available data, no evidence of a causal link between Tecfidera and the 
development of malignancies has been identified, and the types and frequencies of malignancies 
reported in patients treated with Tecfidera are consistent with those observed in the general US 
and global populations.

Incidence in Tecfidera TID: 0.24% (95% CI: 0.03%, 0.88%) 
(Clopper Pearson exact confidence interval was used to calculate the 
95% confidence intervals of event incidences.)    
In the placebo-controlled trials, the overall incidence of malignancies 
was low and similar between the placebo group (< 1%, 3 patients), the 
Tecfidera BID group (< 1%, 2 patients) and the Tecfidera TID group 
(< 1%, 2 subjects). The incidence of malignancies in an active control 
GA group was 1% (4 patients).   
Including patients with longer-term treatment, the incidence rate for 
malignancies overall among all Tecfidera-treated subjects was 375.4 
per 100,000 patient-years (95% CI: 218.7, 601.0), which is within 
expected background rates.  
Seriousness and severity 
The type and nature of malignancies observed were consistent with 
those normally seen in the general or MS population. 
Reversibility and long-term 
outcomes 
The reversibility and long-term outcomes of malignancies observed 
were consistent with those normally seen in the general or MS 
population. 
Impact on quality of life 
(QoL) 
The impact of developing a malignancy on quality of life can vary 
considerably between patients and is dependent on malignancy 
location, stage, and other co-morbidities affecting a patient’s ability to 
tolerate treatment and is therefore difficult to assess outside of an 
individual case-by-case basis. 
However, as there is no evidence of an increased risk of malignancies 
in Tecfidera-treated patients, no impact on quality of life is anticipated.

Risk factors and risk groups 
None known.  
Preventability 
None. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product 
Given the putative immunomodulatory mechanism of action of Tecfidera, malignancies were 
carefully evaluated in clinical studies. In the controlled MS studies, the incidence of 
malignancies was low and balanced across the Tecfidera and placebo groups. There was no 
evidence of an increased incidence rate of malignancy with continued exposure to Tecfidera for 
up to 13 years in the uncontrolled safety extension study. As no evidence of a causal association 
between Tecfidera and the development of malignancies has been identified, no impact on the 
risk-benefit balance of the product is currently considered. 
Public health impact 
As there is no evidence of increased risk of malignancy, there is no impact on public health.   
SVII.3.2.3   Effects on pregnancy outcome  
Relevant MedDRA terms: Not applicable. All pregnancy outcomes reporting maternal or 
paternal exposure to Tecfidera are reviewed.  
Potential mechanisms 
None known. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
In reproductive studies in rats and rabbits, DMF was not found to be teratogenic (i.e., no 
malformation). In the rat during organogenesis, reduction in maternal weight and foetal weights, 
and foetal variations of ossification (metatarsals and hind limb phalanges) were observed. 
Different than malformation, variation is defined as a change that occurs within the normal 
population and is unlikely to adversely affect survival or health of the animal. In rabbits during 
organogenesis, DMF-related effects consisted of maternal weight loss and an increase incidence 
of abortions. In the rat during pregnancy and lactation, lower body weight in the F1 offspring, 
and delays in sexual maturation (preputial separation) in male offspring were observed. It is 
likely that the DMF effects are secondary to maternal toxicity for all the reproductive studies. 
Current data from clinical trials and the postmarketing setting do not suggest that Tecfidera, 
when taken early in pregnancy, has an adverse or negative effect on pregnancy outcome. In 
completed Study 109MS402, 289 prospectively collected pregnancy outcomes were documented 
in patients with MS taking Tecfidera. The median duration of exposure was 4.6 gestational 
weeks with limited exposure after the sixth gestational week. Exposure to Tecfidera during early 
pregnancy did not increase the rates of major congenital malformations compared to those 
reported in the general population.

Version: 16.0 
Characterisation of the risk 
This risk is characterised in Table 20. 
Table 20: 
Characterisation of Important Potential Risk: Pregnancy Outcome  
Frequency 
Seriousness and severity 
Reversibility and long-term 
outcomes 
Cumulatively, to 26 Mar 2021, 5104 cases (reporting 6913 events) of 
maternal exposure to Tecfidera during pregnancy were received, of 
which 3159 were reported prospectively. These cases were reported 
from clinical studies, the MS Pregnancy Registry [Study 109MS402], 
and postmarketing reports. 
Additionally, there were 181 cases of paternal exposure (83 cases from 
solicited postmarketing reports and 98 cases from spontaneous 
postmarketing reports). 
Of the 5104 maternal cases, 361 were lost to follow-up or had an 
unknown outcome, and 1870 had an ongoing or pending pregnancy 
outcome. 
In the remaining 2873 cases, 2211 were live births without congenital 
anomaly. There were 73 cases of congenital anomaly, including live 
births (n = 59), elective termination (n = 11), and still births (n = 3). 
Of the 73 congenital anomaly cases, 27 cases reported either 
non-specific congenital anomalies or functional disorders (these cases 
are excluded per EUROCAT guidance). Of the remaining 46 cases, 
21 were prospective and 25 were retrospective. 
Of the 21 prospective cases with congenital anomaly, 19 were included 
in the EUROCAT prevalence rate calculations, after deducting 3 cases 
of ectopic pregnancy. 
Overall, the prevalence rate for all congenital anomalies with 
Tecfidera, was found to be within the EUROCAT background rate of 
196.89 (118.95 - 305.77) vs 208.35 (207.02 - 209.69), respectively. 
A frequency of abnormal pregnancies from the MS Pregnancy Registry 
[Study 109MS402], as of 15 Mar 2021, is estimated to be 2.3%; this is 
based on 8 reports of major congenital anomalies in 350 pregnancy 
outcomes. 
Seriousness: The moderate amount of human data from the Tecfidera 
pregnancy exposure registry, clinical studies, and postmarketing 
experience do not currently suggest any negative effect of Tecfidera on 
pregnancy outcome. The rate of spontaneous abortions, including early 
pregnancy losses, does not exceed the expected rate of the general 
population [Garcia-Enguidanos 2002]. 
Severity: To be determined 
Reversibility would depend on the type of foetal abnormality and 
severity. Due to the very limited human pregnancy exposure, data are 
currently inadequate to determine effects of Tecfidera on long-term 
outcomes of pregnancy exposure in the infant.

Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
Impact on quality of life  
Current data do not suggest that Tecfidera, when taken early in 
pregnancy, has an adverse or negative effect on pregnancy outcome. 
No impact on quality of life is therefore anticipated. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Women of childbearing potential.  
Preventability 
The SmPC states that Tecfidera should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and if 
the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product 
None. 
Public health impact 
No potential public health risk is considered possible at this time. 
SVII.3.2.4  
Interaction with nephrotoxic medications leading to renal toxicity  
Relevant MedDRA terms: HLT Interactions  
Potential mechanisms 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions of polymedicated MS patients might potentiate renal effects 
of Tecfidera. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
Results of a subgroup analysis within the placebo-controlled studies show that there was an 
increased incidence of renal and urinary AEs (primarily AEs of proteinuria) in participants with 
concomitant PNM compared to those participants who did not receive potentially nephrotoxic 
drugs.  
Characterisation of the risk 
This risk is characterised in Table 21. 
Table 21: 
Characterisation of Important Potential Risk: Interaction with Nephrotoxic 
Medications Leading to Renal Toxicity  
Frequency 
Renal and urinary AEs were observed in placebo and Tecfidera-treated 
participants but the extent of the effect was slightly greater for 
Tecfidera-treated participants: the incidence of renal and urinary AEs 
in participants receiving PNM during study was 21% placebo, 25% 
BID, 26% TID, 25% GA: compared with those not receiving such 
medications: 16% placebo, 15% BID, 18% TID, 11% GA. 
Page 49 of 79 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
Seriousness and severity 
The majority of renal and urinary adverse event reports were 
non-serious. 
Reversibility and long-term 
outcomes 
Analysis showed increases in eGFR within 4 weeks of treatment 
initiation which were sustained over time in Tecfidera-treated 
participants compared to placebo-treated participants.  
Impact on quality of life  
None anticipated. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
MS patients receiving nephrotoxic drugs. 
Preventability 
Warnings are included in the SmPC regarding concurrent administration with nephrotoxic 
medicinal products.  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product 
None anticipated.  
Public health impact 
Low. The majority of renal and urinary adverse event reports were non-serious, and analysis 
showed increases in eGFR within 4 weeks of treatment initiation which were sustained over time 
in Tecfidera-treated participants compared with placebo-treated participants.  
SVII.3.3  Presentation of Missing Information 
SVII.3.3.1   Long term efficacy and safety   
Evidence source 
The completed long-term safety extension study (109MS303) had participants exposed to 
Tecfidera and followed for up to 13 years. Study 109MS401 is ongoing and also aims to assess 
the long-term effectiveness and safety of Tecfidera.  
Long-latency safety concerns such as malignancies and lymphopenia will continue to be 
monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
Population in need of further characterisation 
The ongoing observational study (109MS401) is evaluating long-term efficacy and the safety 
profile following long-term treatment in Tecfidera-treated adult patients. The ongoing extension 
phase of Study 109MS306 is assessing the long-term safety and health outcomes in patients aged 
10 to < 18 years. 
Page 50 of 79 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
SVII.3.3.2  
Safety profile in patients over the age of 55 years  
Evidence source 
The Tecfidera pivotal clinical trials primarily enrolled participants 18 to 55 years of age and did 
not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 55 and over to determine whether they respond 
differently than younger patients.  
Population in need of further characterisation 
The results of an Analysis of Variance have demonstrated that age does not have a clinically 
significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of dimethyl fumarate; however, pharmacokinetics in 
patients aged 65 and over has not been studied.  
Regular reviews of postmarketing data using 2 age cutoffs (> 55 years and ≥ 65 years) have 
indicated that the pattern and nature of adverse events reported in these patients are consistent 
with the experience of the total population in the postmarketing setting, and with that observed 
during clinical development. Commonly reported events in patients aged > 55 years and 
≥ 65 years include lymphopenia, flushing, lymphocyte count decreased, white blood cell 
decreased and fall, which are consistent with the known safety profile of Tecfidera. 
Consequently, cumulative data obtained to date do not change the overall safety profile or 
risk-benefit assessment of Tecfidera; and based on these data and the mode of action of 
Tecfidera, there are no reasons to consider any requirement for dose adjustments in elderly 
patients. 
Nevertheless, as an ongoing post-authorisation safety study (Study 109MS401: an observational 
study to better characterise the long-term risk-benefit profile of Tecfidera in patients with MS 
who are prescribed Tecfidera under routine clinical care) is currently ongoing in order to 
address this area of missing information, the safety profile of Tecfidera in patients over the age 
of 55 years will remain as a safety concern until the results of this study are available. 
SVII.3.3.3  
Safety profile in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment 
Evidence source 
As the renal pathway is a secondary route of elimination for Tecfidera, no formal PK studies in 
patients with renal impairment have been performed, and no patients with severe renal 
impairment are known to have received Tecfidera in pivotal clinical trials.   
Reviews of postmarketing data have identified relatively few cases of patients with renal 
impairment, and a review of the types and nature of AEs reported in those patients who did fulfill 
the criteria for renal impairment does not suggest that the safety profile of Tecfidera differs from 
that in those with normal renal function. In addition, data from the long-term extension study, 
109MS303, showed that the safety profile of participants with mild renal impairment was similar 
to that in participants with normal GFR. Data related to safety in moderate-to-severe renal 
impairment continues to be considered missing information. 
Population in need of further characterisation 
Exhalation of carbon dioxide is the primary route of Tecfidera elimination, accounting for 
60% of the dose. Renal elimination is a secondary route of elimination, accounting for 16% of 
the dose. Therefore, on theoretical grounds, a patient with renal impairment would not be 
Page 51 of 79 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
expected to accumulate Tecfidera or its metabolites, and the safety profile of Tecfidera in such 
patients is not expected to be different from that in patients with normal renal function.  
Regular reviews of postmarketing data have identified relatively few cases of patients with renal 
impairment; however, a review of the types and nature of AEs reported in those patients who did 
fulfil the criteria for renal impairment does not suggest the safety profile of Tecfidera differs 
from those with normal renal function. Consequently, cumulative data obtained to date do not 
indicate that the use of Tecfidera in patients with renal impairment impacts the overall safety 
profile or risk-benefit assessment of Tecfidera; and given the nature and mechanism of clearance 
of Tecfidera, no effects or dose adjustments are anticipated or required. 
Nevertheless, the use of Tecfidera in patients with a history of renal impairment is currently 
being investigated in an ongoing post-authorisation safety study (Study 109MS401). Therefore, 
moderate to severe renal impairment will continue to be considered missing information until the 
results of this study are available. In the long-term extension study (Study 109MS303), however, 
it was determined that the safety profile of participants with mild renal impairment was similar to 
that in participants with normal GFR. Mild renal impairment no longer will be considered 
missing information. 
SVII.3.3.4  
Safety profile in patients with hepatic impairment  
Evidence source 
As DMF is metabolised by esterases (without the involvement of the CYP450 system), no formal 
PK studies in patients with hepatic impairment have been performed, and no patients with severe 
hepatic impairment are known to have received Tecfidera in pivotal clinical trials.   
Population in need of further characterisation 
Regular review of postmarketing data has identified relatively few cases of patients with hepatic 
impairment; however, a review of the types and nature of AEs reported in those patients who did 
fulfil the criteria for hepatic impairment does not suggest the safety profile of Tecfidera differs 
from those with normal hepatic function. Consequently, cumulative data obtained to date do not 
indicate that the use of Tecfidera in patients with hepatic impairment impacts the overall safety 
profile or risk-benefit assessment of Tecfidera; and given the nature and mechanism of clearance 
of Tecfidera, no effects or dose adjustments are anticipated or required. 
Nevertheless, the use of Tecfidera in patients with a history of hepatic impairment is currently 
being investigated in an ongoing post-authorisation safety study (Study 109MS401). Therefore, 
this area of missing information will remain as a safety concern until the results of this study are 
available. 
SVII.3.3.5  
Safety profile in patients with severe active gastrointestinal disease 
Evidence source 
Participants with severe active GI disease were not included in the pre-authorisation clinical 
development programme.  
Page 52 of 79 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera  
Version: 16.0 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information 
As gastrointestinal events are commonly reported with Tecfidera, participants with pre-existing 
gastrointestinal disease may be at greater risk of serious events. 
Consequently, an ongoing post-authorisation safety study (Study 109MS401) is currently 
ongoing in order to address this area of missing information. 
SVII.3.3.6  
Increased risk of infection in patients concomitantly taking anti-neoplastic or 
immunosuppressive therapies  
Evidence source 
Tecfidera has a low potential to cause drug interactions due to the way it is metabolised and as it 
has low affinity for protein binding, and no potential drug interactions with Tecfidera or its 
primary metabolite, MMF, were identified in in vitro CYP inhibition and induction studies or in 
P-glycoprotein studies. Furthermore, the relatively low protein binding of Tecfidera and MMF 
limits the potential for AEs due to displacement from plasma proteins by concomitantly 
administered medications. 
Nevertheless, participants receiving anti-neoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies were not 
included in the Tecfidera clinical development programme. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information 
It is possible that the effect of Tecfidera on immune function may be additive when combined 
with known immunosuppressants or immunomodulators, leading to the theoretical possibility 
that concomitant administration of Tecfidera with these therapies may increase the risk of 
infection or may lessen the effects of some anti-neoplastic agents as a result of the 
anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of Tecfidera. 
In the Phase 2 add-on therapy study (Study 109MS201), data did not suggest an alteration in 
safety or tolerability when Tecfidera was combined with commonly used MS therapies such as 
IFN and glatiramer acetate. In addition, the intermittent use of short courses of intravenous 
corticosteroids to treat MS relapses was not associated with a clinically relevant increase of 
infection in clinical studies. Tecfidera has also been given in combination with methotrexate in a 
study in rheumatoid arthritis with no change in the safety profile.  
Even though Tecfidera reduces leucocyte and lymphocyte counts, it does not appear to alter 
immune function such that there is significant difference in infection rates, types, and severity 
when compared with placebo. Regular reviews of postmarketing data have not identified any 
safety concerns in patients receiving concomitant treatment with Tecfidera and anti-neoplastic or 
immunosuppressive therapies, and the safety profile observed in these patients is consistent with 
the known safety profile of Tecfidera. Therefore, there is likely a low risk of increased infections 
in patients taking anti-neoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies concomitantly with Tecfidera. 
Nevertheless, a post-authorisation safety study (Study 109MS401) is currently ongoing and aims 
to determine the safety profile of Tecfidera during concomitant use with anti-neoplastic or 
immunosuppressive therapies. This area of missing information, whether there is an increased 
risk of infection in patients concomitantly taking antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies, 
will remain as a safety concern until the results of this study are available.

PART III: PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-
AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES) 
III.1 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Biogen employs routine pharmacovigilance activities consistent with the ICH E2E 
Pharmacovigilance Planning Guideline in order to further characterise all of the safety concerns 
discussed in this EU RMP.  
Routine Biogen pharmacovigilance activities (as defined by standard operating procedures and 
guidelines) are designed to assess the ongoing safety profile of Tecfidera throughout clinical 
development and in the post-authorisation period in order to characterise and communicate 
pertinent data appropriately. A comprehensive description of all aspects of the 
pharmacovigilance system is provided in the Pharmacovigilance System Master File, which is 
available upon request. 
In addition to adverse reactions reporting and signal detection activities, the following routine 
pharmacovigilance activities are also employed in order to provide further characterisation data 
for specific safety concerns: 
  Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires  
  Data collection forms at different time points post-event (up to 24 months) are used for 
case reports of PML, to aid further characterisation of the event and identification of 
potential risk factors. These data collection forms aim to collect detailed information 
relating to suspected PML events in a standardised fashion, to enable timely and robust 
collection of data, thereby optimising risk evaluation.  
  Data collection forms are also used to enable timely and robust collection of data for 
events of drug-induced liver injury, serious and opportunistic infections (other than PML 
and herpes zoster), malignancies, moderate lymphopenia, and severe lymphopenia, 
thereby optimising risk evaluation.  
  All data collection forms are provided in Annex 4. 
III.2 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
Data from 2 studies are anticipated to aid the further characterisation of the safety concerns 
described in Part II:SVII.3. These studies are summarised below.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR 
TECFIDERA (DIMETHYL FUMARATE) 
 
 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera™ (dimethyl fumarate) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Tecfidera. The RMP details important risks of Tecfidera, how 
these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about the risks and 
uncertainties (missing information) of Tecfidera. 
The Tecfidera SmPC and its PL give essential information to healthcare professionals and 
patients on how Tecfidera should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Tecfidera should be read in the context of all available relevant 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report.  
Important new safety concerns or changes to the current described safety concerns will be 
included in updates of the RMP for Tecfidera.  
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Tecfidera is authorised for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains dimethyl fumarate as the active substance, and it is given orally. 
Information about the evaluation of the benefits of Tecfidera can be found in the European 
Public Assessment Report for Tecfidera, including in its plain-language summary, available on 
the EMA website under the medicine’s webpage.  
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Tecfidera together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about the risks of Tecfidera are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals, 
respectively; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; and 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Tecfidera is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.

Version: 16.0 
ANNEX 6 - DETAILS OF PROPOSED ADDITIONAL RISK 
MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES 
For the important identified risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder distributed a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication in 
European Union countries by 12 Nov 2020 as an additional risk minimisation measure to inform 
healthcare professionals about cases of PML in the setting of lymphopenia (mild). The following 
key elements were included: 
  Cases of PML in the setting of mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count ≥ 0.8 ×109/L 
and below the lower limit of normal) have been reported in patients treated with 
Tecfidera; previously, PML had been confirmed only in the setting of moderate to 
severe lymphopenia. 
  Tecfidera is contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed PML. 
  Tecfidera should not be initiated in patients with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte 
counts < 0.5 ×109/L). 
 
If the lymphocyte count is below the normal range, a thorough assessment of possible 
causes should be completed before initiating treatment with Tecfidera. 
  Tecfidera should be discontinued in patients with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte 
counts < 0.5 ×109/L) persisting for more than 6 months. 
 
If a patient develops PML, Tecfidera must be permanently discontinued. 
  Advise patients to inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment and 
symptoms suggestive of PML, since they may notice symptoms of which the patient 
is not aware. 
  Among over 475,000 patients exposed to Tecfidera, 11 cases of PML have been 
confirmed. 
  As currently recommended, all patients should have absolute lymphocyte counts 
(ALC) measured before initiating treatment and every 3 months thereafter. 
 
In patients with lymphocyte counts below the lower limit of normal as defined by 
local laboratory reference range, enhanced vigilance is now recommended and 
additional factors that may potentially contribute to an increased risk for PML in 
patients with lymphopenia should be considered. These include: 
  Duration of Tecfidera therapy. Cases of PML have occurred after approximately 
1 to 5 years of treatment, although the exact relationship with duration of 
treatment is unknown. 
  Profound decreases in CD4+ and especially in CD8+ T cell counts. 
  Prior immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy. 
 
 
Biogen European Union Risk Management Plan for Tecfidera – Annex 6 
Version: 16.0 
 
In patients with sustained moderate reductions of absolute lymphocyte counts ≥ 0.5 × 
109/L and < 0.8 × 109/L for more than 6 months, the benefit/risk of Tecfidera 
treatment should be re-assessed. 
  Physicians should evaluate their patients to determine if the symptoms are indicative 
of neurological dysfunction and, if so, whether these symptoms are typical of MS or 
possibly suggestive of PML. 
  At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, Tecfidera should be withheld and 
appropriate diagnostic evaluations carried out, including determination of JCV DNA 
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
methodology. 
 
It is important to note that patients developing PML following recent discontinuation 
of natalizumab may not present with lymphopenia.

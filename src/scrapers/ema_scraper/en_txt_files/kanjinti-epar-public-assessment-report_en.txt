2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
This centralised marketing authorisation application concerns the Biotech medicinal product Kanjinti. It is an 
abridged application for a biosimilar under Article 10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 
2004/27/EC. 
About the product 
Kanjinti has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the innovator product Herceptin 
(trastuzumab), which was approved in the European Union (EU) in August 2000 (EMEA/H/C/000278). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 9/71 
 
  
  
 
Kanjinti (also referred as ABP 980) is supplied in 2 presentations containing 150 mg or 420 mg per single-use 
vials. 
Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2). Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20%-30% of primary breast cancers. Studies 
of HER2-positivity rates in gastric cancer (GC) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ 
hybridisation (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) have shown that there is a broad variation of 
HER2-positivity ranging from 6.8% to 34.0% for IHC and 7.1% to 42.6% for FISH. Studies indicate that breast 
cancer patients whose tumours overexpress HER2 have a shortened disease-free survival compared to patients 
whose tumours do not overexpress HER2. HER2 overexpression was found in a number of disease states, 
including metastatic breast cancers, early breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC). The extracellular 
domain of the receptor (ECD) can be shed into the blood stream and measured in serum samples (see Herceptin 
SmPC section 5.1). 
Trastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta membrane region of HER2’s 
extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 signalling and prevents 
the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism of HER2. As a result, trastuzumab 
has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that 
overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent mediator of antibody dependent cell mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 
overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2 (see Herceptin SmPC 
section 5.1). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The marketing authorisation application of Kanjinti is an abridged application for similar biological medicinal 
product under Article 10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP in February 2011, February 2012, March 2012, 
December 2012 and June 2012. The Scientific Advice pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the 
dossier. 
The development programme was according to the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005, Rev1. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product Kanjinti (ABP 980), also referred as drug product (DP) by the applicant, is a powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion containing 150 mg or 420 mg trastuzumab as active substance. Other 
ingredients are: histidine monohydrochloride, histidine, trehalose dihydrate and polysorbate 20. The product is 
available in clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film and an aluminum 
seal with flip-off dust cover. ABP 980 has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The active substance of Kanjinti (ABP 980), trastuzumab, is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody of 
the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 
receptor. ABP 980 is produced from a mammalian Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell line. ABP 980 consists of 
2 heavy chains (HC) of the lgG1 subclass and 2 light chains (LC) of the kappa subclass. ABP 980 contains 32 total 
cysteine residues involved in both intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds. Each HC contains 449 amino acids 
with 4 intrachain disulfide bonds. Each LC contains 214 amino acids with 2 intrachain disulfide bonds. The amino 
acid sequence of ABP 980 is based on that of the reference product Herceptin, with the exception that ABP 980 
sequence was designed without the HC C-terminal lysine. Each HC contains an N-linked glycan at the consensus 
glycosylation site on Asn300. The theoretical molecular mass of the fully assembled main glycoform containing 1 
A2G0F moiety per HC is 148,219 Da.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
ABP 980 active substance is manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) at 
Patheon Biologics B.V., Groningen, The Netherlands.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The trastuzumab active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. The main steps of the 
manufacturing process are fermentation, recovery and purification. The ABP 980 antibody is expressed in a 
transfected CHO cell line. The process begins with the thawing of a working cell bank (WCB) vial. A single

production lot is initiated from a single vial thaw. The purification of ABP 980 comprises chromatography steps 
and two orthogonal dedicated virus clearance steps 
The container closure system for active substance is a bag. The bag material component complies with Ph.Eur. 
3.1.7. 
Control of Materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been submitted. 
Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while specifications 
(including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No human or animal derived 
materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process and acceptable documents have been 
provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the establishment of cell substrate. 
A two-tier cell bank system, consisting of a Master Cell Bank (MCB) and WCB was generated. MCB and WCB were 
characterised according to ICH requirements. The proposed reduced testing of the WCB has been adequately 
justied. The adventitious agents assays test results indicate that the cell bank is sterile and free of detectable 
mycoplasma and viruses. All newly prepared WCBs will also be manufactured in accordance with cGMP guideline 
and qualified, complying with ICH Q5D and Q5A (R1). During routine manufacturing, the cell culture age is 
controlled to less than limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA). This is supported by several assays demonstrating 
genetic stability of the production cell line and that the LIVCA cells are free of adventitious viruses. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Performance indicators are used to evaluate in-process performance. Performance indicators are designated as 
in-process controls (IPCs) for routine manufacture. Limits for IPCs are categorised as rejection, action, or 
control limits. An adequate justification for IPC limits is provided. A comprehensive overview of critical 
in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed throughout the trastuzumab manufacturing process 
is given. Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the 
active substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters 
and in-process tests. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. 
Process Validation 
The trastuzumab active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. All acceptance criteria 
for the critical operational parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled 
demonstrating that the purification process consistently produces trastuzumab active substance of reproducible 
quality that complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
Small scale studies (chemical hold times) were carried-out to define hold times for the in-process pools and most 
of these hold times have been validated at commercial scale.  
Active substance is shipped using qualified shipping containers. 
Manufacturing process development 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the clinical development 
program. Several changes have been introduced during the development of the manufacturing process. 
Analytical comparability of the active substance obtained from the different processes and scales has been 
demonstrated in comparability studies. Additional characterisation tests assessing the primary structure, 
glycosylation, charge variants, and biological function were carried out; stability under accelerated and stress

conditions. Although minor differences were observed, it could be concluded that material from commercial 
scale is comparable to the pre-clinical and clinical material used during development. 
The Applicant followed an enhanced development approach using existing knowledge on the reference product, 
ABP 980 and other monoclonal antibodies, process development and manufacturing experience, risk 
assessment tools, and process characterisation studies to define an integrated control strategy as outlined in 
ICH Q11. A comprehensive set of product quality attributes of trastuzumab was assessed for their potential 
impact on efficacy and safety and critical quality attributes (CQA) were identified. The impact of the active 
substance and finished product manufacturing steps on CQA was evaluated and investigated in univariate 
and/or multivariate process characterisation studies using qualified small-scale models of the respective process 
steps.  
Process characterisation studies were conducted using qualified small-scale models that are representative of 
the commercial-scale process, by executing a series of studies including univariate, multivariate, and process 
challenge experiments. Upon completion of the process characterisation studies, production bioreactor process 
parameters were classified based on their effects on performance indicators.  
The integrated control strategy incorporates a number of control elements including process parameters, 
in-process controls, release specifications, and periodic testing controls (e.g., validation, comparability, 
stability) of the active substance and finished product. The integrated control strategy reflects knowledge of 
product quality attributes and their potential to impact patient safety and product efficacy, as well as an 
understanding of how these attributes are controlled during manufacturing.  
Characterisation 
The trastuzumab active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a human IgG1-type 
antibody. The analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure. Furthermore, heterogeneity of the 
active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size and charge variants, glycosylation and other 
product-related substances and impurities. The biological characterisation included binding (HER2, Fc gamma 
receptor type IIIa[V] FcγRIIIa[V], and Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn)) and functional (proliferation inhibition, 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)) activity covering Fab and Fc related functions of ABP 980. 
Product- and process-related impurities were identified and adequately addressed. Process-related impurities 
are present at low levels and are well controlled by the active substance manufacturing process. A risk-based 
assessment was conducted for raw materials used in the process to identify components requiring evaluation of 
process clearance. All tested reagents were cleared below the assay limit of quantitation (LOQ) by the process. 
The results indicated that the reagent clearance capability of the process substantially exceeds the clearance 
requirement. In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
Specification 
The specification tests include appearance (visual), identity, purity, adventitious agents, potency, quantity and 
general tests. The test for purity was amended, the acceptance criteria for potency were tightened and 
additional acceptance criteria were updated. The updated set of specifications is considered adequate.

Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines; suitability of compendial methods addressing safety aspects 
(bioburden, endotoxin, mycoplasma) has been verified. 
The method for the determination of biological activity is an anti-proliferation assay, which performs well with 
regard to accuracy, repeatability precision, and robustness.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
Primary ABP 980 reference standard and the working reference standard were established for release. Both 
materials were qualified and the suitability for use was demonstrated. The proposed qualification procedure for 
future reference standards is acceptable. 
Stability 
An expiry period is proposed for active substance stored at the recommended storage conditions. The stability 
results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in the proposed 
container. 
Real time, real condition stability data on commercial batches of active substance from the commercial 
manufacturing process stored in a container representative of the one proposed for commercial manufacture for 
up to 36 months and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 5 ºC were provided. Long term stability 
data derived from studies at recommended storage condition for 2 primary batches are available for 36 months 
and for one primary batch for 18 months. Appearance (including colour and clarity), purity, potency, quantity 
and pH were tested during stability, this is acceptable. There are no trends during the long term conditions. 
Results on stress conditions at 25 ºC were also provide and are supportive of the proposed storage conditions. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the 
European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to 
the Rapporteur and EMA. 
A Post Approval Change Management Protocol is being included which outlines future shelf life extensions of the 
active substance. The implementation of the results will be submitted as Type IB variation. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
The ABP 980 active substance manufacturing process development occurred in 4 distinct phases. Process 
changes were made to accommodate the increase in process scale and to improve robustness for commercial 
production. Analytical comparability evaluations were performed to demonstrate comparability of ABP 980 
active substance manufactured during development.. The results demonstrate that active substances produced 
at all 4 distinct phases can be considered comparable.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product (also referred to as DP) is supplied as a sterile, white to pale yellow, preservative free 
lyophilised powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing trastuzumab as active substance 
L-histidine hydrochloride, L-histidine, α,α-trehalose dihydrate, and polysorbate 20. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation. 
ABP 980 is supplied in 2 presentations containing 150 mg or 420 mg per single-use vials.  
The finished product is intended for reconstitution with 7.2 mL (150 mg) or 20 mL (420 mg) of sterile water for 
injections. Upon reconstitution, each vial contains approximately 21 mg/mL ABP 980, the reconstituted product 
is intended for dilution in saline (0.9% sodium chloride) for intravenous administration. No formula overages are 
included. The higher nominal amount of ABP 980 of 156 mg per 150 mg vial and 440 mg per 420 mg vial, 
respectively, has been justified.  
As the 420 mg vial presentation is not authorised in Europe, the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
states that the 420 mg vial will only be for single-use. 
Amgen developed ABP 980 drug product to have the same formulation, route of administration, dosage form, 
and strength as the reference product Herceptin (trastuzumab). The small quantitative differences in the 
excipient content are considered acceptable. Formulation development studies demonstrated that ABP 980 is 
physically and chemically stable after lyophilisation in the proposed formulation. The finished product 
formulation is identical to the formulation of the active substance and is not modified during the finished product 
manufacturing. The intended commercial formulation is the same as that used during clinical studies and both 
presentations were used in clinical studies. 
The finished product is stored in 20 mL (for the 150 mg strength) or 50 mL (for the 420 mg strength) clear glass 
type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film and an aluminium seal with flip-off dust 
cover. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
EU batch release is performed by Amgen Europe B.V., Breda, Netherlands. 
Process characterisation was conducted by executing experiments to determine the effect of varying select 
process parameter set points on relevant product quality and performance indicators. Process development took 
place at different manufacturing sites as described under the comparability exercise. Minor modifications were 
implemented to accommodate an increase in process scale and facility fit. Identical raw materials and container 
closure components were used for the clinical and commercial processes. Overall, comparability could be 
demonstrated for all sites.  
The different manufacturing steps are sufficiently described. The provided control strategy for the DP 
manufacturing process is also acceptable: the classification of input and output parameters is justified and 
supported by adequately defined limits/ranges supported by data generated during process design studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 15/71 
 
  
  
 
The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls 
are adequate. 
Product specification 
The specification include tests for the lyophilised product (appearance, moisture content and reconstitution 
time) and tests for the reconstituted product: appearance, colour, , identity, purity and impurities , potency , 
quantity, osmolality, pH , subvisible particles,  adventitious agents. 
Specifications for finished product release are set in accordance with Ph. Eur. Requirements and ICH Q6B. 
Appearance of the reconstituted drug product, although not in accordance with the Ph. Eur. Monograph 
monoclonal antibodies for human use (2031), is considered justified. The potency assay acceptance criteria 
were tightened during the procedure  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately   described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data, of the finished product, generated using the commercial methods, were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
The same reference standard is used for testing the active substance and finished product. 
Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the 30 months shelf-life when stored at the recommended storage 
temperature of 2°C to 8°C (referred to as 5°C), as stated in the SmPC, are acceptable. 
Real time/real condition stability data, and 6 months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and stress 
conditions 40ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The stability specification includes all the stability indicating tests of the release specification. The results 
observed in the accelerated and stress studies are supported by forced degradation studies. Kanjinti was shown 
to be sensitive to light exposure and temperature cycling. Lyophilised finished product samples subjected to ICH 
and clinical lighting conditions in secondary packaging showed no change in product quality relative to control 
samples, demonstrating that the secondary packing protects the ABP 980 drug product from photodegradation 
After reconstitution with sterile water for injections, the reconstituted solution is physically and chemically stable 
for 48 hours at 2°C - 8°C. Additionally, solutions of Kanjinti for intravenous infusion are physically and 
chemically stable in polyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene bags containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection for 24 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30°C, as demonstrated by the 
compatibility studies, stored for up to 48 hours.

A post approval Change Management Protocol – Finished Product Shelf Life is being included which outlines 
future shelf life extensions and the mechanism to submit real-time data. The PACMP is acceptable and the 
results will be submitted via Type IB variation. 
Comparability exercise for Finished Medicinal Drug Product 
The initial 150 mg drug product development and clinical batches were manufactured at a clinical manufacturing 
site. Subsequently, the process was transferred from to an alternate clinical manufacturing site. For commercial 
manufacturing, the 150 mg and 420 mg manufacturing processes were transferred to a commercial 
manufacturing site. Overall the data set indicates that the drug product manufactured at commercial 
manufacturing site is comparable to drug product manufactured at clinical manufacturing sites.  
Adventitious agents 
No animal or human derived materials are used in the manufacturing process of ABP 980. The TSE risk is 
considered negligible. Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) has been demonstrated. Cell 
banks were tested for the absence of adventitious viruses in accordance with applicable guidelines. The 
unprocessed harvest is routinely tested for viral contaminants. Effective and robust dedicated virus clearance 
stepsare integrated into the manufacturing process and the chromatography steps contribute to virus reduction. 
Virus clearance by these steps has been adequately validated in accordance with ICH Q5A and CPMP/ 
BWP/268/95. In summary, the implemented measures ensure a high safety margin with respect to adventitious 
agents. 
GMO 
N/A 
Biosimilarity 
Amgen used EU sourced Herceptin as the comparator arm in the nonclinical and clinical program. Thus, 
analytical similarity assessment is performed between ABP 980 and EU sourced Herceptin. A total of 33 
Herceptin batches including all lots used in the clinical trials, were tested in the analytical similarity assessment. 
The ABP 980 lots evaluated as part of analytical similarity assessment included those used in the clinical trials 
and the process validation lots, manufactured at intended commercial site, scale and process. For certain 
assays, subsets of batches were used, which was justified. 
The comprehensive analytical similarity assessment included comparative evaluations of biological activities, 
primary structure, higher order structure, particles and aggregates, product-related substances and impurities, 
thermal stability and degradation studies, general properties, and process-related impurities. Data were 
evaluated against pre-defined similarity assessment criteria. A multi-tiered approach was used to define 
similarity. For attributes where significant differences may pose a risk to efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity, a 
quality range was used. For the quality range approach, similarity was demonstrated if > 90% of the individual 
values satisfied the limits. 
As process-related impurities do not have to be comparable, but need to be eliminated to acceptable levels, 
sufficient process capability for removal was demonstrated by spiking studies and process validation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 17/71 
 
  
  
Regarding the primary structure the results demonstrate that ABP 980 has a similar intact molecular mass 
compared to Herceptin, similar levels of the reduced and deglycosylated LC and HC masses, the same amino 
acid sequence, similar disulphide structure and similar levels of free sulfhydryl.  
Profiles of the particle and aggregate content of ABP 980 and Herceptin were assessed using a combination of 
test methods. ABP 980 has similar or lower levels of subvisible particles as compared to Herceptin. 
Product-related substances and impurities of ABP 980 and Herceptin were assessed using a combination of 
methods that evaluate size and charge variants. Slightly lower amounts of SE-UHPLC main peak are observed 
for ABP 980. An increase of HMW species is observed at the same time. The predominant HMW species have 
been characterised as dimers. It is agreed that the overall levels of HMW are low and it is unlikely that this minor 
quantitative difference does impact biological activity and/or safety.  
Two side-by-side experiments were included for profile comparison. The results demonstrate that ABP 980 has 
a similar glycan map profile: the ABP 980 lots are within the quality range for afucosylation, for high mannose, 
galactosylation, afucosylated galactosylation, and sialylation. Nevertheless a cluster of batches of the reference 
product seem to exhibit lower levels of afucosylation, galactosylation, and afucosylated galactosylation, all three 
impacting ADCC activity and potentially clinical efficacy. As requested, the applicant recalculated the quality 
ranges by excluding that cluster and updated the specification accordingly.  
Differences are observed for acidic and main peaks by CEX-HPLC. These modifications are not considered to 
impact biological activity as demonstrated by the characterisation of the acidic peak fractions with regard to 
potency and ADCC activity. It is therefore agreed that the differences are unlikely to be clinically meaningful. 
Thermal forced degradation rates obtained for ABP 980 and Herceptin are similar for SE-UHPLC, rCE-SDS, 
nrCE-SDS, CEX-HPLC, and potency. 
The biological activities were evaluated by a comprehensive set of functional assays and binding studies 
addressing both Fab and Fc-functions of the molecule.  
No significant differences were observed for assays addressing inhibition of HER2 signaling such as Proliferation 
Inhibition Bioassays in BT-474 and NCI-N87 cells, HER2 Binding by ELISA, Inhibition of AKT Phosphorylation. 
No meaningful differences are observed in FcRn and FcγR binding, except for the FcγRIIIa Binding. Although it is 
agreed that all of the ABP 980 lots are within the quality range for relative FcγRIIIa (158F) binding, the same 
cluster of batches of the reference product which exhibited lower levels of afucosylation, seem to exhibit lower 
binding activity. Lower binding activities to the FcγRIIIa receptors are not unexpected due to the differences in 
afucosylation. 
ADCC activity was measured both by engineered NK92 huFcγRIIIa (158V) and isolated PBMC cells as effector 
cells and SKBR3 HER2-expressing cells as target cells. With both tests, ABP 980 and Herceptin have comparable 
ADCC activity. The data confirm that the relative ADCC activity of all ABP 980 lots is entirely within the Min/Max 
range of the reference product. In line with the results for afucosylation and FcγRIIIa binding it is noted that the 
results indicate a cluster of batches of the reference product exhibiting lower ADCC activity. In addition results 
obtained for the reference product lots display higher variability whereas the results measured for the Kanjinti 
lots are within a very narrow range at the upper range of the reference product. Given the correlation between 
levels of afucosylation, FcγRIII binding and ADCC it is not surprising that the same cluster of batches of the 
reference product which exhibited lower levels of afucosylation and lower FcγRIII binding also have lower ADCC 
activity.   
The data provided, including the results on FcγRIIa binding, illustrate that ABP 980 has similar ADCP activity as 
compared to Herceptin. Although ABP 980 has higher average relative C1q binding as compared to Herceptin, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 18/71 
 
  
  
this difference is not considered to be clinically meaningful since there is no complement-dependent cytotoxicity 
(CDC) exhibited by either product as demonstrated in CDC assays with rituximab as control. Furthermore CDC 
activity was not reported as mechanism of action for trastuzumab 
Overall it can be concluded that from a quality point of view, ABP 980 can be considered as highly similar to 
Herceptin. In addition the data obtained for ABP 980 also show that the results for all relevant quality attributes 
are within very narrow ranges, suggesting that the manufacturing process is robust, consistent and well 
controlled.

Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Module 3 of the dossier for ABP 980 is of good quality and the information provided is sufficiently detailed.  
Similarity between ABP 980 and the reference product, EU-Herceptin, has been addressed in an extensive 
comparability exercise. The similarity between ABP 980 and EU-Herceptin can be confirmed. Furthermore the 
data show that the ranges obtained for ABP 980 are very narrow suggesting that the manufacturing process is 
robust, consistent and well controlled. 
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.4.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
The biological activities pertaining to the primary mechanisms of action and other known biological activities, 
including the absence of specific functions expected for ABP 980 and trastuzumab, were evaluated by a 
comprehensive set of functional assays and binding studies. It is agreed that all of the ABP 980 lots are within 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 23/71 
 
  
  
the quality range for relative FcγRIIIa (158F) Binding. Nevertheless the same cluster of batches of the reference 
product which exhibited lower levels of afucosylation, seem to exhibit lower binding activity. Lower binding 
activities to the FcγRIIIa receptors are not unexpected due to the differences in afucosylation. As already 
discussed above, this correlation between levels of afucosylation, FcγRIII binding and ADCC fits well to the 
cluster of batches of the reference product which exhibited lower levels of afucosylation, and lower FcγRIII 
binding also seem to have lower ADCC activity. 
The results of the nonclinical program demonstrate a similarity between ABP 980 and trastuzumab with respect 
to inhibition of tumour growth in BT-474 and NCI-N87 xenograft models. In the NCI-N87 xenograft model at a 
dose of 3mg/kg the T/C ratio for Biosimilar/Herceptin is 81.6% suggesting a stronger tumour inhibition by the 
biosimilar. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of ABP 980 was assessed in a GLP-compliant, 1-month multiple-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus 
monkey. Validation results show that the method described for the determination of Herceptin and ABP 980 in 
Cynomolgus monkey serum has adequate precision, accuracy and selectivity. Based on t1/2, AUC0-inf, 
AUC0-96h and AUC0-168h values, trastuzumab exposure was similar after injection of Herceptin or FTMB (ratios 
ranged between 0.94 and 1.15 on day 1 and between 1.08 and 1.15 in week 4). 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicology program with ABP 980 and trastuzumab includes a comparative 1-month repeat-dose monkey 
toxicology study, a 14-day repeat-dose rat toxicology study, and two tissue cross-reactivity studies with frozen 
human tissues. In line with guidance on biosimilars, single dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and 
developmental and reproductive toxicity studies are not warranted. 
In the GLP compliant study in cynomolgus monkeys the test item FTMB is equivalent to ABP 980. Six female 
cynomolgus monkeys were treated iv twice every week for a period of 4 weeks at the dose-level of 25 mg/kg. 
No unscheduled mortalities occurred and no signs of systemic toxicity were observed. Local reactions were 
observed in both trastuzumab-treated groups, but with a higher incidence and duration in animals treated with 
FTMB. The difference is not considered significant. Body weight was not affected in any group. There were no 
treatment-related findings in electrocardiography, blood pressure, ophthalmology, haematology and urinalysis. 
At blood biochemistry similar slightly higher mean urea and triglyceride levels were observed in groups treated 
with Herceptin and FTMB compared to placebo. There were no significant differences in the organ weights, 
macroscopic or microscopic changes between the Herceptin and the FTMB groups. There were no organ weight 
changes related to the administration of Herceptin or FTMB. There was a trend towards increased lymphoid 
stimulation in the popliteal lymph nodes draining the injection sites in the Herceptin and FTMB groups. There 
were no significant effects at the injection sites after injections of Herceptin or FTMB. Based on PK values, 
trastuzumab exposure can be considered similar after injection of Herceptin or FTMB. Overall the toxicology data 
indicate that ABP 980 and Herceptin can be considered comparable. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of 
the substance in the environment. Therefore, trastuzumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant used a stepwise approach in order to demonstrate that ABP 980 is comparable to Herceptin with 
respect to PD/PK and toxicity. Studies regarding safety pharmacology, reproduction toxicology, and 
carcinogenicity and on local tolerance are not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars. In line with the “3R” 
policy and the guidance given in the CHMP guidelines and on biotechnology and biosimilar products the company 
is discouraged to performing the in vivo repeat-dose toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys given also the 
limited number of animals used in this study, which limits statistical evaluation. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The overall data on PD/PK and toxicology indicate that ABP 980 can be considered similar to 
the reference product Herceptin. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacokinetics program comprised a PK similarity study conducted in healthy subjects (Study 
20130119) using a single 6-mg/kg IV dose, and the collection of PK data during the clinical similarity study in 
subjects with HER2+ EBC (Study 20120283) where ABP 980 and trastuzumab (EU) were administered at a 
single loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV, followed by maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for up to 1 year.  
A single ECL assay (electrochemiluminescence), based on the technology from MSD (Meso Scale Discovery) in 
microtiter plates, was designed to quantify ABP 980 and trastuzumab (US and EU) in human serum. A PK 
method qualification study was performed using independent standard curves of ABP 980 and US- or 
EU-sourced Herceptin. Full validation results of the single calibrator (ABP 980) method subsequently used for 
determination of trastuzumab concentration in clinical samples met the criteria of the guideline for bioanalytical 
method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). 
For Study 20130119, a total of 3059 samples were analyzed in 162 analytical runs and 159 (98%) runs met the 
method acceptance criteria. 
For Study 20120283, a total of 5969 samples were analyzed in 251 analytical runs and 228 (90.8%) runs met 
the method acceptance criteria. 
For Study 20130119 and Study 20120283, samples were evaluated for binding ADAs using a 2-tiered 
immunoassay that consisted of a screening assay and a confirmatory assay.  A validated ECL bridging 
immunoassay was used to detect antibodies capable of binding ABP 980, trastuzumab (US), or trastuzumab 
(EU). All samples positive for binding ADAs were assessed for neutralizing antibodies capable of binding to ABP 
980, trastuzumab (US), or trastuzumab (EU) using a target binding assay. 
The objective of Study 20130119 was the demonstration of PK similarity in healthy male subjects following a 
single 6-mg/kg IV dose, of ABP 980 relative to trastuzumab (US) and trastuzumab (EU), and trastuzumab (US) 
relative to trastuzumab (EU). A total of n= 50 in the ABP 980 group and n=46 in the EU-Herceptin group were 
evaluable for PK including subgroups of ca. 20% Japanese subjects. PK equivalence was assessed by AUCinf and 
Cmax (primary endpoints) calculated from noncompartmental analysis. The 90% CIs for the ratios of geometric 
means for the parameters Cmax, AUCinf, and AUClast (secondary endpoint) were fully contained within the 
standard bioequivalence criteria of 0.80 to 1.25. GM. Ratios and 90% CIs comparing ABP 980 and EU-sourced 
HERCEPTIN (PK parameter population) were: AUCinf: 1.00 [0.95, 1.06]; AUClast: 1.00 [0.95, 1.06]; Cmax: 
0.99 [0.95, 1.03]. 
In the clinical similarity study conducted in women with HER2+ EBC (Study 20120283), the dose and frequency 
of dosing were chosen in consideration of the current trastuzumab prescribing information. Investigational 
product was administered for a total of 4 cycles at a single loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV, followed by maintenance 
doses of 6 mg/kg IV infusion every 3 weeks (neoadjuvant phase). Following surgery, subjects entered the 
adjuvant phase and received investigational product (ABP 980 or trastuzumab) every 3 weeks for up to 1 year. 
Pre-infusion trough concentrations of ABP 980 and trastuzumab (EU) were measured in all randomised subjects 
(n=725) from visit 5 (baseline) through visit 9 (neoadjuvant treatment phase), and post-surgery at visit 10 
(start of adjuvant phase), 14, 18 and at the end of the study visit (EOS). To further characterise the PK of ABP 
980 compared with trastuzumab, a subset of 267 subjects (135 subjects in the ABP 980 group and 132 subjects 
in the trastuzumab group) also had an additional post-infusion serum sample collected after the fourth cycle of 
investigational product in the neoadjuvant phase (visit 8).  
When analyzed by treatment received in the neoadjuvant phase for subjects in the PK analysis population (363 
subjects in the ABP 980 group and 361 subjects in the trastuzumab group), results showed that pre-infusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 26/71 
 
  
  
trough concentrations were similar between ABP 980 and EU-Herceptin at all visits during the neoadjuvant 
phase. Geometric mean trough serum concentrations increased at each visit in each arm of the neoadjuvant 
phase, reaching 44.1 µg/mL and 44.8 µg/mL at visit 9 (pre-surgery, post dose 4) for ABP 980 and trastuzumab, 
respectively. Also steady state trough levels measured during the adjuvant phase were similar (e.g. visit 14, 
pre-dose 6 after surgery, geometric mean Ctrough: 53.5 vs. 52.8 µg/mL, respectively). For the subset of 
subjects who had additional post-infusion serum samples collected after the fourth cycle infusion in the 
neoadjuvant phase, results showed that post-infusion levels of ABP 980 and trastuzumab were comparable 
(geometric mean EoI: 160.8 and 154.9 µg/mL, respectively).  
In addition, a population PK analysis using a published population PK model (Quartino et al, 2016) and the 
observed data from Study 20120283 was performed to assess the consistency of the PK of ABP 980 with the PK 
of trastuzumab reported in the literature. The 2-compartment model structure with linear and nonlinear 
elimination, including covariate effects was deemed adequate to describe the observed concentration-time data 
for both ABP 980 and trastuzumab from Study 20120283. The type of treatment was not a significant predictor 
of key PK parameters. The estimates for all fixed and random effects parameters were highly consistent with 
reported PK parameters reported in literature. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamic data were included in the program as there are no specific, surrogate pharmacodynamic 
markers available that are considered relevant to predicting clinical outcomes for trastuzumab. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Performance and results of the PK method qualification study are considered appropriate to demonstrate 
analytical comparability between ABP 980 and trastuzumab (US and EU). The subsequent use of a single 
calibrator (ABP 980) during validation and clinical sample analysis is thus considered justified.  
Results of study 20130119 demonstrate PK equivalence in healthy male subjects between ABP 980 and 
EU-sourced Herceptin. The geometric mean exposure levels of ABP 980 and EU-Herceptin (Cmax: 135.9 and 
136.9 µg/mL; AUCinf: 34061 and 33947 µg*h/mL, respectively) were consistent with levels reported in the 
literature after single dose administration of 6 mg/kg Herceptin in healthy subjects (Wynne et al. 2012; Yin et 
al. 2014). The study population (n= 157) comprised 31 Japanese subjects. Appropriate subgroup analyses 
(Non-Japanese vs. Japanese) were performed by the Company. The 90% CIs for all comparisons (AUCinf, Cmax 
and AUClast) were within the bioequivalence criteria of 0.80 to 1.25. The overall study design and statistical 
methods for study 20130119 are considered acceptable. 
Comparison of Ctrough and EoI levels during the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phase of study 20120283 supports 
PK similarity of ABP 980 and EU-Herceptin in female patients with HER2+ EBC. Steady-state seems to have been 
reached by the time-point of Visit 14. As no supplementary PK sampling was done between Visit 10 and 14, no 
definite conclusion on the time point of reaching steady state can be drawn from this study. However, the range 
of trough levels and accumulation over time observed were as expected for Herceptin.  
ABP 980 and Herceptin treatment arms comprised 363 and 361 subjects, respectively. Baseline values are 
available for only 353 and 347 patients, respectively. N=34 subjects (N=17 per arm, i.e. 5%) had quantifiable 
baseline trastuzumab levels. Sample collection after start of infusion or pre-exposure to trastuzumab was 
excluded as possible causes. The reason for this observation is unknown. Since trough concentration profiles for 
Assessment report

Page 27/71 
 
  
  
subjects with quantifiable baseline values were consistent with those observed for other subjects, and the 
fraction of these patients was similar and not more than 5% in both treatment groups, this is accepted. 
Population PK analysis using a published population PK model for trastuzumab and the observed data from 
Study 20120283 further supported that PK of ABP 980 is highly consistent with the trastuzumab PK reported in 
the literature. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK equivalence between ABP 980 and EU-Herceptin is considered as proven. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Main study 
The pivotal efficacy trial was a randomised, double blind, active controlled clinical similarity study in adult female 
subjects with HER2+ EBC designed to compare the safety, efficacy, PK, and immunogenicity of ABP 980 with 
trastuzumab. Study 20120283 included a run in chemotherapy phase (epirubicin and cyclophosphamide), a 
neoadjuvant phase (ABP980 or trastuzumab + paclitaxel) followed by surgery and an adjuvant phase (ABP980 
or trastuzumab). Randomisation was stratified according to T stage, nodal status, hormone receptor status, 
planned paclitaxel dosing schedule, and geographic region.  
Subjects who initially received trastuzumab (EU) during the neoadjuvant phase were randomised to either 
continue receiving trastuzumab or switch to ABP 980 (single transition) during the adjuvant phase. Subjects 
who initially received ABP 980 during the neoadjuvant phase continued to receive ABP 980 during the adjuvant 
phase.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary efficacy endpoints 
• 
• 
risk difference of the incidence of pCR in breast tissue and axillary lymph nodes 
risk ratio of the incidence of pCR in breast tissue and axillary lymph nodes 
Note: pCR was defined as the absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast tissue and in axillary lymph nodes, 
regardless of residual DCIS. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
• 
• 
• 
• 
risk difference of pCR in breast tissue 
risk ratio of pCR in breast tissue 
risk difference of pCR in breast tissue and axillary lymph nodes and absence of DCIS 
risk ratio of pCR in breast tissue and axillary lymph nodes and absence of DCIS 
Note: pCR in breast was defined as the absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast tissue, regardless of 
residual DCIS and pCR without DCIS was defined as the absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast tissue and 
in axillary lymph node(s) and absence of DCIS. 
Primary and secondary endpoint assessment was conducted locally and centrally. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the pCR evaluable set (all randomised subjects that underwent 
surgery and had an evaluable pCR assessment; analysed according to actual treatment received), 3) and a 
sensitivity analysis was conducted on the ITT set (all randomised subjects) with non-responder imputation for 
patients without pCR assessment. 
The primary comparison of ABP 980 to trastuzumab (both in combination with standard of care neoadjuvant 
cancer treatment), was assessed using the co-primary efficacy endpoints, RD and RR of pCR in breast and 
axillary lymph nodes. A sequential testing method was implemented where equivalence between ABP 980 and 
trastuzumab was first assessed on the RD using a two-sided 90% confidence interval with a fixed equivalence 
margin of ± 13%. The confidence interval was derived using a generalised linear model adjusted for 
stratification factors. If successful, equivalence between ABP 980 and trastuzumab was next assessed for the RR 
using a two-sided 90% confidence interval with a fixed equivalence margin of (0.7586, 1/0.7586). For the risk 
difference a binary model with identity link was used and the log link was used for the relative risk. 
Analyses on other efficacy endpoints are regarded as descriptive. For continuous outcomes, the mean difference 
between ABP 980 and trastuzumab and its 2-sided 90% CI were estimated using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model adjusted for stratification factors and other relevant covariates, and binary outcomes were 
analysed in the same way as the co-primary endpoints.

Results 
Conduct of the study 
The number of patients with important protocol deviations is overall comparable between the treatment groups. 
Baseline data 
In the pCR evaluable population, the majority of subjects were white and not Hispanic/Latino (91.7% and 
90.4%, respectively). The mean age (SD) was 52.6 (11.0) years; the age range was from 26 to 85 years.  The 
majority of subjects had axilla lymph node involvement and had tumours that were estrogen receptor (ER) 
positive and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive at baseline (75.0% and 73.9%, respectively). The mean 
(SD) time of disease duration was 4.2 (1.9) months. Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were 
generally comparable between the 2 treatment groups, with small numerical differences in some of the 
subgroups. 
Numbers analysed 
906 patients were screened. Of those 725 received at least one dose of IP in the neoadjuvant phase. The primary 
efficacy analysis was performed on the pCR evaluable population, which included a total of 696 subjects (358 in 
the ABP 980 treatment group and 338 in the trastuzumab treatment group). 691 patients entered the adjuvant 
phase.   
9 subjects who already completed screening and run-in chemotherapy were manually randomised to the 
trastuzumab treatment arm due to a delay in manufacturing of ABP 980. These patients were not included in the 
pCR summaries or efficacy analyses (ITT population). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Co-primary endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints of the study were Risk Difference (RD) and Risk Ratio (RR) of pCR in breast tissue and 
axillary lymph nodes regardless of DCIS. According to local laboratory evaluation in the pCR evaluable 
population 172 patients (48.0%) in the ABP 980 arm achieved a pCR whereas in the trastuzumab arm the 
number of patients with pCR was 137 (40.5%). Results for pCR by central laboratory evaluation were 
comparable to these results: ABP 980 pCR = 162 patients (47.8%); trastuzumab pCR = 138 patients (41.8%). 
The RD (ABP 980/trastuzumab) was 7.3 %with a 2 sided 95% CI of (0.0, 14.6). While the lower limit of the 
confidence interval was within the pre-specified equivalence margin of ±13%, thereby ruling out non-inferiority, 
the upper limit of the confidence interval does not fall within the equivalence margin. The same applies to the 
risk ratio (RR=1.1877) with a 2 sided 95% CI of (1.0054, 1.4031). As a sequential testing strategy was 
employed, and the analysis had to be stopped in the case of not succeeding equivalence in RD, the results of the 
RR of pCR was only presented descriptively, and also for RR of pCR the upper border of the predefined margin 
(0.7585;1.3182) was crossed.  
Sensitivity analyses based on central laboratory evaluation (conducted by independent blinded pathologists) 
and additional factors are presented in the below table. For the primary analysis set (pCR evaluable population)

the upper limit of the 95% CI only barely crosses the upper equivalence margin (5.8%, /-1.7/13.2%)  while 
results from the PP and the ITT using NRI are preserved in the predefined equivalence margins (PP: 4.1%, 
-3.5/11.6% and ITT w. NRI 5.1%, -2.0/12.3%).

In breast tissue only the RD of pCR was 6.0% with a 2 sided 95% CI of (-1.3%, 13.4%); the RR of pCR was 
1.1463 with a 2-sided 95% CI of (0.9835, 1.3360). 
The RD of pCR in breast tissue only in the pCR evaluable population based on a local laboratory evaluation of the 
tumour samples was 6.0% with a 2 sided 95% CI of (-1.3%, 13.4%); the RR of pCR was 1.1463 with a 2-sided 
95% CI of (0.9835, 1.3360). Except for one value (RD in breast tissue only in the PP population) all upper limits 
of the confidence intervals for RR and RD were above the predefined equivalence margin of the primary analysis. 
Analysis by ADCC activity (NK92 assay) 
In order to investigate potential reasons why the upper border of the predefined margin was crossed, the 
Applicant provided analyses excluding patients who received trastuzumab lots with ADCC activity ≤ 60% and to 
investigate the impact of ADCC on efficacy via inclusion as covariate in the primary analysis model (see tables 
with data cut-off 26 Mar 2017 below).

The applicant provided additional analyses on non-product-related factors. Compared with the stratification 
factors included in the primary efficacy analysis, the stratification factor of T-stage (< T4 versus T4) was 
replaced with the full scale of T-stage classification, and histological grade in addition to age were added as 
baseline covariates. Results of this analysis showed that the RD of pCR was reduced from 7.3% observed in the 
primary analysis to 6.5% (90% CI: 0.4%, 12.6%; 95% CI: -0.8%, 13.8%). Additionally, the analysis based on 
central pathology review shows the 95% CI for RD of pCR (-2.4%, 12.4%) is within the pre-specified margin. 
In a supplementary analysis all subjects with average ADCC level per cycle ≤ 83% were set to missing. Three 
analyses were subsequently conducted: A complete case analysis (excluding all subjects with average ADCC ≤ 
83%), multiple imputation for the missing ADCC levels and bootstrap resampling to replace the missing ADCC 
levels. All corresponding 95% confidence intervals were contained within the pre-specified equivalence margin. 
However, the choice of the cut off (exclusion of ADCC ≤ 83%) was not justified. 
Multivariable models were estimated as part of the responses to the D180 LoOI, adjusting for ADCC and 
non-product-related factors (ie, nodal status, hormone receptor status, planned paclitaxel dosing schedule, 
geographic region, full spectrum of tumour stage, histological grade, and age). In the model without interaction 
effect for ADCC and treatment, the adjusted treatment effect (RD) was 6.8% (95% CI: -0.5%, 14.1%), i.e., the 
pre-specified margin of (-13%, 13%) was not met. A model with interaction for ADCC and treatment was also 
provided but was considered seriously flawed and not considered further.

Analysis based on ADCC-PBMC assay 
The applicant provided additional data on ADCC for trastuzumab and ABP 980 clinical lots using a PBMC 
(peripheral blood mononuclear cells) assay. This analysis identified a lower ADCC cut-point of ≤ 65% (as 
compared to the NK92 assay in the previous analysis), differentiating 71 subjects with low ADCC in the 
trastuzumab reference product arm, and provides an analysis based on a more physiologically relevant assay, 
since the PBMC ADCC assay uses donors that are heterozygous for FcγRIIIa (158V/F), as compared to the high 
affinity variant [FcγRIIIa (158V)] used in the NK92 assay. FcγRIIIa (158F) carriers were recently shown to more 
potently mediate ADCC as compared to FcγRIIIa (158V/V) carriers in breast cancer patients (Boero et al, 2015), 
therefore supporting that PBMC ADCC assay is more physiologically relevant as both genetic variants are 
represented. 
The analytical similarity data demonstrate the following: 
• mean ADCC by PBMC of all trastuzumab (EU) lots is 83% 
• mean ADCC by PBMC of pre-shift trastuzumab (EU) lots is 93%, and mean of ADCC post-shift trastuzumab 
(EU) lots is 63% 
• mean ADCC by PBMC of all ABP 980 lots is 99% 
71 subjects in the trastuzumab treatment group (pCR evaluable population) were exposed to at least one 
treatment that included a trastuzumab lot having ADCC levels ≤ 65% in the neoadjuvant phase of the clinical 
similarity study. The analysis was performed on the pCR evaluable population using both local and central 
laboratory evaluations of the tumour samples.

Ancillary analyses 
Several subgroup analyses have been conducted by the Applicant to give an estimate whether comparable 
results in similarity assessment are achieved across various groups compared to the whole dataset. These 
results provide an impression, are however hard to interpret, since numbers of patients are overall too small and 
variability too large to allow for confirmatory assessment. A higher pCR activity for KANJINTI seemed more 
pronounced in Hormone receptor negative patients, patients with tumour stage 4, and patients older than 50. 
These results should however, as indicated above, be interpreted with caution and not be regarded as 
confirmatory.

Notes 
Pre-defined equivalence margins were for RD ±13% and for RR (0.7586, 
1.3182). The SAP only foresaw 90% confidence intervals to evaluate 
equivalence, i.e., the presented analyses are supportive only. 
Prespecified sensitivity analyses were performed based on a local and a 
central laboratory evaluation of tumour samples on the PP population and the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population using nonresponder imputation. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Development of the biosimilar candidate ABP 980 (trastuzumab) in terms of clinical efficacy is based on a single 
pivotal phase III clinical trial in patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 20120283 was a randomised, double blind, active controlled clinical similarity study in adult female 
subjects with HER2+ EBC with 3 phases which included a run-in chemotherapy phase (4 cycles of epirubicin and 
cyclophosphamide Q3W) followed by 4 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment (Q3W) with paclitaxel plus either 
ABP980 or trastuzumab. After surgery patients treated with the reference product were 1:1 randomised to 
either continue with Herceptin or switch to ABP 980. Treatment was received up to 1 year. The focus of the 
adjuvant phase was particularly to gain long-term data for safety and immunogenicity. For this procedure, the 
focus in the adjuvant phase was put on the ABP 980 and the trastuzumab only group, since switching and 
interchangeability is outside the remit of this MA procedure.  At time of data cut-off all patients have completed 
the neoadjuvant phase. Hence data for the primary and secondary endpoints are complete. 221 patients are still 
ongoing in the adjuvant setting.

The chosen trial design has been discussed in a CHMP scientific advice. The clinical setting, as well as the 
indications were deemed acceptable. Risk difference and risk ratio of pCR was agreed upon as sensitive 
surrogate endpoint. Solely, the definition of pCR and whether DCIS should be included was issue of discussion. 
The Applicant chose the definition of pCR rate in breast and axillary nodes regardless of DCIS as primary 
endpoint. This was accepted by CHMP owing to the fact that the secondary endpoints included the same 
endpoint but in the absence of DCIS. 
Primary and secondary endpoint assessment was conducted locally and centrally and did not reveal major 
deviations. 
As discussed in the EMA scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/2033/1/FU/3/2012/II), calculation of a 13% equivalence 
margin of RD in pCR rate was based on the NOAH study, where a difference in pCR rate between chemo + 
trastuzumab vs chemo alone of 19% could be observed. The validity of the margin “relies on the ‘constancy’ 
assumption being valid (that results of the NOAH study are applicable to the setting of this prospective study) 
and this assumption should be addressed in any MAA”. The statistical rationale for the equivalence margin was 
mainly based on interactions with regulatory agencies and chosen for pragmatic reasons. 
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were relatively balanced between the treatment groups. 
Nine subjects who already completed screening and run-in chemotherapy were manually randomised to the 
trastuzumab treatment arm due to a delay in manufacturing of ABP 980. These patients were not included in the 
pCR summaries or efficacy analyses (ITT population). 
Discontinuation of subjects during the neoadjuvant phase (without surgery) was rare (6 vs 14 subjects with ABP 
980 and Trastuzumab, respectively) with slightly more subjects withdrawing consent in the reference treatment 
arm (5 vs 2), but regarding the low discontinuation rate this is considered negligible. 96.4% vs. 90.9% of 
subjects were included in the PP population for pCR evaluation. Fourteen subjects (1.9%) discontinued study 
after surgery and before entering the adjuvant phase (N=9; 2.5% with ABP 980 and N=5; 1.4% with 
Trastuzumab), again observed imbalances were not considered meaningful. The most common type of deviation 
was misstratification in IXRS (61 subjects [8.4%]). Nearly 70% of the misstratification concerned the Nodal 
status, further categories were tumour classification (~20%) and paclitaxel dosing schedule (~10%).  
It seems however plausible that the misstratifications regarding nodal status and probably tumour classification 
could not be anticipated at time of randomisation and only became apparent after surgery. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The proportion of patients achieving pCR in the ABP980 group was 47.3%. For the pCR evaluable population the 
RD (ABP 980/trastuzumab) was 7.3 % with a 2 sided 95% CI of (0.0, 14.6). While the lower limit of the 
confidence interval was within the pre-specified equivalence margin of ±13%, thereby ruling out non-inferiority, 
the upper limit of the confidence interval does not fall within the equivalence margin. The same applies to the 
risk ratio (RR=1.1877) with a 2 sided 95% CI of (1.0054, 1.4031) as well as to the secondary endpoints (except 
for RD in breast tissue only in the PP population).  
The applicant provided sensitivity analysis based on central laboratory evaluation, which was conducted by 
independent blinded pathologists, as opposed to the predefined local evaluation. In principle this can be 
considered justifiable, however, this was not the predefined primary analysis. A certain number of patients were 
excluded from the central evaluation, with a bigger gap being observed in the ABP 980 arm (19 in ABP 980, 8 In 
EU Herceptin) due to inadequate pCR samples. The applicant was asked to provide detailed reasons for this 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 41/71 
 
  
  
exclusion. Regarding the observed results for centrally analysed samples, it was concluded that 
inter-pathologist variability (local 123 sites, central: 2 reader paradigm) rather than the evaluation of different 
slides contributed to the more similar results for centrally analysed samples and that the discordance between 
local and central laboratories did not have a meaningful impact on the study results. 
Shifts in ADCC activity that have been observed for some Herceptin lots used in study 20120283 could have 
contributed to the reasons why the primary endpoint in study 20120283 was not met. Since ADCC is one of the 
known mechanisms of action affecting trastuzumab efficacy, the higher variability in ADCC activity in the 
Herceptin lots could have contributed to a wider CI that slightly exceeded the upper equivalence margin. In 
general, a downward shift in ADCC-related attributes was observed in some Herceptin lots. A concurrent 
downward shift in afucosylation, afucosylated galactosylation, and galactosylation was observed in the same 
lots that also demonstrated lower FcγRIIIa binding, which is expected based on the structure-function 
relationship. Therefore additional analyses for ADCC activity measured by PBMCs as effector cells were 
conducted. 
Taking all data, ADCC activity, glycan structure and expiration date into account, a cut- off value of 65% for the 
further analyses was considered justified. 71 subjects were identified which received the trastuzumab reference 
product with lower ADCC activity if applying the cut point of 65%. The risk difference of pCR between the 
treatment groups was reduced to 4.4% when excluding subjects exposed to at least one trastuzumab with ADCC 
activity levels ≤65%. 
In addition, small imbalances in baseline characteristics were observed between subjects in the 2 treatment 
arms regarding the histological grade of tumours (more subjects with lower grade tumours were randomised to 
ABP 980) and tumour stage (within the < T4 stratum, more subjects had T1 or T2 tumours in the ABP 980 
group). Initially performed subgroup analyses, including T-stage (< T4 vs T4) did not reveal any influence. 
However, when adding histological grade as stratification factor and using the full T-staging instead of T-stage 
<T4 vs T4, the observed RD between trastuzumab and ABP 980 was reduced. By additionally using central 
laboratory assessments, the RD could be further reduced and the primary endpoint was met as the 95% 
confidence interval for RD was entirely contained within the pre-specified margin of (-13%, 13%). 
Event free survival and overall survival data were similar between the treatment groups although it has to be 
noted that data were immature at time of submission. 
Taking the provided analyses regarding the clinical efficacy into account, and considering the totality of the data, 
the residual uncertainty does not question the biosimilarity between Kanjinti and Herceptin. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In view of the totality of the evidence similarity between Kanjinti and Herceptin in terms of efficacy is considered 
sufficiently established. 
Regarding extrapolation of all indications approved for the reference product Herceptin, scientific evidence are 
indicating that the mechanism of action of trastuzumab is similar in different target conditions in both early and 
metastatic breast cancer (HER2-positive), as well as HER2-positive gastric cancer. Hence, extrapolation to the 
non-studied oncology indications is considered acceptable. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data are derived from 2 ABP 980 clinical studies:

subjects with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer (EBC) (data 
cut-off 05 May 2016) 
For both studies, the safety analyses were performed on the safety analysis set that included all subjects who 
received any amount of investigational product. Safety findings presented in this marketing application include 
safety data for a total of 882 subjects:  585 subjects who received ABP 980 and 468 who received trastuzumab. 
With the responses to the D120 List of Questions the Applicant submitted updated safety, immunogenicity and 
PK data with a data cut-off on 29 Mar 2017.

Study 20120283 
In the neoadjuvant phase all 725 subjects who were randomised received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product (364 and 361 subjects in the ABP 980 and trastuzumab arms, respectively).  In general, the total 
exposure was similar in the 2 treatment arms during the neoadjuvant phase, with 357 (98.1%) and 352 subjects 
(97.5%) in the ABP 980 and trastuzumab arms, respectively, receiving 4 doses of investigational product, and 
a median average weight-based dose administered of 6.50 mg/kg in both arms. The mean (SD) cumulative total 
dose of investigational product administered in the neoadjuvant phase was 1872.4 (404.1) mg for subjects in 
the ABP 980 group and 1874.6 (380.1) mg for subjects in the trastuzumab group. For subjects receiving 
paclitaxel every 3 weeks, the mean (SD) cumulative total dose was 685.8 (65.2) mg/m2 for subjects in the ABP 
980 group and 678.7 (83.0) mg/m2 for subjects in the trastuzumab group.  
At the time of data cut-off a total of 691 subjects had received at least 1 dose of investigational product in the 
adjuvant phase:  349 in the ABP 980/ABP 980 group, 171 in the trastuzumab/trastuzumab group, and 171 in the 
trastuzumab/ABP 980 group.  As of the data cut-off, the number of doses administered ranged from 1 dose to 
13 doses. The mean (SD) cumulative total dose of investigational product administered in the adjuvant phase

was 5165.3 (1334.8) mg for subjects in the ABP 980/ABP 980 group, 5259.2 (1208.9) mg for subjects in the 
trastuzumab/trastuzumab group, and 5286.5 (1371.3) mg for subjects in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group.  
Study 20130119 
Subjects received investigational product as a single IV dose of 6 mg/kg; a total of 50, 52, and 55 subjects were 
exposed to a single dose of 6 mg/kg IV ABP 980, trastuzumab (US), and trastuzumab (EU), respectively. 
Adverse events 
Study 20130119 
79.0% of subjects overall reported at least 1 adverse event.  Most adverse events were assessed as grade 1 or 
grade 2 in severity.  There were no grade 4 or grade 5 events and no deaths.  A total of 6 serious adverse events 
were reported for 2 subjects (1.3%).  Adverse events leading to investigational product discontinuation were 
reported for 1 subject (0.6%). 
Adverse events reported for more than 5% of subjects in any treatment group were headache, upper respiratory 
tract infection, chills, pyrexia, myalgia, nausea, epistaxis, arthralgia, and lethargy.  Treatment emergent 
adverse events that were grade ≥ 3 occurred in 1 subject (secondary to a motor bike accident) in the 
trastuzumab (US) treatment group and 1 subject (events of infusion related reaction and headache; probably 
related to study drug) in the trastuzumab (EU) treatment group. 
Study 20120283 
Neoadjuvant phase 
79.9% of subjects overall reported at least 1 treatment emergent adverse event, the incidence (292 [80.2%] 
and 287 [79.5%] in the ABP 980 and trastuzumab arms, respectively) and severity (54 (14.8%) and 51 subjects 
(14.1%) experienced CTCAE grade ≥ 3 adverse events) were similar between the ABP 980 and trastuzumab 
treatment groups.  The subject incidence of any EOI in the ABP 980 and trastuzumab treatment groups was 
43.1% and 40.7%, respectively. Treatment emergent adverse events were fatal in the neoadjuvant phase for 1 
subject in the ABP 980 group and 0 subjects in the trastuzumab group. 
Treatment emergent adverse events were most frequently reported from the nervous system disorders and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders system organ class (SOC). The largest difference (> 5%) 
between the treatment groups has been observed in the SOC „Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” 
(ABP 980:10.4% [n=38] vs. trastuzumab: 4.7% [n=17]). The majority of these events were Grade 1 and grade 
2 with epistaxis (only grade 1) being the most frequent PT. Events of arthralgia and asthenia were the treatment 
emergent adverse events reported most frequently (17.3% and 15.2% in the ABP 980 and trastuzumab groups, 
respectively, for arthralgia; and 14.8% and 16.3%, respectively, for asthenia).  The proportion of subjects who 
experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent adverse events in either treatment group was similar (14.8% in the 
ABP 980 group and 14.1% in the trastuzumab group).  The most common grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent 
adverse event was neutropenia. 
120 patients experienced 280 IP-related adverse events: 60 patients [n=16.5%] with 116 events in the ABP 
group and 60 patients [n=16.6%] with 164 events in the trastuzumab group.

Adjuvant phase 
Most subjects experienced at least 1 treatment emergent adverse event at the time of data cutoff (26 Mar 
2017), the incidence was comparable across the ABP 980/ABP 980 (61.6%) and trastuzumab/ABP 980 group 
(63.2%) whereas in the trastuzumab only group a lower number of AEs was reported (56.1%). The number of 
serious adverse events, adverse events of interest and adverse events leading to discontinuation were higher in 
the ABP 980 only group compared to the other groups. Treatment emergent adverse events were fatal in the 
adjuvant phase for 1 subject in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group and 0 subjects in the ABP 980/ABP 980 and 
trastuzumab/trastuzumab groups. 
Treatment emergent adverse events were most frequently reported from the injury, poisoning, and procedural 
complications SOC. There was ≥5% difference between one or more of the treatment groups in the SOCs of 
Infections and Infestations (15.5% for ABP 980/ABP 980, 9,9% for trastuzumab/trastuzumab, and 13.5% for 
trastuzumab/ABP 980), Nervous System Disorders (13.5%, 7.0%, and 8.8%, respectively), and 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (10.9%, 4.1%, and 6.4%, respectively). Events of radiation skin injury and 
neutropenia were the treatment emergent adverse events reported most frequently (10.6%, 9.9% and 9.4% in 
the ABP 980/ABP 980, trastuzumab/trastuzumab, and trastuzumab/ABP 980 groups, respectively, for radiation 
skin injury; and 7.2%, 5.8%, and 3.5%, respectively, for neutropenia).  The proportion of subjects who 
experienced grade ≥3 treatment emergent adverse events in the 3 treatment groups was 8.6%, 6.4%, and 
7.6%, respectively. The most common grade ≥3 treatment emergent adverse events were hypertension, 
neutropenia and gamma glutamyltransferase increased.  
109 patients experienced 252 IP-related adverse events: 59 patients [n=16.9%] with 137 events in the ABP 
only group, 24 patients [n=14.0%] with 54 events in the trastuzumab only group and 26 patients [n=15.9%] 
with 61 events in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group.

Data were presented on the three SOCs considered to most significantly impact the overall adverse events: 
nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and infections and infestations. 
Nervous System Disorders 
In review of adverse events by Nervous System Disorder SOC, the most commonly reported adverse events by 
preferred term (PT) causing the numerical imbalance in the overall rate were headache, dizziness, and 
peripheral neuropathy. Each of these PTs were classified as CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. With respect to relatedness, 
headache was reported as related for 1.1% for ABP 980 vs 0.6% for trastuzumab, dizziness was reported as 
related for 0.3% for ABP 980 and 0 for trastuzumab, and peripheral neuropathy was reported as related for 
0.6% for ABP 980 vs 0 for trastuzumab. The subject incidence reported for each of these events was below the 
historical trastuzumab data reported in the Herceptin SmPC. Adverse events of headache, dizziness, and 
peripheral neuropathy are listed as very common (≥ 1/10) or common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) undesirable effects 
of trastuzumab (Herceptin Summary of Product Characteristics, April 2017). Additionally, neuropathy (including 
peripheral neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, paresthesia, and hypoesthesia) is an adverse reaction 
associated with the use of paclitaxel, known to have a late time to onset; therefore, the events of neuropathy 
observed in the adjuvant phase could have been manifestations of a neurologic process that started during or 
following the neoadjuvant phase. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
In review of adverse events by Gastrointestinal Disorder SOC, the most commonly reported adverse events by 
preferred term in this SOC causing the numerical imbalance in the overall rate were nausea, diarrhea, and 
abdominal pain. Each of these PTs were classified as CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. With respect to relatedness to IP, only 
nausea was considered related (0.9% for ABP 980 vs 0.6% for trastuzumab) and none of the events within 
diarrhea or abdominal pain AEs were considered related to treatment. Adverse events of nausea, diarrhea, and 
abdominal pain are listed as very common (≥ 1/10) undesirable effects of trastuzumab (Herceptin Summary of 
Product Characteristics, April 2017). The subject incidence reported for each of these events was below the 
historical trastuzumab data reported in the Herceptin® SmPC. 
Infections and Infestations 
In review of adverse events by Infections and Infestations SOC, the most commonly reported adverse event by 
preferred term in this SOC causing the numerical imbalance in the overall rate were upper respiratory tract 
infection, nasopharyngitis, and influenza. Each of these PTs were classified as CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. With respect 
to relatedness to IP, none of the events were considered related to treatment. Adverse events of upper 
respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and influenza are listed as very common (≥ 1/10) undesirable 
effects of trastuzumab (Herceptin Summary of Product Characteristics, April 2017). The subject incidence 
reported for each of these events was below the historical trastuzumab data reported in the Herceptin SmPC. 
Safety data based on ADCC 
The applicant provided additional safety data from the adjuvant phase separate for trastuzumab with and 
without low ADCC batches by NK92 ADCC assay and PBMC assay, respectively. The number of subjects in the 
Safety Analysis Population exposed to the low ADCC lots within each phase of the clinical study is provided 
below:

Exclusion of subjects based on ADCC NK92 assay  
A total of 60 subjects have received four low ADCC lots, as determined by the NK92 assay, within the adjuvant 
phase of the clinical similarity study. Please refer to Table 2 for the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
summary table on the requested analyses based on exclusion of these subjects. Please also note that all of the 
above-referenced four lots had the expiry date after August 2018, considered “post-shift” batches. The 
incidence of any TEAEs in the ABP 980 group was 61.6%, compared to 60.4% in the trastuzumab arm excluding 
subjects who have received the low ADCC lots. When comparing within the trastuzumab arms, the incidence 
within the sub-group of subjects never exposed to low ADCC lots was 60.4% vs 48.3% for subjects exposed to 
low ADCC lots, suggesting the possibility that subjects receiving trastuzumab with lower ADCC may have 
reduced the overall adverse event rate experienced in that treatment group. Subsequent assessment of safety 
data by ADCC exposure at a more granular level for specific adverse events is challenged by the low overall rates 
within each category.

Phase (Safety Analysis Population) 
Exclusion of Subjects Based on ADCC PBMC Assay  
Please refer to Table 3 for safety analyses excluding 66 subjects who have received low ADCC lots during the 
adjuvant phase, as determined by the PBMC assay. When comparing any TEAEs in the ABP 980 group (61.6%) 
to the trastuzumab group excluding the subjects exposed to low ADCC lots (58.1%), no meaningful difference 
is observed. When assessing the potential impact of low ADCC on safety within the trastuzumab group, the rate 
of TEAEs for subjects who have never received low ADCC lots is 58.1% vs 53.0% for subjects who have received

low ADCC lots. This analysis is consistent with the above exclusion based on the NK92 ADCC assay, suggesting 
the possibility of a correlation between ADCC exposure and the incidence of adverse events. 
Adjuvant Phase (Safety Analysis Population) 
Exclusion of Subjects Based on Expiry  
A total of four trastuzumab lots were identified with expiration date after August 2018, which are the same 4 lots 
identified based on low ADCC lots, as determined by the ADCC NK92 assay. Overall, 60 subjects received the 
post-August 2018 lots within the adjuvant phase of the clinical study. Please refer to Table 2 for the safety 
analysis excluding these subjects. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study 20130119 
A total of 6 serious adverse events were reported in 2 subjects (events of tibia fracture, ligament injury, and 
joint dislocation [all secondary to a motor bike accident]; and deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism 
[following surgery for external fixation] in 1 subject in the trastuzumab [US] treatment group; and 1 event of 
infusion related reaction in 1 subject in the trastuzumab [EU] treatment group).  No fatal treatment-emergent 
adverse events occurred. 
Study 20120283 
SAEs in neoadjuvant phase 
Serious adverse events occurred in 4.9% of subjects (18 subjects) in the ABP 980 treatment group and 1.4% of 
subjects (5 subjects) in the trastuzumab treatment group. The most frequently reported SOCs were Infections 
and Infestations; Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications; and Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders.  
Febrile neutropenia was the preferred term reported most frequently (3 subjects in the ABP 980 group and 0

subjects in the trastuzumab group) followed by pneumonia which was reported as grade 3 in 1 subject and grade 
5 in 1 subject; all other serious events by preferred term were reported in single subjects in either treatment 
group.  The incidence of treatment related serious adverse events due to investigational product was balanced 
between the 2 treatment groups (0.8% of subjects [3 subjects] and 0.6% of subjects [2 subjects] in the ABP 980 
and trastuzumab groups, respectively).   
SAEs in adjuvant Phase 
Serious adverse events occurred in 5.2% of subjects (18 subjects) in the ABP 980/ABP 980 group, 3.5% of 
subjects (6 subjects) in the trastuzumab/trastuzumab group, and 3.5% of subjects (6 subjects) in the 
trastuzumab/ABP 980 group.  All events were reported in a single subject in a single treatment group with the 
exception of radiation pneumonitis, which was reported in 1 subject each in the trastuzumab/trastuzumab and 
trastuzumab/ABP 980 groups, and pneumonia, which was reported in 2 subjects in the 
trastuzumab/trastuzumab group. By relatedness, only a single subject in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 treatment 
group experienced a serious adverse event possibly related to investigational product (ventricular 
extrasystoles). 
Deaths 
6 subjects died on study, including 2 subjects who died from treatment emergent adverse events (ie, events 
that occurred within 30 days after the last dose of investigational product) and 3 subjects who died from events 
that occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of investigational product.   
Three deaths were reported in the neoadjuvant phase:  
• 
pneumonia (ABP 980) 
•  Metastases to the brain (two events in the trastuzumab group) 
Three deaths were reported in the adjuvant phase both in the trastuzumab/ABP 980: 
• 
• 
septic shock (patient with ECOG 3 in wheelchair and respiratory failure prior to Grade 5 event) 
pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (tested positive for HIV) 
•  Metastases to bone, liver, lungs and adrenal glands 
None of these deaths were considered related to the investigational medicinal product. 
Adverse events of interest  
Study 20120283 
EOIs were defined as noteworthy events for a particular product or class of products that a sponsor may wish to 
monitor carefully. The prespecified EOIs were derived based on the mechanism of action and clinical data 
available in product labelling for trastuzumab. The prespecified EOIs for this study included:  cardiac failure, 
neutropenia, infusion reaction, hypersensitivity, pulmonary toxicity, and infections and infestations. The 
incidence of EOIs was also summarised in patient years of exposure (the exposure adjusted incidence rate per 
100 patient years) and by drug exposure over the entire study.

Neoadjuvant phase 
In the neoadjuvant phase a slightly higher percentage of patients in ABP 980 group experienced an “all grade 
EOI” (43.1% and 40.7% for ABP 980 and trastuzumab, respectively). A similar situation can be seen in case of 
Infusion reaction (21.7% versus 18.8% for ABP 980 and trastuzumab, respectively) and for neutropenia (19.0% 
versus 15.8% for ABP 980 and trastuzumab, respectively). The most frequently reported EOIs grade ≥ 3 were 
neutropenia (5.8% and 5.8% of subjects in the ABP 980 and trastuzumab groups, respectively), infusion 
reaction (1.9% and 1.9% of subjects, respectively), and infections and infestations (1.9% and 0.6% of subjects, 
respectively).

Adjuvant Phase 
In the adjuvant phase the overall difference in incidence of all grade EOIs is higher between ABP 980/ABP980 
and trastuzumab/trastuzumab: 32.7% versus 25.1%, respectively. Additionally the incidence rate of infections 
and infestations is higher for ABP 980 arm (15.5% versus 9.9%, ABP 980 and trastuzumab/trastuzumab, 
respectively). The most frequently reported EOIs grade ≥ 3 were infections and infestations (1.1%, 1.2%, and 
1.2% of subjects in the ABP 980/ABP 980, trastuzumab/trastuzumab, and trastuzumab/ABP 980 groups, 
respectively), neutropenia (0.9%, 1.2%, and 0.6% of subjects, respectively), and infusion reactions (0.6%, 
1.2%, and 1.8% of subjects, respectively). 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates 
The overall summary of exposure-adjusted incidence rates for EOIs indicate that EOIs (any EOI and especially 
Infusion reaction and Infections and infestations) show a slightly higher trend towards a higher incidence rate in 
APB 980 group as in trastuzumab.

Events of Interest– Entire Study (Safety Analysis Population) 
Events of interest 
• 
Infusion Reaction EOIs  
Neoadjuvant phase: 79 [21.7%] subjects and 68 [18.8%] subjects in the ABP 980 and trastuzumab groups, 
respectively experienced an infusion reaction. Overall, 18 (4.9%) subjects in the ABP 980 group and 10 (2.8%) 
subjects in the trastuzumab group had EOIs that occurred on the day of or the day after the first day of 
treatment with investigational product. The frequency of investigational product-related infusion reaction EOIs 
was 13 [3.6%] subjects and 12 [3.3%] subjects] in the ABP 980 and trastuzumab groups, respectively 
Adjuvant phase: Infusion reaction EOIs were serious for 1 (0.6%) subject in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group 
(grade 4 respiratory failure).  One subject (0.6%) in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group experienced an infusion 
reaction EOI that was grade 4 (serious event of respiratory failure). There were no grade 5 infusion reaction 
EOIs. The frequency of investigational product-related infusion reaction EOIs was 10 [2.9%] subjects, 4 [2.3%] 
subjects, and 2 [1.2%] subjects in the ABP 980/ABP 980, trastuzumab/trastuzumab, and trastuzumab/ABP 980 
groups, respectively. 
• 
Hypersensitivity EOIs   
Neoadjuvant phase: Hypersensitivity EOIs were grade 3 for 2 (0.5%) subjects in the ABP 980 group (rash and 
hypersensitivity) and 2 (0.6%) subjects in the trastuzumab group (rash and drug hypersensitivity).  There were 
no grade 4 or grade 5 hypersensitivity EOIs.  With respect to the grade 3 hypersensitivity EOIs, all were 
assessed as related to paclitaxel and not related to investigational product. The frequency of investigational 
product-related hypersensitivity EOIs was 6 [1.6%] subjects and 3 [0.8%] subjects in the ABP 980 and 
trastuzumab groups, respectively. 
Adjuvant phase: No hypersensitivity EOIs were serious and all were grade 1 or 2. The frequency of 
investigational product-related hypersensitivity EOIs was 4 [1.1%] subjects, 2 (1.2%), and 0 (0.0%) in the ABP 
980/ABP 980, trastuzumab/trastuzumab, and trastuzumab/ABP 980 groups, respectively. 
• 
Neutropenia EOIs 
During the neoadjuvant phase, neutropenia EOIs were grade 4 for 5 (1.4%) subjects in the ABP 980 group and 
6 (1.7%) subjects in the trastuzumab group.  During the adjuvant phase, neutropenia EOIs were grade 4 for 1 
(0.3%) subject in the ABP 980/ABP 980 group and 0 subjects in the trastuzumab/trastuzumab and 
trastuzumab/ABP 980 groups.  There were no grade 5 neutropenia EOIs. (Cut-off 05 May 2016)

• 
Infections and Infestations EOIs   
Neoadjuvvant phase: Infections and infestations EOIs were serious for 6 (1.6%) subjects in the ABP 980 group 
and 1 (0.3%) subject in the trastuzumab groups.  Infections and infestations EOIs were grade 5 for 1 (0.3%) 
subject in the ABP 980 group (pneumonia) and 0 subjects in the trastuzumab group.   
Adjuvant phase: 15.5% (n=54), 9.9% (n=17) and 13.5% (n=23) patients experienced infections and 
infestations EOI in the ABP980 only, trastuzumab only and in the trastuzumab/ABP980 group, respectively. 
Infections and infestations EOIs were grade 5 for 1 (0.6%) subject in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group (septic 
shock) and for 0 subjects in the ABP 980/ABP 980 and trastuzumab/trastuzumab groups. 
• 
Cardiac Failure EOIs   
Neoadjuvant phase:  All 7 subjects with cardiac failure EOIs were older than 50 years of age.  Of the 6 subjects 
with cardiac failure EOIs in the ABP 980 treatment group, 3 subjects had relevant ongoing medical history of 
cardiac disease that may have contributed to cardiac failure EOIs.  The subject in the trastuzumab group with a 
cardiac failure EOI also had relevant ongoing medical history of cardiac disease that may have contributed to the 
cardiac failure EOI.  All 7 subjects underwent surgery and either completed all planned doses of investigational 
product or were ongoing in the study at the time of the data cutoff.  There were no relevant LVEF findings 
following the cardiac failure EOIs for 6 of the 7 subjects, indicating resolution or no worsening of the cardiac 
failure EOIs.  No cardiac failure EOIs were serious and all were grade 1 or 2. 
Adjuvant phase: During the adjuvant phase, 2 (0.6%), 1 (0.6%), and 1 subjects (0.6%) in the ABP 980/ ABP 
980, trastuzumab/trastuzumab, and trastuzumab/ABP 980, respectively, had at least 1 cardiac failure event. 
One subject in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 arm had a cardiac failure event of grade 3, and all others were grade 
1 or 2. Only 1 subject (0.6%) in the trastuzumab/trastuzumab arm (Subject 28364008004) had a cardiac failure 
event that was coincident with LVEF decline by ≥ 10 percentage points compared to baseline and to < 50%.  
• 
Pulmonary toxicity EOIs   
Neoadjuvant phase: No pulmonary toxicity EOIs were serious and all were grade 1 or 2.   
Adjuvant phase: During the adjuvant phase, 4 (1.1%), 2 (1.2%), and 1 subjects (0.6%) in the ABP 980/ABP 
980, trastuzumab/trastuzumab, and trastuzumab/ABP 980 arms, respectively, had at least 1 pulmonary toxicity 
event. The events were radiation pneumonitis (2 [0.6%] (Grade 1 and 2), 1 [0.6%] (Grade 3), and 1 subjects 
[0.6%] (Grade 3), respectively), pneumonitis (1 subject [0.3%] in the ABP 980/ABP 980 arm (Grade 1), 
pulmonary fibrosis (1 subject [0.3%] in the ABP 980/ABP 980 arm (Grade 2)), and interstitial lung disease (1 
subject [0.6%] in the trastuzumab/trastuzumab arm (Grade 2)). 
Immunological events 
The immunogenicity of ABP 980 and trastuzumab was assessed in both clinical trials by measuring the ADA 
levels using a validated 2-tiered approach that included a screening assay and a confirmatory assay. 
Study 20120283 
In study 20120283 the blood samples were collected prior to dosing on day 1, at scheduled time points during 
the study, and at the end of the study. 
Neoadjuvant phase 
A total of 723 subjects (363 in the ABP 980 treatment group and 360 in the trastuzumab treatment group) had 
at least one on-study ADA result. Three (0.9%) subjects in the trastuzumab group tested positive for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 53/71 
 
  
  
pre-existing binding ADAs at baseline, and no subjects in either group tested positive for neutralizing ADAs. 
Postbaseline, 2 (0.6%) subjects in each treatment group (ABP 980 and trastuzumab) with negative or no result 
at baseline tested positive for binding ADAs; for both of the subjects in the ABP 980 group, the results were 
transient (ie, negative results at the subject’s last time point tested within the study period).  No subjects in 
either treatment group developed neutralizing ADAs during the neoadjuvant phase. 
Adjuvant phase 
Seven (1.0%) subjects (2 [0.6%] in the ABP 980/ABP 980 treatment group, 2 [1.2%] in the 
trastuzumab/trastuzumab treatment group, and 3 [1.8%] in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 treatment group) tested 
positive for pre-existing binding ADAs before the first investigational product dose in the adjuvant phase, and no 
subjects in any group tested positive for neutralizing ADAs.  One subject (0.7%) in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 
treatment group developed binding ADAs during the adjuvant phase (ie, subject was binding ADA positive 
during the adjuvant phase with a negative or no result before the adjuvant phase), but the result was transient 
(ie, the ADA result was negative at the subject’s last time point tested within the study period).  No subjects 
developed neutralizing ADAs.   
Study 20130119 
In the study 21030119 (PK similarity) blood samples were collected prior to dosing and at the end of the study. 
There were no pre-existing binding ADAs detected in the baseline samples, and no subjects had a positive 
binding ADA test at the end of the study. 
On study Event free Survival 
On study EFS is based on a total of 37 events.  The percentage of subjects with disease progression, recurrence, 
or death was 5.5% in the ABP 980/ABP 980 treatment group, 5.8% in the trastuzumab/trastuzumab treatment 
group, and 3.5% in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 treatment group.  The median EFS (months) had not been 
reached for any treatment group at the time of the primary analysis.  The estimated hazard ratio from a 
stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model was 0.9969 (90% CI: 0.5340, 1.8612) for ABP 980/ABP 
980 versus trastuzumab/trastuzumab and 0.5414 (90% CI: 0.2207, 1.3282) for trastuzumab/ABP 980 versus 
trastuzumab/trastuzumab. 
Overall Survival 
Overall, 6 subjects (0.8%) died on study, 1 (0.3%), 2 (1.1%), and 3 (1.8%) in the ABP 980/ABP 980, 
trastuzumab/trastuzumab, and trastuzumab/ABP 980 treatment groups, respectively.  Of these, 2 were 
considered treatment emergent adverse events, because they occurred within 30 days after the last dose of 
investigational product. 
Laboratory findings 
There was no notable difference between the treatment groups with regards to hematology and chemistry 
laboratory parameters. There were no clinically relevant median changes from baseline in pulse rate, systolic 
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and weight overall, or based on treatment received in the neoadjuvant 
phase or treatment received in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant phases.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study 20130119 
1 subject (trastuzumab [EU]) discontinued investigational product prior to receiving the entire infusion due to 
adverse events of headache, infusion related reaction, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and chills.  The events 
were reported as resolved at later timepoints on the same day as initial occurrence. 
Study 20120283 
Neoadjuvant phase 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of investigational product was 
0.8% (3 subjects) in the ABP 980 treatment group and 0.6% (2 subjects) in the trastuzumab treatment group; 
the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of paclitaxel was 2.2% (8 
subjects) and 4.2% (15 subjects), respectively.  All adverse events leading to discontinuation of investigational 
product occurred in single subjects in either treatment group.  In the ABP 980 and trastuzumab treatment 
groups, events of peripheral sensory neuropathy (0.5% and 0.3%, respectively), peripheral neuropathy (0.3% 
and 0.8%, respectively), and toxic neuropathy (0.0% and 0.6%, respectively) were among the most commonly 
occurring adverse events leading to discontinuation of paclitaxel. 
Adjuvant Phase 
The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of investigational product was 
2.0% (7 subjects) in the ABP 980/ABP 980 treatment group, 1.8% (3 subjects) in the trastuzumab/trastuzumab 
treatment group, and 2.3% (4 subjects) in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 treatment group.  The only adverse event 
leading to discontinuation of investigational product in more than a single subject in any treatment group was 
metastases to the central nervous system occurring in 2 subjects in the ABP 980/ABP 980 treatment group and 
1 subject in the trastuzumab/trastuzumab group. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data are derived from two clinical studies: the completed phase 1 study in healthy subjects (20130119) 
and the ongoing phase 3 study in patients with early breast cancer (20120283). 
Study 20130119 
A total of 105 patients (ABP 980: 50 patients; trastuzumab (EU): 55 patients) were included in the safety 
dataset. Overall, the safety findings were comparable between the ABP 980 group and the trastuzumab (EU) 
group. However, the reported incidence rate of “any adverse event” was slightly lower in the reference product 
(EU) arm as in ABP 980 (78.2% versus 84.2 %, respectively). This difference is mainly driven by differences in 
two kind of AEs, namely myalgia and arthralgia (myalgia was listed for 16 % subjects in ABP 980 arm and for 
1.5% in trastuzumab EU arm /arthralgia occurred in 10.0% and 1.8%, respectively). 
Study 20120283 
A total of 725 patients (ABP 980: 364 patients; trastuzumab: 361 patients) received at least one dose of 
investigational product and were thus included in the safety population. 
The majority of patients received 4 doses of IP treatment (ABP 980: 357 patients (98.1%), trastuzumab: 352 
patients (97.5%)) as well as the Q3W schedule of paclitaxel (ABP 980: 70.3%; trastuzumab: 71.5%). Overall, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 55/71 
 
  
  
parameters such as cumulative dose administered, relative dose intensity and number of subjects with dose 
delay were comparable between the treatment groups for both IP and paclitaxel, respectively. 
Neoadjuvant Phase 
During the neoadjuvant phase most subjects (292 [80.2%] and 287 [79.5%] in the ABP 980 and trastuzumab 
arms, respectively) experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), and 54 (14.8%) and 51 subjects 
(14.1%) experienced CTCAE grade ≥ 3 adverse events. The number of IP-related TEAEs, TEAES leading to IP 
discontinuation and IP-related SAEs was comparable between the treatment groups. The largest difference 
between the treatment groups has been observed in the SOC „Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” 
(ABP980:10.4% [n=38] vs. trastuzumab: 4.7% [n=17]). The most frequently reported TEAEs were arthralgia, 
asthenia, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy and anaemia. 
A slightly higher incidence of serious adverse events (4.9% [n=18] vs. 1.4% [n=5]) and events of interest 
(43.1% [n=157] vs 40.7% [n=147]) was reported in the ABP980 group.  A similar situation can be seen in case 
of infusion reaction (21.7% versus 18.8% for ABP 980 and trastuzumab, respectively) and for neutropenia 
(19.0% versus 15.8% for ABP 980 and trastuzumab, respectively). Cardiac failure EOI were only Grade 1 and 2 
and half of the patients in the ABP 980 group had a history of cardiac disease. 
In the ABP 980 group experienced more serious adverse events and more SAEs Grade 3 and 4 compared to the 
trastuzumab group (4.9% [n=18] vs. 1.4% [N=5]). Among these the infection and infestation was the most 
common SOC with pneumonia as the predominant PT. 
A total of 5 deaths occurred in study 20120283: 2 events of metastases to the brain and 1 event each of 
pneumonia, septic shock and pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Three of these events occurred in the 
neoadjuvant phase: pneumonia (ABP 980), both events of metastases to the brain (both trastuzumab). None of 
these were considered related to the IP. 
The incidence of antidrug antibodies was low for both treatment groups (ABP 980: 0.6% [n=2]; trastuzumab: 
1.4% [n=5]). The majority of patients had a post-baseline result. No neutralizing antibodies were detected 
during the neoadjuvant phase. 
Adjuvant Phase 
In the adjuvant setting the overall number of adverse events was comparable between the ABP 980 only group 
(61.6%) and the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group (63.2%) whereas in the trastuzumab only group a lower number 
of AEs was reported (56.1%). 
Treatment emergent adverse events were most frequently reported from the injury, poisoning, and procedural 
complications SOC. There was ≥ 5% difference between one or more of the treatment groups in the SOCs of 
Infections and Infestations (15.5% for ABP 980/ABP 980, 9,9% for trastuzumab/trastuzumab, and 13.5% for 
trastuzumab/ABP 980), Nervous System Disorders (13.5%, 7.0%, and 8.8%, respectively), and 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (10.9%, 4.1%, and 6.4%, respectively). Events of radiation skin injury and 
neutropenia were the treatment emergent adverse events reported most frequently (10.6%, 9.9% and 9.4% in 
the ABP 980/ABP 980, trastuzumab/trastuzumab, and trastuzumab/ABP 980 groups, respectively, for radiation 
skin injury; and 7.2%, 5.8%, and 3.5%, respectively, for neutropenia).  The proportion of subjects who 
experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent adverse events in the 3 treatment groups was 8.6%, 6.4%, and 
7.6%, respectively. The most common grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent adverse events were hypertension, 
neutropenia and gamma glutamyltransferase increased.

The number of patients experiencing an AE that led to discontinuation of investigational product was comparable 
between the treatment groups whereas the number of patients with AEs leading to study discontinuation was 
slightly higher in the ABP 980 only group compared to the trastuzumab only group and the trastuzumab/ABP 
980 group. 
IP-related AEs occurred slightly more often in the ABP 980 only group 59 patients [n=16.9%] with 137 events 
in the ABP only group compared to the trastuzumab only group (24 patients [n=14.0%] with 54 events) and the 
trastuzumab/ABP 980 group 26 patients [n=15.9%] with 61 events). There appears to be no clear pattern. 
Neutropenia, leukopenia and anemia were the most frequently overserved PTs. 
The incidence of EOI was higher in the ABP 980 only group (32.7%) compared to the trastuzumab only group 
(25.1%) and the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group (29.8%). This finding is confirmed by exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates of EOI per 100 patients-years. Of note in this category (SOC), the incidence rate of infections 
and infestations is higher for the ABP 980/ABP 980 arm (15.5% versus 9.9% in the trastuzumab/trastuzumab 
arm, respectively). In addition the observed trend towards higher incidence of infections and infestations has 
also been reported in study 20130119 (PK in HV).  
The incidence of ≥ Grade 3 EOI was similar between the treatment groups.  
The number of SAEs (5.2%, 3.5%, and 3.5% subjects in the ABP 980 only, trastuzumab only and trastuzumab 
/ABP 980 group, respectively) and grade 3 SAEs in the adjuvant phase is slightly increased in the ABP 980 only 
group compared to the trastuzumab only group and the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group. One grade 5 SAE was 
reported in one subject in the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group (septic shock) which was also classified as EOI. 
A total of 6 deaths occurred in study 20120283 - two of those during the adjuvant phase in the trastuzumab/ABP 
980 group: septic shock pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. 
0.6%, 1.2% and 1.8% of patients were binding antibody positive in the ABP 980 only group, the trastuzumab 
only group and the trastuzumab/ABP 980 group, respectively. 1 patient with negative or no results before the 
adjuvant phase was transient binding antibody positive during the adjuvant phase (trastuzumab/ABP 980 
group). No neutralizing antibodies were detected during the adjuvant phase. In general the immunogenicity of 
trastuzumab is low. The level of post-baseline immunogenicity is still unexpectedly low (ADA incidence for 
originator studies ranges around 7-8%). 
Data on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) are still too immature to draw any conclusions. 
Three SOCs were considered to most significantly impact the overall adverse events: nervous system disorders, 
gastrointestinal disorders and infections and infestations. For all SOCs the reported subject incidences were 
below the historical trastuzumab data reported in the Herceptin SmPC. For infections and infestations no related 
events were reported. For GI disorders 0.9% events for ABP 980 vs 0.6% for trastuzumab were considered 
related to the IP (all of which were nausea). For the SOC Nervous system disorders the Applicant the incidences 
of related AEs were slightly higher in the ABP 980 arm, however the overall incidences are very low: headache 
1.1% vs 0.6%, dizziness 0.3% vs. 0%, peripheral neuropathy 0.6% vs 0% (ABP 980 vs. trastuzumab).  
The observed differences in these SOCs were driven by Grade 1 and 2 AEs. This is however only partly relevant 
to this submission as Kanjinti is developed as a biosimilar medicinal product whose primary focus should be on 
the similarity to the originator preferably with a direct comparison in the pivotal clinical trial. 
It is acknowledged that the overall safety profile and AE incidences observed in the ABP 980 arm are comparable 
to the historical profile and data reported in the SmPC. The observed differences in the safety profile of ABP 980 
could be owed to the known variability of the originator together with chance findings in the pivotal study.

Safety based on ADCC 
Another additional analysis provided safety data from the adjuvant phase separate for trastuzumab with and 
without low ADCC batches by NK92 ADCC assay and PBMC assay, respectively. Although small numerical 
differences were noted according to the data sets analysed, such differences were not considered to be clinically 
significant. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Although small numerical differences were noted between Kanjinti and Herceptin according to the data sets 
analysed, such differences were not considered to be clinically significant. Overall the observed safety profiles of 
ABP 980 and trastuzumab are consistent with the historical safety profile of trastuzumab.

the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kanjinti (trastuzumab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Kanjinti (ABP 980) has been developed by Amgen Europe B.V. as a similar biological medicinal product to 
Herceptin for intravenous (IV) use which was approved in the European Union (EU) in August 2000 
(EMEA/H/C/000278).  
The therapeutic indications, dosage and route of administration proposed for ABP 980 are identical to those 
approved for Herceptin for IV use in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, early breast cancer and metastatic 
gastric cancer. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
A comprehensive analytical similarity assessment was conducted, which included comparative evaluations of 
biological activities, primary structure, higher order structure, particles and aggregates, product-related 
substances and impurities, thermal stability and degradation studies, general properties, and process-related 
impurities. Data were evaluated against pre-defined similarity assessment criteria. A multi-tiered approach was 
used to define similarity. The biological activities were evaluated by a comprehensive set of functional assays 
and binding studies addressing both Fab and Fc-functions of the molecule. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 63/71 
 
  
  
The efficacy and activity of KANJINTI as compared to trastuzumab has been evaluated in three preclinical 
xenograft tumour models overexpressing HER2. KANJINTI and trastuzumab (EU) were effective in inhibiting 
tumour growth in the tested setup, consistent with the known trastuzumab MOA.  
The clinical evidence supporting the similarity of ABP 980 to the reference product, trastuzumab, includes a 3 
arm, single dose PK similarity study in healthy male subjects comparing ABP 980 to trastuzumab (US) and 
trastuzumab (EU) (Study 20130119); and a randomised, double blind, active controlled clinical similarity study 
comparing efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of ABP 980 to trastuzumab (EU) in female subjects with EBC 
(Study 20120283). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Regarding the primary structure the results demonstrate that ABP 980 has a similar intact molecular mass 
compared to trastuzumab (EU), similar levels of the reduced and deglycosylated LC and HC masses, the same 
amino acid sequence, similar disulphide structure and similar levels of free sulfhydryl. No significant differences 
were observed for assays addressing inhibition of HER2 signalling such as Proliferation Inhibition Bioassays in 
BT-474 and NCI-N87 cells, HER2 Binding by ELISA, Inhibition of AKT Phosphorylation. No meaningful differences 
are observed in FcRn and FcγR binding. The ADCC activity of all ABP980 lots was within the quality range 
calculated from ADCC activity of trastuzumab (EU). 
The overall data on PD/PK and toxicology indicate that ABP 980 can be considered similar to the reference 
product Herceptin. The results of the nonclinical program demonstrate similarity between ABP 980 and 
trastuzumab with respect to inhibition of tumour growth in BT-474 and NCI-N87 xenograft models. The TK of 
ABP 980 was assessed in a GLP-compliant, 1-month multiple-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkey. 
Based on t1/2, AUC0-inf, AUC0-96h and AUC0-168h values, trastuzumab exposure was similar after injection of 
Herceptin or FTMB (ratios ranged between 0.94 and 1.15 on day 1 and between 1.08 and 1.15 in week 4). No 
unscheduled mortalities occurred and no signs of systemic toxicity were observed. Local reactions were 
observed in both trastuzumab-treated groups, but with a higher incidence and duration in animals treated with 
FTMB. Body weight was not affected in any group. There were no treatment-related findings in 
electrocardiography, blood pressure, ophthalmology, hematology and urinalysis. At blood biochemistry similar 
slightly higher mean urea and triglyceride levels were observed in groups treated with Herceptin and FTMB 
compared to placebo. There were no significant differences in the organ weights, macroscopic or microscopic 
changes between the Herceptin and the FTMB groups. There were no organ weight changes related to the 
administration of Herceptin or FTMB. There was a trend towards increased lymphoid stimulation in the popliteal 
lymph nodes draining the injection sites in the Herceptin and FTMB groups. There were no significant effects at 
the injection sites after injections of Herceptin or FTMB. Overall the toxicology data indicate that ABP980 and 
Herceptin can be considered comparable. 
Based on the efficacy results of the phase III study Kanjinti was concluded to be equivalent to Herceptin. Results 
for other efficacy endpoints (EFS and OS) are still immature but do not suggest significant differences at the one 
year time point. The observed difference in pCR was considered at least in part confounded by a small shift in 
ADCC activity in a number of the Herceptin batches used in the pivotal trial. Overall it is doubtful that a small 
shift as the one observed would have any significant impact in terms of clinical outcomes although numerically 
it is thought to have contributed to a more extreme location of the point estimate and upper bound of the 
confidence interval, shifting the latter beyond the pre-specified equivalence margin. Based on additional 
analysis and considering the evidence of similarity provided in terms of quality, non-clinical, PK, clinical efficacy 
and safety, biosimilarity has been sufficiently shown for Kanjinti compared to the reference product Herceptin.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The exact magnitude of the effect of the observed ADCC shift for Herceptin on bpCR and clinical important 
endpoints is not known but the effect is likely to be small and not of clinical relevance. In view of the totality of 
the data, this remaining uncertainty does not question the biosimilarity between Kanjinti and Herceptin. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Clinical 
Study 20130119 
The safety findings were comparable between the ABP980 group and the trastuzumab (EU) group. 
Study 20120283 
In the neoadjuvant phase the overall number of adverse events was comparable between the ABP980 and the 
trastuzumab groups (62.1% vs. 60.9%, respectively)  
Safety results from the adjuvant phase reveal small differences in the ABP980 only arm, the rate of 
treatment-emergent adverse events (61.6% [N=215] vs 56.1% [N=96] vs 63.2% [N=108], respectively) and 
serious adverse events (5.2% [N=18] vs 3.5% [N=6] vs 3.5% [N=6]  respectively), IP-related adverse events 
(16.9 [N=59] vs 14.0% [N=24] vs 15.2% [N=26], in the ABP980 only group, the trastuzumab only group and 
the trastuzumab/ABP980 group, respectively). 
However, overall, the safety profile of ABP 980 and trastuzumab is consistent with the historical safety profile of 
trastuzumab and data reported in the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no remaining uncertainties regarding the comparability of the clinical safety of Kanjinti with Herceptin. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
From the quality point of view beside the variability of the originator in the ADCC activity and the correlated 
other quality attributes a-fucose and FcγRIIIa binding, no differences in further quality attributes were identified 
and hence Kanjinti is considered similar to the originator product. The quality data demonstrate that the 
acceptance criteria were met in a narrow range indicating a robust and tightly controlled manufacturing process. 
A robust and well-controlled manufacturing process for drug substance as well as for drug product is in place, 
which is expected to consistently deliver drug substance and drug product of high quality. The provided drug 
substance and drug product batch analyses data support this conclusion. The proposed control strategy is 
considered appropriate and ensures that material with consistent quality will be released to the market.  
From a clinical perspective, the observed results demonstrate strong evidence of similarity on PK level, which is 
generally considered a sensitive clinical model to evaluate biosimilarity. Results close to unity were observed for 
exposure in a single dose healthy volunteer PK study and confirmed in EBC patients in the applicant’s efficacy 
trial. 
It is considered that the variability in ADCC activity may contribute to the observed differences in terms of 
clinical efficacy. Additional factors that might have contributed to the observed efficacy results cannot be

EMA/CHMP/261937/2018 
Page 65/71 
 
  
  
completely ruled out. Taking into account the sensitivity of the primary endpoint and the small difference in the 
efficacy results between ABP 980 and Herceptin, this deviation is not considered clinically relevant and is unlikely 
to have any impact on clinically relevant time-dependent endpoints. 
Overall the observed safety profiles of ABP 980 and trastuzumab are consistent with the historical safety profile 
of trastuzumab. 
Considering the totality of evidence where similarity is supported by quality, non-clinical, PK as well as safety 
and immunogenicity data, similarity in terms of efficacy can be concluded. 
Regarding extrapolation of all indications approved for the reference product Herceptin, scientific evidence is 
indicating that the mechanism of action of trastuzumab is similar in different target conditions like both early 
and metastatic breast cancer (HER2-positive) as well as HER2-positive gastric cancer. Hence, extrapolation to 
the non-studied oncology indications is considered acceptable. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
Kanjinti is considered biosimilar to Herceptin and therefore the overall B/R is positive. 
Divergent position(s) is appended to this report.

Early breast cancer 
KANJINTI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see 
section 5.1). 
following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with paclitaxel 
or docetaxel. 
in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. 
in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant KANJINTI therapy, for locally 
advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
KANJINTI should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have either 
HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
KANJINTI in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction who have 
not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. 
KANJINTI should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have HER2 
overexpression as defined by IHC 2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ result. Accurate 
and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
In respect of clinical efficacy, study 20120283 failed to demonstrate equivalence in pCR rates according to the 
pre-specified  equivalence  margins.  Explorations  of  the  relationship  between  ADCC  activity  of  clinical  trial 
batches, which have been hypothesised to impact efficacy, and pCR rates are inconclusive. Post hoc analyses 
that,  variously,  exclude  patients  and  alter  the  covariates  included  in  the  primary  analysis  model  risk 
introduction of important bias and are not accepted. Consequently, biosimilarity has not been demonstrated 
between ABP980 and the reference product Herceptin.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Glaxo  Group  Ltd.  submitted  on  8  January  2013  an  application  for  Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Anoro, through the centralised procedure 
under  Article  3(2)(a)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised  procedure 
was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 24 May 2012.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Anoro is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol were considered to be a new active substance. 
The  application  submitted  is  composed  of  administrative  information,  complete  quality  data,  non-
clinical  and  clinical  data  based  on  applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and/or  bibliographic  literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision 
CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver for the condition “COPD”. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant  to  Article 8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  141/2000  and  Article  3 of  Commission  Regulation  (EC) 
No  847/2000,  the  applicant  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indications. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substances vilanterol (as trifenatate) and umeclidinium bromide 
contained in the above medicinal product to be considered each as a new active substance in itself, 
as  the  applicant  claims  that  it  is  not  a  constituent  of  a  product  previously  authorised  within  the 
Union. 
Scientific Advice 
The  applicant  received  Scientific  Advice  from  the  CHMP  on  20  May  2010  and  23  September  2010 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/568901/2010,  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/568902/2010,  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/568903/2010 
and  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/287082/2010).  The  Scientific  Advice  pertained  to  quality,  non-clinical  and

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
COPD  is  a  preventable  respiratory  disorder  characterised  by  airflow  limitation,  which  is  not  fully 
reversible.  The  airflow  limitation  is  usually  progressive  and  is  associated  with  an  abnormal 
inflammatory  response  in  the  lungs  to  noxious  particles  or  gases,  primarily  caused  by  cigarette 
smoking. COPD is characterized by symptoms of chronic and progressive breathlessness (or dyspnea), 
cough, and sputum production which can be a major cause of disability and anxiety associated with the 
disease. 
In  reality  the  disease  is  not  limited  to  the  airway  and  treating  physicians  are  faced  with  a  multi-
component  disease  that  is  characterised  by  a  range  of  pathological  changes,  which  include  mucous 
hypersecretion,  airway  narrowing,  loss  of  alveoli  in  the  lungs,  and  loss  of  lean  body  mass  and 
cardiovascular  effects  at  a  systemic  level.  COPD  patients  are  also  heterogeneous  in  terms  of  their 
clinical  presentation,  disease  severity  and  rate  of  disease  progression.  Their  degree  of  airflow 
limitation,  as  measured  by  FEV1,  is  also  known  to  be  poorly  correlated  to  the  severity  of  their 
symptoms. 
COPD  is  a  major  cause  of  chronic  morbidity  and  mortality  throughout  the  world.  It  is  estimated  that 
approximately eight percent of the population have COPD and approximately ten percent of those over 
40  years  of  age.  However  the  true  prevalence  of  the  disease  is  likely  to  be  higher  than  this  due  to 
under-diagnosis  and  delayed  diagnosis  until  the  disease  becomes  clinically  apparent  and  is  then 
moderately advanced. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in Europe and is expected to rise to 
third by 2020. 
The  goals  of  COPD  assessment  are  to  determine  the  severity  of  the  disease,  its  impact  on  patient’s 
health  status  and  the  risk  of  future  events  (such  as  exacerbations,  hospital  admissions  or  death),  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 10/308 
 
 
  
  
order to, eventually guide therapy. The most used classification based on severity of airflow limitation 
in  COPD  (based  on  post-bronchodilatory  FEV1)  is  the  Global  Initiative  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Lung 
Disease (GOLD) classification. Patients with FEV1/FVC <0.70 are classified in to mild, moderate, severe 
and very severe based on spirometry as below: 
GOLD 1  Mild 
FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted 
GOLD 2  Moderate 
50% ≤ FEV1 < 80% predicted 
GOLD 3  Severe 
30% ≤ FEV1 < 50% predicted 
GOLD 4  Very Severe  FEV1 < 30% predicted 
Recently, GOLD has recommended an approach of combined COPD assessment based on the impact of 
COPD on an individual patient which combines symptomatic assessment with the patient’s spirometric 
classification and/or risk of exacerbations. This approach is illustrated below.  
The  most  important  aspect  of  management  of  the  condition  is  educational  and  social:  the  avoidance 
and  cessation  of  tobacco  smoking.  However,  once  COPD  is  established  the  recommendations  for  the 
pharmacological  treatment  of  COPD  are  based  on  the  severity  of  the  condition.  The  current  GOLD 
recommendations on the pharmacological therapy for stable COPD are depicted below:

The GOLD recommendation is that the combined use of long-acting beta agonists and anticholinergics 
may  be  considered  if  symptoms  are  not  improved  with  single  agents  (Evidence    -  B  which  is 
randomized controlled trials – limited body of data). 
About the product 
Anoro is a novel fixed dose combination of two new active substances: umeclidinium bromide, a novel 
long  acting  muscarinic  antagonist  (LAMA)  and  vilanterol  trifenatate,  a  novel  long-acting  β 2  agonist 
(LABA). Approved bronchodilators, such as LABAs and LAMAs, have been available for the treatment of 
COPD patients since 2004 and they can be used alone or together. 
Anoro 62.5 µg/25 µg & 125 µg/25 µg inhalation powder is a pre-dispensed multi dose dry powder for 
oral  inhalation.  The  active  ingredients  are  umeclidinium  bromide  (UMEC)  and  Vilanterol  (VI)  (as 
trifenatate).  UMEC  is  a  long  acting  muscarinic  receptor  antagonist  (also  referred  to  as  an 
anticholinergic), while VI is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).  
Assessment report

Page 12/308 
 
 
 
  
  
The  novel  dry  powder  inhaler  (NDPI),  called  Ellipta,  incorporates  two  blister  strips,  one  containing  a 
blend of micronised UMEC, lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate; and the other containing a 
blend  of  micronised  VI,  lactose  monohydrate  and  magnesium  stearate.  Upon  actuation,  the  inhaler 
delivers the contents of one blister containing UMEC blend and one blister containing VI blend.  
Anoro is a novel LAMA/LABA fixed dose combination for oral inhalation administered from a Novel Dry 
Powder Inhaler (NDPI). It contains umeclidinium bromide (UMEC; GSK573719), a LAMA, and vilanterol 
(VI;  vilanterol trifenatate; GW642444M), an inhaled LABA. Neither UMEC nor  VI is currently available 
as  an  individual  component  for  oral  inhalation.  However,  VI  is  one  of  the  active  substances  in  Relvar 
Ellipta,  a  fixed  dose  combination  of  an  ICS  and  a  LABA,  recently  authorised  via  the  Centralised 
Procedure. 
It should be noted that the data submitted in the application dossier referred to Anoro 62.5 μg/25 µg 
and  125  µg/25  µg  as  the finished  medicinal  product,  which  corresponds  to  the  metered  dose  of  both 
active  substances.  This  was  the  basis  used  during  the  assessment  of  this  application.  However  in 
accordance  with  the  “Guideline  on  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  QRD 
Recommendations on the expression of strength in the name of Centrally Authorised Human Medicinal 
Products”  (as  stated  in  Section  1  of  the  SmPC  and  in  the  name  section  of  the  Labelling  and  Package 
Leaflet),  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  strength  should  refer  to  the  delivered  dose  of  both  active 
substances  and  therefore  the  name  of  the  medicinal  product  finally  approved  by  the  Committee  was 
expressed as follows: Anoro 55 μg/22 µg, in all official approved documents (CHMP opinion/future EC 
decision and CHMP assessment report). Since 62.5 μg/25 µg and 125 µg/25 µg (metered dose) were 
the strengths referred to throughout the non-clinical and clinical development of this medicinal product 
and  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  this  has  been  left  unchanged  in  the  sections  of  this 
assessment report relating to the non-clinical and clinical development.  
The Applicant initially applied for the following indication:  
•  Maintenance  bronchodilator  treatment  to  relieve  symptoms  in  adult  patients  with  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
The  posology  requested  was  one  inhalation  of  Anoro  55/22  micrograms  once  daily.  The  proposed 
maximum  dose  was  one  inhalation  of  Anoro  113/22  micrograms  once  daily.  Use  of  Anoro  113/22 
micrograms  once  daily  in  patients  who  are  responsive  to  salbutamol  has  been  shown  to  provide 
additional clinical benefit with regard to lung function and rescue medication use.

The  finished  product  contains  umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol  trifenatate  as  the  active  substances, 
the  active  moieties  being  umeclidinium  and  vilanterol,  respectively.    It  is  a  pre-dispensed  inhalation 
powder which is presented in a plastic inhaler. The inhaler contains two multi-dose blister strips, having 
either 7 or 30 doses. One strip has blisters containing 62.5 micrograms of umeclidinium (as bromide) and 
the other strip has blisters containing 25 micrograms of vilanterol (as trifenatate). 
When  actuated,  the  inhaler  delivers  the  contents  of  a  single  blister  simultaneously  from  each  of  the 
two  blister  strips.  Each  actuation  provides  a  delivered  dose  of  55  micrograms  of  umeclidinium  (as 
bromide) and 22 micrograms of vilanterol (as trifenatate). The inhaler is packaged in a sealed tray with 
a desiccant. 
Other ingredients in both inhalation powders are lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Anoro  contains  two  active  substances:  umeclidinium  bromide  a  novel  long  acting  muscarinic 
antagonist, and vilanterol trifenatate, a novel long-acting β2 agonist. 
Umeclidinium bromide 
The chemical name of umeclidinium bromide (INN) is 1-[2-(Benzyloxy)ethyl]-4-(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-
1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bromide and has the following structure:  
Umeclidinium  bromide  (INN)  is  a  white  crystalline,  non-hygroscopic  powder  that  is  slightly  soluble  in 
water,  propan-1-ol,  butan-1-ol,  toluene,  ethanol  and  acetonitrile,  sparingly  soluble  in  methanol  and 
freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide. 
The  molecular  structure  has  been  fully  characterised  by  elemental  analysis,  proton  and  carbon  NMR, 
MS,  IR,  X-ray  powder  diffraction  (XRPD)  and  differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC).  Umeclidinium 
bromide  has  a  non-chiral  molecular  structure.  Polymorphism  has  been  observed  but  the  synthesis 
process consistenly yields one polymorphic form. 
Manufacture 
Non-micronised  active  substance  is  supplied  by  one  manufacturer.  It  is  synthesised  by  a  3-stage 
process which is followed by a micronisation step perfomed at another site. The starting materials and 
reagents are well defined and with acceptable specifications.  
Umeclidinium  bromide  was  developed  using  a  ‘quality  by  design’  (QbD)  approach  which  involved  the 
identification of potential critical process parameters (CPPs) that might have an impact on the critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance. Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were set for those 
process  parameters  that  were  found  to  be  critical.  The  available  development  data,  the  proposed 
control  strategy  and  batch  analysis  data  from  commercial  scale  batches  fully  support  the  proposed 
PARs. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014

The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for description  (visual),  identity  and  solid  state  form 
(IR),  umeclidinium  bromide  contentby  HPLC,  related  impurities  (HPLC),  residual  solvent  (GC),  water 
content (Karl Fischer titration), residue on ignition and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). The 
absence of a microbial limit test and heavy metals has been satisfactorily justified. 
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  results  for  assay,  related  impurities,  residual  solvents,  water 
content  and  residue  on  ignition  tests  are  not  affected  by  micronisation.  Therefore,  it  was  found 
acceptable to perform these tests on the non-micronised active substance. Impurities present at higher 
level than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical 
studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Batch  analyses  data  on  eight  production  scale  batches  of  micronised  active  substance  and  three 
batches  of  the  non-micronised  active  substance  have  been  provided.  The  results  are  within  the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  three  commercial  batches  of  micronised  active  substance  from  the  proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 18 months under intermediate conditions 
at  30  ºC  /  65%  RH  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  were 
submitted.  Additionally,  stability  data  for  one  batch  of  the  non-micronised  active  substance  under 
intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 
ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  content,  drug-related  impurities,  water  content, 
particle  size  distribution  (for  micronised  umeclidinium  bromide)  and  solid  state  form  by  XRPD  (for 
micronised umeclidinium bromide). The analytical tests used are stability indicating. 
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  also  performed.  Stress  testing  was 
performed  on  one  batch  of  micronised  and  on  one  batch  of  non-micronised  umeclidinium  bromide 
under  50°C/ambient  humidity  for  3  months,  freeze/thaw  conditions  of  -20°C  and  30°C  under  7  day 
cycles and  under 40°C/75% RH  for 3 months  with storage in a low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag, 
maintained in an upright orientation.  
Forced degradation studies were also conducted in the solid state (14 days at 80ºC under ambient and 
75%  relative  humidity),  and  under  exposure  to  UV/visible  light;  and  in  solution  at  80 ºC  and  under 
acidic, basic and oxidative conditions, in order to identify potential degradation pathways. 
All  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container and 
proposed storage conditions. 
Vilanterol trifenatate 
Vilanterol  trifenatate  is  the  second  active  substance  in  Anoro.  It  is  a  white,  non-hygroscopic  powder 
that  is  practically  insoluble  in  water;  practically  insoluble  in  heptane;  very  slightly  soluble  in  toluene 
and t-methyl butyl ether; slightly soluble in acetonitrile, ethanol and 2-propanol; soluble in methanol; 
freely soluble in dichloromethane and dimethyl sulfoxide.

The  chemical  name  of  vilanterol  trifenatate  is:  triphenylacetic  acid  -  4-{(1R)-2-[(6-{2-[(2,6-
dichlorobenzyl)oxy]ethoxy}hexyl)amino]-1-hydroxyethyl}-2-(hydroxymethyl)phenol  and  it  has  the 
following structural formula: 
Vilanterol trifenatate is the triphenylacetate salt of vilanterol (INN), a secondary amine. It contains one 
asymmetric  carbon;  the  active  substance  is  the  R-isomer.  The  molecular  structure  of  vilanterol  has 
been elucidated by proton and carbon NMR, MS, IR, elemental analysis and X-ray crystallography. 
Vilanterol (INN) exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral center. Enantiomeric purity 
is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. Polymorphism has not been observed for vilanterol trifenatate. 
Manufacture 
Non-micronised  vilanterol  trifenatate  is  supplied  by  one  active  substance  manufacturer.  It  is 
synthesised by a 4-step process followed by micronisation. Micronisation is performed at another site. 
Vilanterol  trifenatate  was  developed  using  a  ‘quality  by  design’  (QbD)  approach  which  involved  the 
identification of potential critical process parameters (CPPs) that might have an impact on the critical 
quality  attributes  (CQAs)  of  the  active  substance.  Proven  acceptable  ranges  (PAR)  were  set  for  the 
CPPS. A detailed description of the manufacturing process has been provided and the scaling-up of the 
PARs has been justified. Well defined starting materials and reagents have been used and adequate in-
process controls are applied during the synthesis.  
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  description  (visual),  identity  (IR),  vilanterol 
trifenatate  content  by  HPLC,  related  impurities  (HPLC),  enantiomer  content  (chiral  HPLC),  residual 
solvent  (GC),  water  content  (Karl  Fischer  titration),  residue  on  ignition  and  particle  size  distribution 
(laser  diffraction).  The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial 
methods have been appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch  analysis  data  have  been  provided  for  eleven  production  scale  batches  of  non-micronised 
vilanterol  trifenatate  manufactured  using  the  commercial  process.  From  these  batches,  up  to  51 
batches of micronised vilanterol trifenatate have been produced and analysed. All batches tested were 
found to comply with the pre-defined specifications. The results demonstrate that the active ingredient 
can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Stability 
Stability  data  obtained  under  ICH  long-term  conditions  (25ºC/60%  RH),  and  accelerated  conditions 
(40ºC/75%  RH)  have  been  provided  for  6  batches  of  micronized  vilanterol  and  two  batches  of  non-
micronised  vilanterol.  Up  to  36  months  long  term  data  and  up  to  6  months  accelerated  stability  data 
were presented. The stability batches have been manufactured by the proposed commercial process at 
the  commercial  scale  and  were  packed  in  the  containers  representative  of  those  intended  for 
marketing.

The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  vilanterol  trifenatate  content,  impurities, 
enantiomer  content,  water  content,  particle  size  distribution  of  the  micronised  and  non-micronised 
active substance by laser diffraction, specific surface area of the non-micronised active substance and 
of  the  micronised  vilanterol  trifenatate  (nitrogen  gas  adsorption),  solid  state  form  (XRPD)  and  the 
melting  point/amorphous  content  (differential  scanning  calorimetry).  The  analytical  tests  used  are 
stability indicating. 
Photostability  and  stress  testing  was  performed on  2  batches  each  of  micronised  and  non-micronised 
vilanterol  trifenatate.  The  stress  testing  conditions  include:  50°C/ambient  humidity;  freeze/thaw 
conditions, storage under reduced packaging and exposure to light. 
Furthermore,  forced  degradation  studies  were  conducted  in  the  solid  state  (14  days  at  80 ºC  under 
ambient and 75% relative humidities) and under exposure to UV/visible light; and in solution at 60 ºC 
and under acidic, basic and oxidative conditions. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container and 
proposed storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The goal was to develop a dry powder inhaler that would deliver umeclidinium bromide in combination 
with vilanterol trifenatate. It was decided to formulate the active substances in two separate powders 
for inhalation within a single inhaler. This approach allowed for independent formulation development 
and optimisation of the inhalation powders and required the development of a novel dry powder inhaler 
capable  of  delivering  pre-metered  doses  from  two  blister  strips  simultaneously.  The  inhaler  has  been 
designed to provide up to thirty days therapy and it incorporates a counter which shows the number of 
doses remaining.  
A quality by design (QbD) approach was adopted for product development. The following critical quality 
attributes  (CQAs)  were  identified  for  the  finished  product:  identity,  drug-related  impurities, 
emitted/delivered  dose,  particle  size  distribution  of  the  emitted/delivered  dose  (PSD),  foreign 
particulate matter, microbiological quality and leachables. Three of the finished product CQAs (identity, 
PSD  and  drug-related  impurities)  were  found  to  be  strongly  related  to  the  quality  attributes  of  the 
micronized umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol trifenatate. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used 
to  model  the  fine  particle  mass  per  inhalation  from  the  particle  size  distribution  of  both  active 
substances.  
The  applicant  performed  a  risk  assessment  (Failure  Modes  and  Effects  Analysis)  to  identify  the 
manufacturing process parameters that needed to be further studied in development and defined their 
criticality. Univariate and multivariate (DOE) studies have been performed to identify and confirm CPP 
and PARs have been defined for the critical process parameters.  
The excipients used in Anoro are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant 
with  Ph.  Eur  standards  and  additional  in-house  standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the 
finished  product  formulation.  The  excipients  in  the  umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol  blisters  are 
magnesium stearate (stabiliser) and lactose monohydrate (diluent/carrier).  
A  novel  inhalation  device  containing  two  separate  blister  strips  has  been  developed  to  allow  optimal 
inhalation  of  the  active  substances.  Appropriate  studies  have  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  the

The inhaler has a light grey body and a red mouthpiece. It is packed in a foil tray which also contains a 
desiccant. Adequate information on the design and composition of the inhaler has been included in the 
product information. 
Adventitious agents 
Lactose monohydrate is of animal origin and magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
Manufacture of the product 
Anoro  is  manufactured  by  a  manufacturing  process  that  involves  the  following  operations: 
umeclidinium  blending,  filling  of  the  umeclidinium  strip,  vilanterol  blending,  filling  of  the  vilanterol 
strip, assembly of the inhaler and packing.   
A ‘quality by design’ (QbD) approach was adopted for product development. For each finished product 
CQA, the  CQAs of  starting materials and intermediates, and the critical process parameters (CPPs) of 
the  unit  operations  have  been  identified;  proven  acceptable  ranges  have  been  set  for  the  critical 
process parameters.  
The  process  has  been  validated  for  ten  commercial  batches  of  inhalers  containing  umeclidinium 
/vilanterol  62.5/25  µg.  The  data  collected  as  part  of  process  qualification  indicate  that  the 
manufacturing  process  is  robust  and  will  consistently  yield  a  product  of  intended  quality.  The 
manufacturing process is adequately described and critical steps are under control.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  appearance,  identification 
umeclidinium and vilanterol (UV, HPLC-UV, HPLC-fluorescence), mean umeclidinium content and mean 
vilanterol  content  per  blister  (both  100  ±  5%  of  nominal  blister  content  by  HPLC),  umeclidinium 
uniformity of delivered dose (HPLC), vilanterol uniformity of delivered dose (HPLC), fine particle mass 
of  umeclidinium  and  vilanterol  (by  next  generation  impaction)  and  microbiological  quality  of 
umeclidinium and of vilanterol. The analytical methods have been adequately validated.    
Batch analysis data have been presented for eight production-scale batches of umeclidinium /vilanterol 
62.5/25 µg inhalation powders. Results have been presented for five batches in the 30-dose and three 
batches  in  the  7-dose  presentations.  The  batches  were  all  produced  at  the  intended  site  of 
manufacture.

All batches for which results have been provided complied fully with the release specification presented 
above.  The  data  confirm  consistency  and  uniformity  of  manufacture  and  indicate  that  the  process  is 
capable of consistently producing a finished product that meets the predefined specifications and that 
the manufacturing process is under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data have been generated under long-term (25ºC/60%RH), intermediate (30ºC/75%RH), and 
accelerated  (40ºC/75%RH)  conditions  in  line  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Up  to  18  months  primary 
stability  data  for  umeclidinium  /vilanterol  inhalation  powder  are  presented  for  three  batches.  These 
batches  were  produced  at  production-scale  and  assembled  at  the  proposed  commercial  site  and 
equipment. The primary pack (blister strip) is identical to the one intended for commercialisation, and 
the  tray  and  inhaler  used  in  the  stability  studies  are  representative  of the  commercial one.  The  tests 
performed are the same as those performed at release and are considered to be stability indicating.  
Three  months  in-use  stability  data  for  both  initial  and  aged  product  are  presented.  Testing  has  been 
performed from the initial timepoint and after storage for 6 and 9 months at 25°C/60% RH. Following 
removal  of  the  secondary  packaging  and  desiccant  packet,  the  inhaler  was  replaced  on  storage  at 
25°C/75%  RH.  The  results  of  the  stability  studies  demonstrate  the  chemical  and  physical  stability  of 
the  finished  product  when  stored  for  the  proposed  in-use  storage  period  at  25°C/75%  RH.  No 
significant changes were observed in description or drug-related impurity content of umeclidinium and 
vilanterol. All results comply with the proposed commercial specification up to the proposed patient in-
use period. 
In  addition,  photostability  and  stress  testing  was  performed:  freeze/thaw  studies,  high  temperature 
and UV-visible light exposure. 
The  shelf-life  specifications  include  the  same  tests  as  for  release  with  the  exception  of  the  following 
three  additional  tests:  umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol  drug-related  impurities  (HPLC)  and  mean 
moisture content. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  the  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substances  and  finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner and adequate information has been provided on 
the design and testing of the inhalation device. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  active  substance  and  finished 
product  and  their  manufacturing  process.  However,  no  design  spaces  were  claimed  for  the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive non-clinical development was conducted to support the chronic use of umeclidinium 
bromide and of vilanterol in humans. The non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology 
studies  reported  in  this  dossier  were  conducted  respecting  the  established  guidelines.  Non-clinical 
studies conducted with the combination of umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol were limited to safety 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, repeat-dose toxicity and reproduction toxicity studies in line with the 
Guideline  on 
the  non-clinical  development  of 
fixed  combinations  of  medicinal  products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Pivotal  studies  regarding  umeclidinium  bromide,  vilanterol  and  the  combination  of  umeclidinium 
bromide and vilanterol were performed in compliance with GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
In vitro studies  
Binding studies: 
Binding  studies  were  performed  to  investigate  the  binding  kinetics  of  GSK573719  in  membranes 
prepared  from  transfected  Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells  expressing  individual  muscarinic 
receptor subtypes (mAChR-1 to mAChR-5) (Report CH2006/00020).  
GSK573719  was  shown  to  be  a  potent,  pan-active,  human  muscarinic  antagonist.  The  compound 
competed  with  3H-N-methyl-scopolamine  binding  for  human  recombinant  receptor  membranes  from 
CHO  cells  stably  expressing  the  mAChR-1,  mAChR-2,  mAChR-3,  mAChR-4  and  mAChR-5  receptors 
(n=3) with affinity values in the sub-nM range for the 5 human mAChRs  
Kinetic  binding  studies  were  conducted  with  GSK573719  to  determine  if  it  was  a  competitive 
antagonist  at  the  mAChR-3  receptor.  Saturation  binding  of  3H-N-methyl  scopolamine  in  the  absence 
(vehicle) and presence of increasing concentrations of GSK573719 showed a shift to the right with no 
change  in  maximal  binding.  The  data  were  analyzed  with  a  Scatchard  plot.  The  Kd  increased  with 
increasing  concentrations  of  compound  while  the  maximum  number  of  binding  sites  (Bmax)  was 
unchanged  (average  of  5.75  pmol/mL).  This  data  suggests  that  GSK573719  is  a  surmountable 
competitive antagonist. 
A  study  was  conducted  with  3H-GSK573719  and  3H-tiotropium  (a  commercially  available  muscarinic 
antagonist) in CHO cell membranes recombinantly expressing either the mAChR subtype mAChR-2 or

mAChR-3  using  a  radioligand  filtration  binding  assay  (Report  2012N138876).  Saturation,  association 
and  dissociation  binding  studies  were performed  for  3H-GSK573719  (~0.01  to  2.4  nM,  ~0.02  to 0.43 
nM or ~0.1 nM respectively) and 3H-tiotropium (~0.01 to 2.9 nM, ~0.02 to 0.38 nM or ~0.02 to 0.38 
nM  respectively)  to  determine  receptor  binding  kinetics  at  mAChR-2  and  mAChR-3  receptors.  3H-
GSK573719  exhibited  a  high  affinity  for  both  subtypes.  3H-GSK573719  demonstrated  a  comparable 
affinity for the mAChR-3 receptor but a greater selectivity (~5-fold) for mAChR-3 over mAChR-2 when 
compared  with  3H-tiotropium  (~3-fold).  The  receptor  binding  kinetic  studies  showed  that  both  3H-
GSK573719  and  3H-tiotropium  associated  faster  with  the  mAChR-2  receptor  compared  with  the 
mAChR-3  receptor.  The  kon  values  determined  at  each  individual  receptor  subtype  were  comparable 
between  radioligands.  The  dissociation  studies  showed  that  3H-GSK573719  had  a  faster  t ½  value  for 
the  mAChR-2  receptor  than  that  observed  for  the  mAChR-3  receptor.  When  comparing  t ½  values  for 
3H-GSK573719  at  each  receptor  subtype  with  3H-tiotropium,  3H-GSK573719  displayed  a  faster  t ½ 
value for both the mAChR-2 and mAChR-3 receptor. 
Receptor potency 
A  microtiter  plate  based  calcium  mobilization  FLIPR  (Fluorometric  Imaging  Plate  Reader)  assay  was 
used  for  the  functional  characterization  of  antagonist  inhibition  of  mAChR-1,  mAChR-2  (w/Gqi5)  and 
mAChR-3  stably  expressed  in  CHO  cells  (Report  CH2006/00020).  The  FLIPR  assay  monitors  the 
compound  inhibition  of  ACh-induced  intracellular  calcium  fluxes  mediated  through  cloned  receptors. 
The EC50 values (mean ± standard error) for ACh were 0.80 ± 0.09, 5.30 ± 0.30 and 0.30 ± 0.07 nM, 
respectively. In similar assays GSK573719 was assayed for agonist activity in the cells and there was 
no significant calcium mobilization response, indicating a lack of muscarinic agonist activity. 
Kinetic  studies  were  conducted  for  GSK573719  at  mAChR-1,  mAChR-2  and  mAChR-3  using  human 
recombinant  mAChR-1,  mAChR-2  and  mAChR-3  expressed  in  CHO  cells.  mAChR-1  and  mAChR-3 
receptors  were  expressed  directly  in  CHO  cells,  while  mAChR-2  receptors  were  coupled  to  calcium 
mobilization  via  co-expression  with  the  chimeric  G  protein,  Gqi5,  in  CHO  cells.  GSK573719 
demonstrated pan-active potent functional inhibition of mAChR-1, mAChR-2 and mAChR-3. 
GSK573719  was  characterized  as  a  competitive  inhibitor  at  mAChR-1,  mAChR-2  and  mAChR-3  with 
slopes  of  0.829,  0.928  and  0.963  against  mAChR-1,  mAChR-2  and  mAChR-3,  respectively,  slopes 
which are consistent with competitive kinetics. 
The  reversibility  of  GSK573719  (0,  3.3,  33  and  330  nM)  and  tiotropium  (a  commercially  available 
muscarinic antagonist) (0, 3.3, 10 or 33 nM) was evaluated by washout from mAChR-3 using the FLIPR 
assay. The data indicate that both antagonists washed off to some extent but both appeared to cause 
decreased  receptor  affinity  for  ACh  after  the  pre-treatment  followed  by  washout.  Pre-treatment  and 
washout  by  tiotropium  resulted  in  a  ~10-  to  15-fold  decrease  in  receptor  affinity,  while  GSK573719 
showed a 5- to 20-fold decrease in receptor affinity. 
In vitro efficacy 
Carbachol  (a  cholinomimetic)-mediated  contractions  and  their  blockade  by  GSK573719  were 
investigated  in  isolated  human  bronchus.  Atropine  and  ipratropium,  both  competitive  mAChR 
antagonists,  and  tiotropium,  a  non-competitive  mAChR  inhibitor,  were  included  in  the  study  for 
reference  (Report  CH2006/00014).  GSK573719  (1,  10  or  100  nM)  caused  a  concentration-dependent 
rightward  shift  of  carbachol  concentration-response  curves  in  human  bronchus  yielding  a  pA2  of  9.5 
(Schild slope = 1.4). Some suppression, 10 to 25% of the maximal carbachol response, was observed 
at  all  3  concentrations  of  GSK573719.  Atropine  (10  nM)  induced  a  parallel  shift  of  the  carbachol 
response,  yielding  a  pKB  of  9.6.  In  the  same  studies,  atropine  reached  the  same  maximal  response 
obtained with the vehicle.

In  some  studies,  the  effects  of  GSK573719,  ipratropium  or  tiotropium  on  carbachol  concentration-
response  curves  were  evaluated  in  paired  tissues.  GSK573719  (1,  10  or  100  nM)  caused  a 
concentration-dependent rightward shift of carbachol response curves with suppression of the maximal 
carbachol response (pA2 = 9.5, slope = 1.5). Ipratropium (1, 10 or 100 nM) was a potent inhibitor of 
carbachol-induced contraction with a pA2 of 9.2 (Schild slope = 1.4). Ipratropium and atropine did not 
suppress  the  maximal  carbachol  response.  Tiotropium  had  no  effect  at  0.1  nM,  yet  suppressed  the 
maximal carbachol response by 68% and 66% at 1 and 10 nM, respectively. 
GSK573719  at  1,  10  or  100  nM  was  a  potent  inhibitor  of  carbachol-induced  contraction  of  isolated 
human  bronchus.  GSK573719  also  demonstrated  inhibition  of  maximal  carbachol  responses  between 
10 and 25%. 
In vitro onset and duration of action 
A study was performed in which superfusion was used to determine the onset and duration of inhibition 
of  carbachol-induced  contraction  by  GSK573719  using  isolated  strips  of  human  bronchus  and  guinea 
pig trachea. The onset and duration of inhibition by reference compounds ipratropium and tiotropium 
were also determined in paired tissues (Report CH2006/00015). 
In  initial  studies  in  human  bronchus,  where  tissues  were  washed  once,  maximum  inhibition  of 
carbachol-induced  contraction  was  established.  The  onset  half-times  for  GSK573719  at  1,  10  or  100 
nM  were  63  minutes,  27  minutes  and  14  minutes,  and  the  corresponding  offset  half-times  were  119 
minutes,  145  minutes  and  299  minutes,  respectively.  In  further  studies  where  antagonists  were 
infused  for  6  hours,  the  recovery  half-time  for  GSK573719  at  1,  10  and  100  nM  ranged  from  122 
minutes to greater than 10 hours. Similar studies conducted in guinea pig trachea indicated a similar 
concentration-dependent reversibility profile. 
GSK573719  was  shown  in  this  study  to  have  a  rapid,  concentration-dependent  onset  of  response  in 
both  human  bronchus  and  guinea  pig  trachea.  In  human  bronchus,  reversal  of  GSK573719-induced 
inhibition of carbachol contraction was slow and concentration-dependent, particularly when the tissues 
had  been  pre-incubated  with  the  antagonist  for  6  hours.  Reference  compounds  ipratropium  and 
tiotropium  had  rapid,  concentration-dependent  onset  of  response.  Ipratropium  had  a  short  reversal 
time  whereas  tiotropium  showed  slow  recovery.  Similar  studies  conducted  in  guinea  pig  airway 
indicated  a  similar  reversibility  profile  for  each  antagonist.  Following  a  10  hour  washout  of  the 
antagonists,  both  GSK573719  and  tiotropium  exhibited  residual  inhibition  of  maximal  carbachol-
induced contraction. Ipratropium had no remaining effect. 
Characterisation of GSK573719 metabolites 
The inhibitory potency and direct agonist potential of GSK1761002A and GSK339067A, metabolites of 
GSK573719,  against  the  cloned  human  mAChR-1,  mAChR-2+Gqi5  or  mAChR-3  receptors  were 
investigated  using  the  FLIPR  assay  (Report  CH2009/00016).  Studies  determined  the  antagonist 
potency of GSK1761002A (M33) and GSK339067A (M14), as well as any compound-induced activation 
of  these  muscarinic  receptors,  by  monitoring  the  compound  inhibition  of  ACh-induced  intracellular 
calcium  fluxes  mediated  through  cloned  human  mAChR-1,  mAChR-2+Gqi5  and  mAChR-3  (antagonist 
potency determination), or by monitoring any direct compound-induced receptor-mediated calcium flux 
(compound  agonist  characterization).  No  data  was  obtained  for  metabolite  GSK1761002A  (M33) 
against  mAChR-2+Gqi5.  GSK1761002A  (M33)  showed  functional  potencies  (pIC50s)  >8.0  against 
mAChR-1  and  against  mAChR-3.  Further  characterization  of  potency  against  mAChR-3,  using  single 
compound concentration kinetics, showed a pA2 of 9.87 ± 0.08 (mean ± SEM). 
GSK339067A  (M14)  showed  potencies  (pIC50s)  of  5.92  ±  0.14,  5.78  (n=2)  and  6.25  ±  0.04  against 
mAChR-1,  mAChR-2+Gqi5  and  mAChR-3,  respectively.  GSK1761002A  (M33)  showed  no  direct 
Assessment report

activation of either mAChR-1 or mAChR-3. GSK339067A (M14) showed no direct activation of mAChR-
1, mAChR-2+Gqi5 or mAChR-3. 
The  data  show  GSK1761002A  (M33)  to  be  a  functional  inhibitor  of  cloned  mAChR-1  and  mAChR-3 
(~10-fold  less  potent  than  GSK573719  [pA2  value  of  9.87])  while  GSK339067  had  negligible 
pharmacological  activity  (antagonist  potency  [pIC 50]  was  ≤6.25  against  mAChR-1,  mAChR-2  and 
mAChR-3).  GSK1761002A  (M33)  and  GSK339067A  (M14)  were  shown  to  have  no  direct  stimulatory 
affect at any of the mAChR tested. 
In Vivo Studies 
Mice 
A study in a murine model of MCh-induced bronchoconstriction evaluated the potency and duration of 
action  of  GSK573719  (Report  CH2006/00018).  Conscious  Balb/c  mice  (4/group)  were  pre-treated  at 
before MCh challenge with vehicle (0.9% saline, 50 mcgL/mouse, intranasally) or GSK573719 (0.005, 
0.01,  0.05,  0.1,  0.5,  1.0  and  5  mcg/mouse,  intranasally).  After  dosing  the  mice  were  placed  into 
individual  plethysmograph  chambers  where  airway  responsiveness  (PENH)  to  a  MCh  challenge  was 
measured. The ED 50 was 0.02 mcg/mouse at 5 hours post-treatment. 
In  a  time  response  study,  mice  were  treated  with  GSK573719  (0.05  mcg/mouse,  intranasally)  and 
inhibition of bronchoconstriction evaluated at 0.25, 5, 24 hours and each 24 hours thereafter until 168 
hours  (Day  7)  after  the  initial  dose.  A  single  dose  of  0.05  mcg  of  GSK573719  inhibited  MCh-induced 
bronchoconstriction for up to 7 days. A significant level of inhibition (p<0.001) was maintained (range 
= 47 to 80%) from 5 to 72 hours post-treatment. In a separate parallel experiment, a single dose of 
0.05 mcg of tiotropium also inhibited bronchoconstriction for up to 7 days. The level of inhibition was 
maintained between 46 to 92% inhibition (p<0.001) from 5 to 72 hours post-treatment.  
GSK573719  did  not  inhibit  MCh-induced  bronchoconstriction  when  given  orally  at  a  dose  of  50 
mcg/mouse (2.0 mg/kg in water).  
Repeated  daily  dosing  of  GSK573719  (0.025  mcg,  intranasally)  for  a  period  of  5  consecutive  days  to 
mice did not enhance efficacy after the first day of dosing. The drug was then allowed to washout for 5 
days and on Day 11 a single dose of 0.025 mcg of GSK573719 was again administered. A similar level 
of inhibition was observed on Day 11 (35%, p<0.01 bronchoprotection) compared to that obtained on 
the  first  day  (34%,  p<0.001  bronchoprotection).  These  data  provide  no  evidence  for  muscarinic 
receptor tolerance after repeat dosing under the experimental conditions used. 
Guinea pigs: 
A  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  effect  of  locally  administered  GSK573719  on  ACh  aerosol-
induced bronchoconstriction in conscious Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs (Report CH2005/00954). A dose-
response relationship for the determination of duration of action of GSK573719 (0.25, 2.5 and 25 mcg) 
was established and a side by side study to compare with tiotropium at the same dose (2.5 mcg) was 
performed.  GSK573719  dose-dependently  inhibited  ACh-induced  bronchoconstriction  and  exhibited  a 
dose-related  duration  of  action.  The  highest  dose  of  GSK573179,  25  mcg/animal,  caused  inhibition 
greater  than  50%  up  to  5  days  post-treatment.  The  duration  of  inhibition  for  GSK573719  and 
tiotropium  was  evaluated  in  side  by  side  studies  after  administration  of  2.5  mcg/animal  doses  to 
groups of guinea pigs and was compared to animals receiving vehicle only. Greater than 90% inhibition 
was  observed  at  4  hours  post  dosing  for  both  compounds.  At  24  hours,  GSK573719  and  tiotropium 
Assessment report

exhibited 68.9% ± 11.3 (mean ± standard error of the mean) (p<0.0005) and 87.6% ± 6.5 (p<0.0005) 
inhibition,  respectively,  and  at  48  hours  37.7%  ±  10.2  (p<0.002)  and  65.9%  ±  9.4  (p<0.0005), 
respectively.  At  72  hours,  the  levels  of  inhibition  were  19.1%  ±  8.6  (not  significant)  for  GSK573719 
and 32.4% ± 10.9 (p<0.05) for tiotropium. Levels of inhibition for both compounds were below 20% on 
Days 4 and 5 post-treatment. 
A study  was conducted to determine the effect of intratracheal GSK573719 (0.025, 0.25 or 2.5 mcg) 
on  ACh-induced  bronchoconstriction  and  bradycardia  in  guinea  pigs  (Report  CH2005/00953). 
GSK573719 demonstrated potent activity in inhibiting intravenous ACh-induced bronchoconstriction as 
evidenced  by  a  dose-dependent  shift  of  the  ACh  dose  response.  This  was  represented  as  airway 
resistance measurements (cm H20/ML/sec, mean ± SEM) at the highest dose of ACh (100 mcg/kg) of: 
vehicle  control  =  5.93  ±  1.05;  GSK573719  (0.025  mcg)  =  4.19  ±  0.395;  GSK573719  (0.25  mcg)  = 
1.51 ±  0.266,  p<0.01  vs  control;  GSK573719  (2.5  mcg)  =  0.420  ±  0.0484,  p<0.001  vs  control. 
Tiotropium  (25  mcg/animal,  intratracheally)  demonstrated  activity  similar  to  GSK573719  (2.5 
mcg/animal) in inhibiting ACh-induced bronchoconstriction. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
In vitro studies  
Radioligand binding studies: 
Radioligand  binding  studies  were  performed  to  investigate  the  binding  kinetics  of  3H-GW642444  (as 
the  triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  in  membranes  prepared  from  either  transfected  Chinese 
hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells  expressing  the  human  beta2-receptor  or  from  human  lung  parenchyma. 
GW642444 binds to the human beta2-receptor with high affinity coupled with fast K (pKD range 9.44 
to  10.8)  similar  to  that  of  salmeterol  and  higher  than  R,R-formoterol  and  indacaterol.  Competition 
binding  curves  for  a  range  of  beta2-receptor  agonist  and  antagonists  were  completed  against  3H-
GW642444.  The  pKi  values  determined  were  in  good  agreement  with  literature  values  generated 
against antagonist radioligands.  3H-GW642444M demonstrates a fast koff from the low affinity receptor 
state and a moderately slow koff from the high affinity receptor state at ambient temperature. 
In vitro efficacy: 
GW642444  (as  the  acetate  salt,  GW642444A)  was  assessed  in  a  variety  of  in  vitro  functional  assays 
and  its  potency  compared  with  that  of  salmeterol  and  R,R-formoterol  (beta2-receptor  agonists)  or 
isoprenaline (non-selective beta-agonist). 
GW642444  caused  a  concentration-dependant  pigment  dispersal  in  melatonin  pre-treated  frog 
melanophores  expressing  the  beta2-receptor.    GW642444  was  found  to  be  a  potent  agonist  at  the 
human  beta2-receptor  with  a  slightly  greater  potency  than  salmeterol  and  similar  potency  to  R,R-
formoterol  and  isoprenaline  (log  half-maximal  effective  concentration  (pEC50)  9.3,  8.8,  9.4  and  9.1, 
respectively). 
In  functional  adenyl  cyclase  assays  utilising  CHO  cells  stably  expressing  human  beta2-receptors, 
GW642444  had  a  similar  potency  to  salmeterol.  In  the  CHO  cells  stably  expressing  the  human  beta2 
adrenoceptors  (at  levels  which  allow  for  partial  agonists  to  be  discriminated),  GW642444  has  an 
intrinsic activity greater than salmeterol but lower than R,R-formoterol. The effects of GW642444 were 
also  antagonised  by  propranolol  and  sotalol  in  a  competitive  manner,  with  the  dissociation  constant 
pKbs obtained being similar to those against salmeterol (estimated pKb values for propranolol [9.6 and 
9.7]  and  sotalol  [7.3  and  7.3]  against  salmeterol  and  GW642444,  respectively).  These  data  indicate 
that GW642444 and salmeterol act as orthosteric agonists at the human beta2-receptor. 
In vitro selectivity: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 24/308 
 
  
  
GW642444 (as the acetate salt, GW642444A and the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was assessed 
in  vitro  in  a  Luciferase  reporter  gene  selectivity  assay  or  a  TR-FRET  LANCE  cAMP  assay  in  CHO  cells 
stably expressing human  beta1-, beta2- and human beta3-receptors. Its potency compared with that 
of  salmeterol,  R,R-formoterol  and  indacaterol  (beta2-receptor  agonists)  or  isoprenaline  (non-selective 
beta-agonist).  GW642444  demonstrated  similar  selectivity  to  salmeterol  for  beta2  over  human  beta1 
and  human  beta3-receptors.  GW642444  was  significantly  more  selective  than  R,R-formoterol  and 
indacaterol against human beta1 and human beta3-receptors. 
In vitro onset and duration of action: 
In  assessing  the  potency  and  duration  of  action  of  GW642444,  GW642444  caused  a  concentration 
dependent increase in the TR-FRET LANCE cAMP assay carried out in CHO cells expressing recombinant 
beta2-receptors.  GW642444, salmeterol and indacaterol showed long persistence of action (duration) 
at  the  beta2-receptor  following  washout  in  contrast  to  R,R-formoterol  which  shows  a  significant 
washout profile, indicating a lack of duration in this assay. 
Potency and duration of action of GW642444 was also assessed using guinea  pig trachea and human 
bronchus. GW642444 was shown to be a potent and selective beta2-receptor agonist on the guinea pig 
isolated superfused (electrically stimulated) trachea (pEC50 = 7.87). GW642444 was similar in potency 
(pEC50  =  7.68)  and  duration  to  salmeterol  and  around  30-fold  weaker  than  R,R-formoterol. 
GW642444  has  a  more  rapid  onset  than  salmeterol  and  similar  to  R,R-formoterol  (half  onset  time 
[Ot50] values of 6.6 minutes, 25 minutes and 13 minutes, respectively). The effects of GW642444 on 
guinea pig trachea were antagonised by propranolol and sotalol in a competitive manner. Reassertion 
studies with sotalol were consistent with CHO cell assays and support a long duration of action. Studies 
with  GW642444  on  human  isolated  bronchus  tissues  stimulated  with  either  prostaglandin  F2alpha  or 
methacholine showed a similar potency and duration profile to that seen in guinea pig trachea.   
Characterisation of GW642444 metabolites and S-enantiomer: 
The beta1- and beta2-agonist activity of GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M), its S-
enantiomer (GSK907117), 4 human metabolites (GW630200 [M29], GSK932009 [M33], GSK1676112 
[M20] and GW875428 [M40]) and a further potential metabolite GW853734, was evaluated in TR-FRET 
LANCE assay measuring cAMP production in recombinant CHO cells expressing human beta1- or beta2-
receptors.  The  GW642444  metabolites  GW630200  (M29)  and  GSK932009  (M33)  were  at  least  2500-
fold less potent than GW642444 on the beta2-receptor, and the metabolites GW875428, GSK1676112 
and GW853734 were poorly active with intrinsic activity ~30%, 70% and 50%, respectively, at beta2. 
The  GW642444  S-enantiomer  was  around  60  times  less  potent  at  beta2  than  GW642444. 
Pharmacological activity against the beta2-receptor was negligible for the other GW642444 metabolites 
tested.  None  of  the  metabolites  tested  or  the  S  enantiomer  showed  any  notable  pharmacological 
activity against the beta1-receptor. 
In vivo activity 
The  bronchoprotective  effects  of  GW642444  over  time  were  assessed  using  histamine  challenge  in 
conscious  male  and  female  guinea  pigs  (up  to  8/sex).  Airway  responsiveness  was  measured  using 
whole body plethysmography. GW642444 was a potent and long-acting inhibitor of histamine induced 
bronchospasm in the conscious guinea pig when administered by the inhaled route (nebulised aerosol). 
GW642444  had  a  similar  potency  to  salmeterol  and  at  an  equi-effective  (EC90)  dose  the  duration  of 
action of GW642444 was similar to salmeterol.  
Repeat  dosing  studies  (once  daily/4  days  at  EC90)  induced  tachyphylaxis,  manifest  by  a  parallel 
rightward  shift  in  the  dose-response  curve  which  amounted  to  an  approximate  4-fold  reduction  in 
potency  pretreated  with  GW642444.  This  tachyphylaxis  was  considered  surmountable  and  was 
evidenced near the top of the dose-response curve. Repeated exposure to GW642444 daily for 5 days

at  the  EC90  also  caused  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in the  duration of action  from  10  hours  to 
<4 hours. 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
No  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  studies  were  performed  on  the  fixed  dose  combination 
umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol based on the data available for each compound which was considered 
acceptable.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
In vitro studies 
The  selectivity  of  GSK573719  (1  mcM)  for  a  battery  of  50  enzymes,  receptors,  ion  channels  and 
transporters was assessed in receptogram binding studies utilising radioligand binding assays (Report 
CH2006/00030). Any assay which gave greater than 50% inhibition was further investigated to obtain 
an  IC50  and  Ki  value.  GSK573719  inhibited  radioligand  binding  by  less  than  50%  at  41  of  the  50 
receptors,  ion  channels  and  transporters  screened.  The  Ki  values  for  the  5  targets  that  were  not 
mAChR-1 to mAChR-4 were Kappa opioid receptor (69 nM), Sigma (non-selective) receptor (220 nM), 
Ca2+  channel  (L,  verapamil  site)  (330  nM),  Na+  channel  (Site  2)  (170  nM)  and  dopamine  transporter 
(780 nM). 
In vivo studies 
An  in  vivo  secondary  pharmacology  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  effect  of  intratracheal 
GSK573719  on  ACh-induced  bronchoconstriction  and  bradycardia 
in  guinea  pigs  (Report 
CH2005/00953). The effects on bronchoconstriction are described in the in vivo pharmacology studies 
section above. 
No consistent or dose-related effects were observed on ACh-induced bradycardia following GSK573719 
treatment.  The  lowest  dose  of  GSK573719  (0.025  mcg/animal)  produced  no  significant  inhibition  of 
ACh-induced bradycardia except at the highest dose of ACh (100 mcg/kg; p<0.05). Using higher doses 
of  GSK573719  (0.25  mcg  or  2.5  mcg)  produced  only  one  significant  effect  on  ACh-induced 
bradycardia. This effect was seen at the 2.5 mcg/animal dose of GSK573719 vs 20 mcg/kg ACh dose, 
but at no other doses (p<0.05). Tiotropium at 25 mcg/animal significantly inhibited heart rate changes 
at all doses of ACh (p<0.01). Heart rate changes (beats/min, mean ± SEM) at the highest dose of ACh 
(100 mcg/kg) for each group were: vehicle control = 148 ± 8.2; GSK573719 (0.025 mcg) = 123 ± 5.8;

There  were  no  findings  relevant  to  human  safety  at  the  proposed  clinical  dose  in  inhaled  respiratory 
safety  pharmacology  studies  with  GSK573719.  Single  inhaled  administration  of  GSK573719  (215  or 
2260  mcg/kg)  produced  reversible  minimal  effects  on  ventilatory  function  in  rats  during  the  1  hour 
pulmonary exposure. As the method of administration (1 hour exposure) differs considerably from that 
proposed clinically (DPI) and that a safety margin of 5.7 exists between Cmax at the NOAEL and the 
Cmax achieved at the maximum proposed commercial inhaled dose of 125 mcg/day, these effects are 
not considered relevant for human safety. 
In  cardiovascular  safety  pharmacology  studies,  known  pharmacological  responses  to  muscarinic 
antagonists  including  altered  ion  channel  activities  in  vitro  and  a  number  of  cardiovascular  effects 
including tachycardia in vivo were observed at exposures well in excess of those achieved clinically at 
the  highest  dose.  In  the  hERG  assay,  GSK573719  was  a  weak  inhibitor  of  this  cardiac  potassium 
channel at a nominal IC50 value of 9.41 mcM (safety margin of 250,000). 
Increases  in  heart  rate  were  observed in  the  cardiovascular  safety  pharmacology  study  in  dogs  at  an 
intravenous  dose  of  10  mcg/kg.  At  this  dose,  a  prolongation  of  PR  interval  together  with  transient 
second  degree  AV  block  followed  by  a  decrease  of  RR  interval  was  also  noted.  At  the  NOAEL  (3 
mcg/kg) a safety margin of ~163 exists based on Cmax at the maximum proposed commercial dose. 
In addition, no evidence of QT prolongation was seen at exposures >600-fold higher than the human 
Cmax at the proposed commercial dose of 125 mcg. 
In repeat dose inhaled toxicity studies with GSK573719 in the dog, increased pulse rates/heart rates, 
generally  accompanied  with  the  secondary  loss  of  respiratory  sinus  arrhythmia,  were  observed  
however no additional treatment-related ECG waveform abnormalities were seen at doses up to 2254 
mcg/kg/day (equating to ~388-fold safety margin).  
The  existence  of  adequate  safety  margins  are  reflected  in  the  available  clinical  data.  There  were  no 
clinically  relevant  changes 
from  baseline 
in  heart  rate 
in  the  subjects  with  COPD  with 
GSK573719/GW642444  (125/25  and  62.5/25  mcg/day,  respectively)  or  GSK573719  (125  and  62.5 
mcg/day) compared with placebo. In the thorough QT study in healthy volunteers, the maximum mean 
time matched change in heart rate for GSK573719 (500 mcg) compared with placebo was 2.1 bpm at 
8 hours post dose (90% CI: 0.7, 3.5).

Rat 
Conscious  male  Sprague  Dawley  rats  were  intravenously  administered  with  single  dose  of  vehicle  or 
GW642444H. Animals were observed for peripheral and central nervous systems activities (e.g. motor 
activity,  behaviour,  co-ordination,  somatic  sensory/motor  reflex  responses  and  automatic  responses 
such  as  piloerection,  pupil  size,  lachrymation,  salivation,  overt  cardiovascular  and  gastrointestinal 
effects) and potential effects on body temperature.  
In  other  study  also  performed  in  conscious  male  Sprague  Dawley  CD  rats,  GW642444M  was 
administered  as  a  single  dose  via  snout-only  inhalation.  Animals  were  subjected  to  neurobehavioural 
observations  using  a  standard  observation  battery,  quantitative  motor  activity  evaluations  and  the 
recording  of  body  temperature.  Body  temperature  and  neurobehavioural  endpoints  were  monitored 
before  dosing  (to obtain  baseline  measurements),  and  subsequently  at  1.25, 3  and  9  hours  from  the 
start  of  exposure  while  motor  activity  was  evaluated  before  the  dosing  and  at  1.25,  9  and  25  hours

inhibited  hERG 
GW642444 
in  a 
concentration-dependent  manner.  At  30.7  mcM 
GW642444 inhibited hERG tail current completely. 
The IC25, IC50 and IC75 values for GW642444 inhibition 
of  hERG  tail  current  were  2.0,  4.8  and  12.6  mcM 
(0.99, 2.3 and 6.1 mcg/mL), respectively. 
At stimulation frequencies of 0.5 and 1 Hz, exposure 
to GW642444 at concentrations of 1 and 10 mcM 
caused a concentration-dependant depolarization of 
RMP and decreases in UA, MRD and APD. At 100 mcM 
GW642444 action potentials could not be elicited in 3 
of the 4 test substance treated fibres. In the 
remaining fibre RMP, UA and APD were further 
reduced compared to the effects observed at 10 mcM 
GW642444 (the effect on MRD was similar to the 
effects observed at 10 mcM) at 1 Hz. This fibre 
became spontaneous at 0.5 Hz. Due to these effects 
meaningful statistical analysis could not be performed 
at 0.5 and 3 Hz. 
These results are consistent with inhibition of cardiac 
potassium (IK1) and sodium channels although an 
additional inhibition of cardiac calcium channels 
cannot be ruled out.

1 mcg/kg, reductions in PR, RR, QT and QTcL interval, 
attributed to the changes in heart rate. At 0.1 mcg/kg, 
very small prolongation of QT and QTcL interval. QTcL 
increased  by  approximately  6  msecs  and  returned  to

Effects on QT interval. hERG assay 
The  potential  capacity  of  GW642444H  to  inhibit  hERG  tail  current  was  evaluated  by  whole  cell  patch 
clamp method in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with hERG cDNA. Peak hERG tail current amplitude 
was measured prior to and following exposure to GW642444H, DMSO, (vehicle) or E-4031 (0.1 mcM; 
an inhibitor of hERG tail current) using 4 to 5 cells/concentration.  
Effect on QT interval. Purkinje fibre assay 
In other in vitro study using beagle dog isolated Purkinje fibres, the effects of GW642444H on cardiac 
action  potential,  including action  potential duration  at  60  and 90%  repolarization  (ADP60  and  ADP90), 
resting  membrane  potential  (RMP),  maximum  rate  of  depolarisation  (MRD)  and  upstroke  amplitude 
(UA) was examined. All mentioned parameters were measured at 1 and 0.5 Hz, except MRD that was 
measured at 3 Hz in the presence of vehicle or GW642444 at 100 mcM.  
In vivo studies 
Dog  
GW642444H was administered intravenously to conscious male beagle dogs to evaluate its effects on 
arterial  pressures,  heart  rate,  and  electrocardiograph  parameters.  Cardiovascular  function  and  ECG 
parameters  were  monitored  via  telemetry  from  30  minutes  prior  to  dosing,  during  the  1  minute 
infusion period and for 4 hours after dosing.  
In  conscious  male  beagle  dog  the  effects  of  GW642444M  in  the  cardiovascular  function  and  ECG 
parameters  were  also  evaluated.  Systolic,  diastolic  and  mean  blood  pressure,  pulse  pressure,  heart 
rate  and  ECG  parameters were  monitored  via  telemetry  from 30  minutes  before  dosing,  during the 1 
minute infusion period and for 4 hours after dosing. ECG waveforms were observed for any abnormal 
changes in rhythm or morphology.

The  effects  of  GW642444H  on  the  respiratory  system  were  evaluated  in  conscious  male  Sprague-
Dawley CD rats. T tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute volume were the  respiratory parameters 
monitored before the dosing and at approximately 24 and 48 hours after exposure to the product.  
In other study in conscious male Sprague-Dawley CD rats was also evaluate the effects of GW642444M 
on the respiratory. The tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute volume were respiratory parameters 
evaluated and measured prior to dosing, continuously during the 1 hour and for approximately 1 hour 
at approximately 24 hours post-exposure.  
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
To  investigate  any  potential  for  synergistic  effects  on  cardiovascular  parameters,  a  dog  intravenous

GSK573719 as measured by either the AUC0-t and/or Cmax when dosed alone or in combination.

combination compared to the individual components alone.

There were no ECG changes that were unique to the GSK573719/GW642444 combination in either the 
dog cardiovascular safety pharmacology study or the inhaled combination toxicity studies.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  non-clinical  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  performed  to  specifically  evaluate  possible 
interactions of GSK573719 or GW642444 with other drugs that may be co-administered.  
Various  in  vitro  assays  have  demonstrated  that  GSK573719  is  a  potent,  competitive,  pan-active 
mAChR  receptor  antagonist  and  that  GW642444  is  a  potent  and  selective  beta2  receptor  agonist. 
Secondary  pharmacology  studies  evaluating  the  selectivity  of  GSK573719  or  GW642444  using  a 
standardized  panel  of  receptors  and  channels  suggested  that  neither  compound  is  likely  to  produce 
biological effects unrelated to their primary activity. 
Based  on  the  high  selectivity  of  the  two  compounds  to  their  native  receptors,  and  the  low  plasma 
concentrations  within  the efficacious  dose  range  (as  a  consequence of  the  low  inhaled dose  and  their 
subsequent  high  rate  of  clearance  from  the  bloodstream  as  well  as  the  poor  oral  bioavailability),  the 
potential for pharmacodynamic drug interactions is considered small. The use of LABAs and LAMAs as 
human  medicines  is  well  documented  and  known  potential  drug  interactions  are  described  in  the 
prescribing information. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Validated  analytical  methods  utilising  LC-MS/MS  were  employed  to  ensure  the  specific  and  accurate 
quantification  of  GSK573719  and  GW642444  in  the  plasma  of  non-clinical  species.  Assays  were 
developed and validated in mouse, rat, rabbit and dog plasma.  Analytical ranges of  0.02 or 0.1 to 100 
ng/mL  for  both  compounds  enabled  the  definition  of  systemic  exposure  across  the  dose  ranges  used 
throughout the nonclinical program for both compounds. 
In  examining  the  metabolic  profile  of  GSK573719  14C  labels  were  used  and  were  studied  using  high 
performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC)  with  either  on-line  or  off-line  radiochemical  detection.  
Studies  to  identify  the  metabolites  in  theses  samples  were  performed  using  1H-nuclear  magnetic 
resonance (NMR), LC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Radio-chromatographic profiles in selected extracts of human 
plasma samples were obtained by off-line radio-detection using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) 
as a sensitive radio-detector. 
For  GW642444,  radiolabelled  metabolite  profiles  were  generated  using  HPLC  with  either  on-line  or 
offline radiochemical detection. Off-line radio-detection generally involved eluate fractionation followed 
by  scintillation  counting.  In  the  human  ADME  study  low  radioactivity  concentrations  necessitated  the 
use of AMS as a sensitive radio-detector. Metabolites were identified (where possible) using LC-MS and 
LC-MS/MS  and  1HNMR.  For  a  number  of  metabolites,  however,  identification  was  not  possible  using 
these  techniques  because  of  the  low  chemical  mass.  The  structures  of  some  metabolites,  therefore, 
have been assigned by comparison of chromatographic retention times with either authentic standards 
or  metabolites  identified  in  other  studies.  The  sensitivity  of  the  assays  used  was  such  that  it  was 
possible  to  follow  the  time  course  of  GW642444  in  the  body  and  thus  obtain  meaningful 
pharmacokinetic profiles.

species  with  Tmax  generally  at  the  first  sample  taken  after  the  end  of  the  inhalation  period.  Oral 
absorption of GSK573719 was very low in both rat and dog. Oral bioavailability was negligible in rats 
and dogs such that it could not be determined (Reports CH2006/00004 and CH2006/00001) indicating 
that systemic exposure from the swallowed portion of an inhaled dose in animals will be negligible. In a 
rat excretion study, only 0.3% of administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and bile following 
oral  administration  of  14C-GSK573719.  In  a  dog  excretion  study,  absorption  was  less  than  5%  based 
on a comparison of radioactive recovery in dog urine following oral and intravenous administration of 
14C-GSK573719 (Report FD2005/00164). 
Studies in mice and rats showed that oral bioavailability was also limited by first-pass metabolism. In 
mice  dosed  orally  with  14C-GSK573719,  it  was  shown  that  levels  of  radioactive  drug-related  material 
(DRM)  were  lower  in  the  systemic  circulation  compared  to  those  in  the  hepatic  portal  vein  (Report 
WD2008/00001). In rats administered GSK573719 via the hepatic portal vein, systemic concentrations 
of  GSK573719  were  much  lower  compared  to  when  administered  into  a  peripheral  vein  (report 
CH2006/00012). 
Oral  absorption  of  GSK573719  in  humans,  as  in  animals,  was  negligible,  with  no  quantifiable 
concentrations  of  GSK573719  following  oral  administration  of  1000  mcg.  Similarly,  the  absorption  of 
DRM was low following administration of 14C-GSK573719, with the estimated oral bioavailability based 
on  plasma  radioactivity  levels  being  approximately  5%.  Absorption  was  less  than  5%  based  on  a 
comparison  of  radioactivity  recovery  in  human  urine  following  oral  and  intravenous  administration  of 
14C-GSK573719. The low human oral bioavailability was primarily mediated by poor absorption (studies 
AC4112008 and AC4112014). 
Single dose:  
Following  intravenous  administration,  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  GSK573719  were  similar 
across  all  species  investigated  with  a  high  clearance  (in  excess  of  liver  blood  flow,  indicating 
extrahepatic  clearance  routes  such  as  direct  renal  secretion)  and  a  large  volume  of  distribution 
(exceeding  body  water),  indicating  extensive  distribution  into  tissues  (Rat  -  Reports  CH2006/00004 
and WD2006/00073; Dog - Reports CH2006/00001 and WD2006/00075). 
Repeat dose:  
The  toxicokinetics  of  GSK573719  were  investigated  in  repeat  dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies  in  mice, 
rats, rabbits and dogs for up to 26, 26, 2 and 39 weeks duration, respectively (Reports 2012N131664, 
FD2009/00467, WD2006/03186 and FD2009/00466).  
Inter-animal  and  inter-study  variability  of  systemic  exposure  to  GSK573719  was  relatively  high  as  is 
typical following inhalation administration. The variability was particularly notable in the dog, in which 
oropharyngeal  tube  inhalation  was  used  to  administer  GSK573719  in  the  pivotal  studies  ≥13  weeks. 
The mean data, however, consistently showed the same trends between studies.  
Systemic exposure to GSK573719 in toxicity studies was considerably greater in most cases than that 
in  humans  at  the  proposed  doses.  Generally,  systemic  exposure  to  GSK573719  following  inhalation 
administration to mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and humans increased with increasing dose in a proportional 
manner. There were occasions where the increase in systemic exposure was sub- or supra-proportional 
between individual dose levels (two 7-day toxicity studies in the rat and a 14-day toxicity study in the 
dog - Reports WD2004/01556, WD2005/01063 and WD2006/03228 respectively). 
There  was  little  evidence  of  accumulation  (greater  than  2-fold)  of  GSK573719  on  repeat 
administration, although increases in systemic exposure (AUC0-t) were occasionally observed at higher 
dose  levels  (Reports  2011N111874,  WD2006/03669  and  WD2005/01423).  Overall,  there  were  no 
Assessment report

marked  or  consistent  differences  in  systemic  exposure  between  the  sexes  in  the  mouse,  rat  or  dog. 
There  were  no  marked  changes  in  systemic  exposure  with  time  or  gender  following  repeated 
administration of GSK573719 in human studies. Tmax usually occurred immediately following the end of 
the inhalation dosing period in all species, indicating rapid absorption across the lung. 
Replacement of cellobiose octaacetate with magnesium stearate as an excipient in the rat and dog did 
not  result  in  notable  changes  to  systemic  exposure  of  GSK573719  (Reports  WD2006/03225  and 
WD2006/03669).  
Systemic  exposure  was  also  unchanged  in  dogs  receiving  inhalation  administration  and  fed  a  wetted 
diet  compared  to  a  dry  diet,  which  was  a  change  implemented  during  the  toxicology  programme  in 
dogs with GSK573719 (Report WD2006/03294). 
Systemic  exposure  following  subcutaneous  (rat  and  pregnant  rabbit)  and  intravenous  (rat  and  dog) 
administration  established  systemic  exposures  greater  than  those  achieved  clinically  (Reports 
FD2008/00339,  RD2009/01098,  RD2009/01099,  2011N111874,  CD2009/00970  and  CD2010/00235; 
FD2008/00365).  
Two 13 week mouse oral studies were conducted with GSK573719 to assess the suitability of this route 
of administration for a carcinogenicity study. Given that GSK573719 has been shown to have poor oral 
absorption and that the systemic exposure at oral doses suitable for a lifetime study were predicted to 
lower  than  those  that  could  be  obtained  following  inhaled  dosing,  inhaled  administration  was  chosen 
for use in a carcinogenicity study. At the doses used in the mouse toxicity studies, the majority of the 
compound would have remained unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Absorption of GW642444 from the lung following inhalation administration was rapid in all non-clinical 
species  with  Tmax  generally  at  the  first  sample  taken  after  the  end  of  the  inhalation  period.  Oral 
absorption  of  14C-GW642444  was  good  in  both  rat  and  dog  with  at  least  37%  and  56%  orally 
absorbed  in  BDC  rats  and  intact  dogs,  respectively.  Oral  bioavailability  of  GW642444,  however,  was 
low in the rat (1.1%) and moderate in the dog (29.7%). Hepatic portal vein plasma concentrations of 
GW642444 in mice and rats suggest that first-pass hepatic clearance limits oral bioavailability in these 
species.  Oral  bioavailability  in  the  rat  is,  therefore,  limited  mainly  by  first  pass  hepatic  clearance  as 
well  as  incomplete  absorption.  The  higher  oral  bioavailability  (and  lower  blood  clearance,)  in  the  dog 
suggests  that  a  greater  proportion  of  the  swallowed  component  escapes  first  pass  hepatic  clearance 
and,  as  a  result,  the  oral  component  in  the  dog  is  likely  to  make  a  larger  contribution  to  systemic 
exposure following inhalation administration. 
Oral  absorption  of  GW642444  in  human,  as  in  animals,  was  good  with  at  least  50%  orally  absorbed 
based  on  urinary  recovery  of  DRM  following  administration  of  14C-GW642444  in  solution  (study 
B2C106181). Exposure to GW642444 represented a very small percentage (in the region of <0.5%) of 
DRM in plasma indicating that the low human oral bioavailability (< 2%), was mediated by extensive 
first pass metabolism. 
Differences  in  blood  clearance  of  GW642444  was  observed  in  rat,  dog  and  human  and  ranged  from 
moderate in the rat (35% of rat liver blood flow of 90 mL/min/kg), lower in the dog (26% of dog liver 
blood flow of 40 mL/min/kg ) and high in human (> human liver blood flow). The steady state volume 
of distribution of GW642444 was high in the rat and human but moderate in the dog, exceeding total 
body water in all species. 
In  repeat  dose  inhalation  studies  using  dry  powder  formulations,  systemic  exposure  to  GW642444 
(AUC0-t  and  Cmax)  increased  with  increasing  dose  in  a  proportional  or  less  than  dose-proportional 
manner;  subproportionality  was  generally  associated  with  higher  doses.  There  was  little  evidence  of 
Assessment report

accumulation  of  GW642444  exposure  with  time,  although  increased  AUC0-t  values  were  occasionally 
observed  upon  repeat  dosing  in  some  of  the  rat  studies.  Overall,  there  were  no  marked  changes  in 
systemic  exposure  between  males  and  females  in  the  mouse,  rat  or  dog.  There  were  no  marked 
changes in systemic exposure with time or gender, following repeated administration of GW642444 in 
human.  Tmax  was  generally  at  the  first  sample  time  after  the  end  of  the  inhalation  period  indicating 
rapid  absorption  across  the  lung.  Exposure  to  GW642444  in  animal  toxicity  studies  was  considerably 
greater (in most cases) than following proposed dose of GW642444 to human. 
Inclusion  of  magnesium  stearate  as  an  excipient  in  rat  and  dog  vehicle  formulations  for  inhalation 
studies did not result in notable changes to systemic exposure. 
Systemic exposure (AUC0-t and Cmax) to GI179710 (the triphenylacetate counter-ion of GW642444M 
triphenylacetate  salt)  following  inhalation  administration of  GW642444M increased  proportionally  with 
dose in rats and dogs but less than proportionally in the mouse. In the rat, there was some evidence 
for  accumulation  on  repeat  dosing  but  not  in  the  mouse  or  dog.  Overall,  in  the  majority  of  studies, 
there were no differences in systemic exposure between genders. 
In repeat dose clinical studies where asthma and  COPD patients were administered at doses of up to 
50 mcg GW642444M, concentrations of GI179710 were below the limits of quantification (1 ng/mL) in 
the  majority of  subjects. Cmax  concentrations  of  GI179710  on  repeat  dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies 
(mean of males/females over whole study at the highest dose level administered) were > 1000 ng/mL 
in the mouse and rat and > 200 ng/mL in the dog and pregnant rabbit. Large systemic exposure ratios 
for GI179710, relative to human, have, therefore been established in toxicology studies. 
Systemic  exposure  (AUC0-t  and  Cmax)  to  Human  metabolites  GW630200  (M29)  and  GSK932009 
(M33) generally increased with increasing dose in either a proportional or less than dose-proportional 
manner. Mice, rats and dogs were all exposed to both metabolites with metabolite:parent ratios (based 
on  AUC0-t)  of  0.002  to  0.01  for  GW630200  (M29)  and  0.02  to  0.08  for  GSK932009  (M33).  No 
consistent difference in exposure to metabolites was observed between males and females.  
In repeat dose clinical studies where asthma and COPD patients were administered doses of up to 50 
mcg GW642444M by the inhalation route, concentrations of GW630200 (M29) and GSK932009 (M33) 
were below the limits of quantification (0.09 and 0.18 ng/mL, respectively) in the majority (99.8%) of 
subjects.  Cmax  concentrations  of  GW630200  (M29)  and  GSK932009  (M33)  observed  in  non-clinical 
repeat dose inhalation toxicity studies (at the highest dose level administered as recommended in ICH 
M3(R2)  were  >  0.7  ng/mL  for  GW630200  (M29)  and  >  3  ng/mL  for  GSK932009  (M33)  in  the  rat, 
mouse  and  dog.  Mice,  rat  and  dogs  have,  therefore,  been  exposed  to  higher  concentrations  of  these 
metabolites compared to human. 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
Inhalation:  
The toxicokinetics of GSK573719 and GW642444 have been investigated following repeated inhalation 
administration of GSK573719 and GW642444 (triphenylacetate salt) in combination to Sprague Dawley 
rats for 4 weeks (Report FD2009/00392) and beagle dogs for 4 and 13 weeks (Reports FD2009/00391; 
2010N109790 and WD2010/00677 respectively). The combination of GSK573719 and GW642444 was 
administered  as  a  dry  powder  formulation  in  lactose  mostly  including  magnesium  stearate  as  an 
excipient to aid stability which represents the proposed clinical formulation.  
In rats (12/sex/group), GSK573719 was generally quantifiable in plasma up to 24 hours from the start 
of  exposure.  GW642444  was  generally  quantifiable  in  plasma  up  to  9  and  24  hours,  respectively,  at 
estimated  achieved  doses  of  60.7  and  1040  mcg/kg/day.  There  were  very  limited  quantifiable 
concentrations of GW642444 at the lowest dose (4.37 mcg/kg/day) and therefore it was not possible

to define the systemic exposure in these rats. For both compounds, Tmax generally occurred within 30 
minutes  following  the  1  hour  dosing  period.  Generally,  there  was  no  notable  difference  (>2-fold)  in 
systemic  exposure  (as  measured  by  DNAUC0-t  and DNCmax)  for  GSK573719 when  administered  alone 
or in combination with GW642444. However, there was a trend for systemic exposure of GW642444 to 
be  lower  when  administered  in  combination  with  GSK573719.  Systemic  exposure  to  GW642444 
increased  in  approximate  proportion  with  increasing  dose  between  60.7  and  1040  mcg/kg/day  when 
co-administered  with  GSK573719.  There  was  no  notable  difference  in  systemic  exposure  for  either 
GSK573719 or GW642444 across the duration of the study between Day 1 and Week 4 or between the 
sexes. 
Systemic  exposure  to  GSK573719  or  GW642444  (AUC0-t  and  Cmax)  was  not  markedly  different  when 
dosed  in  combination  compared  to  when  dosed  alone  by  the  inhalation  route  to  dogs.  In  a  4-week 
inhalation toxicity study in dogs (3/sex/group), GSK573719 and GW642444 were generally quantifiable 
in plasma over the sampling period up to 24 hours from start of exposure. For both compounds, Tmax 
generally occurred immediately after the end of the dosing period at 10 minutes. Generally, there was 
no notable difference (2-fold) in systemic exposure (as measured by DNAUC0-t and DNCmax) for either 
GSK573719  or  GW642444  when  administered  in  the  presence  or  absence  of  the  other  compound. 
Overall,  there  was  no  obvious  consistent  trend,  suggesting  a  difference  in  systemic  exposure  (as 
measured  by  DNAUC0-t  and  DNCmax)  for  either  GSK573719  or  GW642444  across  the  duration  of  the 
study between Day 1 and Week 4 or between the sexes in any of the dose groups. 
In a second 4-week inhalation toxicity study in dogs (3/sex/group) conducted to compare two different 
dosing  regimens  with  or  without  a  3  day  pre-adaptive  phase  at  a  lower  dose  of  GW642444  (Report 
2010N109790),  GSK573719  and  GW642444  were  generally  quantifiable  in  plasma  up  to  at  least  24 
hours and 8 hours from the start of dosing, respectively. For both compounds, Tmax generally occurred 
immediately  after  the  end  of  the  dosing  period  at  10  minutes.  There  was  notable  variability  in  the 
systemic  exposure  to  both  GSK573719  and  GW642444  between  dogs  receiving  the  same  dose  as 
shown with the range of DNAUC0-t and DNCmax values on both sampling occasions. There was generally 
no consistent difference in systemic exposure (as measured by DNAUC0-t and DNCmax) to GW642444 or 
GSK573719  when  administered  without  or  with  the  3  day  GW642444  tolerance  dosing  phase. 
Generally,  there  was  no  consistent  difference  in  the  mean  systemic  exposure  (as  measured  by 
DNAUC0-t and DNCmax) to either GSK573719 or GW642444 across the study or between the sexes in 
either dose group, with the range of values overlapping. 
In a 13-week inhalation toxicity study in dogs (4/sex/group) (Report WD2010/00677) GSK573719 was 
generally  quantifiable  in  plasma  up  to  24  hours  following  a  daily  administration  of  GSK573719  at 
achieved doses of 60 mcg/kg/day and above. In dogs receiving an achieved dose of 23.3 mcg/kg/day 
GSK573719,  there  were  sparse  data  with  quantifiable  concentrations  up  to  2  hours  only.  For  both 
compounds,  Tmax  generally  occurred  immediately  after  the  end  of  the  dosing  period  at  10  minutes. 
GW642444 was generally quantifiable in plasma up to 24 hours from start of exposure. Although there 
was  notable  variability  in  the  systemic  exposure  to  both  GSK573719  and  GW642444  within  dogs 
receiving the same dose, generally the mean systemic exposure to both GSK573719 and GW642444, 
in  terms  of  DNAUC0-t  and  DNCmax,  increased  in  approximate  proportion  with  increasing  dose. 
Generally, there was no consistent difference in systemic exposure to either GSK573719 or GW642444 
across  the  study  or  between  the  sexes  for  either  GSK573719  or  GW642444.  Furthermore,  there  was 
generally  no  consistent  difference  in  systemic  exposure  to  GSK573719  or  GW642444  when 
administered in the presence or absence of the other compound.

The  toxicokinetics  of  GSK573719  and  GW642444  (triphenylacetate  salt)  in  combination  were 
investigated  in  a  dose-ranging  embryofetal  study  in  New  Zealand  White  rabbits  (4/F/group) 
administered on Days 7 to 19 pc via the subcutaneous route (Report CD2009/00970).  
GSK573719 was quantifiable in plasma up to at least 4 hours after a dose of 20 mcg/kg/day and up to 
24  hours  after  doses  of  100  to  1500  mcg/kg/day.  The  Cmax  was  generally  observed  at  0.25  hours, 
which was the first sampling occasion, at all doses. Systemic exposure (as determined by AUC0-t and 
Cmax) to GSK573719 increased in approximate proportion with dose across the dose range. There was 
no notable difference in systemic exposure to GSK573719 when administered alone or in combination 
with GW642444. GW642444 was quantifiable in plasma up to 24 hours. 
Intravenous: 
In  the  dog  (4/M/group)  safety  pharmacology  study  (Report  FD2008/00365),  GSK573719  was  only 
quantifiable to between 1 and 5 minutes after dosing whilst GW642444 was quantifiable for up to 30 
minutes  after  dosing.  Tmax  for  GSK573719  and  GW642444  occurred  at  1  minute,  which  was  the  first 
sampling occasion after administration. It was not possible to determine AUC0-t for GSK573719 due to 
there  being  only  sparse  data.  There  were  no  notable  differences  in  systemic exposure  to  GSK573719 
or  GW642444,  as  measured  by  either  the  AUC0-t  and/or  Cmax,  when  either  was  dosed  alone  or  in 
combination. 
Distribution 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
In vitro 
Plasma protein binding  
The  in  vitro  plasma  protein  binding  of  GSK573719  (5,  25,  200  ng/mL)  was  studied  in  mouse,  rat, 
rabbit,  dog  and  human  plasma  (Report  WD2008/00503)  using  equilibrium  dialysis.  The  concentration 
of  GSK573719  in  the  spiked  plasma  and  dialysate  was  determined  by  HPLC-MS/MS.  The  plasma 
protein binding (87.6%, 85.6%, 76.4%, 80.2% and 87.9% in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human, 
respectively) was moderate in all species and independent of concentration. 
In  a  second  study,  the  plasma  protein  binding  of  GSK573719  (2  ng/mL)  was  investigated  in  plasma 
obtained  from  healthy  subjects  (male  and  female),  severe  renally  impaired  subjects  and  severe 
hepatically impaired subjects (Report 2012N144582). In addition, the protein binding of GSK573719 (1 
ng/mL)  was  also  investigated  in  incubations  with  individual  human  plasma  proteins:  human  serum 
albumin  (40  mg/mL),  α-acid  glycoprotein  (0.8  mg/mL)  and  γ-globulin  (7  mg/mL)  dissolved  in 
phosphate  buffered  saline.  The  concentration  of  GSK573719  in  respective  dialysates  and  original 
incubations  were  determined  using  solid  phase  extraction  by  HPLC-MS/MS.  Protein  binding  of 
GSK573719  was  similar  in  incubations  of  plasma  obtained  from  healthy  male  and  female  subjects  as 
well  as  the  renally  and  hepatically  impaired  human  subjects  ranging  from  87.5  to  95.9%  bound. 
GSK573719  was  moderately  bound  to  human  serum  albumin  (67.2%),  γ-globulin  (64.6%)  α-acid 
glycoprotein (84.9%), although the binding was slightly higher to α-acid glycoprotein. 
Blood cell association 
The in vitro blood cell association of 14C-GSK573719 (50, 200, 500 ng/mL) was investigated in mouse, 
rat, rabbit, dog and human blood (Report WD2008/00503). The blood to plasma ratios (0.755, 0.682, 
0.736,  0.525  and  0.551  in  the  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human,  respectively)  were  low  and 
independent of the concentrations in all species examined. The corresponding mean percentage blood 
cell association values were 28.4%, 26.5%, 7.62%, 2.96% and 7.05% for mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and 
human, respectively.

Distribution  of  DRM  into  blood  cells  was  slightly  higher  with  blood  to  plasma  ratios  of  between 
approximately  1  and  2.7  as  observed  in  ex-vivo  samples  taken  following  an  intravenous  infusion  of 
14C-GSK573719 to rats and dogs (Reports FD2005/00208 and FD2005/00164). 
P-glycoprotein transport and membrane permeability 
The  potential  for  human  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)  to  transport  14C-GSK573719  was  investigated  using 
stable transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney II cell line transfected with human MDR1 gene (MDCKII-
MDR1) cells (Report WD2006/02657).  
Directional transport was determined by measurement of apical to basolateral ([A→B]) and basolateral 
to  apical  ([B→A])  rates  of  transport  using  3  mcM  14C-GSK573719  in  the  absence  and  presence  of  2 
mcM  GF120918,  a  potent  P-gp  inhibitor.  The  passive  membrane  permeability  of  14C-GSK573719  was 
determined in the presence of GF120918 over pH range of 5.5 to 7.4 with samples being analysed for 
radioactivity. GSK573719 was a substrate of human P-gp, with an apical efflux ratio ranging from 7 to 
17 and 0.8 in the absence and presence of inhibitor, respectively. GSK573719 was determined to have 
low  passive  membrane  permeability  (average  pH7.4)  of  2.4  ±  0.8  nm/s.  The  passive  membrane 
permeability  of  GSK573719  was  not  affected  over  the  pH  range  investigated.  The  mass  balance  for 
14C-GSK573719  was  76%  for  one  plate  (B→A  direction  only),  however,  this  did  not  affect  the 
conclusion that GSK573719 is a substrate for P-gp. 
Inhibition of P-glycoprotein 
The ability of GSK573719 to inhibit human P-gp-mediated transport of [3H]-digoxin was assessed using 
stable  transfected  MDCKII-MDR1  cells  (Report  WD2006/02596).  GSK573719  did  not  inhibit  transport 
of digoxin via human P-gp in vitro at concentrations up to 100 mcM. 
Organic cation transporters 
An assessment of 14C-GSK573719 as a substrate of human organic cation transporters was performed 
using a human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell line stably transfected with OCT1, OCT2, OCT3, OCTN1 
or OCTN2 genes (Report WD2010/00669). GSK573719 (which is cationic) was found to be a substrate 
for  the  human  organic  cation  transporters  OCT1  and  OCT2,  but  not  OCT3,  OCTN1  or  OCTN2.  Kinetic 
parameters  were  derived  for  OCT1  and  OCT2,  for  OCT1  Km  and  Vmax  were  4.42  mcM  and  476 
pmol/mg/protein/3  minutes,  respectively,  whilst  for  OCT2  the  values  were  0.157  mcM  and  61 
pmol/mg/protein/15 minutes, respectively. Uptake of GSK573719 by OCT1 and OCT2 was shown to be 
inhibited  by  both  MPP+  and  cimetidine  with  IC50  values  of  105  mcM  and  1.4  mcM,  respectively,  for 
OCT1, and 535 mcM and 103 mcM, respectively, for OCT2. OCT1 and OCT2 are predominantly located 
in the liver and kidney, respectively. These data suggest that active transport mediates the distribution 
of  GSK573719  in  vivo  as  it  has  a  low  passive  permeability  in  MDCKII-MDR1  cell  lines  (Report 
WD2006/02657), although their contribution to overall systemic clearance of GSK573719 is unclear. 
In vivo 
P-glycoprotein transport 
A  pharmacokinetic  study was  performed  to  determine  the  influence  of  P-gp  on  the  absorption  of  14C-
GSK573719  (as  the  trifluoroacetate  salt)  following  a  single  oral  or  intravenous  administration  of  14C-
GSK573719  to  male  FVBn  (wildtype  WT)  and  male  mdr1a/1b  (-/-,  P-gp  knockout  KO)  mice  (Report 
WD2008/00001).  14C-GSK573719 was administered as a solution in saline (0.9% w/v) to KO and WT 
mice as a single intravenous bolus administration (9/group) or oral gavage (15/group) at a target dose 
level of 40 mcg/kg.  
The levels of radioactivity (as determined by AUC0-t and Cmax) in the hepatic portal vein and systemic 
plasma  increased  between  13-  and  20-fold  in  the  KO  mice  compared  with  WT  mice,  indicating  that

following  oral  administration  P-gp  plays  a  role  in  the  absorption  of  GSK573719  in  the  mouse. 
Bioavailability  of  GSK573719  radioactive  drug-related  material increased in  WT  mice  compared  to  KO 
mice,  from  1  to  14%.  These  data  are  consistent  with  the  poor  absorption  of  GSK573719  and  P-gp 
having a role in the absorption process. 
Blood, plasma, liver and lung and GI tract concentrations 
Mouse:  A  study  was  performed  to  estimate  the  lung  retention  and  systemic  exposure  of  GSK573719 
(target  dose  level  of  2000  mcg/kg)  in  the  mouse  (20  M)  following  intranasal  administration  (Report 
CH2006/00002).  Concentrations  of  GSK573719  in  the  lung  were  considerably  higher  than  those 
observed in the plasma from 15 minutes to 24 hours post dose (12915 ng/g vs 191 ng/mL at 15 min, 
10612  ng/g  vs  72  ng/mL  at  60  min,  and  2771  ng/g  vs  5  ng/mL  at  24  hr,  in  lung  vs  plasma, 
respectively). 
In  an  excretion  study,  the  levels  of  radioactivity  in  plasma  and  liver  were  determined  following 
administration  of  a  single  intravenous  dose  of  14C-GSK573719  (1000  mcg/kg)  to  CD-1  mice 
(3/M/group)  (Report  2010N105743).  There  was  a  notable  decrease  in  the  level  of  radioactivity 
between  0.25  and  24  hours  post  dose in  both  the  plasma  and  liver,  with  decreases  of  approximately 
150-fold  and  55-fold,  respectively.  There  was  no  notable  accumulation  of  DRM  in  the  liver  of  the 
mouse, with approximately 0.4% of the dose being recovered in the liver at 24 hours post dose. 
Rat: In an excretion study, the levels of radioactivity in blood, plasma, lungs and liver was determined 
following  administration  of  a  single  intravenous  or  single  oral  dose of  14C-GSK573719  (1000  mcg/kg) 
to  Sprague  Dawley  rats  (3/M/group)  (Report  FD2005/00208).  Following  intravenous  administration, 
the  mean  blood:plasma  ratios  increased  from  0.9  to  2.7  between  0.5  to  2  hours,  indicating  an 
increased  association  with  the  cellular  fraction  with  time.  The  highest  levels  of  radioactivity  were 
observed in blood and plasma at 0.5 hours. The levels of DRM in the plasma declined at a faster rate 
than those in the liver or lung. Between 0.5 and 2 hours the liver to plasma and lung to plasma ratios 
of  DRM  increased  from  18  to  92  and  2.1  to  41,  respectively.  Following  oral  administration,  levels  of 
radioactivity in the liver and lungs were quantifiable up to 2 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively, with a 
highest level being 0.003 mcg equivalents/g. Mean levels of DRM in the blood and plasma were below 
the limit of quantification. 
Dog:  In  an  excretion  study,  the  level  of  radioactivity  in  blood  and  plasma  was  determined  following 
administration  of  a  single  intravenous  or  oral  dose  of  14C-GSK573719  (1000  mcg/kg)  to  male  beagle 
dogs  (3/sex/group)  (Report  FD2005/00164).  Following  intravenous  administration,  the  mean 
blood:plasma  ratios  increased  from  1.0  to  2.1  between  1  (end  of  infusion)  to  3  hours,  indicating  an 
increased association with the cellular fraction with time. The highest levels of DRM were observed in 
blood and plasma at 1 hour and were non-quantifiable in plasma by 96 hours. 
Following oral administration, mean levels of radioactivity in blood and plasma were low or below the 
limit of quantification at all time points.  
In another excretion study, the level of radioactivity in blood and plasma was determined following the 
administration  of  a  single  intravenous  dose  of  14C-GSK573719  (as  the  trifluoroacetate  salt)  in  male 
BDC beagle dogs (n=2) (Report WD2007/01907). Following the slow bolus administration, quantifiable 
concentrations of radioactivity in plasma and blood were only observed at the early time points (1 and 
3  minutes  post  dose),  whilst  following  infusion  administration  at  the  higher  dose  level,  quantifiable 
concentrations were observed at all time points investigated (latest time point was 9 hours post dose).  
CNS penetration 
A  study  was  performed  to  determine  the  CNS  penetration  of  GSK573719  following  the  intravenous 
infusion  to  achieve  steady  state  plasma  concentrations  in  the  conscious  rat  (3/M/group)  (Report 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 39/308 
 
  
  
CH2006/00013).  GSK573719  was  administered  as  a  solution  in  20%  aqueous  Cavitron™  (pH  =  5.0) 
containing 1% DMSO as a continuous 24 hours infusion at estimated achieved dose of 24300 mcg/kg. 
Plasma  and  brain  homogenate  concentrations  of  GSK573719  were  quantified  by  LC/MS/MS  (LLQ  =  1 
ng/mL  for  plasma  and  5  ng/mL  for  brain  homogenate,  equivalent  to  15  ng/g  of  brain  tissue). 
GSK573719  was  shown  to  be  present  in  the  brain  at  the  systemic  exposure  levels  achieved  in  this 
study, with brain:plasma ratio of around 1.1 at approximate steady state in the rat. 
Tissue distribution 
Quantitative  whole  body  autoradiography  (QWBA)  in  rats  (Report  FD2005/00236)  was  conducted 
following IV and oral administration. 
Pigmented (Lister Hooded) rats (6/M/group) received a single intravenous infusion over 30 minutes of 
14C-GSK573719  at  a  target  dose level of  1000  mcg/kg.  DRM  was  rapidly  and  widely  distributed,  with 
highest  concentrations  occurring  in  the  majority  of  the  tissues  analysed  at  30  minutes  or  1.5  hours 
after  the  start  of  infusion  (the  first  or  second  sample  time  point).  The  highest  levels  of  radioactivity 
were in the excretory organs, with highest levels in the liver and kidney, these being 6.94 mcg equiv/g 
and  greater  than  the  upper  limit  of  quantification  (>7.03  mcg  equiv/g),  respectively.  In  the  various 
components  of  the  CNS  and  the  testes,  levels  of  radioactivity  were  only  just  above  the  limit  of 
quantification.  In  approximately  half  the  tissues  investigated  the  highest  levels  of  radioactivity  were 
observed  immediately  post  dose,  and  by  35  days  post  dose,  quantifiable  levels  of  radioactivity  were 
only  present  in  the  kidney  medulla,  mucous  gland,  muscle,  tongue  and  uveal  tract  (choroid,  iris  and 
ciliary body)/retina. The presence of DRM in the uveal tract/retina at this time suggests its association 
with melanin. 
Pigmented (Lister Hooded) male rats (6/M/group) received a single oral gavage administration of 14C-
GSK573719  at  a  target  dose  level  of  1000  mcg/kg.  Levels  of  radioactivity  were  below  the  limit  of 
quantification in most tissues, indicating that GSK573719 was poorly absorbed in the rat following oral 
dosing. Excluding components of the gastrointestinal tract, quantifiable levels of radioactivity were only 
observed in the bone surface and marrow at the first sampling time (0.5 hours post dose). Levels in all 
tissues were below the lower limit of quantification (<0.007 mcg equiv/g) by 3 days post dose. 
Milk transfer 
In a pre-post-natal development study, female rats (dams) were administered GSK573719 (10, 60 and 
180 mcg/kg) by the subcutaneous route and plasma concentrations of GSK573719 were measured in 
suckling pups (Report 2011N118595). GSK573719 was quantifiable in plasma in 2 out of 54 pups, and 
below  the  limit  of  quantification  (0.02  ng/mL)  in  the  remaining  pups.  Despite  the  low  incidence  of 
quantifiable  GSK573719  concentrations  in  pups,  transfer  of  GSK573719  via  lactation  cannot  be  ruled 
out. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Plasma Binding:  
In  vitro  plasma  protein  binding  of  GW642444  (parent  form)  was  studied  in  rat,  guinea  pig,  dog  and 
human  plasma  using  equilibrium  dialysis.  Plasma  samples  were incubated  with  0.05  and  0.1  mcg/mL 
GW642444. The dialysates and remaining plasma samples were analysed for GW642444 by HPLC-MS. 
Binding of GW642444 to plasma proteins was moderately high in rats (84%), guinea pigs (92%), dog 
(98%) and human plasma (94%). 
In a second study, plasma protein binding of GW642444 (as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H) 
was investigated at concentrations of 0.005, 0.025, 0.125 or 0.625 mcg/mL in mouse, rat, guinea pig, 
female rabbit, dog and human plasma by equilibrium dialysis. The concentration of GW642444 in the 
dialysate and dialysed plasma, along with the original (non-dialysed) plasma sample, was determined 
Assessment report

Page 40/308 
 
  
  
by  HPLC-MS/MS.  The  extent  of  plasma  protein  binding  was  moderately  high  at  levels  >90%,  and 
appeared  to  be  consistent  across  the  concentration  range  within  all  species  investigated.  The  mean 
plasma protein binding of GW642444 was 94.3, 92.3, 98.9, 93.4, 98.7 and 97.2% in the mouse, rat, 
guinea pig, female rabbit, dog and human, respectively. 
Finally,  protein  binding  of  GW642444  (2  ng/mL  as  the  triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  was 
investigated  by  ultrafiltration  in  incubations  with  human  serum  albumin  (40  mg/mL),  α-acid 
glycoprotein (0.8 mg/mL) and γ-globlin (7 mg/mL) dissolved individually in phosphate buffered saline 
(Report 2011N118910_00).  GW642444 was moderately bound to human serum albumin (60.3%) and 
α-acid glycoprotein (60.8%), whereas the extent of binding to γ-globlin was low (7.9%). 
A study was also performed to examine the in vitro protein binding of 14C-GI179710 (the counter ion 
of  GW642444M  triphenylacetate  salt  -  0.05,  0.2  and  0.5  mcg/mL  )  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and 
human  plasma  using  equilibrium  dialysis.  The  mean  plasma  protein  binding  of  14C-GI179710  was 
95.0,  96.5,  >99,  97.1  and  97.7%  in  the  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human,  respectively.  Extent  of 
binding  was  high  and  appeared  to  be  consistent  across  the  concentration  range  investigated  within 
each species. 
Whole Blood Distribution 
In  an  in  vitro  blood  cell  distribution  study,  GW642444  (0.1  mcg/mL)  was  shown  to  have  a  low 
moderate association with the cellular fraction of rat and human blood (58 to 63% in rat; 35 to 36% in 
human).  The  blood:plasma  ratio  following  30  minutes  incubation  was  1.5:1  and  0.85:1  for  rat  and 
human, respectively. 
Similarly  in  a  definitive  study  conducted  during  drug  development,  the  blood  cell  association  of  14C-
GW642444  (parent  form) was  investigated  at  concentrations  of  0.05,  0.2  and  0.5  mcg/mL  in  mouse, 
rat, guinea pig, female rabbit, dog and human plasma. The extent of blood cell association was low to 
moderate and there was no evidence of any concentration-dependence on association. The mean blood 
to plasma ratios of 14C-GW642444 were 1.0, 1.1, 0.73, 1.0, 0.50 and 0.76 in the mouse, rat, guinea 
pig, female rabbit, dog and human, respectively. The corresponding mean blood cell association values 
were 41.3, 55.9, 15.6, 41.4, 10.7 and 36.1%, respectively. 
For  the  counter  ion of  GW642444M  triphenylacetate  salt  (0.05,  0.2  and 0.5 mcg/mL),  mean  blood  to 
plasma  ratios  were  0.70,  0.63,  0.66,  0.49  and  0.60  in  the  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human, 
respectively.  The  corresponding  mean  percentage  blood  cell  association  values  were  16.8,  14.5,  <1, 
7.4  and  4.4%,  respectively.  Blood  cell  association  of  14C-GI179710  was  low  and  there  was  no 
evidence for any concentration-dependence on association. 
P-glycoprotein transport and membrane permeability: 
GW642444 was screened in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cell line transfected with human MDR1 gene 
(MDCKII-MDR1)  cells  to  assess  whether  it  was  a  substrate  for  human  P-gp.  The  bidirectional 
permeability of GW642444 (5 and 10 mcM), from basolateral to apical (B→A) and apical to basolateral 
(A→B),  was  measured  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  GF120918,  a  known  inhibitor  of  P-gp. 
GW642444  was  determined  to  be  a  substrate  of  human  P-gp  with  B→A/A→B  efflux  ratios  of  33.5  to 
53.7 and 1.4 to1.5 in the absence and presence of GF120918, respectively. 
In  a  second  definitive  study,  the  potential  for  human  P-gp  to  transport  GW642444  (as  the  α-
phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H  -  0.5  mcM.)  was  investigated  using  stable  transfected  MDCKII-
MDR1  cells  in  the  absence  and  presence  of  a  potent  P-gp  inhibitor.  GW642444  was  a  substrate  of 
human  P-gp  (apical  efflux  ratio  of  GW642444  determined  as  ≥25.7  and  0.5  in  the  absence  and 
presence  of  GF120918A,  respectively).  The  passive  membrane  permeability  of  GW642444  (average 
P7.4)  was  of  34  ±  13  nm/s.  A  passive  permeability  of  34  nm/s  is  currently  classified  as  a  moderate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 41/308 
 
  
  
permeability,  although  at  the  time  of  the  study,  it  was  classified  as  being  low  passive  permeability. 
Poor mass balance was observed for GW642444 and results from the assay should be interpreted with 
caution. 
P-glycoprotein inhibition: 
A study was performed to assess the ability of GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) 
to  inhibit  human  P-gp  mediated  transport  of  3H-digoxin  using  stable  transfected  MDCKII-MDR1  cell.  
GW642444  inhibited  the  transport  of  digoxin  via  human  P-gp  in  vitro  by  26%  at  the  highest 
concentration tested (100 mcM). There was no evidence of inhibition at 30 mcM or below. As a result 
IC50 values could not be calculated but would be >100 mcM based on the data from this study. 
In vivo distribution studies: 
P-glycoprotein transport: 
In  a  pharmacokinetic  study  designed  to  provide  information  on  the  role  of  P-gp  in  attenuating  CNS 
penetration  and  oral  absorption  of  GW642444,  a  single  oral  dose  of  GW642444  (as  the 
triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) at a target dose level of 1000 mcg/kg was administered to 21 male 
mdr1a/1b (knockout, KO) and 21 male FVBn (wildtype, WT) mice.   
GW642444 exposures (based upon AUC0-t values) in hepatic portal vein (HPV) plasma were generally 
similar between KO and WT mice. Systemic concentrations of GW642444 and GSK932009 (M33) were 
higher in KO compared to WT mice (AUC0-t increases of 1.8- and 3-fold, respectively). In addition, the 
liver  exposure  to  GW642444  was  higher in  KO  mice  versus  WT  mice  (2.5-fold).  In  brain  homogenate 
there was at least a 7.4-fold increase in the AUC0-t value of GW642444 in KO mice compared to WT 
mice. In conclusion, P-gp attenuated the CNS penetration of GW642444, but did not appear to play a 
major role in limiting its absorption. The role of P-gp in the biliary elimination of GW642444 and/or its 
metabolites was thought unlikely to be of biological importance. 
Blood, plasma, liver and lung and GI tract concentration 
As  part  of  the  excretion  studies  performed  with  14C-  GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt, 
GW642444H-  350  mcg/kg)  via  i.v  or  oral  route  in  male  Sprague  Dawley  rats,  total  radioactivity  in 
blood, plasma, lungs and liver were determined for up to 96 hours post dose.  The mean blood:plasma 
concentration ratios of total DRM ranged from 0.8 to 1.1 following intravenous dosing and from 0.4 to 
0.7  following  oral  administration.  These  data  indicate  that  radioactivity  was  predominantly  associated 
with  the  plasma  fraction.  The  mean  liver:plasma  ratios  of  DRM  ranged  from  17  to  21  following 
intravenous dosing and from 3 to 11 following oral administration. Similarly, lung:plasma ratios ranged 
from 4 to 22 and 0.6 to 2 following intravenous and oral dosing, respectively. These data demonstrate 
a greater uptake of systemic DRM into the liver compared to lung. 
In  another  excretion  study,  the  concentrations  of  total  radioactivity  in  blood,  plasma  and  liver  were 
determined  at  a  single  sample  time  (48  hours  post  dose)  following  administration  of  a  single 
intravenous or oral dose of 14C-GW642444 (1000 mcg/kg, nominal) to male BDC Sprague Dawley rats 
(n=3/group).    Mean  blood:plasma  concentration  ratios  of  DRM  were  0.7  (intravenous)  and  0.9  (oral) 
corresponding to a blood cell association of 15% (intravenous) and 42% (oral), respectively. The mean 
liver:plasma  concentration  ratios  of  DRM  for  each  dosing  route  were  similar,  approximately  12 
(intravenous) and 8 (oral). 
Likewise, the concentration of total radioactivity in blood, plasma, lungs and liver was determined in an 
excretion  study  following  administration  of  a  single  intravenous  or  single  oral  dose  of  14C-GI179710 
(counter ion of GW642444M triphenylacetate salt) at 500 and 1000 mcg/kg, respectively, to groups of 
male  Sprague  Dawley  rats  (n=3/group).  The  mean  blood:plasma  concentration  ratios  of  DRM  ranged 
from  0.5  to  0.8  for  both  routes  of  administration.  These  data  indicate  that  DRM  was  predominantly 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 42/308 
 
  
  
associated with the plasma fraction. Similarly, mean liver:plasma and lung:plasma ratios ranged from 
6  to  27  and  0.5  to  0.9,  respectively.  These  data  demonstrate  uptake  of  systemic  DRM  into  the  liver 
was greater than for the lung. 
Whole body distribution 
Whole  body  distribution  was  examined  in  rats  and  dogs  following  iv  and  oral  administration  of  14C-
GW642444.   
Pigmented  (Lister  Hooded)  male  rats  (n=6/group)  received  a  single  intravenous  (over  30  seconds) 
administration  of  14C-GW642444  (as  the α-phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H)  at  a  nominal  dose  of 
350 mcg/kg. Following intravenous dosing, rats were killed (n=1) at 15 minutes, 6 hours, and 1, 3, 10 
and 35 days post dose, and QWBA performed. DRM was widely distributed into tissues at 15 minutes 
post  dose,  with  the  highest  observed  concentrations  for  the  vast  majority  of  tissues  occurring  at  this 
time.    The  vast  majority  of  tissues  contained  concentrations  greater  than  that  observed  in  blood. 
Highest concentrations of DRM at 15 minutes post dose were observed in the kidney, adrenals, choroid 
plexus  and  thyroid.  The  highest  observed  concentrations  for  some  tissues,  including  the  Harderian 
gland, brown and white fat, preputial gland, seminal vesicles and pancreas, did not occur until 6 hours 
after dosing. DRM was also distributed into melanin containing tissues such as the eye and pigmented 
skin. Distribution into the brain or CNS was low following intravenous administration. Concentrations of 
DRM  declined  from  the  earlier  time  points  and  at  35  days  only  the  uveal  tract/retina  and  testis 
contained quantifiable radioactivity.  
After Pigmented (Lister Hooded) male rats (n=6/group) received a single oral (gavage) administration 
of  14C-GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H)  at  a  nominal  dose  of  350  mcg/kg, 
only  a  limited  number  of  tissues  contained  quantifiable  concentrations  of  radioactivity  at  any  time 
point.  Those  that  did  included the  kidney  (cortex  and  medulla),  liver,  adrenal,  salivary  glands, brown 
fat,  lung,  uveal  tract  and  the  mucosae  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Other  than  the  gastrointestinal 
tract, no tissue contained quantifiable levels after 3 days. 
For  the  14C-GI179710  counter  ion  (500  mcg/kg),  DRM  was  widely  distributed  in  Pigmented  (Lister 
Hooded) male rats with the highest concentrations observed in the vast majority of tissues at the first 
sampling  time  (5  minutes)  following  iv  administration.  Highest  concentrations  were  observed  in  the 
liver,  tongue,  kidney  cortex,  myocardium,  pineal  body,  lung  and  bulbo-urethral  gland.  With  the 
exception  of  various  components  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  all  tissues  attained  their  highest 
observed  concentrations  of  DRM  at  5  minutes  after  dosing.  Tissue  concentrations  of  DRM  declined 
rapidly such that by 3 days post dose, concentrations in all tissues were generally below or close to the 
limit of quantification (0.003 mcg equivalents of GI179710/g). There was no evidence of association of 
DRM  with  melanin  containing  tissues,  with  no  tissue  containing  a  quantifiable  concentration  of 
radioactivity at 35 days post dose. 
Following  oral  dosing  (gavage)  of  the  14C-GI179710  counter  ion  (500  mcg/kg)  DRM  was  widely 
distributed, with highest concentrations of radioactivity observed in the vast majority of tissues at the 
first sampling time (30 minutes). The tissues containing the highest concentrations of DRM at this time 
(excluding components of the gastrointestinal tract) were the liver, kidney cortex, tooth pulp, pancreas 
and  tongue.  Tissue  concentrations  of  DRM  declined  rapidly  such  that  by  3  days  post  dose, 
concentrations  in  all  tissues  were  generally  below  or  close  to  the  limit  of  quantification  (0.003  mcg 
equivalents  of  GI179710/g).  There  was  no  evidence  of  association  of  DRM  with  melanin  containing 
tissues, with no tissue containing a quantifiable concentration of radioactivity at 35 days post dose.

Metabolism 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
In vitro 
In  vitro  studies  were  performed  using  hepatic  microsomes  (rat,  dog  and  human),  hepatocytes  (rat, 
mouse, rabbit, dog, and human) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) screen.  
In vitro clearance 
The in vitro intrinsic clearance of GSK573719 was determined in fresh, suspended rat, dog and human 
hepatocytes  (Report  CH2006/00011).  Intrinsic  clearance  was  similar  across  the  species.  GSK573719 
was  stable  over  the  incubation  period  in  rat  (0.84  mL/minute/g  liver),  dog  (1.80  mL/minute/g  liver) 
and human hepatocytes (1.08 mL/minute/g liver).  
The  in  vitro  intrinsic  clearance  of  GSK573719  was  also  determined  in  rat,  dog  and  human  liver 
microsomes  (Report  CH2006/00016).  The  in  vitro  clearance  of  GSK573719  was  higher  in  the  rat 
(15.582 mL/min/g liver) and dog (15.572 mL/min/g liver) than in human (2.142 mL/min/g liver). 
In vitro metabolism 
A study was performed to investigate the in vitro metabolism of  14C-GSK573719 (10 and 50 mcM) in 
human,  rat  and  dog  using  hepatocytes  (Report  WD2006/00147).  The  metabolism  of  GSK573719 
across species was compared using radio-HPLC and HPLC-MS analyses.  
The  results  suggest the  main  routes  of  metabolism  in  human  are  likely  to  be O-dealkylation  (20%  of 
the total metabolism via M14, GSK339067) and hydroxylation (23% of the total metabolism via M33, 
GSK1761002  and  M34,  which  co-eluted).  Other  routes  are  conjugation  with  glutathione  and 
methylation  and/or  glucuronidation  of  the  hydroxylated  metabolites.  The  major  routes  of  metabolism 
in  human  hepatocytes  were  also  present  in  either  or  both  rat,  with  metabolism  via  M14  and  minor 
amounts  of  M33  present,  and  in  dog  with  metabolism  via  M14  and  M33/M34.  All  of  the  metabolites 
identified in human hepatocytes were also present in either or both of the nonclinical species, with the 
exception  of  M45  (a  glutathione  conjugate)  and  M49  (a  sulphate  conjugate).  However,  there  were 
several minor unidentified components in some of the human hepatocyte preparations which appeared 
to  be  absent  from  rat  and  dog  hepatocytes.  The  extent  of  metabolism  of  GSK573719  in  human 
hepatocytes was variable ranging from 19 to 84% turnover (average 43%). The metabolic turnover of 
GSK573719 in rat and dog hepatocytes was lower at 26% and 28%, respectively.  
In  addition,  14C-GSK573719  (0.01,  0.1  and  1  mcM),  was  incubated  with  human  liver  microsomes  to 
determine  the  potential  for  metabolic  activation  in  the  absence  or  presence  of  a  NADPH  regenerating 
co-factor  solution.  Some  binding  of  drug-related  material  was  observed  in  human  liver  microsomes, 
which  was  predominantly  co-factor-dependent.  The  metabolic  activation  for  GSK573719  (114 
pmoles/mg  protein/hour)  was  similar  to  that  observed  for  acetaminophen  (122  pmoles/mg 
protein/hour). 
A further in  vitro study to compare the metabolism of  14C-GSK573719 (10 and 50 mcM) using radio-
HPLC  and  HPLC-MS  analysis  was  performed  in  human,  male  mouse  and  female  rabbit  hepatocytes 
(Report WD2007/01370). The metabolic turnover of GSK573719 was low (around 13%) in the human 
hepatocyte  preparation  used  in  this  study,  but  higher  (>84%)  in  rabbit  and  mouse  hepatocytes.  The 
main  routes  of  metabolism  of  GSK573719  in  human  hepatocytes  were  O-dealkylation  (M14), 
hydroxylation (M33) and methoxylation (M34 via M33). O-dealkylation and hydroxylation (as observed 
Assessment report

in  human)  were  major  pathways  in  the  mouse  but  minor  pathways  in  the  rabbit  (M64/M1  and  M37, 
respectively). Methoxylation (to M34 in human) was a minor pathway in rabbit (to M22, a glucuronide 
of  M34)  but  absent  in  the  mouse.  The  major  routes  of  metabolism  in  rabbit  hepatocytes  were 
hydroxylation  (M37)  followed  by  glucuronide  conjugation  (M27).  The  major  routes  of  metabolism  in 
mouse  hepatocytes  were  O-dealkylation  (M14),  hydroxylation  followed  by  glucuronide  conjugation 
(M21, M26, M27 and M29) and formation of a hydrated glutathione conjugate (M13 and M45). 
CYP450 metabolism 
A  preliminary  study  was  performed  to  provide  information  on  the  human  cytochrome  P450  enzymes 
involved  in  the  oxidative  metabolism  of  GSK573719  (0.075  mcM)  in  vitro  (Report  WD2006/03367). 
14C-GSK573719  was  incubated  with  human  liver  microsomes  and  with  microsomes  expressing  the 
individual cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP): CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A13, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 and 
3A5. Further incubations with human liver microsomes were performed in the presence and absence of 
selective  CYP450  inhibitors;  furafylline  (CYP1A2),  montelukast  (CYP2C8),  sulphaphenazole  (CYP2C9), 
benzylnirvanol  (CYP2C19),  quinidine  (CYP2D6)  and  azamulin  (CYP3A4).  The  quantifiable  in  vitro 
metabolism  of  GSK573719  in  human  liver  microsomes  is  mediated  primarily  by  CYP2D6,  with  some 
contribution  from  CYP3A4.  GSK573719  is  also  metabolised  by  the  CYP450  enzyme  CYP1A1,  which  is 
known  to  be  expressed  extrahepatically.  The  major  metabolite  routes  of  metabolism  observed  in 
human  liver  microsomes  were  O-dealkylation  to  M14  (GSK339067)  and  hydroxylation  to  M33 
(GSK1761002). There was further hydroxylation to yield low levels of M56 and M61.  
Metabolism studies in the isolated perfused liver 
A  study  was  performed  to  provide  data  on  the  major  metabolites  of  GSK573719  (10000  mcg/kg)  in 
male and female rat bile, perfusate and liver produced by an isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) (Report 
WD2005/01195).  Elimination  of  14C-GSK573719  in  the  isolated  perfused  rat  liver  was  by  both  direct 
biliary secretion of parent and metabolism, with 11% and 36% of the radioactivity being recovered in 
bile from the male and female rat liver, respectively. Metabolism in the isolated perfused rat liver was 
complex  with  33  metabolites  being  identified  and  many  metabolites  having  multiple  sites  of 
metabolism.  Routes  of  metabolism  included  oxidation  (M33,  M34,  M35,  M37,  M38,  M41)  and  O-
dealkylation  (M14  and  M18),  sometimes  combined  with  glucuronide  (M22,  M21,  M27,  M20,  M26), 
sulphate (M3, M4), methyl thiol conjugation (M11, M13) and hydration (M9). The metabolic profiles in 
liver  and  perfusate  supernatant  extracts  were  similar  to  those  in  bile.  There  were  no  notable 
differences in routes of metabolism between the male and female liver preparations. 
Cytochrome P450 inhibition by GSK573719 
A  study  was  performed  to  determine  the  in  vitro  concentration-dependent  inhibition  of  human 
cytochrome  P450  enzymes  by  GSK573719  (concentration  range  0.03  to  33  mcM)  (Report 
CH2005/00950).  GSK573719  was  demonstrated  to  be  an  inhibitor  of  CYP2D6  (IC50  =  0.1  mcM)  and 
CYP3A4  (IC50  =  0.1  mcM  using  diethoxyfluorescein  and  8.0  mcM  using  7-benzoquinoline  as  probe 
substrates). GSK573719 did not demonstrate inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. 
In Vivo Studies 
Mouse:  
Following  a  single  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GSK573719  in  male  CD-1  mice  (n=18)  (Report 
2010N105743)  the  major  route  of  elimination  was  excretion  of  GSK573719  and  metabolites  in  the 
faeces  and  urine  (49%  and  8%  of  the  administered  dose,  respectively).  GSK573719  was  excreted 
unchanged (34% of dose) or via metabolism (21% of the dose). The major circulating component was 
parent GSK573719, accounting for 24% and 48% of the radioactivity in the 15 and 60 minutes plasma 
sample  extracts,  respectively.  A  hydroxylated  glucuronide  (M21),  a  methoxy,  hydroxy  O-glucuronide 
(M22) and a hydrated glutathione conjugate (M13) being the major circulating metabolites, with M21

and  M22  accounting  for  20%  of  the  radioactivity  in  the  15  and  60  minutes  plasma  sample  extracts, 
respectively. These same metabolites were observed in extract of liver homogenate. 
The  major  routes  of  metabolism,  as  observed  by  metabolites  in  excreta,  in  the  mouse  were 
hydroxylation  (8%  of  the  dose  to  M33),  methylation  (4%  of  the  dose  to  M34)  and  conjugation  with 
glucuronic acid (M21/M22). Numerous minor metabolites accounted for the remaining 10% of excreted 
dose.  These  included  products  of  hydroxylation,  methylation,  O-dealkylation  and  conjugation  with 
glucuronide  (M27,  M44,  M67,  M69  and  M70),  glutathione  (M13)  and  cysteine (M53)  conjugation,  and 
combinations thereof. GSK573719 was the major component in liver homogenate, urine and faeces. 
Rat: 
Following  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GSK573719  to  intact  Sprague-Dawley  rats  (3/group) 
(Report  FD2005/00208),  the  main  route  of  elimination  of  GSK573719  was  primarily  by  secretion  of 
parent into the faeces (53% of the dose) and direct renal secretion (14% of the dose). Metabolism was 
a minor route of elimination, accounting for 4.4% dose with the major routes of metabolism being O-
dealkylation (2.5% of the dose to M14) and hydroxylation (1.9% of the dose to M33, M34 and M37). 
The  major  DRM  in  rat  plasma,  lung  and  liver  extracts  was  GSK573719.  The  only  other  notable 
radiolabelled  component  observed  in  liver  samples  collected  at  0.5  and  2  hours  post  dosing  was  a 
hydroxylated  metabolite  (M37)  which  accounted  for  approximately  4%  and  9%  of  the  sample 
radioactivity, respectively. 
Following  oral  administration  of  14C-GSK573719  to  intact  Sprague-Dawley  rats  (3/group)  (Report 
FD2005/00208)  approximately  95%  and  87%  of  the  administered  dose  was  accounted  as  unchanged 
GSK573719  in  the  0  to  24  hours  faeces  pool  in  intact  and  BDC  rats,  respectively.  This  material 
probably  reflected,  at  least  in  part,  unabsorbed  parent  compound.  The  only  detected,  but  non-
quantifiable,  metabolite  following  oral  administration  was  M14  in  the  faeces.  There  was  insufficient 
radioactivity  in  lung,  liver  and  plasma  samples  obtained  following  oral  dosing  to  allow  analysis.  The 
metabolites  present  in  bile  were  not  investigated  as  the  absorption  of  GSK573719  following  oral 
administration was established to be very low. 
Dog: 
Following  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GSK573719  to  Beagle  dogs  (3/M/group),  elimination  of 
GSK573719 was both by metabolism and as unchanged drug (a total of 14% of the dose in urine and 
faeces) with metabolites secreted in urine (approximately 6% of the dose) and faeces (approximately 
29%  of  the  dose).  The  major  routes  of  metabolism  were  O-dealkylation  (15.3%  of  the  dose  to  M14) 
and oxidation (9% of the dose to M33 and M37). Other notable metabolites were dihydrodiol (4.4% via 
M51)  and  methyl  catechol  (2.8%  of  the  dose  to  M34).  Additional  metabolites,  detectable  using  mass 
spectrometry,  but  not  quantifiable,  were  M57,  M56  and  M58.  Unchanged  GSK573719  was  the  major 
component in plasma samples at 1 and 3 hours after dosing, M14, M33, M34 and M51 being present, 
but non-quantifiable.  
In another study, 14C-GSK573719 as the trifluoroacetate salt (10 mcg/kg (slow bolus), 200 mcg/kg (60 
minutes  infusion)  and  200  mcg/kg  (10  minutes  infusion))  was  administered  to  BDC  beagle  dogs 
(2/M/group). GSK573719 was eliminated in both the urine (14% of dose) and the bile (56% of dose) 
with unchanged drug representing between 6 to 8% of the dose excreted in urine and bile. Metabolites 
were secreted in both the urine and bile with the major routes of metabolism being O-dealkylation and 
hydroxylation.  Other  pathways  included  formation  of  dihydrodiols  or  O-methylated  catechol  products 
and hydrated glycyl cysteine conjugates. Qualitatively the metabolite profiles in bile, urine and plasma 
did not significantly change with dose level or infusion time. The only quantifiable DRM component in 
plasma  was  GSK573719  with  concentrations  being  highest  following  intravenous  infusion  at  200 
mcg/kg over 10 minutes. 
Assessment report

In a further study, following oral administration of 14C-GSK573719 (1000 mcg/kg) to dogs (3/M/group) 
(Report  FD2005/00164),  elimination  of  radioactive  DRM  was  predominantly  via  faeces  accounting  for 
95% of the dose with approximately 78% of the administered dose being accounted for as unchanged 
GSK573719.  This  probably  reflected,  at  least  in  part,  unabsorbed  parent  compound.  The  only 
metabolite identified was the O-dealkylation product (M14) which accounted for 3.1% of the recovered 
dose in the 0 to 48 hour faeces pool. 
Human 
Following  repeated-inhalation  dosing  of  GSK573719  (1000  mcg)  to  healthy  subjects  (n=8)  and  in  a 
healthy population of CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (n=6) for 7 days (Report WD2009/00030) unchanged 
GSK573719  and  GSK339067  (M14,  an  O-dealkylated  metabolite)  were  the  only  GSK573719-related 
components detected in human plasma extracts and urine. There was evidence for a 2-fold decrease in 
the  proportion  of  GSK339067  relative  to  GSK573719  in  plasma  from  CYP2D6  poor  metabolisers 
compared  to  healthy  normal  metabolisers.  There  was  no  evidence  for  a  change  in  the  proportion  of 
GSK339067  to  GSK573719  in  urine  collected  from  CYP2D6  poor  metabolisers  compared  to  healthy 
normal metabolisers. It is possible that other metabolites may have been present in plasma but were 
not detected under the conditions used. 
In another study, a single intravenous or oral administration of 14C-GSK573719 (65 mcg or 1000 mcg) 
was  administered  to  6  healthy  male  subjects  (Report  2011N128400).  Following  intravenous 
administration  elimination  of  GSK573719  was  through  a  combination  of  direct  elimination  of  parent 
and by metabolism followed by excretion in faeces, or to a lesser extent, urine. Following oral dosing, 
very  little  DRM  was  observed  in  the  plasma  or  urine,  with  the  vast  majority  in  the  faeces  being 
unchanged  GSK573719,  indicating  low  oral  absorption.  The  main  routes  of  metabolism  across  the 
matrices studied were O-dealkylation (M14) and hydroxylation (M33). 
The  major  circulating  component  in  plasma  samples  following  intravenous  administration  was 
unchanged  GSK573719.  The  circulating  metabolites  observed  were  identified  as  from  O-dealkylated 
(M14)  and  hydroxylation  (M33)  routes.  A  third  component  in  plasma  was  tentatively  assigned  by 
chromatographic  retention  time  as  a  hydroxylated  metabolite  (M61).  Elimination  of  unchanged 
GSK573719  was  the  major  route  observed  in  humans  dosed  intravenously  and  was  the  major 
component seen in the bile, faeces and urine. Other metabolites observed were M14, M33 with other 
metabolites not being unassigned structures. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
In vitro studies: 
In vitro studies were performed using hepatic and lung microsomes, hepatocytes and cytochrome P450 
(CYP) screen. In microsomes from rats, dogs and humans, and lung microsomes from humans the in 
vitro  clearance  of  GW642444  was  high  in  rat  (19  to  31  mL/min/g liver)  and human  liver  microsomes 
(30 to 49 mL/min/g liver) and moderate in dog liver microsomes (8 mL/min/g liver). Characterisation 
of  human  microsomal  drug-related  products  by  HPLC-MS  indicated  that  the  most  abundant  human 
microsomal metabolite was GW630200 (subsequently referred to as M29). GW642444 was stable when 
incubated  with  human  lung  microsomes.    Similarly,  intrinsic  clearance  of  GW642444  (as  the 
triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  by  human  liver  microsomes  was  rapid,  with  a  mean  calculated 
intrinsic  clearance  value  of  111  mL/min/g  liver.  Intrinsic  clearance  of  GW642444  in  human  intestinal 
microsomes was approximately 4.5-fold lower than observed for liver microsomes, and GW642444 was 
metabolically stable using human lung microsomes. 
Metabolism of 14C-GW642444 by human liver microsomes and microsomes expressing individual CYP 
isoenzymes,  showed  that  turnover  of  14C-GW642444  was  high  (48%)  in  human  liver  microsomes 
producing  4  major  metabolites;  M29  (GW630200)  and  M31  formed  following  O-dealkylation,  M20 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 47/308 
 
  
  
formed  following  N-dealkylation  and  M40  resulting  from  amine  hydrolysis.  Other  minor  metabolites, 
M47,  M26,  M16  and  M32,  were  also  detected  by  LC/MSn  only.  The  production  of  M29  (GW630200), 
M31 and M20 was predominantly mediated by CYP3A4 with minor contributions from CYP2D6. M40 was 
thought likely to be a further metabolite of M20 which is not mediated by cytochrome P450 but may be 
due  to  amine  oxidase.  In  human  liver  microsomes  the  predominant  route  of  metabolism  was  O-
dealkylation  to  M29  (GW630200).  The  in  vitro  metabolism  of  GW642444  was  primarily  mediated  by 
CYP3A4 with minor contributions by CYP2D6.   
The in vitro turnover of GW642444 in human hepatocytes in 2 hours was 95% (1 mcM) and 81% (12.5 
mcM). At a concentration of 1 mcM the intrinsic clearance of GW642444 was 0.021 mL/min/106 cells 
(~2.5 mL/min/g liver). The major metabolite of GW642444 in human liver hepatocytes was identified 
as a carboxylic acid derivative of GW630200 (M29) - subsequently referred to as GSK932009 or M33. 
The  extent  of  metabolism  in  human  liver  hepatocytes  varied  between  the  different  preparations  and 
ranged  between  42 to  64%  turnover  at 4  hours.  The  major  route  of  metabolism  in each  human  liver 
hepatocyte  sample  studied  was  O-dealkylation  to  M33  (GSK932009)  and  M29  (GW630200)  which 
represented  means  of  approximately  12  and  24%  of  the  total  metabolism,  respectively.  These 
metabolites  were  also  detected  in  rat  and  dog.    Other  minor  metabolites  were  detected  which 
represented approximately 7% or less of the total metabolism and were generally, also, the result of 
dealkylation  metabolism.  The  major  metabolite  identified  in  rat  liver  hepatocytes  was  M12,  an  O-
glucuronide conjugate, which represented approximately 40% of the metabolites assigned. The major 
metabolite  identified  in  dog  liver  hepatocytes  was  M26  (C-dealkylation  or  oxidative  loss  of  the  salicyl 
alcohol)  which  represented  approximately  43%  of  the  metabolites  assigned.  Numerous  other 
metabolites were identified in the rat and dog which included a range of O-dealkylated metabolites. 
The  main  route  of  metabolism  of  GI179710  in  human  hepatocytes  was  acyl  glucuronidation, 
representing  approximately  95%  of  the  total  metabolism.  Other  metabolites  resulted  from  para-
hydroxylation/acyl  glucuronidation  and  acyl  glucose  conjugation  which  represented  5%  or  less  of  the 
total  metabolism.  Acyl  glucuronidation  was  prevalent  in  all  non-clinical  species  (mouse,  rat,  female 
rabbit  and  dog)  investigated  (78  to  94%  of  the  total  metabolism).  In  general,  metabolic  profiles  in 
non-clinical  and  human  hepatocytes  were  qualitatively  similar.  The  extent  of  metabolism  of  14C-
GI179710 was high in all species investigated. 
A  study  was  performed  to  assess  the  potential  for  chiral  conversion  of  GW642444  (R-enantiomer)  to 
GSK907117 (S-enantiomer) in control human plasma and in rat and dog ex-vivo plasma obtained from 
separate  studies.  Using  chiral  HPLC  separation  with  MS  detection  to  detect  interconversion  of 
GW642444 and its enantiomer GSK907117, no evidence of chiral conversion (>10%) of GW642444 to 
GSK907117 in plasma obtained following inhaled administration of GW642444M to the rat or dog or in 
incubations of GW642444 in control human plasma was observed. 
Finally, in a cytochrome P450 inhibition screen, the mean IC50 values for GW642444 were >100, >23, 
>70  and  12  mcM  for  CYP450  1A2,  2C9,  2C19  and  2D6,  respectively.  The  inhibition  potential  of 
GW642444 for CYP3A4 was determined against two CYP3A4 substrates: diethoxyfluorescein (DEF) and 
7- benzoquinoline (7BQ). The mean IC50 values were 4.2 and 11 mcM, respectively. 
In vivo studies: 
Following  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GW642444  (α-phenylcinnamate  salt)  at  350  mcg/kg  in 
male  Sprague  Dawley  rats,  the  main  routes  of  elimination  of  DRM  were  via  the  faeces  (69%  of  the 
administered dose) and urine (19% of the administered dose). Elimination was largely by metabolism 
with the main routes being dealkylation (13% dose via M7, M26, M1, M3/30, M9), oxidation (22% dose 
via M34, M7, M30, M1, M9) and glucuronide conjugation (5% dose via M1, M3). A further 13% of the 
administered  dose  was  excreted  as  unchanged  GW642444  in  the  faeces  potentially  resulting  from 
either  direct  secretion  of  GW642444  or  hydrolysis  of  the  corresponding  glucuronide.  The  principal

radiolabelled components observed in plasma following intravenous dosing were unchanged parent and 
an unidentified component.  Similarly, in male BDC Sprague Dawley rat using single intravenous (500 
mcg/kg) doses of 14C-GW642444, the main routes of elimination of DRM were via the bile (45% of the 
dose) and urine (32% of the dose). Metabolite quantification in both urine and bile was difficult due to 
the  complexity  of  the  profiles  and  the  low  concentration  of  radioactivity  in  the  samples.  The  main 
metabolites  were  by  glucuronidation  (to  M12  representing  8%  of  the  dose  in  bile)  and  by  O-
dealkylation/oxidation  (to  M7,  M9  and  M30  representing  5,  5  and  3%  of  the  dose,  respectively,  in 
urine).  Faecal  elimination  was  a  minor  route  (6%  of  the  dose)  and  contained  mainly  unchanged 
GW642444 (4% of the dose), possibly resulting from direct gut secretion.   
Following intravenous administration of 14C-GI179710 to rats, the principal radiolabelled components 
in  plasma,  liver  and  lung  samples  at  the  selected  time  points  were  unchanged  GI179710  and  M18. 
GI179710  represented  35  to  65%  plasma  radioactivity  whilst  M18  represented  16  to  28%  of  plasma 
radioactivity. 
Following  oral  administration  of  14C-GW642444  (α-phenylcinnamate  salt)  at  350  mcg/kg  in  male 
Sprague  Dawley  rats,  elimination  was  was  largely  via  faeces  (86%  of  the  administered  dose)  which 
mainly constituted unchanged parent (at least 77% of the administered dose). Unchanged GW642444 
in  rat  faeces  is  potentially  due  to  incomplete  absorption,  hydrolysis  of  one  or  more  glucuronide 
conjugates  or  direct  GI  secretion.  Rat  urine  contained  a  further  4.7%  of  the  dose  which  was  almost 
exclusively  made  up  of  metabolites  with  unchanged  GW642444  being  unquantifiable.  Consistent  with 
intravenous administration, the main urinary metabolites resulted from dealkylation (M7, M26, M1, M3, 
M30, M9), oxidation (M7, M26, M30, M9) or glucuronide conjugation (M1, M3). No metabolites could be 
detected  by  LC-MSn  where  the  14C-label  of  GW642444  was  lost  due  to  O-dealkylation.  Plasma 
obtained following oral administration was not analysed due to insufficient radioactivity. Furthermore, 
in  male  BDC  Sprague  Dawley  rat  using  single  oral  (1000  mcg/kg)  doses  of  14C-GW642444,  faecal, 
biliary  and  urinary  excretion  accounted  for  54.6,  28.3  and  8.8%  of  the  dose,  respectively.  Faecal 
radioactivity  contained  predominantly  unchanged  GW642444  (49%  administered  dose)  which  is  most 
likely  unabsorbed  drug  although  a  proportion  may  be  a  result  from  direct  gut  secretion.  The  main 
routes  of  metabolism  of  GW642444  in  the  BDC  rat  following  oral  dosing  were  by  glucuronidation  (to 
M12  which  represented  25%  of  the  dose  in  bile)  or  by  O-dealkylation,  oxidation  and  O-glucuronide 
conjugation (to M1 which represented 4.5% of the dose in urine). 
Following  oral  administration  of  14C-GI179710  to  rats,  the  principal  radiolabelled  components  in 
plasma,  liver  and  lung  samples  at  the  selected  time  points  were  unchanged  GI179710  (33  to  55% 
plasma radioactivity) and the acyl glucuronide (17 to 32% of plasma radioactivity). 
Major  metabolites  were  also  examined  in  male  beagle  dogs  dosed  with  a  single  intravenous  or  single 
oral  doses  of  14C-GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H)  at  50  and  100  mcg/kg, 
respectively.  Following  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt, 
GW642444H)  to  the  dog,  elimination  of  DRM  was  via  both  the  faeces  and  urine  (48  and  39%  of  the 
administered  dose,  respectively).  Elimination  was  almost  completely  by  metabolism  with  the  main 
routes being dealkylation (30% dose via M30, M7, M33 and M9) and oxidation (45% dose via M30, M7, 
M16  and  M9).  The  proportion  of  dose  excreted  as  unchanged  GW642444  was  negligible.  No 
metabolites could be detected by HPLC-MS where the 14C-label had been lost. Unchanged GW642444 
was the only major component observed in dog plasma following intravenous dosing. A high proportion 
of  DRM  in  dog  plasma  and  faeces  was  unextractable.    Elimination  of  14C-GW642444  DRM  following 
oral administration was via both faeces and urine (56 and 22% of the administered dose, respectively). 
Unchanged GW642444 represented only 16% of the administered dose in dog faeces and is probably a 
reflection  of  either  moderate  or  good  absorption  of  the  14C-GW642444  α-phenylcinnamate  salt.  The 
main  routes  of  metabolism  in  the  dog  (as  for  intravenous  administration)  were  via  dealkylation  (to 
M30, M7, M33, M9 and M26) and oxidation (to M30, M7, M16), representing a combined 23% and 19%

of  the  administered  dose,  respectively.  Two  principal  radiolabelled  components  were  detected  in  dog 
plasma  (1  hour  post  dose)  and  were  identified  as  unchanged  GW642444  (44%  plasma  radioactivity) 
and  M26  (a  metabolite  resulting  from  C-dealkylation  and  representing  30%  plasma  radioactivity).  A 
large proportion of DRM in dog plasma was unextractable. 
Following  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GI179710  (500  mcg/kg)  to  the  dog,  elimination  of  DRM 
was  mainly  via  faeces  (88%  administered  dose)  but  also  via  urine  (11%  administered  dose). 
Elimination was largely by excretion of unchanged GI179710 (73% administered dose), of which 72% 
and  1%  administered  dose  was  in  the  faeces  and  urine,  respectively.  Unchanged  GI179710  in  faecal 
extracts may have (at least in part) resulted from hydrolysis of the corresponding acyl glucuronides. A 
further 13% of the administered dose was eliminated via acyl glucuronidation (comprising 9% dose in 
urine and 4% in faeces). The principal radiolabelled components in the plasma samples at the selected 
time points were unchanged GI179710 (16 to 70% plasma radioactivity) and the acyl glucuronides (17 
to  57%).  An  acyl  glucose  conjugate  represented  3  to  17%  plasma  radioactivity.  Following  oral 
administration of 14C-GI179710 (1000 mcg/kg) to the dog (Report FD2005/00186/00), elimination of 
radioactive  DRM  in  the  dog  was  predominantly  via  the  faeces  (76%  dose)  with  urine  representing 
approximately  17%  of  dose.  Unchanged  GI179710  was  the  largest  component  in  dog  faeces 
representing  57%  of  the  administered  dose  which  may  have  resulted  from  either  incomplete 
absorption or hydrolysis of the corresponding acyl glucuronides. The similarity between the elimination 
data  in  urine  and  faeces  from  dogs  dosed  orally  and  intravenously,  however,  would  tend  to  indicate 
that  oral  absorption  was  good.  Approximately  15%  of  the  administered  dose  was  eliminated  via  acyl 
glucuronidation  (comprising  12%  and  3%  dose  in  urine  and  faeces,  respectively).  The  principal 
radiolabelled  components  in  plasma  samples  at  the  selected  time  points  were  unchanged  GI179710 
(25  to  52%  plasma  radioactivity)  and  acyl  glucuronides  (38  to  52%).  An  acyl  glucose  conjugate 
represented 6 to 10% plasma radioactivity. 
In humans, information on metabolism was obtained from human plasma on Day 7 following repeated 
inhalation  dosing  of  GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H)  at  200  mcg/kg  to 
asthmatic  subjects.  GW642444  was  detected  in  all  the  samples  analysed.  M33  (GSK932009,  O-
dealkylation  with  oxidation)  was  detected  in  pooled  0  to  12  hour  plasma  and  in  individual  plasma 
samples taken at 1 hour post dose from all 9 subjects. M29 (GW630200, O-dealkylation) was detected 
in  the  plasma  of  one  out  of  nine  subjects  taken  at  1  hour  post  dose.  It  is  possible  that  other 
metabolites may have been present in plasma but were not detected under the conditions used.  
Metabolism  of  GW642444  was  also  studied  in  six  healthy  male  volunteers  following  a  single  oral 
administration  of  14C-GW642444  (200  mcg).  Elimination  of  GW642444  was  mainly  by  metabolism 
followed  by  excretion  of  metabolites  in  urine,  or  to  a  lesser  extent,  faeces.  The  main  routes  of 
metabolism were assigned as various O-dealkylation pathways which accounted for up to 78% of the 
recovered  radioactive  dose  (combined  for  urine  and  faeces).  Metabolism  via  C-  or  N-dealkylation 
accounted  for  a  further  5%  of  the  recovered  radioactive  dose.  Unchanged  GW642444  was  a  small 
component in faeces (5% of the recovered radioactive dose), representing either unabsorbed material 
or  unchanged  GW642444  (or  conjugate)  secreted  directly  into  the  GI  tract  or  via  human  bile.  The 
residual 12% of the recovered radioactive dose constituted a mixture of small unassigned components. 
Human circulating plasma metabolites were also mainly the products of O- or C-dealkylation. 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
No  metabolism  PK  studies  were  performed  on  the

Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
Mouse 
Following  a  single  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GSK573719  to  CD-1  mice  (18/M/group)  (Report 
2010N105743) the total recovery was 91%, of which 49% was recovered in the faeces with a further 
8% recovered in the urine. Approximately 28% of the dose was recovered in carcass digests, indicating 
that elimination of DRM was incomplete within the 24 hour period post dose. No cage washings were 
performed in this study and this may have affected the total amount of radioactivity recovered. There 
was a notable decrease in the levels of radioactivity between 15 minutes and 24 hours in the plasma 
and liver, with decreases of approximately 150-fold and 55-fold, respectively. 
Rat 
Following  a  single  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GSK573719  to  intact  and  BDC  rats  (3/group) 
(Report FD2005/00208), radioactivity was predominantly excreted in the faeces (mean of 65.3% of the 
dose)  with  urinary  elimination  accounting  for  a  mean  of  16.9%  of  the  dose.  The  elimination  of 
radioactivity  was  initially  relatively  rapid  with  a  mean  of  78.8%  of  the  dose  being  recovered  by  48 
hours  post  dose.  However,  the  remainder  of  the  dose  was  excreted  relatively  slowly  and  the  overall 
elimination was incomplete by 96 hours post dose, with a mean of 11.0% of the dose remaining in the 
carcass (mean of 10.1% of the dose) and tissues (mean of 0.9% of the dose). The mean total recovery 
of radioactivity was 93.9% of the dose. 
Following  a  single  oral  administration  of  14C-GSK573719  to  intact  and  BDC  rats  (3/group)  (Report 
FD2005/00208)  the  major  route  of  elimination  was  via  the  faeces  (mean  of  96.4%  of  the  dose)  and 
urinary  elimination  was  minimal  (mean  of  0.1%  of  the  dose).  In  BDC  rats,  the  major  route  of 
elimination  was  via  the  faeces  (mean  of  92.9%  of  the  dose).  Urinary  and  biliary  elimination  were 
minor,  accounting  for  on  average  no  more  than  0.2%  of  the  dose.  The  mean  total  recovery  of 
radioactivity  in  intact  and  BDC  rats  was  96.5%  and  93.8%  of  the  dose,  respectively.  Elimination  of 
DRM was rapid in both intact and BDC rats with greater than 90% of the dose recovered by 24 hours 
post dose. Absorption of DRM was negligible based on the radioactivity in urine, bile and the residual 
carcass. 
Dog 
Following a single oral administration of 14C-GSK573719 to beagle dogs (2M) (Report FD2005/00164), 
the  major  route  of  elimination  of  radioactivity  was  via  the  faeces  (mean  of  95.1%  of  the  dose)  with 
urinary  excretion  being  minor  (mean  of  0.4%  of  the  dose).  Absorption  of  DRM,  as  judged  by 
radioactivity in the urine, appeared to be minimal. The mean total recovery of radioactivity (including 
cage  washes)  was  96.5%  of  the  dose.  Elimination  of  radioactivity  was  rapid  with  the  majority  of  the 
administered dose recovered within 48 hours post dose. 
Following  a  single  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GSK573719  to  beagle  dogs  (3M)  (Report 
FD2005/00164), the major route of elimination of radioactivity was via the faeces (mean of 61.8% of 
the  dose)  with  urinary  excretion  accounting  for  a  mean  of  11.9%  of  the  dose.  The  elimination  was 
protracted  with  approximately  1%  of  the  dose  being  eliminated  during  each  of  the  24  hour  periods 
between  96  and  168  hours  post dose.  This  protracted  elimination  probably  accounts  for  the  low  total 
recovery of radioactivity (74.5% of the dose). 
In  another  study,  administration  of  a  single  intravenous  dose  of  14C-GSK573719  (as  the 
trifluoroacetate salt at 10 mcg/kg (slow bolus) or 200 mcg/kg (10 minute and 60 minute infusion)) to 
BDC  beagle  dogs  (2/M/goup)  (Report  WD2007/01907)  the  major  route  of  elimination  of  radioactivity 
was  via  bile  (mean  of  57%  of  the  dose),  with  majority  of  the  elimination  occurring  within  the  first  8 
hours  post  dose  for  all  3  dosing  regimens.  The  urinary  elimination  accounted  for  a  mean  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 51/308 
 
  
  
approximately  14%  of  the  dose  and  excretion  in  faeces  was  a  minor  elimination  pathway  accounting 
for  no  more  than  4%  of  the  dose.  Total  recoveries  of  radioactivity  (including  cage  washes)  ranged 
between  means  of  70%  and  74%  of  the  dose.  The  low  recoveries  were  probably  due  to  the  short 
collection period (0 to 48 hours) as there was evidence that elimination was still occurring at 48 hours. 
Overall, the elimination of the majority of the dose was rapid, with between 58% and 66% recovered 
in the urine, faeces, bile and cage washes by 24 hours post dose. For all 3 dosing regimens, the rate of 
bile  production  decreased following dosing,  followed generally  by  a  recovery  within  1  to  3  hours  post 
dose, and thereafter remained relatively constant over the remaining period up to 48 hours post dose. 
Over  the  entire  48  hours  study  period,  the  overall  bile  production  was  generally  similar  for  all  3 
regimens.  The  highest  mean  concentration  of  radioactivity  in  the  bile  generally  occurred  within  60 
minutes of completion of dose administration, and declined thereafter. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Rat: 
Following a single oral 14C-GW642444 (as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H) (350 mcg/kg) in 
male Sprague Dawley rats, the major route of elimination observed was via the faeces (mean of 86.1% 
of  the  dose),  with  urinary  elimination  accounting  for  a  mean  of  4.7%  of  the  dose.  Elimination  of 
radioactivity was rapid with a mean of approximately 86% of the dose being eliminated during 0 to 24 
hours post dose. A mean total of 0.2% of the dose was present in the gastrointestinal tracts, residual 
carcasses and livers at 96 hours. At least 5% of the dose was absorbed as judged by DRM in the urine 
and  residual  carcass  following  oral  administration.  A  comparison  of  radioactivity  eliminated  in  urine 
following  oral  (4.7%)  and  intravenous  (18.6%)  administrations  would  indicate  that  absorption  was 
probably  as  high  as  approximately  25%.  The  mean  total  recovery  of  radioactivity  (including  cage 
washes) was 91.8% of the dose. 
Following a single intravenous dosing in the same study (350 mcg/kg slow bolus over 30 minutes), the 
major  route  of  elimination  of  radioactive  DRM  was  via  the  faeces  (mean  of  69.2%  of  the  dose),  with 
urinary  elimination  accounting  for  a  mean  18.6%  of  the  dose  (see  table  below).  Elimination  of 
radioactivity was fairly rapid with a mean of approximately 73% of the dose eliminated in the urine and 
faeces during 0 to 24 hours post dose. A mean total of approximately 2% of the dose was present in 
the  gastrointestinal  tracts,  residual  carcasses  and  livers  at  96  hours.  The  mean  total  recovery  of 
radioactivity (including cage washes) was 93.3% of the dose. 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  14C-GI179710  (triphenylacteic  acid,  the  counter  ion  of  GW642444M 
triphenylacetate  salt)  (1000  mcg/kg)  to  male  Sprague  Dawley  rats,  the  major  route  of  elimination  of 
the  radioactive  DRM,  the  major  route  of  elimination  of  DRM  was  via  the  faeces  (mean  84.4%  of  the 
dose).  Urinary  elimination  accounted  for  a  mean  3.6%  of  the  dose.  Elimination  of  radioactivity  was 
relatively rapid, with a mean of 85% of the dose being recovered in the urine, faeces and cage washes 
by  48  hours  post  dose.  At  least  4%  of  the  dose  was  absorbed  as  judged  by  DRM  in  the  urine  and 
residual  carcass  and  tissues  following  oral  administration.  A  comparison  of  radioactivity  eliminated  in 
urine  following  oral  (3.6%)  and  intravenous  (4.2%)  administrations  would  indicate  that  actual 
absorption  was  probably  higher  than  this.  The  mean  total  recovery  of  radioactivity  (including  cage 
washes) was 88.7% of the dose. 
Following a single intravenous dosing in the same study (500 mcg/kg slow bolus over 30 minutes), the 
major route of elimination of DRM was via the faeces (mean of 84.8% of the dose). Urinary elimination 
accounted  for  a  mean  of  4.2%  of  the  dose.  Elimination  of  radioactivity  was  relatively  rapid,  with  at 
least 87% of the dose being recovered in the urine, faeces and cage washes by 48 hours post dose. A 
mean  total  of  0.4%  of  the  dose  was  recovered  in  the  liver,  lungs,  gastrointestinal  tract  and  residual 
carcass. The mean total recovery of radioactivity (including cage washes) was 90% of the dose.

To  gain  information  on  the  extent  of  biliary  excretion  and  metabolism  of  GW642444,  male  BDC 
Sprague  Dawley  rats  were  given  a  single  intravenous  or  oral  dose  of  14C-GW642444  (parent  form) 
(500  mcg/kg).  The  major  routes  of  elimination  of  DRM  following  intravenous  administration  were  via 
the bile and urine (means of 45% and 32% of the dose, respectively). Approximately 6% of the dose 
was recovered in the faeces. Mean total recovery (including cage washings, livers and carcasses) was 
94% at 48 hours post dose. The major routes of elimination of DRM following oral administration were 
also  via  the  faeces  and  bile  (means  of  55%  and  28%  of  the  dose,  respectively),  a  further  9%  was 
eliminated  via  the  urine.  A  mean  of  at  least  37%  of  the  dose  was  orally  absorbed,  as  judged  by  the 
amounts of DRM in bile and urine. Mean total recovery (including cage washings, livers and carcasses) 
was 95% at 48 hours post dose. Elimination of radioactivity was rapid following both intravenous and 
oral administration, with the majority of the dose being recovered by 24 hours post dose. 
Dog: 
Following  a  single  oral  14C-GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H)  to  male  beagle 
dogs, the major route of elimination observed via the faeces (a mean of 56% of the dose), with urinary 
excretion  accounting  for  a  mean  of  22% of  the dose.  Initial elimination  of  radioactivity  was  relatively 
rapid,  with  a  mean  of  approximately  70%  of  the  dose  eliminated  in  the  urine  and  faeces  during  the 
period of 0 to 24 hours post dose. At least approximately 22% of the dose was absorbed as judged by 
DRM  in  the  urine  following  oral  administration.  A  comparison  of  radioactivity  eliminated  in  urine 
following  oral  (22%  dose)  and  intravenous  (39%  dose)  administration  would  indicate  that  absorption 
was probably as high as approximately 56%. The mean total recovery of radioactivity (including cage 
washes)  was  79%  of  the  dose.  Following  a  single  intravenous  dosing  in  the  same  study,  the  major 
route  of  elimination  observed  was  again  via  the  faeces  (a  mean  of  47.9%  of  the  dose),  with  urinary 
excretion accounting for a mean of 38.8% of the dose. Elimination of radioactivity was relatively rapid 
with a mean of approximately 70% of the dose eliminated in the urine and faeces during the period 0 
to 24 hours post dose. The mean total recovery of radioactivity (including cage washes) was 88.8% of 
the dose. 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  14C-GI179710  (triphenylacteic  acid,  the  counter  ion  of  GW642444M 
triphenylacetate salt) (1000 mcg/kg), the major route of elimination of radioactivity was via the faeces 
(a mean of 56% of the dose), with urinary excretion accounting for a mean of 22% of the dose. Initial 
elimination  of  radioactivity  was  relatively  rapid,  with  a  mean  of  approximately  70%  of  the  dose 
eliminated in the urine and faeces during the period of 0 to 24 hours post dose. At least approximately 
22%  of  the  dose  was  absorbed  as  judged  by  DRM  in  the  urine  following  oral  administration.  A 
comparison of radioactivity eliminated in urine following oral (22% dose) and intravenous (39% dose) 
administration would indicate that absorption was probably as high as approximately 56%. The mean 
total  recovery  of  radioactivity  (including  cage  washes)  was  79%  of  the  dose.    When  dosed 
intravenously  (500  mcg/kg  slow  bolus  over  one  minute),  the  major  route of  elimination  observed  via 
the faeces (mean of 88.4% of the dose). Urinary excretion accounted for a mean of 11.1% of the dose. 
Elimination of DRM was prolonged, with a mean of 5.2% of the dose eliminated during 96 to 168 hours 
post dose. The mean total recovery of radioactivity (including cage washes) was 100.6% of the dose.

The  effects  of  GSK573719  (0,  26.1,  243  and  1829  mcg/kg/day)  on  the  mRNA  levels  of  liver  CYP450 
genes was investigated in Sprague Dawley rats (3/sex/group) following nose-only inhalation exposure 
(60  minutes/day)  for  28  days  in  a  toxicology  study  (Report  WD2005/01627;  WD2005/01422). 
GSK573719 did not cause any increase in the levels of mRNA of the following CYPs: CYP1A1 (in male 
animals  only),  CYP1A2,  CYP2B1,  CYP2B2,  CYP2E1,  CYP3A2,  CYP3A23  and  CYP4A1  (in  female  animals 
only).  A  small increase  was  observed  in the  levels of  CYP1A1  mRNA  (to  a  mean  ratio  of  treated over 
control  of  8)  in  the  female  livers  at  2000  mcg/kg/day,  although  this  mean  increase  is  due  to  result 
from one rat. Increases in the levels of CYP4A1 mRNA were observed (to a mean ratio of treated over 
control  of  2  and  4)  in  the  male  livers  at  30  and  200  mcg/kg/day  dose  groups.  A  decrease  in  the 
expression of all the CYP mRNA was observed (<50% of control value) in the male livers at the 2000 
mcg/kg/day dose group, despite the housekeeping gene GAPDH being within normal parameters. 
Victim interaction potential 
The  major  routes  of  metabolism  for  GSK573719  in  vitro  in  human  derived  systems  are  mediated 
primarily by CYP2D6 (Report WD2006/03367). GSK573719 was shown to be a substrate of human P-
gp  in  transfected  MDCKII-MDR1  cell  lines  (Report  WD2006/02657)  and  in  mdr1a/b  (P-gp  knockout) 
mice (Report WD2008/00001). Systemic exposure to total DRM increased 18-fold in the P-gp knockout 
mice  compared  to  wildtype  which  is  consistent  with  the  poor  absorption  of  GSK573719  and  P-gp 
having a role in the absorption process. GSK573719 has a low passive membrane permeability which 
will also contribute to poor absorption (Report WD2006/02657). 
GSK573719 is an in vitro substrate for the organic cation uptake transporters OCT1 and OCT2, which 
are  expressed  in  human  liver  and  kidney,  respectively.  The  contribution  of  the  OCTs  to  the  overall 
systemic  clearance of  GSK573719  is  unclear.  Inhibition  of  CYP2D6  and  P-gp  on  the  pharmacokinetics 
of GSK573719 was investigated in two clinical interaction studies. 
Perpetrator interaction potential 
GSK573719  is  an  in  vitro  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  (lowest  mean  IC50  of  1  mcM  following  duplicate 
determinations  using  two  different  probes)  and  CYP2D6  (IC50  of  0.1  mcM)  (Report  CH2005/00950). 
GSK573719 does not inhibit P-gp at concentrations up to 100 mcM (Report WD2006/02596). The Cmax 
of GSK573719 at its maximum proposed commercial dose of 125 mcg/day (<0.2 ng/mL or 0.5 nM) is 
at  least  200-fold  lower  than  the  lowest  IC50  for  CYP2D6  inhibition  (0.1  mcM  or  100  nM)  as  a  worst 
case.  In  line  with  relevant  guidance  a  Ki  value  has  been  calculated  based  on  a  Cmax  of  GSK573719 
(<0.5 nM) and a free concentration of <0.07 nM (assuming protein binding of 86%). The estimated Ki 
for CYP2D6 as a worse case (50 nM) is 710-fold higher than the unbound Cmax and does not therefore 
warrant further clinical investigation (threshold of concern is <50-fold higher). 
Small  changes  in  mRNA  expression  for  CYP1A1  and  CYP4A1  were  observed  following  inhaled 
administration  of  GSK573719  to  the  rat  for  up  to  4  weeks  at  doses  up  to  2000  mcg/kg/day  over 
control rats (Report WD2005/01627). However, as described above, these are small changes and were 
variable between individual animals and not thought to be biologically significant. 
The  inhibition  and  induction  potential  of  GSK573719  at  proposed  inhaled  commercial  dose  (125 
mcg/day) is considered negligible. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Cytochrome P450 induction by GW642444 in animals 
Four  studies  were  performed  in  rats  to  investigate  the  potential  for  GW642444  to  induce  the 
cytochrome  P450  enzymes  following  repeat  inhalation  doses  of  GW642444  as  the  α-phenylcinnamate 
salt,  GW642444H or  as  a triphenulate  salt,  significant,  but  weak  induction  of CYP2B1  mRNA  at  doses 
greater than 890 mcg/kg/day was seen only in male rats dosed for 7 days. No other notable changes

were observed. Minor increases in the levels of CYP2B2 gene expression (to approximately 7-, 6- and 
6-fold the control values) were observed from all dose groups (0, 45.1, 261.1 or 708.7 mcg/kg/day) in 
the  female  rats  dosed  for  4  weeks.    No  other  notable  changes  were  seen  in  males  or  females 
thereafter. 
No  notable  changes  in  either  the  mean  concentrations  of  microsomal  protein  or  total  CYP450  up 
to7087 mcg/kg/day for 4 weeks. In male rats, there was evidence of a small increase in CYP2E activity 
to a maximum of approximately twice the control. Evidence of a marked increase in the production of 
an  unknown  metabolite  of  testosterone  was  observed  in  all  male  dose  groups.  The  identity  and 
biological  significance  of  this  metabolite  is  unknown.  In  addition,  a  small  dose-dependent  increase  in 
the activity of testosterone 7-alpha hydroxylase (up to approximately3 times the mean control activity) 
was observed in the male only. The biological consequence is unknown. 
Finally,  following  daily  dosing  of  GW642444  to  Sprague  Dawley  rats  for  14  days  at  doses  of  up  to 
34422  mcg/kg/day,  there was  no  unequivocal  evidence  of  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  the levels  of 
mRNA for CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B1, 2B2, 2E1, 3A2 (males only, as it is a male specific gene), 3A23 and 4A1. 
No  other  non-clinical  studies  have  been  performed  to  specifically  investigate  the  potential  for 
GW642444 to undergo pharmacokinetic drug interactions when administered concomitantly with other 
drugs  or  foods.  In  toxicology  studies  investigating  the  combination  of  GW642444  with  the 
corticosteroid, GW685698, there was little evidence, in any study, for increased exposure (AUC0-t and 
Cmax)  to  either  GW685698  or  GW642444  (>2-  to  3-fold)  when  dosed  in  combination  compared  to 
when  dosed  alone,  suggesting  that  neither  molecule  interferes  with  the  systemic  clearance  of  the 
other. Likewise, toxicokinetics of GW642444 were generally unaffected following co-administration with 
LAMAs (GSK233705 or GSK573719, two developmental GSK compounds).  
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
No non-clinical studies have been performed to specifically investigate the potential for GW573719 or 
GW642444 to undergo pharmacokinetic drug interactions when administered concomitantly with other 
drugs or foods. In toxicology studies investigating the combination of GW573719 and GW642444, the 
toxicokinetics of GW642444 and GSK573719 were generally unaffected following co-administration. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
GSK573719 and GW642444H or M salt have undergone separate comprehensive non-clinical 
toxicological evaluation in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits to support their longterm clinical use. 
The toxicity of umeclidinium bromide and of vilanterol have been evaluated in an extensive non-clinical 
program. The toxicology program included single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies in four species 
(mice,  rats,  dogs  and  rabbits)  via  four  routes  of  administration  (oral,  subcutaneous,  intravenous  and 
inhalation),  in  vivo  and  in  vitro  genotoxicity  studies,  reproduction  and  developmental  toxicity  studies 
and carcinogenicity studies. Repeat-dose toxicity and reproduction toxicity studies were conducted with 
the  FDC  umeclidinium  bromide/vilanterol.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  the  non-clinical 
development of fixed combinations of medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
Single dose toxicity 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
The toxicity profile of GSK573719 has been defined in single dose studies in rats and mice. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 55/308 
 
  
  
No  single  dose  inhaled  toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  with  GSK573719.  A  summary  of  acute 
toxicity data from dose escalation/dose range finding studies/in vivo genotoxicity and inhalation safety 
pharmacology studies in the rat have been presented. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Single  dose  acute  toxicity  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  GW642444,  except  for  one  study 
designed  to  assess  the  tolerability  of  GW642444  (as  the  α-phenyl  cinnamate  salt)  administered  as  a 
5% dry powder blend in lactose by inhaled administration in beagle dogs.  
In  this  study,  it  was  observed  that  the  administration  of  GW642444  resulted  in  vasodilation  and 
increases  in  pulse  rate.  Pulse  rates  were  elevated  until  12  hours  after  dosing  in  both  the  male  and 
female but were similar to pre-dosing values at 24 hours after completion of dosing. Serum cTnI levels 
were increased in the male, with peak levels being attained 8 hours after dosing.  
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
No  single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  on  the  fixed  dose  combination  umeclidinium 
bromide/vilanteol which was considered acceptable by the CHMP, based on the data available for each 
compound.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
Repeat dose toxicity  studies  investigating the  effects  of  repeated  administration  of  GSK573719  doses 
have been performed in CD-1 mice, Sprague Dawley rats and beagle dogs. To support the long term 
therapeutic  use  of  GSK573719  by  the  inhaled  route,  studies  were  performed  using  this  route  of 
administration  for  periods  up  to  26  weeks  in  the  rat  and  39  weeks  in  the  dog.  Repeat  dose  bridging 
studies  in  the  rat  and  dog  (of  14  days  duration)  have  also  been  performed  to  compare  dry  powder 
formulation  in  lactose  with  and  without  the  excipient  magnesium  stearate  in  order  to  support  the 
clinical formulation.  
Mouse 
13 week inhalation toxicity study (Report WD2007/01600) 
GSK573719 was administered by snout only inhalation for 1 hour per day to CD-1 mice (12/sex/group) 
at estimated achieved doses of 0, 92, 287, 1060 or 2850 mcg/kg/day. An additional 18 animals/sex for 
each GSK573719-treated group and 3 animals/sex in the control group were included for toxicokinetic 
evaluation performed during week 13. 
In the nasal turbinates, test article-related changes were seen in the olfactory and respiratory regions 
of  animals  dosed  at  1060  or  2850  mcg/kg/day,  generally  with  evidence  of  dose  relationship  in 
incidence  and/or degree.  In  the  nasopharynx,  epithelial degeneration/regeneration  was  seen in  a  few 
males  and  females  dosed  at  2850  mcg/kg/day  and  in  two  females  dosed  at  1060  mcg/kg/day. 
Epithelial  eosinophilic  inclusions,  dose-related  in  incidence  and  severity,  were  seen  in  males  and 
females dosed at 1060 or 2850 mcg/kg/day. 
In  the  larynx,  test  article-related  changes  were  seen  in  animals  of  all  groups  given  GSK573719, 
generally with evidence of a dose relationship in incidence and/or degree. Females were affected to a 
slightly  greater  extent  than  males.  At  the  tracheal  bifurcation,  minor  changes  (minimal  epithelial 
hyperplasia  or  loss  of  cilia)  at  the  tracheal  or  bronchial  bifurcation  were  seen  in  a  small  number  of 
animals,  including  a  single  female  control.  A  marginal  increase  in  incidence  was  seen  in  males  and 
females dosed at 2850 mcg/kg/day, compared with controls.

In the spleen, a decreased incidence and severity of extramedullary haemopoiesis was seen in males 
and, to a lesser extent, in females dosed at 2850 mcg/kg/day. Reduced weight gain over the 13 week 
period was seen in both sexes dosed at 1060 or 2850 mcg/kg/day with a lesser effect in females dosed 
at  287  mcg/kg/day.  Food  consumed  by  females  dosed  at  1060  or  2850  mcg/kg/day  was  generally 
lower throughout the study. 
Increased white cell numbers (principally lymphocytes) were seen in both sexes dosed at 92, 287 and 
1060 mcg/kg/day. No effect was seen in either sex dosed at 2850 mcg/kg/day. 
Based  on  the  histopathological  findings  the  NOAEL  was  287  mcg/kg/day.  At  the  NOAEL,  the  mean 
DNAUC0-t  and  DNCmax  values  were  5.70  ng.h/mL  and  2.3  ng/mL,  respectively  (males  and  females 
combined). 
13 week oral toxicity studies (Report WD2010/00349 & Report WD2010/00556) 
GSK573719  as  a  suspension  was  administered  to  groups  of  CD-1  mice  (12/sex/group)  at  doses  of  0 
(vehicle), 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg/day, once daily for up to 13 weeks by oral gavage. 
Seven  animals  (main  study  and  toxicokinetic)  given  300  mg/kg/day  and  one  animal  given  100 
mg/kg/day  were  killed  for  welfare  reasons  on  Day  6  of  the  treatment  period.  Concern  over  the 
prognosis  for  surviving  animals  at  300  mg/kg/day  led  to  their  early  termination  on  Day  6/7.  In 
addition, there was one unscheduled death at 30 mg/kg/day and 9 deaths at 100 mg/kg/day. All but 
one  of  the  unscheduled  deaths  in  all  groups  were  considered  probably  related  to  test  article 
administration.  The  remaining  animal  (a  male  given  100  mg/kg/day)  was  killed  due  to  penis 
mutilation/ventral abdomen ulceration and this death was considered incidental to treatment. 
Noisy  breathing/râles  were  evident  in  several  animals  of  the  300  mg/kg/day  group  at  the  pre-dose 
examination  on  Day  6.  Piloerection  was  observed  at  the  completion  of  dosing  and  into  the  early 
evening  on  Day  6  and  was  apparent  in  surviving  animals  at  the  pre-dose  observation  on  Day  7. 
Abdominal  distension  was  apparent  1  to  2  hours  after  dosing  and  persisted  to  the  early  evening. 
Reduced  body  temperature,  abnormally  elevated  gait,  hunched/flat  posture,  dull  eyes,  gasping  and 
pallor  were  apparent  in  individuals  of  this  group  during  the  working  day  and  early  evening, 
necessitating their premature termination. The remaining animals of this dose group were terminated 
on Day 7. 
The  most  significant  macroscopic  changes  at  necropsy  were  distension  of  the  abdomen,  abnormal 
contents  and  thickening  of  one  or  more  areas  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  In  nearly  all  decedents, 
necrosis/inflammation of the epithelium, sometimes accompanied by the presence of fluid or exudate, 
was observed in the nasal turbinates. This change would have caused blockage of the nasal passages, 
leading  to  breathing  difficulties  and  the  poor  clinical  condition  of  the  animals.  Fundic  degeneration  in 
the stomach, dilatation of various segments of the intestines, glandular degeneration in the duodenum, 
erosions  in  the  jejunum,  erosions,  abscess  and  inflammatory  infiltrate  in  the  caecum  and  epithelial 
hyperplasia  and  erosions  of  the  colon  were  also  present;  these  were  likely  due  either  directly  to  the 
test article or indirectly due to gastrointestinal distension caused by the test article. 
Noisy  respiration/râles  and  piloerection  were  commonly  seen  during  the  remainder  of  the  treatment 
period  in  animals  given  30  or  100  mg/kg/day.  Isolated  incidences  of  abdominal  distension,  flat 
posture, repetitive movements, underactivity, fast, gasping or irregular breathing were noted in other 
individuals  given  100  mg/kg/day.  Two  males  at  30  mg/kg/day  were  noted  with  hunched  posture  on 
one occasion. Dose-related, small or moderate reductions in overall mean body weight gains were seen 
in males and females given 30 or 100 mg/kg/day. 
Haematology investigations during Week 13 revealed markedly reduced overall white blood cell counts 
for  males  and  females  receiving  100  mg/kg/day,  due  primarily  to  low  lymphocyte  counts;  large 
unstained cell counts were also lower than control in males and females given 100 mg/kg/day. Red cell

distribution width was slightly low in males given 30 or 100 mg/kg/day. Similar changes were seen on 
Day  6/7  in  animals,  males  in  particular,  given  300  mg/kg/day.  There  were  no  associated 
histopathological changes. Mean body weight relative kidney weights were slightly higher than control 
in  females  given  30  or  100  mg/kg/day.  Mean  unadjusted  spleen  weights  were  lower  than  control  in 
males and females given 100 mg/kg/day. There were no histopathological correlates for any of these 
organ weight differences. 
At  necropsy  of  animals  killed  after  13  weeks  of  treatment,  elongation  of  the  caecum  was  noted  in  2 
males and 2 females given 100 mg/kg/day.  
A  NOAEL  was  not  identified  in  this  study.  At  30  mg/kg/day  the  mean  AUC0-t  was  9.82  ng.h/mL  and 
Cmax was 3.45 ng/mL (males and females combined).   
As a NOAEL was not identified in the previous 13 week study, an additional 13 week oral repeat dose 
study  was  performed  to  investigate  the  toxicity  and  toxicokinetics  of  GSK573719  at  lower  doses. 
GSK573719  was  given  to  groups  of  CD-1  mice  (12/sex/group)  at  0  (vehicle),  3,  and  10  mg/kg/day 
once  daily  for  13  weeks  by  oral  gavage.  A  further  21  animals/sex  were  added  at  each  treated  dose 
level, and 6 animals/sex received the vehicle, for toxicokinetic evaluation. GSK573719 was formulated 
as a suspension administered to mice at a dose volume of 5 mL/kg. 
There  were  no  deaths.  Fast  respiration  was  seen  in  males  and  females  given  3  or  10  mg/kg/day, 
transiently  after  dosing,  intermittently  from  Week  5  onwards.  Noisy  breathing/râles  was  apparent  on 
isolated occasions in 3 different females receiving 10 mg/kg/day. 
Only stomach and nasal turbinates were examined microscopically since a NOAEL for findings in these 
tissues was not established in the previous 13 week study at higher doses. Test article-related changes 
were present in the nasal turbinates at 10 mg/kg/day; changes were more severe in the female than in 
the  male  animals.  These  changes  were  consistent  with  findings  in  the  previous  study.  There  were  no 
microscopic changes in the stomach. 
On  the  basis  that  the  severity  of  the  changes  in  the  nasal  turbinates  were  graded  marked  in  one 
animal  at  10  mg/kg/day,  3  mg/kg/day  was  considered  to  be  the  NOAEL.  There  was  no  quantifiable 
systemic exposure at this dose. At 10 mg/kg/day overall mean AUC0-t was 0.817 ng.h/mL and Cmax 
was 0.361 ng/mL (males and females combined). 
Rat 
4 week inhalation repeat dose toxicity study (Report WD2005/01244) 
GSK573719  was  administered  by  snout  only  inhalation  for  1  hour  per  day  to  Sprague  Dawley  rats 
(10/sex/group)  at  estimated  achieved  doses  of  0  (vehicle)  or  26.1,  243  or  1829  mcg/kg/day.  An 
additional 3 animals/sex were included at each dose level for toxicokinetic evaluation. 
A decrease in group mean body weights was noted in all treated animals, with values on Day 28 being 
up to 9.8% less in males and 9.2% less in females when compared to controls. In males, body weight 
gain  was  decreased  by  37%,  34%  and  80%  for  animals  receiving  26.1,  243  and  1829  mcg/kg/day, 
respectively,  when  compared  to  controls.  In  females,  body  weight  gain  was  decreased  by  30%  and 
59%  for  animals  receiving  26.1  and  243  mcg/kg/day,  respectively,  when  compared  to  controls. 
Females at 1829 mcg/kg/day showed a 3% loss of body weight on Day 28 when compared to Day 1. 
There  were  slight  increases  in  mean  serum  sodium  and  chloride  levels  in  males  (2  and  2% 
respectively) and females (4 and 5%, respectively) receiving ≥243 mcg/kg/day GSK573719. 
In  the  larynx,  minimal  to moderate epithelial  hyperplasia/squamous  metaplasia  and  minimal or  slight 
subacute and/or chronic inflammation of the submucosa of the ventral region of the larynx was seen at 
all doses.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 58/308 
 
  
  
In  the  nasal  cavities,  minimal  to  marked  degeneration  of  the  olfactory  epithelium  and  minimal  to 
moderate degeneration/regeneration of the respiratory epithelium was seen in all animals given 1829 
mcg/kg/day.  In  animals  given  243  mcg/kg/day,  the  only  change  seen  was  a  minimal  increase  in  the 
incidence of goblet cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium. 
In  the  nasopharynx,  minimal  to  slight  degeneration/regeneration  of  the  respiratory  epithelium  and 
hyperplasia of the goblet cells was present in the nasopharynx of animals given 1829 mcg/kg/day. At 
the  tracheal  bifurcation,  minimal  degeneration/regeneration  of  the  epithelium  was  present  at  the 
carina of males given 243 and both sexes given 1829 mcg/kg/day. 
The NOAEL was 243 mcg/kg/day and is based on the severity of the microscopic changes seen in the 
larynx and nasal cavity in animals receiving 1829 mcg/kg/day. At the NOAEL, mean systemic exposure 
values (DNAUC0-t and DNCmax) were 19.9 ng.h/mL and 6.69 ng/mL, respectively (males and females 
combined). 
14 day inhalation excipient bridging study (Report WD2006/03225) 
The  potential  toxicity  and  toxicokinetics  of  GSK573719  were  evaluated  when  blended  in  lactose 
monohydrate  containing magnesium  stearate during  daily  nose-only  inhalation  exposure  (duration  60 
minutes)  to  the  Sprague  Dawley  rat  for  a  minimum  of  14  consecutive  days  with  that  observed  when 
blended  with  lactose  monohydrate  only  or  lactose  monohydrate  with  COA.  Groups  of  rats 
(10/sex/group)  were  given  daily  doses  of  either  lactose  monohydrate  only,  1%  w/w  magnesium 
stearate  in  lactose  monohydrate  or  estimated  achieved  doses  of  1509,  1498  or  1381  mcg/kg/day  of 
micronized  GSK573719  blended  with  8%  cellobiose  octaacetate  in  lactose  monohydrate,  1%  w/w 
magnesium  stearate  in  lactose  monohydrate  or  lactose  monohydrate  only,  respectively,  at  a  nominal 
concentration of 4% w/w. A further 6 animals/sex were included at each dose to provide samples for 
toxicokinetic evaluation. 
One female rat receiving GSK573719 with the excipient cellobiose octaacetate in lactose monohydrate 
was found dead after dosing in the home cage on Study Day 1. This rat had acute erosions/ulceration 
within the nasal cavity, the larynx (with exudate) and the nasopharynx, however, these changes were 
not considered to be severe enough to have contributed directly to the death of this rat and the cause 
of death could not be determined. 
Lower  group  mean  body  weights  and  body  weight  gains  were  evident  in  all  groups  receiving 
GSK573719 when compared to controls. The changes in body weight gain were as follows (the changes 
in  group  mean  body  weight  were  comparable):  administration  of  GSK573719  with  cellobiose 
octaacetate  /lactose  monohydrate,  magnesium  stearate/lactose  monohydrate or  lactose  monohydrate 
only  resulted  in  a  similarly  lower  body  weight  gain  when  compared  to  the  respective  controls.  The 
effects were less marked in animals receiving the test article in lactose monohydrate alone (0.31X to 
0.42X)  than  with  cellobiose  octaacetate  or  magnesium  stearate  (0.19X  to  -0.34X).  The  difference  in 
body weight response in the different groups was reflective of the differences in systemic exposure. 
Microscopic findings attributed to the administration of GSK573719 were observed in the nasal cavities, 
nasopharynx,  larynx  and  trachea/tracheal  bifurcation.  Minimal  to  moderate  erosion/ulceration  and 
minimal to slight squamous metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium and minimal to slight erosion of the 
respiratory  epithelium  was  observed  in  the  nasal  cavity  of  animals  receiving  GSK573719.  Minimal  to 
moderate degeneration of the olfactory epithelium was also noted, however, this was also observed in 
the  GSK573719  with  lactose  monohydrate  blend,  albeit  only  minimally  (milder  changes  were  seen  in 
the epithelia although the vomeronasal organ was still significantly affected).  
Minimal  to  moderate  hyperplasia/squamous  metaplasia,  subacute  inflammation  and  necrosis  (of  the 
ventral  pouch  cartilage)  were  observed  in  the  larynx  along  with  minimal  to  slight  exudates.  In  the 
tracheal bifurcation, minimal degeneration/regeneration of the epithelium was observed.

The  incidence  of  microscopic  observations  observed  in  the  larynx,  nasal  cavities,  nasopharynx  and 
tracheal  bifurcation  in  animals  receiving  GSK573719  in  lactose  monohydrate  were  generally  notably 
less  than  the  same 
findings  seen 
in  animals  receiving  GSK573719 
in  either  cellobiose 
octaacetate/lactose monohydrate or magnesium stearate/lactose monohydrate. This is likely due to the 
at least 2-fold increase in systemic exposure in the groups containing the excipients and also reflection 
of the slightly increased chamber concentration (and therefore the local concentrations) of GSK573719 
compared to GSK573719/lactose monohydrate. 
On  Day  14,  mean  DNAUC0-t  values  were  186.5,  233  and  79.8  ng.h/mL  for  the  cellobiose 
octaacetate/lactose  monohydrate,  magnesium  stearate/lactose  monohydrate  or  lactose  monohydrate 
alone formulations (males and females combined). 
13 week inhalation toxicity study (Report WD2007/02012) 
The toxicity and toxicokinetics of GSK573719 were evaluated in a 13 week repeat dose study, with a 4 
week  recovery  period,  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats  given  once  daily,  60  minute  doses  by  nose-only 
inhalation  from  a  powder  aerosol  formulation.  Groups  of  rats  (12/sex/group)  were  given  estimated 
achieved doses of micronized GSK573719 at 0 (vehicle, lactose monohydrate with 1% w/w magnesium 
stearate)  or  38,  102,  288  or  924  mcg/kg/day,  with  test  article  formulations  containing  25%  w/w 
GSK573719. An additional 3 animals/sex were included at each dose level for toxicokinetic evaluation 
and  6  animals/sex  were  added  to  the  0  (control)  and  924  mcg/kg/day  dose  groups  for  recovery 
evaluations. 
The  cause  of  death  of  two  main  study  rats  (102  and  288  mcg/kg/day  groups)  found  dead  on  study 
Days 74 and 27, respectively, could not be determined histopathologically. As there was no mortality 
in the 924 mcg/kg/day group, they were not thought to be related to test article. 
Administration of GSK573719 by nose-only inhalation to male and female rats for 13 weeks resulted in 
changes in the upper respiratory tract in male and female rats from all treated groups. The changes in 
the  larynx  and  nasal  cavities/sinuses  were  generally  consistent  with  local  irritation  to  GSK573719. 
Changes  in  the  larynx  consisting  of  squamous  metaplasia  and  necrosis  of  the  ventral  pouch  cartilage 
were seen in all dose groups and there was a clear dose response in their incidence and/or severity 
Hyperplasia/hypertrophy of goblet cells were seen at all dose levels (except 38 mcg/kg/day females). 
Inflammation 
and/or 
exudate  were 
sporadically 
seen 
at 
≥102  mcg/kg/day. 
The 
degeneration/regeneration  in  the  respiratory  epithelium  seen  at  924  mcg/kg/day  at  the  moderate 
grade in one male and one female was considered the only adverse finding in this study. 
Following  a  4  week  recovery  period,  persistence  of  GSK573719-related  findings  were  found  in  male 
and female rats at 924 mcg/kg/day in the larynx (squamous metaplasia ventrolateral and submucosal 
glands,  necrosis  and 
inflammation)  and  nasal 
cavity/sinuses 
(degeneration/regeneration 
respiratory/olfactory epithelium), but in a lower degree in incidence and/or severity compared to those 
observed in animals killed at the end of treatment. 
In males at doses of ≥102 mcg/kg/day and females at 924 mcg/kg/day, body weight gain was reduced 
throughout  the  main  phase  of  the  study.  This  generally  correlated  with  a  reduction  of  food 
consumption  throughout  the  main  phase  of  the  study.  In  recovery,  body  weight  gains  returned  to 
normal. 
Minimal  decreases  in  reticulocytes  were  observed  in  females  given  GSK573719  at  a  dose  of  924 
mcg/kg/day.  These  changes  were  of  low  amplitude,  had  no  microscopic  correlate  and  were  not 
observed at the end of the recovery period. 
The  NOAEL  was  288  mcg/kg/day  [mean  DNAUC0-t  was  16.2  ng.h/mL  and  mean  DNCmax  was  3.79 
ng/mL (males and females combined)].

26 week inhalation toxicity study (Report FD2009/00467) 
The toxicity and toxicokinetics of GSK573719 were assessed in a 26 week repeat dose study, with a 6 
week  recovery  period,  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats  given  once  daily,  60  minute  doses  by  nose-only 
inhalation  from  a  powder  aerosol  formulation.  Groups  of  rats  (12/sex/group)  were  given  estimated 
achieved doses of micronized GSK573719 at 0 (vehicle, lactose monohydrate with 1% w/w magnesium 
stearate)  or  87.1,  289  or  987  mcg/kg/day.  The  test  article  formulations  contained  either  2.5%  w/w 
GSK573719 (87.1 and 289 mcg/kg/day) or 25% w/w GSK573719 (987 mcg/kg/day). An additional 3 
animals/sex  were  included  at  each  dose  level  for  toxicokinetic  evaluation  and  6  animals/sex  were 
added to the 0 (vehicle) and 987 mcg/kg/day dose groups for recovery evaluations. 
There  were  4  pre-terminal  deaths  during  the  treatment  period.  On  Day  81,  one  male  control  animal, 
assigned  to  the  recovery  phase,  was  found  dead  during  unloading  from  the  inhalation  chamber 
following exposure.  On  Day  86,  one  female  control animal,  also  assigned to the  recovery  phase,  was 
found dead following bleeding procedures. On Day 28, one toxicokinetic female given 289 mcg/kg/day 
was  found  dead  following blood  collection.  Following  blood  collection  on  Day  85,  the  condition  of  one 
toxicology  male  given  987  mcg/kg/day  deteriorated  and  it  was  subsequently  found  dead  on  Day  90. 
With  the  exception  of  the  male  given  987  mcg/kg/day,  there  were  no  adverse  clinical  observations 
reported  prior  to  the  animals  being  found  dead.  Although  the  cause  of  death  was  not  determined 
histopathologically for any of these animals, they are considered not to have been test article-related, 
but rather related to procedures. 
Microscopic changes were observed in the nasal cavity/sinuses (≥87.1 mcg/kg/day), nasopharynx (987 
mcg/kg/day),  larynx  (≥87.1  mcg/kg/day),  tracheal  bifurcation  (≥289  mcg/kg/day)  and  lungs  (≥87.1 
mcg/kg/day) in male and female rats given the test article and were partially or completely reversible 
following cessation of treatment for a 6 week period. 
Minimal  squamous  metaplasia  was  seen  in  the  tracheal  bifurcation  of  males  and  females  given  ≥289 
mcg/kg/day. 
Lungs  of  males  and  females  from  all  groups  given  the  test  article,  including  control  animals,  had 
minimal to slight macrophage accumulation, with an increase in incidence and severity in males given 
987 mcg/kg/day. This finding correlated with pale areas of the lung noted macroscopically. 
Following a 6 week off-dose period, the changes in the nasal cavity/sinuses, nasopharynx, larynx and 
lungs  were  still  present,  but  in  general  with  a  reduced  incidence  and  severity.  Additionally,  in  two 
treated males there was regeneration of the laryngeal ventral cartilage. 
Throughout  the  treatment  period,  minimal  increases  in  group  mean  neutrophil  count  (1.32X  to  1.4X 
mean control) were observed in males given 87.1 and 289 mcg/kg/day (at Weeks 4 and 13), and mild 
increases (1.24X to 1.74X mean control) in males given 987 mcg/kg/day (at Weeks 4, 13 and 26). The 
decrease  in  magnitude  of  the  changes  (from  1.74X  to  1.51X  to  1.24X  control)  seen  in  animals  given 
987  mcg/kg/day  over  the  course  of  the  study  reflected  increases  in  the  group  mean  absolute 
neutrophil  counts  in  concurrent  controls  over  the  duration  of  the  study.  This  change  persisted  at  the 
end of the recovery period in males (1.21X control) that had previously been given 987 mcg/kg/day, 
however,  individual  absolute  values  were  decreased  compared  to  respective  values  measured  at  the 
end of the treatment period. 
Minimal increases in serum urea in males given 987 mcg/kg/day in Weeks 13 (1.11X control) and 26 
(1.13X control) were noted. Values were comparable to controls at the end of the recovery period. 
In  animals  given  ≥87.1  mcg/kg/day,  dose-related,  mild  reductions  in  mean  overall  body  weight  gain 
were observed (up to 0.79X controls for males, up to 0.72X controls for females). During the off-dose 
period, the mean overall weight gain of animals previously given 987 mcg/kg/day increased compared 
to that of the controls (1.2X for males and 1.3X for females), indicating reversibility.

Due  to  the  adverse  findings  in  the  larynx  the  NOAEL  was  considered  to  be  87.1  mcg/kg/day  [mean 
DNAUC0-t 8.08 ng.h/mL; mean DNCmax 1.55 ng/mL (males and females combined)]. 
Dog 
4 week inhalation toxicity study (Report WD2005/01423) 
GSK573719 blended in lactose monohydrate at a nominal concentration of 4% w/w with a nominal 8% 
w/w  micronized  cellobiose  octaacetate,  was  administered  to  groups  of  dogs  (3/sex/group)  once  daily 
for 60 minutes. The estimated achieved doses were 0 (vehicle), 16.2, 208 or 2758 mcg/kg/day. 
There  was  a  treatment-related  decrease  in  absolute  overall  body  weight  gains  with  males  at  208 
mcg/kg/day gaining 0.10 kg versus a gain of 0.50 kg in the controls. Males receiving 2758 mcg/kg/day 
lost 0.17 kg on average. Likewise, females at 208 mcg/kg/day gained 0.13 kg versus a gain of 0.40 kg 
in the controls. Females receiving 2758 mcg/kg/day lost 0.13 kg on average. 
Food  consumption  was  consistently  decreased  over  the  course  of  the  study  in  females  given  208 
mcg/kg/day (-9.6%) and 2758 mcg/kg/day (-8.6%) when compared with pre-treatment values. In the 
males this decrease was noted at 2758 mcg/kg/day in Weeks 1 (-13.8%) and 2 (-5.0%) only. 
GSK573719 did not appear to have any effects on ECG recordings with the exception of a mild positive 
chronotropic effect observed at 2758 mcg/kg/day during Week 4. On Day 1, marked treatment-related 
increases in heart rates (47% for males and 62% for females compared to pre-dose values) were seen 
in animals receiving 2758 mcg/kg/day with heart rates not returning to their pre-dose values up to 23 
hours after dosing. On Days 2 to 7, heart rates of animals treated at 2758 mcg/kg/day continued to be 
elevated with the average of post dose heart rates being increased by 45% for males and by 62% for 
females  compared  to  controls.  On  Day  28,  pre-dose  heart  rates  were  increased  by  25%  or  20%  for 
males  and  females,  respectively,  treated  at  208  mcg/kg/day  and  by  25%  or  58%  for  males  and 
females, respectively, treated at 2758 mcg/kg/day compared to Day 1 pre-dose heart rates.  
GSK573719-related changes were observed in the nasal cavity, larynx, trachea, lungs and thymus.  
Minimal to moderate lymphoid atrophy was noted in the thymus at all doses with increased severity at 
208 and 2758 mcg/kg/day. A small thymus was noted in one female at 2758 mcg/kg/day. 
Seminiferous  tubules  were  evaluated  with  respect  to  their  stage  in  the  spermatogenic  cycle  and  the 
integrity  of  the  various  cell  types  present  within  the  different  stages.  No  cell-  or  stage-specific 
abnormalities were noted. 
Based  on  the  microscopic  changes  in  the  nasal  cavities,  larynx  and  trachea  at  2758  mcg/kg/day  the 
NOAEL would be 208 mcg/kg/day, however, in view of the adverse inflammatory findings in the lungs 
an overall NOAEL for this study could not be determined. 
Mean  systemic  exposure  at  an  estimated  achieved  dose  of  2758  mcg/kg/day  resulted  in  a  combined 
calculated DNAUC0-t of 195 ng.h/mL and combined calculated DNCmax of 83.7 ng/mL for GSK573719 
based  on  Day  28  values.  The  toxicokinetic  parameters  were  not  reported  for  the  other  doses  due  to 
high variability. 
4 week inhalation study investigating feeding regimen (Report WD2006/03294) 
In  an  effort  to  investigate  the  effect  of  feeding  modifications  designed  to  reduce  the  possibility  of 
particules  inhalation,  on  the  formation  of  granulomas  in  the  lung  seen  in  the  previous  4  week 
inhalation toxicity study in the dog, groups of dogs (3/sex/group) were given estimated achieved doses 
of  0  (vehicle),  22,  2254  (new  feeding  regime)  or  1835  (old  feeding  regime)  mcg/kg/day  GSK573719 
once  daily  for  60  minutes  via  oropharyngeal  inhalation.  One  group  of  dogs  given  a  dose  of  1835 
mcg/kg/day was given dry pelleted diet prior to dosing for approximately 6 hours (commencing in the 
morning), and removed generally during dosing or up to 40 minutes following the completion of dosing

(identified as old feeding regimen). The feeding regimen for 3 groups of dogs given the test article at 
doses of 0 (vehicle), 22 or 2254 mcg/kg/day was modified to provide pelleted diet mixed with water 3 
hours after completion of dosing for a period of 2 hours (identified as new feeding regimen). 
Treatment-related  clinical  signs  included  dry  mouth  (i.e.  dry  muzzle  and  dry  gums)  and  dry  eyes 
observed  at  doses  ≥22  mcg/kg/day,  with  the  incidence  more  prevalent  in  dogs  given  1835 
mcg/kg/day/old feeding regimen and 2254 mcg/kg/day/new feeding regimen. 
Overall  body  weight  loss  was  noted  at  the  end  of  the  treatment  period  in  animals  given  1835 
mcg/kg/day/old  feeding  regimen  (up  to  0.95X  Day  1  body  weight).  Food  consumption  was  generally 
decreased during Weeks 1 and 2 of the study in both males and females given 1835 mcg/kg/day/old 
feeding  regimen  when  compared  with  Week  -1  pre-treatment  values  (Week  1  =  0.56X  and  0.63X; 
Week 2 = 0.76X and 0.94X). 
The Schirmer tear test revealed that moisture content of the eyes of dogs given 2254 mcg/kg/day/new 
feeding regimen and dogs given 1835 mcg/kg/day/old feeding regimen were reduced in Weeks 1 and 4 
(up  to  0.06X  and  0.07X  control  mean,  respectively)  when  compared  to  control  values.  Unilateral 
conjunctival  hyperemia  and  mucoid  discharge  was  noted  in  one  dog  of  each  of  the  2254 
mcg/kg/day/new  feeding  regimen  and  1835  mcg/kg/day/old  feeding  regimen  doses,  and  was 
accompanied  by  slight  corneal  edema  and  vascularization  in  one  eye  (one  female  animal  at  1835 
mcg/kg/day/old feeding regimen). While these findings were considered not to represent a direct effect 
of the test article on the eyes, they were considered to be a secondary response to tear deficiency and 
were considered adverse. 
Heart  rate  (measured  by  stethoscope)  was  increased  for  dogs  given  1835  mcg/kg/day/old  feeding 
regimen and 2254 mcg/kg/day/new feeding regimen on Day 1 (up to 2.94X pre-dose), with peak heart 
rates generally noted within 1 hour of completion of dosing. Heart rates remained elevated at 23 hours 
after  completion  of  dosing.  There  was  no  change  in  heart  rate  following  dosing  on  Day  25,  although 
pre-dose values were higher on Day 25 when compared with Day 1 pre-dose values (up to 1.47X). Mild 
to  moderate  increases  in  heart  rate  were  also  noted  at  2254  mcg/kg/day/new  feeding  regimen  and 
1835 mcg/kg/day/old feeding regimen during Week 4 (Day 27) ECG evaluation. 
There was a mild increase in serum triglycerides in males given GSK573719 at 2254 mcg/kg/day/new 
feeding regimen. 
Microscopic  findings  considered  to  be  related  to  the  old  feeding  regimen  were  seen  in  the  lungs. 
Microscopic  findings  considered  to  be  related  to  GSK573719  were  seen  in  the  nasal  cavity/sinuses, 
larynx, trachea and bronchi. The larynx had similar changes from irritation that consisted of epithelial 
degeneration/necrosis,  acute  inflammation  and/or  exudate.  Tracheal  findings  consisted  of  acute 
inflammation,  epithelial  degeneration/regeneration,  epithelial  necrosis  and  exudate.  Bronchi  had 
sporadic  and  infrequent  minimal  epithelial  degeneration/regeneration  and/or  acute  inflammation  in 
dogs receiving 2254 mcg/kg/day/new feeding regimen as well as small bronchi within the lungs in one 
2254  mcg/kg/day/new  feeding  regimen  and  1835  mcg/kg/day/old  feeding  regimen  female.  One  22 
mcg/kg/day/new feeding regimen male had minimal acute inflammation of the bronchi. 
Mean  systemic  exposure  (DNAUC0-t)  was  278  ng.h/mL  at  doses  of  2254  mcg/kg/day  for  the  new 
feeding regimen and 284 ng.h/mL at a dose of 1835 mcg/kg/day for the old feeding regimen. Systemic 
exposure  at  a  dose  of  22  mcg/kg/day/new  feeding  regimen  group  was  not  be  reported  due  to  the 
variability of the data. 
13 week inhalation toxicity study (Report WD2007/01512) 
Groups  of  beagle  dogs  (4 dogs/sex/group  with  an  additional  2 dogs/sex  in  the  vehicle  and  high  dose 
group  held  for  recovery  evaluation)  were  exposed  to  dry  powder  formulations  of  micronized 
GSK573719 in  lactose  monohydrate  at  a  nominal  concentration  of  40%  w/w  with  a  nominal  1%  w/w

magnesium stearate by inhalation administration via oropharyngeal tube at estimated achieved doses 
of 0 (vehicle), 40.7, 187 or 1070 mcg/kg/day. 
Dry  mouth  was  seen  at  a  higher  incidence  in  all  groups  given  GSK573719  immediately  following  and 
up  to  1  hour  post  dose  when  compared  to  controls.  Excessive  salivation  was  seen  in  all  groups 
(including  controls)  during  dosing  and  mainly  immediately  post  dose,  but  was  noted  at  a  higher 
incidence in animals given 1070 mcg/kg/day. Dry mouth and excessive salivation were not observed in 
individual animals on the same occasion. Dry nose was noted during dosing, immediately post dosing 
in  animals  given  the  test  article  and  was  not  present  in  controls.  Swollen  neck  was  observed  during 
dosing  and  at  a  higher  incidence  immediately  post  dose,  starting  during  Week  10  in  groups  given 
GSK573719. Changes noted during the treatment period resolved during the recovery period. 
In  Week  13,  at  pre-dose,  3/6  males  and  4/6  females  given  1070  mcg/kg/day  showed  no  respiratory 
sinus  arrhythmia  (RSA)  (expressed  by  decreased  RR  interval  variability)  and  all  dogs  given  1070 
mcg/kg/day had increased heart rates (up to 1.8X pre-test individual values). Immediately following a 
dose of 1070 mcg/kg/day, no RSA was noted in 4/6 males and 4/6 females, which was associated with 
further increases in heart rates (up to 2.1X pre-dose individual values) in 2/6 males and 3/6 females. 
The changes in most animals were returned to pre-test values, but RSA was not observed in females 
during the recovery phase. 
In  Week  1,  a  test  article-related  decrease  in  tear  production  was  noted  in  animals  given  GSK573719 
(0.2  to  0.9X  pre-test  mean  values).  In  Weeks  4  and  13  (pre-  and  post  dose),  a  decrease  in  tear 
production was noted in animals given 1070 mcg/kg/day (0.2 to 0.7X pre-test mean values), in Week 
13 (pre- and post dose), decreased tear production was noted in animals given 187 mcg/kg/day (0.6 
to 0.8X  pre-test  mean  values).  At  the  end  of the  recovery  phase,  tear  production  was  comparable to 
pre-test values for animals given 1070 mcg/kg/day. 
There were minimal to mildly higher serum cTnI concentrations at 3, 7 and/or 24 hours, peaking at 7 
hours  (0.189  and  0.171  mcg/L)  on  Day  1  for  one  male  and  one  female  animal,  respectively,  given 
1070 mcg/kg/day when compared to their pre-dose values and concurrent controls. By Week 13 and at 
the  end  of  the  recovery  period,  the  serum  cTnI  concentrations  were  comparable  to  pre-dose  and 
concurrent controls. 
Moderate  amounts  of  black/granular  material  noted  in  the  gall  bladder  of  one  male  given  1070 
mcg/kg/day  at  the  end  of  treatment  was  not  associated  with  any  microscopic  changes  in  the  gall 
bladder  itself  or  present  in  any  animal  at  the  end  of  recovery.  The  relationship  to  treatment  is 
uncertain. 
None of the changes seen in this study were considered to be adverse, therefore, the NOAEL was 1070 
mcg/kg/day [mean DNAUC0-t 22.5 ng.h/mL, mean DNCmax 14.6 ng/mL (for males and females based 
on Week 13 values)]. 
39 week inhalation toxicity study (Report FD2009/00466) 
Micronized GSK573719 was administered as a dry powder formulation blended in lactose monohydrate 
at  a  nominal  concentration  of  35%  w/w  with  a  nominal  1.0%  w/w  magnesium  stearate.  Groups  of 
beagle dogs (4 dogs/sex/group with an additional 2 dogs/sex in the vehicle and high dose group held 
for  recovery  evaluation)  were  exposed  at  estimated  achieved  doses  of  0  (vehicle),  109,  421  or  1002 
mcg/kg/day daily. 
Moderate subacute inflammation of the extramural coronary arteries was seen in one male given 421 
mcg/kg/day  and  one  female  given  1002  mcg/kg/day.  In  addition,  there  was  mild  intimal  thickening 
with minimal areas of mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate in an arteriole in the lung in one female given 
1002  mcg/kg/day.  These  changes  were  not  seen  following  the  6  week  recovery  period.  A  definite 
relationship to the test article could not be established owing to the low incidence of changes and the

lack  of  systemic  exposure  relationship.  These  changes  are  consistent  with  a manifestation  of  a  latent 
spontaneous disease precipitated by treatment. However, in the absence of similar vascular changes in 
concurrent  controls  or  in  the  background  data  from  this  laboratory,  the  NOAEL  for  this  change  is 
conservatively set at 109 mcg/kg/day. 
Test  article-related  changes  were  seen 
in  the  upper  respiratory  tract  (minimal  to  slight 
erosion/ulceration of the mucosal epithelium and slight inflammation of the mucosal gland/hyperplasia 
of the squamous epithelium in the larynx and squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium of the 
nasal turbinates) in animals given ≥421 mcg/kg/day. 
These  changes  were  consistent  with  a  local  irritant  effect  of  the  test  article  and  were  found  to  be 
reversible  in  animals  previously  given  1002  mcg/kg/day  at  the  end  of  a  6  week  off-dose  recovery 
period.  Changes  in  the  nasal  cavity  and  larynx  in  animals  given  ≥421  mcg/kg/day  at  the  end  of  the 
dosing period were considered to be a local irritant response to the test article and non-adverse. 
Dry mouth was observed immediately after dosing in all groups, including controls. Bilateral swelling of 
the neck and excessive salivation observed during and immediately after dosing were also seen in all 
groups. The incidence and frequency of these observations were greater in animals given GSK573719 
and  were  dose-related.  Though  the  swelling  generally  persisted  until  the  end  of  the  day,  it  was  only 
measurable (up to 40 mm in diameter) up to 4.5 hours after the completion of dosing. Radiographs of 
the  swollen  areas  and  cytological  examination  of  the  fluid  collected  from  these  areas,  the  latter  of 
which  only  confirmed  the  presence  of  salivary  gland  cells,  did  not  reveal  any  information  on  the 
mechanism  of  the  swelling.  The  frequency  of  abnormal  stool  findings  (unformed,  watery  and/or  with 
mucus)  was  decreased  in  animals  given  GSK573719  when  compared  to  controls.  This  reduction  in 
occurrence  was  more  apparent  and  also  dose  related  in  males.  These  observations  were  no  longer 
evident during the recovery period. 
Increased femoral pulse rates (up to 1.51 and 1.53X in males and females, respectively) were noted in 
both  sexes  given  ≥109  mcg/kg/day  at  all  intervals  commencing  immediately  after  the  completion  of 
dosing, which is also generally when peak exposure values occurred. Pulse rates returned to baseline 
levels between 1 and 3 hours after the completion of dosing. In both sexes, the effect on pulse rates 
diminished  at  Week  39  when  compared  to  previous  intervals.  ECGs  taken  prior  to  and  immediately 
after dosing during Week 39 confirmed the increased heart rates (up to 1.50 and 1.61X in males and 
females, respectively).  
Minimal  increases  in  group  mean  serum  cTnI  concentrations  were  noted  in  the  majority  of  females 
given ≥421 mcg/kg/day at 4 and 8 hours after the start of dosing on Day 1 (up to 11.6X and 7.4X pre-
dose, respectively). A near complete return to baseline was achieved by 24 hours after the start of the 
previous  day’s  dose.  A  male  given  421  mcg/kg/day  demonstrated  an  increased  serum  cTnI 
concentration at 4 and 8 hours after the start of dosing, with partial return to baseline levels seen at 
24 hours. The change in this single male is of uncertain relationship to the test article owing to a raised 
baseline value for the animal and the isolation of this finding in males. 
Decreased tear production (up to 0.11X pre-test for both sexes) was noted during Weeks 1, 4, 13, 26 
and 39 in animals given GSK573719. While reductions were apparent prior to dosing, their magnitude 
was  even  greater  after  dosing.  At  the  end  of  the  recovery  phase,  tear  production  was  comparable  to 
pre-test and control values for animals previously given 1002 mcg/kg/day.  
Lower  thymus  weights  (up  to  0.54X  controls)  were  seen  in  males  given  1002  mcg/kg/day.  After  6 
weeks  of  recovery,  thymus  weight  was  still  slightly  lower  than  controls  in  one  male  previously  given 
1002 mcg/kg/day (0.46X). There was no histopathological correlate with this finding.

Slight decreases in haemoglobin, hematocrit and red blood cell count (up to 0.91X controls) were seen 
in  males  given  ≥109  mcg/kg/day  at  Week  39.  At  the  end  of  the  recovery  period,  these  parameters 
were still slightly lower than controls (0.91X). 
Slight increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during Weeks 26 and 39 were seen in both sexes given 
1002 mcg/kg/day (1.38X and 1.27X controls in males and females, respectively), which were no longer 
evident after 6 weeks of recovery. 
A definitive relationship to the test article could not be established for the inflammatory changes seen 
in the extramural coronary arteries of the heart in a male given 421 and a female given 1002 
mcg/kg/day and in the pulmonary arteriole of another female given 1002 mcg/kg/day owing to the low 
incidence of these findings and absence of systemic exposure relationship. Although the changes are 
consistent with a manifestation of latent spontaneous disease precipitated by treatment, a 
conservative approach has been taken during assessment of these changes in the absence of similar 
findings in concurrent controls or in the historical data base at this laboratory. Based on the occurrence 
of the vascular lesions in the heart or lungs in dogs given 421 or 1002 mcg/kg/day, the NOAEL is 
considered to be 109 mcg/kg/day. At the NOAEL, mean DNCmax and DNAUC0-t values were 7.65 
ng/mL and 11.2 ng.hr/mL, respectively (males and females combined). 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
The  toxicity  profile  of  GW642444  has  been  investigated  adequately  in  repeat  dose  inhaled  toxicity 
studies of up to 13 weeks in mice, 26 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in dogs. Identified NOAELs ocurred 
generally at doses achieving systemic exposures at large multiples of those seen in human patients at 
the proposed commercial dose of 25 mcg/day (13 week mice study NOAEL=38200 mcg/kg/day (4500 
(Cmax) or 2210-fold (AUC)); 26 week female rats study NOAEL=57.7 mcg/kg/day (31 (Cmax) or 20-
fold (AUC)); 26 week male rats study NOAEL=10253 mcg/kg/day (5680 (Cmax) or 2630-fold (AUC)); 
39  week  toxicity  dogs  study  NOAEL=62.5  mcg/kg/day  (305  (Cmax)  or  124-fold  (AUC)).  Toxicological 
findings  in  these  studies were  mostly  associated  with  the  primary  pharmacology  and  seen  with  other 
marketed beta2 agonists. These findings are described below. 
The  principal  toxicity  of  GW642444  was  in  the  heart  and  cardiovascular  system.  GW642444  caused 
tachycardia,  vasodilation,  heart  lesions  in  dogs.  Microscopic  changes  (predominantly  myocardial 
fibrosis) in the papillary muscle of the heart which correlated with increase in heart-rate were seen in 
most  studies.  In  the  13  and  39  week  studies  in  dogs,  NOAELs  for  papillary  muscle  changes  were 
identified  as  9.3  and  62.5  mcg/kg/day,  respectively  (systemic  exposures  26-  or  124-times  those 
achieved in humans at the proposed commercial dose). However, the dose of 0.953 mcg/kg/day with 
and without GW685698 in the 4 week combination toxicity study, produced myocardial fibrosis of the 
interventricular septum. In addition, increases in serum cTnI were noted in some dogs. Cardiovascular 
responses  in  the  dog  were  expected  effects  in  dogs  experiencing  beta2-agonist  peripheral 
vasodilatation and reflex tachycardia. Such lesions could not be relevant to the use in humans at the 
proposed  commercial  dose  because  tachycardia  occurred  at  exposure  44-fold  the  human  exposure  at 
the proposed commercial dose. 
In the upper respiratory tract, GW642444 produced irritancy in mice, rats and dogs. In rats, minimal 
to  marked  microscopic  changes  in  nasal  cavity  /  sinuses,  nasopharynx  and  larynx  at  ≥10253 
mcg/kg/day  were  observed  in  the  13  or  26  week  toxicity  studies.  In  mice,  this  finding  which  was  its 
principal  toxicity  was  noted  at  ≥  1020  mcg/kg/day  in  the  13  week  study,  with  nasal  turbinates  and 
larynx being the primary sites, as well as an increased of luminal inflammatory cells/cell debris in the 
nasal  cavity  from  females  at  all  doses  and  olfactory  degenerative  changes  at  ≥62  mcg/kg/day  in  the 
mouse carcinogenicity study. In dogs, this finding was observed in the 39 week inhaled toxicity study, 
in the respiratory epithelium of all treated groups and in the squamous and transitional epithelia of a 
single  male  given  510  mcg/kg/day.  In  addition,  minimal  to  moderate  lymphoid  cell  infiltrate  in  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 66/308 
 
  
  
lamina  propria  of  the  olfactory  epithelium  was  seen  in  animals  given  ≥62.5mcg/kg/day.  The  upper 
respiratory  tract  irritancy  determined  the  NOAEL  in  the  13  week  study  in  rat  and  was  the  main  test 
article-related  finding  in  the  13  week  study  in  mouse.  The  findings  observed  in  rats  and  mice  are 
considered  not  to  predict  unacceptable  irritancy  in  humans,  as  the  larynx  is  a  particularly  sensitive 
area of the respiratory tract in rodents and since GW642444 was given for an extended period of time 
which contrasts sharply with the oral inhalation method in humans. The changes in the nasal cavities 
of  dogs  are  also  not  of  concern  as  they  were  only  seen  at  high  doses  administered  by  oronasal 
facemask over a 30 or 60 minute period each day. 
In the lung, it was observed greater incidence of focal pulmonary haemorrhage in rats dosed up to 4 
weeks  duration.  However,  this  effect  is  not  considered  to  be  of  relevance  to  humans  because  it  was 
limited to the rat, resulted from deposited lung doses 37-fold to 25800-fold the proposed commercial 
dose of GW642444 and was seen with similar incidence in control rats. 
Metabolic  effects  produced  by  GW642444  included  increased  weight  gain  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  at 
most dose levels within the majority of studies, which is a result from an alteration in the distribution 
of fat, enhanced protein synthesis and a reduction in protein degradation in muscle; variable changes 
in serum or plasma protein, albumin, urea and /or creatinine concentrations in mouse, rat and/or dog 
after 13 and or 26/39 weeks treatment which are secondary to the changes in muscle mass and do not 
represent a toxic event. These effects are considered not to represent a hazard to human health since 
there  have  been  no  consequences  with  other  beta2  agonists  in  clinical  use.  Reduction  in  plasma 
glucose  concentrations  in  rats  at  all  doses  in  the  13  and  26  week  studies  have  also  been  observed, 
which may be due to an overcompensation of insulin response to an acute rise in glucose; decrease in 
triglyceride  levels  in  rats  at  ≥657.9  mcg/kg/day  which  is  likely  to  be  related  to  the  beta-adrenergic 
stimulation  of  lipolysis;  changes  in  electrolytes  in  rats  at  all  doses  which  have  been  suggested  to  be 
due to increased tissue uptake or a secondary effect resulting from an increase in insulin. 
In addition, minimal increase in serum alkaline phosphatase activity and bilirubin concentration and a 
decrease  in  serum  alanine  aminotransferase  activity  in  rats  at  doses  ≥658  mcg/kg/day  have  been 
observed  in  the  13  week  toxicity  study.  These  changes  are  considered  not  to  represent  a  hazard  to 
human since none were noted during the rat 26 week study at doses achieving AUC0-t exposures up to 
2500-fold greater than those in humans at the proposed commercial dose.  
Changes produced by GW642444 in hepatocyte rarefaction were seen in the 13 and/or 39 weeks study 
in  dogs  at  doses  ≥9.3  mcg/kg/day  (<21-fold  human  exposure)  and  in  mice  at  doses  ≥6490 
mcg/kg/day (312-fold human exposure). It was showed that these changes in rarefaction were due to 
alterations in glycogen distribution which were fully reversible.  
Haematology  changes  in dogs  included increase  in platelet  count  at  the  highest  dose tested  (2010  to 
571 mcg/kg/day) in the 4 week study, increase in white blood cell count, primarily due to neutrophils 
and monocytes, at 501 mcg/kg in the 13 week study, slight reduction in haemoglobin in female given 
510  mcg/kg/day  during  the  39  week  study.  In  rats,  increase  in  neutrophil  and/or  monocyte  counts, 
along with very small reductions in erythrocyte parameters were noted at 34422 mcg/kg/day with an 
increase  in  reticulocyte  count  apparent  at  ≥625  mcg/kg/day  in  the  14  day  study,  and  reversible 
reductions in platelet counts at ≥56.2 mcg/kg/day (13 weeks) or ≥537 mcg/kg/day (26 weeks). At the 
NOEL  for  haematological  changes  in  the  26  week  study  in  rats  (57.7mcg/kg/day)  and  the  39-week 
study  in  dogs  (62.5  mcg/kg/day),  AUC0-t  was  20-  or  124-fold  greater,  respectively,  than  human 
AUC0-t  at  the  proposed  commercial  dose,  thus  these  findings  are  considered  not  relevant  for  human 
safety at this dose. 
In the thymus, GW642444 was associated with increase of thymic involution/atrophy in dogs at doses 
of  ≥137,  ≥64.2,  ≥9.3  and  510  mcg/kg/day  administered  for  14  days  or  4,  13  or  39  weeks, 
respectively. In dogs, although seen at all doses in the 13 week study in which AUC0-t was ≥26-fold 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 67/308 
 
  
  
greater  than  that  at  the  proposed  human  commercial  dose,  in  the  39  week  study  at  the  NOEL  (62.5 
mcg/kg/day),  AUC0-t  was  124-fold  greater  than  human.  Furthermore,  involution/atrophy  of  the 
thymus  is  a  normal  age-related  change  in  dogs  which  is  often  further  advanced  with  experimental 
stress and is considered not relevant for humans.  
In the female reproductive tract, GW642444 was associated with dose-related myometrial hypertrophy 
seen at doses ≥1020 mcg/kg/day in mouse in the 13 week study and at ≥62 mcg/kg/day in the mouse 
carcinogenicity  study.  The  fact  that  no  myometrial  hypertrophy  in  the  13  week  mouse  study  at  58.6 
mcg/kg/day  (35-fold  human  exposure)  have  been  observed  suggests  the  uterine  changes  have  no 
relevance  to  human  use  at  the  proposed  commercial  dose.  There  was  also  an  increase  of  cystic 
endometrial  hyperplasia  in  all  treated  groups  in  the  mouse  carcinogenicity  study  which  will  be 
discussed in the carcinogenicity part. 
In  rats,  reversible  decrease  of  recent  corpora  lutea,  increase  of  dilated  or  cystic  follicles  in  the  ovary 
and increase of females in a proestrus or estrus state in the 26 weeks study at ≥537 mcg/kg/day have 
been  observed.  At  the  same  doses  in  the  mammary  gland  of  rats,  non-reversible  increase  of  acinar 
development  and  secretory  activity,  as  well  as  incidences  of  lobular  hyperplasia  with  atypia  and/or 
mammary adenoma have been observed. The NOAEL for these effects in rats is 57.7 mcg/kg/day (20-
fold  human  exposure),  which  determined  of  the  rat  26  week  study.  In  addition  in  the  104  week 
carcinogenicity  study  in  rats,  increase  of  serum  estradiol  concentrations  in  females  but  not  males, 
increase  of  ovarian  cysts  at  all  dose  levels,  increase  of  mesovarian  ligament  smooth  muscle 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy  and  leiomyomata  at  ≥84.4/28.2  mcg/kg/day  have  been  observed.  The 
absence of these changes in males in the 26 week study suggests that GW642444 may be acting at a 
local  level  in  the  female  reproductive  tract  in  the  rat  rather  than  through  any  perturbation  of  the 
hypothalamic-pituitary axis.  
In mice, the incidence of development of ovarian cysts was increased at ≥62.0 mcg/kg/day, but not at 
6.40 mcg/kg/day at which AUC0-t was 30-fold the clinical exposure at the proposed commercial dose. 
In  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study  the  incidence  of  ovarian  cysts  was  increased  at  all  doses.  These 
ovarian  changes  are  considered  to  be  rodent-specific  and  are  of  no  relevance  to  humans  because  a 
similar beta2 related mechanism for cyst formation had not been identified over many patient years of 
clinical  use  with  other  beta2  agonists.  These  changes  were  not  seen  in  dogs  receiving  GW642444  at 
doses of up to 510 mcg/kg/day for 39 weeks. 
The benign neoplastic changes in the mammary glands (mammary adenoma; lobular hyperplasia with 
atypia)  of  rats  dosed  for  26  weeks  were  restricted  to  2/18  animals  at  2670  mcg/kg/day  where  the 
mean exposure was >1000 times higher than in humans at the proposed commercial dose. GW642444 
is not genotoxic and the NOAEL for this finding (537 mcg/kg/day) was 135 times greater than that in 
humans  at  the  proposed  commercial  dose  and  therefore  indicates  no  clinical  concern.  There  were  no 
GW642444-related  mammary  findings  in  the  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats  in  which  doses  up  to  657 
mcg/kg/day were administered for up to 104 weeks.

In relation to the toxicity of α-phenylcinnamate salt of GW642444, this salt showed similar significant 
safety  findings  to  the  triphenylacetate  salt  of  GW642444.  However,  there  were  safety  findings  seen 
only  with  the  triphenylacetate  salt  of  GW642444,  such  as  the  observed  changes  in  haematologic  and 
biochemistry  parameters.  The  comparison  of  toxicity  profile  of  both  salts  of  GW642444  could  have 
been clearer in one comparative study which includes the two salts. 
In relation to magnesium stearate toxicity alone, in repeat dose studies of up to 26 weeks duration in 
the  rat  and  4  weeks  duration  in  the dog  with  this  compound  has  demonstrated  little to  no  toxicity  of 
clinical  relevance.  Deposited  lung  doses  of  magnesium  stearate  at  the  NOAEL  in  rats  (1648 
mcg/kg/day  for  26  weeks)  or  dogs  (5820  mcg/kg/day  for  4  weeks)  were  210  or  1016-fold, 
respectively,  the  deposited  lung  dose  in  humans  given  an  inhaled  formulation  containing  130  mcg 
magnesium stearate.

Dawley rats (10/sex/group) by snout-only inhalation administration once daily for 60 minutes/day for 4 
weeks.  The  estimated  achieved  doses  of  GSK573719/GW642444  were  817/4.37,  1200/60.7, 
1060/1040,  757/0  and  0/869  mcg/kg/day.  Twelve  animals/sex  were  added  at  each  dose  for 
toxicokinetic evaluation which was performed on samples collected on Days 1, 14 and 28. 
There  was  one  unscheduled  death.  One  male  given  869  mcg/kg/day  GW642444  died  in  the  restraint 
tube  during  exposure  on Day  5.  This  death  was  considered to  be  as  a  result  of  the dosing procedure 
and not related to the test article. 
Test article-related histopathological findings of generally minimal and occasionally slight to moderate 
severity  were  seen  in  the  nasal  turbinates,  nasopharynx,  larynx  and  at  the  tracheal  bifurcation  in 
animals given GSK573719 alone or in combination with GW642444. Microscopic findings were seen in 
the  larynx  only  in  animals  given  GW642444  alone.  When  GSK573719  and  GW642444  were 
administered in combination, there was evidence of exacerbation of irritancy in these respiratory tract 
tissues.  
In  the  nasal  turbinates,  findings  included  minimal  or  slight  atrophy/disorganisation  of  the  olfactory 
epithelium  when  GSK573719  and  GW642444  were  given  in  combination  at  all combination  doses  but 
not when GSK573719 was given alone at 757 mcg/kg/day; minimal or slight atrophy of the olfactory 
nerve  fibres  when  GSK573719  and  GW642444  were  given  in  combination  at  all  doses  but  not  when 
GSK573719  was  given  alone  at  757  mcg/kg/day,  and  minimal  erosion  of  the  squamous  epithelium 
when  GSK573719  and  GW642444  were  given 
in  combination  doses 
in  one  male  given 
GSK573719/GW642444 at 1200/60.7 or 1060/1040 mcg/kg/day.  
GSK573719 alone at 757 mcg/kg/day (minimal severity); an increased severity when GSK573719 and 
GW642444  were  given  in  combination  at  all  doses  in  degeneration/regeneration  of  the  vomeronasal 
organ (minimal to slight severity) compared to the severity of response in animals given GSK573719 
alone  at  757  mcg/kg/day  (minimal  severity);  and  an  increased  incidence  of  minimal  squamous 
metaplasia  of  respiratory  and  olfactory  epithelium  of  the  vomeronasal  organ  in  females  given 
GSK573719/GW642444  at  1060/1040  mcg/kg/day  (3  females  affected)  compared  to  the  incidence  in 
females given GSK573719 alone at 757 mcg/kg/day (one female affected). 
In the nasopharynx, findings comprised minimal or slight degeneration of the respiratory epithelium in 
animals  given  GSK573719/GW642444  at  1060/1040  mcg/kg/day  and 
in  males  given 
GSK573719/GW642444  at  817/4.37  mcg/kg/day.  This  finding  was  not  seen  in  animals  given 
GSK573719 or GW642444 alone. 
In  the  larynx,  findings  included  minimal  epithelial  keratinisation  of  the  arytenoids  in  males  when 
GSK573719  and  GW642444  were  given  in  combination  at  1060/1040  mcg/kg/day  but  not  when 
GSK573719 was given alone at 757 mcg/kg/day.  
Body  weight gain  was  higher  in  the  animals  given GW642444  alone  at  869 mcg/kg/day (up  to  1.36X 
control)  and  lower  in  the  animals  given  GSK573719  alone  at  757  mcg/kg/day  (as  low  as  0.47X 
control). In the combination groups, higher or lower body weight reflected the relative contributions of 
each  test  article,  with  lower  body  weight  gain  in  animals  given  GSK573719/GW642444  at  817/4.37 
mcg/kg/day  (as  low  as  0.57X  control),  similar  body  weight  gain  to  controls  in  animals  given 
GSK573719/GW642444  at  1200/60.7  mcg/kg/day  and  higher  body  weight  gain  in  animals  given 
GSK573719/GW642444 at 1060/1040 mcg/kg/day (up to 1.40X control). There was no evidence of an 
exacerbation of effects when GSK573719 and GW642444 were given in combination.  
Red  cell  counts  were  higher  in  females  given  GSK573719/GW642444  at  all  combination  doses  (up  to 
1.08X control) or animals given GSK573719 at 757 mcg/kg/day. Mean cell haemoglobin and mean cell 
haemoglobin concentrations were lower in animals given GSK573719 at 757 mcg/kg/day or GW642444

at 869 mcg/kg/day (as low as 0.93X control). There was no evidence on exacerbation of effects when 
GSK573719 and GW642444 were given in combination. 
Alanine  aminotransferase  activity  was  higher  in  animals  given  GSK573719/GW642444  at  1060/1040 
mcg/kg/day  and  GW642444  alone  at  869  mcg/kg/day  (up  to  1.26X  control),  and  aspartate 
aminotransferase  activity  was  higher  in  animals  given  GSK573719/GW642444  at  1060/1040 
mcg/kg/day  (up  to  1.17X  control),  GSK573719  alone  at  757  mcg/kg/day  (up  to  1.24X  control)  and 
GW642444 alone at 869 mcg/kg/day (up to 1.33X control). There was no evidence of an exacerbation 
of effects when GSK573719 and GW642444 were given in combination. 
Dog 
4 week inhalation combination toxicity study (Report FD2009/00391) 
GSK573719  and  GW642444  (formulations  containing  0,  10  or  30%  w/w  GSK573719  and  0,  0.15  or 
10% w/w GW642444, and each blend contained 1% w/w magnesium stearate in lactose monohydrate) 
were given to beagle dogs (3/sex/group) by oroparyngeal administration once daily for 10 minutes/day 
for  4  weeks.  The  estimated  achieved  doses  of  GSK573719/GW642444  were  0/0,  996/6.46,  190/205, 
997/0,  0/174  mcg/kg/day.  Prior  to  dosing  in  the  4  week  phase,  Group  3  (GSK573719/GW642444, 
190/205)  and  Group  5  (0/174)  received  pre-treatment  for  3  days  (Phase  1,  tolerance  phase)  with 
42.0/48.7  mcg/kg/day  or  0/47.4  mcg/kg/day,  respectively,  to  induce  tachyphylaxis  of  potential 
cardiovascular  effects  anticipated  from  GW642444  (a  beta2  agonist)  dosing.  Toxicokinetic  evaluation 
was performed on samples collected on Days 1, 9 and 23. 
Swelling  of  the  neck,  observed  immediately  after  dosing,  and  dry  mouth  were  recorded  in  all  groups 
given  GSK573719  or  GW642444  alone  or  in  combination.  The  findings  were  seen  at  a  greater 
frequency  in  animals  given  GSK573719  at  a  target  dose  of  1000  mcg/kg/day,  more  so  alone  than  in 
combination  with  GW642444.  Decreased  tear  production  was  noted  in  animals  given  GSK573719, 
alone  or  in  combination  with  GW642444.  Generally,  there  were  no  apparent  differences  in  tear 
production  in  animals  given  GSK573719  alone  in  comparison  with  those  given  the  combination. 
Excessive salivation was observed during Phase 1 exposures in all males given GW642444 alone and in 
1/3 females given either GW642444 alone or in combination with GSK573719. This finding, which was 
observed more frequently in animals given GW642444 alone, subsided by the completion of dosing. 
During  Phase  1,  increased  femoral  pulse  rates  (up  to  1.96X  pre-dose)  were  seen  commencing 
immediately after the completion of dosing in animals given GW642444, alone or in combination. Pulse 
rates generally peaked between 0.5 and 1 to 2 hours post dose, with a return to baseline between 8 
and 23 hours 50 minutes post dose. Beyond Day 1 (Phase 1), the magnitude of the effect diminished 
in  both  sexes,  with  no  effect  evident  on  Day  3  (Phase  1),  with  the  exception  of  an  increase  at  10 
minutes after dosing. During Phase 2, increased femoral pulse rates (up to 2.22X pre-dose) were seen 
commencing immediately after the completion of dosing in animals given GSK573719 and GW642444, 
alone  or  in  combination.  There  were  no  apparent  differences  between  animals  given  the  combination 
and those given GSK573719 or GW642444 alone.  
Minimal to mild increases in serum cTnI were observed on the first day of dosing in Phase 1 and Phase 
2  in  all  groups  given  GSK573719  or  GW642444,  alone  or  in  combination.  On  both  occasions,  the 
greatest  increases  were  noted  between  4  and  8  hours  after  the  completion  of  dosing.  Throughout 
Phase 2, the most consistent changes were seen in animals given GW642444 alone (2/3 males and 1/3 
female), although the number of animals affected was generally similar in all groups given GSK573719 
or GW642444, alone or in combination. Partial to near recovery was noted 24 hours after dosing for all 
affected  animals.  A  return  to  baseline  levels  was  evident  for  all  animals  on  Day  23.  Changes  in  cTnI 
seen  in  animals  given  GW642444  alone  at  174  mcg/kg/day  or  GSK573719  alone  at  997  mcg/kg/day 
were not exacerbated in animals given the test articles in combination.

Focal fibrosis associated with mineral deposition was seen in the cardiac papillary muscle in one female 
given  GSK573719/GW642444  at  190/205  mcg/kg/day  and  correlated  with  the  increases  in  femoral 
pulse rate and serum cTnI seen in this animal on Day 1 of Phase 1 (up to 142X pre-dose) and Day 1 of 
Phase 2 (up to 5.6X pre-dose). 
An  increase  in  the  severity  of  thymic  involution/atrophy  (slight  to  severe)  was  seen  in  animals  given 
GSK573719  and  GW642444,  alone  or  in  combination,  when  compared  to  controls.  However,  the 
incidence and severity of this finding was generally similar across groups given either test article, alone 
or  in  combination.  This  finding  correlated  with  slight  to  moderately  small  thymus  noted  in  some 
animals  given  GSK573719,  alone  or  in  combination  with  GW642444.  Furthermore,  in  animals  given 
GSK573719/GW642444  at  190/205  mcg/kg/day,  lower  thymus  weight  was  seen  (0.56X  controls  in 
males and 0.65X controls in females). 
Group  mean  body  weight  gains  were  slightly  greater  in  animals  given  GSK573719/GW642444  at 
190/205 mcg/kg/day or GW642444 alone at 174 mcg/kg/day (+0.6 to 1.1 kg) compared to controls (-
0.2 kg). 
There  was  no  notable  difference  in  systemic  exposure  for  GSK573719  and  GW642444  when 
administered alone or in combination. 
4 week inhalation combination toxicity study (Report 2010N109790) 
GSK573719  and  GW642444  (formulations  containing  0  15%  w/w  GSK573719  and  15%  w/w 
GW642444,  and  each  blend  contained  1%  w/w  magnesium  stearate  in  lactose  monohydrate)  were 
given to beagle dogs (3/sex/group) by oroparyngeal administration once daily for 10 minutes/day for 4 
weeks.  The  estimated  achieved  doses  of  GSK573719/GW642444  were  189/201  and  188/199 
mcg/kg/day. Prior to dosing in the 4 week phase, Group 2 (GSK573719/GW642444, 189/201) received 
42/47 mcg/kg/day of GSK573719/GW642444 for 3 days (tolerance phase) to induce tachyphylaxis of 
potential cardiovascular effects anticipated from GW642444 (a beta2 agonist) dosing. The other group 
(Group 3) was not dosed in Phase 1. As GW642444 at a target dose of 160 mcg/kg/day had not been 
given  to  dogs  without  previously  undergoing  a  3  day  tolerance  phase,  one  animal  per  sex  per  group 
was  given  doses  of  160/160  mcg/kg/day  of  GSK573719/GW642444  for  3  days  without  previously 
undergoing a tolerance phase (prior to commencement of dosing of Group 3). Toxicokinetic evaluation 
was performed on samples collected on Day 1 and during Week 4. 
Inhalation  exposure  of  dogs  to  the  combination  of  GSK573719  and  GW642444  at  189/201  (Group  2, 
with  tolerance  phase)  and  188/199  mcg/kg/day  (Group  3,  without  a  tolerance  phase)  resulted  in 
increased heart rate (HR) up to 3.4X and 3.7X pre-dose, respectively, decreased heart rate variability 
(HRV),  ventricular  arrhythmias  and  increase  in  cTnI.  On  Days  1  and  2  of  Phase  2,  although  the 
changes  to  HR  and  HRV  were  generally  comparable  between  animals  in  both  groups,  the  duration  of 
the  effects  were  more  prolonged  in  animals  that  did  not  undergo  the  tolerance  phase  (Group  3). 
Changes in HR and HRV were accompanied by occasions of ventricular arrhythmia after the first dose 
in  one  animal  that  did  not  undergo  the  tolerance  phase  (Group  3),  however,  there  were  fewer 
ventricular premature contractions on Day 2 and no such events thereafter in this dog. The differences 
in cardiovascular parameters were marginal across the groups by Day 14 and during Week 4. 
As expected, femoral pulse rates increased in Group 2 (with tolerance phase, up to 2.0X pre-dose) and 
Group  3  (without  tolerance  phase,  up  to  2.3X  pre-dose),  the  magnitude  of  which  was  generally 
comparable across both groups and diminished with repeated dosing. 
Group  3  animals  (without  tolerance  phase)  demonstrated  minimally  to  moderately  increased  serum 
cTnI concentrations (up to 4.41 mcg/L; 735X baseline) on Day 1 and were mildly to moderately higher 
(up  to  3.5X  peak  elevation  at  8  hours)  than  those  animals  previously  exposed  during  the  tolerance 
phase (Group 2; up to 3.5X peak elevation at 8 hours). The administration of GSK573719/GW642444

in  this  tolerance  phase  was  therefore  considered  to  provide  partial  tolerance  (tachyphylaxis)  to  the 
higher  dose  given  in  Phase  2,  particularly  in  the  females.  Partial  recovery  of  affected  males  and 
complete recovery of affected females was apparent at 23 hours 50 minutes after completion of dosing 
on  both  Day  1  of  Phase  1  for  Group  2  (with  tolerance  phase)  and  Day  1  of  Phase  2  for  Group  3 
(without tolerance phase), with a return to baseline levels at all time points in the previously affected 
animals evident on Day 27 (with the exception of Group 3 female whose serum cTnI levels remained 
minimally  but  consistently  higher  than  baseline).  The  pattern  of  cTnI  elevation  suggests  that  these 
increases  are  linked  to  release  of  cTnI  from  myocardium,  correlated  with  the  marked  and  sustained 
increases in HR as observed on Day 1. 
Swelling  of  the  neck,  observed  during  and  immediately  after  dosing,  dry  mouth  and  decreased  tear 
production were recorded in both groups given the combination (swelling of the neck was also seen in 
control animals to a lesser extent). Overall, the frequency, incidence and/or severity of these findings, 
as appropriate, were greater in animals in Group 3 (without tolerance phase). Excessive salivation was 
also observed during and immediately after exposure in both groups given the combination. During the 
tolerance phase, lacrimation was also occasionally noted after dosing in animals given the combination. 
During  Phase  2,  mydriasis  was  seen  after  dosing,  albeit  infrequently,  in  Group  2  animals  (with 
tolerance  phase).  These  clinical  observations  have  been  observed  previously  in  studies  with 
GSK573719 and are considered due to pharmacology and/or the dosing procedure. 
Slightly increased body weights (up to 1.09X pre-test), when compared to controls, were recorded in 
Group 2 animals (with tolerance phase). 
Minimal increases in serum potassium (up to 1.20X pre-test), creatinine (up to 1.25X pre-test), blood 
urea nitrogen (up to 1.64X pre-test) were seen and the changes were generally similar in both groups 
given the combination. A minimal decrease in chloride (0.95X pre-test) was noted in Group 3 females 
(without tolerance phase). 
Absolute  and  relative  heart  weights  were  slightly  lower  (as  low  as  0.79X)  than  controls  in  Group  2 
animals  that  were  subjected  to  the  3  day  tolerance  phase.  There  was  no  evidence  of  any  associated 
morphologic changes in the heart even with the use of Masson’s trichrome stain. 
There was generally no consistent difference in systemic exposure (as measured by AUC0-t and Cmax) 
to  GSK573719  or  GW642444  when  administered  with  or  without  the  3  day  tolerance  dosing  phase. 
Variability  in  systemic  exposure  to  GSK573719  and GW642444  between  individual  dogs  receiving  the 
same  dosage  was  observed  across  all  the  studies  in  which  GSK573719  and/or  GW642444  were 
administered alone or in combination by the oropharyngeal route. During Week 4, GSK573719 AUC0-t 
values  were  17.3  and  18.6  ng.h/mL  in  males  and  9.26  and  13.9  ng.h/mL  in  females,  respectively,  in 
both  dose  groups.  For  GW642444,  AUC0-t  values  were  264  and  130  ng.h/mL  in  males  and  84.4  and 
187 ng.h/mL in females, respectively, in both dose groups. 
13 week inhalation combination toxicity study (Report WD201006677) 
GSK573719 and GW642444 (formulations containing 0, 3, 15 or 40% w/w GSK573719 and 0, 0.2, 3 or 
15% w/w GW642444, and each blend contained 1% w/w magnesium stearate in lactose monohydrate) 
were given to beagle dogs (4/sex/group) by oroparyngeal administration once daily for 10 minutes/day 
for  13  weeks.  The  estimated  achieved  doses  of  GSK573719/GW642444  were  0/0,  1070/7.5,  23/29, 
60/72,  177/183,  1048/0  and  0/180  mcg/kg/day.  Prior  to  dosing  in  the  13  week  phase,  Group  5 
(GSK573719/GW642444, 177/183) and Group 7 (0/180) received pre-treatment for 3 days (Phase 1, 
tolerance phase) with 44/47 mcg/kg/day or 0/49 mcg/kg/day, respectively, to induce tachyphylaxis of 
potential  cardiovascular  effects  anticipated  from  GW642444  (a  beta2  agonist)  dosing.  Toxicokinetic 
evaluation was performed on samples collected in Weeks 4, 8 and 13.

Swelling of the neck, observed during and immediately after dosing, was recorded in all groups given 
GSK573719  or  GW642444,  alone  or  in  combination.  Decreased  tear  production  was  noted  in  animals 
given GSK573719, alone or in combination with GW642444. Neck swelling and reduced tear production 
were seen at a greater frequency and severity in animals given GSK573719 at a target dose of 1000 
mcg/kg/day, more so alone than in combination with GW642444. 
During  Phase  1,  increased  femoral  pulse  rates  (up  to  2.18X  pre-dose)  were  seen  commencing 
immediately after the completion of dosing in animals given GW642444, alone or in combination with 
GSK573719. Pulse rates generally peaked within 1 hour after the completion of dosing, with a return to 
baseline between 4 and 23 hours 50 minutes post dose. During Phase 2, increased femoral pulse rates 
(up to 2.23X pre-dose) were seen commencing immediately after the completion of dosing in animals 
given  GW642444  alone  or  in  combination  with  GSK573719.  The  greatest  effect  on  pulse  rates  was 
seen  in  animals  given  GSK573719/GW642444  at  177/183  mcg/kg/day.  The  effect  on  pulse  rates 
diminished (tachyphylaxis) over the duration of the study in both sexes given either test article, alone 
or  in  combination.  ECG  measurements  taken  immediately  following  exposure  during  Week  13 
confirmed increased heart rates (HR) in all affected groups. In contrast with pre-test, where all animals 
showed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), RSA was not observed pre- or post dose during Week 13 
in  animals  given  GSK573719  at  a  target  dose  of  1000  mcg/kg/day,  alone  or  in  combination  with 
GW642444. 
The measured serum cTnI can provide indication of onset of tolerance (tachyphylaxis) to animals given 
GW642444 alone or in combination with GSK573719 during Phases 1 and 2. Evidence of tachyphylaxis 
was  noted  in  2  males  given  GW642444  at  49  then  180  mcg/kg/day  during  Phase  1  then  2, 
respectively, as demonstrated by increases in serum cTnI concentration during Phase 1, but no further 
response during Phase 2. However, one male who did not demonstrate an increase during Phase 1 did 
show  an  increase  in  cTnI  concentration  during  Phase  2.  All  males  remained  virtually  unresponsive 
when  given  GSK573719  and  GW642444  in  combination  during  Phase  1  and  2.  Evidence  of 
tachyphylaxis  seen  in  the  females  given  GSK573719  and  GW642444  at  44/47  mcg/kg/day  during 
Phase 1 followed by 177/183 mcg/kg/day during Phase 2 as demonstrated by all 4 animals showing an 
increase in cTnI during Phase 1 but only one animal showing an increase in Phase 2. When GW642444 
alone at 49 then 180 mcg/kg/day was administered to females, 2/4 showed an increase in cTnI during 
Phase 1 but 3 showed an increase during Phase 2 showing tachyphylaxis had not developed. More so 
than  the  males,  the  females  appeared  to  be  more  sensitive  to  administration  of  GSK573719  in 
combination  with  GW642444.  This  was  evidenced  by  the  increased  cTnI  levels  in  females  given 
GSK573719  and  GW642444  at  23/29  mcg/kg/day,  effects  which  were  not  seen  in  concurrent  males. 
The  increases  in  serum  cTnI  noted  in  this  study  were  considered  to  reflect  minimal  to  mild 
cardiomyocyte injury, a result of the pharmacology of the test articles. 
Increased  severity  and  incidence  of  mixed  inflammatory  cell  infiltrates  in  the  laryngeal  mucosa  was 
observed  microscopically  in  males  given  GSK573719/GW642444  at  1070/7.5 mcg/kg/day  or  177/183 
mcg/kg/day, and in females given GSK573719 alone at 1040 mcg/kg/day. This change is indicative of 
a minor irritant effect of treatment. 
Subacute  to  chronic 
inflammation  of  the 
lungs  was  observed 
in  1  of  4  males  given 
GSK573719/GW642444 at 1070/7.5 mcg/kg/day. This change is considered to be secondary to inhaled 
exogenous  material  in  this  animal  in  which  the  mucociliary  defence  mechanism  might  have  been 
compromised by the antimuscarinic effect of GSK573719. 
Group mean body weight gains were slightly greater in animals given GW642444 at ≥7.5 mcg/kg/day 
(1.1 to 2.6 kg), alone or in combination with GSK573719, when compared to controls (0.7 to 0.8 kg). 
In females, this correlated with an increase in food consumption.

Transient  increases  in  serum  potassium  (up  to  1.21X  pre-test  at  Week  4)  and  in  phosphorus  (males 
only;  up  to  1.19X  at  Week  4)  were  seen  in  animals  given  GW642444,  alone  or  in  combination  with 
GSK573719.  Increases  in  glutamate  dehydrogenase  (up  to  1.51X  controls  at Week  13)  and  in  serum 
blood  urea  nitrogen  levels  (up  to  1.71X)  were  also  seen  in  animals  given  GSK573719  or  GW642444, 
alone or in combination. 
Generally, there were minor differences in the magnitude of change between groups given GSK573719 
or GW642444 alone and those given the test articles in combination. Decreased prostate weights were 
seen  in  males  given  GSK573719/GW642444  at  177/183  and  0/180  mcg/kg/day.  Reductions  in  heart 
and thymus weights were noted in females given GSK573719 or GW642444, alone or in combination. 
The  NOAEL  for  the  1:1  ratio  GSK573719/GW642444  combination  is  considered  to  be  177/183 
mcg/kg/day  GSK573719/GW642444.  These  doses  correspond  to  mean  DNAUCs  of  9.71/192  ng.h/mL 
and  DNCmax  of  6.20/86.8  ng/mL  for  GSK573719  and  GW642444,  respectively  (males  and  females 
combined).  There  was  no  notable  difference  in  systemic  exposure  for  GSK573719  and  GW642444 
when administered alone or in combination.

GSK573719 showed no genotoxic potential in the standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests.  
An assessment of the route of synthesis for GSK573719 (as the bromide salt) has been conducted to 
determine  whether  any  impurities  might  be  present  which  are  known  or  suspected  DNA-reactive 
mutagens,  and  to  assess  the  likelihood  of  any  such  impurities  being  present  in  final  drug  product. 
There  were  no  impurities  of  mutagenic  concern  at  a  level  that  would  exceed  the  threshold  of 
toxicological concern (TTC) as defined by guidelines on the limits for genotoxic impurities.

GW642444 produced no evidence of

hours apart. 
GW642444 did not induce UDS in

GI179710X was shown to be non-
mutagenic in the absence and 
presence of an in vitro metabolic 
activation system (rat liver S9-mix). 
GI179710X is non-mutagenic in the 
mouse lymphoma test system in the 
absence and presence of an in vitro 
metabolic activation system (rat 
liver S9-mix). 
GW642444  (as  the  α-phenyl  cinnamate  salt)  was  not  mutagenic  in  a  bacterial  mutagenicity  assay  at 
concentrations up to ≥1500 mcg/plate, as well as  did not induce morphological transformation in the 
Syrian hamster embryo cell transformation assay up to 32.5 mcg/mL (limited by cytotoxicity) and was 
not  genotoxic  in  vivo  in  either  the  rat  micronucleus  assay  or  the  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis  assay 
using  rat  hepatocytes  at  maximum  tolerated  intravenous  doses  that  produced  plasma  concentrations 
>20000  times  (Cmax)  higher  than  those  seen  in  humans.  However,  although  GW642444  (as  the  α-
phenyl cinnamate salt) was not genotoxic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of S9-
mix at concentrations up to 30 and 8 mcg/mL, GW642444 (as the α-phenyl cinnamate salt) did induce 
an  equivocal,  non-reproducible  response  in  the  presence  of  S9-mix  at  highly cytotoxic  concentrations 
(≤20% Relative Total Growth). The weight of evidence from the all data indicates that GW642444 (as 
the  α-phenyl  cinnamate  salt)  does  not  represent  a  genotoxic  hazard  to  humans.  On  the  other  hand, 
GI179710 did  not  cause  gene  mutation  in  a  bacterial  mutagenicity  test  or  chromosomal  damage  in  a 
mammalian in vitro assay. The concentrations of GI179710 tested alone represent considerably higher 
levels  than  would  have  been  achieved  if  tested  as  part  of  GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt). 
Since  both  GW642444  (parent)  and  GI179710  (triphenylacetic  acid)  were  not  genotoxic,  it  is 
acceptable  that  the  commercial  compound  GW642444M  (the  triphenylacetate  salt  of  GW642444)  is 
considered not to represent a genotoxic hazard to humans.

Carcinogenicity 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
Mouse carcinogenicity study (Report 2012N1316646) 
The  carcinogenic  potential  of  GSK573719  was  assessed  in  a  2  year  inhalation  repeat  dose  study  in 
which groups of CD-1 mice (75/sex/group) were administered estimated achieved doses of, for males, 
0 (vehicle), 58.6, 188 or 533 mcg/kg/day once daily (60 minutes/day) for Weeks 1 to 66 and then 0 
(vehicle),  32.2,  102  or  295  mcg/kg/day  once  daily  (30  minutes/day)  from  Week  67  onward;  and  for 
females,  0  (vehicle),  20.8,  63.7  or  200  mcg/kg/day  once  daily  (60  minutes/day)  throughout.  Fifteen 
animals/sex  were  added  to  the  vehicle  control  group  and  45  animals/sex  were  added  to  each  of  the 
treated  groups  for  toxicokinetic  evaluation  in  Weeks  4  and  26  at  the  initial  doses  (60  minutes 
exposure/day).  An  additional  9  males  were  added  to  the  vehicle  control  group  and  24  males  were 
added  to  each  of  the  treated  groups  for  toxicokinetic  evaluation  following  4  weeks  of  dosing  at  the 
reduced doses (30 minutes exposure/day). 
There were no adverse effects of GSK573719 on survival of male or female mice. At the end of Week 
104 the number of animals surviving was 53, 40, 44 and 53 in males given 0, 58.6/32. 2, 188/102 and 
533/295  mcg/kg/day,  respectively,  and  40,  59,  39  and  45  in  females  given  0,  20.8,  63.7  and  200 
mcg/kg/day, respectively. There were no GSK573719-related neoplastic changes. 
Body  weight  gain  was  lower  than  controls  in  all  male  groups  given  GSK573719  over  Weeks  0  to  66 
(0.93X,  0.97X  and  0.76X  control  in  males  given  58.6,  188  and  533  mcg/kg/day,  respectively);  there 
may  be  some  evidence  of  recovery  following  the  lowering  of  the  dose  levels.  Food  consumption  was 
lower in Week 1 in all male treated groups (0.85X, 0.85X and 0.87X control in males given 58.6, 188 
and  533  mcg/kg/day,  respectively),  and  retained  lower  throughout  in  males  given  533/295 
mcg/kg/day (0.94X control). 
An increase in incidence but not severity of bilateral posterior lens opacity in Week 103 for males (9, 
12, 15 and 27 affected in males given 0, 58.6/32.2, 188/102 and 533/295 mcg/kg/day, respectively) 
and females given 20.8 or 200 mcg/kg/day (35 and 27 females affected, respectively, compared to 16 
in  the  control  group)  was  considered  unlikely  to  be  related  to  treatment  as  the  incidence  was  within 
background ranges for males and showed no dose relationship for females, and showed no correlating 
histopathological lesions. 
GSK573719 systemic exposure (DNAUC0-t) to male mice based on combined values from Weeks 4 and 
26 were 4.15, 1.64 and 12.2 ng.h/mL at 58.6, 188 and 533 mcg/kg/day, respectively (data only from 
Week  4  at  58.6  mcg/kg/day).  GSK573719  systemic  exposure  (DNAUC0-t)  to  female  mice  based  on 
combined values from Weeks 4 and 26 were 1.01, 4.31 and 8.26 at 20.8, 63.7 and 200 mcg/kg/day, 
respectively (data only from Week 4 at 20.8 mcg/kg/day). GSK573719 systemic exposure (DNAUC0-t) 
to male mice at Week 76 (4 weeks at revised doses) were 1.53, 3.28 and 8.21 ng.h/mL at 32.2, 102 
and 295 mcg/kg/day, respectively. 
Rat carcinogenicity study (2012N121619) 
GSK573719  was  given  to  Sprague  Dawley  rats  (65/sex/group)  by  snout-only  inhalation  at  estimated 
achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 30.1, 101 or 276 mcg/kg/day once daily (60 minutes/day) for Weeks 1 
to 72 and then 0 (vehicle), 14.7, 45.0 or 137 mcg/kg/day once daily (30 minutes/day) from Week 73 
to  104  owing  to  significant  dose  related  decreases  in  body  weight.  Nine  animals/sex  were  added  at

each dose level and to the control group for toxicokinetic evaluations. An additional 9 animals/sex were 
added to each group for toxicokinetic evaluation following 4 weeks of dosing at the lower doses. 
There  were  no  adverse  effects  of  GSK573719  on  survival  of  male  or  female  rats.  Increased  survival 
was  noted  for  males  and  females given  276/137  mcg/kg/day  over the  104  weeks  of  treatment  (72% 
and 62% survival for males and females, respectively, compared with 58% and 38% for control males 
and females, respectively). 
During Weeks 0 to 72, there was a statistically significant, dose-related decrease in body weight gain 
in males and females at all dose levels ≥30.1 mcg/kg/day (down to 0.84X control and 0.75X control at 
276  mcg/kg/day  for  males  and  females,  respectively).  This  was  accompanied  by  a  minimal 
(statistically significant in females in all treated groups) reduction in food consumption (down to 0.97X 
and 0.94X at 276 mcg/kg/day in males and females, respectively, over Weeks 1 to 72). As a result of 
the reduction in body weight gain, the dose levels were reduced in all treated groups from Week 73. In 
males, the dose reduction prevented any further reduction in body weight gain such that by the end of 
the study, the overall reduction in body weight gain remained similar to that at Weeks 0 to 72 (0.84X 
control for males at 276/137 mcg/kg/day). In females, the dose reduction had a positive influence on 
body  weight  gain  such  that  by  the  end  of  the  study,  the  overall  reduction  in  body  weight  gain  had 
improved  for  doses  of  30.1/14.7  and  101/45.0  mcg/kg/day  (up  to  0.92X  control)  and  had  prevented 
any further reduction in body weight gain at 276/137 mcg/kg/day (0.78X control). Food consumption 
remained  consistent  such  that  by  the  end  of  the  study,  there  remained  a  minimal  (statistically 
significant)  reduction  over  Weeks  1  to  104  (0.97X  control  and  0.94X  control  for  males  and  females, 
respectively, at 276/137 mcg/kg/day). 
A  higher  incidence  and  severity  of  increased  eosinophilic  inclusions  in  the  olfactory  epithelium  in  the 
nasal turbinates were seen in males and females given 276/137 mcg/kg/day. 
There  were  no  GSK573719-related  neoplastic  changes.  The  following  neoplastic  lesions  were 
statistically significant in one test (but not in others): benign granular cell tumour in the brain in males 
and benign basal cell tumour in the skin in females. These tumours although statistically significant in 
some  tests  were  considered  not  to  be  related  to  treatment  with  GSK573719.  The  range  and 
distribution  of  neoplastic  lesions  seen  in  this  study  was  considered  to  be  similar  to  those  seen 
previously in this strain of rat in this laboratory. 
GSK573719 systemic exposure (DNAUC0-t) to male rats based on combined values from Weeks 4 and 
26 were 3.25 and 13.5 ng.h/mL at 101 and 276 mcg/kg/day, respectively (insufficient data to define 
AUC  at  30.1  mcg/kg/day).  GSK573719  systemic  exposure  (DNAUC0-t)  to  female  rats  based  on 
combined  values  from  Weeks  4  and  26  were  0.451,  84  and  13.5  ng.h/mL  at  30.1,  101  and  276 
mcg/kg/day, respectively. 
GSK573719 systemic exposure (DNAUC0-t) to male rats at Week 76 (4 weeks at revised doses) were 
0.921, 2.10 and 6.26 ng.h/mL at 14.7, 45.0 and 137 mcg/kg/day, respectively. GSK573719 systemic 
exposure (DNAUC0-t) to female rats at Week 76 (4 weeks at revised doses) were 0.353, 2.09 and 7.23 
ng.h/mL at 14.7, 45.0 and 137 mcg/kg/day, respectively. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Mouse carcinogenicity study 
The carcinogenic potential of GW64244 was assessed in a 2 year inhalation repeat dose study in which 
groups of mice (60/sex/group) were administered estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle, 2 groups), 
1.0,  3.2,  8.6  mcg/kg/day  in  lactose  once  daily  (1  hour/day).    The  original  design  required  60  main 
study  animals/sex/group  and  66  toxicokinetic  animals/sex/group.  Due  to  the  high  mortality  that 
occurred  across  all  groups  during  the  first  few  months  of  the  study,  when  compared  with  historical 
control  data,  24  toxicokinetic  animals/sex/group  were  reassigned  as  main  study  animals;  these

animals had not previously been subject to any blood sampling. All data related to these animals have 
been  combined  with  the  main  study  animals  and  is  reported  together.  The  total  group  size  was 
therefore 84 animals/sex/group in the main study and 42 animals/sex/group in the toxicokinetic study. 
High  mortality  occurred  across  all  groups  when  compared  with  historical  control  data  due  to  swollen 
abdomen which was believed to be associated with the design of the restraint tube, possibly leading to 
air  swallowing.    As  a  result  the  tube  end  caps  were  changed  on  several  occasions  during  the  study, 
following  which  there  was  a  marked  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  swollen  abdomen.    Despite  these 
mortalities, a sufficient number of animals survived to the end of the study to assess the carcinogenic 
potential of GW642444. 
The most common cause of death in both sexes was gaseous distension of the GIT (see above). Other 
common  causes  of  death  included  lymphoreticular  neoplasms  (both  sexes),  urogenital  tract 
infection/obstruction  (primarily  in  males)  and  skin  ulceration/infection,  including  pododermatitis  and 
tail  infection  (both  sexes).  All  conditions  occurred  in  control  and  treated  groups,  and  showed  no 
evidence of a dose-response or clear association with GW642444 administration.  
Administration  of  GW642444  was  associated  with  test  article-related  neoplastic  and  non-neoplastic 
proliferative changes in the ovaries and uterus and non-neoplastic changes in the ovaries, uterus and 
vagina  of  females  and  in  the  nasal  cavity  of  both  sexes.  In  the  ovary,  an  increased  incidence  of  sex 
cord  stromal  hypertrophy/hyperplasia  was  seen  at  all  doses  and  an  increased  incidence  of 
tubulostromal hyperplasia, sex cord tumors and ovarian cysts (and ovarian compression due to cysts) 
at  ≥62  mcg/kg/day.  An  increased  incidence  of  tubulostromal  adenomas  was  seen  at  29500 
mcg/kg/day. In the uterus, an increased incidence and severity of cystic endometrial hyperplasia was 
seen  at  all  doses,  accompanied  by  endometrial  glandular  squamous  metaplasia  in  a  few  females  at 
6150  or  29500  mcg/kg/day.  Myometrial  hypertrophy/hyperplasia  and  an  increased  incidence  of 
leiomyoma  and/or  leiomyosarcoma  were  seen  at  ≥62  mcg/kg/day.  In  the  vagina,  a  slight  increased 
incidence of anestrus appearance (with/without mucin) was seen in at all doses. In the nasal cavity, an 
increased incidence and/or severity of luminal inflammatory cells/cell debris was seen in females at all 
doses  and  olfactory  degenerative  changes  were  seen  in  both  sexes  at  ≥62  mcg/kg/day.  The  findings 
were minimal or slight in severity at doses up to 615 mcg/kg/day, but were more notably increased in 
incidence and severity in both sexes given ≥6150 mcg/kg/day. 
GW642444  systemic  exposure  (AUC0-t)  to  male  and  female  mice  based  on  combined  values  from 
Weeks  4  and  26  were  7.93,  34.9,  135,  920  and  3591  ng.h/mL  at  6.4,  62,  615,  6150  or  29500 
mcg/kg/day,  respectively.  Following  treatment  with  GW642666  systemic  exposure  was  also 
demonstrated  to  GI17910  (counterion)  and  GSK932009  and  GW630200  (the  major  human 
metabolites). 
Rat carcinogenicity study 
GW642444 was given to Sprague Dawley rats (60/sex/group) at estimated achieved doses of 0, 10.5, 
84.4, 223 and 657 mcg/kg/day for 60 minutes once daily for 85 weeks by nose-only inhalation. Due to 
increased  mortality  dosing  was  stopped  for  females  given  223  and  657  mcg/kg/day  at  Week  85  (26 
and  23  animals  surviving  in  these  groups,  respectively).  These  females  remained  on  study  without 
further treatment until group survival fell to 15 (Weeks 95 or 96, respectively) at which time they were 
electively killed. The doses of the remaining females were reduced from Week 86 to 3.47 (from 10.5) 
and 28.2 (from 84.4) mcg/kg/day by decreasing the daily exposure duration from 60 to 20 minutes for 
the  remainder  of  the  study.  Females  at  84.4/28.2  mcg/kg/day  were  terminated  in  Week  95  due  to 
survival  reaching  15.  Control  females  and  females  given  10.5/3.47  mcg/kg/day  were  killed  in  Week 
104.  All  males  were  electively  killed  in  Week  101  when  the  number  of  survivors  in  the  control  group 
fell to less than 20. 
Early mortality associated with pituitary neoplasms was observed in male rats given ≥223 mcg/kg/day 
GW642444 and females given ≥84.4/28.2 mcg/kg/day. In both sexes this finding was proposed to be 
the  result  of  pharmacologically-mediated  increased body  weight  gain  in  the  early  stages  of  the  study 
and  increased  food  consumption.  In  females  hormonal  imbalance  resulting  from  pharmacologically-

mediated,  dose  related,  increase  incidence  and  severity  (size)  of  ovarian  follicular  cysts  may  have 
contributed to the reduced latency of the pituitary findings. 
An  increased  incidence  of  mesovarian  smooth  muscle  hyperplasia/hypertrophy  and  of  mesovarian 
leiomyomata  was  seen  in  females  given  ≥84.4/28.2  mcg/kg/day.  The  findings  were  present  in 
decedent females and those surviving to terminal kill and are considered a consequence of prolonged 
β2-adrenergic stimulation.   
GW642444 systemic exposure (AUC0-t) to male rats based on combined values from Weeks 4 and 26 
were  0.420,  8.52,  16.9  and  51.8  ng.h/mL  at  10.5,  84.4,  223  and  657  mcg/kg/day,  respectively. 
GW642444  systemic  exposure  (AUC0-t)  to  female  rats  based  on  combined  values  from  Weeks  4  and 
26  and  extrapolating  to  lowered  doses  were  0.215/0.0711,  9.72/3.25,  18.7  and  55.7  ng.h/mL  at 
10.5/3.47,  84.4/28.2,  223  and  657  mcg/kg/day,  respectively.  Following  treatment  with  GW642444, 
systemic exposure was also demonstrated to GI17910 (counterion) and the major human metabolites 
(GSK932009 and GW630200). 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
The  fixed  dose  combination  of  umeclidinium  bromide/vilanterol  contains  two  compounds  assessed  as 
non  carcinogenic.  The  carcinogenic  potential  is  thus  fully  assessed.  Hence  other  studies  assessing 
carcinogenic potential with the combination are not needed in accordance with the requirements of the 
“Guideline  on  the  Non-Clinical  Development  of  Fixed  Combinations  of  Medicinal  Products 
“(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
Male fertility (Report CD2010/00187) 
GSK573719 was administered subcutaneously to male Sprague Dawley rats (25/group) at dose levels 
of 30, 60 or 180 mcg/kg/day once daily for 49 to 53 days. After 14 days of treatment, males were co-
habited 1:1 with untreated females. Mated females were separated from the males and considered to 
be on Day 0 pc. Mated females and their litters were euthanized on Day 20 pc. 
There were no GW573719-related deaths or clinical observations. Statistically significant decreases in 
body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption  were  seen  intermittently  in  the  high  dose  group  throughout 
the study. A statistically significant decrease in food consumption was also seen between Study Days 
36 to 43 in the 30 mcg/kg/day group. 
There was no effect on days needed for mating (2.0 to 3.3 days), mating incidence (100%), pregnancy 
incidence  (96%  to  100%)  or  organ  weights  at  any  dose.  There  was  no  GSK573719-related  effect  on 
mean  numbers  of  corpora  lutea,  implantations,  resorptions,  pre-implantation  loss,  post-implantation 
loss,  total  live  fetuses,  percent  live  males,  placental  morphology  or  on  uterus  weight  at  any  dose 
tested.  There  was  no  GSK573719-related  effect  on  fetal  body  weight  at  any  dose.  There  were  no 
GSK573719-related  fetal  malformations  or  variations  at  any  dose.  Therefore,  the  NOAEL  for  mating, 
fertility and gonadal function in male rats was 180 mcg/kg/day. 
Toxicokinetic data from the 14 day subcutaneous toxicokinetic and tolerability study in male rats shows 
that  systemic  exposure  achieved  at  the  NOAEL  was  31.1  ng.h/mL  and  31.4  ng/mL  for  AUC  and  Cmax 
(Day 14), respectively

GSK573719 (3.37, 29.1, 100 or 294 mcg/kg/day) was administered by snout-only inhalation to female 
Sprague  Dawley  rats  (25/group)  (Report  WD2007/00763).  Females  were  treated  daily  for  2  weeks 
before  pairing,  throughout  pairing  and  until  Day  7  after  mating.  Mated  females  and  their  litters  were 
euthanized on Day 20 post coitum (pc). 
There were 3 deaths during the pre-mating period, none of which was considered GSK573719-related. 
One  female  given  29.1  mcg/kg/day  collapsed  and  died  following  smearing  on  Day  15.  Two  females, 
one each at 100 and 294 mcg/kg/day, died during exposure (related to the dosing procedure). 
There  were  no  adverse  effects  on  body  weight,  food  consumption,  clinical  signs  or  macroscopic 
necropsy  findings.  Mating  performance  (assessed  on  the  basis  of  regularity  of  estrous  cycles),  pre-
coital  interval  or  fertility  were  unaffected  by  treatment.  There  were  no  adverse  effects  on  gravid 
uterus,  litter  or  fetal  weights.  A  slightly  higher  mean  fetal  weight  (1.06X  control)  at 294  mcg/kg/day 
was considered not adverse in the absence of any other changes. 
Based  on  these  findings,  the  NOAEL  for  effects  on  female  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development 
was  the  highest  dose  tested  (294  mcg/kg/day).  Based  on  data  from  the  13  week  inhalation  study  in 
(non-pregnant)  female  rats,  exposure  to  GSK573719  in  terms  of  mean  DNAUC0-t  and  DNCmax  at  a 
similar  dose  (288  mcg/kg/day)  was  16.2  ng.h/mL  and  3.79  ng/mL,  respectively  (Report 
WD2007/02012). 
GW642444 
Rat 
Male fertility  
GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as a dry powder formulation 
to male Sprague Dawley rats (25/group) at estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 62, 824 or 31508 
mcg/kg/day (4 or 40% w/w blend in lactose) once daily for 60 minutes by nose only inhalation for 54 
to  57  days.  After  14  days  of  treatment,  treated  males  were  co-habited  1:1  with  untreated  females. 
Mated females were separated from the males and considered to be on Day 0 post coitum (pc). Mated 
females and their litters were euthanized on Day 20 pc. 
Paternal effects were evidenced at 824 and 31508 mcg/kg/day by increased body weight gain and post 
dosing  clinical  signs  (salivation,  periorbital  fur  staining  and/or  wetness  of  the  muzzle  and  lower  jaw 
associated  with  salivation).  Mating,  fertility  and  conception  rate  were  unaffected.  Slight  organ  weight 
differences  in  epididymis  ventral  prostate  and  seminal  vesicles  at  824  and  31508  mcg/kg/day  were 
inconsequential to mating or fertility and therefore not considered adverse effects. The NOAEL for male 
fertility was considered to be ≥31508 mcg/kg/day. 
Female fertility and early embryonic development 
The effects of GW642444 on mating and fertility and on early embryonic development to implantation 
were  assessed  in  a  study  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats.  GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt, 
GW642444M)  was  administered  as  a  dry  powder  formulation  to  mated  females  (25/group)  at 
estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 49.4 or 664 mcg/kg/day (as a 4% blend in lactose) or 37112 
mcg/kg/day  (as  a  40%  blend  in  lactose)  via  snout  only  inhalation  (1  hour)  for  15  days  before  co-
habitation,  during  co-habitation  with  untreated  males  (1  to  12  days)  and  on  Days  0  to  6  pc.  Mated 
females and their litters were euthanized on Day 20 pc. 
Evidence  of  maternal  effects  was  noted  at  ≥49.4  mcg/kg/day  as  indicated  by  increased  body  weight 
and  body  weight  gains.  There  was  no  evidence  of  an  adverse  effect  on  female  fertility  or  early 
embryonic  development.  Based  on  these  results,  the  NOAEL  for  effects  on  female  fertility  and  early 
embryonic development in this study was considered to be ≥37112 mcg/kg/day.

Embryo-fœtal development 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
Rat 
GSK573719  was  administered  as  a  dry  powder  formulation  (0.5%  w/w  with  1%  w/w  magnesium 
stearate  in  lactose  monohydrate)  to  mated  female  Sprague  Dawley  rats  (22/group)  at  estimated 
achieved  doses  of  0  (vehicle),  31.7,  96.9  or  278  mcg/kg/day  by  snout-only  inhalation  (1-hour)  on 
Days 6 to 17 pc (Report WD2007/00764). Mated females and their litters were euthanised on Day 21 
pc. 
GSK573719-related decreases in maternal body weight gain were evident at doses ≥96.9 mcg/kg/day. 
There were no adverse effects on numbers of corpora lutea, implantations, resorptions or live and dead 
fetuses  per  litter,  gravid  uterine  weight  or  placental  morphology.  There  was  no  test  article-related 
effect  on  fetal body  weight  or  morphology.  There  were  no  adverse effects  on the  pregnant  female or 
embryofetal  survival  and  development.  The  NOAEL  for  embryofetal  development  in  the  rat  was 
therefore identified in this study as 278 mcg/kg/day. Based on data from the 13 week inhalation study 
in  (non-pregnant)  female  rats,  exposure  to  GSK573719  in  terms  of  mean  DNAUC0-t  and  DNCmax  at  a 
similar  dose  (288  mcg/kg/day)  was  16.2  ng.h/mL  and  3.79  ng/mL,  respectively  (Report 
WD2007/02012). 
Rabbit 
Dose range finding and preliminary EFD study (Report WD2006/03186) 
GSK573719  was  administered  as  a  dry  powder  formulation  (40%  w/w  with  magnesium  stearate  1% 
w/w  in  lactose  monohydrate)  to  mated  and  unmated  female  Sprague  Dawley  rats  (5  and  4/group 
respectively) at estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 128, 257 or 1820 mcg/kg/day or 48.2 or 305 
mcg/kg/day  respectively  by  snout-only  inhalation  (1-hour)  for  13  days.  The  unmated  animals  were 
sacrificed on Day 14; the mated animals were sacrificed on Day 29 pc.  
In  the  unmated  animals,  there  were  no  GSK573719-related  clinical  signs.  Treatment  at  1820 
mcg/kg/day  was  associated  with  a  treatment-related  body  weight  loss  (mean  0.18  kg)  during  the 
dosing period. There was no conclusive effect of treatment on body weight at lower doses. There were 
treatment-related  reductions  in  mean  food  consumption  in  all  treated  groups  relative  to  pre-dose 
consumption, with the reduction more marked at 1820 mcg/kg/day than at lower doses. 
In the mated animals, there were no GSK573719-related clinical signs or apparent effect on maternal 
body  weight  gain.  At  the  high  dose  (305  mcg/kg/day)  there  was  a  GSK573719-related  decrease  in 
mean food consumption. Macroscopic examination revealed no treatment-related findings in the dams. 
There  was  no  effect  of  treatment  on  embryofetal  survival,  since  the  mean  live  litter  size  in  rabbits 
receiving 305 mcg/kg/day was similar to controls. Mean fetal weights in the test article-treated groups 
were  slightly  lower  than  controls.  However,  review  of  the  individual  litter  values  did  not  reveal  any 
conclusive effect of treatment. One fetus from a dam receiving 42.8 mcg/kg/day was observed to have 
an  irregular  fissure  of  the  cranium  (left),  with  exposed  neural  tissue,  open  eyelids  (right)  and  a 
partially restricted oral cavity. However, in the absence of any fetal abnormalities in rabbits receiving 
305 mcg/kg/day, these abnormalities were considered not to be related to GSK573719. 
On  Day  11,  mean  DNAUC 0-t  values  were  0.668  and  16.3  ng.h/mL  for  GSK573719  doses  of  48.2  and 
305 mcg/kg/day, respectively.

GSK573719  was  administered  as  a  dry  powder  formulation  (2%  w/w  with  1%  w/w  magnesium 
stearate in lactose monohydrate) to mated female New Zealand white rabbits (22/group) at estimated 
achieved  doses  of  0  (control),  28.5,  88.9  or  306  mcg/kg/day  by  snout-only  inhalation  (1-hour)  on 
Days 7 to 19 pc (Report WD2007/00762). Mated females and their litters were euthanised on Day 29 
pc.  There  were  3  deaths,  none  of  which  were  considered  GSK573719-related.  One  female  at  306 
mcg/kg/day aborted her litter on Day 19 pc. One female at 88.9 mcg/kg/day was sacrificed on Day 28 
pc  due  to  poor  condition.  A  second  female  at  88.9  mcg/kg/day  was  sacrificed  on  Day  28  pc  due  to 
clinical  signs,  indicating  a  possible  abortion,  although  there  was  no  evidence  at  necropsy  and  uterine 
examination  of  abortion.  Overall  mean  food  consumption  during  the  treatment  period  was  slightly 
lower  than  controls  in  all  treated  groups.  There  were  no  adverse  effects  on  embryofetal  survival, 
weight  or  development.  The  NOAEL  for  embryofetal  development  in  the  rabbit  was  306  mcg/kg/day, 
the highest dose tested. At the NOAEL, on Day 11 mean DNAUC0-t and DNCmax values were 10.9 and 
1.78 ng/mL, respectively. 
GSK573719  (0,  40.0,  100  or  180  mcg/kg/day)  was  administered  subcutaneously  to  female  New 
Zealand  white  rabbits  (22/group)  once  daily  on  Days  7  to  19  pc  (Report  CD2010/00253).  Mated 
females  and  their  litters  were  euthanized  on  Day  29  pc.  There  were  no  GSK573719-related  deaths. 
There were GSK573719-related maternal fecal observations (soft feces and decreased fecal output at 
180  mcg/kg/day,  elongated  feces  at  all  doses)  both  during  the  treatment  period  and  after  treatment 
ceased.  There  were  no  GSK573719-related  effects  on  maternal  body  weight.  At  100  and  180 
mcg/kg/day, there was a statistically significant decrease in maternal food consumption. There was no 
GSK573719-related  effect  on  mean  numbers  of  corpora  lutea  or  implantations,  resorptions,  pre-
implantation  loss,  post-implantation  loss,  total  live  fetuses,  percent  live  males,  placental  morphology 
or on uterus weight at any dose tested. There was no GSK573719-related effect on fetal body weight 
at  any  dose.  There  were  no  GSK573719-related  fetal  malformations  or  variations  at  any  dose.  There 
were no effects on embryofetal development, therefore, the NOAEL for rabbit embryofetal development 
is  180  mcg/kg/day,  the  highest  dose  tested.  At  the  NOAEL,  mean  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  values  were  61.4 
ng.h/mL and 65.4 ng/mL, respectively. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Rat 
Embryofetal development studies 
GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as a dry powder formulation 
to mated female Sprague Dawley rats (22/group) at estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 45.4 or 
613  mcg/kg/day  (as  a  4%  blend  in  lactose)  or  33733  mcg/kg/day  (as  a  40%  blend  in  lactose)  via 
snout only inhalation (1 hour) on Days 6 to 17 pc. Mated females and their litters were euthanized on 
Day 21 pc. 
Maternal effects at ≥613 mcg/kg/day was evidenced by substantially increased body weight gains and 
increased  or  decreased  food  consumption.  There  was  no  evidence  of  an  adverse  effect  on  pregnancy 
(numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live fetuses and dead fetuses, resorptions, sex ratio, and 
the  pre  and  post  implantation  losses)  or  on  embryofetal  development  (no  major  malformations  nor 
minor  external,  visceral  or  skeletal  anomalies).  Based  on  these  results,  the  developmental  NOAEL  on 
this study was considered to be >33733 mcg/kg/day. 
Rabbit

development study. GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as a dry 
powder  formulation  (40% (w/w)  blend  in  lactose)  to  groups  of  non-pregnant  (4/group)  and  pregnant 
(5/group)  New  Zealand  white  rabbits,  at  estimated achieved  doses  of  447,  1350,  5120,  19600  (non-
pregnant) and 0, 5330 and 18800 mcg/kg/day (pregnant), via snout only inhalation (1 hour) for up to 
13 days which in the pregnant animals was from Days 7 to 19 pc. 
Treatment  with  GW642444  at  doses  up  to  19600  mcg/kg/day  was  well  tolerated  by  unmated  female 
rabbits following snout-only inhalation administration for 1 hour per day for up to 13 days. Treatment 
of  pregnant  female  rabbits  from  Days  7  to  19  pc  at  5330  or  18800  mcg/kg/day  was  associated  with 
lower  group  mean  food  consumption  during  the  first  2  days  of  treatment  (Days  7  to  8  pc). 
Unacceptable levels of intrauterine deaths were noted at 18800 mcg/kg/day. Open eyelid was evident 
in  fetuses  at  5330  and  18800  mcg/kg/day,  limb,  snout  and  palate  malformations  were  also  noted  at 
18800 mcg/kg/day. 
Toxicokinetic  evaluation  on  Day  5  of  treatment  (Day  11  post  coitum)  at  5330  mcg/kg/day  revealed 
study exposure normalised AUC0-t of 244 ng.h/mL and Cmax of 110 ng/mL  
In the main pivotal study, GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as 
a dry powder formulation (7% (w/w) blend in lactose) to mated New Zealand white rabbits (22/group) 
at estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 62.7, 591 and 5740 mcg/kg/day via snout only inhalation 
(1 hour) from Days 7 to 19 pc. Pregnant rabbits and their litters were killed on Day 29 pc. 
Mean fetal weight was low at 5740 mcg/kg/day. GW642444 at 5740 mcg/kg/day caused open/partially 
open eyelids/punctate opening, cleft palate and forelimb flexure/malrotation. Also, at 62.7 mcg/kg/day 
there were open/partially open eyelids/punctuate opening and cleft palate. A dose relationship was not 
established (these abnormalities were not found at 591 mcg/kg/day), suggesting the aetiology of the 
findings  at  the  low  dose may  be  multifactoral  (test  article  and other  factors).  In  addition,  there  were 
higher incidences of fetuses/litters with bridges of ossification/partially fused/fused sternebral centres, 
small  misshapen  interparietals,  enlarged  anterior/posterior  fontanelle,  incomplete  ossification  of  the 
5th  sternebrae,  epiphyses  and  metacarpals/phalanges  and  an  associated  costal  cartilage  abnormality 
in the 5740 mcg/kg/day group compared with controls, which may reflect the lower mean fetal weight 
in this group.  A clear developmental no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) for GW642444M was 
not  identified  in  this  study.  The  exposure  (normalised  AUC  and  Cmax)  at  the  lowest  dose  of  62.7 
mcg/kg/day were 3.76 ng.h/mL and 2.07 ng/mL, respectively. 
Dose ranging and pivotal subcutaneous embryofetal development studies  
Subcutaneous studies were conducted in the rabbit in order to determine whether the low incidence of 
developmental effects observed following inhalation administration of GW642444 could be reproduced.  
In  a  dose  range  finding  study,  GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  was 
administered  at  doses of 20,  200  and 2000  mcg/kg/day,  via  subcutaneous  injection  (formulated  as a 
solution in 20/80 PEG400/8% 2HPBC), to pregnant New Zealand white rabbits (4/group) from Day 7 to 
11 pc. Mated females and their litters were euthanized on Day 12 pc. GW642444 produced no effects 
on  clinical  signs,  body  weight  or  food  consumption  and  all  animals  were  pregnant  at  scheduled 
euthanasia.  At  the  highest  tolerated  dose  of  2000  mcg/kg/day  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  values  were  2160 
mcg.h/mL and 408 mcg/mL, respectively, for GW642444. 
In the main pivotal study, GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered to 
pregnant  New  Zealand  white  rabbits  (22/group)  at  doses  of  0  (vehicle  alone),  3,  7,  30  or  300 
mcg/kg/day, via subcutaneous injection (formulated as a solution in 20/80 PEG400/8% 2HPBC), from 
Days 7 to 19 pc. Mated females and their litters were euthanized on Day 29 pc. 
Maternal  body  weights  were  increased  at  30  and  300  mcg/kg/day,  while  food  consumption  was 
decreased  at  300  mcg/kg/day  at  the  end  of  the  drug  treatment  period.  Fetal  body  weights  were

reduced  at  300  mcg/kg/day  and  fetal  skeletal  variations  (less  than  the  expected  number  of  ossified 
forepaw metacarpals, talus bone not ossified, and cervical vertebral centrum not ossified) indicative of 
developmental delay were also observed at this dose level. Open eye, a malformation, observed in one 
fetus at 300 mcg/kg/day  was considered treatment-related since it was observed at a similar plasma 
exposure  in  another  study  when  GW642444  was  administered  by  inhalation,  and  it  is  a  common 
finding in rabbit fetuses when β2-agonists are administered to does by inhalation administration. The 
NOAEL  for  embryofetal  development  in  rabbits  was  therefore  30  mcg/kg/day  based  upon  the 
decreased fetal weights, fetal skeletal variations indicative of developmental delay and the observation 
of  open  eye  at  300  mcg/kg/day.  The  AUC0-t  values  at  30  mcg/kg/day  for  GW642444  and  its 
counterion  GI179710  (triphenylacetate)  were  22.4  and  18.4  ng.h/mL,  respectively,  and  the  Cmax 
values for these 2 analytes were 6.26 and 12.4 ng/mL, respectively. 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
A definitive embryofetal development study with the GSK573719/GW642444 combination has not been 
performed.  
A  dose  range-finding  rabbit  embryofetal  study  on  GSK573719  alone  and  in  combination  with 
GW642444 was conducted in pregnant New Zealand while rabbits via the subcutaneous route on Days 
7 to 19 pc (Report CD2009/00970). 
The study was conducted in two rounds. In Round 1, timed mated rabbits (4/group) were given 0.02, 
0.18  or  1.5  mg/kg/day  GSK573719.  In  Round  2,  timed  mated  rabbits  (4/group)  were  given  0.1 
mg/kg/day GSK573719 alone or both 0.1 mg/kg/day GSK573719 and 0.1 mg/kg/day GW642444.  
All rabbits given GSK573719 produced elongated abnormally shaped feces, and in general, rabbits with 
decreased  food  consumption  correlated  with  decrements  in  fecal  output.  There  were  no  other 
GSK573719-related or GSK573719 and GW642444-related clinical findings. 
In Round 1, a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day GSK573719 was not tolerated due to excessive body weight loss 
(group  mean  body  weight  loss  of  up  to  5.4%  from starting  Day  7  body  weights)  and  decreased  food 
consumption.  Consequently,  this  dose  group  was  terminated  early  on  Day  16  pc  with  one  rabbit that 
was  more  severely  affected  terminated  on  Day  14  pc.  In  the  group  receiving  0.18  mg/kg/day 
GSK573719,  decreased  body  weight  gain  (5.2%  vs  7.9%  in  controls  between  Day  7  and  Day  29  pc) 
was  observed  which  was  accompanied  by  transient  decreases  in  food  consumption  in  some  rabbits. 
There  were  no  GSK573719-related  effects  on  body  weight  or  food  consumption  in  rabbits  given  0.02 
mg/kg/day.  There  were  no  GSK573719-related  effects  on  pregnancy  and  embryofetal  development 
(only 0.02 and 0.18 mg/kg/day dose levels were examined).  
In Round 2, there were no GSK573719 alone (0.1 mg/kg/day) or GSK573719 and GW642444-related 
(0.1/0.1  mg/kg/day)  effects  on  body  weights,  food  consumption  or  embryofetal  development.  The 
systemic  exposures  (AUC)  achieved  at  these  doses  in  the  combination  group  were  39.4  and  130 
ng.h/mL for GSK573719 and GW642444, respectively.  
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
GSK573719  was  given  subcutaneously  by  injection  at  doses  of  10,  60  or  180  mcg/kg/day  to  female 
Sprague Dawley rats (n= 24) from Day 6 pc through Day 20 post partum (pp) (Report 2011N118595). 
F0  females  were  allowed  to  deliver  naturally.  Mated (F0)  females  were euthanized  on  Day  21  pp.  On 
Post-Natal  Day  (PND)  21, F1  males  and  females  (2/sex/litter)  were  assigned  to  each  dose  group  and 
assigned  to  one  of  two  subsets.  Subset  1  was  selected  for  acoustic  startle  habituation  (PND  45  ±  2) 
and  reproductive  performance.  Mated  F1  females  assigned  to  Subset  1  were  allowed  to  deliver 
naturally and the dams and F2 litters were evaluated until Day 7 pp. Subset 2 was selected for acoustic

startle  habituation  (PND  77  ±  3),  motor  activity  (PND  46 ±  2)  and  modified  M-watermaze  evaluations 
(PND 70 ± 2).  
There were no F0 maternal GSK573719-related mortalities, clinical or necropsy observations during the 
pc or pp periods. There were slight GSK573719-related reductions in F0 maternal body weight gain in 
the  180  mcg/kg/day  dose  group  during  the  pc  dosing  period  (Days  6  to  21  pc)  but  there  were  no 
effects  in  the  pp  period,  and  the  overall  mean  body  weight  on  Day  21  pp  was  comparable  to  the 
control  mean  value.  Decreases  in  F0  maternal  food  consumption  occurred  during  the  first  dosing 
interval  at  ≥60  mcg/kg/day.  Food  consumption  continued  to  be  reduced  at  180  mcg/kg/day  for  the 
remainder  of  the  pc  period  and  throughout  the  pp  period  as  compared  to  the  control  means.  There 
were  no  adverse  GSK573719-related  effects  on  the  F0  maternal  duration  of  gestation,  average  pup 
delivery  time,  number  of  liveborn  pups,  viability  index  or  gestation  index,  mean  number  of  live  pups 
per litter, percentage of male pups per litter or post-natal viability at any dose. 
There were no F1 GSK573719-related mortalities or clinical observations during pre- or post-weaning. 
During  pre-weaning  (PND  1  to  21),  there  were  GSK573719-related  reductions  in  the  F1  mean  body 
weights from PND 7 to 21 at 180 mcg/kg/day (a dose which caused decreased maternal body weight 
gain and food consumption). 
During the F1 generation post-weaning period, there were no GSK573719-related mortalities or clinical 
observations  or  adverse  effects  on  the  body  weights,  body  weight  gains  or  food  consumption.  There 
were  no  GSK573719-related  effects  on  the  mean  day  of  sexual  maturation  or  any  behavioral 
parameter  (acoustic  startle  habituation,  motor  activity  or  learning  or  retention  of  a  spatial  navigation 
task) at any dose. All reproductive capacity parameters for the F1 generation (mating, fertility, mating 
index, average number of days in co-habitation and estrous cycling) were comparable among all dose 
groups.  The  mean  duration  of  gestation  and  the  mean  pup  delivery  time  were  comparable  among  all 
dose  groups.  There  were  no  GSK573719-related  effects  on  litter  size,  pup  survival,  clinical  and 
necropsy observations or mean body weights in the F2 generation pups. The NOAEL for maternal (F0) 
reproductive  function  was  180  mcg/kg/day  and  for  the  pre-  and  post-natal  development  of  the 
offspring  in  rats  was  60  mcg/kg/day  due  to  the  decreased  pre-weaning  pup  weight.  At  the  NOAEL, 
mean AUC0-t values for F0 dams were 24.9 ng.h/mL and 24.5 ng/mL, respectively. 
Vilenterol (GW642444) 
Rat 
Pre- and post-natal development study 
GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was given to groups of mated female Sprague 
Dawley  rats  (24/group)  by  oral  gavage  administration  at  doses  of  0  (vehicle),  300,  3000  and  10000 
mcg/kg/day  beginning  on  Day  6  pc  and  continuing  to  Day  20  post  partum  (pp)  as  a  suspension  in 
1.0% w/v aqueous methylcellulose. F0 females were allowed to deliver naturally. Mated (F0) females 
were  euthanized  on  Day  21  pp.  On  Postnatal  Day  (PND)  21,  46  to  48  F1  males  and  46  to  48  F1 
females were assigned to each dose group and assigned to one of two subsets. Subset 1 was selected 
for  PND  77  auditory  startle  habituation  evaluation  and  reproductive  performance.  Mated  F1  females 
assigned to Subset 1 were allowed to deliver naturally and the dams and F2 litters were evaluated until 
Day  7  pp.  Subset  2  was  selected  for  motor  activity,  PND  45  auditory  startle  habituation,  and  Morris 
Watermaze evaluations. F1 offspring assigned to Subset 2 were euthanized after behavior testing was 
completed.  F1  males  assigned  to  Subset  1  were  euthanized  following  completion  of  the  cohabitation 
period,  and  F1  females  assigned  to  Subset  1  were  allowed  to  deliver  naturally,  and  were  then 
euthanized with their litters (F2 offspring) on Day 7 pp. 
Increases in the mean maternal F0 body weight and body weight gains throughout the post coitum and 
post  partum  periods  at  all  dose  levels  with  a  related  increase  in  food  consumption  during  the  post

coitum period at 10 mg/kg/day and an increase in the average delivery time per pup at 10 mg/kg/day 
were considered to be related to the pharmacology. There were no other adverse effects on maternal 
(F0) pregnancy, parturition, lactation or offspring (F1) survival.   
Pre- and post-weaning body weights were decreased in the 3 and 10 mg/kg/day dose groups without 
any adverse consequences to other measures of growth and development. There were no effects on F1 
neurobehavioral or reproductive function (F1 pregnancy, parturition and lactation) or F2 survival. 
The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal (F0) reproductive function as well as effects 
on pre- and post-natal development of the offspring in rats is 10 mg/kg/day; the highest group tested. 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
No  prenatal  and  post-natal  development  studies  have  been  performed  for  the  combination 
umeclidinium  bromide/vilanterol  which  is  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP  based  on  the  data 
available on both compounds. 
Local Tolerance  
Umeclidnium bromide (GSK573719) 
Dermal Irritancy Local lymph node assay in the mouse (Report 2011N123962) 
GSK573719  (50  mcL  25%  w/w  in  propylene  glycol) was  topically  applied to  the  dorsal  surface  of  the 
ear of CBA/Ca strain mouse (5/F/group) daily for 3 days. No signs of systemic toxicity or local irritation 
were noted in the GSK573719-treated or control animals during the test. Body weight changes of the 
GSK573719-treated  animals  between  Day  1  and  Day  6  were  comparable  to  those  observed  in  the 
corresponding  control  group  animals  over  the  same  period.  GSK573719  was  considered to  be  a  non-
sensitiser under the conditions of the test.  
Dermal Irritancy- 7-day study in rabbits (Report 2012N139906) 
GSK573719  (0  (vehicle),  0.5%,  1%  or  2%  as  solutions  in  1%  propylene  glycol/99%  (60% 
ethanol/40%  water))  was  dermally  administered  to  male  rabbits  (2/group)  once  daily  for  a  period  of 
approximately 20 hours for 7 days. Animals treated with GSK573719 had dose-responsive test article-
related minimal to marked microscopic findings in the application skin sites that were consistent with 
irritation  (dermal  mixed  inflammatory  cell  infiltrate,  epidermal  neutrophilic  exudate,  dermal  edema, 
acanthosis multifocal ulceration and/or subcutaneous congestion). Very slight erythema was noted on 
the vehicle abraded skin site of one animal in the control group and on the abraded test article site of 
one animal in each group given 0.5%, 1% or 2% GSK573719. 
Dermal  irritancy  -  GSK573719:  determination  of  skin  irritation  potential  using  the  skinethic 
reconstituted human epidermal model (Report 2011N123960) 
A  study  was  performed  to  determine  the  skin  irritation  potential  of  GSK573719  (25  mg)  using  the 
SkinEthic Reconstituted Human Epidermal model (RHE, SkinEthic Laboratories, Nice, France) following 
treatment periods of 4 and 24 hours. A prediction of skin irritation potential of GSK573719 was made 
based on % viability. The relative mean viability of the GSK573719-treated tissues was 78.0% after 4 
hours exposure and 23.2% after 24 hours exposure, indicating that GSK573719 was considered to be 
a mild-moderate irritant. 
Ocular Irritancy -  GSK573719: determination of eye irritation potential using an in vitro test strategy 
(Report 2011N123961) 
A  study  was  performed  to  determine  the  eye  irritation  potential  of  GSK573719  (30  mg)  using  the 
SkinEthic  Reconstituted  Human  Corneal  model  (RHC,  SkinEthic  Laboratories,  Nice,  France)  following 
Assessment report

treatment periods of 10 and 60 minutes. A prediction of the eye irritation potential of GSK573719 was 
made based on % viability. The relative mean viability of GSK573719-treated tissues was 80.2% after 
a  10  minute  exposure  and  10.6%  after  a  60  minute  exposure,  indicating  that  GSK573719  was 
considered to be a mild-moderate ocular irritant. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Dermal irritancy - Local lymph node assay in the mouse 
A study was performed to assess the skin sensitisation potential of the GW642444 in the CBA/Ca strain 
mouse following topical application to the dorsal surface of the ear. Following a preliminary screening 
test,  a  group  of  four  animals  were  treated  with  50  mcL  (25  mcL  per  ear)  of  GW642444  at  a 
concentration of 50% w/w in dimethyl formamide (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) daily for 
3 days. A further group of four animals was treated with dimethyl formamide alone. All animals were 
observed twice daily on Days 1, 2 and 3 and on a daily basis on Days 4, 5 and 6. 
No signs of systemic toxicity or local irritation were noted in the GW642444 treated or control animals 
during  the  test.  Off  white  residual  test  material  on  ears  and  fur  was  noted  in  GW642444  treated 
animals  post  dose  on  Day  1  and  on  Days  2  to  5.  Bodyweight  changes  of  the  GW642444  treated 
animals  between  Day  1  and  Day  6  were  comparable  to  those  observed  in  the  corresponding  control 
group  animals  over  the  same  period.  GW642444  was  considered  to  be  a  non-sensitiser  under  the 
conditions of the test. 
Dermal  irritancy  -  GW642444:  determination  of  skin  irritation  potential  using  the  skinethic 
reconstituted human epidermal model  
A study was performed to determine the skin irritation potential of GW642444 (as the  triphenylacetate 
salt,  GW642444M)  using  the  SkinEthic  Reconstituted  Human  Epidermalmodel  (RHE,  SkinEthic 
Laboratories,  Nice,  France)  following  treatment  periods  of  4  and  24  hours.  The  test  is  based  on  the 
hypothesis  that  irritant  chemicals  are  able  to  penetrate  the  stratum  corneum  of  the  SkinEthic  RHE 
model and are sufficiently cytotoxic to cause cell death in the underlying cell layers. Triplicate SkinEthic 
tissues were treated with 25 mg of GW642444 and exposed for 4 hours and 24 hours. A prediction of 
skin irritation potential of the GW642444 was made based on % viability. The relative mean viability of 
the GW642444 treated tissues was 110.1% after 4 hours exposure and 93.9% after 24 hours exposure 
indicating that GW642444 was considered to be a non irritant. 
Ocular irritancy - GW642444: determination of eye irritation potential using an in vitro test strategy  
A study was performed to determine the eye irritation potential of GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate 
salt,  GW642444M)  using  the  SkinEthic  Reconstituted  Human  Corneal  model  (RHC,  SkinEthic 
Laboratories, Nice, France) following treatment periods of 10 and 60 minutes. The test is based on the 
hypothesis that irritant chemicals are able to penetrate the corneal epithelial tissue and are sufficiently 
cytotoxic  to  cause  cell  death.  Triplicate  SkinEthic  tissues  were  treated  with  30  mg  of  GW642444  and 
exposed for 10 minutes and 60 minutes. A prediction of the eye irritation potential of the GW642444 
was  made  based  on %  viability.  The  relative  mean  viability  of  GW642444 treated  tissues  was  98.2% 
after a 10 minute exposure and 97.2% after a 60 minute exposure indicating that GW642444 was not 
likely to be a severe ocular irritant. 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
No  local  toterance  studies  have  been  performed  for  the  combination  umeclidinium  bromide/vilanterol 
which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Immunotoxicity 
A  weight  of  evidence  review  of  immunotoxicity  potential  for  the  combination  of  GSK573719  and 
GW642444 has been conducted. 
Preclinical  literature  from  knockout  mice  and  pan  mAChR  antagonists  (atropine  and  tiotropium 
bromide)  demonstrate  that  mAChR  antagonists  have  the  potential  to  be  immunomodulators  and  that 
atropine  had  immunosuppressive  effects  in  mice  and  rats  following  systemic  (osmotic  pump, 
intraperitoneal  or  intravenous)  administration.  The  risk  of  potential  immunosuppression  with 
GSK573719 is mitigated by administration via the inhalation route which minimizes systemic exposure. 
Furthermore,  the  extensive  clinical  safety  data  and  post-marketing  experience  with  inhaled  Spiriva 
(tiotropium  bromide)  demonstrates  no  significantly  increased  incidence  of  immune-related  adverse 
effects. In addition, there were no findings in general toxicology studies or clinical safety signals with 
GSK573719  alone  or  in  combination  with  GW642444  that  indicate  immunotoxicity.  Based  on  this 
assessment, additional preclinical testing to evaluate the immunotoxicity potential of GSK573719 and 
GW642444 alone or in combination has not been conducted. In clinical studies, there was no evidence 
of  a  higher  incidence  of  infections  up  to  and  including  the  maximum  proposed  human  dose  (125/25 
mcg/day GSK573719/GW642444). 
Studies on impurities 
Assessments  of  the  route  of  synthesis  for  GSK573719  and  GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt) 
has  been  conducted  to  determine  whether  any  impurities  might  be  present  which  are  known  or 
suspected DNA-reactive genotoxins, and to assess the likelihood of any such impurities being present 
in final drug product. 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
Ames  tests  were  performed  with  the  following  potential  genotoxic  impurities  (GR130510X  [Report 
2012N146384],  GR59413X  [Report  2010N111625],  and  GW348594X  [Report  2010N110596]).  An 
Ames  test  was  also  performed  on  GW377650X  [Report  2010N112354],  a  potential  impurity  in  the 
starting material of synthesis GR130510X. 
Impurities GR130510X, GR59413X, and GW348594X were positive for mutagenic potential in the Ames 
test. Consequently, these impurities are controlled at levels well below the TTC in the drug substance 
specification. This approach was considered acceptable. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Genotoxicity (AMES test) for GW642444 impurities  
An  Ames  test  was  conducted  with  GW844166X  (an  intermediate  in  the  synthesis  of  the  drug 
substance), using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and  TA1537 and Escherichia 
coli  strain  WP2  uvrA  (pKM101)  .  GW844166X  was  formulated  in  dimethyl  sulphoxide  (DMSO)  and 
assays were conducted with concentrations in the range 50 to 5000 mcg/plate. GW844166X induced a 
dose-related increase in the frequency of TA1535 revertant colonies, in the presence of S9 only, from 
50 mcg/plate. These increases achieved a threefold increase over the concurrent vehicle control at 50 
mcg/plate  rising  to  a  22-fold  increase  at  1500  mcg/plate.  Revertant  colony  frequency  increases  in 
excess  of  twofold  were  also  noted  for  TA100  (presence  of  S9  only)  at  500  and  1500  mcg/plate.  No 
significant  increases  in  the  frequency  of  revertant  colonies  were  recorded  for  any  of  the  remaining 
bacterial  strains,  with  any  dose  of  the  test  material,  either  with  or  without  metabolic  activation. 
GW844166X was considered mutagenic under the conditions of this test. 
An  Ames  test  was  conducted  with  2,6-dichlorobenzyl  chloride  (precursor  used  to  manufacture  the 
starting  material  GW842540X)  using  Salmonella  typhimurium  strains  TA98,  TA100,  TA1535  and 
Assessment report

TA1537 and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA (pKM101). 2,6- dichlorobenzyl chloride was formulated in 
dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and assays were conducted with concentrations in the range 1.5 to 1500 
mcg/plate. 2,6- dichlorobenzyl chloride was non-mutagenic in all assays at concentrations up to 1500 
mcg/plate, in the absence and presence of an in vitro metabolic activation system (rat liver S9-mix). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  submitted  for  Anoro  was  prepared  in  compliance  with  the 
Guideline  on 
the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products 
for  Human  Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  The  two  active  substances  umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol  have 
been  assessed  separately.  Predicted  environmental  concentrations  were  significantly  below  the 
threshold value of 0.01 μL, indicating that no a Phase II – Tier A is needed for both active substances. 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
A  Phase  I  environmental  risk  assessment  was  performed  to  evaluate  potential  environmental  risks  of 
umeclidinium  bromide.  The  log  Kow  was  determined  according  to  study  OECD  107  with  a  value  of 
1.354.  Based  on  the  log  Kow  value  being  below  3,  umeclidinium  bromide  is  not  expected  to  be  a bio-
accumulative  substance.  The  environmental  exposure  assessment  was  estimated  according  to  the 
formula for the calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC):

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Anoro  is  a  new  fixed  dose  combination  of  vilanterol,  a  long  acting  beta2-agonist  and  umeclidinium 
bromide,  a  novel  inhaled  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist,  intended  for  the  once  daily  treatment  of 
COPD.  Separate  comprehensive  non-clinical  packages  have  been  conducted  for  both  umeclidinium 
bromide and vilanterol which have adequately characterised the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology of each active alone. Adequate studies with the combination evaluated cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology,  repeated-dose  toxicity  via  the  inhalation  route  for  up  to  13-weeks  and  effects  on 
embryofetal development.  
In toxicity studies with the actives alone, the effects seen were limited to known class-effects of either 
muscarinic  receptor  antagonists  or  beta 2-adrenergic  agonists  respectively  and  local  irritancy.  Little 
evidence of any exacerbation of these effects was seen on administration of the combination product in 
rats and dogs. The use of these classes of compound in COPD is well established and it is considered 
that  adequate  margins  of  safety  exist  between  exposures  at  which  effects  were  seen  and  exposures 
achieved at the clinical dose.  
Umeclidinium  was  not  genotoxic  in  a  standard battery  of  studies  and  was  not  carcinogenic  in  lifetime 
inhalation studies in mice or rats at exposures ≥ 26 or ≥ 22-fold, times the human clinical exposure of 
umeclidinium 55 micrograms, based on AUC, respectively. Umeclidinium bromide was not genotoxic in 
a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in lifetime inhalation studies in rats or mice at 
exposures similar to those at the maximum proposed human dose, based on AUC.  In genetic toxicity 
studies,  vilanterol  (as  alpha-phenylcinnamate)  and  triphenylacetic  acid  were  not  genotoxic  indicating 
that  vilanterol  (as  trifenatate)  does  not  represent  a  genotoxic  hazard  to  humans.  Consistent  with 
findings for other beta2 agonists, in lifetime inhalation studies vilanterol trifenatate caused proliferative 
effects in the female rat and mouse reproductive tract and rat pituitary gland. There was no increase in 
tumour  incidence  in  rats  or  mice  at  exposures  2-  or  30-fold,  respectively,  those  at  the  maximum 
recommended human dose, based on AUC. 
Umeclidinium  was  not  teratogenic  in  rats  or  rabbits.  In  a  pre-  and  post-natal  study,  subcutaneous 
administration  of  umeclidinium  to  rats  resulted  in  lower  maternal  body  weight  gain  and  food 
consumption  and 
slightly  decreased  pre-weaning  pup  body  weights 
in  dams  given 
180 micrograms/kg/day  dose  (approximately  80-times  the  human  clinical  exposure  of  umeclidinium 
55 micrograms, based on AUC). Vilanterol was not teratogenic in rats. In inhalation studies in rabbits, 
vilanterol caused effects similar to those seen with other beta2-adrenergic agonists (cleft palate, open 
eyelids, sternebral fusion and limb flexure/malrotation) at 6-times the human clinical exposure based 
on AUC. When given subcutaneously there were no effects at 36-times the human clinical exposure of 
vilanterol 22 micrograms, based on AUC. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  overall  non-clinical  development  programme  of  the  umeclidinium/vilanterol  FDC  was  considered 
adequate to support the recommendation for a marketing authorisation for Anoro. The available non-
clinical  data  including  the  results  obtained  from  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  and  reproduction  toxicity 
studies  with  Anoro  and  the  environmental  risk  assessment  did  not  raise  any  particular  safety  issue. 
Based  on  the  available  non-clinical  safety  data  with  the  two  compounds,  umeclidinium  bromide  and 
Assessment report

vilanterol, it is concluded that the FDC should be well tolerated when used in humans at the proposed 
dosage.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The  CHMP  was  informed  of  significant  deviations  from  GCP  for  investigator  site  040688.  These 
deviations  were  identified  by  the  Applicant  during  the  conduct  of  the  UMEC/VI  development  program 
and  the  FF/VI  development  program  (prior  to  un-blinding  of  the  DB2113360  and  DB2113359  studies 
and after un-blinding of the AC4115321, HZC102871 and HZC112207 studies). A total of 48 subjects 
from this site were treated in the UMEC/VI program and 25 subjects were treated in studies from the 
FF/VI COPD program relevant to this submission.  
The CHMP was informed on the 1st July 2013 that up to a13% of tiotropium treated patients in study 
DB2113360  (COPD  indication)  were  not  blinded  to  treatment  due  to  an  incorrect  coverage  of  the 
original foil supplied by an US contractor. The Applicant was requested during the evaluation to show 
how  this  issue  did  not  impact  on  the  final  results.  The  Applicant  provided  a  preliminary  analysis  of 
several important clinical endpoints (trough FEV1, 0-6 hour FEV1, SGRQ, TDI) comparing change over 
time  in  patients  treated  with  the  potentially  defectively  masked  tiotropium  to  those  treated  with 
correctly masked tiotropium. However, there are several deficiencies in the analysis provided (e.g. only 
the results for the tiotropium and vilanterol arms were provided, the numbers per treatment arm and 
the dropout rate are unknown). In conclusion, considering that 87% of patients in the tiotropium arm 
were  still  blinded  and  that  the  results  of  the  analyses  of  efficacy  data  were  generally  consistent,  the 
impact  of  the  unblinding  can  be  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP  as  it  does  not  change  the 
benefit/risk of the UMEC/VI combination. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 40 clinical studies have been conducted supporting the clinical pharmacology of UMEC/VI as 
an  inhaled  combination  from  the  novel  dry  powder  inhaler  (NDPI)  or  with  UMEC  or  VI  (administered 
alone  by  a  variety  of  routes).  Studies  conducted  with  UMEC  alone  included  administration  by  the 
inhaled, intravenous, and oral routes. 
Studies  conducted  with  VI  alone  also  included  administration  by  the  IH,  intravenous,  and  PO  routes. 
Clinical  pharmacology  studies  with  UMEC,  VI,  or  UMEC/VI  were  conducted  predominantly  in  healthy 
subjects  but  also  included  subjects  with  COPD,  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment,  and  subjects  with 
renal impairment. In certain instances, PK and PD data for VI is taken from studies which utilized VI in 
combination with FF. The rationale to support the use of PK and PD data from these studies is in part 
due  to  the  fact  that  no  differences  in  VI  PK  are  observed  when  VI  is  administered  alone  or  in 
combination with FF. 
Pharmacokinetic  data  for  UMEC  and  VI  was  also  obtained  from  Phase  IIb  studies  with  the  individual 
components in subjects with COPD and Phase III studies with UMEC/VI (some of these included arms 
with UMEC alone and/or VI alone) in subjects with COPD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 94/308 
 
  
  
The concentration time data from these studies have been used, where possible, to develop population 
pharmacokinetic  models  to  investigate  potential  covariate  effects  such  as  demographics  on  the 
pharmacokinetics and to evaluate potential relationship between UMEC and VI Systemic exposure and 
reported AEs in the Phase IIb and Phase III.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD)  analyses  were  conducted  to  describe  the  concentration 
effect  relationship  β2-adrenoreceptor  mediated  effects  on  heart  rate  and  QT  interval  corrected  for 
heart  rate  using  Fridericia's  formula  (QTc(F)).  Analyses  were  also  conducted  to  describe  the  efficacy 
dose-response relationship for UMEC in Phase IIb.  
Absorption 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of UMEC and VI have been studied separately 
after  oral  and  intravenous  (UMEC  only)  administration  of  radiolabeled  drug  (studies  AC4112014, 
B2C106181,  AC4112008  and  B2C106180).  UMEC  and  VI  PK  parameters  were  also  measured  when 
administered as a combination (see section “Dose proportionality and time dependencies” below). 
Bioavailability 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
Study  AC4112008  evaluated  the  PK  of  UMEC  using  a  single  PO  dose  (1000  mcg),  a  single  IH  dose 
(1000 mcg) and 3 ascending IV doses (20, 50 and 65 mcg) in a cross-over study, in 10 healthy male 
volunteers. This study is the primary study for defining biovailibility of inhaled UMEC. 
Following  a  single  inhaled  dose  administration,  UMEC  was  rapidly  absorbed  with  the  Cmax  values 
occurring at approximately 5 to 15 minutes postdose. Plasma concentrations declined rapidly following 
the  occurrence  of  Cmax.  Plasma  concentrations  of  UMEC  following  single  PO  dose  administration  of 
UMEC were all non-quantifiable (NQ) (bioanalytical assay LLQ was 0.02 ng/mL). Therefore the maximal 
possible oral bioavailability was calculated as <1%. 
Absolute  bioavailability  of  UMEC  following  inhaled  administration  was  calculated  using  plasma  data 
following  1000  mcg  IH  which  averaged 12.8%  (95%  confidence interval  [CI]: 9.0%,  18.2%).  Results 
were similar for urine data, with F averaging 13.1% (95% CI: 10.5%, 16.3%). Absolute bioavailability 
of  UMEC  following  PO  administration  using  plasma  data  was  reported  as  negligible  (<1%)  since  all 
plasma concentrations of UMEC were NQ following PO administration 
Study  AC4112014  was  a  mass-balance  study  using  radiolabeled  UMEC,  which  was  administered  as  a 
single  dose  of  a  PO  solution  of  1000  mcg  and  an  IV  infusion  of  65  mcg.    Samples  were  taken  for  a 
minimum of 168 hours.  
Plasma  concentrations  of  unchanged  UMEC  following  single  PO  dose  administration  of  [14C]-UMEC 
were all not quantifiable (NQ).  
Mean  PO  bioavailability  estimates  of  plasma  14C-radioactivity  following  PO  administrations  of  [14C]-
UMEC  calculated  based  on  AUC(0-∞)  were  similar  to  those  calculated  based  on  AUC(0-t)  and  were 
approximately  5.4%  (95%  CI:  1.8%,  15.9%)  and  4.7%  (95%  CI:  2.1%,  10.3%),  respectively.  Since 
PO bioavailability of unchanged UMEC was negligible, these data suggest that the majority of the dose 
was  not  absorbed  and  that  there  were  low  levels  of  metabolites  in  the  systemic  circulation.  This  was 
also supported by <1% total radioactivity in urine following PO administration. These data support very 
low absorption of radiolabelled drug with negligible absolute bioavailability of UMEC following PO dose. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 95/308 
 
  
  
Study  B2C106180  was  a  PK  study  in  healthy  male  subjects  who  received  single  IV  (2.5,  20  and  55 
mcg), IH (100 mcg) and PO doses (200 mcg and 500 mcg) of VI. 
True estimates of oral and inhaled bioavailability could not be accurately determined from plasma due 
to the low number of subjects with measurable post dose plasma VI concentrations. However, results 
from 100 mcg IH VI and 55 mcg IV VI suggested approximately 30% IH bioavailability calculated from 
the  ratio  of  AUCs  to  a  common  time  point  after  IH  and  IV  administrations.  Consistent  results  were 
obtained from urinary excretion data which indicated approximately 26% IH bioavailability. 
Following 500 mcg PO VI administrations, maximum plasma concentrations were achieved at a median 
time of 0.5 hours post dose. The approximate estimate of PO bioavailability was <2%, calculated from 
the ratio of AUCs to a common time point after PO and IV administrations. 
Study BC106181 was a mass-balance study using radio-labelled VI following a single oral dose of 200 
mcg solution to healthy volunteers. Samples were collected for up to 168 hours after dosing. Based on 
all  NQ  data  for  parent  VI  in  5  out  of  6  subjects  and  sparse  quantifiable  data  from  the  remaining 
subject, it was concluded that VI only represented an estimated <0.5% of the circulating drug-related 
material in plasma. These results along with presence of one or more circulating metabolites suggested 
extensive first-pass metabolism of the orally absorbed VI. 
Based  on  urinary  recovery  of  radioactivity  (study  B2C106181),  at  least 50.4%  of  the  VI  solution  oral 
dose  was  absorbed  via  the  gut,  resulting  in  notable  exposure  to  drug  related  material.  Based  on  the 
proportion of unchanged VI in human faeces (5% of the recovered dose) oral absorption is likely to be 
greater than this estimate. Exposure to parent VI represented a very small percentage (in the region of 
<0.5%)  of  the  total  drug-related  material  in  plasma.  This  was  indicative  of  extensive  first-pass 
metabolism of orally absorbed VI and the presence of one or more circulating VI metabolites following 
oral dosing. 
Following oral administration, maximum VI plasma concentrations were achieved at a median time of 
30  minutes  post-dose  (study  B2C106180).  The  low  approximate  estimate  of  VI  oral  bioavailability 
(<2%),  calculated  from  ratio  of  AUCs  to  a  common  time  point  after  oral  and  IV  administration, 
suggested  a  minimal  oral  contribution  to  the  overall  inhaled  pharmacokinetic  profile  in  healthy 
subjects.  Consequently,  following  inhaled  administration,  systemic  VI  exposure  is  primarily  due  to 
absorption of the inhaled portion of the dose delivered to the lung. 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
No  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  umeclidinium  bromide/vilanterol  FDC  which  is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Bioequivalence 
No  bioequivalence  studies  were  performed  with  UMEC/VI  since  there  were  no  changes  to  the 
formulation  after  the  start  of  the  Phase  III  studies  and  the  PK  data  that  is  available  is  considered 
adequate. 
Influence of food 
The  per  oral  (PO)  bioavailability  of  UMEC  is  negligible  (<1%)  and  VI  from  the  swallowed  portion 
undergoes  extensive  first  pass  metabolism  resulting  in  <2%  systemic  exposure  after  oral 
administration. Therefore, even if co-administration with food were to affect the rate and/or extent of 
absorption  of  either  UMEC  or  VI,  it  would  not  be  expected  to  significantly  impact  the  systemic 
exposure, compared with the fasted state, at the proposed clinical doses of UMEC/VI. 
The  oral  bioavailability  of  UMEC  and  VI  are  small  (<2%)  and  therefore  it  is  acceptable  that  no  food 
effect study was performed.

Distribution 
Following intravenous dosing, UMEC was rapidly and extensively distributed with an average tlast of 1 
hour  (study  AC4112014).  The  average  volume  of  distribution  at  steady  state  was  86.2  L,  which  is 
greater than the total body water for a 70 kg man (42 L). 
Blood  cell  association  of  UMEC  was  low  in  humans  with  a  blood-to-plasma  ratio  ranging  from 0.67 at 
45  minutes  post  dose  to  0.82  up  to  24  hours  post  dose  (study  AC4112014).  In  vitro  plasma  protein 
binding of UMEC in human plasma was moderate with an average value of 88.9% and was similar in 
plasma  from  either  males  or  females.  Both  plasma  protein  binding  and  blood  cell  binding  for  UMEC 
were independent of concentration.  
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Following intravenous dosing, VI was extensively distributed (study HZA102934). The average volume 
of  distribution  at  steady-state  was  165  L.  Blood  cell  association  of  VI  had  a  blood-to-plasma  ratio  of 
0.8  for  man  (study  WD2006/02044/00).  In-vitro  plasma  protein  binding  of  VI  in  human  plasma  was 
moderately high with an average value of 93.9%. Both plasma protein binding and blood cell binding 
for VI were independent of concentration.  
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
No  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  umeclidinium  bromide/vilanterol  FDC  which  is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Elimination 
Excretion 
Umeclidinium bromide 
Plasma  clearance  following  intravenous  administration  was  on  average  151  L/h  (95%  CI:  58.5  L/h, 
390.9  L/h;  study  AC4112014).  Following  discontinuation  of  infusion  at  30  minutes  (median  tmax  = 
30min),  unchanged  UMEC  showed  rapid  disappearance  from  systemic  circulation  (median  tlast  =  1 
hour)  and  an  elimination  half-life  following  intravenous  administration  could  not  be  estimated. 
Approximately 58% of the administered radiolabelled dose (or 73% of the recovered radioactivity) was 
excreted in faeces by 192 hours post dose. Urinary elimination accounted for 22% of the administered 
radiolabelled  dose  by  168  hours  (27%  of  recovered  radioactivity).  The  excretion  of  the  drug-related 
material  in  the  faeces  following  intravenous  dosing  suggests  evidence  for  biliary  secretion.  The 
discrepancy  between  administered  and  recovered  radioactivity  is  most  likely  explained  by  a 
combination of non-specific losses during sample processing (exacerbated by the low chemical mass in 
excreta samples) and the slow elimination of a small proportion of the dose, with collection of excreta 
stopping 8 days after dosing. 
Following  oral  administration  of  (14C)-UMEC  to  healthy  male  subjects  in  Study  AC4112014,  total 
radioactivity was excreted primarily in feces (92% of the administered radiolabeled dose or 99% of the 
recovered radioactivity), by 168 hours post dose. Less than 1% of the orally administered dose (1% of 
recovered radioactivity) was excreted in urine, suggesting negligible absorption following an oral dose. 
UMEC  plasma  elimination  half-life  following  IH  dosing  for  10  days  averaged  19  hours  (study 
DB2114635). Following IH UMEC, approximately 1%-2% and 3%-4% of the drug following single and 
repeat dosing, respectively, was excreted unchanged in urine. Renal clearance was on average 6 to 20 
Assessment report

L/h suggesting elimination via glomerular filtration and possible renal tubular secretion. Urine half-life 
of UMEC was on average approximately 9 to 35 hours and is consistent with UMEC half-life observed in 
plasma. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
The  intravenous  pharmacokinetics  of  VI  showed  high  plasma  clearance  (geometric  mean:  108  L/h 
[95% CI: 86.2 L/h, 135 L/h]) (study HZA102934). The apparent terminal phase elimination half-life of 
VI  following  intravenous  dosing  was,  on  average,  2.40  h  (95%  CI:  1.65,  3.48).  Following  oral 
administration of [14C]VI to healthy male subjects in clinical study B2C106181 total radioactivity was 
excreted  primarily  in  urine  (50.4%  of  the  administered  radioactive  dose  or  70%  of  the  recovered 
radioactivity).  Faecal  elimination  accounted  for  21.2%  of  the  administered  radioactive  dose  over  the 
168  h  post-dose  period  (corresponding  to  30%  of  the  recovered  radioactivity).  Most  of  the  urinary 
radioactivity (48.4% of the administered radioactive dose) was excreted within 24 hours post-dose and 
most of  the  faecal  radioactivity  (20.6% of  the  administered  radioactive  dose)  was  excreted  within  96 
hour  post-dose.  Although  only  72%  of  the  administered  radioactive  dose  was  recovered  in  urine  and 
faeces  collected  over  7  days  post-dose,  the  elimination  of  VI  drug-related  material  was  essentially 
complete  within  120  hour  of  dosing  with  less  than  0.2%  of  the  administered  oral  radioactive  dose 
being recovered in the 120 to 144 h and 144 to 168 hour urine and faecal post-dose collections. The 
discrepancy  between  administered  and  recovered  radioactivity  is  most  likely  due  to  technical 
consequences  resulting  from  the  analytical  approaches  required  as  a  result  of  the  low  chemical  and 
radioactive doses administered. 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
No  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  FDC  umeclidinium  bromide/vilanterol  which  is 
considered acceptable. 
Metabolism 
Umeclidinium bromide 
The  human  metabolism  of  UMEC  was  investigated  using  fecal,  urine,  plasma,  and  bile  samples 
collected  following  intravenous  (65  mcg)  and  oral  (1000  mcg)  administration  of  (14C)-UMEC  in  study 
AC4112014.  
Disposition  of  UMEC  following  intravenous  administration  was  by  a  combination  of  biliary  and  renal 
secretion of unchanged UMEC and metabolism. The major routes of metabolism were via hydroxylation 
(M33)  and  O-dealkylation  (M14)  with  metabolites  being  excreted  in  both  the  urine  and  faeces.  There 
were  low  amounts  of  drug  related  material  in  plasma  with  the  major  component  being  parent.  There 
were  3  other  noteworthy  components,  these  were  GSK339067  (M14,  an  O-dealkylated  metabolite), 
GSK1761002  (M33;  a  hydroxylated  metabolite)  and  a  further  metabolite  which  could  not  be  fully 
characterized  but  assigned  as  di-hydroxy  metabolite  based  on  retention  time  alone.  All  metabolites 
were less than 20% of radioactivity present and based on in vitro result; GSK339067 and GSK1761002 
have negligible or equivalent pharmacological activity to UMEC, respectively. 
Based on the initially proposed doses for UMEC (62.5 or 125 mcg) by the IH route, the chemical mass 
of  drug-related  material  in  the  circulation  and  excreta  will  be  low,  with  the  likelihood  of  a  metabolite 
causing unexpected toxicity also being low. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
The human metabolism of VI  was investigated using faecal, urine, plasma and duodenal bile samples 
collected following oral administration of [14C]VI to healthy male subjects in clinical study B2C106181. 
Following  oral  administration,  VI  was  absorbed  then  eliminated  mainly  by  metabolism  followed  by 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 98/308 
 
  
  
excretion of metabolites in urine and faeces (approximately 70% and 30% of the recovered radioactive 
dose,  respectively).  The  main  route  of  metabolism  was  by  O-dealkylation  to  a  range  of  metabolites 
with significantly reduced β1- and β2-agonist activity that included GW630200 and GSK932009. Up to 
78% of the recovered dose (in all excreta) was potentially associated with O-dealkylated metabolites. 
Ndealkylation  (to  M20)  and  C-dealkylation  (to  M26)  were  minor  pathways  in  human  representing  a 
combined  5%  of  the  recovered  dose.  Unchanged  VI  in  human  faeces  (5%  of  the  recovered  oral 
radioactive  dose)  represented  either  unabsorbed  dose  or  absorbed  but  unchanged  VI  (or  conjugate) 
secreted  directly  into  the  GI  tract  or  via  human  bile.  Duodenal  bile  collected  using  the  exploratory 
EnteroTest  device  technique  contained  low  levels  of  radioactivity.  This  may  be  a  reflection  of 
metabolites  being  eliminated  mainly  via  alternative  non-biliary  routes  (e.g.  urine)  or  could  be  due  to 
non-optimal collection of the bile samples or inefficient gall bladder emptying in the subjects. 
The  applicant  states  that  three  independent  pieces  of  data  support  the  hypothesis  that  human 
metabolites of VI make a negligible contribution to its pharmacological effect in man. Firstly, following 
oral administration of [14C]VI (200 mcg) in study B2C106181 plasma concentrations of VI metabolites 
(drug-related material) were significantly higher than VI plasma concentrations and were also likely to 
be considerably greater than plasma concentrations of metabolites produced after administration of the 
therapeutic  inhaled  VI  dose  (25  mcg).  Secondly,  despite  the  higher  metabolite  concentrations,  there 
were no changes in measured vital signs or heart rate which is indicative of a lack of metabolite beta-
adrenoceptor  activity.  Metabolites  representative  of  the  major  human  metabolic  routes,  including 
GW630200  and  GSK932009  have  been  synthesised,  tested  and  shown  to  have  negligible 
pharmacological  activity  against  both  β1-  and  β2-receptors  (study  HR2008/00016/00).  Lastly,  in 
human liver microsome incubations with VI, β2-activity diminished with time in proportion with the loss 
of VI by metabolism indicating that the β2 activity is due to the presence of parent VI. 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
No  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  FDC  umeclidinium  bromide/vilanterol  which  is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Study DB2114635 
Study DB2114635 provides the best available data on the PK of UMEC and VI in healthy subjects when 
administered  as  a  combination  as  well  as  on  dose-proportionality  and  time-dependency  as  this  study 
included repeated dosing and different doses of the combination. This was a randomized, 4-way cross 
over study in healthy subjects and the administered treatments were: 
o  UMEC 500 mcg QD (N=76) 
o  UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg QD (N=78) 
o  UMEC/VI 500/100 mcg QD (N=74) 
o  Moxifloxacin 400 mg QD (N=74) and 
o  Placebo (N=77) 
This  study  is  discussed  in  detail  under  pharmacodynamic  section  as  this  is  a  thorough  QTc  study.

Following  repeat  dosing  of  IH  UMEC,  steady  state  was  achieved  within  7  to  10  days  with  on  average 
1.5- to 2-fold accumulation.  
UMEC was rapidly absorbed with median tmax values occurring at 6 minutes post dose. The terminal 
phase t½ for all subjects was determined using at least 3 data points (range 3–8 points) based on visual 
inspection  and  was  estimated  to  be  on  average  approximately  19  to  25  hours.  Systemic  exposure  of 
UMEC in terms of both AUC(0–t) and Cmax following UMEC/VI 500/100 mcg were approximately dose 
proportional (~4-fold higher) with systemic exposure of UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg.  
The median UMEC concentration-time profile at Day 10 suggest that the PK of UMEC does not appear 
to be affected significantly when administered in a combination with VI. 
Comparison  with  results  from  other  studies  indicate  that  Umeclidinium  systemic  exposure  following 
125 mcg was approximately twice the systemic exposure following 62.5 mcg. 
VI Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
Following  repeat-dose  administration  of  VI  in  combination  with  UMEC,  VI  was  rapidly  absorbed  with 
median tmax values occurring at 6 minutes post dose. The t½ for all subjects was determined using at 
least 3 data points (range 3–7 points) based on visual inspection and was estimated to be on average 
approximately 11 to 19 hours. 
VI  systemic  exposure  in  terms  of  both  AUC(0–t)  and  Cmax  following  UMEC/VI  500/100  mcg  were 
approximately dose proportional (~4-fold higher) with systemic exposure of UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg. 
Selected  VI  PK  parameters  at  Day  10  for  the  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  and  the  UMEC/VI  500/100  mcg

Other  studies  generally  support  the  above  estimates  of  PK  parameters  for  UMEC  and  VI  in  healthy 
subjects.  Although  none  of  the  studies  did  a  formal  comparison  of  steady  state  UMEC  systemic 
exposure when UMEC was administered alone as compared to UMEC/VI, the results shown in the table 
below indicate that there is no significant difference. 
Table 13.  Steady State UMEC PK Following Administration of UMEC Alone (500  mcg) or 
UMEC in Combination with VI (500/25 mcg or 500/100 mcg) 
A  comparison  of  AUC(0-1)  and  Cmax  for  VI  following  the  administration  of  UMEC/VI  500/50  mcg 
versus VI 50 mcg alone was performed. 
The  results  of  the  analysis  showed  no  evidence  of  a  difference  in  VI  Cmax  when  delivered  as  the 
UMEC/VI  500/50  mcg  combination  compared  with  VI  50  mcg  administered  alone.  The  ratio  for  AUC 
showed some evidence of higher exposure (21% (95% CI: 2% to 44%)) in the combination treatment 
arm compared with VI alone. Following repeat dosing of inhaled VI, steady state was achieved within 6 
days with on average 2.4-fold accumulation.

Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
UMEC systemic exposure in terms of steady state Cmax and AUC(0-15) between healthy subjects and 
subjects  with  COPD  were  compared.  Overall,  plasma  data  appear  to  show  somewhat  lower  UMEC 
systemic  exposure  in  subjects  with  COPD  compared  with  healthy  subjects,  and  UMEC  Cmax  and  AUC 
appeared to increase in an approximate dose proportional manner. 
Following repeat dosing, both healthy subjects and subjects with COPD showed an approximately 1.2- 
to 2.9-fold accumulation in UMEC systemic exposure in terms of AUC and Cmax.  
Plasma  elimination  t 1/2  could  not  be  measured  in  many  healthy  subjects  and  subjects  with  COPD 
studies  due  to  limited  sampling,  a  large  number  of  NQ  samples,  and  a  flat  elimination  phase.  Study 
DB2114635 showed that the geometric mean t 1/2 of UMEC in healthy subjects after inhaled dosing was 
26 hours (95% CI: 24, 28 hours; n = 47) for the 500 mcg dose group and 19 hours (95% CI: 13, 29; 
n = 37) following UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg. In COPD patients only urine t 1/2  of UMEC could be calculated 
and this ranged from 6 to 12 hours.  
In  addition  to  systemic  exposure,  apparent  clearances  were  estimated  in  both  the  TQT  study 
(DB2114635) and the pop PK analysis (DB2116975). There were no differences in apparent clearance 
between the two populations. 
Vilanterol 
The pharmacokinetics of VI in subjects with COPD was well described by a three compartment model 
with zero-order absorption. The analysis showed that there was a decrease (27%) in inhaled clearance 
(CL/F)  over  the  observed  age  41  to  84  years.  A  reduction  (47%)  in  CL/F  is  also  predicted  over  the 
bodyweight  range  of  160  to  35  kg  in  subjects  with  COPD.  The  central  volume  (V1/F)  was  found  to 
decrease (30%) with increasing age (41-84 years), to be lower (12%) in females and to be increased 
with  smoking.  Additionally,  the  Phase  II  study  HZC111348  was  a  significant  covariate  on  CL/F  and 
V1/F.  
As  a  result  of  lower  CL/F  and  a  smaller  central  volume  (V1/F),  the  VI  exposure  was  predicted  to  be 
higher  (approximately  1.5-fold  higher  AUC(0-24)  and  2.7-fold  higher  Cmax)  in  the  small  number  of 
subjects  with  COPD  (n=39)  recruited  to  the  Phase  II  study  (study  HZC111348)  compared  with  the 
larger  Phase  IIIa  population  (n=  1052  subjects  with  COPD).  The  reason  for  this  marked  study 
difference is unclear. Despite the higher systemic VI exposure in HZC111348, the FF/VI dose was well 
tolerated and was  not associated with an increase in heart rate (weighted mean 0-4 hours difference 
from  placebo  was  0.6  bpm  [95%  CI:  -3.9  to  5.1]).  Comparison  of  the  model  predicted  VI  systemic 
exposure  (final  model)  showed  no  notable  difference  between  individual  component  versus 
combination treatment.  
Study DB2113120 
This  was  phase  IIa  study  in  COPD  subjects  conducted  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  and 
pharmacodynamics  of  UMEC/VI.  The  dose  administered  was  500/25  mcg once  daily  for  4  weeks.  The 
brief study design is depicted in the below table.

Single and repeat dose administration of 500 mcg GSK573719 in combination with 25 mcg GW642444 
showed  rapid  absorption  of  both  drugs  following  which  plasma  concentrations  quickly  declined 
indicating  rapid  distribution  and  elimination.  There  were  no  evidences  of  accumulation  based on  both 
GSK573719  Cmax  and  AUC  comparisons  except  Cmax  comparison  of  Day  14  versus  Day  1.  The 
observed mean accumulation of Cmax for Day 14 versus Day 1 was 38% (90% CI: 6%, 80%). There 
were  no  evidences  of  accumulation  based  on  both  GW642444  Cmax  and  AUC  comparisons  except 
Cmax  comparison  of  Day  14  versus  Day  1.  The  observed  mean  accumulation  of  Cmax  for  Day  14 
versus Day 1 was 31% (90% CI: 5%, 63%). 
Based  on  the  results  from  study  DB2113120  and  a  cross-study  comparison,  the  PK  of  UMEC  and  VI 
were  similar  when  administered  as  a  combination  compared  with  administration  as  monotherapies, 
demonstrating  a  lack  of  a  drug-drug  interaction  between  UMEC  and  VI.  There  was  modest 
accumulation based on both UMEC Cmax and AUC comparisons (1.4-fold higher systemic exposure at 
Day 14 and a 1.1- to 1.3-fold higher systemic exposure at Day 28 compared with Day 1). There was 
no  evidence  of  marked  accumulation  based on  both  VI  Cmax  and  AUC  comparisons.  At  the  proposed 
doses  of  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  and  125/25  mcg,  UMEC  systemic  exposure  was  dose  proportional  in 
subjects with COPD. None of the subject demographic or baseline characteristics (age, weight, gender, 
race, inhaled corticosteroid use, baseline FEV1, creatinine clearance, and smoking status) had clinically 
relevant  effects  on  UMEC  or  VI  systemic  exposure  to  warrant  dose  adjustment  based  on  these 
covariates. 
Renal impairment 
For  both  UMEC  and  VI  the  primary  route  of  elimination  following  inhaled  dosing  is  via  the  hepatic 
route, primarily through biliary secretion and metabolism for UMEC and through metabolism, primarily 
by CYP450 3A4 for VI. However, even for compounds that are eliminated mainly by the hepatic route, 
there  remains  a  possibility  that  systemic  exposure  may  be  altered  in  subjects  with  impaired  renal 
function  and  so  the  applicant  has  evaluated  the  changes  in  systemic  exposure  of  UMEC  and/or  VI  in 
subjects with impaired renal function in Study DB2114636 (UMEC and UMEC/VI) and study HZA113970 
(VI).  
Study  DB2114636  was  a  single-blind,  non-randomized,  single-dose  study  to  investigate  the  PK  and 
safety of UMEC alone (125 mcg) and UMEC/VI (125/25 mcg) in subjects with severe renal impairment 
compared with healthy subjects.

Following  administration  of  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg,  there  was  no  evidence  of  a  clinically  relevant 
increase  in  UMEC  plasma  exposure  (AUC(0–2)  or  Cmax)  for  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment 
compared with healthy controls. 
On average Ae(0–24) was 89% (90% CI: 81%, 93%) lower in subjects with severe renal impairment 
compared with healthy subjects for UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg. There was no effect of renal impairment on 
urine  t1/2  (healthy  subjects:  11.34  hours  (95%  CI  7.58,  16.97);  subjects  with  severe  renal 
impairment: 9.22 hours (95% CI: 6.54, 12.99). 
Vilanterol 
Summary statistics of plasm VI pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below. 
Following dosing with UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg, there was no evidence of a clinically relevant increase in 
VI plasma exposure for subjects with severe renal impairment compared with healthy subjects. 
Neither  UMEC  125  mcg  nor  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  administered  to  subjects  with  severe  renal 
impairment  resulted  in  clinically  significant  increases  in  either  UMEC  or  VI  systemic  exposure. 
Therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with impaired renal function.

Hepatic impairment 
The  hepatic  route  has  been  determined  as  the  major  route  of  elimination  of  UMEC.  Following 
intravenous  administration  of  (14C)-UMEC,  58%  of  total  radioactivity  was  recovered  in  the  feces, 
suggesting  biliary  secretion.  In  addition,  results  from  in  vitro  studies  indicated  that  UMEC  is  a 
metabolic  substrate  for  the  CYP2D6  isozyme,  which  may  contribute  to  its  clearance.  VI  is  rapidly 
cleared  by  extensive  first  pass  metabolism  mediated  by  the  P450  isozyme  CYP3A4.  Hence  there  is  a 
distinct possibility that PK of UMEC and/or VI may be changed in patients with impaired liver function. 
Two studies, study DB2114637 (UMEC and UMEC/VI) and study HZA111789 (VI) have been conducted 
in subjects with hepatic impairment to address this issue.  
Study DB2114637 was an open-label, non-randomized study to investigate the PK and safety of single- 
and  repeat-doses  of  UMEC  alone  (125  mcg)  and  a  single  dose  of  UMEC/VI  (125/25  mcg)  in  subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects. Hepatically impaired subjects were 
classified  using  the  Child-Pugh  classification  –moderate:  Child-Pugh  B  (7  to  9  points).  Nine  subjects 
with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  were  enrolled  along  with  9  matched  healthy  control  subjects.  All 
subjects  received  a  single  dose  of  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg,  followed  by  a  7-  to  14-day  washout  and  a 
subsequent second treatment period with UMEC 125 mcg once-daily for 7 days.

Following  single-dose  administration  of  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg,  plasma  UMEC  exposures  were  on 
average lower in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Following  single-dose  administration  of  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg,  urinary  excretion  of  UMEC  was,  on 
average, lower in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects.

Following single-dose administration of UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg, VI systemic exposures were on average 
lower in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects. 
Both  UMEC  125  mcg  and  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  administered  to  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic 
impairment  led  to  UMEC  and  VI  systemic  exposures  that  were  on  average  lower  in  the  subjects  with 
moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects and no dose adjustment is recommended 
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. UMEC/VI has not been studied in subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Gender 
Population PK analyses showed that gender is not a significant covariate in the PK of UMEC or VI and 
hence  dose  adjustments  are  not  warranted  based  on  gender.  A  specific  PK  study  has  not  been 
conducted to evaluate a difference in PK due to gender and such a study is not required. The available 
PK data and the population PK analyses are reassuring that gender is not a significant factor in the PK 
of UMEC or VI. 
Race 
No  specific  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  race  on  PK  or  PD  parameters.  Several 
studies were conducted solely in Japanese healthy subjects and the PK data from studies in Japanese 
subjects are discussed below. 
Population PK datasets for both UMEC (n=1635) and VI (n=1637) were evaluated for an effect of race 
on the PK of UMEC and VI.  
This  population  PK  analysis  did  not  show  any  racial  differences  in  apparent  clearance  or  volume  of 
distribution for UMEC or VI. 
Weight 
In  the  population  PK  analyses,  weight  was  found  to  be  a  significant  covariate  of  apparent  inhaled 
clearance  of  both  UMEC  &  VI,  and  weight  was  also  a  significant  covariate  of  apparent  volume  of 
distribution of UMEC. The analyses however demonstrated that the effect of weight on PK is marginal 
and no dose adjustment is warranted based on weight from the final PK model. 
Though  changes  in  weight  affect  the  PK  of  UMEC  and  VI,  it  is  accepted  that  the  changes  are  not 
clinically significant to recommend any changes in dose based on weight.

In  the  population  PK  analyses,  age  was  found  to  be  a  significant  covariate  of  apparent  inhaled 
clearance  of  both  UMEC  and  VI.  The  analyses  however  demonstrated  that  the  effect  of  age  on  PK  is 
marginal and no dose adjustment is warranted based on age from the final PK model. 
It is accepted that despite the observation the change in age may affect the PK of UMEC and VI, 
dosage adjustment based on age are not required. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Umeclidinium bromide 
In  vitro  studies  conducted  using  human  recombinant  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  enzymes  showed  that 
UMEC  was  metabolized  mainly  by  CYP2D6.  In  a  clinical  study  conducted  in  both  healthy  normal  and 
CYP2D6  poor  metabolizer  subjects  there  was  no  clinically  significant  difference  in  the  systemic  
exposure to UMEC following 7 days repeat dosing with 4- to 8-fold higher supra-therapeutic IH doses. 
No dose adjustment for use of CYP2D6 and UMEC/VI appears to be warranted. 
UMEC  is  an  in  vitro  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  and  CYP2D6  (IC50  values  between  0.1  and  1  microM).  At 
clinical  doses,  the  highest  anticipated  Cmax  in  humans  (<0.2  ng/mL  or  0.5  nM)  is  at  least  200-fold 
lower  than  the  lowest  IC50  value  (0.1  microM)  as  a  worst  case  for  all  CYPs  and  transporters 
investigated. There was no evidence of biologically significant UMEC induction of CYP P450 enzymes in 
a 1 month rat study that used inhaled doses of UMEC up to 2000 mcg/kg/day (approximately 120 mg 
for a 60 kg human). 
Vilanterol 
In-vitro  studies  suggest  that  VI  is  metaboised  primarily  by  CYP3A4.  Co-administration  with  strong 
inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  may  lead  to  increased  exposure  to  VI  (and  other  LABAs)  and  strong  inhibitors 
have  been  contra-indicated  in  clinical  studies.  Clinical  studies  with  moderate  (verapamil)  and  strong 
(ketoconazole) CYP3A4 inhibitors were conducted with the strong inhibitor showing higher VI systemic 
exposure and the moderate inhibitor showing no effect on systemic exposure. 
Vilanterol is an in vitro inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (IC50 values between 3.5 and 12 microM). At 
clinical  doses,  the  highest  anticipated  Cmax  in  humans  (<0.2  ng/mL  or  0.5  nM)  is  at  least  1000-fold 
lower than the lowest IC50 value (3.5 microM) (equivalent to 1.6 mcg/mL) as a worst case for all CYPs 
and  transporters  investigated.  There  was  no  evidence  of  biologically  significant  VI  induction  of  CYP 
P450 enzymes in a 14-day rat study that used IH doses up to 32,900 mcg/kg/day (approximately 1974 
mg for a 60 kg human). 
Therefore the inhibition potential and induction potential of UMEC and/or VI on CYP P450 enzymes at 
low clinical IH doses is considered to be negligible. 
In vivo 
Umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol 
Three studies (DB2114365, DB2113208 and DB2113950) provide information on this aspect.  
Study DB2114635 
Study DB2114635 was a thorough QT study which also included PK evaluation. Summary statistics of 
UMEC 500 mcg and UMEC/VI 500/50 mcg are provided in the below table.

Table 14.  Summary Statistics of Day 10 UMEC PK Parameters (DB2114635) 
UMEC systemic exposure following UMEC 500 mcg was similar or slightly higher than UMEC systemic 
exposure following UMEC/VI 500/100 mcg in terms of Cmax and AUC. 
The above results indicate that the systemic exposure of UMEC was comparable or slightly higher when 
UMEC was administered alone as compared to when it is administered as UMEC/VI.  
Study DB2113950 
This was a randomized, open label study in healthy subjects to evaluate the PK of UMEC/VI and UMEC 
alone  when  administered  concomitantly  with  verapamil  (240mg).  Verapamil,  a  moderate  CYP3A4 
inhibitor  and  potent  P-gp  inhibitor  is  one  of  the  drugs  frequently  used  by  subjects  with  COPD  as  a 
result of co-morbidities such as hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. 
The study consisted of 2 treatment sequences: 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  effect  of  verapamil  240  mg  qd  on  the  steady  state  PK  of 
inhaled  UMEC  and  UMEC/VI.  In  the  period  one  of  two  cohorts,  when  verapamil  was  not  administered 
concomitantly, the results can be used to compare the effect of combination of VI on the PK of UMEC.  
UMEC pharmacokinetics 
Summary statistics of Day 8 UMEC plasma PK parameters following UMEC monotherapy and following 
UMEC/VI are presented in the below table.

On  average,  steady  state  plasma  systemic  exposure  of  UMEC  was  comparable  when  administered  as 
UMEC alone compared with UMEC/VI, with overlapping 95% CIs. This suggests a lack of PK interaction 
between UMEC and VI. 
The  above  results  indicate  that  the  systemic  exposure  of  UMEC  was  comparable  when  UMEC  was 
administered alone as compared to when it is administered as UMEC/VI. Taking the overall results from 
this  study  and  study  DB2114635,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  exposure  of  UMEC  is  not  affected  by 
combining it with VI.  
UMEC exposure in terms of AUC was approximately 40% higher in the presence of verapamil, however 
this was not considered clinically relevant. There was no effect of verapamil on the Cmax of UMEC.  
UMEC exposure in terms of AUC was approximately 40% higher in the presence of verapamil, however

Following  a  single  dose  administration  of  either  GW642444  alone  or  combination  of  GSK573719  and 
GW642444,  GW642444  was  rapidly  absorbed  with  most  of  the  Cmax  values  occurring  at  5  min 
following which plasma concentrations declined rapidly. 
For  GSK573719,  Cmax  indicated  that  the  combination  treatment  arm  gave  higher  systemic  exposure 
than  GSK573719  alone.  On  the  other  hand,  the  treatment  ratio  for  AUC  parameters  provided  no 
evidence of a difference. For GW642444, there was no evidence of a difference in GW642444 systemic 
exposure  when  delivered  as  GSK573719  500  µg  and  GW642444  50  µg  combination  compared  with 
GW642444  alone  for  Cmax.  However  AUC  parameters  indicated  that  the  combination  treatment  arm 
gave higher systemic exposure than GW642444 alone. 
In  addition  to  the  above  studies,  two  other  studies  (study  HZA105548  and  study  B2C112205) 
evaluated the effects of ketoconazle, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a potent P-gp inhibitor on the PK of 
VI.  
Ketoconazole  co-administration  increased  VI  AUC(0-t’)  and  Cmax  on  average  by  65%  and  22%, 
respectively.

Anoro  is  a  combination  of  two  different  medicines:  umeclidinium  bromide  (UMEC)  and  vilanterol 
trifenatate (VI). 
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
Umeclidinium is a long acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (also referred to as an anticholinergic). It 
is  a  quinuclidine  derivative  with  activity  across  multiple  muscarinic  receptor  subtypes.  Umeclidinium 
exerts  its  bronchodilatory  activity  by  competitively  inhibiting  the  binding  of  acetylcholine  with 
muscarinic  receptors  on  airway  smooth  muscle.  It  demonstrates  slow  reversibility  at  the  human  M3 
muscarinic receptor subtype in vitro and a long duration of action in vivo when administered directly to 
the lungs in pre-clinical models. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Vilanterol  trifenatate  is  a  selective  long-acting,  beta2  adrenergic  agonist  (LABA).  The  pharmacologic 
effects  of  beta2  adrenoceptor  agonist  drugs,  including  vilanterol  trifenatate,  are  at  least  in  part 
attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion 
of  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP)  to  cyclic-3’,5’-adenosine  monophosphate  (cyclic  AMP).  Increased 
cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of 
immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Minimal  primary  pharmacology  data  was  collected  as  bronchodilatory  effect  of  treatments  are  best 
assessed  in  patients  with  impaired  lung  function  (asthma  or  COPD).  In  healthy  volunteers,  specific 
airway  conductance  (sGaw)  was  selected  as  a  sensitive  measure  for  the  PD  effect.  Most  of  these 
studies  were  with  monocomponents  and  are  not  discussed  here.  Only  one  study,  study  DB2113208 
was  conducted  with  the  combination  of  UMEC/VI  and  this  study  used  FEV1  as  the  PD  endpoint.  This 
study is discussed below under secondary pharmacology.  
Umeclidinium bromide (GSK573719) 
Study  AC4113073  evaluated  doses  of  62.5,  125,  250,  500,  and  1000  mcg  once-daily  and  62.5,  125, 
and  250  mcg  twice-daily  for  14  days  using  an  incomplete  block  crossover  design.  Study  AC4115321 
was of similar design to study AC4113073 with 15.6, 31.25, 62.5, and 125 mcg once-daily as well as 
15.6 mcg and 31.25 mcg twice-daily given for 7 days. Population model-based dose response analyses 
were  performed  for  individual  studies.  In  addition,  an  integrated  model-based  pooled  analysis  of  the 
data from both studies was undertaken. 
A  physiological  maximum  effect  (Emax)  model  adequately  characterized  the  dose-trough  FEV1 
response for UMEC over the once-daily dose range of 15.6 to 1000 mcg, with an estimated dose that 
would  yield  50%  of  Emax  (ED50)  of  33  mcg  (95%  CI:  25  -  41)  with  a  predicted  maximum  effect 
[Emax] for trough FEV1 of 187 ml [95% CI (170, 210]. The once-daily proposed UMEC doses of 62.5 
mcg and 125 mcg have shown dose related increases in trough FEV1. There was no marked difference 
between  the  once-  versus  twice-daily  regimen  of  the  same  total  daily  dose  for  UMEC.  This  translates

into UMEC 33 mcg providing 50% of the maximum trough FEV1 effect compared with 30% for the 15.6 
mcg dose, 46% for the 31.25 mcg dose, 63% for the 62.5 mcg dose and 77% for the 125 mcg UMEC 
dose.  Further  the  results  indicate  no  advantage  of  a  twice-daily  dosing  interval  over  a  once-daily 
dosing of UMEC 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
A  population  dose-response  relationship  between  once-daily  doses  of  VI  (3,  6.25,  12.5,  25,  and  50 
mcg)  and  mean  change  from  Baseline  trough  (pre-bronchodilator  and predose)  FEV1  was  established 
in subjects with COPD (study B2C111045). 
A physiological Emax model supports VI as a potent bronchodilator (ED50 = 12.8 mcg [95% CI: 7.4, 
18.2] with a predicted Emax for trough FEV1 of 167 mL [95% CI: 106, 228]). This translates into VI 
12.5 mcg providing 49% of the maximum trough FEV1 effect, compared with 66% for VI 25 mcg and 
80% for VI 50 mcg. 
Study DB2113208 
This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, four way cross over study to assess the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacodynamics  and  pharmacokinetics  of  single  inhaled  doses  of  UMEC  and  VI  as  mono-therapies 
and concurrently in healthy Japanese subjects.  The pharmacodynamic results of this study are given 
below.  
For minimum blood potassium (0-4 h), the comparison of UMEC 500 µg and VI 50 µg versus UMEC 500 
µg  showed  the  greatest  mean  decrease  of  -0.17  mmol/L  (95%  CI:-0.27,  -0.07).  This  large  decrease 
may  have  been  influenced  by  the  average  increases  that  were  observed  for  UMEC  only.  The 
comparison  of  UMEC  500  µg  versus  placebo  showed  an  increase.  For  other  comparisons  95%  CI 
embraced zero. 
For  maximum  HR  (0-4  h),  average  increases  were  observed  for  all  comparisons  relative  to  placebo. 
Similar  effects  were  observed  when  the  GSK573719  500  µg  and  GW642444  50  µg  combination  was 
compared with each monotherapy, indicating that co administration does not alter the effect of either 
compound on heart rate parameters. 
FEV1  values  were  higher  for  all  treatment  groups  compared  with  placebo.  The  combination  group 
showed  the  largest  difference  relative  to  placebo  with  FEV1  peaking  up  at  6  h  with  difference  in 
adjusted mean [95% CI of 287 mL (14 mL, 560 mL)]. 
QTc(B)  and  QTc(F)  (0-4  h)  showed  a  small  differences  for  the  comparisons  of  GSK573719  versus 
placebo  and  combination  versus  GW642444).  Increases  in  QTc  parameters  were  observed  for 
GW642444  relative  to  placebo.  The  average  effect  of  the  combination  relative  to  placebo  was  larger 
than the effect of GW642444 alone. However this effect was not seen in the weighted mean analysis, 
where the effect of combination therapy lay between those of GSK573719 alone and GW642444 alone. 
For blood potassium, an average decreases were observed for GW642444 and combination (treatment 
groups containing GW642444) versus placebo. Average increase was observed for GSK573719 versus 
placebo. A larger decrease was seen for the combination relative to GSK573719 500 µg alone than was 
seen for the combination relative to placebo. This was driven by the increase observed for GSK573719. 
There were no obvious trends observed between individual change in maximum HR and GSK573719 or 
GW642444  Cmax  when  administered  as  GSK573719  500  μg/GW642444  50  µg  concurrently  or  as 
GSK573719 or GW642444 administered alone.

Study DB2113950 
This  was  a  drug-drug  interaction  study  with  verapamil  and  this  study  also  evaluated  the 
pharmacodynamic effects of the combination UMEC/VI.  
There were no clinically significant vital signs, 12-lead ECG or Holter findings. No subject had a heart 
rate  increase  >40 bpm  from  baseline  or  a  resting heart  rate  >130  bpm.  No subject  had  a  QTc  >500 
msec or an absolute change from baseline >60 msec. 
Statistical analyses of vital signs and ECG parameters are summarised below. 
For  maximum  heart  rate  (0–4  h),  average  changes  were  small  for  all  comparisons  with  and  without 
verapamil.  The  clinical  relevance  of  such  potential  effects  is  to  be  determined  in  the  light  of  the 
expected verapamil effects. 
Values of QTcB and QTcF (0–4 h) showed increases for comparisons that probably highlight the effect 
of verapamil on the ECG. The clinical relevance of such potential effects is to be determined in the light 
of the expected verapamil effects. 
For  blood  potassium,  a  small  decrease  was  observed  with  the  addition  of  verapamil  in  both  cohorts. 
The  clinical  relevance  of  such  potential  effects  is  to  be  determined  in  the  light  of  the  expected 
verapamil effects. 
Blood potassium and blood glucose 
Two studies (B2C108784 in healthy subjects and B2C110165 in COPD patients) evaluated the effect of 
VI on blood potassium and blood glucose. These studies also showed there were no obvious treatment 
differences  on  repeated  dosing  of  VI  100mcg  once  daily  for  14  days.  The  only  positive  treatment 
difference  from  placebo  was  observed  following  the  administration  of  VI  100mcg  which  was 
0.06mmol/L in  healthy  subjects  and  0.32  mmol/L in  COPD  patients  for  the  0-4  hours  weighted  mean 
glucose. The effect of UMEC alone and the effect of UMEC/VI were assessed in studies DB2113208 and 
DB2113950 and these studies also showed no significant effect on poatassium or glucose. 
Thorough QTc study (DB2114635)  
A thorough QTc study was conducted to evaluate the effect of UMEC/VI on QT prolongation. This was a 
randomized,  placebo-controlled,  10-day  repeat  dose,  4-period,  incomplete  block  study  in  healthy 
subjects.  The  treatments  tested  were  Placebo,  Moxifloxacin  400mg  dose,  UMEC  500mcg 
(supratherapeutic  dose),  UMEC/VI  125/25  therapeutic  dose  and  UMEC/VI  500/100  (supratherapeutic 
dose).  
A summary of point estimates and 90% CIs for the adjusted mean difference from placebo in change 
from baseline QTcF for the comparison of interest is given in the table below.

Table 19.  Results  of  Statistical  Analysis  of  Mean  Change  from  Baseline  for  QTc(F)  on 
Day 10 (Manually Read ECGs) (All Subjects Population – DB2114635) 
Single-dose  oral  moxifloxacin  400  mg  (positive  control)  demonstrated  assay  sensitivity  with  mean 
increases  in  time-matched  QTc(F)  compared  with  placebo  greater  than  5  msec  at  1,  2,  4,  8  and  12 
hours after dosing. The upper 90% CI exceeded 10 msec at 4 and 8 hours. 
The  study  was  negative  for  UMEC  and  UMEC/VI  at  therapeutic  doses  in  that  the  adjusted  mean 
treatment  difference  did  not  exceed  5  msec,  and  the  upper  bound  of  the  90%  CI  for  the  estimated 
treatment difference did not exceed 10 msec at any time point out to 24 hours after dosing. 
At  the  supra-therapeutic  dose  of  UMEC/VI  (500/100),  there  was  evidence  of  an  effect  on  QTc  during 
the first hour after dosing. The time-matched difference from placebo exceeded 5 msec at 10 min and 
30 min post-dose. The 90% CI exceeded 10 msec only at the 30 min timepoint. 
Heart-rate 
Repeat-dose  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  and  500/100  mcg  for  10  days  resulted  in  a  maximum  increase  in 
time-matched  heart  rate  (mean  change  from  baseline)  compared  with  placebo  of  8.4  bpm  (90%  CI: 
7.0,  9.8)  and  20.3  bpm  (90%  CI:  18.9,  21.7),  respectively;  both  were  at  10  minutes  after  dosing. 
Heart rates rapidly declined after these maximum differences. 
Blood pressure 
The  effects  of  UMEC  and  VI  on  BP  were  evaluated  in  monocomponent  studies.  In  these  studies,  at 
therapeutic doses there was no significant effect of UMEC or VI on blood pressure. However UMEC at

1000mcg and VI at 100 mcg showed an increase in systolic and diastolic BP of around 3 mm Hg, which 
were not clinically significant.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  absolute  bioavailability  for  umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol  when  administered  by  inhlation 
was on average 12.8 % and 27.3 % respectively. The oral bioavailability of both umeclidinium bromide 
and  vilanterol  was  low,  on  average  <  1%  and  < 2 %  respectively.  Given  this  low  oral  bioavailability, 
systemic exposure for umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol following inhaled administration is primarily 
due to absorption of the inhaled portion of the dose delivered to the lung. 
Following  intravenous  dosing,  both  umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol  are  extensively  distributed 
with  average  volumes  of  distribution  at  steady  state  of  86.2  L  and  165  L,  respectively.  Both 
umeclidinium and vilanterol have a low association with red blood cells. In vitro plasma protein binding 
in  human  plasma  of  umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol  was  moderate  and  high,  respectively. 
Umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol  are  both  substrate  for  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp),  however 
concomitant  administration  of  umeclidinium  bromide/vilanterol  with  P-gp  inhibitors  is  considered 
unlikely to alter umeclidinium bromide or vilanterol systemic exposure.  
Based  on  in  vitro  data,  the  major  routes  of  metabolism  of  umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol  in 
human are mediated primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP34A, respectively. Umeclidinium bromide is primarily 
metabolised  through  oxidation  (hydroxylation,  O-dealkylation)  and  conjugation  to  a  range  of 
metabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity or for which the pharmacological activity has 
not  been  established.  Vilanterol  is  primarily  metabolised  by  O  dealkylation  to  a  range  of  metabolites 
with significantly reduced β1- and β2-agonist activity. 
Following  oral  administration,  umeclidinium  bromide  was  eliminated  in  human  mainly  by  metabolism 
and  excreted  in  the  faeces,  with  <  1  %  of  the  recovered  radioactivity  dose  eliminated  in  the  urine. 
Following oral administration, vilanterol was eliminated mainly by metabolism followed by excretion of 
metabolites in urine and faeces approximately 70% and 30% of the radioactive dose respectively in a 
human radiolabel study conducted by the oral route.  
The  effects  of  age  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  umeclidinium  and  vilanterol  were  determined  in 
population  PK  analyses.  The  analyses  however  demonstated  that  the  effect  of  age  on  PK  is  marginal 
and that no dose adjustement is warranted for elderly patients. 
A clinical pharmacology study of umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol showed that severe renal impairment 
did  not  result  in  significantly  greater  exposure  to  umeclidinium  bromide  or  vilanterol  compared  with 
healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is therefore required for patients with renal impairment. 
Following repeat dosing of umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol for 7 days, there was a slight decrease in 
umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol  exposure  in  subject  with  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  B) 
compared  with  healthy  subjects.  Therefore  no  dose  adjustement  is  recommended  for  patients  with 
moderate  hepatic  impairment.  Umeclidinium  bromide/vilanterol  FDC  has  not  been  studies  in  patients 
with  severe  hepatic  impairment  and  should  be  used  with  caution  as  described  in  the  product 
information. 
There  was  no  evidence  for  age,  race,  gender,  weight  or  BMI  (body  mass  index)  to  influence  the 
pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol based on population PK analyses. Therefore 
no dose adjustement is recommended based on race, gender, weight or BMI.

Three  studies  were  conducted  which  allowed  for  the  evaluation  of  a  potential  PK  interaction  between 
UMEC  and  VI  (study  DB2114635,  study  DB2113208,  and  study  DB2113950),  as  well  as  results  from 
the  Population  PK  analysis.  These  studies  and  the  Population  PK  analysis  showed  no  difference  in  PK 
parameters when UMEC or VI was administered as monotherapy compared with when administered in 
combination, thereby indicating a lack of a PK interaction between UMEC and VI. 
In vitro studies conducted using human recombinant CYP enzymes showed that UMEC was metabolized 
principally by CYP2D6. In a clinical study conducted in healthy normal metabolizer subjects and healthy 
CYP2D6  poor  metabolizer  subjects,  there  was  no  clinically  significant  difference  in  the  systemic 
exposure  to  UMEC  following  7  days  of  repeat  dosing  with  IH  doses  up  to  1000  mcg.  No  dose 
adjustment is recommended in patients using concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitors or subjects with genetic 
polymorphisms of CYP2D6 metabolism. 
Based  on  in  vitro  data,  the  major  routes  of  metabolism  of  VI  in  humans  are  mediated  primarily  by 
CYP3A4.  Concomitant  administration  of  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  may  inhibit  the  metabolism  of,  and 
increase the systemic exposure to, vilanterol. Co-administration with ketoconazole (400 mg) in healthy 
volunteers  increased  mean  vilanterol  AUC(0-t)  and  Cmax,  65%  and  22%  respectively.  The  increase  in 
vilanterol  exposure  was  not  associated  with  an  increase  in  beta-adrenergic  agonist  related  systemic 
effects on heart rate, blood potassium or QT interval (corrected using the Fridericia method). Caution 
is  advised  when  co-administering  umeclidinium/vilanterol  with  ketoconazole  and  other  known  strong 
CYP3A4  inhibitors  as  there  is  potential  for  an  increased  systemic  exposure  to  vilanterol.  Verapamil,  a 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of vilanterol. 
Both  UMEC  and  VI  are  substrates of  P-gp.  In  a  clinical  study  conducted in  healthy  subjects  where  IH 
UMEC and VI were co-administered with verapamil, a potent inhibitor of P-gp and moderate inhibitor of 
CYP3A4,  there  was  no  effect  of  verapamil  on  UMEC  Cmax,  VI  Cmax,  or  VI  AUC  and  only  a  moderate 
increase (1.4-fold) in AUC for UMEC. 
The  applicant  conducted  interaction  studies  to  identify  the  clinically  significant  interactions  between 
UMEC and VI when used as fixed dose combination product. In general the CHMP agreed that there are 
no  major  concerns  on  the  pharmacokinetics.  However  there  are  some  aspects  of  the  metabolism  of 
UMEC and VI that are not yet completely understood and additional in-vitro studies may provide some 
useful answers. The applicant will, as requested by the CHMP, conduct the following in-vitro studies:

as additional Pharmacovigilance activities as described in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  
Pharmacodynamics 
Anoro  is  a  combination  of  two  active  ingredients,  umeclidinium  bromide,  a  LAMA  and  vilanterol 
trifenatate,  a  LABA.  Both  compounds  act  locally  on  airways  to  produce  bronchodilation  by  separate 
mechanisms. Umeclidinium exerts its bronchodilatory activity by competitively inhibiting the binding of 
acetylcholine with muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle. The activity of vilanterol is mediated 
through 
increased  cyclic  AMP 
levels,  which  cause  relaxation  of  bronchial  smooth  muscle 
(bronchodilatory effect) and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, 
especially from mast cells.

The primary and secondary pharmacology parameters studied in the clinical development of UMEC/VI 
included  all  the  well  characterised  and  reported  PD  effects  of  LAMAs  and  LABAs.  The  three  studies 
discussed  under  pharmacokinetics  (study  DB2114635  –  thorough  QTc  study,  Study  DB2113950  – 
verapamil interaction study and Study DB2113208 – PK study in Japanese subjects) also evaluated the 
pharmacodynamics of the combination. In addition there were other studies which evaluated the PD of 
the individual components which are considered supportive of the PD actions of UMEC/VI.  
All the relevant clinical data generated have been used in modelling to predict concentration dependent 
effects and to plot dose-response curves. For the primary pharmacology effect of bronchodilation, the 
effects of UMEC and VI on trough FEV1 have been modelled and relevant parameters like Emax, ED50 
and  %age  maximal  response  at  a  proposed  dose  have  been  calculated.  However  while  the  dose-
response effects of the individual components have been well characterised, the dose-response effect 
of the fixed dose combination of UMEC/VI have not been characterised.  
The effects of UMEC and VI on the generally anticipated pharmacodynamic effects have been studied. 
Clinically  significant  secondary  pharmacology  effects  like  heart  rate,  blood  potassium,  blood  glucose 
and ECG effects (particularly effect on QTc) were generally not seen at the therapeutic concentrations.  
The  effect  of  umeclidinium/vilanterol  on  the  QT  interval  was  evaluated  in  a  placebo  and  active 
(moxifloxacin)  controlled  QT  study  involving  once  daily  administration  of  umeclidinium/vilanterol 
113/22 micrograms or 500/100 micrograms (pre-dispensed dose with umeclidinium at eight times the 
recommended  dose  and  vilanterol  at  four  times  the  recommended  dose)  for  10  days  in  103  healthy 
volunteers. The maximum mean difference in prolongations of QT interval from placebo after baseline-
correction  was  4.3  (90%  CI=2.2  to  6.4)  milliseconds  seen  10  minutes  after  administration  with 
umeclidinium/vilanterol  113/22 micrograms  and  8.2  (90%  CI=6.2  to  10.2)  milliseconds  seen  30 
minutes after administration with umeclidinium/vilanterol 500/100 micrograms. Therefore, no clinically 
relevant  pro-arrhythmic  potential  related 
to  QT-interval  prolongations  was  observed  with 
umeclidinium/vilanterol 113/22 micrograms. 
A  dose-dependent  increase  in  heart  rate  was  also  observed.  The  maximum  mean  difference  in  heart 
rate from placebo after baseline-correction was 8.4 (90% CI=7.0 to 9.8) beats/minute and 20.3 (90% 
CI=18.9 to 21.7)  beats/minute  seen  10  minutes  after  administration  of  umeclidinium/vilanterol 
113/22 micrograms and 500/100 micrograms respectively.  
In  addition,  no  clinically  significant  effects  on  cardiac  rhythm  were  observed  on  24-hour  Holter 
monitoring in 53 patients with COPD who were treated with umeclidinium/vilanterol 55/22 micrograms 
once  daily  in  one  6-month  study,  or  in  a  further  55 patients  who  received  umeclidinium/vilanterol 
113/22 micrograms  once  daily 
in  another  6-month  study  and  226 patients  who  received 
113/22 micrograms once daily in the 12-month study. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of the umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol FDC has been well documented. 
UMEC/VI  has  a  pharmacokinetic  profile  with  low  potential  for  interactions  due  to  the  low  plasma 
concentration achieved after inhaled dosing. Exposure differences based on gender, age, weight, race, 
renal  impairment  and  mild  hepatic  impairment  were  estimated  and  were  not  considered  clinically 
relevant. UMEC/VI FDC has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be 
used with caution as described in the product information. As some aspects of the metabolism of UMEC 
and  VI  that  are  not  yet  completely  characterised,  the  applicant  will  conduct  a  number  of  in-vitro 
studies as additional Pharmacovigilance activities as described in the RMP.  
The  pharmacodynamics  of  UMEC/VI  indicates  that  this  combination  is  potentially  effective  in  the 
treatment  of  COPD.  The  pharmacodynamics  of  UMEC/VI  is  considered  to  be  adequately  characterised

by the studies performed in phase I and II. The results of these studies are appropriately reflected in 
the SmPC.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
There  are  3  main  dose-finding  studies  for  UMEC  and  one  main  dose-finding  study  for  VI  in  COPD 
patients.  There  are  2  other  dose-finding  (and  dose-frequency)  studies  of  VI  in  asthma  which  is  the 
basis  for  the  selection  of  dose  of  VI  in  COPD.  No  dose-finding  studies  with  the  umeclidinium 
bromide/vilanterol FDC were submitted. 
The  key  studies  supporting  choice  of  dose  and  dose  interval  and  comparing  morning  and  evening 
dosing are shown in the table below.

Three studies, all in COPD patients, evaluated UMEC doses ranging from 15.6 mcg once daily to 1000 
mcg once daily. One study (study AC113589) was a placebo controlled 28-day study evaluating doses 
125 mcg, 250 mcg and 500 mcg of UMEC. The second and third studies were dose-ranging and dose-
interval  finding  studies,  both  placebo-controlled.  One  study  (study  AC4113073),  of  14  days  duration 
evaluated  doses  of  UMEC  62.5,  125,  250,  500  and  1000  mcg  in  comparison  to  Tiotropium  18  mcg 
given  once  daily  and  UMEC  doses  62.5,  125  and  250  mcg  given  twice  daily  as  well.  The  other  study 
(study AC4115321), of 7 days duration, evaluated the UMEC doses of 15.6, 31.25, 62.5, and 125 mcg 
in comparison to Tiotropium given once daily and UMEC doses of 15.6 and 31.25 given twice daily. 
Across these studies, doses of 62.5 and 125 mcg once-daily provided improvements in trough FEV1 at 
or  near  the  level  offered  by  higher  doses,  with  safety  profiles  that  were  comparable  to  placebo.  At 
doses  of  250  mcg  and  above,  AEs  were  more  common.  The  additional  increase  in  trough  FEV1  with 
doses above 125 mcg was not considered to provide sufficient benefit to offset the increase in Aes. 
The  dose  response  model  incorporating  data  from  the  two  crossover  studies  suggests  that  doses  of 
62.5  and  125  mcg  produce  63%  and  77%  of  the  maximal  predicted  response  on  trough  FEV1 
compared to 30% for the 15.6 mcg dose and 46% for the 31.25 mcg dose. 
In addition study AC4115408 a 12 week ‘efficacy and safety’  phase III study in COPD patients, which 
evaluated both 125 mcg and 62.5 mcg doses in comparison to placebo, provides supporting evidence 
for the doses of UMEC selected. This study demonstrated both 62.5 and 125 mcg doses were effective 
over 12 weeks and showed a separation in efficacy between these doses as observed in Phase IIb. 
A summary of trough FEV1 (primary endpoint) findings from the Phase IIb studies and AC4115408 is 
shown in the table below. These studies also support that the steady state pharmacodynamic effect of 
UMEC is observed after 7 days of treatment.

The  evaluations  of  once-  and  twice-daily  dosing  in the  Phase  IIb  studies  AC4115321  and  AC4113073 
provide substantial evidence to support a once-daily dosing interval for UMEC. In these studies, once-
daily doses of UMEC were administered in the morning and twice-daily doses were administered in the 
morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart.  
To  maintain  blinding,  a  double-dummy  design  was  used  where  subjects  using  once-daily  treatments 
took placebo in the evening.

In  both  studies,  the  24  hour  serial  FEV1  response  profiles  with  once-daily  dosing  showed  consistent 
improvements in FEV1 relative to placebo over 24 hours and twice-daily dosing of UMEC at the same 
nominal dose did not provide greater benefit over once-daily dosing in the later 12 hours of the dosing 
interval. Notably, administration of a second dose of UMEC at 12 hours following the morning dose did 
not  result  in  an  appreciable  change  in  FEV1  in  the  subsequent  12  hours.  Furthermore,  the 
improvements in FEV1 from placebo observed at time points over the first 12 hours were maintained at 
time points over the second 12 hours with UMEC once-daily (see figure below). This is reflected in the 
ratios  for  the  difference  from  placebo  in  0  to  12  hour  FEV1  weighted  mean  values  obtained  after  PM 
dosing over those obtained after AM dosing which showed comparable results for both dosing regimens 
thereby supporting the effectiveness of once daily administration for UMEC.

Two  28  days  studies,  one  in  asthma  (study  B2C109575)  and  the  other  in  COPD  (study  B2C111045) 
evaluated the dose-related increase in FEV1 over the dose-range of 3, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 mcg. An 
additional study in asthma (study HZA113310) supports these findings over a 7 day treatment period. 
Since  an  asthma  population  is  highly  responsive  to  beta-agonist  bronchodilation,  the  dose  response 
(study B2C109575) and dosing interval findings (study HZA113310) conducted in subjects with asthma 
provide supportive information for VI in COPD. 
Study B2C111045 clearly demonstrated that the 25 and 50 mcg doses of VI are more efficacious than 
doses of 3, 6.25, and 12.5 mcg. Compared with placebo, clinically meaningful differences of ≥0.1 L in 
trough FEV1 were observed on Day 29 with the 12.5, 25, and 50 mcg doses, while differences of ≥0.13 
L  were  observed  only  with  the  25  mcg  and  50  mcg  doses.  A  Bayesian  analysis  of  the  change  from 
baseline  in  trough  FEV1  demonstrated  that  the  probabilities  of  having  a  true  treatment  difference  of 
>0.1  L  over  placebo  were  more than  90%  with  both  the  25  mcg  and  50  mcg  doses,  but  much  lower 
(<64%) for the 3, 6.25, and 12.5 mcg doses. VI 25 and 50 mcg once daily were also associated with 
greater  improvements  in  secondary  and  other  efficacy  parameters  including  0  to  24  hour  weighted 
mean  FEV1,  individual  serial  FEV1  time  points,  and  the  percentage  of  symptom-free  periods.  All  VI 
doses  were  well  tolerated  throughout  the  study  period.  Therefore,  based  on  the  efficacy  findings  as 
well  as  the  safety  profile,  the  25  mcg dose  was  chosen  as  the  lowest effective  dose  for  evaluation  in 
Phase III. 
Trough FEV1 (primary endpoint) findings from the VI Phase IIb studies are shown in the below table.

A once-daily dosing interval for VI was supported by demonstration of similar efficacy when the same 
total  daily  dose  was  given  once-daily  or  twice-daily.  In  study  HZA113310,  performed  in  asthmatics, 
there was minimal difference in 0 to 24 hour weighted mean FEV1 between VI 12.5 mcg once-daily (LS 
mean difference from placebo of 0.168 L) and 6.25 mcg twice-daily (LS mean difference from placebo 
of  0.166  L),  demonstrating  no  advantage  for  twice-daily  dosing  over  once-daily  dosing  for  the  same 
total daily dose. The 24 hour serial FEV1 curves supported the once daily dosing profile of VI.

placebo-controlled  studies  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  GSK573719/GW642444  inhalation 
powder and the individual components delivered once-daily via a novel dry powder inhaler in subjects 
with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). 
Study Participants 
Inclusion criteria 
Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must have met all of the following criteria: 
1.  Type of subject: Outpatient. 
2.  Informed Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent prior to study participation. 
3.  Age: 40 years of age or older at Visit 1. 
4.  Gender: Male and female subjects were eligible to participate in the study. 
5.  Diagnosis:  An  established  clinical  history  of  COPD  in  accordance  with  the  definition  by  the 
American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society [Celli, 2004] as follows: 
Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  is  a  preventable  and  treatable  disease  state 
characterized  by  airflow  limitation  that  is  not  fully  reversible.  The  airflow  limitation  is  usually 
progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious 
particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it 
also produces significant systemic consequences. 
6.  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of 
≥10  pack-years  [number  of  pack-years  =  (number  of  cigarettes  per  day  /  20)  x  number  of 
years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years 
both equal 10 pack-years)]. Former smokers were defined as those who had stopped smoking 
for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. 
7.  Severity of Disease: A post-salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of <0.70 and a post-salbutamol FEV1 
of  ≤70%  of  predicted  normal  values  calculated  using  the  National  Health  and  Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) III reference equations at Visit 1 [Hankinson, 1999; Hankinson, 
2010]. 
8.  Dyspnea: A score of ≥2  on the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC)  Dyspnea Scale at 
Visit 1.

during the study. 
2.  Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma. 
3.  Other  Respiratory  Disorders:  Known  respiratory  disorders  other  than  COPD  including,  but 
not  limited  to,  α-1  antitrypsin  deficiency,  active  tuberculosis,  bronchiectasis,  sarcoidosis,  lung 
fibrosis,  pulmonary  hypertension,  and  interstitial  lung  disease.  Allergic  rhinitis  was  not 
exclusionary. 
4.  Other  Diseases/Abnormalities:  Subjects  with  historical  or  current  evidence  of  clinically 
significant  cardiovascular,  neurological,  psychiatric,  renal,  hepatic,  immunological,  endocrine

uncontrolled  and/or  a  previous  history  of  cancer  in  remission  for  <5  years  prior  to  Visit  1 
(localized  carcinoma  of  the  skin  that  had  been  resected  for  cure  is  not  exclusionary). 
Significant  was  defined  as  any  disease  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  would  put  the 
safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety 
analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. 
5.  Chest  X-Ray:  A  chest  X-ray  or  computed  tomography  (CT)  scan  that  revealed  evidence  of 
clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A chest X-
ray  must  have  been  taken  at  Visit  1  if  a  chest  X-ray  or  CT  scan  was  not  available  within  6 
months  prior  to  Visit  1.  For  subjects  in  Germany,  if  a  chest  X-ray  (or  CT  scan)  was  not 
available in the 6 months prior to Visit 1, the subject was not eligible for the study. 
6.  Contraindications:  A  history  of  allergy  or  hypersensitivity  to  any  anticholinergic/muscarinic 
receptor  antagonist,  beta2-agonist,  lactose/milk  protein  or  magnesium  stearate,  or  a  medical 
condition  such  as  of  narrow-angle  glaucoma,  prostatic  hypertrophy,  or  bladder  neck 
obstruction that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicated study participation or use of 
an inhaled anticholinergic.

Visit  1,  including  the  presence  of  a  paced  rhythm  on  a  12-lead  ECG  which  caused  the 
underlying  rhythm  and  ECG  to  be  obscured.  Investigators  were  provided  with  ECG  reviews 
conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. 
Specific ECG findings that precluded subject eligibility are listed in Appendix 3 of the protocol. 
The study investigator determined the medical significance of any ECG abnormalities not listed 
in Appendix 3 of the protocol. 
10. Holter  Monitoring:  An  abnormal  and  significant  finding  from  24-hour  Holter  monitoring  at 
Visit  1.  This  exclusion  only  applied  to  the  subset  of  subjects  performing  24-hour  Holter 
monitoring.  Investigators  were  provided  with  Holter  reviews  conducted  by  an  independent 
cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. Specific findings that precluded subject 
study eligibility are listed in Appendix 5 of the protocol. The study investigator determined the 
medical significance of any Holter abnormalities not listed in Appendix 5 of the protocol.

14. Nebulized  Therapy:  Regular  use  (prescribed  for  use  every  day,  not  for  as-needed  use)  of 
short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., salbutamol via nebulized therapy). 
15. Pulmonary  Rehabilitation  Program:  Participation  in  the  acute  phase  of  a  pulmonary 
rehabilitation  program  within  4  weeks  prior to  Visit 1.  Subjects  who  were  in  the  maintenance 
phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program were not excluded. 
16. Drug or Alcohol Abuse: A known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years

Treatments 
The Applicant provided the study drug for use in this study. All blinded study drug was delivered via an 
NDPI.  The  NDPI  provided  a  total  of  30  doses.  Each  NDPI  was  comprised  of  one  or  two  double-foil, 
laminate, blister strips.  
The  NDPIs  containing  study  drug  were  identical  in  appearance.  Subjects  were  instructed  to  take  one 
inhalation each morning from their NDPI. 
All subjects received supplemental salbutamol (MDI and/or nebules) to be used on an as-needed basis 
(rescue medication) throughout the study. Salbutamol was sourced from local commercial stock. If not 
available locally, the Applicant sourced it centrally. 
Ipratropium  bromide  MDI  for  additional  responsiveness  testing  at  Visit  1  was  sourced  from  local 
commercial stock. If not available locally, then the Applicant sourced it centrally. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  UMEC/VI  Inhalation 
Powder, UMEC Inhalation Powder, and VI Inhalation Powder when administered once-daily via a Novel 
Dry Powder Inhaler (NDPI) over 24 weeks in subjects with COPD. 
A  secondary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  characterize  the  PK  of  UMEC  and  VI  administered  in 
combination  and  individually  using  population  PK  methodology,  explore  effects  of  covariates  on  PK 
parameters, to evaluate PK-pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships, if any, between UMEC or VI systemic 
exposure  and  systemic  PD  endpoints  following  administration  of  the  UMEC/VI  combination  and  the 
individual treatments to subjects with COPD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the trough FEV1 on Day 169. Trough FEV1 on Day 169 was defined 
as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 168 (i.e., at the Week 
24 Visit). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Mean  TDI  focal  score  at  Week  24.  (TDI  focal  score  was  considered  a  key  secondary  endpoint 
for  relevant  regulatory  authority  submissions,  including  to  the  EMA  and  other  relevant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 132/308 
 
  
  
regulatory authorities, and was considered an ‘other endpoint’ for regulatory submission to the 
US FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities.) 
•  Weighted mean FEV1 over 0 to 6 hours postdose at Week 24. 
Sample size 
The sample size was calculated in order to provide sufficient power for the comparison of the primary 
and secondary endpoints, including TDI. 
The  sample  size  calculations  used  a  two-sided  5%  significance  level  and  an  estimate  of  residual 
standard deviation (SD) for TDI of 3.24 units. The estimate of SD is based on Mixed Model Repeated 
Measures (MMRM) analyses of a previous study in COPD subjects with the FP/salmeterol combination. 
In order to provide additional safety data for the active treatments, subjects were randomized to active 
treatment arms or placebo in a 3:2 ratio. A study with 273 evaluable subjects in each active arm and 
182  evaluable  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  would  have  90%  power  to  detect  a  1-unit  difference 
between  treatments  in  TDI.  This  treatment  difference  has  been  selected  as  the  generally  accepted 
minimally important difference for this endpoint [Witek and Mahler, 2003]. 
With this number of evaluable subjects per active arm, the study would have >99% power to detect a 
100  mL  difference  between  UMEC/VI  and  either  UMEC  or  VI,  or  between  an  active  treatment  and 
placebo, at the two-sided 5% significance level. It would have 90% power to detect a difference of 58 
mL  between  UMEC/VI  and  either  UMEC  or  VI,  or  68  mL  between  an  active  treatment  and  placebo. 
These calculations used an estimate of residual SD for trough FEV1 of 210 mL. The estimate of SD was 
based on MMRM analyses of previous studies in COPD subjects with UMEC, VI, and the FP/salmeterol 
combination. 
For  the  EMA  and  other  relevant  submissions,  statistical  inference  for  TDI  was  conditional  on  having 
achieved statistical significance on the primary endpoint, trough FEV1. Powering trough FEV1 at >99% 
would  maintain  90%  power  (conditional  on  trough  FEV1  analysis)  for  the  analysis  of  TDI  for  this 
submission. 
It  was  estimated  that  approximately  30%  of  subjects  would  withdraw  without  providing  a  Day  168 
(Week 24) assessment. Although, in MMRM, all available post-baseline assessments up to endpoint for 
subjects in the ITT population are utilized in the analysis, data for subjects who withdrew prematurely 
from the study were not explicitly imputed. 
Hence,  to  account  for  a  30%  withdrawal  rate,  399  subjects  were  to  be  randomized  to  each  active 
treatment arm and 266 subjects were to be randomized to placebo. 
Randomisation 
Subjects  were  assigned  to  study  treatment  in  accordance  with  a  randomization  schedule.  The 
randomization  code  was  generated  by  the  Applicant  using  a  validated  computerized  system  RandAll 
version  2.5.  Subjects  were  randomized  using  RAMOS,  an  Interactive  Voice  Response  System  (IVRS). 
This is a telephone based system used by the investigator or designee. 
Following the completion of the Run-in Period, eligible subjects were to be randomized in a 3:3:3:2 (3 
active:2  placebo)  ratio  (n=399  to  active  treatment  and  n=266  to  placebo)  to  one  of  the  following  4 
possible treatments: 
•  UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg once-daily 
•  UMEC 125 mcg once-daily 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 133/308 
 
  
  
•  VI 25 mcg once-daily 
• 
Placebo once-daily. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study drugs taken during the 24-week Treatment Period were administered in a double-blind fashion. 
Neither the subject nor the study physician knew which study drug the subject was receiving. 
Statistical methods 
The following treatment comparisons were performed on trough FEV1 on Day 169: 
•  UMEC/VI vs. placebo 
•  UMEC vs. placebo 
•  VI vs. placebo 
•  UMEC/VI vs. VI 
•  UMEC/VI vs. UMEC. 
In  order  to  account  for  multiplicity  across  treatment  comparisons  and  endpoints,  a  step-down  closed 
testing  procedure  was  applied,  whereby  inference  for  a  test  in  the  pre-defined  hierarchy  was 
dependent  upon  statistical  significance  having  been  achieved  for  previous  tests  in  the  hierarchy.  The 
hierarchy consisted of the five treatment comparisons described above, performed in that order, on the 
primary and secondary endpoints. 
All  programming  was  performed  in  a  Harmonization  for  Analysis  and  Reporting  (HARP)  environment 
using SAS Version 9 and S-Plus Version 7 or a later release. 
The primary endpoint of trough FEV1 on Day 169 was analyzed for the ITT population using a MMRM 
analysis  [Siddiqui,  2009],  including  covariates  of  baseline  FEV1,  smoking  status,  Day,  center  group, 
treatment, Day by baseline interaction, and Day by treatment interaction, where Day was nominal. The 
model  used  all  available  trough  FEV1  values  recorded  on  Days  2,  28,  56,  84,  112,  168,  and  169. 
Missing  data  were  not  directly  imputed  in  this  analysis;  however,  all  non-missing  data  for  a  subject 
were used within the analysis to estimate the treatment effect for trough FEV1 on Day 169. 
Missing  data  were  not  explicitly  imputed  in  the  primary  MMRM  analysis,  although  there  was  an 
underlying  assumption  that  data  were  missing  at  random.  All  available  scheduled  post-baseline 
assessments up to endpoint were utilized and, via modeling of the within-subject correlation structure, 
the derived treatment differences at Day 169 were adjusted to take into account missing data.

Outcomes and estimation 
Study DB2113361 
Trough FEV1 at Day 169: Primary Endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  trough  FEV1  at  Day  169.  Trough  FEV1  at  Day  169  was  defined  as 
the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 168 (i.e., at the Week 24 
Visit). 
The UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg, UMEC 125 mcg, and VI 25 mcg treatment groups demonstrated statistically 
significant greater LS mean changes from baseline in trough FEV1 at Day 169 compared with placebo 
(see  table  below).  The  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  treatment  group  also  demonstrated  statistically 
significant greater LS mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 at Day 169 compared with both the 
VI 25 mcg and UMEC 125 mcg treatment groups.

Transition Dyspnea Index Focal Score at Day 168, Day 28, and Day 84 
In  accordance  with  the  CHMP  guidance,  the  TDI  score  was  designated  as  a  key  secondary  efficacy 
endpoint for evaluation by the EMA and any other relevant regulatory authorities. 
Clinically  meaningful  mean  improvements  in  TDI  scores  from  baseline  (i.e.,  >1;  demonstrating  an 
improvement in dyspnea) were observed in the UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg, UMEC 125mcg, and VI 25 mcg 
treatment  groups  at  Day  168.  A  statistically  significant  greater  LS  mean  TDI  focal  score  was 
demonstrated  for  the  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  group  compared  with  placebo  at  Day  168  (see  table 
below). 
The  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment  group  did  not  demonstrate  statistically  significant  differences  in  LS 
mean TDI focal score compared with placebo at Day 168. Based on application of the testing hierarchy, 
the results of all further statistical analyses should be interpreted only descriptively in instances where 
the TDI score at Day 168 was designated as the key secondary efficacy endpoint.

Methods 
Study participants 
Inclusion criteria 
Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must have met all of the following criteria: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 150/308 
 
 
  
  
1.  Type of subject: Outpatient. 
2.  Informed Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent prior to study participation. 
3.  Age: Subjects 40 years of age or older at Visit 1. 
4.  Gender: Male or female subjects. 
5.  Diagnosis:  An  established  clinical  history  of  COPD  in  accordance  with  the  definition  by  the 
American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society [Celli, 2004] as follows: 
Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  is  a  preventable  and  treatable  disease  state 
characterized  by  airflow  limitation  that  is  not  fully  reversible.  The  airflow  limitation  is  usually 
progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious 
particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it 
also produces significant systemic consequences. 
6.  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of 
≥10 pack-years [number of pack-years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years 
smoked  (e.g.,  20  cigarettes  per  day  for  10  years,  or  10  cigarettes  per  day  for  20  years)]. 
Previous smokers were defined as those who had stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior 
to Visit 1. 
7.  Severity of Disease: A post-salbutamol FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of <0.70 and a 
post-salbutamol FEV1 of ≤70% of predicted normal values calculated using National Health and 
Nutritional Examination survey (NHANES) III reference equations at Visit 1 [Hankinson, 1999; 
Hankinson, 2010] 
8.  Dyspnea: A score of ≥2 on the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale at 
Visit 1.

Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not have been enrolled in the study: 
1.  Pregnancy:  Women  who were  pregnant  or lactating  or  were planning  on becoming  pregnant 
during the study 
2.  Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma 
3.  Other  Respiratory  Disorders:  Known  respiratory  disorders  other  than  COPD  including  but 
not  limited  to  α-1  antitrypsin  deficiency,  active  tuberculosis,  bronchiectasis,  sarcoidosis,  lung 
fibrosis,  pulmonary  hypertension,  and  interstitial  lung  disease.  Allergic  rhinitis  was  not 
exclusionary. 
4.  Other  Diseases/Abnormalities:  Subjects  with  historical  or  current  evidence  of  clinically 
significant  cardiovascular,  neurological,  psychiatric,  renal,  hepatic,  immunological,  endocrine 
(including  uncontrolled  diabetes or thyroid  disease),  or  hematological  abnormalities that  were 
uncontrolled  and/or  a  previous  history  of  cancer  in  remission  for  <5  years  prior  to  Visit  1 
(localized carcinoma of the skin that has been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant 
was defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the 
subject at risk through disease/condition exacerbated during the study. 
5.  Chest  X-Ray:  A  chest  X-ray  or  computed  tomography  (CT)  scan  that  revealed  evidence  of 
clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A chest X-
ray  must  have  been  taken  at  Visit  1  if  a  chest  X-ray  or  CT  scan  was  not  available  within  6

months  prior  to  Visit  1.  For  subjects  in  Germany,  if  a  chest  X-ray  (or  CT  scan)  was  not 
available in the 6 months prior to Visit 1, the subject was not eligible for the study. 
6.  Contraindications:  A  history  of  allergy  or  hypersensitivity  to  any  anticholinergic/muscarinic 
receptor  antagonist,  beta2-agonist,  lactose/milk  protein  or  magnesium  stearate,  or  a  medical 
condition  such  as  narrow-angle  glaucoma,  prostatic  hypertrophy,  or  bladder  neck  obstruction 
that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  study  physician,  contraindicated  study  participation  or  use  of  an 
inhaled anticholinergic. 
7.  Hospitalization: Hospitalization for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1 
8.  Lung Resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to 
Screening (Visit 1) 
9.  12-lead  ECG:  An  abnormal  and  significant  ECG  finding  from  the  12-lead  ECG  conducted  at 
Visit  1,  including  the  presence  of  a  paced  rhythm  on  a  12-lead  ECG  which  caused  the 
underlying  rhythm  and  ECG  to  be  obscured.  Investigators  were  provided  with  ECG  reviews 
conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. 
Specific ECG findings that precluded subject eligibility are listed in Appendix 5 of the protocol. 
The study investigator determined the medical significance of any ECG abnormalities not listed 
in Appendix 5 of the protocol. 
10. Screening Labs: Significantly abnormal finding from clinical chemistry or hematology tests at 
Visit 1 
11. Medication  Prior  to  Spirometry:  Unable  to  withhold  salbutamol  for  the  4-hour  period 
required prior to spirometry testing at each study visit 
12. Oxygen: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as oxygen therapy prescribed for 
greater  than  12  hours  a  day.  As-needed  oxygen  use  (i.e.,  ≤12  hours  per  day)  was  not 
exclusionary. 
13. Nebulized  Therapy:  Regular  use  (prescribed  for  use  every  day,  not  for  as-needed  use)  of 
short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., salbutamol) via nebulized therapy. 
14. Pulmonary  Rehabilitation  Program:  Participation  in  the  acute  phase  of  a  pulmonary 
rehabilitation  program  within  4  weeks  prior to  Visit 1.  Subjects  who  were  in  the  maintenance 
phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program were not excluded. 
15. Drug or Alcohol Abuse: A known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years 
prior to Visit 1. 
Treatments 
The  Applicant  provided  the  study  drug  for  use  in  this  study.  The  following  double-blind  study  drugs 
were used in this study: 
•  UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg once-daily via NDPI + placebo once-daily via HandiHaler 
•  UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg once-daily via NDPI + placebo once-daily via HandiHaler 
•  VI 25 mcg once-daily via NDPI + placebo once-daily via HandiHaler 
• 
TIO 18 mcg once-daily via HandiHaler + placebo once-daily via NDPI 
Subjects were instructed to take one dose each morning from both the NDPI and the HandiHaler. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 152/308 
 
  
  
On  the  morning  of  each  clinic  study  visit,  subjects  refrained  from  taking  their  morning  dose  of  study 
drug until instructed to do so by clinic personnel. Study drug was given at the clinic at approximately 
the  same  time  of  day  as  Day  1  (Visit  2).  On  the  other  days  during  the  Treatment  Period  (i.e.,  “non-
clinic  days”),  subjects  were  instructed  to  take  their  study  drug  each  morning  at  approximately  the 
same time of day as the dose time on Day 1 (Visit 2). 
Double-blind  UMEC/VI,  VI,  and  matching  placebo  (identical  in  appearance  to  the  inhaler  containing 
active  study  drug)  were  administered  via  an  NDPI  for  oral  inhalation.  The  NDPI  for  UMEC/VI  and 
placebo contained two, double-foil, laminate, blister strips within the NDPI. The NDPI provided a total 
of 30 doses (60 blisters) and delivered, when actuated, the contents of a single blister simultaneously 
from each of the 2 blister strips. The NDPI for VI alone contained a single, double-foil, laminate blister 
strip, with a total of 30 doses in the NDPI. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two doses of UMEC/VI (125/25 mcg 
and  62.5/25  mcg once-daily)  with  VI  (25  mcg  once-daily)  and  with  TIO  (18  mcg  once-daily)  over  24 
weeks for the treatment of subjects with COPD. 
Secondary Objectives 
Secondary objectives of this study were to compare effects of two doses of UMEC/VI (125/25 mcg and 
62.5/25 mcg once-daily) with VI (25 mcg once-daily) and with TIO (18 mcg once-daily) on safety and 
quality of life assessments over 24 weeks in subjects with COPD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and predose) FEV1 on Day 
169. 
Trough FEV1 on Treatment Day 169 was defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 and 24 
hours after dosing on Treatment Day 168 (i.e., at the Week 24 visit). 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the weighted mean 0 to 6 hour FEV1 obtained postdose at Week 
24. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  for  the  individual  studies  was  calculated  in  order  to  provide  sufficient  power  for  the 
comparisons  of  trough  FEV1,  and  also  for  the  comparisons  of  TDI  for  UMEC/VI  and  TIO  in  the  meta-
analysis. This meta-analysis of TDI will include data from both this study and Study DB2113374, and 
will be provided as a separate report. 
The sample size calculations used a 2-sided 5% significance level and an estimate of residual standard 
deviation  (SD)  for  trough  FEV1  of  210  mL.  The  estimate  of  SD  was  based  on  Mixed  Model  Repeated 
Measures (MMRM) analyses of previous studies in COPD subjects with UMEC, VI, and the FP/salmeterol 
combination. A study with 94 evaluable subjects per arm has 90% power to detect a 100 mL difference 
(which is recognized as a minimal important difference) between treatments in trough FEV1. 
For the meta-analysis of TDI, the sample size calculations used a two-sided 5% significance level and 
an estimate of residual SD for TDI of 3.24 units. The estimate of SD was based on MMRM analysis of a 
previous  study  in  COPD  subjects  with  the  FP/salmeterol  combination.  An  analysis  including  221 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 153/308 
 
  
  
evaluable  subjects  per  arm  has  90%  power  to  detect  a  1-unit  difference  between  treatments  in  TDI. 
This treatment difference was selected as the generally accepted minimally important difference (MID) 
for this endpoint [Witek, 2003; Mahler, 1984]. In order to achieve this, a sample size of 111 evaluable 
subjects per arm per study was required. 
In  order  to  meet  ICH  guidelines  on  exposure  to  new  medicinal  products  (E1A)  for  UMEC/VI,  the 
planned number of evaluable subjects in each arm was increased to 146. 
A study with 146 evaluable subjects per treatment arm would provide 98% power to detect a 100 mL 
difference in trough FEV1 between treatment groups and 96% power to detect a difference of 1 unit in 
TDI in the meta-analysis using the assumptions above. As statistical inference for a particular UMEC/VI 
dose vs. TIO on TDI in the meta-analysis was conditional on having achieved statistical significance for 
that  comparison  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  trough  FEV1,  in  each  individual  study,  powering 
trough  FEV1  in  each  study  and  TDI  in  the  meta-analysis  each  at  >90%  provides  92%  power 
(conditional on trough FEV1 analysis) for the combined analysis of TDI. 
It  was  estimated  that  approximately  30%  of  subjects  could  withdraw  without  providing  a  Week  24 
assessment.  Although,  in  MMRM,  all  available  post-baseline  assessments  up  to  the  endpoint  for 
subjects in the ITT population are utilized in the analysis, data for subjects who withdrew prematurely 
from  the  study  were  not  explicitly  imputed.  Hence,  to  allow  for  a  30%  withdrawal  rate,  208  subjects 
were to be randomized to each treatment arm. 
Randomisation 
Subjects  were  assigned  to  study  treatment  in  accordance  with  the  randomization  schedule.  The 
randomization  code  was  generated  by  the  Applicant  using  a  validated  computerized  system  RandAll 
version  2.5.  Subjects  were  randomized  using  RAMOS,  an  interactive  voice  response  system  (IVRS). 
This is a telephone based system used by the investigator or designee. 
Once  a  randomization  number  was  assigned  to  a  subject  it  could  not  be  reassigned  to  any  other 
subject in the study. 
Subjects who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of the blinded study treatment 
regimens in equal proportion. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study  drug  taken  during  the  24-week  treatment  period  was  administered  in  a  double-blind  fashion. 
Neither  the  subject  nor  the  study  physician  knew  which  study  drug  the  subject  was  receiving. 
Measures  were  taken  to  ensure  integrity  of  the  blind.  As  there  were  differences  in  the  appearance  in 
active TIO and placebo capsules, both the active marketed product and placebo blister packages were 
covered  with  opaque  over-labels,  the  HandiHalers  were  covered  with  labels  to  mask  any  identifying 
marks  on  the  inhaler,  and  medications  were  administered  by  a  third  party  at  the  study  site  not 
involved  in  efficacy  or  safety  endpoints  that  could  be  influenced  by  knowledge  of  study  treatment 
assignment. 
Statistical methods 
The following treatment comparisons were performed for trough FEV1 on Day 169: 
•  UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs. TIO 
•  UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs. VI 25 mcg

To  account  for  multiplicity  across  treatment  comparisons  and  endpoints,  a  step-down  closed  testing 
procedure  was  applied  whereby  inference  for  a  test  in  the  predefined  hierarchy  was  dependent  upon 
statistical  significance  having  been  achieved  for  previous  tests  in  the  hierarchy.  The  hierarchy 
consisted  of  the  treatment  comparisons  above,  performed  for  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints, followed by the same treatment comparisons on the same endpoints for the lower UMEC/VI 
dose. 
All  programming  was  performed  in  a  Harmonization  for  Analysis  and  Reporting  (HARP)  environment 
using SAS Version 9 and S-Plus Version 7 or a later release.

Outcomes and estimation 
Study DB2113360 
Trough FEV1 at Day 169: Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was trough FEV1 on Day 169. Trough FEV1 on Day 169 was defined as 
the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 168 (i.e., at the Week 24 
[Day 168] Visit). 
Statistically  significant  improvements  in  least  squares  (LS)  mean  change  from  baseline  trough  FEV1 
were  demonstrated  for  both  the  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  mcg  and  the  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  treatment 
groups compared with both the VI 25 mcg and TIO treatment groups at Day 169 (see table below).

Weighted Mean FEV1 Over 0 to 6 Hours Postdose at Day 168 (Secondary Endpoint), Day 1, and Day 84 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the 0 to 6 hour postdose weighted mean FEV1 on Day 168. 
Statistically significant improvements in LS mean change from baseline in 0 to 6 hour weighted mean 
FEV1  were  demonstrated  for  both  the  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  mcg  and  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  treatment 
groups compared with both the VI 25 mcg and TIO treatment groups at Day 168, as well as at Days 1 
and 84 (see table below).

Trough FEV1 at Day 169: Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was trough FEV1 on Day 169. Trough FEV1 on Day 169 was defined as 
the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 168 (i.e., at the Week 24 
Visit). 
The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline trough FEV1 was 0.223 L for the UMEC/VI 125/25 
mcg  group, 0.208  L  for the  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  mcg  group,  0.186  L  for the  UMEC  125  mcg group,  and 
0.149 L for the TIO group (see table below). 
The  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  treatment  group  showed  statistically  significant  improvement  in  LS  mean 
change from baseline trough FEV1 compared with TIO at Day 169 (0.074 L; see table below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 169/308 
 
 
  
  
The comparison of UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg against UMEC 125 mcg did not achieve statistical significance 
at the 5% level for the primary endpoint of trough FEV1 at Day 169; therefore, the restrictions of the 
step-down  testing  procedure  were  not  met  and  the  results  of  all  further  statistical  analyses  are 
described but are not strictly inferential. 
The  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  mcg  treatment group  showed a  greater improvement in  LS  mean  change  from 
baseline trough FEV1 compared with the TIO treatment group at Day 169. 
No treatment difference was observed for the comparison of UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg vs. UMEC 125 mcg 
(see table below).

The secondary efficacy endpoint was the 0 to 6 hour postdose weighted mean FEV1 on Day 168. 
The UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg and UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg treatment groups showed greater improvements 
in  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  in  0  to  6  hour  weighted  mean  FEV1  compared  with  both  TIO  and 
UMEC 125 mcg at Day 168 (secondary endpoint), as well as at Day 1 and Day 84 (see table below).

Inclusion criteria 
Subjects eligible for enrolment in the study must have met all of the following criteria: 
1.  Type of subject: Outpatient 
2.  Informed Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent prior to study participation 
3.  Age: 40 years of age or older at Visit 1 
4.  Gender: Male or female subjects 
5.  Diagnosis:  An  established  clinical  history  of  COPD  in  accordance  with  the  definition  by  the 
American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society [Celli, 2004] as follows: 
Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  is  a  preventable  and  treatable  disease  state 
characterized  by  airflow  limitation  that  is  not  fully  reversible.  The  airflow  limitation  is  usually 
progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious 
particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it 
also produces significant systemic consequences. 
6.  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of 
≥10  pack-years  [number  of  pack  years  =  (number  of  cigarettes  per  day  /  20)  x  number  of 
years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years]. 
Former smokers were defined as those who had stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to 
Visit 1. 
7.  Severity of Disease: A post-salbutamol FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of <0.70 and a 
post-salbutamol  FEV1  of  ≥35%  and  ≥70%  of  predicted  normal  values  calculated  using  the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination survey (NHANES) III reference equations at Visit 1 
[Hankinson, 1999; Hankinson, 2010]. 
8.  Dyspnea: A score of ≥2  on the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC)  Dyspnea Scale at 
Visit 1 
9.  Resting Lung Volumes: A resting FRC of ≥120% of predicted normal FRC at Visit 1. Predicted 
values for FRC and total lung capacity (TLC) were obtained using predicted normal values from 
[Stocks, 1995]. 
Exclusion criteria 
Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not have been enrolled in the study: 
1.  Pregnancy: Women  who  were  pregnant  or lactating  or  were planning  on  becoming  pregnant 
during the study 
2.  Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma 
3.  Other  Respiratory  Disorders:  Known  respiratory  disorders  other  than  COPD  including  but 
not  limited  to  α-1  antitrypsin  deficiency,  active  tuberculosis,  bronchiectasis,  sarcoidosis,  lung 
fibrosis,  pulmonary  hypertension,  and  interstitial  lung  disease.  Allergic  rhinitis  was  not 
exclusionary. 
4.  Other  Diseases/Abnormalities:  Subjects  with  historical  or  current  evidence  of  clinically 
significant  cardiovascular,  neurological,  psychiatric,  renal,  hepatic,  immunological,  endocrine 
(including  uncontrolled  diabetes or thyroid  disease),  or  hematological  abnormalities that  were 
uncontrolled  and/or  a  previous  history  of  cancer  in  remission  for  <5  years  prior  to  Visit  1 
(localized  carcinoma  of  the  skin  that  had  been  resected  for  cure  was  not  exclusionary). 
Assessment report

Significant  was  defined  as  any  disease  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  would  put  the 
safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety 
analysis  if  the  disease/condition  exacerbated  during  the  study.  Any  physical  or  mental 
abnormality  which  would  affect  the  subject  carrying  out  exercise  tests  including  peripheral 
vascular disease should have been excluded at the investigators discretion. 
5.  Chest  X-Ray:  A  chest  X-ray  or  computed  tomography  (CT)  scan  that  revealed  evidence  of 
clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A chest X-
ray  must  have  been  taken  at  Visit  1  if  a  chest  X-ray  or  CT  scan  was  not  available  within  6 
months  prior  to  Visit  1.  For  subjects  in  Germany,  if  a  chest  X-ray  (or  CT  scan)  was  not 
available in the 6 months prior to Visit 1, the subject was not eligible for the study. 
6.  Contraindications:  A  history  of  allergy  or  hypersensitivity  to  any  anticholinergic/muscarinic 
receptor  antagonist,  beta2-agonist,  lactose/milk  protein  or  magnesium  stearate,  or  a  medical 
condition  such  as  narrow-angle  glaucoma,  prostatic  hypertrophy,  or  bladder  neck  obstruction 
that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  study  physician,  contraindicated  study  participation  or  use  of  an 
inhaled anticholinergic. 
7.  Hospitalization:  Hospitalization  for  COPD  or  pneumonia  within  12  weeks  prior  to  Screening 
(Visit 1). 
8.  Lung Resection: Subjects  with  lung  volume  reduction  surgery  within the  12 months  prior  to 
Screening (Visit 1). 
9.  12-Lead  ECG:  An  abnormal  and  significant  ECG  finding  from  the  12-lead  ECG  conducted  at 
Visit  1,  including  the  presence  of  a  paced  rhythm  on  a  12-lead  ECG  which  caused  the 
underlying  rhythm  and  ECG  to  be  obscured.  Investigators  were  provided  with  ECG  reviews 
conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. 
Specific ECG findings that precluded subject eligibility are listed in Appendix 3 of the protocol. 
The study investigator determined the medical significance of any ECG abnormalities not listed 
in Appendix 3 of the protocol. 
10. Screening  Labs:  Significantly  abnormal  finding  from  clinical  chemistry  and  hematology  tests 
at Visit 1. 
11. Medication  Prior  to  Spirometry:  Unable  to  withhold  salbutamol  for  the  4-hour  period 
required prior to spirometry testing at each study visit. 
12. Oxygen: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as oxygen therapy prescribed for 
greater  than  12  hours  a  day.  As-needed  oxygen  use  (i.e.,  ≤12  hours  per  day)  was  not 
exclusionary. 
13. Nebulized  Therapy:  Regular  use  (prescribed  for  use  every  day,  not  for  as-needed  use)  of 
short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., salbutamol) via nebulized therapy. 
14. Pulmonary  Rehabilitation  Program:  Participation  in  the  acute  phase  of  a  pulmonary 
rehabilitation  program  within  4  weeks  prior to  Visit 1.  Subjects  who  were  in  the  maintenance 
phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program were not excluded.

Treatments 
The Applicant provided the study drug for use in this study. All blinded study drug was delivered via a 
NDPI. The NDPI provided a total of 30 doses. Each NDPI comprised 1 or 2 double-foil, laminate, blister 
strips.  
The  NDPIs  containing  study  drug  were  identical  in  appearance.  Subjects  were  instructed  to  take  1 
inhalation each morning from their NDPI. 
All subjects received supplemental salbutamol (metered-dose inhaler [MDI] and/or nebules) to be used 
on an as-needed basis (rescue medication) throughout the study. 
Salbutamol was sourced from local commercial stock. If  not available locally, the Applicant sourced it 
centrally. 
Ipratropium  bromide  MDI  for  additional  responsiveness  testing  at  Visit  1  was  sourced  from  local 
commercial stock. If not available locally, then the Applicant sourced it centrally. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of UMEC/VI administered once-daily, on 
exercise  endurance  time  (EET)  measured  using  the  endurance  shuttle  walk  test  (ESWT)  and  trough 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and over 12 weeks in subjects with COPD. 
The  secondary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  UMEC/VI,  its  components,  and 
placebo administered once-daily on lung volume measures and postdose lung function over 12 weeks 
in subjects with COPD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were: 
• 
EET postdose at Week 12, defined as the EET obtained 3 hours after dosing at Week 12 and 
•  Clinic  visit  trough  (pre-bronchodilator  and  predose)  FEV1  at  Week  12  (Treatment  Day  85), 
defined as the FEV1 value obtained 24 hours after dosing on Treatment Day 84. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Measures of lung volume (IC, FRC, and RV) at Week 12 (trough and 3-hour Postdose) 
•  Clinic visit 3-hour postdose FEV1 at Week 12. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculations used an estimate of residual standard deviation (SD) for the EET of 114 
seconds.  For  the  purposes  of  converting  this  between-subject  SD  from  a  parallel  group  study  to  an 
estimate of a within-subject SD for a cross-over study, the SD has been divided by a factor of square 
root  of  2;  this  assumes  a  correlation  of  0.5  between  measurements  on  the  same  subject.  This  value 
was based on data from a previous ESWT study [Revill, 1999] indicating that a reasonable estimate of 
SD for EET in a parallel group study was 160 seconds. A study  with 208 evaluable subjects has 94% 
power to detect a 70 second difference in EET between either of the UMEC/VI doses and placebo at the 
two-sided  5%  significance  level.  A  difference  of  70  seconds  was  considered  a  clinically  important 
difference for within-subject comparisons of EET (Brouillard, 2007). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 175/308 
 
  
  
This  difference  is  therefore  considered  appropriate  for  the  comparison  of  active  treatments  with 
placebo. With this number of evaluable subjects, the study has 64% power to detect a difference of 70 
seconds  between  the  UMEC  doses  and  placebo  and  77%  power  to  detect  a  difference  of  70  seconds 
between the VI group and placebo. In a recent publication the MCID for the ESWT was determined to 
be  45  to  85  seconds  (or  60-115  meters)  after  bronchodilation  is  likely  to  be  perceived  by  patients 
(Pepin, 2011). 
The sample size calculations for trough FEV1 used an estimate of residual SD based upon a Phase IIb 
study  for  UMEC  in  COPD  subjects  (AC4113073).  From  this  study,  the  residual  within-subject  SD  was 
168 mL; therefore, this value was used for the sample size calculations for trough FEV1. A study with 
208  evaluable  subjects  has  92%  power  to  detect  a  100  mL  difference  in  trough  FEV1 between  either 
dose of UMEC/VI and placebo at the two-sided 5% significance level. A 100 mL difference is considered 
appropriate for comparisons of UMEC/VI and its components versus placebo for trough FEV1. 
In a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis, all available post-baseline assessments up to 
the  endpoint  are  utilized  in  the  analysis;  however,  data  for  subjects  who  withdrew  prematurely  from 
the  study  were  not  explicitly  imputed.  Hence,  to  allow  for  a  30%  withdrawal rate,  312  subjects  were 
randomized. Twelve subjects were to be randomized to each treatment sequence. 
Assuming  50%  of  screened  subjects  would  not  be  eligible  for  randomization,  approximately  624 
subjects were planned to be screened for this study. 
Randomisation 
Subjects  were  assigned  to  study  treatment  in  accordance  with  the  randomization  schedule.  The 
randomization  code  was  generated  by  the  Applicant  using  a  validated  computerized  system  RandAll 
version  2.5.  Subjects  were  randomized  using  RAMOS,  an  Interactive  Voice  Response  System  (IVRS). 
This is a telephone based system used by the investigator or designee. Once a randomization number 
had been assigned to a subject, the same number could not be reassigned to any other subject in the 
study. 
Randomization to blinded study drug occurred at Visit 4 after the spirometry, lung volumes, diffusion 
capacity,  and  ESWT  procedures  were  completed,  and  were  stratified  by  use  of  the  Oxycon  mobile 
system (use or no use) to ensure treatment allocation was balanced within these groups. 
At Visit 4, eligible subjects were randomized to one of the sequences. The sequences were selected to 
optimize power for comparisons between UMEC/VI and placebo and therefore the number of subjects 
in each treatment was unbalanced. 
The duration of treatment for each subject in each period was 12 weeks. On the morning of each clinic 
study visit, subjects were to refrain from taking their morning dose of study drug until instructed to do 
so  by  clinic  personnel.  Study  drug  was  given  at  the  clinic  at  approximately  the  same  time  of  day  as 
Day  1  (Visit  4  or  Visit  9).  On  the  other  days  during  the  Treatment  Period  (i.e.,  “non-clinic  days”), 
subjects were instructed to take their study drug each morning at approximately the same time of day 
as the dose time on Day 1 (Visit 4 or Visit 9). 
This  study  utilized  an  Interactive  Voice  Response  System  (IVRS)  which  provided  a  means  for  central 
allocation  of  drug.  Each  investigator  was  supplied  with  sufficient  supplies  to  conduct  the  trial. 
Additional treatment packs were supplied as needed to the sites. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study  drug  taken  during  the  two  12-week  Treatment  Periods  was  administered  in  a  double-blind 
fashion. Neither the subject nor the study physician knew which study drug the subject was receiving.

Statistical methods 
The co-primary endpoint of 3-hour postdose EET at Week 12 was analyzed for the ITT population using 
a  MMRM  analysis  [Siddiqui,  2009],  including  covariates of  period  walking  speed,  mean  walking  speed 
(defined in Section 9.2.15 of the RAP), period, treatment, visit, smoking status, center group, visit by 
period  walking  speed  interaction,  visit  by  mean  walking  speed  interaction,  and  visit  by  treatment 
interaction,  where  visit  was  nominal.  The  model  used  all  available  3-hour  postdose  EET  values 
recorded  on  Day  2,  Week  6,  and  Week  12.  Missing  data  were  not  directly  imputed  in  this  analysis; 
however,  all  non-missing  data  for  a  subject  were  used  within  the  analysis  to  estimate  the  treatment 
effect for 3-hour postdose EET at Week 12. The response variable was change from baseline in 3-hour 
postdose EET. 
The co-primary endpoint of trough FEV1 at Week 12 was analyzed for the ITT population using a MMRM 
analysis,  including  covariates  of  period  baseline,  mean  baseline,  period,  treatment,  visit,  smoking 
status,  center  group,  visit  by  period  baseline  interaction,  visit by  mean  baseline  interaction,  and  visit 
by  treatment  interaction,  where  visit  was  nominal.  The  model  used  all  available  trough  FEV1  values 
recorded  on  Day  2,  Week  6,  and  Week  12.  Missing  data  were  not  directly  imputed  in  this  analysis; 
however,  all  non-missing  data  for  a  subject  were  used  within  the  analysis  to  estimate  the  treatment 
effect for trough FEV1 at Week 12. 
Missing  data  were  not  explicitly  imputed  in  the  co-primary  MMRM  analyses,  although  there  was  an 
underlying  assumption  that  data  were  missing  at  random.  All  available  scheduled  assessments  up  to 
endpoint  were  utilized  and,  via  modeling  of  the  within-subject  correlation  structure,  the  derived 
treatment differences at Week 12 were adjusted to take into account missing data. 
MMRM  analysis  (using  saturated  fixed  effects  and  an  unstructured  variance-covariance  matrix)  was 
considered  appropriate  as  the  primary  method  of  analysis  as  it  has  been  shown  to  provide  sensible 
answers to on-treatment questions in a range of practical situations [Siddiqui, 2009].

Treatments 
The following double-blind study drugs were used in this study: 
•  Dry powder formulations of UMEC/VI in the NDPI administered once-daily (in the morning) 
•  Dry powder formulations of UMEC in the NDPI administered once-daily (in the morning) 
•  Matching placebo in the NDPI once-daily (in the morning). 
The UMEC/VI in the NDPI contained 2 strips. One strip contained a blend of micronized UMEC (as the 
quaternary  ammonium  bromide  salt,  GSK573719A),  lactose  monohydrate  and  magnesium  stearate. 
The  second  strip  contained  a  blend  of  micronized  GW642444X  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt, 
GW642444M), lactose monohydrate, and magnesium stearate. Similarly, the placebo product consisted 
of  2  strips  each  containing  lactose  monohydrate  and  magnesium  stearate.  The  NDPI  delivered,  when 
actuated,  the  contents  of  a  single  blister  simultaneously  from  each  of  the  2  blister  strips.  The  LAMA 
monotherapy  product  consisted  of  a  single  strip  containing  UMEC  (as  the  quarternary  ammonium 
bromide salt, GSK573719A), lactose monohydrate, and magnesium stearate. 
Objectives 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  UMEC/VI  Inhalation  Powder 
125/25 mcg and UMEC Inhalation Powder 125 mcg compared with placebo administered once-daily. All 
products were to be delivered via the novel dry powder inhaler (NDPI) over 52 weeks in subjects with 
COPD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
There  were  no  efficacy  endpoints  specified  in  this  safety  and  tolerability  study.  COPD  exacerbations, 
rescue  salbutamol  and/or  ipratropium  use,  trough  FEV1,  and  trough  FVC  were  measured  as  safety 
parameters in this long-term safety study. 
The study endpoints included: 
•

•  AEs  of  special  interest  (cardiovascular,  effects  on  glucose,  effects  on  potassium,  tremor, 
urinary  retention,  ocular  effects,  gallbladder  disorders,  pneumonia, intestinal  obstruction,  and 
anticholinergic syndrome) 
•  Clinical chemistry and hematology parameters 
•  Vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and 24-hour Holter ECGs

Trough FEV1 and FVC. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  determined  based  on  meeting  ICH  guidelines  (ICH  E1A)  and  based  on  practical 
considerations. Two hundred (200) subjects were planned to be randomized to UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg, 
200 subjects were planned to be randomized to UMEC 125 mcg, and 100 subjects were planned to be 
randomized  to  placebo,  of  which  it  was  expected  that  at  least  120  subjects  in  each  active  treatment 
group and 60 subjects in the placebo group would have exposure data for the full 52 weeks, assuming 
at maximum a 40% withdrawal rate during the 52-week Treatment Period. 
Since the sample size was based on practical considerations, no sample size sensitivity was performed. 
No sample size re-estimation was planned. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule, which was 
center-based. Once a randomization number was assigned to a subject, the same number could not be 
reassigned to any other subject in the study. The code was generated by the Applicant using Randall 
version 2.5, a validated computerized system. 
The randomization used blocking, and one or more blocks were allocated to each center. Subjects were 
randomized  using  RAMOS  (Randomization  and  Medication  Ordering  System),  an  Interactive  Voice 
Response  System  (IVRS).  This  is  a  telephone-based  system  that  was  used  by  the  investigator  or 
designee  to  register  the  subject,  randomize  the  subject,  and  provide  medication  assignment 
information. 
All  subjects  were  dispensed  salbutamol  via  MDI  during  the  Run-in  and  Treatment  Periods  to  use  as 
needed.  Following  the  completion  of  the  Run-in  Period,  eligible  subjects  were  randomized  in  a  2:2:1 
ratio to one of the following double-blind treatment groups administered as 1 inhalation each morning 
for 52 weeks: 
•  UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg once-daily 
•  UMEC 125 mcg once-daily 
• 
Placebo once-daily.

Study  drug  was  double-blind.  Neither  the  subjects  nor  the  study  site  personnel  knew  the  treatment 
assignments. 
Statistical methods 
All  planned  analyses  were  performed  after  the  database  freeze  had  taken  place.  Once  this  had  been 
achieved, unblinding of the subjects occurred and analyses were performed. No interim analyses were 
planned or conducted. 
The following treatment comparisons were performed: 
•  UMEC/VI vs. placebo 
•  UMEC vs. placebo. 
No interim analysis was planned or performed. 
In this study, subjects were centrally randomized. It was likely that many centers would enroll a very 
small  number  of  subjects;  rather  than  adjusting  for  center  in  the  statistical  analyses,  a  center  group 
was  used.  This  consisted  of  all  centers  within  the  same  geographical  region.  All  center  groups  were 
finalized and documented prior to unblinding the treatment codes. 
Interaction  with  treatment  was  explored  by  fitting  a  model  with  an  additional  treatment  by  center 
group interaction term; any interaction found to be statistically significant at the 10% level was further 
investigated and characterized. 
No examinations of subgroups were performed for this study. 
No multiplicity adjustment was required for this study as no formal hypothesis tests were performed. 
There  were  no  efficacy  endpoints  specified  in  this  safety  and  tolerability  study.  COPD  exacerbations, 
rescue  salbutamol  and/or  ipratropium  use,  trough  FEV1,  and  trough  FVC  were  measured  as  safety 
parameters in this long-term safety study. 
Formal  statistical  analyses  were  performed  on  vital  signs,  rescue  salbutamol  and/or  ipratropium  use, 
time  to  first  COPD  exacerbation,  and  trough  FEV1  and  FVC.  No  formal  statistical  analyses  were 
performed for other safety parameters.

influencing the study results. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
Demographic characteristics in the ITT population were generally similar across treatment groups (see 
table  below).  The  majority  of  subjects  were  White  (94%)  and  male  (67%);  the  mean  age  was  61.3 
years.  Eight  percent  of  the  population  was  of  Hispanic  or  Latino  ethnicity.  The  mean  BMI  of  27.91 
kg/m2 indicated that subjects tended to be slightly overweight.

Table 76.  Summary of Demographic Characteristics (DB2113359 ITT Population) 
Smoking History 
Smoking  history  and  smoking  status  were  similar  across  treatment  groups  at  screening  (see  table 
below). Overall, subjects had extensive smoking histories, with a mean of 37.1 years smoked and 41.7 
pack-years  and  63%  of  subjects  were  classified  as  current  smokers  (including  subjects  who  stopped 
smoking within 6 months prior to screening). Few subjects (≤5%) reported changes in smoking status 
at either Month 6 or Month 12 during the study.

COPD History 
COPD  history  was  similar  across  the  treatment  groups  at  Screening;  13%,  39%,  26%,  and  23%  of 
subjects had COPD diagnosed <1 year, ≥1 to <5 years, ≥5 to <10 years, and ≥10 years, respectively, 
prior  to  study  entry  (see  table  below).  Seventy  percent  of  subjects  had  a  diagnosis  of  chronic 
bronchitis  and  67%  had  a  diagnosis  of  emphysema.  Subjects  could  have  had  a  diagnosis  of  both 
chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

In  the  12  months  prior  to  Screening,  the  majority  of  subjects  across  treatment  groups  reported  no 
COPD  exacerbations  requiring  oral/systemic  corticosteroids  and/or  antibiotics  (64%  to  69%)  and  no 
COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization (83% to 86%). 
Screening and Baseline Lung Function 
Subjects  had  moderate  to  severe  airflow  obstruction  at  screening  and  lung  function  parameters  were 
similar across treatment groups (see table below). The overall mean post-salbutamol percent predicted 
FEV1 was 54.7% (range: 54.2% to 55.1% across treatment groups).

Outcomes and estimation 
There  were  no  efficacy  endpoints  specified  in  this  safety  and  tolerability  study.  The  following 
parameters,  however,  were  included  as  safety  assessments:  COPD  exacerbations,  rescue  salbutamol 
and/or ipratropium use, trough FEV1, and trough FVC. 
COPD Exacerbation 
No pre-treatment COPD exacerbations were reported. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  on-treatment  COPD  exacerbation  was  higher  in  the 
placebo  group  (24%)  compared  with  the  UMEC  125  (15%)  or  UMEC/VI  125/25  (13%)  treatment 
groups (see tebale below).

Table 82.  Summary of On-treatment COPD Exacerbations (DB2113359 ITT Population) 
Four  subjects  reported  a  post-treatment  COPD  exacerbation  (2  [2%]  in  the  placebo  group  and  1 
[<1%] each in the UMEC 125 and UMEC/VI 125/25 groups). 
Analysis of time to first COPD exacerbation indicated that treatment with UMEC 125 resulted in a lower 
risk of COPD exacerbation compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.6; CI: 0.3, 1.0, risk reduction 
40%). Treatment with UMEC 125/25 also resulted in a lower risk of COPD exacerbation compared with 
placebo (HR 0.4, CI: 0.3, 0.8, risk reduction 60%) (see table below).

Rescue Salbutamol and/or Ipratropium Use 
The  mean  daily  use  of  rescue  salbutamol/ipratropium  was  2.9,  3.1,  and  3.3  puffs/day  for  the  UMEC 
125, UMEC/VI 125/25, and placebo treatment groups, respectively, at baseline. 
Greater  differences  from  baseline  in  the  mean  number  of  puffs  of  rescue  medication  per  day  over 
Weeks  1  to  52  were  reported  for  subjects  in  both  the  UMEC  125  (-4.0  puffs/day;  95%  CI:  -0.9,0.1) 
and UMEC 125/25 (-1.0 puffs/day; 95% CI: (-1.4,-0.5) treatment groups compared with placebo (see 
table below).

To account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and endpoints, a 
step-down closed testing procedure was applied, whereby inference for a test in 
the predefined hierarchy was dependent upon statistical significance having been 
achieved for previous tests in the hierarchy.  The hierarchy consisted of the 
treatment comparisons for UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs. PLA, UMEC 125 mcg vs. PLA, 
and VI 25 mcg vs. PLA, then UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs. VI 25 mcg and 
UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs. UMEC 125 mcg performed in this order for the primary 
(trough FEV1 on Day 169), followed by the key secondary (TDI focal score at 
Day 168), and then weighted mean FEV1 over 0 to 6 hours at Day 168. 
Analysis of trough FEV1 at Day 169 demonstrated that statistical significance was 
obtained for all comparisons in the testing hierarchy.  
Key secondary analysis  
The ITT Population was the population of primary interest for all efficacy 
endpoints.   
The time point was Day 168 for TDI focal score.

For TDI focal score at Day 168, statistical significance was obtained for 
comparisons of UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg with placebo, but not for UMEC 125 mcg 
compared with placebo.  Therefore, the results of all further statistical analyses 
should be interpreted only descriptively.

To account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and endpoints, a 
step-down closed testing procedure was applied, whereby inference for a test in 
the predefined hierarchy was dependent upon statistical significance having been 
achieved for previous tests in the hierarchy.  The hierarchy consisted of the 
treatment comparisons for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg vs. PLA, UMEC 62.5 mcg vs. 
PLA, and VI 25 mcg vs. PLA, then UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg vs. VI 25 mcg and 
UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg vs. UMEC 62.5 mcg performed in this order for the primary 
(trough FEV1 on Day 169), followed by the key secondary (TDI focal score at 
Day 168), and then weighted mean FEV1 over 0 to 6 hours at Day 168. 
Analysis of trough FEV1 at Day 169 demonstrated that statistical significance was 
obtained for all comparisons in the testing hierarchy.   
Key secondary analysis  
The ITT Population was the population of primary interest for all efficacy 
endpoints.   
The time point was Day 168 for TDI focal score

For TDI focal score at Day 168, statistical significance was obtained for 
comparisons of UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg, UMEC 62.5 mcg, and VI 25 mcg with 
placebo but not for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 compared with VI 25 mcg (or UMEC 62.5 
mcg).  Therefore, the results of all further statistical analyses should be 
interpreted only descriptively.   
Secondary analysis  
The ITT Population was the population of primary interest for all efficacy 
endpoints.   
The time point was Day 168 for 0-6 h weighted mean FEV1.

As a result of the comparison of UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs. UMEC 125 mcg not 
achieving statistical significance at the 5% level for the primary endpoint of 
trough FEV1 at Day 169, the restrictions of the step-down testing procedure were 
not met and, therefore, the results of all further statistical analyses are not 
strictly inferential.

In order to account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and co-primary 
endpoints, a step-down closed testing procedure was applied, whereby inference for a 
test in the predefined hierarchy was dependent upon statistical significance having been 
achieved for previous tests in the hierarchy.  The hierarchy consisted of the following 
4 treatment comparisons, performed in the order listed: 3-h postdose EET for UMEC/VI 
125/25 mcg vs. PLA; trough FEV1 for UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs. PLA 
3-h postdose EET for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg vs. PLA; and trough FEV1 for UMEC/VI 
62.5/25 mcg vs. PLA.  
Analysis of the 3-h postdose EET at Week 12 for the UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs. PLA (first 
comparison in the testing hierarchy) did not demonstrate statistical significance.  
Therefore, the results of all further statistical analyses should be interpreted only 
descriptively.   
Only the comparison of the UMEC/VI 62.5/25 and 125/25 mcg treatments vs. PLA were 
powered.

Notes   
In order to account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and co-primary 
endpoints, a step-down closed testing procedure was applied, whereby inference for a 
test in the predefined hierarchy was dependent upon statistical significance having been 
achieved for previous tests in the hierarchy.  The hierarchy consisted of the following 
4 treatment comparisons, performed in the order listed: 3-h postdose EET for UMEC/VI 
125/25 mcg vs. PLA; trough FEV1 for UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs. PLA 
3-h postdose EET for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg vs. PLA; and trough FEV1 for UMEC/VI 
62.5/25 mcg vs. PLA.  
Analyses of the 3-h postdose EET at Week 12 demonstrated statistical significance for 
both comparisons in the testing hierarchy.   
Only the comparison of the UMEC/VI 62.5/25 and 125/25 mcg treatments vs. PLA were 
powered.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Integration  was  performed  for  the  four  primary  efficacy  studies  as  the  designs  were  very  similar.  A 
separate  integration  was  performed  for  the  two  exercise  studies  as  the  designs  were  identical.  The 
primary  efficacy  and  exercise  studies  were  not  integrated  together  due  to  differences  in  design  and 
duration  of  treatment.  Efficacy  data  from  the  long-term  safety  study  was  not  integrated  with  those 
from  other  studies  as  the  study  was  of  a  different  duration  and  had  a  different  objective.  The 
treatment  comparisons  performed  for  each  endpoint  in  the  integrated  data  were:  each  dose  of 
UMEC/VI and placebo, each dose of UMEC and placebo, VI and placebo, each dose of UMEC/VI and VI, 
and  each  dose  of  UMEC/VI  and  the  relevant  UMEC  dose.  In  addition,  for  the  primary  efficacy  studies 
integration, each dose of UMEC/VI was compared with TIO. No adjustment for multiplicity was made in 
the integrated analysis. 
Studies DB2113361, DB2113373, DB2113360 and DB2113374 
For  the  integrated  analysis,  both  doses  of  UMEC/VI  (62.5/25  and  125/25  mcg)  and  their  respective 
components  demonstrated  statistically  and  clinically  significant  improvements  in  LS  mean  changes 
from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  at  Day  169  compared  with  placebo  (p<0.001;  Table  below).  The 
improvements  in  trough  FEV1  at  Day  169  were  statistically  significant  for  both  doses  of  UMEC/VI 
compared with each respective dose of UMEC, VI, and TIO (p<0.001 for each). However except for the 
comparison  of  UMEC/VI  125/25  with  VI  25,  the  other  comparisons  did  not  reach  the  level  of  clinical 
relevance of 100 ml.

Clinically  meaningful  TDI  focal  scores  relative  to  baseline  were  observed  for  all  treatment  groups, 
including placebo, at Day 168 (see table below). 
Statistically  significant  (p<0.001)  and  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  TDI  focal  scores  (i.e.,  ≥1 
unit) were demonstrated for both doses of UMEC/VI (62.5/25 and 125/25 mcg) compared with placebo

at  Day  168.  UMEC  62.5  mcg,  UMEC  125  mcg,  and  VI  25  mcg  demonstrated  statistically  significant 
greater TDI focal scores compared with placebo at Day 168 (p<0.006). 
Statistically  significant  (p<0.007)  improvements  in  TDI  focal  score  were  observed  for  each  dose  of 
UMEC/VI (62.5/25 and 125/25 mcg) over its respective components at Day 168, with the exception of 
UMEC 62.5/25 mcg over UMEC 62.5 mcg (p=0.194).  
TDI focal scores at Day 168 were similar for both doses of UMEC/VI compared with TIO.

In  the  placebo-controlled  studies  (DB2113361  and  DB2113373),  on-treatment  COPD  exacerbations 
were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  placebo  treatment  group  (13%  to  14%)  compared  with  the 
UMEC/VI, UMEC, and VI treatment groups (6% to 9%) (see table below). 
In  the  TIO  controlled  studies  DB2113360  and  DB2113374,  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  COPD 
exacerbations ranged from 5% to 12% across the UMEC/VI, UMEC, and VI treatment groups compared 
with 5% to 7% in the TIO treatment group. 
For  the  integrated  analysis,  COPD  exacerbations  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  placebo 
treatment group (13%) compared with the UMEC/VI, UMEC, and VI treatment groups (6% to 9%).

Integration of exercise studies 
For the integrated analysis, treatment with either dose of UMEC/VI (62.5/25 and 125/25 mcg) resulted 
in a statistically significant increase in LS mean changes from baseline in 3-hour postdose EET at Week 
12 compared with placebo (p<0.002; see table below). The comparisons of effect of treatment on EET 
as compared to placebo was clinically relevant (defined as 45-65 sec improvement) only for UMEC/VI 
125/25.

For  the  integrated  analysis,  statistically  significant  greater  LS  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  trough 
FEV1 were demonstrated for both doses of UMEC/VI (62.5/25 and 125/25 mcg) compared with placebo 
at Week 12 (p<0.001; see table below).

Sub-group analyses 
The  results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  that  included  the  intrinsic  factors  of  age,  gender,  and  race  and 
the  extrinsic  factors  of  smoking  status,  treatment  naïve  status  and  GOLD  class  (I/II  and  III/IV) 
indicated that there was no impact of these factors on treatment effect. The response to treatment was 
in the same direction and of similar magnitude for each category of subgroup and in the overall COPD 
population. Notably, the bronchodilator response was evident in both GOLD I/II and III/IV subgroups. 
Interactions  with  treatment  were  observed  for the factors  of  geographical  region  and  ICS  use  for  the 
primary  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1.  However,  for  each  of  these  subgroup  categories  (ICS  use  and 
geographical  region)  the  response  to  treatment  was  in  the  same  direction  and  any  differences  in 
magnitude  were  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  For  these  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  factors,  no 
differential in response to UMEC/VI 125/25 and UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg was observed. 
Analysis by reversibility to salbutamol 
For  the  intrinsic  factor  of  reversibility  defined  as  post  salbutamol  improvements  in  FEV1  ≥12%  and 
≥200 mL from baseline, interactions for the primary endpoint of trough FEV1 at Day 169 were found to 
be statistically significant in the integrated analysis of the primary efficacy studies. Although response 
to treatment was in the same direction for each category within each subgroup, the reversible subjects 
showed  a  greater  difference  from  placebo  for  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  (0.282  L  improvement  over 
placebo  at  Day  169)  compared  with  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  mcg  (0.225  L  over  placebo  at  Day  169).  The 
Assessment report

greater improvements in trough FEV1 were observed at Day 2 and maintained for the duration of the 
study. 
Greater benefit with UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg than with UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg in the reversible subgroup 
was  also  apparent  for  TDI  focal  scores  (1.7  and  1.4  unit  improvement  over  placebo  at  Day  169  for 
UMEC /VI 125/25 and 62.5/25 mcg), SGRQ scores (-5.99 and -5.50 reduction over placebo at Day 169 
for  UMEC  /VI  125/25  and  62.5/25  mcg),  and  rescue  salbutamol  use  (-1.82  and  -1.18  puffs/day 
reduction over placebo at Day 169 for UMEC /VI 125/25 and 62.5/25 mcg). 
Both  UMEC/VI  doses  of  62.5/25  and  125/25  mcg  provided  similar  improvements  in  the  broad  COPD 
subject population enrolled in these studies. Greater improvements in efficacy including lung function 
and  reductions  in  rescue  salbutamol  use  were  observed  with  UMEC  125/25  mcg  than  those  observed 
with  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  mcg  in  COPD  patients  who  demonstrated  reversibility  to  salbutamol  at 
screening  (≥200  mL  and  ≥12%  increase  in  FEV1).  In  addition  greater  improvements  with  UMEC/VI 
125/25 mcg than UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg over TIO in TDI and reductions in rescue use were seen in the 
overall  study  population.  Therefore  the  Applicant  initially  proposed  both  doses  of  UMEC/VI  for 
registration. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
All  studies  have  been  conducted  in  a  generally  broad  GOLD  category  type  II  to  IV  COPD  patient 
population. There are no other studies in special populations. A summary of the number of subjects by 
different sub-groups is given in the table below which gives an idea of the mix of the study population.

Methods 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must have met all of the following criteria: 
1.  Type of subject: Outpatient. 
2.  Informed Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent prior to study participation. 
3.  Age: Subjects 40 years of age or older at Visit 1. 
4.  Gender: Male or female subjects. 
5.  Diagnosis:  An  established  clinical  history  of  COPD  in  accordance  with  the  definition  by  the 
American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society [Celli, 2004] as follows: 
Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  is  a  preventable  and  treatable  disease  state 
characterized  by  airflow  limitation  that  is  not  fully  reversible.  The  airflow  limitation  is  usually 
progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious 
particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. 
Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic consequences. 
6.  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of 
≥10 pack-years [number of pack-years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years 
smoked  (e.g.,  20  cigarettes  per  day  for  10  years,  or  10  cigarettes  per  day  for  20  years)]. 
Previous smokers were defined as those who had stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior 
to Visit 1. 
7.  Severity  of  Disease:  A  post-albuterol/salbutamol  FEV1/forced  vital  capacity  (FVC)  ratio  of 
<0.70  and  a  post-albuterol/salbutamol  FEV1  of  ≤70%  of  predicted  normal  values  calculated 
using National Health and Nutritional Examination survey (NHANES) III reference equations at 
Visit 1 [Hankinson, 1999; Hankinson, 2010] 
8.  Dyspnea: A score of ≥2 on the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale at 
Visit 1. 
Exclusion criteria 
Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not have been enrolled in the study: 
1.  Pregnancy:  Women  who were  pregnant  or lactating  or  were planning  on becoming  pregnant 
during the study 
2.  Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma 
3.  Other Respiratory Disorders: Known α-1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung infections (such 
as tuberculosis), and lung cancer were absolute exclusionary conditions. A subject who, in the 
opinion of the investigator, had any other significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD 
was  to  be  excluded.  Examples  may  include  clinically  significant  bronchiectasis,  pulmonary 
hypertension, sarcoidosis, or interstitial lung disease. 
4.  Other  Diseases/Abnormalities:  Subjects  with  historical  or  current  evidence  of  clinically 
significant  cardiovascular,  neurological,  psychiatric,  renal,  hepatic,  immunological,  endocrine 
(including  uncontrolled  diabetes or thyroid  disease),  or  hematological  abnormalities that  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014

uncontrolled  and/or  a  previous  history  of  cancer  in  remission  for  <5  years  prior  to  Visit  1 
(localized carcinoma of the skin that has been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant 
was defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the 
subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the 
disease/condition exacerbated during the study. 
5.  Contraindications:  A  history  of  allergy  or  hypersensitivity  to  any  anticholinergic/muscarinic 
receptor  antagonist,  beta2-agonist,  lactose/milk  protein  or  magnesium  stearate,  or  a  medical 
condition  such  as  narrow-angle  glaucoma,  prostatic  hypertrophy,  or  bladder  neck  obstruction 
that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  study  physician,  contraindicated  study  participation  or  use  of  an 
inhaled anticholinergic. 
6.  Hospitalization: Hospitalization for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1 
7.  Lung Resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to 
Screening (Visit 1) 
8.  12-lead  ECG:  An  abnormal  and  significant  ECG  finding  from  the  12-lead  ECG  conducted  at 
Visit 1, including the presence of a paced rhythm on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) which 
caused the underlying rhythm and ECG to be obscured. Investigators were provided with ECG 
reviews  conducted  by  a  centralized  independent  cardiologist  to  assist  in  evaluation  of  subject 
eligibility.  
9.  Medication  Prior  to  Spirometry:  Unable  to  withhold  albuterol/salbutamol  for  the  4-hour 
period required prior to spirometry testing at each study visit 
10. Oxygen: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as oxygen therapy prescribed for 
greater  than  12  hours  a  day.  As-needed  oxygen  use  (i.e.,  ≤12  hours  per  day)  was  not 
exclusionary. 
11. Nebulized  Therapy:  Regular  use  (prescribed  for  use  every  day,  not  for  as-needed  use)  of 
short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol/salbutamol) via nebulized therapy. 
12. Pulmonary  Rehabilitation  Program:  Participation  in  the  acute  phase  of  a  pulmonary 
rehabilitation  program  within  4  weeks  prior to  Visit 1.  Subjects  who  were  in  the  maintenance 
phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program were not excluded. 
13. Drug or Alcohol Abuse: A known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years 
prior to Visit 1. 
Treatments 
The Applicant provided the study drug for use in this study. The following study drugs were used in this 
study: 
•  UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg once-daily via NDPI + placebo once-daily via HandiHaler 
• 
TIO 18 mcg once-daily via HandiHaler + placebo once-daily via NDPI. 
Subjects were instructed to take one dose each morning from both the NDPI and the HandiHaler. 
On  the  morning  of  each  clinic  study  visit,  subjects  refrained  from  taking  their  morning  dose  of  study 
drug until instructed to do so by clinic personnel. Study drug was given at the clinic at approximately 
the  same  time  of  day  as  Day  1  (Visit  2).  On  the  other  days  during  the  Treatment  Period  (i.e.,  “non-
clinic  days”),  subjects  were  instructed  to  take  their  study  drug  each  morning  at  approximately  the 
same time of day as the dose time on Day 1 (Visit 2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014

UMEC/VI,  and  matching  placebo  (identical  in  appearance  to  the  inhaler  containing  active  study  drug) 
were administered via an NDPI for oral inhalation. The NDPI for UMEC/VI and placebo contained two, 
double-foil, laminate, blister strips within the NDPI. The NDPI provided a total of 30 doses (60 blisters) 
and delivered, when actuated, the contents of a single blister simultaneously from each of the 2 blister 
strips. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder (62.5/25 mcg) once-
daily with tiotropium (18 mcg) once-daily over 24 weeks for the treatment of subjects with COPD. 
Secondary  objectives  were  to  compare  effects  of  UMEC/VI  Inhalation  Powder  (62.5  /25  mcg)  once-
daily with tiotropium (18 mcg) once-daily on safety over 24 weeks in subjects with COPD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  clinic  visit  trough  FEV1  on  Treatment  Day  169.  Trough  FEV1  on 
Treatment  Day  169  was  defined  as  the  mean  of  the  FEV1  values  obtained  at  23  and  24  hours  after 
dosing on Day 168 (i.e., at Week 24). 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  weighted  mean  0-6  hour  FEV1  obtained  post  dose  on  Day 
168. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculations used a 2-sided 5% significance level and an estimate of residual standard 
deviation  (SD)  for  trough  FEV1  of  240  mL.  The  estimate  of  SD  was  based  on  Mixed  Model  Repeated 
Measures  (MMRM)  analyses  of  previous  Phase  IIIA  studies  in  COPD  subjects  (studies  DB2113360, 
DB2113361,  DB2113373  and  DB2113374).  A  study  with  337  evaluable  subjects  per  arm  has  90% 
power to detect a 60 mL difference between treatments in trough FEV1. 
It  was  estimated  that  approximately  25%  of  subjects  could  withdraw  without  providing  a  Week  24 
assessment.  Although,  in  MMRM,  all  available  post-baseline  assessments  up  to  the  endpoint  for 
subjects in the ITT population are utilized in the analysis, data for subjects who withdrew prematurely 
from the study were not explicitly imputed. Hence, to allow for a 25% withdrawal rate, approximately 
450  subjects  were  planned  to  be  randomized  to  each  treatment  arm.  Assuming  30%  of  screened 
subjects  would  not  be  eligible  for  randomization,  approximately  1300  subjects  were  planned  to  be 
screened to randomize 900 for this study. 
Randomisation 
Subjects  were  assigned  to  study  treatment  in  accordance  with  the  randomization  schedule.  The 
randomization  code  was  generated  by  the  Applicant  using  a  validated  computerized  system  RandAll 
version  2.5.  Subjects  were  randomized  using  RAMOS,  an  interactive  voice  response  system  (IVRS). 
This is a telephone based system used by the investigator or designee. 
Once  a  randomization  number  was  assigned  to  a  subject  it  could  not  be  reassigned  to  any  other 
subject in the study. 
Blinding (masking) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 241/308 
 
  
  
The investigator or treating physician may have unblinded a subject’s treatment assignment only in the 
case  of  an  emergency,  when  knowledge  of  the  study  treatment  was  essential  for  the  appropriate 
clinical management or welfare of the subject. 
Statistical methods 
All  planned  analyses  were  performed  after  the  database  freeze  had  taken  place.  Once  this  had  been 
achieved, unblinding of the subjects occurred and analyses were performed. No interim analyses were 
planned or conducted. 
The primary treatment comparison of UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg with tiotropium was performed on trough 
FEV1 on Day 169 and on 0-6 hour weighted mean at Day 168, for the ITT Population.  
Treatment  comparison  of  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  mcg  with  tiotropium  was  performed  for  all  the  other 
efficacy endpoints, for the ITT Population. No further adjustment for multiciplicity was applied. 
No interim analysis was planned or performed. 
The primary endpoint of trough FEV1 on Day 169 was analyzed for the ITT population using a MMRM 
analysis  [Siddiqui,  2009],  including  covariates  of  baseline  FEV1,  smoking  status,  Day,  center  group, 
treatment, Day by baseline interaction, and Day by treatment interaction, where Day is nominal. The 
model used all available trough FEV1 values recorded on Days 2, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168, and 169. 
Missing  data  were  not  directly  imputed  in  this  analysis;  however,  all  non-missing  data  for  a  subject 
were  used  within  the  analysis  to  estimate  the  treatment  effect  for  trough  FEV1  on  Day  169.  Two 
models were fitted; one with a response variable of trough FEV1, and one with a response variable of 
change from baseline in trough FEV1.

Smoking History 
At  screening,  57%  of  subjects  overall  were  classified  as  current  smokers  (including  subjects  who 
stopped smoking within 6 months prior to screening; see table below). During the course of the study, 
one  subject  in  the  TIO  treatment  group  changed  their  smoking  status  from  the  previous  visit.  The 
subject started smoking between the screening Visit and the visit at Day 84.

In the 12 months prior to screening, the majority of subjects (85% and 82% in the UMEC/VI treatment 
group  and  the  TIO  group,  respectively)  reported  no  COPD  exacerbations  requiring  oral/systemic 
corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or hospitalization. In addition, the percentage of subjects who did not 
have a COPD exacerbation resulting in hospitalization in the 12 months prior to screening was similar 
in  both  treatment  groups  (93%  and  94%  in  the  UMEC/VI  treatment  group  and  the  TIO  group, 
respectively). 
Screening and Baseline Lung Function 
Overall,  subjects  had  moderate  to  very  severe  airflow  obstruction  at  screening,  and  lung  function 
parameters were similar across treatment groups (see table below).

Outcomes and estimation 
Trough FEV1 at Day 169: Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was trough FEV1 on Day 169. Trough FEV1 on Day 169 was defined as 
the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 168 (i.e., at the Week 24 
[Day 168] Visit). 
A  statistically  significant  improvement  of  112  mL  in  least  squares  (LS)  mean  change  from  baseline 
trough FEV1 was demonstrated for the UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg treatment group compared with the TIO 
treatment group at Day 169 (see table below).

Weighted Mean FEV1 Over 0 to 6 Hours Postdose at Day 168 (Secondary Endpoint), Day 1, and Day 84 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the 0 to 6 hour postdose weighted mean FEV1 on Day 168. 
A statistically significant improvement in LS mean change from baseline in 0 to 6 hour weighted mean 
FEV1  was  demonstrated  for  the  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  mcg  treatment  group  compared  with  the  TIO 
treatment group at Day 168, as well as at Days 1 and 84 (see table below).

SGRQ total score 
Total  and  SGRQ  domain  scores  at  baseline  are  provided  in  Table  6.51.  Mean  total  SGRQ  scores  at 
baseline were similar across treatment groups (UMEC/VI 49.03, TIO 48.56).  
The results of the analysis of the SGRQ total score at Days 28, 84, and 168 are presented in the table 
below. 
Clinically  meaningful  reductions  from  baseline  in  SGRQ  total  scores  (i.e.,  <-4;  demonstrating  an 
improvement in health-related quality of life [Jones, 2005]) were observed in all treatment groups at 
Days 28, 84, and 168. The treatment difference for UMEC/VI versus TIO was statistically significant at 
all assessments.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The four primary efficacy studies (studies DB2113361, DB2113373, DB2113360 and DB2113374) were 
all  double-blind,  randomized,  controlled  parallel  group  studies.  Two  were  placebo  controlled  and  two 
were active controlled studies. The studies were all multicentre and all started around the beginning of 
2011 and were completed by mid 2012. The studies appear to be well conducted and only one study 
centre  was  detected  to  be  in  serious  breach  of  GCP.  However  only  20  subjects  were  recruited  in  one 
primary  efficacy  study  from  this  centre  and  the  removal  of  the  20  subjects  did  not  impact  on  the 
results.  Therefore  it  is  accepted  that  this  does  not  affect  the  conclusions  drawn  from  the  primary 
efficacy studies. All the four primary efficacy studies evaluated the lung function endpoint of change in 
trough  FEV1  from  baseline  as  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint.  The  symptomatic  endpoint  of  TDI  focal 
score  was  the  key  secondary  endpoint  in  all  the  primary  efficacy  studies.  The  treatment  duration  in 
these  studies  was  24  weeks.  The  primary  efficacy  studies  all  had  at  least  four  treatment  groups  and 
there  were  a  number  of  statistical  comparisons  planned.  Therefore  to  avoid  multiplicity,  a  heirerchal 
system of statistical testing was pre-specified for each study.  
Two  exercise  studies  (studies  DB2114417  and  DB2114418)  have  been  submitted  as  additional 
evidence  of  efficacy.  These  were  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  incomplete-block,  2-
period  cross-over  studies,  where  each  treatment  period  was  for  12  weeks.  These  studies  were  also 
conducted  around  the  same  time  as  the  primary  efficacy  studies  and  appear  to  be  well  conducted. 
These studies had co-primary endpoints of change in exercise endurance time (EET) and trough FEV1. 
The  exercise  studies  also  had  a  number  of  parallel  treatment  arms  in  each  study  and  different 
comparisons  were  planned.  Therefore  to  avoid  multiplicity,  a  heirerchal  system  of  statistical  testing 
was pre-specified for each study.  
In  addition  a  long-term  safety  study  (study  BD2113359)  which  also  collected  data  on  trough  FEV1 
provides  evidence  on  maintenance  of  treatment  effects  over  the  long-term.  This  was  a  double-blind, 
placebo controlled, randomized study for 52 weeks.

During the evaluation, the Applicant presented an additional 24 week active comparator study (study 
ZEP117115) comparing UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg with TIO 18 mcg. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Lung function 
In studies DB2113361 and DB2113373, a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in 
trough  FEV1  was  observed  for  both  UMEC/VI  125/25  and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  as  compared  to  placebo 
(238 mL and 167 mL respectively).  
In study DB2113361, a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in trough FEV1 was 
observed  for  UMEC/VI  125/25  versus  VI  25  (114  mL).  However  a  statistically  significant  but  not 
clinically  relevant  improvement  (defined  as  an  increase  of  100  mL  or  more)  in  trough  FEV1  at  D169 
was  observed  for  UMEC/VI  125/25  versus  UMEC  125  (79  mL).  In  study  DB2113373,  a  statistically 
significant but and close to clinically relevant improvement in trough FEV1 was observed for UMEC/VI 
62.5  mg  versus  VI  25  mg  (95  mL)  but  for  UMEC/VI  62.5  versus  62.5  mg  (52  mL)  the  results  were 
statistically  significant  but  not  clinically  relevant.  The  comparison  of  both  UMEC/VI  125/25  and 
UMEC/VI 62.5/25 over the monocomponents UMEC and VI alone in studies DB2113361 and DB213373 
therefore did not show a statistically significant and also clinically relevant improvement in trough FEV1 
consistently, when a change of 100 mL in trough FEV1 is considered as the minimum clinically relevant 
important difference (MCID). In study DB2113360, a statistically significant but not clinically relevant 
improvement in trough FEV1 at day 169 was observed for both UMEC/VI 125/25 and UMEC/VI 62.5/25 
versus VI 25 (88 mL and 90 mL respectively). In study DB2113374, the improvement in trough FEV1 
at  D169  that  was  observed  for  UMEC/VI  125/25  (37  mL)  and  for  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  (22  mL)  versus 
UMEC 125 was neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant.To summarise, in the four primary 
efficacy  studies  (DB2113361,  DB2113373,  DB2113360  and  DB2113374),  the  improvement  in  trough 
FEV1  at  D169  for  UMEC/VI  versus  UMEC  alone  generally  failed  to  meet  clinical  relevance,  when  a 
change of 100 mL in trough FEV1 is considered as the MCID. This suggests that the contribution of VI 
25  to  the  UMEC/VI  FDC  is  not  clinically  relevant.  The  Applicant  was  therefore  requested  during  the 
evaluation  to  justify  the  clinical  relevance  of  adding  VI  to  the  UMEC/VI  FDC.  For  the  comparison  of 
UMEC/VI  versus  VI  alone,  inconsistent  results  in  terms  of  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  have  been 
observed  amongst  the  studies.  The  Applicant  was  also  requested  to  justify  the  inconsistent  results 
observed.  
The Applicant argued that the bronchodilator effect of UMEC/VI was large with improvements in trough 
FEV1 compared with placebo well in excess of 100 mL, proposed as an MCID for pre-dose trough FEV1 
based on comparisons with baseline or placebo. Across the phase III studies, the treatment differences 
for  comparisons  of  UMEC/VI  with  components  consistently  favoured  the  combination.  However,  the 
range  of  treatment  differences  was  quite  large  and  the  contribution  of  VI  to  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  was 
more marked than for UMEC/VI 125/25. 
For  UMEC/VI  62.5/25,  the  differences  for  comparisons  with  VI  were  large  and  ranged  from  90  to 
132mL  in  the  primary  efficacy  studies  and  the  exercise  studies  (see  table  below).  Treatment 
differences between UMEC/VI 62.5/25 with UMEC 62.5 were also large in the two exercise studies (99 
and  124  mL)  and  more  modest  in  the  study  DB2113373  (52mL).  Overall  the  consistent  benefits  and 
the  magnitude  of  response  observed  with  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  over  its  components  indicate  that  the 
addition of both UMEC 62.5 and VI to the combination produced clinically relevant increases in trough 
FEV1.

Table 115. UMEC/VI  62.5/25:  Data  Evaluating  the  Contribution  of  UMEC  62.5  and  VI  for 
Trough  FEV1  (mL)  (DB2113373,  DB2113360,  DB2114417  and  DB2114418  ITT 
Populations) 
For UMEC/VI 125/25, the treatment differences for comparisons with VI ranged from 70 to 150 mL in 
the primary efficacy and exercise studies which were supportive of a clinically relevant effect of adding 
UMEC 125 to the combination (see table below). Treatment differences between UMEC/VI 125/25 with 
UMEC 125 ranged from 6 to 79 ml (see table below). These results indicate the added benefit of VI to 
UMEC/VI  125/25 is  more variable.  However,  the  results  are  still indicative  of greater  benefit  with the 
combination as all comparisons favoured UMEC/VI 125/25 over UMEC 125. 
Table 116. UMEC/VI  125/25:  Data  Evaluating  the  Contribution  of  UMEC  125  and  VI  for 
Trough FEV1 (ml) (Individual DB2113361, DB2113360, DB2113374, DB2114417 and 
DB2114418 ITT Ppopulation) 
The range of treatment differences for the UMEC/VI 62.5/25 versus UMEC 62.5 alone were 52, 124 and 
99 mL. However the last two values are from the two exercise studies (DB2114417 and DB2114418) 
which have to be accepted with caution as there are unexplained inconsistencies in between the results 
of the two exercise studies and in between the results of the exercise studies and other pivotal studies. 
The range of treatment differences for the UMEC/VI 125/25 to UMEC 125 comparisons are 79, 37, 53,

29  and  6  mL.  Again  the  last  two  values  are  from  the  two  exercise  studies  (DB2114417  and 
DB2114418)  which  have  to  be  accepted  with  caution.  Excluding  the  values  from  the  two  exercise 
studies  (DB2114417  and  DB2114418),  the  difference  for  UME/VIC  125/25  to  UMEC  125  comparison 
are in the range of 37, 53 and 79 mL and for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 to UMEC 62.5 it is 52 mL. Three of the 
four comparisons are less than 53 mL. Moreover the comparator arm here is UMEC alone which is not 
yet  authorised  and  its  clinical  experience  is  limited  to  clinical  studies.  Comparing  the  observed 
improvement in trough FEV1 to published data on another LAMA/LABA FDC, which is reported to have 
better  effects  on  trough  FEV1  in  the  range  of  70-90  mL  when  compared  with  its  monocomponents 
(that are already authorised), the question whether the efficacy of the UMEC/VI FDC is superior (and 
to a clinically relevant extent) to its monocomponents, especially VI, remained.  
The  Applicant  presented  during  the  evaluation,  data  from  two  3-way  cross-over  studies  (study 
DB2116133  and  study  DB2116132).  In  both  studies  DB2116133  and  DB2116132,  a  statistically 
significant improvement in trough FEV1 for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 versus UMEC 62.5 was observed (93 mL 
and  63  mL  respectively).  In  a  subgroup  of  patients  who  were  responsive  to  UMEC  62.5  or  VI  25 
(demonstrated ≥ 12% and 200mL increase from baseline in the 6 hours after receiving the first dose of 
UMEC  or  VI)  in  study  DB2116133,  statistically  significant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  with  UMEC/VI 
62.5/25  versus  UMEC  62.5  were  observed  (83  mL and  133  mL  respectively).  A  potential limitation of 
the  DB2116132  and  DB2116133  studies  is  their  relatively  short  duration  (14  days).  However,  the 
consistency of effect on trough FEV1 from the second day of treatment through week 24 observed for 
UMEC/VI  and  UMEC  in  the  primary  efficacy  studies  (DB2113361,  DB2113373,  DB2113360  and 
DB213374), with the exception of the UMEC 125 response in study DB2113374, provides reassurance 
that  the  treatment  comparisons  from  studies  DB2116132  and  DB2116133  are  indicative  of  those 
obtained  over  longer  time  periods.  In  study  DB2113360,  a  statistically  significant  but  not  clinically 
relevant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  was  observed  for  both  UMEC/VI  125/25  and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25 
versus  TIO  18  (88  mL  and  90  mL  respectively).  In  study  DB2113374,  a  statistically  significant 
improvement but not clinically relevant improvement in trough FEV1 versus TIO 18 was observed for 
UMEC/VI  125/25  (74  mL)  but  not  for  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  (60  mL).  However,  in  study  ZEP117115 
submitted during the evaluation, a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in trough 
FEV1 at D169 was observed with UMEC/VI 62.5/25 versus TIO 18 (112 mL).  
To  summarise,  the  efficacy  data  from  the  four  primary  efficacy  studies  (DB2113361,  DB2113373, 
DB2113360  and  DB2113374)  indicate  that  both  doses  of  UMEC/VI  have  a  statistically  significant  and 
clinically  relevant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  as  compared  to  placebo.  However  the  comparison  of 
both doses of UMEC/VI over the UMEC and VI monocomponents alone did not show a clinically relevant 
change consistently, when a change of 100 mL was considered as the MCID. However it is agreed by 
the  CHMP  that  this  100  mL  MCID  s  for  comparisons  of  the  FDC  versus  placebo  and  may  not  be 
appropriate for the comparison of a FDC of two bronchodilators (a LAMA and a LABA) against only one 
bronchodilator  (either  a  LAMA  or  a  LABA).  It  is  also  noted  that  in  the  recently  approved 
indacaterol/glycopyrronium bromide FDC, for the comparison of the FDC versus the mono-components 
alone,  the  reported  increase  in  trough  FEV1  was  70  and  90  mL  (Bateman  et  al  2013;  Welte  et  al 
2013).  
Based  on  those  results,  for  the  UMEC/VI  FDC,  the  only  comparison  that  generally  failed  to  meet 
consistent  clinical  relevance  was  UMEC/VI  versus  UMEC  alone.  For  the  UMEC/VI  versus  UMEC  alone 
comparison,  the  values  that  were  determined  (without  regard  to  dose  of  UMEC)  in  the  >  24  week 
treatment  duration  studies  were  79 mL,  52  mL,  37  mL  and  53  mL  (studies DB2113361,  DB2113373, 
DB2113374  and  DB2113359).  The  Applicant  justified  these  results  based  on  variability  between 
studies. Furthermore it is accepted that in order to infer on the contribution of each component to the 
FDC,  the  only  method  available  is  to  compare  the  results  of  the  FDC  versus  the  mono-components 
alone  (e.g.  UMEC/VI  versus  UMEC),  derived  from  parallel  arms.  This  comparison  assumes  that  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 256/308 
 
  
  
mono-component (e.g.UMEC) will exert the full effect observed in the mono-component alone (UMEC) 
treatment  arm  when  used  in  the  UMEC/VI  FDC  as  well.  However  it  is  accepted  that  when  two 
bronchodilators are combined together, there will be an overall loss of some effects as a true additive 
effect of bronchodilation is not seen. This suggests that there will be a loss of contribution from each 
component of  the  combination  and  therefore the  comparison  made  to  evaluate  the  contribution  of  VI 
alone (UMEC/VI versus UMEC) is an  under-estimate of the true effect of the contribution of VI alone. 
This justification was considered acceptable by the CHMP. The CHMP also noted that the magnitude of 
the contribution of VI 25 to UMEC/VI 62.5/25 in at least one of these studies is considered comparable 
to  the  indacaterol/glycopryrromium  bromide  results  versus  the  indacaterol  and  glycopyrronium 
bromide monocomponents (90 mL and 70 mL) (Bateman et al 2013; Welte et al 2013).  
To  determine  if  the  combination  of  UMEC/VI  has  a  clinically  meaningful  addition  over  its  mono-
components,  the  CHMP  considered  that the  most  valid  comparison  presented by  the  Applicant  during 
the  evaluation  is  UMEC/VI  versus  TIO,  as  UMEC  and  VI  alone  are  not  yet  authorised.  For  the 
comparison of UMEC/VI 62.5/25 vs TIO, an improvement in trough FEV1 with the FDC of 112 mL, 90 
mL and 60 mL was observed (studies ZEP 117115, DB 2113360 and DB2113374 respectively). Looking 
at  the  effects  on  lung-function  from  baseline,  the  variability  observed  in  the  comparison  UMEC/VI 
versus TIO in the three studies is due to variations in improvement in trough FEV1 in the TIO arm and 
not in the UMEC/VI arm. This is also explained by the fact that at maximal bronchodilation (as can be 
expected with the FDC) the variability is lesser. It should be noted that in study ZEP 117115, a robust 
study  where  the  sample  size  was  larger  than  in  the  other  two  studies  DB2113360  and  DB2113374, 
there were no issues of multiple treatment arms as only UMEC/VI 62.5/25 and TIO were compared. A 
clinically relevant and statistically significant superiority of UMEC/VI as compared to tiotropium on the 
primary endpoint of trough FEV1 was observed in study ZEP117115. These results versus TIO support 
the clinical relevance of lung function changes (improvement in trough FEV1) observed with UMEC/VI 
FDC.  
It  was  also  noted  that  the  effect  of  UMEC  62.5  alone  on  lung  function,  measured  as  the  change  in 
trough FEV1 from baseline, in study DB2113373 was 115 mL which is comparable to the effects of TIO 
which  were  121  mL,  149  mL  and  93  mL  in  studies  DB2113360,  DB2113374  and  ZEP  117115 
respectively.  Therefore  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  the  clinically  meaningful  superiority  of  the 
UMEC/VI FDC versus TIO is due to the additional contribution of VI. 
Taking  all  the  above  observations  in  to  consideration,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  observed 
improvements  in  trough  FEV1  for  UMEC/VI  versus  UMEC  alone  (79  mL,  52  mL,  37  mL  and  53  mL) 
taken together can be considered a clinically meaningful additional contribution. 
Symptomatic endpoints 
In studies DB2113361 and DB2113373, a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in 
transition dyspnoea index (TDI) score at D168 versus placebo was observed for both UMEC/VI 125/25 
and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  (1.0  and  1.2  respectively).  In  study  DB2113360,  no  statistically  significant 
improvement  in  TDI  score  at  D168  was  observed  versus  TIO  18  for  UMEC/VI  125/25  and  UMEC/VI 
62.5/25  (0.5  and  -0.1  respectively).  In  study  DB2113374,  no  statistically  significant  improvement  in 
TDI  socre  at  D168  was  observed  versus  TIO  18  for  UMEC/VI  125/25  and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  (0.3  and 
0.2 respectively). 
In  study  DB2113361,  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  TDI  score  at  D168  was  observed  for 
UMEC/VI 125/25 versus VI 25 (0.5) and vesus UMEC 125 (0.6). In study DB2113373, no statistically 
significant  improvement  in  TDI  score  at  D168  was  observed  for  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  verus  VI  25  (0.4) 
and  UMEC  62.5  (0.3).  In  study  DB2113360,  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  TDI  score  at 
D168 was observed versus VI 25 for only UMEC/VI 125/25 but not for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 (0.8 and 0.2

respectively). In study DB2113374, no statistically significant improvement in TDI score at D168 was 
observed versus UMEC 125 for both UMEC/VI 125/25 and UMEC/VI 62.5/25 (0.5 and 0.4 respectively).  
The Applicant was requested during the evaluation to explain the failure to demonstrate superiority of 
the UMEC/VI  FDC over the UMEC and VI monocomponents on the symptomatic endpoint of focal TDI 
score.  
Evidence  for  the  superiority  of  the  UMEC/VI  over  the  mono-components  alone  for  symptom 
improvement  is  principally  based  on  the  consistency  of  findings  of  numerical  superiority  over  the 
monocomponents for mean TDI scores and the proportion of responders based on TDI score across the 
primary efficacy studies. The Applicant also argued that as TDI focal score is not a true interval scale, 
the  minimum  clinically  important  difference  (MCID)  between  active  treatments  cannot  also  be 
considered  as  1  unit  of  TDI  focal  score.  Any  incremental  benefit  is indicative  of  a  benefit  of  the  FDC. 
Finally, according to the Applicant, the findings for TDI are in line with the results for the primary lung 
function measure of trough FEV1 and the secondary lung function measure of 0-6 hour weighted mean 
FEV1  which  favoured  the  UMEC/VI  FDC  over  its  monocomponents.  The  consistency  of  findings 
favouring  the  UMEC/VI  FDC  across  multiple  endpoints  and  doses  indicates  the  improvements  with 
UMEC/VI are clinically relevant. 
Looking at the range of results achieved for UMEC/VI on TDI, it ranges from 1.8 to 2.9 across studies. 
It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  in  these  studies the  comparator  placebo  and  TIO  alone  also  had  large 
changes in TDI focal score from baseline (1.2 with placebo and 2.2 with TIO). Considering this range, 
the  additional  benefit  of  0.3  to  0.8  for  the  comparison  of  UMEC/VI  FDC  over  its  mono-components 
alone  was  not  considered  impressive.  It  is  agreed  that  UMEC/VI  FDC  was  consistently  shown  to  be 
better  than  the  mono-components  alone,  which  suggests that  this is  not  a  chance  observation,  but a 
definite  numerical  superiority  over  the  mono-components.  However  only  for  two  comparisons  across 
the 8 possible comparisons is the increase in TDI score greater than 0.5 and for 5 of the 8 comparisons 
the 95% CI encompasses 0. In the responder analysis presented by the Applicant, as well, for 5 of the 
8 comparisons available for UMEC/VI versus its monocomponents, the 95% CI encompassed 1.  
The  Applicant  presented  data  from  other  secondary  endpoints  of  time  to  first  COPD  exacerbation, 
SGRQ score and rescue salbutamol use (the only endpoint in which the contribution of VI appeared to 
be  substantial  which  is  not  surprising  considering  that  the  rescue  is  also  a  beta-agonist  like  VI),  all 
these are generally supportive of the numerical superiority of UMEC/VI over the mono-components and 
for  none  of  these  parameters  a  consistently  statistically  significant  benefit  for  UMEC/VI  FDC  over  the 
mono-components have been shown. 
In study ZEP117115, submitted during the evaluation, a clinically meaningful reduction from baseline 
in  SGRQ  total  score  at  D168  was  observed  with  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  versus  TIO  18  (-2.10,  p  = 0.006). 
SGRQ is a disease-specific questionnaire designed to measure the impact of respiratory disease and its 
treatment  on  the  subject’s  health-related  quality  of  life.  To  establish  the  clinical  relevance  of  the 
statistical  significant  results  demonstrated  on  SGRQ  in  this  study,  the  Applicant  presented  also  a 
responder  analysis.  The  responder  analysis  (number  of  patients  who  had  a  -4  change  in  score  from 
baseline)  showed  that  there  were  53%  responders  in  the  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  arm  as  compared  to  the 
46% responders in the TIO 18 arm. Taking in to account the results of the other endpoints measured 
in this study and which are also supportive, it can be concluded that a significant and clinically relevant 
superiority  of  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  as  compared  to  TIO  18  alone  has  been  demonstrated  in  study 
ZEP117115. The proportion of patients who responded with at least the MCID in SGRQ score (defined 
as  a  decrease  of  4 units  from  baseline)  at  Week  24  was  greater  for  UMEC/VI  (49%)  compared  with 
placebo (34%) and each monotherapy component (44% for UMEC and 48% for VI). 
As  UMEC  and  VI  are  not  currently  authorised,  the  comparison  to  TIO  is  the  best  measure  of  clinical 
relevance.  For  the  comparison  of  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  over  TIO  there  are  two  valid  comparisons:  the 
Assessment report

meta-analysis  of  DB2113360  and  DB2113374  and  study  ZEP117115.  In  study  ZEP117115,  a 
statistically  significant  improvement  of  UMEC/VI  over  TIO  on  SGRQ  (-2.10;  p=0.006)  was  shown. 
Whereas in the meta-analysis, the improvement with the UMEC/VI FDC was not significant over TIO on 
TDI  (0.1;  p=0.817).  However  it  should  be  noted  that  the  results  of  ZEP117115  are  considered  more 
robust as this study had only two treatment arms which avoids any issues of multiplicity. In the meta-
analysis,  the  data  from  two  separate  studies  were  combined  and both these  studies  had  4 treatment 
arms. 
Taking  the  overall  data  available,  it  is  accepted  that  both  doses  of  UMEC/VI  showed  a  clinically 
meaningful  and  statistically  significant  improvement  on  symptomatic  endpoint  (TDI  score)  as 
compared  to  placebo.  For  the  comparison  of  UMEC/VI  versus  its  mono-components,  there  is  a 
consistent numerical superiority and the failure to demonstrate statistical significance is probably due 
to the fact that these studies were not powered to demonstrate a smaller magnitude of improvement.  
Of  note  in  the  recently  approved  glycopyrronium/indacaterol  FDC,  a  statistically  significant 
improvement  in  TDI  score  was  observed  over  TIO  and  fluticasone/salmeterol but  not over the  mono-
components  glycopyrronium  and  indacaterol  (Bateman  et  al  2013;  Welte  et  al  2013).  The  above 
results  of  UMEC/VI  are  along  similar  lines  in  that  a  statistically  significant  superiority  over  TIO  for 
SGRQ in study ZEP117115 has been demonstrated but not for TDI in the comparison over the mono-
components/Tio in the other studies.  
For the comparison of UMEC/VI over monocomponents (UMEC or VI) on the symptomatic endpoint of 
TDI, the results show only numerical superiority that was not statistically significant. It is accepted that 
superiority of the FDC over its mono-components is generally difficult to demonstrate on TDI score and 
that  the  magnitude  of  improvement  considered  clinically  relevant  for  such  a  comparison  is  not 
currently established. Therefore, the consistent demonstration of a numerical superiority (although not 
statistically  significant)  of  UMEC/VI  FDC  over  the  mono-components  in  change  in  TDI  score  and  also 
the responder analysis is considered acceptable evidence to demonstrate efficacy of the UMEC/VI FDC 
on symptomatic endpoint. 
Highest strength 
A distinct and clinically relevant improvement in lung function (trough FEV) between UMEC/VI 125/25 
and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  was  not  observed  in  the  four  main  efficacy  studies.  The  comparison  of  both 
UMEC/VI  125/25  and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  over  TIO  in  studies  DB2113360  and  DB2113374  also  did  not 
show  a  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  at  D169,  although  a  consistent  numerical 
improvement  was  shown.  The  lack  of  clinically  significant  and  conclusive  dose-response  between  the 
two doses of UMEC in the phase III studies does not support the need for two different doses of UMEC 
in the UMEC/VI FDC. Moreover the lack of data to provide rational guidance on ‘when and who’ should 
be  treated  with  the  higher  dose  of  UMEC  does  not  support  the  proposed  UMEC/VI  125/25  dose.  The 
reasons  for  the  recommendation  to  use  the  higher  strength  FDC  in patients  responsive  to  salbutamol 
were  considered  unclear. The  Applicant  was  requested  during  the evaluation  to  justify  the  need  for  a 
higher  strength  of  UMEC/VI  and  the  population  which  would  benefit  from  it.  A  statistically  significant 
treatment by reversibility to salbutamol interaction was observed for the primary efficacy endpoint of 
trough FEV1 on D169 in the integrated analysis of the primary efficacy studies. The reversible subjects 
showed  greater  improvements  in  bronchodilation  as  measured  by  trough  FEV1  with  UMEC/VI  125/25 
mcg (282m L improvement over placebo at D169) compared with UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg (225 mL over 
placebo  at  D169).  The  sub-group  analysis  did  show  for  all  the  compared  parameters  that  the  higher 
dose UMEC/VI 125/25 was better than the lower dose UMEC/VI 62.5/25. For the primary endpoint, a 
difference in trough FEV1 of 57ml was seen between the two doses. For the key secondary endpoint of 
TDI focal scores, the difference was 0.3 between the two doses in the sub-group of reversible patients. 
This  difference  was  not  considered  very  compelling.  Even  if  the  sub-group  analysis  is  considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 259/308 
 
  
  
appropriate  this  is  only  a  suggestive  inference  which  must  be  confirmed  in  appropriately  designed 
trials.  In  the  current  clinical  practice,  patients  are  not  generally  assessed  for  reversibility  before 
starting treatments and so the higher dose is unlikely to be appropriately used even if it is considered 
useful  in  the  sub-group.  If  patients  who  do  not  respond  adequately  are  tried  a  higher  dose  without 
testing  for  reversibility  (as  is  likely  to occur  in  clinical  practice),  it  is  likely  that  two-thirds of  patients 
will receive a higher dose unnecessarily, as only one third are expected to be reversible. A distinct and 
clinically relevant improvement in lung function or TDI focal score between the two doses of UMEC/VI 
was not observed. The comparison of both doses of UMEC/VI over active comparator (TIO) also did not 
show  a  clinically  relevant  change  on  trough  FEV1,  although  a  consistent  numerical  superiority  was 
shown in response. As the clinical benefit of the UMEC/VI 125/25 dose was not considered conclusively 
demonstrated by the CHMP, the Applicant decided to withdraw this strength during the evaluation. The 
Applicant’s decision to only pursue the UMEC/VI 62.5/25 lower dose was supported by the CHMP. 
Long term study 
In  study  DB2113359,  treatment  with  UMEC  125/25  resulted  in  a  lower  risk  of  COPD  exacerbation 
compared with placebo (HR 0.4, CI: 0.3, 0.8, risk reduction 60%). Trough FEV1 at 6 months: UMEC/VI 
125/25 demonstrated greater mean LS change from baseline in trough FEV1 compared to placebo at 6 
and 12 months (the difference versus placebo was 197 mL and 231 mL respectively). 
Exercise endurance studies 
In study DB2114417, no statistically significant improvement in exercise endurance time (EET) at week 
12  was  observed  versus  placebo  for  both  UMEC/VI  125/25  and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  (32.4  and  32.9 
respectively).  However  in  study  DB2114418,  statistically  significant  improvement  in  EET  at  week  12 
was  observed  versus  placebo  for  both  UMEC/VI  125/25  and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  (65.8  and  69.4 
respectively). 
In study DB2114417, no statistically significant improvement in EET at week 12 was observed versus 
UMEC 125 and VI 25 for UMEC/VI 125/25 (19.3 and 42.4 respectively). Also no statistically significant 
improvement in EET at week 12 was observed versus UMEC 62.5 and VI 25 for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 (-4.6 
and 31.9 respectively). In study DB2114418, no statistically significant improvement in EET at week 12 
was observed versus UMEC 125 and VI 25 for UMEC/VI 125/25 (-8.9 and 35.2 respectively). Also no 
statistically significant improvement in EET at week 12 was observed versus UMEC 62.5 and VI 25 for 
UMEC/VI 62.5/25 (44.4 and 38.8 respectively). 
In  study  DB2114417,  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  at 
Week  12  was  observed  versus  placebo  for  both  UMEC/VI  125/25  and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  (169  mL  and 
211  mL  respectively).  In  study  DB2114418,  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant 
improvement in trough FEV1 at Week 12 was observed versus placebo for both UMEC/VI 125/25 and 
UMEC/VI 62.5/25 (261 mL and 243 mL respectively).  
In study DB2114417, no statistically significant nor clinically relevant improvement in trough FEV1 at 
week  12  was  observed  for  UMEC/VI  125/25  versus  UMEC  125  and  VI  25  (29  mL  and  70  mL 
respectively).  For  UMEC/VI  62.5/25,  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  improvement  in 
trough  FEV1  at  week  12  was  oberserved  versus  UMEC  62.5  and  VI  25  (124  mL  and  111  mL 
respectively).  
In  study  DB2114418,  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  at 
week 12 was observed for UMEC/VI 125/25 versus VI 25 (150 mL) but not versus UMEC 125 (6 mL). 
For  UMEC/VI  62.5/25,  a  statistically  significant  and clinically  relevant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  at 
week 12 was observed versus UMEC 62.5 and VI 25 (99 mL and 132 mL respectively).

The results of the exercise endurance studies DB2114417 and DB2114418 are inconsistent with each 
other and a number of inconsistencies within the results of each individual study have been observed. 
In study DB2114417, no statistical significant or clinically relevant improvement in EET at week 12 for 
both UMEC/VI arms as compared to placebo (first step of the heirerchal testing) was shown and hence 
this  study  was  a  failed  study  and  no  inferences  can  be  drawn.  In  study  DB2114418,  both  doses  of 
UMEC/VI were seen to be statistically and clinically (based on MCID of 45-85 sec) better as compared 
to placebo. For the comparison of the UMEC/VI FDC against the mono-components alone UMEC and VI, 
a significant effect on EET was not seen.  
In  both  studies,  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  at  week 
12 was observerved for both UMEC/VI arms versus placebo. No consistent results have been observed 
in studies DB2114417 and DB2114418 on trough FEV at week 12 for both UMEC/VI stremgths versus 
UMEC 125 or 62.5 and VI 25 alone. Due to the difference in populations,the cross-over nature of the 
studies,  their  shorter  duration  (12  weeks)  the  hitherto  unexplained  inconsistent  results  observed  on 
trough FEV1 in these two studies should be interpreted with caution. 
Indication 
As  all  the  efficacy  studies  predominantly  included  subjects  from  the  GOLD  category  B  (88%)  and  as 
consequence  any  conclusions  drawn  are  likely  to  be  applicable  to  this  subset  only.  However  the 
claimed  indication  would  allow  all  four  GOLD  categories  to  be  treated  with  the  combination  as  a  first 
line treatment. During the evaluation the Applicant was requested to justify the indication claimed. The 
Applicant  did  clarify  that  the  estimate  of  88%  of  subjects  falling  in  to  Group  B  was  based  on  partial 
data (mMRC score and exacerbations). When all relevant data (including airflow limitation) was added, 
58%  subjects  were  group  D  and  42%  were  Group  B.  A  reasonable  proportion  of  subjects  across  the 
grade II-IV (GOLD grading based on spirometry) was represented in the studied population. Therefore 
it was accepted by the CHMP that the results are likely to be relevant to the broad COPD population. 
The Applicant also presented an analysis of the trough FEV1 effects in patients identified as treatment 
naïve and compared it with the effects in patients not identified as treatment naïve. The effects in both 
groups  are  comparable.  A  first  line  indication  in  COPD  was  recently  granted  for  the  first  authorised 
LAMA/LABA FDC. Therefore a first-line indication is considered acceptable for UMEC/VI FDC. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  results  of  studies  DB2113361  and  DB2113373  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  and  statistically 
significant improvement in both the primary endpoint (trough FEV1) and the secondary endpoint (TDI 
focal score) with both doses of UMEC/VI as compared to placebo.  
However when UMEC/VI was compared to the mono-therapies alone (UMEC or VI) or to TIO alone, the 
improvement  observed  on  trough  FEV1  was  quite  variable.  It  is  accepted  that  UMEC/VI  62.5/25 
demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in lung function (trough 
FEV1) as compared to TIO, which is the current standard treatment of COPD: 112 mL, 90 mL and 60 
mL  in  studies  ZEP  117115,  DB  2113360  and  DB2113374  respectively.  The  major  extent of  variability 
observed in FEV1 improvement seems to be due to TIO and not to UMEC/VI. As a combination of two 
bronchodilators will probably be providing maximal bronchodilation, the effects of UMEC/VI are at the 
top-end  of  a  dose  response  curve  as  compared  to  TIO  alone,  explaining  this  observed  variability. 
Furthermore,  of  the  three  studies  listed  above,  study  ZEP  117115  submitted  by  the  Applicant  during 
the evaluation was considered by the CHMP the most robust as only two treatments were compared as 
apposed  to  4  treatment  arms  in  studies  DB2113360  and  DB2113374,  which  may  cause  issues  of 
multiplicity and balancing at base line.

The comparison of UMEC/VI 62.5/25 versus VI 25 (contribution of UMEC 62.5) was 95 mL and 90 mL 
in  studies  DB2113373  and  DB2113360,  respectively.  These  improvements  in  lung  function  (trough 
FEV1) were considered a clinically relevant contribution considering that this is an underestimation of 
the  actual  contribution  of  the  UMEC/VI  FDC.  Similarly,  although  there  were  some  questions  raised 
during  the  evaluation,  the  observed  improvements  in  trough  FEV1  for  UMEC/VI  versus  UMEC  alone 
(contribution of VI alone) of 79 mL, 52 mL, 37 mL and 53 mL, taken together, were considered by the 
CHMP as an acceptable additional contribution of clinical relevance. 
With  regards  to  improvement  in  symptomatic  endpoints  (TDI  and  SGRQ),  three  sets  of  data  were 
relevant  to  measure  the  effects  of  UMEC/VI  62.5/25:  study  DB2113373,  a  meta-analysis  of  studies 
DB2113360  and  DB2113374  and  finally,  ZEP117115,  submitted  during  the  evaluation.  In  study 
DB2113373,  a  numerical  superiority  in  the  TDI  score  of  UMEC/VI  over  UMEC  (0.3;  p=0.244)  or  VI 
(0.4;  p=0.117)  was  observed.  In  the  meta-analysis  of  studies  DB2113360  and  DB2113374,  a 
numerical superiority of UMEC/VI over UMEC (0.4; p=0.147), VI (0.2; p=0.475) or TIO (0.1; p=0.817) 
was shown. In study ZEP117115, a statistically significant superiority in SGRQ of UMEC/VI over TIO (-
2.10; p=0.006) was demonstrated. To establish the clinical relevance of the numerical superiority, the 
Applicant  presented  a  responder  analysis  (number  of  patients  who  had  a  -4  change  in  score  from 
baseline).  It  showed  that  there  were  53%  responders  in  the  UMEC/VI  arm  as  compared  to  the  46% 
responders in the TIO arm. Taking into account the results of all the endpoints from this study, it can 
be accepted that a significant and clinically relevant superiority of UMEC/VI as compared to TIO alone 
was  shown.  TIO  is  a  well  established  monotherapy  in  the  treatment  of  COPD  and  is  the  widely  used 
and established LAMA. Based on the results of study ZEP117115, it was concluded by the CHMP that a 
clinically  relevant  symptomatic  benefit  with  the  UMEC/VI  FDC  as  compared  to  tiotropium  was 
considered demonstrated. 
Taking into account that initially conducted active-controlled studies had smaller sample size and there 
were  multiple  treatment  arms  in  those  studies  which  complicated  treatment  comparisons  and 
inferences,  it  can  be  accepted  that  study  ZEP117115  is  more  reliable.  Furthermore,  the  initially 
conducted  studies  did  show  numerical  superiority  of  UMEC/VI  over  TIO  although  not  to  a  clinically 
relevant extent. Therefore based on the results of all three active controlled studies taken together, it 
can still be accepted that UMEC/VI has a clinically meaningful better effects on symptomatic endpoint 
than TIO and the monocomponents alone. 
A  distinct  and  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  lung  function  or  TDI  focal  score  between  the  two 
doses of UMEC/VI was not observed. The comparison of both doses of UMEC/VI over active comparator 
(TIO)  also  did  not  show  a  clinically  relevant  change  on  trough  FEV1,  although  a  consistent  numerical 
superiority  was  shown  in  response.  As  the  clinical  benefit  of  the  UMEC/VI  125/25  dose  was  not 
considered  conclusively  demonstrated  by  the  CHMP,  the  Applicant  decided  to  withdraw  this  strength 
during  the  evaluation.  The  Applicant’s  decision  to  only  pursue  the  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  lower  dose  was 
supported by the CHMP. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The four 6-month Primary Efficacy  Studies underpin the conclusions about the safety data supporting 
the use of UMEC/VI in the treatment of COPD. Given the similarity in study design and duration, safety 
data from the Primary Efficacy Studies were integrated. These integrated data comprise the majority of 
the safety information and are the focus of the data in this report.  
Data  on  the  long-term  safety  of  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  and  UMEC  125  mcg  was  obtained  in  the  52-
week placebo-controlled long-term safety study (study DB2113359) and is also discussed as this is the 
only data available on the long-term safety of UMEC/VI.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 262/308 
 
  
  
Additional  safety  information  was  obtained  from  a  separate  integration  of  the  two  3-month  Exercise 
studies.  Additional  studies  of  at  least  4  weeks  duration  were  included  in  an  integrated  analysis  along 
with the studies described above to provide further safety information on UMEC monotherapy (studies 
AC4115408 and AC4113589) and VI monotherapy (studies B2C111045, HZC112206, and HZC112207) 
(All  COPD  Studies,  integration  of  14  studies).  Only  the  relevant  highlights  from  these  studies  will  be 
discussed in the report.  
Safety data from clinical pharmacology studies and phase II studies of UMEC and UMEC/VI, studies of 
VI in COPD and asthma also provide additional safety information. These data did not reveal any new 
adverse  effects  or  any  marked  changes  in  severity,  duration  or  frequency  of  adverse  effects  and 
therefore not discussed in detail in this report.  
The  safety  concerns  with  UMEC/VI  relate  to  pharmacological  effects  often  associated  with  muscarinic 
antagonists and beta agonists. Pharmacologic class effects that have been associated with muscarinic 
antagonists  include  cardiovascular  effects  (atrial  arrhythmias),  ocular  disorders  (e.g.,  blurred  vision), 
urinary  retention,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  and  gallbladder  disorders,  along  with  anticholinergic 
effects including dry mouth, cough, etc.  
Pharmacologic class effects that have been associated with beta agonists include cardiovascular effects 
(increased  heart  rate,  prolonged  QT  interval,  cardiac  rhythm  abnormalities,  palpitations,  and 
myocardial ischemia), metabolic effects (low potassium and elevated glucose), and tremor. In addition, 
pneumonia  and  lower  respiratory  tract  infections  (LRTIs)  are  commonly  reported  in  patients  with 
COPD.  The  potential  for  UMEC/VI  treatment  to  result  in  these  effects  has  been  evaluated  in  the 
UMEC/VI  clinical  development  program  through  evaluation  of  Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest 
(AESI),  12-lead  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  and  Holter  assessments,  vital  signs,  and  clinical  chemistry 
and hematology laboratory measures. 
In pre-clinical studies, gallbladder distension accompanied by myofibre degeneration/regeneration was 
observed in one 14 day dog study. This was not observed in longer term studies in dog.  
Patient exposure 
As of 22 August 2012, a total of 2454 COPD subjects were treated with UMEC/VI (62.5/25 or 125/25 
mcg) in the UMEC/VI clinical development program. A total of 1124 COPD subjects were treated with 
UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg and 1330 COPD subjects were treated with UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg. In addition, 
576  subjects  received  UMEC  62.5  and  1087  subjects  received  UMEC  125  mcg,  and  2501  subjects 
received VI 25 mcg compared with 1637 subjects receiving placebo and 423 subjects receiving TIO in 
all  of  the  integrated  COPD  studies  (14  studies).  The  summary  of  subject  exposure  (all  COPD  clinical 
studies ITT population) is provided in the table below.

As  seen  from  the  above  table,  only  the  primary  efficacy  studies,  long-term  safety  study  and  the 
exercise studies involved use of the combination UMEC/VI. 
In the 14 integrated COPD studies, exposure to study drug for >48 weeks was reported for 146 (11%) 
subjects  in  the  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  treatment  group,  133  (12%)  subjects  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg 
treatment  group,  and  590  (24%)  subjects  in  the  VI  25  mcg  treatment  group.  This  exposure  came 
primarily  from  the  long-term  safety  study  (study  DB2113359)  and  the  exacerbation  studies  (studies 
HZC102871  and  HZC102970).  The  summary  of  exposure  from  all  COPD  studies  is  presented  in  the

Table 122. Summary  of  Adverse  Events  (DB2113361,  DB2113373,  DB2113360, 
DB2113374 ITT Population) 
Approximately half of the subject population reported at least 1 on-treatment AE across all treatment 
groups (ranging from 50% to 55% for the UMEC/VI, UMEC, and VI treatment groups, 48% for placebo, 
and  49%  for  TIO).  The  incidences  of  fatal  AEs  and  other  SAEs,  as  well  as  AEs  leading  to  permanent 
discontinuation  or  withdrawal  were  low  and  similar  across  all  UMEC/VI  and  component  treatment 
groups  when  compared  with  placebo  and  TIO.  The  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  was  low  across  the 
UMEC/VI and component treatment groups (UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg (6%), UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg (7%), 
UMEC 62.5 mcg (8%), VI 25 mcg (7%) and the placebo (6%) and TIO (5%) treatment groups. 
For  the  long-term  safety  study,  the  summary  of  adverse  events  is  presented  in  the  below  table.  The 
incidence  of  on-  and  post-treatment  drug-related  AEs  (12%  to  13%)  and  on-treatment  SAEs  (6%  to 
7%)  was  similar  across  all  treatment  groups  including  placebo.  Adverse events  leading  to permanent 
discontinuation  or  withdrawal  were  reported  for  9%  and  8%,  respectively,  in the  UMEC  125  mcg  and 
UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg treatment groups compared with 12% for placebo. Fatal AEs were reported for 4 
subjects in the UMEC 125 mcg treatment group (2%) and 1 subject (<1%) in the placebo group.

In  the  primary  efficacy  studies,  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  headache  (6-10%)  and 
nasopharyngitis (7 to 9%) with similar incidences across all treatment groups including placebo. These 
are common conditions across the general population. The common AEs (reported by ≥3% of subjects 
in any treatment group) are summarized in the below table. 
Table 126. Summary  of  On-Treatment  Adverse  Events  Reported  by  3%  or  More  of 
Subjects Within Any Treatment Group 
Cough,  pharyngitis,  dry  mouth,  and  constipation  were  the  only  on-treatment  AEs  reported  by  more 
than  1%  of  subjects  in  any  UMEC/VI  treatment  group  and  having  an  incidence  in  any  UMEC/VI 
treatment group greater than 1% over the placebo incidence as shown in the below table.

Of  the  AEs  observed  with  an  incidence  less  than  1%  but  greater  than  placebo,  only  atrial  fibrillation 
and  tachycardia  are  considered  to  potentially  be  related  to  UMEC/VI.  All  of  these  AEs  are  in  the 
proposed  prescribing  information  for  UMEC/VI  and  could  potentially  be  related  to  either  a  LAMA  or  a 
LABA. 
For  the  integrated  safety  data  from  all  COPD  clinical  studies,  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  AEs 
reported by ≥3% is provided in the table below. This was similar across all treatment groups. The most 
frequently  reported  AEs  were  nasopharyngitis  and  headache,  with  incidences  across  all  treatment 
groups ranging from 7% to 10%, and 6% to 10%, respectively (170 to 219 and 139 to 231 subjects, 
respectively, per 1000 subject-years of exposure).

Overall,  21  of  4733  subjects  (<1%)  died  during  the  treatment  or  post-treatment  periods  of  the 
Primary Efficacy Studies. An additional post-treatment death related to worsening painful lymph nodes 
in the neck was reported after study closure for a subject in the placebo group of 1 study, bringing the 
total  number  of  deaths  to  22.  The  incidence  of  any  fatal  AE  was  similar  (<1%)  across  all  treatment 
groups including UMEC/VI, UMEC, VI, placebo, and TIO. 
One  fatal  AE  was  considered  related  to  treatment  by  the  investigator,  an  SAE  of  sudden  death 
experienced in the VI 25 mcg treatment group in one study (study DB2113373). 
Each  of  the  22  fatalities  was  adjudicated  by  an  external  independent  and  blinded  adjudication 
committee.  The  adjudication  committee  members  were  asked  to  indicate  the  primary  cause  of  death 
(cardiovascular,  respiratory,  cancer,  other  cause  of  death,  or  unknown)  and  further  select  a 
subcategory  corresponding  to  the  primary  cause  of  death.  The  incidence  of  adjudicated  fatal  serious

investigator. 
None  of  the  SAEs  reported  during  the  treatment  or  post-treatment  periods  were  assessed  by  the 
investigator as possibly related to the study treatment. 
The  most  frequently  occurring  on-treatment  SAEs  in  the  UMEC/VI  group  were  in  the  following 
categories:  benign,  malignant  and  unspecified  neoplasms  (5  subjects,  1%),  respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal  disorders  (2  subjects,  <1%),  infections  and  infestations  (3  subjects,  <1%),  hepatobiliary 
disorders  (2  subjects,  <1%)  and  cardiac  disorders (1  subject,  <1%).    For  subjects in  the  TIO  group, 
the most frequently occurring on-treatment SAEs were in the following categories: neoplasms benign, 
malignant  and  unspecified  (2  subjects,  <1%),  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (4 
subjects,  <1%),  infections  and  infestations  (2  subjects,  <1%),  hepatobiliary  disorders  (2  subjects, 
<1%) and cardiac disorders (2 subjects, <1%).   
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
The  main  safety  concerns  with  UMEC/VI  relate  to  the  known  LAMA  and  LABA  effects.  Pharmacologic 
class effects of LAMA include cardiovascular effects (atrial arrhythmias), ocular disorders (e.g., blurred 
vision),  urinary  retention,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  and  gallbladder  disorders,  along  with 
anticholinergic  effects  including  dry  mouth,  cough.  Pharmacologic  class  effects  of  LABAs  include 
cardiovascular (increased heart rate, prolonged QT interval, cardiac rhythm abnormalities, palpitations, 
and  myocardial  ischemia),  metabolic  (low  potassium  and  elevated  glucose),  and  tremor  effects.  In 
addition,  pneumonia  and  lower  respiratory  tract  infections  (LRTIs)  are  commonly  reported  in  patients 
with COPD. These AESIs were proactively assessed (i.e., defined a priori) in the UMEC/VI COPD clinical 
development program through an evaluation of AESIs. 
From the clinical pharmacology studies, the expected incidence is low and therefore only the integrated 
study results are discussed below. 
Cardiovascular AESI and MACE analysis 
The  below  table  presents  the  incidence  and  exposure-adjusted  frequencies  of  subjects  with  on 
treatment cardiovascular AESIs by special interest subgroup for the All COPD Clinical Studies Grouping. 
Cardiac arrhythmias were the most commonly experienced subgroup of cardiovascular AESIs, followed 
by  hypertension  and  cardiac  ischemia.  The  incidence  of  subjects  with  an  event  in  the  cardiac 
arrhythmias special interest subgroup ranged from 2% (UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg and TIO) to 6% (UMEC 
125  mcg).  Among  exposure  adjusted  frequencies  in  the  cardiac  arrhythmias  subgroup,  placebo  and 
UMEC  125  mcg  had  the  highest  frequencies  at  131  and  134  subjects,  respectively,  with  events  per 
1000  subject-years  of  exposure.  Hypertension  as  a  special  interest  subgroup  was  reported  in  2%  to 
3%  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  and  cardiac  ischemia  as  a  special  interest  subgroup  was 
reported in ≤2% of subjects in each treatment group. Overall, while differing incidences and exposure-
adjusted  frequencies  of  subjects  with  events  were  observed  for  some  cardiovascular  special  interest 
subgroups across treatment groups, no dose- or treatment-related patterns were identified.

Ischaemic Heart Disease SMQ) excluding fatalities 
o  Stroke  Special  Interest  AE  Subgroup  (Central  Nervous  System  Haemorrhages  and

To investigate events relating specifically to myocardial infarction rather than  other cardiac ischaemic 
events,  the  narrow  MACE  definition  included  only  the  PTs  of  “myocardial  ischaemia”  and  “acute 
myocardial infarction” 
In  the  broad-definition  MACE  analysis  (i.e.,  including  non-fatal  cardiac  ischaemia  AESIs),  the  MACEs 
were low and similar across treatment groups (1% to 2%). From the narrow-definition MACE analysis, 
the incidences were low (<1%) in all treatment groups. In both there was a higher exposure-adjusted 
frequency in the placebo group as compared to the treatment groups.  
Study ZEP117115 
AEs  in  the  cardiovascular  category  were  reported  in  9  subjects  (2%)  subjects  in  the  UMEC/VI  group 
and  in  7  subjects  (2%)  in  the  TIO  group.  AEs  in  the  pneumonia  and  lower  respiratory  tract  infection 
category were reported for 4 subjects (<1%) in the UMEC/VI group and for 6 subjects (1%) in the TIO 
group.  All  individual  AEs  in  the  AE  of  special  interest  were  reported  in  <1%  of  subjects  in  both  the 
UMEC/VI and the TIO treatment groups. 
Effects on Potassium AESIs 
In  the  All  COPD  Clinical  Studies  Grouping,  the  incidence  of  events  in  the  effects  on  potassium  AESI 
group was <1% in all treatment groups including placebo and included the PTs “hypokalaemia” and 
“hyperkalaemia.”  The  highest  exposure-adjusted  frequencies  of  this  AESI  group  and  of  the  2  PTs 
included therein (hyperkalemia and hypokalemia) were in subjects treated with placebo. 
Effects on Glucose AESIs 
In  all  study  groupings,  the  incidence  of  post-treatment  effects  on  glucose  AESIs  was  <1%  for  each 
treatment.  No  dose-  or  treatment-related  patterns  were  identified  in  either  incidence  or  exposure-
adjusted frequencies of subjects with on-treatment effects on glucose AESIs by PT. 
Tremor AESIs: 
In  the  All  COPD  Clinical  Studies  Grouping,  the  incidence  was  <2%  in  all  treatment  groups  including 
placebo and the events were described by the PTs “essential tremor” and “tremor. While differences 
in incidence and exposure-adjusted frequencies of subjects with events were observed for some tremor 
special interest events across treatment groups, no dose or treatment-related patterns were identified 
Urinary Retention AESIs 
In  the  all  COPD  clinical  studies  grouping,  the  incidence  of  urinary  retention  AESIs  was  <1%  in  all 
treatment  groups  including  placebo.  While  there  were  no  events  reported  in  the  placebo  group, 
UMEC/VI 125/25 and UMEC 62.5, there were 2, 2 and 3 events respectively in the UMEC/VI 62.5/25, 
UMEC 125 and VI groups.  
Ocular effects AESIs 
In all study groupings, the incidence of on-treatment ocular effects AESIs was ≤1% in any treatment 
group.  The  exposure-adjusted  frequency  of  these  events  was  highest  (24.2  events  per  1000  subject 
years)  in  the  UMEC  125  group,  however  the  exposure-adjusted  frequency  in  the  UMEC/VI  125/25 
group  was  lower  than  in  placebo.  No  dose-  or  treatment-related  patterns  were  identified  in  either 
incidence  or  exposure-adjusted  frequencies  of  on-treatment  AEs  in  the  ocular  effects  special  interest 
group by PT. 
Gall bladder disorders AESIs 
In  all  study  groupings,  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  events  in  the  gallbladder  disorders  special

identified in either incidence or exposure-adjusted frequencies of on-treatment AEs in this AESI group. 
Intestinal obstruction AESIs 
In all study groupings, the incidence of on-treatment events in the intestinal obstruction effects special 
interest  group  was  <1%  in  any  treatment  group.  No  intestinal  obstruction  on-treatment  AESIs  were 
reported  in  the  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  group,  either  UMEC  dose  group  or  the  TIO  group.  No  dose-  or 
treatment-related  patterns  were  identified  in  either  incidence  or  exposure-adjusted  frequencies  of 
subjects with on-treatment AEs in this special interest group. 
Anticholinergic effects AESIs 
Pharmacologic class effects of LAMAs include anticholinergic effects. The anticholinergic syndrome SMQ 
was used to search for these events since it contained the most pertinent PTs for a broad evaluation of 
anticholinergic  effects,  although  the  search  was  not  aimed  at  looking  for  anticholinergic  syndrome, 
which  is  an  acute  effect  in  the  elderly.  For  this  reason,  the  AESI  category  has  been  renamed 
“anticholinergic effects.” 
In the  All COPD Clinical Studies Grouping, the incidence of on-treatment anticholinergic effects AESIs 
was  3%  to  4%  across  all  groups  and  the  exposure-adjusted  frequencies  were  similar  in  all  groups 
including placebo and VI.

Clinical Studies ITT Population) 
LRTI and Pneumonia AESIs 
In  the  All  COPD  Clinical  Studies  Grouping,  the  highest  incidence  and  exposure-adjusted  frequency  of 
LRTI  and  pneumonia  AESIs  were  among  subjects  treated  with  VI  25  mcg  (5%,  95  subjects  with  an 
event per 1000 subject-years of exposure, respectively) and TIO (4%, 98 subjects with an event per 
1000 subject-years of exposure), respectively. Notably, the incidence of these AESIs was the same in 
the  combination  UMEC/VI  treatment  groups  and  placebo  (2%)  and  the  exposure-adjusted  frequency 
were similar as well (54-66 subjects with an event per 1000 subject-years of exposure). 
In a subgroup analysis in the primary efficacy studies, based on ICS users at screening, the UMEC/VI 
125/25 mcg, UMEC 125 mcg, and TIO treatment groups (2% of subjects in each treatment) reported a 
higher  incidence of  the  AE  term  of “pneumonia”  compared  with  placebo  (<1%)  whereas  in the  ICS 
non- users subgroup, the incidence of “pneumonia” was <1% across all treatment groups including 
placebo and TIO. 
QTc interval 
No definite dose-related signals were detected from the analysis of ECG and holter monitoring data in 
the phase III studies.  
Withdrawal effects and rebound

In  the  clinical  development  programs  reported  in  this  application,  subjects  may  have  resumed  their 
original  maintenance  therapy  following  participation  in  the  studies.  Unless  other  appropriate 
medications  are  prescribed  upon  discontinuation  of  treatment,  the  expected  effect  of  withdrawal  of 
study medication is an increase in signs and symptoms of COPD. 
The clinical trials in the UMEC/VI development program were designed with a post-treatment follow-up 
period  to  evaluate  AEs  following  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  and  to  assess  any  withdrawal 
effects.  From  the  available  data,  there  was  no  indication  of  withdrawal  effects  or  rebound  following 
discontinuation of UMEC/VI based on evaluation of post-treatment AE reports. However, subjects may 
have  been  prescribed  alternate  COPD  medication,  which  makes  interpretation  of  post  treatment  AE 
data difficult. 
Laboratory findings 
Glucose and potassium 
Hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia are recognised effects with some beta2-agonists and are generally 
related  to  systemic  exposure.  In  the  primary  efficacy  studies,  pre-dose  non-fasting  glucose  and 
potassium  were  collected  as  part  of  the  clinical  laboratory  tests  at  screening,  Month 3,  and  Month  6 
and  additionally  at  Month 9  and  Month  12  in  the  UMEC/VI  long-term  study  as  well  as  at  the  end  of 
each  12-week  treatment  period  in  the  Exercise  Studies.  There  was  no  indication  from  the  routine 
laboratory  evaluations  in  the  COPD  program  of  a  clinically  remarkable  treatment-related  or  dose-
related effect on glucose or potassium in the studies with UMEC/VI, UMEC, or VI.  
For  most  patients  (≥83%)  in  the  primary  efficacy  studies,  glucose  levels  remained  unchanged  or 
shifted  to  normal  compared  with  baseline  at  any  time  point  post-baseline.  Over  the  UMEC/VI,  UMEC, 
and VI treatment groups, shifts to high glucose were reported for 12% to 15% of patients respectively; 
compared with placebo (14%) and TIO (13%).   
The percentage of patients with shifts from baseline to low potassium at any time point post-baseline 
was  <1%  to  1%  and  similar  across  the  UMEC/VI  and  component  treatment  groups  compared  with 
placebo (2%) and TIO (<1%). 
Liver events 
Liver  chemistry  [trial/treatment]  stopping  and  follow  up  criteria  were  established  a  priori  as  defined 
below  for  alanine  transaminase  (ALT)  and  bilirubin  using  the  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  and/or  the 
international normalised ratio (INR): 
•  ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) (or ALT ≥3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR 
measured) 
•  ALT ≥8xULN 
•  ALT ≥5xULN but <8xULN persists for ≥2 weeks 
•  ALT  ≥3xULN  if  associated  with  the  appearance  or  worsening  of  symptoms  of  hepatitis  or 
hypersensitivity  such  as  fatigue,  nausea,  vomiting,  right  upper  quadrant  pain  or  tenderness, 
fever, rash, or eosinophilia 
•  ALT ≥5xULN but <8xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for >2 weeks. 
Any  events  of  possible  drug-induced  liver  injury  with  hyperbilirubinemia  (defined  as  ALT 3xULN  plus 
bilirubin  2xULN  and/or  INR>1.5)  or  Hy’s  Law  events,  required  immediate  study  drug  cessation  and 
reporting as an SAE.

Three patients, one each in the UMEC 62.5 mcg group, the UMEC 125 mcg group, and the TIO group, 
were reported by the investigator as having liver events that exceeded the a priori stopping criteria; all 
were  withdrawn  from  the  study.  Brief  descriptions  of  these  events  are  provided  below.  The  two 
patients on UMEC treatments had significant co-existing biliary disease.

Haematology 
At  any  time  post-baseline,  the  majority of  patients  (≥84%)  had  hematology  values  within  the  normal 
range or had no change from baseline with respect to the normal range. Analytes for patients with the 
highest incidence of shifts to high or low relative to the normal range at any time point post-baseline 
were eosinophils (to low) , lymphocytes (to low), and segmented neutrophils (to high). However, the 
percentages  of  patients  with  abnormal  values  were  generally  low  (≤13%)  and  similar  across  all 
treatment groups. There were no apparent treatment-related differences in the percentage of patients 
with shifts between baseline and any time post-baseline relative to the normal range for hematology.   
Vital signs 
Maximum or minimum post-baseline mean changes from baseline in vital signs were small and similar 
across all treatment groups (see table below).

Based  on  the  review  of  shifts  with  respect  to  the  normal  reference  range  for  hematology  and  clinical 
chemistry  analytes,  no  trends  were  observed  suggesting  an  effect  of  UMEC/VI  or  its  individual 
components  (UMEC  and  VI)  on  the  occurrence  of  laboratory  values  outside  the  normal  range.  This 
included  serum  glucose  and  potassium  and  hepatic  tests.  Except  for  liver  chemistry,  the  laboratory 
data  were  not  integrated  for  the  ‘all  COPD  clinical  studies  grouping’.  Overall,  no  UMEC/VI  or  VI 
associated  changes  in  liver  function  tests  of  potential  clinical  concern  were  observed  in  the  COPD 
clinical  development  program.  The  few  episodes  of  liver  abnormalities  were  generally  transient  or 
confounded by concurrent medical problems or concomitant medications. 
Safety in special populations 
There  were  no  remarkable  differences  in  the  pattern  of  incidence  of  on-treatment  AE,  drug-related 
AEs, SAEs, or AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal across treatments 
for subjects ≤64 years of age, 65 to 74 years of age, or 75 to 84 years of age compared with the ITT 
population. However the number of subjects ≥85 years of age was small (n=14 total) and therefore it 
is difficult to make conclusions on these data. 
To ensure that the development and evaluation of UMEC/VI takes into account specific safety aspects 
related to aging, in accordance with current guidelines [ICH E7, 2012], the incidence of AEs of special 
concern  for  the  elderly,  including  CNS  (confusion/extrapyramidal)  AEs,  events  related  to  falling, 
cardiovascular events, cerebrovascular events and infections were categorized based on age in a post 
hoc summary (see table below). 
There were no remarkable differences in the pattern of incidence of on-treatment AEs related to CNS, 
falling, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or infections across treatments for subjects ≤64 years of age, 
65 to 74 years of age, or 75 to 84 years of age compared with the ITT population.

DB2113373, DB2113360, DB2113374 ITT Population) 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
UMEC and UMEC/VI were generally well tolerated when coadministered with verapamil, a P-gp inhibitor 
and moderate CYP450 inhibitor, and VI was well tolerated when coadministered with oral ketoconazole 
400 mg, a potent CYP450 inhibitor, as monotherapy and as FF/VI. There were no clinically significant 
findings  with  respect  to  the  AE  profile,  safety  laboratory  results,  vital  signs  assessments,  or  12-lead 
ECG  measures  in  these  studies.  There  were  no  effects  of  ketoconazole  on  any  pharmacodynamic 
endpoints  relative  to  VI  compared  with  placebo.  UMEC  was  also  well  tolerated  in  both  healthy  and 
CYP2D6 poor metabolizer populations. No dose adjustment is warranted for UMEC/VI with the use of P-
gp  inhibitors  or  inhibitors  of  CYP2D6.  Caution  should  be  exercised  when  considering  the  co-
administration  of  UMEC/VI  with  ketoconazole  and  other  known  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  as  there  is 
potential for increased cardiovascular adverse effects. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The subject disposition in the primary efficacy studies, long-term safety study and the exercise studies 
have  been  presented  under  the  section  of  main  studies.  Given  below  is  the  subject  disposition  which 
gives information on the discontinuation due to AES from all COPD clinical studies.

A total of 8138 subjects were randomized and included in the ITT population for the All COPD Clinical 
Studies  (see  table  below).  The  majority  of  subjects  completed  the  study  (74%  to  82%  across  the 
UMEC/VI, UMEC, and VI treatment groups versus 74% for placebo and 83% for TIO). Overall, the most 
common  primary  reasons  for  withdrawal  were  lack  of  efficacy  (4%  to  7%  across  the  UMEC/VI  and 
component  treatment  groups  versus.  10%  for  placebo  and  5%  for  TIO)  and  AEs  (6%  to  7%  across 
UMEC/VI  and  component  treatment  groups  versus  6%  for  placebo  and  5%  for  TIO).  Lack  of  efficacy 
due to COPD exacerbation was reported by 4% to 6% of subjects across the UMEC/VI and component 
treatment groups compared with 7% for the placebo group and 4% for the TIO group. 
Table 142. Overall Subject Disposition (All COPD Clinical Studies ITT Population) 
However in the long-term safety study, a different trend was seen which may be of some concern.

In  the  long-term  study,  a  larger  proportion  of  the  patients  in  the  treatment  groups  reached  the 
protocol  specified  stopping  criteria  as  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  This  is  a  trend  only  in  the 
longer-term study. The withdrawals were due to ECG abnormalities or holter abnormalities.  
Study ZEP117115 
On-treatment AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal were reported for 
17 subjects (4%) in the UMEC/VI group and for 10 subjects (2%) in the TIO group.  
The most frequently occurring AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal in 
the UMEC/VI group were in the following categories; neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (6 
subjects, 1%) and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3 subjects, <1%).  For subjects in 
the TIO group, the most frequently occurring AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug 
or withdrawal were categorized as respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (4 subjects, <1%). 
In  the  analyses  of  change  from  baseline  in  vital  signs,  there  were  occasional  statistically  significant 
comparisons between the UMEC/VI  and TIO; however, LS mean changes from baseline were small at 
all time points, similar across treatment groups, and not considered to be clinically relevant.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of UMEC/VI FDC is based on 6,855 patients with COPD. This includes 2,908 
patients  who  received  UMEC/VI  once  daily  in  the  phase  III  clinical  studies,  of  whom  1,578  patients 
received the recommended dose of 62.5/25 mcg in 24 week studies (studies DB2113373, DB2113360, 
DB2113374 and ZEP117115) 1,104 patients received a higher dose of UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg (UMEC at 
twice  the  recommended  dose  and  VI  at  the  recommended  dose)  in  the  24  week  studies  (studies 
DB2113361,  DB2113360,  DB2113374)  and  226  patients  received  125/25  mcg  in  one  52  week  study 
(study DB2113359). 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  UMEC/VI  is  in  line  with  the  safety  profile  of  other  approved  LAMAs  and 
LABAs.  The  common  adverse  events  with  an  incidence  of  at  least  1%  in  the  UMEC/VI  group  and  a 
greater  incidence  (by  at  least  1%)  as  compared  to  placebo  or  with  a  plausible  causative  link  to  the 
treatment  included  cough,  pharyngitis,  URTI,  nasopharyngitis,  sinusitis,  oropharyngeal  pain,  dry 
mouth,  UTI,  headhache  and  constipation.  Adverse  events  with  incidence  less  than  1%  but  with  a 
greater  incidence  in  the  UMEC/VI  group  as  compared  to  placebo  include  atrial  fibrillation, 
supraventricular  tachycardia,  rhythm  idioventricular,  tachycardia,  supraventricular  extrasystoles  and 
rash.   
The incidence of drug related serious adverse events were low and were comparable across treatment 
groups. No particular dose-related or treatment related trends were seen for any of the adverse events 
of special interests. A distinct difference in safety profile between the lower dose and the higher dose 
of  UMEC/VI  was  not  observed  from  these  studies.  Similarly  no  distinctive  difference  in  safety  profile 
between  the  combination  (UMEC/VI)  and  the  monocomponents  (UMEC  and  VI  alone)  were  observed 
from these studies.  
In the overall COPD patient population safety analysis, it was noted that the death rate for VI 25 mcg 
was 17.3/1,000 patient years, the highest of any treatment group. Most of the fatal events were from 
studies HZC102871 and HZC102970, in which VI was given with fluticasone furoate (FF). The Applicant 
was  requested  during  the  evaluation  to  discuss  the  narratives  of  these  events  including  whether 
treatment was with FF/VI or with VI alone. The Applicant clarified that only data from subjects that did 
not receive FF with VI were included from studies HZC102871 and HZC102970. Data from the VI only 
arms and/or placebo arms of five FF/VI studies were included in a pooled analysis with 9 studies from 
the UMEC/VI program (all COPD studies grouping). In this analysis, the death rate in the VI arm was 
slightly  higher  at  17.3/1,000  patient  years.  Studies  HZC102871  and  HZC102970  from  the  FF/VI 
programme  were  52  week  exacerbation  studies.  It  should  be  noted  that  these  studies  included 
subjects with more severe COPD which may have contributed to the higher death rate. When VI data 
from  FF/VI  studies  are  removed  from  the  All  COPD  grouping,  the  percentage  of  deaths  is  similar  for 
each treatment group. Clinical narratives for deaths in the VI 25mcg treatment arm were provided by 
the Applicant as requested by the CHMP. Listings for all fatal events by treatment groups from the ‘All 
COPD  studies’  grouping  were  also  provided.  From  the  narratives,  the  majority  of  the  reported  events 
were  those  that  commonly  occur  in  an  older  population  of  subjects  or  that  are  frequently  seen  in 
subjects with COPD, and were mostly associated with the Cardiac Disorders and Respiratory, Thoracic, 
and Mediastinal Disorders system organ classes. Smoking-related disease also confounds these cases. 
All  fatal  cases  apart  from  one  were  considered  unrelated  by  the  investigator.  The  Applicant’s 
clarifications were considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
The adequacy of the overall evidence on long-term safety for the mono-components and the UMEC/VI 
FDC  especially  due  to  the  potential  'safety  signals  (cardiovascular  safety  &  pneumonia/LRTI)  was 
questioned during the evaluation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 289/308 
 
  
  
The Applicant clarified during the evaluation that there were no specific exclusion criteria regarding CV 
risk  in  the  UMEC/VI  phase  3  studies.  In  the  primary  efficacy  studies  and  the  long-term  safety  study, 
the majority of subjects (55 - 68% in each treatment group) reported at least one CV risk factor, 18 - 
35%  reported  a  current  cardiac  disorder  and  approximately  half  (49%)  of  the  subjects  were  current 
smokers. In addition, patients with a past medical history of myocardial infarction (5-6%) and stroke 
(<1%-4%) were included in the primary efficacy studies and long-term safety study. The prevalence of 
these  cardiovascular  conditions  were  comparable  to  the  estimates  reported  for  COPD  patients  who 
were managed for their disease Therefore, patients with significant cardiovascular disease at screening 
were included in the UMEC/VI studies. 
An  assessment  of  UMEC/VI’s  and  UMEC’s  safety  profile  according  to  the  presence/absence  of 
cardiovascular  risk  factors  at  screening  was  conducted  for  the  ITT  population  in  the  primary  efficacy 
studies  and  the  long-term  safety  study.  The  results  of  this  assessment  showed  that  there  were  no 
remarkable differences in the overall pattern of adverse events across treatment groups based on the 
presence/absence  of  a  cardiovascular  risk  factor  at  screening,  compared  with  the  ITT  population  in 
either  the  primary  efficacy  studies  or  the  long-term  safety  study.  Occasional  differences  in  the 
incidence  of  subjects  with  CV  AESIs  across  treatment  groups  were  observed,  but  did  not  show  an 
additive effect with the combination over individual components or a dose response in subjects with or 
without a cardiovascular risk factor at screening.  
Although  a  higher  number  of  patient  withdrawals  were  noted  in  the  long-term  safety  sudy  (study 
DB2113359)  due to  Holter/ECG  abnormalities in  the  active  treatment groups compared  with  placebo, 
the majority of the ECG abnormalities leading to withdrawal were unlikely to have lead to more severe 
cardiovascular  events.  None  of  these  ECG  or  Holter  withdrawals  was  associated  with  any  concurrent 
clinically  relevant  symptoms.  Overall  withdrawal  rates  were  similar  between  the  placebo  group  and 
active  treatments.  The  results  of  the  long-term  safety  study  are  considered  applicable  to  the  broad 
COPD patient population including those with severe cardiovascular disease.  
The  number  of  cardiovascular  events  occurring  in  the  UMEC/VI  studies  were  generally  small  and 
moreover do not show any consistent dose-related trends for the two doses of UMEC or UMEC/VI. The 
reported events have been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC and caution is advised when UMEC/VI 
is used in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders is 
included  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  Further  data  will  also  be  collected  in  study 
WWE117397 as described in the RMP. Finally the CHMP also requested the Applicant to conduct a post-
authorisation  safety  study  to  further  further  investigate  the  risk  of  selected  cardiovascular  and 
cerebrovascular  events  with  UMEC/VI  compared  with  TIO  in  the  treatment  of  COPD  (as  described  in 
the RMP).  
The  number  of  cases  of  pneumonia  and  LRTI  are  comparable  across  different  treatment  arms  and 
appears to be in line with the incidence expected in this population. There are no dose-related trends 
seen for either UMEC or UMEC/VI in this database.  
No dose adjustment is warranted for UMEC/VI with the use of P-gp inhibitors or inhibitors of CYP2D6. 
Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of UMEC/VI with ketoconazole and 
other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors as there is potential for increased cardiovascular adverse effects. 
Only  one  study  (study  DB2113359)  provided  long-term  safety  data  (52  weeks)  for  UMEC/VI  125/25. 
This study included 562 patients (ITT population). No long-term safety data on UMEC/VI 62.5/25 was 
presented.  It  was  highlighted  that  the  long-term  safety  data  presented  by  the  Applicant  just  about 
meets  the  requirements  of  ICH  E1  “The  extent  of  population  exposure  to  assess  clinical  safety  for 
drugs intended for long-term treatment of non-life threatening conditions”. During the evaluation, the 
Applicant presented additional data from a new long-term safety study (study DB2115362) in Japanese 
Assessment report

patients.  In  this  new  study,  which  was  open  label,  112  subjects  were  treated  during  52  weeks  with 
UMEC/VI 125/25. No new safety concern has been identified in this new study. 
The safety data from UMEC/VI 125/25 is only supportive of the long-term safety of UMEC/VI 62.5/25, 
the only strength pursued by the Applicant. The CHMP concluded that the overall exposure in the UMEC 
& VI treatment arms as well as the UMEC/VI treatment arms across the studies is in line with ICH E1 
requirements. However, long-term safety will be further characterized as part of the post-authorisation 
safety study that the Applicant was requested to conduct. 
In  addition  study  DB2113359  did  not  include  subjects  with  very  severe  airflow  obstruction.  Subjects 
with post-salbutmaol FEV1 ≥35% to < 80% only were included and moreover these subjects were not 
required  to  be  symptomatic.  In  clinical  practice,  it  is  likely  that  the  combination  of  UMEC/VI  will  be 
used in a generally more severe and symptomatic population than the population included in the long-
term  safety  study.  The  Applicant  was  requested  during  the  evaluation  to  comment  on  that.  The 
Applicant  acknowledged  that  the  long-term  safety  study  did  not  include  the  very  severe  COPD  cases 
and that the patients included did not need to be symptomatic. However, despite this, a broad range of 
patients  including  severe  COPD  patients  have  been  included  in  study  DB2113359  as  seen  from  the 
baseline  GOLD  staging,  ICS  use  and  hospitalisation  data.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  safety  data 
presented does not give rise to any significant safety concerns. It is acknowledged that the long-term 
study DB2113359 did not include very severe patients of COPD.  However it is accepted by the CHMP 
that this was to ensure safety of the study population in a placebo controlled study. This exclusion of 
very severe COPD patients is not uncommon in long-term placebo controlled studies. Long-term safety 
is  included  as  missing  information  in  the  RMP  and  will  be  further  characterized  as  part  of  the  post-
authorisation safety study that the Applicant was requested to conduct. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of UMEC/VI is in line with the safety profile of other LAMAs and LABAs. 
The incidence of drug related serious adverse events were low and were comparable across treatment 
groups. No particular dose-related or treatment related trends were seen for any of the adverse events 
of special interests. A distinct difference in safety profile between the lower dose and the higher dose 
of  UMEC/VI  was  not  observed  from  these  studies.  Similarly  no  distinctive  difference  in  safety  profile 
between  the  combination  (UMEC/VI)  and  the  monocomponents  (UMEC  and  VI  alone)  were  observed 
from these studies.  
Although  a  higher  number  of  patient  withdrawals  were  noted  in  the  long-term  safety  sudy  due  to 
Holter/ECG  abnormalities  in  the  active  treatment  groups  compared  with  placebo,  the  majority  of  the 
ECG  abnormalities  leading  to  withdrawal  were  unlikely  to  have  lead  to  more  severe  cardiovascular 
events. None of these ECG or Holter withdrawals was associated with any concurrent clinically relevant 
symptoms. Overall withdrawal rates were similar between the placebo group and active treatments. 
The  number  of  cardiovascular  events  occurring  in  the  UMEC/VI  studies  were  generally  small  and 
moreover  do  not  show  any  consistent  dose-related  trends  for  the  two  doses  of  UMEC  or  UMEC/VI. 
Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders is included an important potential risk in the RMP and a 
caution  statement  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  Further  data  will  also  be  collected  in  study 
WWE117397 and in the PASS as described in the RMP.  
Only  one  study  provided long-term  safety  data  (52 weeks)  for  UMEC/VI  125/25.  No  long-term  safety 
data on UMEC/VI 62.5/25 was presented. Long-term safety is included as missing information in RMP 
and will be further characterized as part of the PASS (as described in the RMP).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
A  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  superiority  of  UMEC/VI  FDC  over  placebo  on  both  the 
lung  function  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1  and  the  symptomatic  endpoint  of  TDI  was  shown  during  the 
clinical  development  program.  The  combination  of  UMEC/VI  has  also  consistently  demonstrated  a 
numerical superiority over the UMEC and VI mono-components alone or TIO alone) in both the primary 
endpoint of trough FEV1 and key secondary endpoint of TDI focal score.  
On  the  lung  function  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1,  the  improvement  in  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  over  VI  alone 
(contribution  of  UMEC)  was  95  mL  and  90  mL  in  studies  DB2113373  and  DB2113360.  This  is  a 
clinically  relevant  and  statistically  significant  improvement.  Similarly  for  the  comparison  of  UMEC/VI 
62.5/25  over  tiotropium,  an  improvement  in  trough  FEV  of  112  mL,  90  mL  and  60ml  in  studies  ZEP 
117115,  DB  2113360  and  DB2113374  respectively  were  observed.  The  variability  observed  in 
improvements of trough FEV1 of UMEC/VI versus TIO is mainly due to the variability in improvement in 
trough  FEV1  with  TIO  and  overall  it  is  accepted  that  the  improvement  in  trough  FEV  observed  with 
UMEC/VI are clinically relevant and significant. 
For  the  comparison  of  UMEC/VI  versus  UMEC  (contribution  of  VI),  the  observed  improvements  in 
trough FEV1 were 79 mL, 52 mL, 37 mL and 53 mL (studies DB2113361, DB2113373, DB2113374 and 
DB2113359  respectively).  Taken  together  these  improvements  in  lung  function  are  considered  an 
acceptable  additional  contribution  that  is  clinically  meaningful  in  the  context  of  the  UMEC/VI  FDC  as 
compared  to    UMEC,  VI  or  TIO  alone,  which  is  the  standard  therapy  currently  established  in  clinical 
practice. 
With  regards  to  symptomatic  endpoints,  for  the  comparison  of  UMEC/VI  (including  both  dose 
strengths)  over  UMEC  alone,  VI  alone  or  TIO  alone,  there  are  three  sets  of  data  on  TDI  score  (the 
primary  symptomatic  endpoint)  and  one  set  on  SGRQ  (the  secondary  symptomatic  endpoint).  Of  the 
three sets of TDI score available, in one study (DB2113361) statistical significant results for UMEC/VI 
FDC  over  UMEC  and  VI  alone  was  demonstrated.  The  magnitude  of  difference  for  the  comparison 
UMEC/VI against UMEC or VI alone was 0.5 and 0.6 respectively. In a second study (DB2113373), the 
results for the combination over the mono-components were not statistically significant (these results 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 302/308 
 
 
  
  
cannot  therefore be  considered  as  conclusive).  The  numerical  difference  observed  for  the  comparison 
UMEC/VI  FDC  against  UMEC  or  VI  alone  was  0.3  and  0.4  respectively.  For the  third  comparison from 
the  meta-analysis  of  the  active  controlled  studies,  none  of  the  comparisons  of  UMEC/VI  62.25  over 
UMEC,  VI  or  TIO  alone  was  statistically  significant.  The  difference  were  0.4,  02  and  0.1  respectively, 
while  for  the  comparisons  of  the  higher  dose  UMEC/VI  125/25  over  UMEC,  VI  or  TIO  alone,  only  the 
comparison  over  UMEC  was  statistically  significant.  The  differences  observed  were  0.8,  0.6  and  0.4 
respectively.  In  the  recently  submitted  study  ZEP117115  where  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  was  compared  to 
TIO, a significant difference was shown for SGRQ (-2.1).  
Overall,  from  4  sets  of  symptomatic  data,  there  were  two  sets  that  were  significant  and  two  that 
showed  numerical  superiority  for  UMEC/VI.  Taking  into  consideration  the  difficulty  to  demonstrate  a 
clinically important difference when compared to other active treatments, the Applicant has presented 
responder  analysis  for  the  symptomatic  endpoint  TDI  which  shows  the  clinical  relevance  of  UMEC/VI 
over the mono-components alone and TIO, the current standard LAMA monotherapy. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
For a new FDC like UMEC/VI, a clinically relevant and statistically significant superiority over the mono-
components on both a lung function endpoint and a symptomatic endpoint should be demonstrated.  
On  the  lung  function  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1,  the  results  observed  were  mixed,  with  some 
comparisons  showing  a  clinically  relevant  and  statistically  significant  superiority  whereas  others  did 
not. Taking all the results together for the comparison of UMEC/VI versus UMEC alone (contribution of 
VI), the improvement in trough FEV1 was somewhere between 45 – 60 mL. In the integrated analysis 
of  primary  efficacy  studies,  the  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  for  the  comparison  of  UMEC/VI  versus 
UMEC alone was 64 mLs pointed out by the Applicant, these comparisons of calculating the difference 
between  the  FDC  and  one  mono-component  (to  infer  on  the  contribution  of  the  other  mono-
component), assume that the effect seen in the monotherapy arm will be fully seen in the combination 
arm,  which  is  not  true  for  combination  of  two  bronchodilators.  The  effects  of  a  combination  of  two 
bronchodilators seem to be less than the additive effects of the two components, which suggest there 
is  a  loss  of  effect  of  each  component  when  they  are  used  in  combination.  Therefore  this  method  of 
estimation gives an under-estimate of the true contribution of VI alone. Also, it has been conclusively 
shown  that  UMEC/VI  has  a  clinically  relevant  and  significant  benefit  over  TIO  and  that  cross-study 
comparisons  show  that  the  effects  of  UMEC  alone  and  TIO  alone  are  comparable.  Taking  all  these 
factors  in  to  consideration,  it  can  be  accepted  that  the  contribution  of  VI  to  the  combination  is 
significant and clinically relevant. 
A distinct and clinically relevant improvement in lung function (trough FEV) between UMEC/VI 125/25 
and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  was  not  observed  in  the  four  main  efficacy  studies.  The  comparison  of  both 
UMEC/VI  125/25  and  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  over  TIO  in  studies  DB2113360  and  DB2113374  also  did  not 
show  a  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  at  D169,  although  a  consistent  numerical 
improvement  was  shown.  The  lack  of  clinically  significant  and  conclusive  dose-response  between  the 
two doses of UMEC in the phase III studies does not support the need for two different doses of UMEC 
in  the  UMEC/VI  FDC.  The  Applicant’s  decision  to  only  pursue  the  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  lower  dose  was 
supported by the CHMP. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The overall incidence of drug related adverse events in the primary efficacy studies was around 6-10% 
in  all  treatment  groups.  The  incidence  of  drug  related  adverse  events  in  the  treatment  groups  as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 303/308 
 
  
  
compared  to  the  placebo  groups  was  comparable  or  a  small  increase  in  the  treatment  groups  was 
noted.  There  were  no  drug  related  SAEs  in  the  placebo  group,  TIO  group  and  the  UMEC/VI  125/25 
groups and less than 1% incidence in the other treatment groups.  
In  the  primary  efficacy  studies,  the  common  adverse  events  with  an  incidence  of  at  least  1%  in  the 
UMEC/VI  group  and  a  greater  incidence  (by  at  least  1%)  as  compared  to  placebo  or  with  a  plausible 
causative  link  to  the  treatment  included  cough,  pharyngitis,  URTI,  nasopharyngitis,  sinusitis, 
oropharyngeal  pain,  dry mouth,  UTI,  headhache  and  constipation.  Adverse events  with  incidence less 
than  1%  but  with  a  greater  incidence  in  the  UMEC/VI  group  as  compared  to  placebo  include  atrial 
fibrillation,  supraventricular 
tachycardia,  rhythm 
idioventricular, 
tachycardia,  supraventricular 
extrasystoles and rash. All of these AEs which could potentially be related to either a LAMA or a LABA 
are included in the UMEC/VI SmPC. 
In general the number of drug related adverse events was low and the reported events do not give rise 
to  any  major  safety  concerns.  A  definite  dose-related  signal  was  not  detected  for  any  significant 
adverse  event  in  the  safety  database  presented  for  UMEC/VI.  There  were  numerical  differences 
between treatment groups for many of the adverse events but a definite conclusive trend was not seen 
for any treatment group on any significant adverse event.  
In the recently concluded 24-week active control study ZEP117115, the safety profile of UMEC/VI was 
comparable to that of TIO and the safety profile was consistent with that determined in earlier studies. 
There were no new safety signals that were reported from this study. 
When the incidence of adverse events in the UMEC/VI was compared to the monocomponents (UMEC 
or  VI)  or  TIO,  there  were  no  significant  event  that  conclusively  had  a  higher  incidence  in  the 
combination  as  compared  to  the  monocomponents  or  TIO.  From  the  available  data  there  is  no 
indication  that  the  safety  concerns  are  higher  with  UMEC/VI  FDC  as  compared  to  the  mono-
components UMEC or VI alone or TIO. But it must be remembered that the mono-components are not 
yet authorised and hence there is no safety experience with their use in clinical practice.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The overall available data on long-term safety (>48 weeks) is considered limited. The total long-term 
exposure (>48 weeks) for UMEC/VI, UMEC and  VI are 148, 133 and 590 patients respectively. Given 
that  the  COPD  population  often  have  other  co-morbidities,  the  potential  for  long-term  significant 
adverse events is limited for UMEC and VI.  In addition, neither UMEC nor VI is currently authrorised. 
Long-term safety is will be further characterized as part of the PASS (as described in the RMP). 
Although  a  higher  number  of  patient  withdrawals  were  noted  in  the  long-term  safety  sudy  due  to 
Holter/ECG  abnormalities  in  the  active  treatment  groups  compared  with  placebo,  the  majority  of  the 
ECG  abnormalities  leading  to  withdrawal  were  unlikely  to  have  lead  to  more  severe  cardiovascular 
events. None of these ECG or Holter withdrawals was associated with any concurrent clinically relevant 
symptoms. Overall withdrawal rates were similar between the placebo group and active treatments. 
The  number  of  cardiovascular  events  occurring  in  the  UMEC/VI  studies  were  generally  small  and 
moreover  do  not  show  any  consistent  dose-related  trends  for  the  two  doses  of  UMEC  or  UMEC/VI. 
Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders is included an important potential risk in the RMP and a 
caution  statement  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  Further  data  will  also  be  collected  in  study 
WWE117397 and in the PASS as described in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 304/308 
 
  
  
The benefits of UMEC/VI FDC on lung function endpoint (trough FEV1) and symptomatic endpoint (TDI 
score)  have  been  shown  to  be  consistently,  numerically  larger  than  the  mono-component  treatment 
arms and also than TIO (marginally on TDI). What level of increase in the lung function endpoint and 
symptomatic endpoint, over and above what is seen with the treatment of either LAMA or LABA alone, 
can  be  considered  as  clinically  relevant,  has  not  yet  been  establised.  However  it  is  important  to 
demonstrate that the UMEC/VI FDC is superior to its mono-components in a convincing and compelling 
manner  to  offset  the  potential  additional  risk  of  adding  another  active  substance  to  the  long-term 
treatment  of  the  patient,  although  no  such  increased  risk  has  been  seen  in  the  UMEC/VI  clinical 
development so far.  
On  the  symptomatic  endpoint,  a  statistically  significant  result  on  TDI  was  demonstrated  for  UMEC/VI 
over the mono-components UMEC or VI alone and in another study a statistically significant result on 
SGRQ was demonstrated for UMEC/VI over TIO. While in two other studies numerical superiority of the 
symptomatic endpoint of TDI was shown for UMEC/VI over monocomponents and TIO. Due to the lack 
of an agreed extent of clinical relevance for an additional effect of a FDC over active comparator, the 
Applicant  has  presented  responder  analysis  data,  which  has  consistently  demonstrated  that  the 
proportion  of  responders  were  greater  in  the  UMEC/VI  arms  as  compared  to  the  monotherapy  arms. 
Taking  all  the  above  into  consideration  and  the  known  difficulties  with  symptomatic  endpoints 
(inconsistent results and not very sensitive to treatment changes), the overall superiority of UMEC/VI 
over monotherapies on the symptomatic endpoint can be considered as satisfactorily demonstrated.  
Similarly  for  the  trough  FEV1  endpoint,  a  statistically  significant  improvement  was  generally 
demonstrated for UMEC/VI over the monocomponents or TIO (except in one study DB 2113374 where 
comparison  against  UMEC  alone  was  not  significant).  For  the  comparison  of  FDC  over  monotherapy, 
there is no generally agreed extent of benefit on trough FEV1 which is considered clinically significant. 
However, based on published literature, for the recently approved LAMA/LABA FDC an improvement in 
trough FEV1 of around 70 - 90  mL was observed. For the UMEC/VI versus VI and UMEC/VI versus TIO 
comparisons, the improvement in trough FEV1 was  generally above 70 mL, whereas for the UMEC/VI 
versus  UMEC  comparison  (contribution  of  VI)  it  was  of  79  mL,  52  mL,  37  mL  and  53  mL  from  four 
different studies. The Applicant presented a justification which showed that this method of determining 
VI  contribution  is  an  under-estimate  of  the  actual  effects.  Furthermore  UMEC/VI  has  shown  clear 
superiority over TIO on this endpoint and UMEC 62.5 appears to have similar effect size as TIO on this 
endpoint. Therefore the contribution of VI to the UMEC/VI FDC based on this endpoint can be accepted 
as clinically relevant. 
Neither  UMEC  nor  VI  are  currently  authorised  as  mono-components.  The  available  data  shows  that 
there  are  no  significant  safety  concerns  with  the  combination  as  compared  to  the  monocomponents 
and the reported adverse events are in line with the safety profile of these classes of molecules (LAMAs 
and  LABAs).  Long-term  safety  data  on  the  FDC  is  currently  limited.  Long-term  safety  is  included  as 
missing information in RMP and will be further characterized as part of the PASS (as described in the 
RMP). 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  CHMP  considers  that  the  available  data  provides  evidence  of  clinically  relevant  effects  of  the 
UMEC/VI FDC in the treatment of COPD without any significant increase in safety concerns. Therefore, 
the overall benefit/risk of Anoro is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
UMEC/VI  has  shown  a  clinically  and  statistically  significant  effect  on  lung  function  (trough  FEV1)  and 
symptomatic endpoint (TDI) as compared to placebo.

The  superiority  of  UMEC/VI  over  the  monocomponents  (UMEC  or  VI)  has  been  demonstrated  to  an 
acceptable  extent,  both  on  lung  function  endpoint  (trough  FEV1)  and  symptomatic  endpoint  (TDI 
score). For the symptomatic endpoint, this is based on a responder analysis. The contribution of UMEC 
(comparison  of  UMEC/VI  versus  VI)  to  the  combination  is  higher  than  the  contribution  of  the  VI 
(comparison of UMEC/VI versus UMEC) on trough FEV1 and TDI score.  
As  compared  to  TIO,  the  standard  COPD  licensed  treatment,  a  clinically  significant  superior  effect  on 
lung function and symptomatic endpoint (TDI or SGRQ) was observed, the latter based on a responder 
analysis.  In  a  recently  concluded  active  control  study  (study  ZEP117115),  a  significant  and  relevant 
effect  of  UMEC/VI  over  current  standard  LAMA  monotherapy  of  TIO  was  more  convincingly 
demonstrated.  
The available safety data on the UMEC/VI FDC does not raise any particular significant safety concerns. 
However  the  overall  long-term  safety  data  is  considered  limited.  Long-term  safety  will  be  further 
characterized as part of the PASS (as described in the RMP). 
Taking  the  overall  evidence  of  benefits  and  risks  discussed  above,  the  benefit-risk  balance  is 
considered to be positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Anoro in the maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve 
symptoms  in  adult  patients  with  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  is  favourable  and 
therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
•  Periodic safety update reports  
The  marketing  authorisation  holder  shall  submit  the  first  periodic  safety  update  report  for  this 
product within six months following authorisation. Subsequently, the marketing authorisation holder 
shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set 
out  in  the  list  of  Union  reference  dates  (EURD  list)  provided  for  under  Article  107c(7)  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions  or  restrictions  with  regard  to  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the 
medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The  MAH  shall  perform  the  required  Pharmacovigilance  activities  and  interventions  detailed  in  the 
agreed  RMP  presented  in  Module  1.8.2  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  and  any  agreed  subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/163509/2014 
Page 306/308 
 
  
  
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (Pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If  the  submission  of  a  PSUR  and  the  update  of  a  RMP  coincide,  they  can  be  submitted  at  the  same 
time. 
•  Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Submission of the final clinical study report on a Post-Authorisation Safety (PAS) 
By Q3 2024 
Observational Cohort Study to Quantify the Incidence and Comparative Safety of 
Selected Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events in COPD Patients with Anoro 
compared with tiotropium (study 201038), according to a protocol agreed by the 
PRAC.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based  on  the  review  of  data,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  active  substance  umeclidinium  bromide  is 
qualified as a new active  substance and acknowledges that the active substance vilanterol trifenatate 
contained in the medicinal product Anoro qualified as a new active substance at time of submission of 
this application. On 13 November 2013 a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union 
for Relvar Ellipta was issued, containing vilanterol as trifenatate.  
The CHMP considered that Anoro is a new combination of two active substances.

Divergent Position 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting 
of a Marketing Authorisation for Anoro for the following indication:  
Anoro  is  indicated  as  a  maintenance  bronchodilator  treatment  to  relieve  symptoms  in  adult  patients 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
The totality of evidence available for this novel fixed dose combination is not conclusive. Consequently 
the benefit-risk is not considered to be favourable at present. 
A  clinically  relevant  effect  on  trough  FEV1  has  not  been  demonstrated  when  the  combination  is 
compared  to  UMEC  alone,  suggesting  that  the  selected  dose  of  VI  may  not  be  appropriate  for  the 
combination.  Therefore,  clinical  relevance  of  adding  vilanterol  to  the  combination  on  pulmonary 
function is not justified. 
Conflicting  results  have  been  obtained  for  symptomatic  endpoints.  Moreover,  there  is  limited  short-
term information  regarding  the impact  of  the  combination  on the  rate of  exacerbations  as  no  specific 
studies have been carried out by the Applicant. 
The overall evidence on long-term safety for the combination is not sufficient, considering that neither 
of the mono-components are currently marketed.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Canakinumab (Ilaris) is a fully human monoclonal anti-human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) antibody of the 
IgG1/κ isotype. Canakinumab binds with high affinity specifically to human IL-1 beta and neutralises the 
biological activity of human IL-1 beta by blocking its interaction with IL-1 receptors, thereby preventing IL-1 
beta-induced gene activation and the production of inflammatory mediators. 
Ilaris has been authorised since 23 October 2009 and is available in two pharmaceutical forms: 150 mg 
powder for solution for injection and 150 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection. The current 
therapeutic indications are Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic 
Arthritis (SJIA), and Gouty Arthritis. 
Ilaris was approved in 11 October 2013 for the treatment of active SJIA in patients aged 2 years and older 
who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
and systemic corticosteroids (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/001109/II/0026).  Ilaris can be given as 
monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. The recommended dose of Ilaris for SJIA patients with 
body weight ≥7.5 kg is 4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 300 mg) administered every four weeks via 
subcutaneous injection. 
The scope of this variation is to amend the approved SJIA indication to include the over-arching medical 
condition, "Still's disease". This includes patients with paediatric onset SJIA and those who experience onset 
of disease in adulthood (and are more commonly ascribed as having adult-onset Still’s disease or AOSD). 
The proposed new indication is: the treatment of active Still’s disease including Adult-Onset Still’s Disease 
(AOSD) and Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) in patients aged 2 years and older who have 
responded inadequately to previous therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
systemic corticosteroids. Ilaris can be given as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. 
AOSD and SJIA are both rare  auto-inflammatory disorders for which there are no definitive diagnostic tests, 
and whose diagnoses is based on defined clinical criteria and age at onset. AOSD occurs worldwide, affecting 
both men and women, with estimated incidence rates of 0.16, 0.22 and 0.4 cases per 100,000 persons in 
France, Japan, and Norway, respectively (Gerfaud-Valentin et al 2014a).The two disorders share many 
features including the clinical signs and symptoms at onset, the serious complications that may arise, the 
involvement of specific cytokines and defects in the function of natural killer (NK) cells profile in the 
underlying pathology, and the clinical response to specific anti-cytokine therapies. AOSD and SJIA both have 
cytokine-driven pathologies, with a central role for interleukin-1 (IL-1). 
No formal studies of the use of canakinumab in the treatment of AOSD were submitted. To support the 
modified indication, the MAH provided a review of the existing scientific literature, demonstration of similar 
biomarker and gene expression profiles in SIJA and AOSD patients, and extrapolation of paediatric 
pharmacokinetics to the adult population to support the dosing recommendation. Furthermore, pooled 
analyses of data from the clinical development program for SJIA was submitted, in which efficacy and safety 
were summarized by the age of the patients, intended to show that the efficacy and safety of canakinumab 
in older adolescents and young adults are consistent with those in younger patients. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of canakinumab and total IL-1β kinetics (free and antibody bound) have been 
characterized in healthy subjects as well as in various patient populations (including CAPS, asthma, psoriasis 
and RA patients) in the original CAPS submission, and subsequently in patients with gouty arthritis and SJIA 
(variations EMEA/H/C/001109/II/10 and EMEA/H/C/001109/ II/26, respectively).  
Canakinumab population PK/PD (pop-PK/PD) model was first submitted and assessed in 2008 in the MAA 
dossier; PD refers here to binding of canakinumab to IL-1β. The model has been slightly updated in 
subsequent variation applications, but the base model and modelling methods have remained the same. The 
pop-PK/PD model was last assessed in variation II/26 (extension of indication - SJIA; CHMP positive opinion 
on 25/07/2013), using pooled data from studies A2203, G2305, G2301 and G2301E1. The dataset included 
201 unique SJIA patients with ages ranging from 2 to < 20 years and body weight ranging from 9.3 to 102.6 
kg. Canakinumab and total IL-1β plasma concentration-time data were adequately described by the 
population-based PK-Binding model 
An overview of the model is provided here; please refer to the EPAR of variation II/26 for a detailed 
description and assessment. 
The mathematical model of the binding of canakinumab (ACZ885) to IL-1β is characterized by the 
equilibrium reaction of the binding of canakinumab to IL-1β which can occur either in the tissue interstitial 
fluid space, where IL-1β is released, or in the plasma. The model also includes diffusion-exchange of 
canakinumab and IL-1β between the peripheral and plasma compartments, plus elimination rates for free 
canakinumab, free IL-1β and the canakinumab-IL-1β complex from the plasma space. It is assumed that the 
elimination of the complex is at the same rate of that for canakinumab due to the small molecular mass of 
IL-1β and hence the lack of steric hindrance for binding of the complex to the FcRn “Brambell” receptor. The 
model describes the measured kinetics of both canakinumab and the observed increase in the biomarker 
total IL-1β in both the plasma and peripheral compartments.  
A schematic diagram of the model is depicted in Figure 1.

Extrapolation of paediatric pharmacokinetic and selected efficacy data to the adult population to 
support the dosing recommendation 
The objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships by age groups to 
support extrapolation of the efficacy of canakinumab in SJIA to the adult population of AOSD patients.

For that purpose, the SJIA pooled dataset used originally during the evaluation of canakinumab in SJIA 
(variation EMEA/H/C/001109/II/26) was updated by including the data from the completion of the cohort 1 
and the cohort 2 from study CACZ885G2301E1. 
The pooled dataset used for the population PK included studies in SJIA as well as various other disease 
populations (e.g., CAPS, Gouty Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Japanese Healthy Volunteer, Non-Japanese 
Healthy Volunteer, and Psoriasis), totaling 28 clinical studies including their extensions. Descriptions of the 
SJIA studies (A2203, G2305, G2301, and G2301E1) are given below. 
CACZ885A2203 was a multicenter, open label, uncontrolled, 2-stage, dose ranging study (0.5 –  9 mg/kg) 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of repeated doses of 
canakinumab given s.c. in paediatric subjects with active SJIA (at least 2 joints with active arthritis [ACR 
definition]; spiking, intermittent fever and CRP > 50mg/L). 23 pediatric patients and young adults (aged 4 
to 20 years) were enrolled in the study with duration up to 30 months. The study consisted of a 15-day 
screening period, a run-in period of maximum 72 hours, a treatment period consisting of two different 
stages (stage 1 and stage 2) during which patients were repeatedly dosed upon relapse with canakinumab 
with a baseline evaluation prior to each drug administration and an observation period following each drug 
administration in order to evaluate the response to treatment and time to relapse. In stage 1, patients were 
treated on an mg/kg basis; an analysis using the PK-Flare model was performed at the end of stage 1 to 
determine the fixed dose(s) to be used in stage 2. Blood samples in stage 1 were collected at baseline (Day 
1) and trough samples were taken pre-dose during treatment period on days 2, 3, 8, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 
99, 113, 127, 141 and 155. Sampling continued every two weeks until the last patient from the highest dose 
cohort had completed two cycles of remission. No samples were taken in stage 2.  
CACZ885G2305 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the short term 
4-week acute efficacy of canakinumab in SJIA patients using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
Pediatric 30 criteria. Patients (≥2 to < 20 years of age) with active SJIA were randomized to receive either 
placebo or canakinumab 4mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) as a single s.c. injection. The primary endpoint was 
response as determined by a minimum adapted ACR30 at Day 15. Blood samples for canakinumab and total 
IL-1β were collected on Day 1, 3, 15 and 29; including cases of flare. 
CACZ885G2301 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, withdrawal study of flare prevention 
by canakinumab in patients with active SJIA. The study consisted of two major parts with two independent 
primary endpoints, Part I was an open-label study period consisting of 4 subparts (Ia to Id). Part Ia 
addressed responder identification, Part Ic steroid tapering. Each part was followed by a 4-week period (Ib 
and Id) to observe the sustainability of response and then ability to maintain response during steroid 
withdrawal. Canakinumab was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Maximum 
duration of Part I was 32 weeks, corresponding to maximum of 8 injections of canakinumab. Part II was a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, withdrawal-design period which aimed to confirm the 
maintenance of the initially observed non-controlled efficacy of canakinumab. The administered drug was 
either canakinumab at 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks or matching placebo injections. The study ended when 37 
independent flare events had occurred(subsequent flares from the same subject in Part II were not included 
in the count as part of the stopping rule). Blood samples were collected at Day 1, 3, 15, 29, 57, end of Part 
Ic (or start of Part Id) visit, every 6 months during Part II, end of Part II visit and in case of flares. 
CACZ885G2301E1 was an open label umbrella extension study designed to demonstrate the long-term 
safety in patients (cohort 1) from previous studies (G2305 and G2301) as well as in canakinumab naïve 
patients (cohort 2). Dosing and safety assessments occurred every 4 weeks, whereas efficacy was assessed 
every 12 weeks. Serum canakinumab and total IL-1β concentrations were collected every 6 months.

Analysis datasets: 
In the updated dataset there were 6125 PK and IL-1ß observations in the SJIA subset, as compared with 
3306 in the previous analysis. 
A separate dataset containing only SJIA pooled studies was created, which contained  additional variables 
including the time records for DAS28, CRP as well as placebo data. It was used to derive post-hoc predicted 
values from the model. 
Baseline demographic variables previously identified to affect the PK properties of canakinumab exposure 
are summarized for SJIA studies in Table 1 and graphical distributions of bodyweight, age and albumin are 
shown in Figure 2.

Canakinumab for treatment of adult onset Still‘s disease to achieve reduction of arthritic 
manifestation (CONSIDER) – (CACZ885GDE01T): Integrated Summary Report: statistical 
analysis and data interpretation of transcript and protein biomarkers in comparison to 
CACZ885G2305 and CACZ885G2301. 
The aim of this study was the comparison of disease-related dysregulation of blood cell transcripts between 
SJIA and AOSD patients to address the question how similar the diseases are on a molecular level, and 
analyse the behaviour of canakinumab responsive genes identified in SJIA in a comparison of AOSD and 
healthy subjects. 
Baseline blood samples for genetic and biomarker analyses were collected from 17 healthy volunteers and 
subjects participating in 3 studies: two from previous studies in SJIA (CACZ885G2305 and CACZ885G2301) 
and a further study in AOSD (CACZ885GDE01T) which was designed to investigate the efficacy of 
canakinumab in patients with AOSD. 
Exploratory biomarker results 
Table 2. Overview of Biomarkers measurements 
Comparison of disease dysregulated genes in AOSD and SJIA 
In order to estimate the level of similarity between SJIA and AOSD, the MAH performed, for each of these 
two diseases, a comparison of baseline (prior to canakinumab treatment) gene expression with that in group 
of healthy controls (paediatric for SJIA and adult for AOSD).  
mRNA was isolated from whole blood samples and analysed using gene arrays. Based on the resulting list of 
robustly expressed genes, the MAH performed a Wilcoxon test (p<0.05, fold change≥1.5) to identify genes 
with differential expression in disease.  
Some common functional themes observed in the list of upregulated genes between the two diseases were 
neutrophil activation and antibacterial functions (CD177, BPI, OLFM4), regulation of IL1-beta synthesis 
(CARD16) and proteolysis (MMP8, CASP5, CARD8, CARD16, SERPING1). 
In order to generate a quantitative estimate of the overlap between transcriptional dysregulation in AOSD 
and SJIA the MAH determined the intersections of up- or down-regulated genes from the AOSD to healthy 
comparison and a previously performed SJIA to age matched healthy control comparison. 
Of 110 probesets with at least 3-fold upregulation in AOSD, 72 (66%) were at least 1.5-fold upregulated in 
SJIA and 35 (32%) were at least 3-fold upregulated in SJIA. This analysis did not show a 100% concordance, 
as 38 probesets showed a < 1.5-fold difference, or did not reach statistical significance.

Supervised analysis of published SJIA-related gene signatures in PBMCs of AOSD patients and healthy 
subjects 
As no internal data on the gene expression in PBMCs of SJIA patients was available, a supervised 
visualisation of published gene lists in the AOSD-healthy comparison of PBMC gene expression was 
performed. For this purpose selected publications which included comparisons between healthy and SJIA 
patients were chosen, using PBMC samples and microarry technology to increase the comparability between 
the internal and external datasets. 
The results for the probesets (Probe IDs, Affymetrix IDs) from Fall et al 2007 are shown in Table 3.  
Table 3. Gene expression profiling for macrophage activation syndrome in SJIA-innate immune gene cluster 
For 16 of these 20 probesets (80%), a differential expression between peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PMBCs) of AOSD patients and healthy subjects with p-values below 0.05 was observed. All of these were 
regulated in the same direction as described for SJIA.  
Supervised analysis of a SJIA canakinumab response signature in AOSD patients at baseline and in healthy 
subjects 
The overlap of SJIA canakinumab responsive genes with AOSD dys-regulated genes was actually slightly 
larger than the overlap with SJIA dys-regulated genes: 480 of 577 (83%) genes down-regulated by 
canakinumab in SJIA were also up-regulated in AOSD, relative to healthy while 443 of these 577 genes 
(77%) were also up-regulated in SJIA (Figure 5).

(AOSD or SJIA) 
Similarly, 450 of 728 (62%) %) genes up-regulated by canakinumab in SJIA were also down-regulated in 
AOSD, relative to healthy while 353 of these 728 genes (49%) were also down-regulated in SJIA (Figure 6).

Protein markers in AOSD 
Plasma levels of two central pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-18 were assessed for baseline samples 
of AOSD patients and compared to previously obtained values in healthy controls and other inflammatory 
conditions (Table 4).

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The previously developed PK-binding-model for canakinumab was used to generate individual predicted 
canakinumab and IL-1β-concentrations for patients who were not included in the previous submission. 
This was done by fixing model parameters at their final estimated values (Table 5, initially included in 
EMEA/H/C/1109/II/0026 submission for SJIA) and updating post-hoc predictions without running the fitting 
algorithm.

Steady-state exposure metrics were also derived (CMINss, CMAXss, AUCss). Figures 10 and 11 show 
canakinumab exposure in SJIA patients of various age and weight categories, using different simulated 
metrics of exposure at steady state (CMINss, CMAXss, AUCss). Positive trends in median exposure were 
seen with increasing age or weight, but distributions overlap significantly and can be considered comparable 
overall, consistent with previous observations in the SJIA population.

In addition, PK exposure metrics from SJIA patients were compared with those from a simulated population 
of “SJIA-like”adult patients. For this purpose, demographic data (age, weight) from all CAPS and Gout 
patients above 20 years of age (n=913 patients) were selected from the pooled dataset; their median age 
was 51 years (range 20-91) and median weight was 91 kg (range 19-171). Steady-state metrics (CMINss, 
CMAXss, AUCss) were simulated for approximately 10000 patients using these demographic data and 
assuming all received the dosing regimen recommended in SJIA. The results from these simulations are 
illustrated in Figure 12. In this figure, for each PK metric the same boxplots from Figure 10, representing 
the SJIA clinical study population, are presented alongside an additional boxplot for the simulated population 
of “SJIA-like” adults (age ≥ 20).

IL-1-beta levels in AOSD, in response to anti-IL-1 treatment and comparison to the data 
available in SJIA 
Higher levels of IL-1beta have been observed in 2 out of 4 AOSD patients compared with controls, as 
reported by Kötter et al 2007, Table 6.  
Table 6. Laboratory data before and after Anakinra treatment, Kötter et al 2007 
In another publication (Fitzgerald et al. 2005) it has been demonstrated that patients with refractory AOSD 
exhibit higher IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1RA, IL-6, and IL-18 serum levels prior to the first injection of an 
anti-IL-1 treatment. Regarding serum IL-1beta kinetics in other auto-inflammatory disorders successfully 
treated with IL-1 blockade treatments, the authors concluded that circulating levels of IL-1β represent a “
spillover” effect from the respective cytokine levels at the end organ. Therefore, attribution of a causative 
role for IL-1β in disease should not be solely based on circulating levels but rather on clinical responses to 
agents that reduce IL-1 activities.

Enhanced responses to anti IL-1 treatments in AOSD patients with active disease has been reported across 
single case reports, smaller or larger patient series, clinical trials, national surveys.  
From one meta-analysis including data from 134 patients, drawn from the above described studies, surveys 
and case reports (Hong et al. 2014) it was demonstrated that IL-1 inhibition is effective not just in inducing 
remission but also in allowing steroid dose reduction in AOSD patients, while being well-tolerated and not 
increasing the risks of adverse events. 
Lequerré et al. (2008), a study in 15 patients treated with IL-1 blockade, suggested that IL-1 inhibition 
might be more effective in AOSD patients whose systemic symptoms predominate over the chronic arthritic 
symptoms. However, in another report (Kontzias and Efthimiou 2012), AOSD patients with severe systemic 
and articular manifestations and poor response to short acting anti IL-1 compounds were successfully 
treated with canakinumab postulating that complete remission in AOSD, in terms of both systemic and 
articular manifestations, may be dependent on a more sustained IL-1 suppression with a long-acting IL-1 
inhibitor. 
Patients from the phase 2, phase 3 and extension studies (CACZ885A2203; CACZ885G2305; 
CACZ885G2301; CACZ885G2301E), in which the observed IL-1β levels were above the lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ; 0.5 pg/mL) at baseline were measured across age groups (Figure 13, panel A). Panel 
B in the same Figure shows the proportion of values per age-year that were above LLOQ.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Kinetics of canakinumab and IL-1β in SJIA patients < 20 years of age were described by a population-PK/PD 
model, which was previously assessed in variation II/26. The CHMP concluded at the time that canakinumab 
and total IL-1β plasma concentration-time data were adequately described by the population-based 
PK-Binding model. The data analysed at the time have been supplemented with PK data from additional SJIA 
patients; these data were used for external validation of the population PK model and supported the 
conclusion that the model can acceptably predict exposures in a new dataset.  
In the updated SJIA data set, distributions of age (1-19y), weight (9.2 – 102.6 kg) covered wide ranges. Age 
distribution was quite homogenous around the mean (8.7y). Regarding weight, the majority had a body 
Assessment report  
EMA/493970/2016 
Page 22/57 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
weight between 10-30 kg which is lower than the population mean (32.8 kg). Only a few subjects > 70 kg 
were included. Around 40 subjects (12.3 %) in the age range of 15-20 years contributed data for the 
population PK analysis. 
A positive trend in median exposure (AUC, Cmax, Cmin,ss) was seen with increasing age or weight (up to 75 
kg) which is consistent with the observation of a slight decrease in body-weight-normalized Clearance with 
increasing age in the previous SJIA population PK modeling analysis. 
The approved dosage of canakinumab in SJIA is 4 mg/kg (up to 300 mg for patients ≥75 kg) every 4 weeks. 
Overall the pharmacokinetics of canakinumab in young adult SJIA patients aged 16 to 20 years were similar 
to those in patients less than 16 years of age. Predicted canakinumab steady state exposures at a dose level 
of 4 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) in patients over the age of 20 years were comparable to those in SJIA 
patients younger than 20 years of age.  
Likewise, typical exposure tended to increase with body weight up to 75 kg and level or slightly decrease in 
subjects from 75 to 102 kg. Prior data indicate that canakinumab pharmacokinetics is similar across different 
disease populations when comparing their bodyweight normalized clearance. 
Steady-state metrics (CMINss, CMAXss, AUCss) were simulated for approximately 10,000 patients using the 
demographic data from all CAPS and Gout patients above 20 years of age (n=913 patients) and assuming all 
received the dosing regimen recommended in SJIA. Predicted exposure in “SJIA-like” adult patients was 
nearly identical to that observed in young adult SJIA patients. 
Plots of observed versus (population and individual) predicted values, and residuals versus population 
predicted values and time showed that that the previous model could adequately and without bias describe 
the totality of canakinumab concentration data in study CACZ885G2301E1.  
The model was also able to predict IL-1ß concentrations with little bias up to approximately two years after 
starting canakinumab therapy, (but showed trends of over-prediction for longer-term IL-1ß data). However, 
this was not deemed of particular concern by the CHMP as for the present graphical exploration as focus was 
on the first 12 weeks of treatment and only canakinumab concentrations were used. 
According to the prediction for “adult SJIA patients”, a higher variability in exposure may be expected in 
adults weighing in excess of 75 kg. The CHMP recommended that the MAH provides further data which 
expected in this regard through PK samples which will be collected and analyzed in the ongoing clinical trial 
of the use of canakinumab in the treatment of AOSD (study CACZ885GDE01T). 
Pharmacodynamics 
The comparison of disease dysregulated genes in AOSD and SJIA did not show a 100% concordance as 38 
probesets showed a < 1.5-fold difference, or did not reach statistical significance. However, this could be 
explained by the inherent small technical variation in sampling, mRNA preparation, and chip performance, 
but also by biological variation. The latter might be attributed, e.g., to the age difference in the SJIA and 
AOSD study population or to inter-subject variability. However, the overall alteration of the blood transcript 
profile in both patient populations is highly similar, indicating a strong concordance between SJIA and AOSD 
at the molecular/cellular level. 
The analysis of a SJIA canakinumab response signature in AOSD patients at baseline and in healthy subjects 
indicated that the vast majority of transcripts which show an immediate response (day 3) to canakinumab in 
SJIA are amongst the dysregulated genes in AOSD patients, suggesting a concordance in IL-1β dependent 
pathology.  
Published data have also demonstrated that anti-IL-1 treatment is able to normalize or improve markers of 
systemic inflammation, and normalize levels of key circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 1β 
and its downstream cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-18, and IL-6.The applicant provided data in order to 
demonstrate similar genetic profiles and similar clinical responses to anti-IL-1 agents in AOSD patients 
compared to SJIA patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/493970/2016 
Page 23/57 
 
  
  
Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-18 were found in baseline samples of AOSD 
patients which are comparable to previously observed elevated levels of these proteins in SJIA patients. The 
levels were elevated in SJIA and AOSD in comparison to healthy volunteers and patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis. The levels also appeared higher in comparison to the NOMID- or MWS-phenotypes of CAPS. The 
mean levels of IL-6 protein were found to be approximately 26-fold elevated in AOSD patients while mean 
IL-18 levels were even 120-fold higher than in healthy subjects. These findings are again consistent with 
previous observations of strongly elevated levels of these proteins in SJIA patients. In contrast, elevation of 
these pro-inflammatory proteins – in particular IL-18 - is much less pronounced in patients with other 
auto-inflammatory conditions like NOMID/CAPS or Muckle-Wells. 
The data submitted overall indicate that both SJIA and AOSD have cytokine-driven pathologies, with a 
central role for IL-1. 
Extrapolation of efficacy data from SJIA to AOSD 
Observed response (DAS28 scores and CRP levels) to canakinumab was similar in all three age groups in 
SJIA patients <20 years of age. Likewise, exposure-response relationships were similar for all the age 
groups. It is reasonable to assume that the efficacy in the age group 16 to 20 years of age is comparable to 
the efficacy in subjects > 20 years of age. As SJIA and AOSD share same pathogenetic mechanisms, it is 
reasonable to assume that the exposure-response relationship can be extrapolated to the AOSD population. 
Individual DAS28 scores at week 8 and 12 also indicated a consistent concentration-response relationship 
for all three age groups.  
Concentration-response relationships were also comparable with respect to CRP change from baseline and 
based on the available data it is reasonable to expect similar exposure-response relationships in AOSD 
patients. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the population PK analyses using all available data from SJIA patients support extrapolation of 
canakinumab PK from pediatric (SJIA) to adult (AOSD) patients. It can be expected that both populations 
would be exposed to a similar range of canakinumab exposures with the currently recommended dosing 
regimen for SJIA.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
A pooled analyses of data from the clinical development program for SJIA was conducted in order to show 
that the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in older ‘adult’ SJIA patients (≥16 years) are consistent with 
those in younger patients. 
2.4.1.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy data up to 12 weeks of exposure from the SJIA studies G2305, G2301 (excluding patients from the 
study A2203 who rolled over into G2301), and G2301E1 were submitted in support of this application the 
analysis; only data from canakinumab-treated patients were included  (Full analysis set); data from patients 
who received placebo in study G2305 were excluded.  
A brief outline of the design of these studies is included in Section 2.3.2 of this report.  
Definition of subgroups for efficacy analysis 
The following age subgroup categories were defined: 
Assessment report  
EMA/493970/2016 
Page 24/57 
 
  
  
 
•  Childhood SJIA: 2 - <12 years old 
•  Adolescent SJIA: 12 - <16 years old 
•  Adults: ≥16 years old 
Patients were divided in age subgroups at the time of their enrolment into the study. 
The demographic and disease characteristics at baseline are shown in Table 7.

Efficacy variables 
Adapted American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric 30/50/70/90/100 response 
Responses were defined as improvement from baseline of at least 30%/50%/70%/90%/ 100% in at least 3 
of the response variables 1 to 6 (see below) and no intermittent fever, i.e. body temperature ≤ 38°C, in the 
preceding week (variable 7), with no more than one variable of 1-6 worsening by more than 30%. 
Adapted ACR Pediatric 30, 50, 70, 90, 100 response variables (ACR components): 
1. Physician’s Global Assessment of disease activity on a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 mm = 
no disease activity to 100 mm = very severe disease activity. 
2. Parent’s or patient’s (if appropriate by age) Global Assessment of patient’s overall wellbeing on a 100 mm 
VAS from 0 mm = very well to 0-100 mm = very poor. 
3. Functional ability: Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) 
4. Number of joints with active arthritis using the ACR definition (The ACR definition of active arthritis is any 
joint with swelling, or in the absence of swelling, limitation of motion accompanied by either pain on motion 
or tenderness not due to deformity) 
5. Number of joints with limitation of motion 
6. Laboratory measure of inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP; standardized mg/L) 
7. Absence of intermittent fever due to SJIA (body temperature ≤ 38°C only for several hours during the 
day) during the preceding week ACR 30 responder: response according to the adapted ACR Pediatric 30 
criteria (yes/no), and similarly, for ACR 50, ACR 70, ACR 90 and ACR 100. 
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) ACR 30/50/70/90/100 response 
Improvement from baseline of at least 30%/50%/70%/90%/100% in at least 3 of the response variables 1 
to 6 (see above) with no more than one of the ACR core components (variables 1- 6) worsening by more 
than 30%. An ACR response is derived if the underlying criteria are fully conclusive for the overall measure 
and set to missing otherwise, as outlined in Table 8. 
Table 8. Calculation of ACR 30/50/70/90/100 criteria 
Assessment report  
EMA/493970/2016

If one of the response variables 1 to 6 (Physician’s Global Assessment, Parents or patient’s Global 
Assessment, numbers of active joints, number of joints with limitation of motion, CRP, CHAQ) is 0 at baseline 
and greater than 0 at a later visit then worsening is taken as 100%. 
C-reactive protein normalization 
CRP levels were measured at local laboratories and CRP values were therefore standardized to a normal 
range of 0-10 mg/L. CRP (standardized in mg/L) was categorized as ‘Normal’ if the value was <10 mg/L and 
as ‘Elevated’ otherwise. Due to some issues with standardization, some values could be negative. These 
were set to missing. 
Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, CHAQ 
•  CHAQ was used to assess physical ability and functional status of patients as well as quality of life. The 
disability dimension consists of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing eight 
common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal 
hygiene, gripping and activities. Patients choose from four response categories, ranging from ‘without 
any difficulty’ (score 0) to ‘unable to do’ (score 3). 
•  Within each of the 8 categories, only the item indicating the most severe impairment contributed to the 
category score. 
•  If the patient required the use of aids, devices, or help from another to accomplish any of the activities in 
an associated category, then the score for that category was assigned the value 2, unless the score was 
already 3 (i.e. the scores of 0 or 1 were increased to 2). 
•  From the scores for each category, a Standard Disability Index (SDI) was computed by summing the 
computed scores for each category and dividing by the number of categories answered. 
•  The SDI was not computed if the patient did not have the scores for at least 6 categories. This SDI is the 
CHAQ score, which was used in the statistical analyses of this instrument. The range for this score is (0, 
3). 
•  The 'Other' option was excluded in the calculation of the CHAQ score. 
Other endpoints 
Inactive disease was defined as no joints with active arthritis; no fever (body temperature ≤38°C), no 
rheumatoid rash, serositis, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or generalized lymphadenopathy attributable to 
JIA; normal ESR or CRP; a Physician’s Global Assessment of disease activity indicating no disease activity 
(i.e. best possible score ≤10 mm).

DAS-28 (CRP) scores by age group showed similar changes in at Day 15 (median changes from baseline 
were -2.10 in the 2 to <12 years age group, -2.53 in the 12 to <16 years age group, and -2.37 in the adult 
subgroup). Median changes from baseline at Day 85 were also similar between the 12 to <16 years and adult 
age groups (-3.76 and - 3.50, respectively), but smaller in the 2 to <12 years age group (-2.64).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In this pooled analysis submitted data from 301 patients were included. Of these, 29 patients were >16 at 
the time point of enrolment. This age group is in the main focus for the assessment of possible extrapolation 
from child data to adult efficacy and safety. 
The baseline demographics and disease criteria did not differ in the three evaluated age cohorts; especially 
the severity of disease at baseline was very balanced between younger patients and the oldest cohort. 
No significant trend with age was seen in baseline values of IL-1β, C-reactive protein (CRP) and Disease 
Activity Score (DAS28) in SJIA patients. 
The MAH presented a comparison of efficacy results in the three age groups (2->12 n=216, 12->16 n=56, 
> 16n=29) for the ACR pediatric response, number of active joints, number of joints with limitation of 
motion, CRP levels , Physician’s global assessment of disease activity, and CHAQ disability score. 
No major differences were observed in these clinically relevant efficacy endpoints between younger age 
groups and older age groups. A trend could of a slightly better response on treatment in the older age group 
>16.  
Adapted ACR pediatric 30 response at Day 15 was achieved by 158/216 (73.1%) of subjects in the 2 - <12 
years old group, 47/56 (83.9%) of subjects in the 12 - <16 years old group, and 25/29 (86.2%) of subjects 
in the ≥16 years old group. The corresponding JIA ACR 30 responses at Day 15 were 78.2%, 83.9% and 
86.2%, respectively. The treatment was highly effective and the onset of response was rapid in all age 
groups, as ACR70 (both adopted ACR pediatric and JIA ACR) responses were reached by over half of the 
patients by Day 15.  
The efficacy was well maintained in all age groups up to Day 85, with adapted ACR 30 responses of 67.7%, 
74.1% and 83.3% in the age groups of 2 - <12 years, 12 - <16 years and ≥16 years, respectively. The 
adapted ACR 100 pediatric responses were highest at Day 57 (31.5%, 33.9% and 34.5% in the age groups, 
respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/493970/2016 
Page 29/57 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Changes from baseline in the seven ACR components were consistently similar or slightly greater in the ≥
16 years age group. Median CRP values were less than 10 mg/L, i.e., normal by Day 15 in the eldest age 
group, and within the normal range in all age groups by Day 57. Overall, similar or better responses were 
seen in the two older age groups compared to the youngest patients <12 years of age. 
All 3 age groups also showed similar changes in DAS-28 (CRP) at Day 15 (median changes from baseline 
were -2.10 in the 2 - <12 years age group, -2.53 in the 12 - <16 years age group, and -2.37 in the ≥16 years 
age group). Median changes from baseline at Day 85 were also similar between the 12 - <16 years and ≥16 
years age groups (-3.76 and - 3.50, respectively), but smaller in the 2 - <12 years age group (-2.64). 
Treatment effect was sustained over the prolonged assessment period until day 85 also in each of the three 
age groups. 
These results are supportive for the proposed change of indication to allow treatment in adults newly 
diagnosed with AOSD. However, as the subset of young adult SJIA patients aged 16 to 20 years which closer 
resmbles AOSD patients, the CHMP recommended  that the MAH ensures that the results of a multicentre, 
placebo-controlled, 12-week, investigator-intiated trial of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
canakinumab in 68 AOSD patients is ongoing (ACZ885GDE01T/ NCT02204293) are submitted to the CHMP 
as soon as these are available.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the pooled analysis of 12 weeks efficacy data divided in three age groups are supportive for 
the proposed change of indication for the treatment  of adults newly diagnosed with AOSD.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
For this submission, analyses previously conducted for the SJIA submission were re-run using appropriate 
age cut-offs, in order to show whether safety are similar between children, adolescents and adults. The 
safety pooling datasets previously used for the SJIA submission were updated with data from study 
G2301E1. 
For the previous SJIA submission, data from studies A2203, G2305 (canakinumab group only), G2301, and 
G2301E1 Cohort 1 (data up to 31-May-2012) were pooled to create one pooled database for safety. For the 
current analysis, complete data from G2301E1 were added, meaning complete data from Cohort 1 (roll-over 
patients from G2301 and G2305) and Cohort 2 (canakinumab-naïve patients at the start of the study). 
Age subgroup categories were defined as follows: 
•  Childhood: 2-<12 years old 
•  Adolescent: 12-<16 years old 
•  Adult: ≥16 years old 
Patient exposure 
The difference between the SJIA pooled safety population (‘Safety Set, Table 11) and the pooled efficacy 
population is the addition of Study A2203 containing a total of 23 patients. This dose-finding study had a 
differing dose regimen compared to the other three included studies, dosing upon relapse rather than at 
Assessment report

prescribed regular intervals. The Safety set also contained non-canakinumab naïve patients unlike the FAS.  
Disease features were comparable among age groups, except for the expected shorter duration of disease in 
children. 
Table 11. Overall duration of exposure, pooled SJIA population (Safety set) 
Table 12 shows the numbers of canakinumab doses in each age group.  
Table 12. Number of doses of canakinumab (Safety Set) 
Median exposure in the SJIA patients was lower (542 days) in the 12 to <16 years age group than in the 2 
to <12 years age group (728 days) and the ≥ 16 years age group (757 days).

Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Changes from baseline in absolute neutrophil count, direct platelet count, hemoglobin and white blood cell 
count were summarized by age group (data not shown). The changes observed were consistent with the 
known safety profile and mechanism of action of canakinumab. There were no clinically meaningful 
differences in changes from baseline across age groups.  
Clinical chemistry 
Changes from baseline in aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), creatinine clearance, 
total bilirubin, total cholesterol and triglycerides in the SJIA population were summarized (data not shown). 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in changes from baseline across age groups.

Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks 
The Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks defined in the canakinumab Risk Management 
Plan (RMP) were also assessed by age group. Among the important identified risks, the proportions of 
patients with infection AEs were similar across all three age groups. On the basis of the data available, 
patients aged ≥16 years do not appear to be at higher risk of opportunistic infections than younger patients. 
There were no patients with AEs corresponding to the identified risk “Neutropenia” in the ≥16 years age 
group. Events corresponding to the identified risk “Thrombocytopenia” appeared to be slightly less common 
in the ≥16 years age group, (9.7%) than in the 2 - <12 years age group (17.6%), although the proportion 
of patients with such events in the 12 - <16 years age group was lower (5.0%). The proportion of patients 
with at least 1 event corresponding to the identified risk “Leukopenia” appeared to be lower in the ≥16 years 
age group. There were no patients in the ≥16 years age group with events corresponding to the identified 
risk “Long-term effect on kidney function”. Adverse events corresponding to the identified risk 
“Musculoskeletal pain and arthralgia”, i.e. in the SOC “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” were 
reported in similar proportions of patients (51 to 55%) in each age group. 
Among the important potential risks, the proportions of patients with AEs corresponding to the potential risk 
“Immunogenicity/allergenicity” were similar in all age groups, namely 24/233 (10.3%) in the 2 - <12 years 
age group, 10/60 (16.7%) in the 12 - <16 years age group, and 3/31 (9.7%) in the ≥16 years age group. 
No events corresponding to the potential risk “Autoimmunity reactions” were identified for any age group. 
There were 2 malignancies, both in the 2 - <12 age group. The ≥16 years age group appeared to have a 
higher rate than the other age groups of AEs identified by a broad initial screen as corresponding to the 
potential risk “Drug induced liver injury (DILI, hepatic transaminases and bilirubin elevations)”, with 9/31 
(29.0%) of patients having at least 1 such AE, compared with 35/233 (15.0%) of the 2 - <12 years age 
group and 10/60 (16.7%) of the 12 - <16 years age group. The difference appeared to be largely due to 
higher rates of laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs in the ≥16 years age group. The differences are 
probably exaggerated by the small sample size of the ≥16 years age group, with ALT increased and bilirubin 
increased reported for 3 and 2 patients, respectively. None of the patients with these AEs in the ≥16 years 
age group had severe events.

EMA/493970/2016

The proportion of patients with events corresponding to the potential risk “Disorders of lipoprotein 
metabolism” appeared to be higher in the ≥16 years age group 2/31 (6.5%) than in the younger age groups. 
For the potential risk “Vertigo/dizziness”, the ≥16 years age group had a higher total rate of events (4/31, 
12.9%) than the younger age groups, i.e. 3.4% in the 2 - <12 years age group and 5.0% in the 12 - <16 
years age group). Of note, the SmPC already contains advice regarding driving and use of machinery in 
affected patients. There were no reports of events corresponding to the potential risk of 
“Canakinumab-immunosuppressants combination therapy toxicity” in any age group. Macrophage 
activation syndrome, identified by the MedDRA preferred term histiocytosis haematophagic, was reported in 
13/233 (5.6%) of the 2 - <12 years age group, 7/60 (11.7%) of the 12 - <16 years age group and 3/31 
(9.7%) of the ≥16 years age group; corresponding exposure-adjusted rates were 2.9, 6.7 and 6.6 events 
per 100 patient-years. No AEs corresponding to the potential risk of “Pulmonary complications: pulmonary 
hypertension and interstitial lung disease” were reported in patients aged ≥16 years. 
Integrated immunogenicity report for patients with SJIA treated with canakinumab  
This integrated immunogenicity report (IIR) summarizes data from the canakinumab SJIA development 
program, from clinical trials completed prior to 30 June 2015. 
The IIR also describes the methodology and results of a revised assay to detect anti-canakinumab 
antibodies, which was used for samples from Study ACZ885G2301E1 (including re-testing of samples tested 
using the previous assay). 
The strategy used to detect immunogenicity takes into consideration not only the results of ADA assays, but 
also other potential effects of immunogenicity, including effects on drug exposure/pharmacokinetics 
(changes in drug clearance); pharmacodynamic effects (changes in drug target binding); efficacy (impaired 
response to treatment); and some adverse events. 
Methods and analysis 
In 2010, the MAH developed a new assay for anti-canakinumab ADA detection with higher sensitivity, i.e. a 
bridging MSD assay. This bridging MSD assay was further improved by adding an acidic dissociation step to 
reach a better drug tolerance and used for clinical sample analysis from 2014.

Observations of post-treatment ADAs were classified in three categories: transient, persistent or other: 
• 
• 
Transient: single ADA positive time-point(s) followed by ADA negative time-point(s) 
Persistent: two or more consecutive ADA positive time-points for an interval that spans >16 weeks 
•  Other: Patients with only one sample collected; patients with at least 2 samples collected at an interval 
<16 weeks due to study design; and other patients that do not fit into the definitions above of transient 
and persistent.  
Results 
The SJIA clinical program included a total of 324 canakinumab treated patients, with 281 patients receiving 
more than 1 dose of canakinumab. A total of 319 patients in the SJIA clinical program contributed to 
immunogenicity testing, and a total of 16 patients had ADA detected, per the assay used in each study. Out 
of these 16 patients, 11 patients had ADA detected at baseline only and thus are not considered as 
treatment-induced, while 5 had post-treatment ADA with no baseline ADA detected, representing an 
incidence of 1.6% (5/319) of positive ADA in canakinumab-treated SJIA patients (see Table 20). 
Table 20. Summary overview of ADA incidence in SJIA program 
Of the post-treatment ADA patients, all were classified as having transient antibodies, as they occurred at 
single visits in all cases (Table 21). No neutralizing antibodies were detected in any of the SJIA patients. 
Since no events of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions were reported, IgE testing was not performed in 
any of the SJIA studies. 
There were no obvious safety or efficacy clinical consequences for the patients who had ADA detected 
(Table 21). 
In the 5 subjects who had post-treatment anti-drug antibody detected, the impact of ADA formation on the 
pharmacokinetics of canakinumab and IL-1β-canakinumab binding, as measured by total IL-1β, was 
examined. At the times when antibodies were detected, the observed trough canakinumab concentrations 
were comparable to other trough concentrations when there were no positive ADAs detected. This suggests 
no apparent impact of ADA formation on canakinumab pharmacokinetics. There was also no apparent impact 
of ADA formation on total IL-1β concentrations.

A total of 35 patients met the definition of loss of efficacy because they 1) showed initial response (≥adapted 
pediatric ACR30) on Day 15 in the study where they received their first dose of canakinumab; and 2) 
subsequently discontinued the program due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect after becoming a 
non-responder at least 1 time point. These patients were assessed separately for ADA as well as indirect 
evidence of antibody production post-treatment. 
Of the 35 patients with loss of efficacy, 32 had no ADA detected at any time, and 2 had ADA detected at 
baseline only. One patient had post-treatment ADA detected, at a single visit with 2 subsequent negative 
ADA assessments (including at the time of discontinuation); this patient discontinued due to unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect over 300 days after the visit with positive ADA.  AEs potentially related to 
immunogenicity/allergenicity: A total of 37 patients (24 aged 2 - <12 years, 10 aged 12 - <16 years, and 3 
aged ≥16 years) and 51 AEs were retrieved using the search criteria. No anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid 
reaction AEs were reported. Three of the 37 patients experienced serious adverse events. SAEs in two of 
these patients (toxic skin eruption; and severe rash) were not considered as potentially related to 
immunogenicity/allergenicity due to canakinumab, as they had more plausible alternative explanations; 
immunogenicity/allergenicity could not be excluded as a possible cause in the third patient (urticaria and 
pyrexia), even though the SAE did not occur within 24 hours of a canakinumab dose. 
Of the 37 patients with an AE potentially related to immunogenicity reported, 9 experienced a total of 10 AEs 
that qualified as immunogenicity-related (as previously defined). None of these 10 events were serious, and 
none led to study discontinuation. All 10 of the AEs were reported as mild. Of the 10 events, 7 resolved in 
between 1 and 51 days (resolution date not provided in 3 events). No action was taken in 2 events and 8 
required concomitant medications. Of note, one patient experienced mild eyelid oedema and ADA were 
detected 83 days later. No ADA were detected at any time point in any other patient with potential 
allergenicity/immunogenicity AEs. 
Post marketing experience 
As reported in [PSUR 12] (cut-off date 30 Jun 2015) the estimated cumulative exposure from marketing 
experience was approximately 7000 patient treatment years (PTY) to cut off date 30 Jun 2015. Data are 
available from approximately 10,000 patients who are estimated to have been treated with canakinumab. 
No new or changing safety signals have been identified in the reporting interval of this PSUR (PSUR 12; 01 
Jan 2015 to 30 Jun 2015). The safety data remain in accord with the previous cumulative experience.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety pooling dataset includes complete data from study G2301E1, including Cohort 1 with roll-over 
patients from G2301 and G2305 and cohort 2 with canakinumab-naïve patients. Similar to the efficacy 
analysis, analysis of safety has been performed in the age categories of children (2 - <12 years old), 
adolescents (12 - <16 years old) and adults (≥16 years old). 
The pooled safety set consists of 324 patients. Exposure was greater in the younger age groups which is 
comprehensible. Patient number in the oldest age group is limited to 31 participants. 
The important identified risks of canakinumab in the treatment of SJIA are infections, opportunistic 
infections, neutropenia, drug induced liver injury, decreased estimated creatinine clearance and proteinuria, 
and musculoskeletal pain and arthralgia. 
The most frequent adverse events reported were in all three age groups infections and infestations, 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. There was some variation 
between age groups in exposure-adjusted total rates of AEs across the SOCs, but no clear pattern could be 
distinguished caused also by the rather low patient number. 
Some differences in frequency between age groups can be seen but overall the safety profile in older 
patients compared to younger age groups is balanced. 
The exposure adjusted incidence rate of adverse events allows a better overview of the safety profile in the 
three age groups. The overall rate of AEs is the lowest in the oldest population. Differences in some of the 
preferred terms can be seen, which is often a result of the disease incidence in the age groups. 
In the SJIA population, one patient died in Study G2301 due to pulmonary hypertension that was associated 
with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). In addition, one patient from Cohort 1 of Study G2301E1 died 
approximately 3 months after discontinuation from the study.  
In the first described death, a relationship to canakinumab treatment cannot be ruled out totally. The second 
death in a 10 year old female, non-responder to canakinumab, occurred 3 month after discontinuation of 
study drug and is regarded as not related.  
SAEs were reported less frequently in the ≥16 years age group (9 patients; 29%, vs. 34.8% in the 2 - <12 
years age group and 41.7% in the 12 - <16 years age group).  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was 
reported in 2 patients in this group vs. none in the younger patients. CMV infection is an identified risk 
(opportunistic infection). Cases of another identified risk, MAS (Histiocytosis haematophagic), were reported 
in all age groups, with slightly higher frequency in the older age groups (9.7-11.7%, vs. 5.2% in the   2 - <12 
years age group). 
The exposure adjusted incidence rates of serious adverse events suggest that the rate of AEs and SAEs is 
decreasing in the oldest age group, with the exception of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. 
Otherwise, incidence rates of SAEs are rather balanced in the three age groups. Exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and MAS tended to be higher in older age groups. These SAEs, 
along with cytomegalovirus infection, were the only SAEs that were more frequent in the ≥ 16 year age 
group. Serious adverse events, and in particular serious infections, were less frequent in patients aged ≥ 16 
years. 
Assessment of laboratory findings did not show any clinically relevant differences in changes from baseline 
across the three age groups. 
Within the ≥16 years age group, the Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks were generally 
reported in similar or smaller numbers compared to the younger age groups, except for AEs corresponding 
to the potential risks of “Drug induced liver injury”, “Disorders of lipoprotein metabolism” and 
Assessment report  
EMA/493970/2016 
Page 43/57 
 
  
  
“Vertigo/dizziness”. Among laboratory findings (see above), the ≥16 years age group tended to show less 
increase in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and more increase in bilirubin levels. None of the events were 
severe and there may also be some uncertainty due to the relatively small number of subjects in the highest 
age group. Regarding dizziness/vertigo, the SmPC section 4.7 already contains information regarding this 
AE and the corresponding advice regarding ability to drive and use machines.  
The 2015 integrated immunogenicity report for SJIA is an update of the previous report from 2012. The 
updated report includes final data from Study ACZ885G2301E1 and overall data from 324 patients, of whom 
319 provided immunogenicity data. 
Immunogenicity data were not divided into the age groups due to the low numbers of detected ADA. Overall, 
16 of the 319 patients contributing to immunogenicity testing in the SJIA clinical program had 
anti-canakinumab antibodies. Among the 16 patients, 11 patients had baseline positive ADA and 5 patients 
(1.6%) had post-treatment ADA. The post-treatment ADAs occurred at a single occasion and the titers were 
low. There were no apparent efficacy or safety related clinical consequences. No effect of antibody 
development on clinical efficacy was detected. No change in the immunogenicity profile of canakinumab is 
apparent. No SmPC update regarding immunogenicity has been proposed by the MAH and this is acceptable. 
The proportions of patients who discontinued due to AEs were higher in the older age groups. The most 
common AEs leading to discontinuation in all age groups were juvenile idiopathic arthritis , which is probably 
related to the background indication of the patients and MAS. These were both most common in the ≥16 
year age group and were the only AEs that led to discontinuation in this age group. 
MAS is an AE of great concern Still’s disease and is monitored intensively through the Macrophage Activation 
Syndrome Adjudication Committee (MASCAC) which independently reviews evaluate pre-specified AEs or 
laboratory values that could potentially indicate MAS, and then adjudicates all cases identified through a 
search of the SJIA clinical program and the global safety databases.  In the future, cases in AOSD patients 
will also be monitored in this way. However, so far, no signal for a higher incidence of MAS with canakinumab 
treatment has been seen. 
Furthermore, considering that the new indication is likely to increase the use of canakinumab in women of 
child bearing potential it was considered appropriate to expand on the current wording in the SmPC relating 
to concurrent use of canakinumab and live vaccines. A new warning in section 4.6 has been introduced 
recommending against the administration of live vaccines to newborn infants exposed to canakinumab in 
utero for 16 weeks following the mother’s last dose of Ilaris before childbirth. The patient alert card has been 
updated accordingly, to remind women who received canakinumab during pregnancy of the importance to 
inform the baby’s healthcare professional before any vaccinations are given to their newborn infant.  
Overall no difference in the safety profile in older patients compared to younger age groups could be 
detected. However, as the subset of of young adult SJIA patients aged 16 to 20 years, which most closely 
resembles the AOSD patients, the CHMP recommended that the MAH ensures that the results of a 
multi-centre, placebo-controlled, 12 week trial of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of canakinumab in 68 
AOSD patients is ongoing (ACZ885GDE01T/ NCT02204293) are submitted to the CHMP as soon as these are 
available.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of canakinumab does not differ in great extent between younger and older age groups with 
the diagnose SJIA. The analysis of the available safety data in patients with SJIA provides sufficient evidence 
that a similar safety profile can be expected for AOSD patients.

Review of the existing scientific literature in support of the extrapolation from SJIA to AOSD 
Review of the existing scientific literature was performed to demonstrate:   
(i) that SJIA and AOSD represent pediatric and adult-onset variants of the Still’s disease continuum with 
superimposable clinical and laboratory features, particularly with respect to the central role of IL-1 in their 
pathology; 
(ii) that IL-1 inhibition is an effective strategy in the treatment of Still’s disease including SJIA and AOSD. 
Assessment of the results of this literature search allowed identification of 28 references that were relevant 
to the topic of the relationship of SJIA and AOSD. Publications reporting the use of IL-1 inhibition in the 
treatment of AOSD were also identified, and after excluding abstracts of congress presentations where data 
were available from full, peer-reviewed publications this search revealed 72 publications that provided 
relevant information on the use of IL-1 blockade, namely anakinra and rilonacept, in the treatment of AOSD. 
As AOSD is a very rare disease (Gerfaud- Valentin et al 2014a), the number of relevant publications was 
relatively small, but sufficient to allow assessment of both topics. 
Relationship between SJIA and AOSD 
As expressed in several reviews of AOSD, the condition is generally considered to be either the same disease 
as SJIA (but occurring in adults), or to belong to a disease continuum that includes SJIA. The original 
description of AOSD by Bywater (1971) acknowledges this, in that the similarity of the adult cases in the 
series to cases of Still’s disease (i.e. SJIA) led to the naming of the condition. One review of the 
pathogenesis of AOSD (Jamilloux et al 2015a) included a direct comparison with SJIA, and summarized the 
available evidence from a small number of publications that compared various aspects of the two conditions. 
These studies have generally concluded that the two conditions are at least closely related, and that where 
differences exist (as noted by Pay et al (2006) and Sobieska et al (1998), see Section 5) these may be due 
to differences between adults and children in the expression of the same disease process, a conclusion 
shared by Jamilloux et al (2015a). While there remains some debate as to the degree of identity between 
AOSD and SJIA, the central role of IL-1 in the immunopathology of AOSD (as in SJIA) is well-established, as 
discussed in a number of reviews (Kadavath and Efthimiou 2015, Jamilloux et al 2015a, Jamilloux et al 
2015b, Maria et al 2014, Gerfaud-Valentin et al 2014a), and, as described below, demonstrated by the 
impressive efficacy of IL-1 inhibition in the treatment of this condition. 
IL-1 inhibition in the treatment of AOSD 
Treatment of AOSD with IL-1 inhibitors has been widely reported in the literature. The most studied IL-1 
inhibitor is anakinra, which was developed earlier than rilonacept and canakinumab (the first report of its use 
in this condition (Rudinskaya and Trock 2003) was published in 2003); most publications describing the use 
of IL-1 inhibition in the treatment of AOSD therefore cover anakinra. A controlled study, several surveys and 
case series, a meta-analysis including data from over 100 patients (Hong et al 2014), and numerous case 
reports provide evidence that inhibition of IL-1 is highly effective in relieving both systemic and, to a lesser 
extent, articular symptoms of AOSD. While systemic symptoms resolved rapidly, joint symptoms resolved 
more slowly and persisted in some cases. In some cases, corticosteroid and/or methotrexate could be 
tapered or stopped while maintaining remission. 
IL-1 inhibition as reported in the literature appears to be effective in treating both systemic and articular 
manifestations of AOSD, even in patients who are refractory to standard therapies and other biologics. 
Anakinra is the most studied IL-1 inhibitor in AOSD, with many case reports, several case series and a 
Assessment report  
EMA/493970/2016 
Page 45/57 
 
  
  
controlled study, which in total indicate that it is highly effective. Although a smaller body of evidence exists 
for the use of rilonacept and cankinumab in IL-1 inhibition in AOSD, case reports suggest that they are also 
effective therapies. 
Conclusions  
The MAH performed an extensive literature search to evaluate existing data on the relationship between 
SJIA and AOSD as well as the use of IL-1 inhibition in the treatment of AOSD. 
Patients included in the concerned studies, case reports, reviews are over 400, directly comparing AOSD and 
SJIA, over 430 patients in studies comparing clinical, laboratory or pathological aspects. Furthermore, data 
from more than 400 patients were presented focusing on the response to IL-1 inhibition in AOSD patients 
This literature supports to a great extent the position, that AOSD and SJIA share many common features, 
are closely related diseases, and even are a disease continuum.  Existing differences in the disease 
expression are explained with children reacting differently as a result of the first encounter of putative 
antigens with their immune systems. 
The results of the presented review are supporting the suggestion that SJIA and AOSD are two entities of the 
same disease and a disease continuum with different expressions in different ages of onset. 
The literature research focusing on the effect of IL-1 inhibition in AOSD supports the conclusion that IL-1 
inhibition is an effective instrument to reduce clinical signs and symptoms of AOSD, leads to normalization 
of laboratory parameters, and allows in many patients the clinically meaningful tapering of corticosteroids. 
Most evidence regarding the effect of IL-1 inhibition in AOSD relates to the use of anakinra, however case 
reports for treatment with canakinumab suggest a similar magnitude of efficacy.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, the information in section 4.6 of the 
SmPC has been updated with regard to the administration of live vaccines in newborns exposed in-utero to 
canakinumab. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring the annexes in line with the latest QRD 
template. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The changes to the package leaflet are minimal and only extend the scope of an approved paediatric 
indication to the adult population with no impact on the posology, the mode of administration, the safety 
profile or on the format/layout of the package leaflet.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
A detailed comparison of the efficacy of canakinumab treatment in SJIA patients between three age 
categories was submitted (2->12 years of age n=216, 12->16 years of age n=56, > 16 years of age n=29).  
Efficacy results in the three age groups were compared for the ACR pediatric response, number of active 
joints, number of joints with limitation of motion, CRP, Physician’s global assessment of disease activity, 
and CHAQ disability score. 
No major differences were observed in these clinically relevant efficacy endpoints between younger age 
groups and older age groups. Adapted ACR pediatric 30 response at Day 15 was achieved by 158/216 
(73.1%) of subjects in the 2 - <12 years old group, 47/56 (83.9%) of subjects in the 12 - <16 years old 
group, and 25/29 (86.2%) of subjects in the ≥16 years old group. The corresponding JIA ACR 30 responses 
at Day 15 were 78.2%, 83.9% and 86.2%, respectively. A trend can be seen to an even slightly better 
response on treatment in the older age group >16. 
Treatment effect was sustained over the prolonged assessment period until day 85 also in each of the three 
age groups, with adapted ACR 30 responses of 67.7%, 74.1% and 83.3% in the age groups of 2 - <12 years, 
12 - <16 years and ≥16 years, respectively. The adapted ACR 100 pediatric responses were 31.6%, 29.6% 
and 22.2% respectively for the 3 age groups.  
Changes from baseline in the seven ACR components were consistently similar or slightly greater in the  ≥16 
years age group. Median CRP values were less than 10 mg/L, i.e., normal by Day 15 in the eldest age group, 
and within the normal range in all age groups by Day 57. Overall, similar or better responses were seen in 
the two older age groups compared to the youngest patients <12 years of age. 
All 3 age groups also showed similar changes in DAS-28 (CRP) at Day 15 (median changes from baseline 
were -2.10 in the 2 - <12 years age group, -2.53 in the 12 - <16 years age group, and -2.37 in the ≥16 years 
age group). Median changes from baseline at Day 85 were also similar between the 12 - <16 years and ≥16 
years age groups (-3.76 and - 3.50, respectively), but smaller in the 2 - <12 years age group (-2.64). 
These results are supportive for the proposed change of indication to allow treatment in adults newly 
diagnosed with AOSD.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No formal studies of the use of canakinumab in the treatment of AOSD have been submitted.  
Even though the evaluated efficacy parameters strongly support that canakinumab use is equally effective 
across younger children, adolescents and adults, all patients randomized to the three pooled studies were 
diagnosed with SJIA and had their primary diagnosis in childhood. Nevertheless, given the similar genetic 
profiles and similar clinical responses to anti-IL-1 agents in AOSD and SJIA patients, it is reasonable to 
expect that the beneficial effects in SJIA will apply to the same extent in AOSD.

Unfavourable effects

The most frequent adverse events reported were in all three age groups infections and infestations, 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. There was some variation 
between age groups in exposure-adjusted total rates of AEs across the SOCs, and even though no clear 
pattern could be distinguished the overall rate of AEs is the lowest in the oldest population. 
MAS which is an AE of concern is monitored intensively through the Macrophage Activation Syndrome 
Adjudication Committee (MASCAC) which independently reviews adjudicates all cases identified through a 
search of the SJIA clinical program and the global safety databases events suggestive of MAS.   
The overall safety profile of canakinumab remains unchanged for older patients compared to younger age 
groups. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Patient number in the oldest age group is limited to 31 participants and therefore, safety data in adult 
patients is still limited. However, available safety results presented in a literature review, covering paediatric 
and adult patients do not indicate any new concerns for AOSD patients.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
AOSD is a rare, debilitating and difficult–to-treat disorder with no approved treatment options.  
SJIA and AOSD share many common features, including the clinical signs and symptoms at onset and in the 
serious complications that may arise. Through the available data from the older SJIA patients, and the 
literature search focusing on the effect of IL-1 inhibition in AOSD, it can be expected that canakinumab is  
effective in reducing clinical signs and symptoms of AOSD, leading to normalization of laboratory 
parameters, and allowing meaningful tapering of corticosteroids. 
Like paediatric and juvenile Still’s patients, adult-onset patients can also suffer from the rare and potentially 
fatal complication of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and other rare, multi-systemic complications. 
Other known risks associated with canakinumab use, such as infections and neutropenia or the potential risk 
of malignancies are expected to apply to AOSD patients. These risks are managed adequately through 
warnings in the SmPC and educational materials for health-care professionals and patient alert cards. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
This application is based on demonstration of similar biomarker and gene expression profiles in SJIA and 
AOSD patients, extrapolation of paediatric PK to the adult population to support the dosing recommendation, 
a review of the existing scientific literature, and pooled analyses of efficacy and safety data by age 
categories of 301 SJIA patients. 
The comparison of disease dysregulated genes in AOSD and SJIA which was performed with gene array 
analysis showed a strong concordance between the two diseases at the molecular/cellular level. 
Significantly, the published literature also supports to a great extent the position that AOSD and SJIA share 
many common features, and are closely related diseases.  The population PK analyses using all available 
Assessment report  
EMA/493970/2016 
Page 56/57 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data from SJIA patients support extrapolation of canakinumab PK from pediatric (SJIA) to adult (AOSD) 
patients. Based on available data, patients within the two populations would be exposed to a similar range 
of canakinumab level with the currently recommended dosing regimen for SJIA. 
The literature research focusing on the effect of IL-1 inhibition in AOSD strongly supports the notion that 
IL-1 inhibition is effective in reducing clinical signs and symptoms of AOSD and SJIA. Considering the known 
beneficial effects of canakinumab in the older SJIA patients, a similar positive effect can be reasonably 
expected for AOSD patients.  
No new risks are expected in AOSD patients compared to SJIA, and these are managed satisfactorily through 
labeling and additional risk management activities.  
The similarity of AOSD and SJIA together with the totality of available data from submitted studies in SJIA,  
are considered to give sufficient support to apply extrapolation of efficacy, PK and safety from the paediatric 
to the adult population leading to a positive benefit-risk balance for canakinumab in Adult-Onset Still’s 
Disease (AOSD). 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II, IIIA, 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
IIIB and 
Annex A 
Extension of Indication to amend the Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) indication to include 
treatment of active Still’s disease including Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD) in patients aged 2 years and 
older who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) and systemic corticosteroids; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, the information in 
section 4.6 of the SmPC has been updated with regard to the administration of live vaccines in newborns 
exposed in-utero to canakinumab.  In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring the annexes in line 
with the latest QRD template and to make a minor correction in the Annex A. An updated RMP version 10.2 
was agreed during the procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling, Package 
Leaflet, Annex A and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

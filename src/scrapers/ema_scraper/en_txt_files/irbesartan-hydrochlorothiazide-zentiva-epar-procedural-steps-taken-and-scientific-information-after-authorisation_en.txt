Annex II 
Please refer to the assessment report:  
Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC and requested the 
CHMP to assess the impact of nitrosamine impurities 
on the benefit-risk balance of valsartan-containing 
medicinal products and to issue a recommendation 
on whether the relevant marketing authorisations 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
During the CHMP plenary meeting in September 
2018, the scope of the referral has been widened to 
include all sartans with a tetrazole group in their 
molecular structure (candesartan, irbesartan, 
losartan, olmesartan and valsartan). The CHMP 
Opinion was issued on 31 January 2019 and the 
Commission Decision was issued on 15 April 2019. 
In a letter dated 29 July 2020, the European 
Commission requested the EMA to assess the impact 
of the outcome of the Article 5(3) assessment on 
nitrosamines adopted on 25 June 2020 on the 
CHMP's opinion of 31 January 2019 for the scientific 
assessment and review under Article 31 of Directive 
2001/83/EC regarding angiotensin-II-receptor 
Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva EMEA/H/A-

antagonists (sartans) containing a tetrazole group 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1471). The CHMP was requested to 
give its recommendation whether the conditions of 
the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

This type II variation application concerns an update

SmPC, Annex 
A total of six cases of ‘Acute Myopia’ and ‘Secondary Acute 
of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning on 
II, Labelling 
Angle-Closure Glaucoma’ were identified following a 
the risk of 'acute myopia' and 'secondary acute 
angle-closure glaucoma' associated with the use of 
hydrochlorothiazide. Further, section 4.8 of the 
SmPC has been updated to include the two ADRs 
'acute myopia' and 'secondary acute angle-closure 
glaucoma' and the Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH has taken the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes to the 
annexes and to revise the annexes in line with the 
latest QRD template (version 8.1). 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
and PL 
comprehensive literature review by the MAH. Two of them 
were considered related to the combination of irbesartan 
and HCTZ. Five cases reported bilateral ‘acute angle-
closure glaucoma’ and one reported ‘acute myopia’ and 
‘perimacular oedema’. It is acknowledged that concomitant 
drugs and medical history are potential confounding factors 
in all cases identified, but nevertheless a role of HTCZ in 
these cases cannot be ruled out. 
Although the number of reported cases of ‘acute angle-
closure glaucoma’ and ‘acute myopia’ is very small, the 
CHMP was of the view that this information should be 
reflected as a warning in the SmPC due to the seriousness 
of these ADRs that can lead to important visual disability, 
and the fact that other sulfa-derivated drugs have also 
been reported to cause the ADRs bilateral ‘acute myopia’ 
Page 21/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and ‘acute angle-closure glaucoma’. 
Therefore, it was agreed to add the following warning to 
the SmPC: 
“‘Acute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure 
Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide derivative 
drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in 
transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. While 
hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of 
acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported so far 
with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of 
decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur 
within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute 
angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. 
The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as 
rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments 
may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure 
remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute 
angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of 
sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.” 
The overall benefit-risk balance for the combination 
irbesartan + HCTZ remains unchanged.

on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Irbesartan 
Hydrochlorothiazide Winthrop continues to be favourable.  
The CHMP recommended the renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Winthrop, 
subject to the conditions as laid down in Annex II to the 
Opinion. The CHMP was also of the opinion that the renewal 
can be granted with unlimited validity.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
general description on what are the most serious and/or 
most frequently occurring adverse drug reactions. In 
support to this application, the MAH submitted a review of 
the Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS) as well as 
cumulative data from placebo-controlled hypertensive trials 
CV131-037,-038,-039, and -040. 
The updated section 4.8 includes now the following 
paragraph: 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: 
Among 898 hypertensive patients who received various 
doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide (range: 37.5 
mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 
29.5% of the patients experienced adverse reactions.  The 
most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), 
fatigue (4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal 
urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and 
creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in the 
trials.

spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled trials.

SmPC and PL  With this application, SPC section 4.5 the existing 
section 4.5 and Package Leaflet section 2 regarding 
information on the interaction of hydrochlorothiazide 
(HCTZ) with cholestyramin and colestipol resins. In 
particular to provide further guidance in the SPC to 
physicians on the recommended time between the 
administration of irbesartan + HCTZ and 
statement regarding an interaction with colestyramine and 
colestipol resins  has been amended indicating that 
irbesartan + hydrochlorothiazide should be taken at least 
one hour before or four hours after these medications. 
A literature search was performed by the MAH to identify

studies leading to a drug interaction between irbesartan, 
hydrochlorothiazide and cholestyramine. In a study with 
ten healthy adult male subjects evaluating appropriate 
dosing schedules of cholestyramine to minimize its effect 
on absorption, the investigators reported that the best 
dosing schedule for cholestyramine is 4 hours after 
hydrochlorothiazide (Hunninghake and Hibbard, 1986). On 
the other hand, it has been recommended that the 
administration of cholestyramine or colestipol have to be 
separated from the time of other medications (e.g. HCTZ) 
by 1-2 hours to minimize their effects on the absortion 
(Lamrini et al 1997; Hunninghake et al 1982).

Available data regarding use of AIIRAs during lactation 
4.3 and 4.6 as well as PL section 2 to implement the 
CHMP recommendation on a harmonised labelling 
have been assessed. There are no concrete data to support 
the contraindication of use of AIIRAs during breast-feeding.

relating to the use of Angiotensin II Receptor 
Antagonists during pregnancy and lactation. 
Furthermore, minor typographical changes have 
been introduced to SPC section 4.4. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
All AIIRA agents were found in the milk of lactating rats but 
no human data about their transfer into breast milk are 
available. There is only a theoretical presumption of low 
transport according to their high plasma protein binding 
and low oral availability. A harmonised wording 
recommending an alternative treatment with better 
established safety profiles during breast-feeding, especially 
while nursing a newborn or preterm infant, has been 
included in the section 4.6 of the SPC and section 2 of the 
PL. 
Consequently, the existing contraindication for lactation has 
been deleted.

the active substance 
to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Since the role of confounding factors such as diabetes and 
hypertension cannot be accurately defined based on the 
available data, the teratogenic potential of ACE inhibitors is 
not demonstrated, even though data suggest that such 
exposure cannot be considered as safe and should be 
avoided. 
There are fewer data regarding the risks associated with 
first trimester exposure to Angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists (AIIRAs) than for ACE inhibitors. Nevertheless, 
there is no evidence that the risk is lower for AIIRAs, and it 
is considered that any conclusions on ACE inhibitors are 
also valid for AIIRAs. 
Therefore, the existing contraindication for the 2nd and 3rd 
trimester of pregnancy remained, but a harmonised 
wording regarding pregnancy across the class was 
introduced.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns an extension of indication to include the first-line combination treatment with 
pembrolizumab and axitinib of adult patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  
Pembrolizumab 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the 
interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. This blockade enhances functional activity of 
the target lymphocytes to facilitate tumor regression and, ultimately, immune rejection. In vitro and in 
vivo  experiences  have  shown  that  PD-1  and  PD-L1  blockade  using  a  mAb  can  result  in  activation  of 
antitumor T cells and subsequent tumor regression. In T-cell activation assays using human donor blood 
cells, the EC50 was in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 nM. Pembrolizumab also modulates the level of IL-2, TNFα,

IFNγ,  and  other  cytokines.  The  antibody  potentiates  existing  immune  responses  in  the  presence  of 
antigen  only;  it  does  not  nonspecifically  activate  T  cells.  The  PD-1  pathway,  especially  the  PD-1 
receptor-ligand interaction, represents a major immune-control switch that may be engaged by ligands 
expressed  in  the  tumor  microenvironment  to  overcome  active  antitumor-specific  T  cell  immune 
surveillance. 
Keytruda  is  approved  in  EU  for  melanoma,  NSCLC  (both  monotherapy  and  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy), refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, urothelial carcinoma, and HNSCC.  
Clinical studies are being conducted in these tumor types, as well as in several other advanced solid tumor 
indications and hematologic malignancies. 
Axitinib 
Inlyta (axitinib) is an oral, potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth 
factor  receptors  (VEGFR)-1,  VEGFR-2  and  VEGFR-3.  These  receptors  are  implicated  in  pathologic 
angiogenesis, tumour growth, and metastatic progression of cancer. Axitinib has been shown to potently 
inhibit VEGFR-mediated endothelial cell proliferation and survival. Axitinib inhibited the phosphorylation 
of  VEGFR-2  in  xenograft  tumour  vasculature  that  expressed  the  target  in  vivo  and  produced  tumour 
growth delay, regression, and inhibition of metastases in many experimental models of cancer 
Inlyta is approved in EU for the treatment of advanced RCC after failure of 1 prior treatment with sunitinib 
or a cytokine. 
Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) 
RCC is the seventh most common cancer in men and the ninth most common in women, accounting for 
2% to 4% of all adult malignancies. Approximately 85% of renal tumors are RCC and approximately 70% 
of  these  are  of  clear  cell  histology.  Other  less  common  histologies  include  papillary,  chromophobe, 
translocation, and collecting duct tumors [NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: kidney cancer: 
version  3.2019].  Smoking,  obesity  and  hypertension  are  established  risk  factors  for  RCC.  Several 
hereditary conditions, such as von Hippel-Lindau disease, predispose patients to having an increased risk 
of developing RCC [NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: kidney cancer: version 3.2019]. At the 
initial diagnosis, approximately 65% of patients have localized disease; 16% have regional spread, and 
16% have distant metastasis [Siegel RL, et al. Cancer statistics, 2018. CA Cancer J Clin. 2018]. 
In Europe, the expected number of new cases and deaths from kidney cancer for 2018 is 136,500 and 
54,700,  respectively  [Ferlay  J,  et  al.  Eur  J  Cancer  2018;103:356-87.].  The  5-year  survival  rate  for 
advanced RCC is still poor, approximately 12% [NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: kidney 
cancer: version 3.2019]. 
Current Therapies for First-Line Advanced RCC  
A number of medicines are approved in EU for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC.  
According to the main guidelines (RCC: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and 
follow-up, update January 2019; NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: kidney cancer: version 
3.2019) tumor histology and risk stratification is important in treatment selection. The Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Prognostic Model has been the most widely used until recently to define 
risk  groups  of  patients  by  combining  five  independent  prognostic  factors  for  survival  (interval  from 
diagnosis to treatment less than 1 year, Karnofski PS<80%, serum lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]>1.5 
ULN, corrected serum calcium>ULN and serum hemoglobin<ULN). A prognostic model derived from a 
population of patients with metastatic RCC treated with VEGF-targeted treatment has been more recently 
developed, known as International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) score: this model take 
into  consideration  six  clinical  parameters  to  stratify  patients  into  favourable,  intermediate  and  poor 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 8/193 
 
 
 
prognosis groups: interval from diagnosis to treatment less than 1 year, Karnofski PS<80%, corrected 
serum calcium>ULN, serum hemoglobin<ULN, absolute neutrophil count>ULN and platelets>ULN. The 
IMDC model has been derived from a retrospective study of 645 patients treated with VEGF-targeted 
agents  (Heng  DY,  et  al.  J  Clin  Oncol  2009),  and  validated  in  an  independent  dataset  (Heng  DY,  et 
al.Lancet Oncol 2013). The 2-year OS ranges from 75% in the favourable risk group (none of the 6 factors 
identified) to 7% in the poor-risk group (3 to 6 factors identified). 
In the EU, the following agents targeting the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway are approved for the 1L 
treatment of advanced RCC: sunitinib, pazopanib, bevacizumab + IFNα, tivozanib and cabozantinib (in 
patients who are considered to be intermediate and poor risk). 
In addition to agents that target VEGFR and VEGF, other approved agents for advanced RCC include the 
mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus for patients considered to be poor risk (per the MSKCC risk category) in the 
1L setting and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. 
Recently, the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab was approved in the EU for use in treatment-naïve 
patients with advanced RCC who were considered to be intermediate or poor risk per the IMDC criteria. 
Axitinib  and  the  mTOR  inhibitor  everolimus,  as  single  agent  or  in  combination  with  lenvatinib,  are 
approved for patients with advanced RCC who have received prior treatment for their advanced disease. 
Nivolumab was also approved in the EU for the 2L+ setting after demonstrating a statistically significant 
and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared with everolimus in patients who had received 1 or 
2 prior anti angiogenic agents; however, this study failed to demonstrate an improvement in PFS. 
The current ESMO clinical practice guidelines recommend the following treatments for treatment-naïve 
patients with advanced RCC: 
Axitinib is only approved for the 2L treatment of advanced RCC. In a Phase 3 randomized study of axitinib 
versus sorafenib in treatment-naïve patients with advanced RCC (N = 288, randomized 2:1), axitinib 
failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS; however, 
axitinib demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in ORR [Hutson TE, et al. Lancet Oncol 2013; 
Hutson TE, et al., Clin Genitourin Cancer. 2017]. Based on these results, axitinib is considered by the 
NCCN as a treatment option (category 2B) for advanced RCC patients in the 1L setting [NCCN Clinical 
Practice Guidelines in Oncology: kidney cancer: version 3.2019].

Rationale for the combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib 
Angiogenesis is integral to the biology of RCC. As such, anti-angiogenic agents targeting VEGF/VEGFR 
have substantially improved clinical outcomes in patients with advanced RCC, and are considered among 
the standard 1L treatment option for advanced RCC.  
RCC has long been considered an immune-reactive tumor based on anecdotal reports of spontaneous 
remissions in advanced RCC patients with evidence of antigen specific lymphocyte infiltration of tumor 
tissues  [Wierecky  J,  et  al.  Cancer  Res  2006]  and  the  fact  that  high  dose  IL-2  could  produce  durable

long-term  responses  in  a  small  subset  of  advanced  RCC  patients.  In  RCC,  upregulation  of  the  PD-1 
receptor on TILs and its ligand PD-L1 on tumors is associated with more aggressive disease and poor 
prognosis [Pedoeem A, et al. Clin Immunol 2014; Ahmadzadeh M, et al. Blood 2009]. In addition to pro 
angiogenic  functions,  VEGF  has  been  shown  to  have  immunosuppressive  effects  [Johnson  BF,  et  al. 
Expert Opin Biol Ther 2007] and inhibition of VEGF signaling has been shown to enhance antigen-specific 
T-cell migration in RCC [Wallin JJ, et al. Nat Commun 2016]. The evidence supports targeting RCC with an 
immunotherapeutic approach in combination with inhibitors of the VEGF/VEGFR signaling axis.  
The  clinical  activity  of  an  anti-PD-1  agent  in  advanced  RCC  was  first  demonstrated  by  nivolumab  in 
patients  who  had  received  prior  anti-angiogenic  agents  [Motzer  RJ,  et  al.  N  Engl  J  Med  2015]. 
Pembrolizumab has shown clinical efficacy when administered as a monotherapy for the 1L treatment of 
advanced RCC (Study KEYNOTE-427 - Cohort A). Given the clinical success of targeting the either the 
VEGFR  or  PD-1  axis  independently,  targeting  these  2  pathways  could  provide  a  significant  benefit  to 
patients  with  advanced  RCC.  Specifically,  KEYNOTE-035  (Study  A4061079),  which  evaluated  the 
combination of axitinib and pembrolizumab in treatment-naive advanced RCC, demonstrated substantial 
clinical efficacy with an apparently acceptable safety profile. 
Based on the scientific rationale of targeting angiogenesis and immune-check point pathways, as well as 
the promising data from KEYNOTE-035, the combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib was tested in the 
pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 study.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from the submission of 
an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk 
to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products 
containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), the lack of ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Pharmacokinetic in target population 
Axitinib, as monotherapy, is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of 
one prior systemic therapy.  
Based  on  the  existing  robust  characterization  of  pembrolizumab  PK,  a  comparison  was  conducted 
between the observed PK of pembrolizumab for the current indication (RCC) in combination with axitinib 
and  the  predictions  from  the  reference  PK  model  developed  with  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  data 
(KEYNOTE-001, -002, -006, -010, and -024). This analysis is presented in the PK report (Report 052Z0C).  
DDI between pembrolizumab and Axitinib are unlikely, considering the divergent metabolic pathways for 
both  compounds.  However,  axitinib  could  be considered  to  have  immunomodulatory  effects  and  PK 
and/or 
immunogenicity assessments are planned in cases where pembrolizumab is combined with another agent 
with potential immunomodulatory effect. 
New  data  related  to  characterization  of  pharmacokinetics  for  the  combination  of  pembrolizumab  and 
axitinib, and a characterization of immunogenicity for pembrolizumab following co-administration with 
axitinib have been presented in this submission.  
Pembrolizumab PK data from KEYNOTE-426 (KN426) study 
PK samples were collected and measured for 423 subjects in KN0426 RCC (200 mg Q3W).  
PK sample schedule in KN426: Predose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) were obtained 
within 24 hours prior to dosing at cycles 1, 3, 5 and every 4 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter. Postdose serum 
concentrations (Cmax) were drawn within approximately 30 minutes after the end of the infusion in cycle 
1 and cycle 9. 
Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Version 6.3.0.395) software was used for pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Summary statistics of the observed pembrolizumab trough (pre-dose) and post-dose concentrations in 
RCC subjects from KN0426 are presented in the table below:

obtained about 30 minutes after the end of the infusion in cycle 1 and cycle 9. 
The observed concentrations in RCC patients treated with Pembrolizumab in combination with Axitinib 
generally  fall  within  the  range  of  predicted  concentrations,  both  after  first  dose  and  at  steady  state, 
although some low concentrations don’t fall in the 90% PI.

The single sequence DDI assessment in this study was conducted using a 7-day in Lead-in Cycle where 
daily 5 mg or 3 mg doses of axitinib were to be administered alone for 7 days, with axitinib full PK profile 
assessment  conducted  on  Day  7  of  the  Lead-in  Cycle.  Following  the  Lead-in  Cycle,  axitinib  was 
co-administered with MK-3475 continuously, with another axitinib full profile PK assessment conducted 
on Day 1 of Cycle 7. This design allowed comparison of the multiple dose PK of axitinib administered alone 
(Lead-in  Day  7)  to  the  multiple  dose  PK  of  axitinib  administered  in  combination  with  multiple  dose 
MK-3475 (Cycle 7 Day 1) to assess the potential effect of MK-3475 DDI on axitinib PK.

Overview of bioanalytical methods and assay validation 
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Quantification Method Validation 
The assay was originally developed and validated at Merck Research Laboratories (Oss, The Netherlands) 
in  September  2010.  A  full  assay  validation  was  performed  that  evaluated  assay  performance 
characteristics typical for validation of ligand binding assay methods. 
This first generation validated assay was not used to support quantitative bioanalysis of pembrolizumab 
concentrations in serum samples collected from clinical studies. This assay served as the foundation for 
later method transfer validation to the CRO, Intertek (San Diego, CA). 
Following transfer of the first generation Oss assay to Intertek, the method underwent refinement and 
transfer validation in August 2011 
The method (2nd generation assay, Report 4020) was used to support bioanalysis of MK-3475 in serum 
samples from clinical study P001. 
This  second  generation  method  validated  at  the  CRO  Intertek  was  updated  and  underwent  further 
validation in May 2013 to become the third generation assay. Method selectivity in normal and disease 
populations was one of the key performance characteristics investigated during partial re-validation to 
meet the guidance 
requirement to perform selectivity assessments using control samples prepared at the Lower Limit of 
Quantitation (LLOQ=10 ng/mL). 
This  third  generation  method  was  later  transferred  and  cross-lab  validated  at  a  second  CRO,  PPD 
(Richmond, VA) to increase the level of automation, increase of sample throughput and reduce variability. 
During the continued use of the 3rd generation assay at PPD it was noticed that variability at the LLOQ 
level of 10 ng/mL prevented the appropriate assessment of the influence of new disease states on the 
assay. Therefore, it was decided to raise the LLOQ of the assay and change the concentration of the QCs 
to appropriately span the new range of the assay. 
Accuracy and precision of the new QCs were assessed and appeared to be within the already established 
accuracy  and  precision.  Moreover,  due  to  the  logistical  difficulties  in  shipping  clinical  serum  samples 
collected in China from China to PPD laboratories in USA, the 3rd generation assay at PPD was transferred 
and cross-validated at Wuxi AppTec laboratories in Shanghai, China. 
The validated method at Wuxi is utilized to support Pembrolizumab drug concentration analysis for study 
protocols where Chinese subjects are enrolled through clinical sites in China. 
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) ADA Method Validation 
The  ADA  assay  was  originally  developed  and  validated  at  Merck  Research  Laboratories  (Oss,  The 
Netherlands) in November 2010, with a full assay validation. The assay was transferred to Intertek (San 
Diego, CA) and underwent method transfer validation in September 2011.  
The method was later transferred and re-validated at a second CRO, PPD (Richmond, VA) to perform ADA 
analysis at the same lab conducting quantitation of pembrolizumab in serum samples. 
Due to the logistical difficulties in shipping clinical serum sample out of China for bioanalytical testing, 
ADA method was fully validated at Wuxi AppTec laboratory in Shanghai, China to perform ADA analysis of 
samples for studies in which Chinese subjects are enrolled through clinical sites in China. 
With method developed at Intertek, the anti-CDR enriched ADA positive control at 250 ng/mL can tolerate 
up to 25 μg/mL of pembrolizumab. The method at PPD, which includes extended overnight incubation 
times and optimized acid neutralization timing for further drug tolerance enhancement, can tolerate up to 
124 μg/mL drug in an ADA positive control spiked at 250 ng/mL of anti-CDR enriched ADA. 
The method used at Wuxi achieved comparable drug tolerance to PPD; the method can tolerate up to 9
μg/mL drug in an ADA positive control spiked at 250 ng/mL of anti-CDR enriched ADA.

Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Nab Method Validation 
The first generation assay was originally developed and validated at Merck’s Oss site (The Netherlands) in 
January 2011. A full assay validation evaluated assay performance characteristics typical for neutralizing 
ADA  assays.    The  Oss  assay  method  was  transferred  to the  CRO,  Intertek  (San  Diego,  CA),  and  was 
transfer validated in December 2011.  The NAb assay method was redesigned and validated at a second 
CRO, PPD (Richmond, VA) as a second generation assay. The assay was validated at PPD in September 
2016.  
This  assay  was  later  transfer  validated  at  Wuxi  AppTec  in  Shanghai,  China  to  evaluate  neutralizing 
capacity of samples tested positive for ADA at Wuxi.

Report 054620:  Analysis of Samples Using an ECL Method for the Quantification of MK-3475 in Human 
Serum.  
This analysis was conducted for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. by PPD® Laboratories.  
Two  thousand  eight  hundred  thirty-nine  (2839)  original  and  two  thousand  seven  hundred  sixty-five 
(2765) replicate human serum samples were received frozen and in good condition in 45 shipments from 
Q2 Solutions (Valencia, California and Bath Gate, United Kingdom) between 21 December 2016 and 06 
September 2018. The samples were stored frozen at -80°C ± 10°C and all samples  were analyzed within 
the 1218 days demonstrated long-term storage stability in human serum at -80°C ± 10°C. 
The assay used in the analysis of study samples is a quantitative assay designed to quantify MK-3475 in 
human serum. 
A nominal MK-3475 concentration range of 25.0 to 800 ng/mL in 100% human serum was chosen to 
quantitate samples. The calibration standards ranged from 1.00 to 125 ng/mL, with anchor calibrators at 
1.00 and 125 ng/mL after correction for the 1:10 MRD. This assay required a minimum 20 μL human 
serum aliquot (or more for TECAN use). Calibration standards and quality control samples were prepared 
using  reference.  Standards  and  Certificates  of  Analysis  for  these  standards  are  attached  to  the 
bioanalytical report.  
Analysis of the human serum samples began on 25 April 2017 and was completed on 28 September 2018. 
Regression equations and correlation coefficients were calculated. The  Average Correlation Coefficient 
was  0.9976. Back-calculated calibration data are found in the following table: 
Precision  and  accuracy  were  evaluated  by  replicate  analyses  of  human  serum  quality  control  pools 
prepared at three concentrations spanning the calibration range. Precision was measured as the percent

Report 054623:  Analysis of Samples Using an Electrochemiluminescent (ECL) Method for the Detection 
of Anti-MK-3475 Neutralizing Antibodies in Human Serum 
Human serum samples were analyzed to detect anti-MK-3475 neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in support of 
Protocol Number MK-3475-426. 
Two thousand one hundred sixty-six (2166) original and three thousand one hundred sixty-two (3162) 
replicate human serum samples were received frozen and in good condition in 42 shipments from Q2 
Solutions  (Valencia,  California  and  Bath  Gate,  United  Kingdom)  between  21  December  2016  and  06 
September 2018. These samples were first tested in the electro-chemiluminescent immunoassay for the 
detection  of  anti-MK-3475  antibodies.  Samples  that  were  confirmed  to  be  positive  for  anti-MK-3475 
antibodies were tested for neutralizing capacity. The assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies to 
MK-3475  (ICDIM  202  V  2.01)  from  Protocol  MK-3475-426  was  assigned  the  unique  PPD  project  code

Method ICDIM 202 V 2.01. 
Analysis of human serum samples took place in six runs beginning on 19 December 2017 and ending on 
28 September 2018.  See below in section “Immunogenicity”. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA  is  an  antibody  that  binds  to  the  programmed  death-1  (PD-1)  receptor  and  blocks  its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that 
has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell 
responses,  including  anti-tumour  responses,  through  blockade  of  PD-1  binding  to  PD-L1  and  PD-L2, 
which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the 
tumour microenvironment. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy setting is based on a 
sufficiently  large  dataset  of  patients  across  several  indications,  with  very  low  observed  rates  of  total 
treatment emergent ADA (1.4 - 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%). This analysis 
has not demonstrated impact on efficacy or safety, as currently summarized in the USPI and EU SmPC. 
This  low  rate  of  immunogenicity  has  been  shown  to  be  consistent  across  tumor  type  and  no  clinical 
consequences have been observed in the subjects with a positive immunogenicity reading. 
Immunogenicity evaluation for study KEYNOTE-426 
For  pembrolizumab  combination  therapy  (200  mg  pembrolizumab  Q3W  +  5  mg  axitinib  BID),  ADA 
samples were available from 434 subjects. A subset of the subjects was not assessable for drug-induced 
immunogenicity  because  the  subjects  were  not  treated  with  pembrolizumab  (N=12)  or  only  a 
pre-treatment  ADA  sample  was  available  (N=16).  The  remaining  406  subjects  were  included  in  the 
immunogenicity assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 23/193 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The table below presents an overview of the immunogenicity status of all assessable subjects. 
To  evaluate  immunogenicity,  the  overall  immunogenicity  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  emergent 
positive subjects to the total number of evaluable subjects (treatment emergent positive, non-treatment 
emergent positive and negative immunogenicity status). 
The  observed  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  ADA  in  evaluable  subjects  after  pembrolizumab 
combination therapy is 6.2% (24 out of 389), based on 24 subjects with treatment emergent positive, 7 
with non-treatment emergent positive and 358 with negative immunogenicity status. Three of the 24 
treatment emergent positive subjects, had antibodies with neutralizing capacity, yielding an incidence of 
treatment emergent neutralizing positive subjects of 0.8% (3 out of 389). 
Impact of ADA on Pembrolizumab Exposure 
The effect of ADA on pembrolizumab levels, for the subjects with ADA positive samples, is compared with 
the subjects treated with the same regimen that only have ADA negative samples.

For all of the ADA positive subjects, the pembrolizumab exposure was similar to that for other subjects 
treated with the same regimen. 
Impact of ADA on Pembrolizumab Safety 
The  ADA  positive  subjects  (treatment  emergent  and  non-treatment  emergent),  were  evaluated  for 
potential  impact  on  safety.  The  safety  profile  in  ADA  positive  subjects  was  compared  with  negative 
subjects. (see table below)

Only an exploratory impact of ADA on overall survival (OS) over time was visually examined, considering 
that there are only three subjects with TE Nab positive status. The figure shows that OS was similar across 
all ADA subgroups.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new information regarding PK/PD modelling for pembrolizumab is available within this extension of 
indication. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology results for the combination therapy of Pembrolizumab together with axitinib 
specific to support approval for first line treatment of advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 
are available from the pivotal study KEYNOTE-426 and the Pfizer-sponsored study KEYNOTE-035 (Study 
A4061079). 
A substantial characterization of the key clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity findings of 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy have been provided in previous submissions. Axitinib, as monotherapy, 
is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of one prior systemic therapy.  
Based on the existing robust characterization of pembrolizumab PK, a comparison was conducted 
between the observed PK of pembrolizumab for the current indication (RCC) in combination with axitinib 
and the predictions from the reference PK model developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy data 
(KEYNOTE-001, -002, -006, -010, and -024).  
Predose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) were obtained within 24 hours prior to dosing at 
cycles 1, 3, 5 and every 4 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter. Postdose serum concentrations (Cmax) were 
obtained about 30 minutes after the end of the infusion in cycle 1 and cycle 9. 
The observed concentrations in RCC patients treated with Pembrolizumab in combination with Axitinib 
generally fall within the range of predicted concentrations, both after first dose and at steady state, 
although some low concentrations don’t fall in the 90% PI. 
As  requested,  the  MAH  provided  tabular  summaries  of  descriptive  statistics  and  boxplots  comparing 
observed pembrolizumab concentrations of 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) from participants with RCC in 
KEYNOTE-426 in combination with axitinib with those obtained with the 200 mg Q3W flat dose for other 
tumor types in the monotherapy setting. These data showed the consistency among exposure obtained in 
monotherapy with those obtained in combination therapy. 
Treatment comparison for axitinib PK parameters (study A4061079) showed that median axitinib plasma 
concentration-time profiles were comparable when axitinib was administered alone and with 
pembrolizumab. In addition, comparison of axitinib exposures, as assessed by the PK parameters 
dose-normalized AUC12 and Cmax, when axitinib was administered alone or in combination, yielded 
geometric ratios of 1.23 and 0.94 respectively, indicating no clinically meaningful DDI effect. 
The exposures observed in this study with or without co-administration of pembrolizumab are within the 
range of exposures historically observed with axitinib. 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy setting is based on a 
sufficiently large dataset of patients across several indications, with very low observed rates of total 
treatment emergent ADA (1.4 - 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%). 
For pembrolizumab combination therapy (200 mg pembrolizumab Q3W + 5 mg axitinib BID), ADA 
samples were available from 434 subjects (only 406 subjects were included in the final immunogenicity 
assessment). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 27/193 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA to pembrolizumab in subjects with RCC treated with 
pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib was ~6% (24 out of 389 total evaluable samples) that is 
higher compared to the overall incidence in the monotherapy setting (1.8%).  
Three out of 24 treatment emergent ADA positive patients had neutralising antibodies against 
pembrolizumab (0.8%). The percentage of ADA positive patients with neutralising properties is similar 
with the overall incidence in the monotherapy setting. 
There was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic or safety profile with anti-pembrolizumab binding or 
neutralising antibody development. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The observed concentration from KEYNOTE-426 falls within the 90% CI of the model predicted median 
concentration. Although the number of treatment emergent ADA is higher when pembrolizumab is 
combined with axitinib, treatment emergent ADA status is not found to alter the PK, efficacy and safety of 
the combination regimen. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The proposed indication is based on the results from KEYNOTE-426, an on-going randomized, 
multi-center, open-label, global phase 3 study investigating pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib 
vs sunitinib monotherapy as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic RCC.  
Data from KEYNOTE-427 (Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants with RCC) for 
participants with clear cell RCC (Cohort A), and the Pfizer-sponsored Study A4061051 (Phase 3 study of 
axitinib versus sorafenib in treatment-naïve RCC patients) are submitted as supportive with the aim to 
provide the contribution of each of the components to the efficacy of the pembrolizumab + axitinib 
regimen, together with the results of the Pfizer sponsored study KEYNOTE-035/A4061079 (Phase 1b of 
pembrolizumab + axitinib in RCC), which provided the rationale for evaluating pembrolizumab in 
combination with axitinib in participants with advanced RCC. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study KN-035 was a Phase 1b, open label, single-arm, multi-center, multiple-dose, safety, efficacy, PK 
and  pharmacodynamics  study  of  axitinib  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  in  adult  patients  with 
previously untreated advanced RCC. This clinical study comprised of a Dose Finding Phase and a Dose 
Expansion Phase. In this trial, the axitinib starting dose was 5 mg BID with or without food, i.e. the dose 
approved for the indication of second-line treatment of adults with advanced RCC. The pembrolizumab 
starting dose was 2 mg/kg to be administered Q3W. 
This study estimated an MTD of axitinib 5 mg BID and pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg intravenously (IV). During 
the dose-finding phase, there were 3 (27.3%) out of 11 patients who experienced DLTs during the first 2 
cycles or 6 weeks post C1D1. One patient had transient ischemic attack (TIA) and two patients were 
unable to complete ≥75% of planned axitinib dose due to treatment-related toxicity (one due to grade 2/3 
headache and the other due to grade 2 headache, fatigue, asthenia, and dehydration). 
A total of 52 patients were enrolled into the study from 16 September 2014, including the first 11 patients 
enrolled in the Dose Finding Phase. 
Overall, the combination of axitinib and pembrolizumab was safe and tolerable. No new safety signals 
were identified with axitinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated

advanced RCC; the safety profile of either study drug was consistent with the known safety profile when 
used as single agent. 
The most frequently reported AEs such as diarrhea and fatigue were similar to those found in 
monotherapy trials. No treatment-related deaths during the study was reported. 
At the data cut-off date of 31 March 2017, the confirmed ORR was 73.1% (95% CI [59.0, 84.4]), with a 
best overall response of CR reported for 4 patients and PR reported for 34 patients. The median duration 
of tumor response was 18.6 months (95% CI [15.1, NR]).The median TTR was 2.8 months (range: 0.7 - 
15.2 months).  
The median PFS was 20.9 months (15.4, NR) among all the treated patients. The median OS in the 
current study was not reached at the minimum follow-up period of 17.6 months; the majority of patients 
[43 (82.7%) patients] were still alive at the time of data cut-off.  
Overall, 48 patients had their tumor tissue evaluated for PD-L1 status. Nine (18.8%) patients had a tumor 
PD-L1 status positive; 34 (70.8%) patients had a tumor PD-L1 status negative. Four (8.3%) patients had 
a tumor PD-L1 status of not evaluable, while 1 (2.1%) patient was missing the PD-L1 status. Of the 9 
patients with tumor PD-L1 status positive, 8 (88.9%) patients had partial response and 1 (11.1%) had 
indeterminate response. Of the 34 patients with tumor PD-L1 status negative, 4 (11.8%) patients had 
complete response, 20 (58.8%) patients had partial response, 6 (17.6%) patients had stable disease, 2 
(5.9%) patient had progressive disease, and 2 (5.9%) patients had intermediate response. Of the 4 
patients without tumor PD-L1 status available, 3 (75%) patients had PR, and 1 patient had SD, while the 
patient missing the PD-L1 status had a PR. 
Based on these data suggesting the tolerability and anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of axitinib and 
pembrolizumab, the MAH designed Study KN-426. In this trial, the pembrolizumab dose was 200 mg 
Q3W. The rational is based on the fact that an integrated body of evidence suggests that 200 mg Q3W is 
expected to provide similar response to 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W.  Exposures 
for 200 mg Q3W are expected to lie within this range and close to those obtained with the 2 mg/kg Q3W 
dose.  
The 200 mg Q3W dose currently recommended for all the approved indications of pembrolizumab (as 
monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy), and is being evaluated in multiple clinical studies.

treatment groups. Subsequently, the treatment was to be administered on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. 
For participants in the pembrolizumab + axitinib group, each treatment cycle was 21 days (+/- 3 days) to 
correspond with the dosing schedule of pembrolizumab. The first dose of axitinib was to start on the same 
day when first dose of pembrolizumab was administered or on the following day. For participants in the 
sunitinib group, each treatment cycle was 42 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 31/193 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pembrolizumab, axitinib, and sunitinib were withheld for drug-related toxicities and severe or 
life-threatening AEs. The axitinib dose could be adjusted by a dosing interruption with or without dose 
reduction as indicated. The dose modification could occur independently for the 2 drugs used in the 
pembrolizumab plus axitinib arm. If axitinib dose reduction from 5 mg BID was required, the next 
recommended dose levels were 3 mg BID and 2 mg BID. Axitinib was permanently discontinued if 
subjects could not tolerate 2 mg BID.  
Subjects who tolerated axitinib 5 mg BID for 2 consecutive treatment cycles (i.e. 6 weeks) with no > 
Grade 2 treatment-related AEs to axitinib and with BP well controlled to ≤ 150/90 mm Hg could have 
axitinib dose increased to 7 mg BID, and further increased to 10 mg BID using the same criteria. 
For sunitinib, the study used the label-recommended dose and schedule for RCC (50 mg QD 4 weeks on, 
2 weeks off). Dose interruption and/or dose modification in 12.5 -mg increments or decrements was 
recommended based on individual safety and tolerability, as per label recommendations. 
Study treatments continue until progressive disease (PD) is BICR-verified or further confirmed by the 
investigator, unacceptable adverse events (AEs) or intercurrent illness prevents further administration of 
treatment, death or withdrawal of consent. For both arms, in the event that a complete response (CR) has 
been observed in a subject, study treatment may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator 
after the CR has been confirmed and after a minimum of 8 cycles of treatment (~24 weeks) in the 
pembrolizumab plus axitinib arm or 4 cycles of treatment (~24 weeks) in the sunitinib arm have been 
received. In the combination arm, treatment could continue with one drug if the other had been 
discontinued due to adverse reactions. Pembrolizumab is administered for a maximum of 35 doses.

Sample size 
The study was event-driven and planned to randomize approximately 840 subjects with 1:1 ratio into the 
two treatment groups pembrolizumab plus axitinib and sunitinib.  
Both PFS and OS are primary endpoints for this study. For the PFS endpoint, based on a target number of 
487 PFS events and one interim analysis at approximately 75% of the target number of events, the study 
has ~99% power to detect an HR of 0.60 (pembrolizumab+axitinib combination versus sunitinib) at 
alpha=0.2% (1-sided). The calculation assumes an HSD alpha-spending function with γ=-2 to control the 
overall Type I error rate for this endpoint at 0.2% (1-sided). The target numbers of PFS events for the first 
interim and final analysis are projected to occur at 22 and 31 months respectively. The IA1 was triggered 
when 305 PFS events had accrued and all participants were followed for at least 7 months after 
randomization. For the OS endpoint, based on a target number of 404 final OS events and 2 interim 
analyses (with approximately 48% of final OS events at IA1 and 74% of the final OS events at IA2), the 
study has approximately 80% power to detect an HR of 0.75 at an overall alpha level of 2.3% (1-sided). 
The calculation assumes that a linear alpha-spending function with a fixed alpha-spending of 0.0001 at 
IA1 and the rest alpha-spending approximated by an HSD alpha-spending function withγ=-4 to control 
the overall Type I error rate for this endpoint at 2.3% (1-sided). The target number of OS events is 
projected to occur at 43 months after the start of the study. The target numbers of OS events for the first 
and second interim analyses are projected to occur at 22 months and 31 months respectively. The 
calculations assume an exponential distribution with a median of 13 months for PFS and a median of 33 
months for OS for the control group respectively, a yearly dropout rate of 10% for PFS and 1% for OS, 
and an enrollment of 15 months, with monthly accrual of 40 to 60 patients in the first 3 months and 
monthly accrual of ~60 patients after the first 3 months. The median PFS and median OS assumptions in 
the control group are based on emerging data of sunitinib from the CheckMate 214 study. 
Randomisation 
Treatment randomization occurred centrally using an interactive voice response system/integrated web 
response system (IVRS/IWRS). Subjects were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to the pembrolizumab 
plus axitinib combination arm or the sunitinib monotherapy arm. 
Prior to randomization subjects will be stratified according to the following factors: 
1. International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group: favourable versus intermediate 
versus poor risk groups  
2. Geographic region: North America versus Western Europe versus “Rest of the World”. 
IMDC risk category for each subject was determined first by assessing 6 risk factors as shown in the table 
below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 34/193 
 
 
 
 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted in an open-label fashion, with a blinded independent radiologist review of 
responses. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population. 
The  non-parametric  Kaplan-Meier  method  was  used  to  estimate  the  OS  and  the  PFS  curve  in  each 
treatment group including the PFS rates at 12, 18, and 24 months. The treatment difference in PFS was 
assessed by the stratified log -rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method 
of tie handling was used to estimate the magnitude of the treatment difference between the treatment 
arms. The hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method 
of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate was reported. The  stratification factors used for 
randomization was applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. 
The true date of disease progression was approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD is 
objectively documented per RECIST 1.1 by BICR. Death was always considered as a confirmed PD event. 
Subjects who did not experience a PFS event were censored at the last disease assessment.  The 
censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses* are summarized in the following table.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 35/193 
 
 
 
 
 
 
* The Sensitivity analysis was performed for comparison of PFS based on investigator's assessment using 
primary censoring rule. 
Stratified Miettinen and Nurminens method with weights proportional to the stratum size was used for 
comparison of the objective response rates (ORR) and of the DCR between the treatment arms. A 95% CI 
for the difference in response rates between the treatment arms was provided. The stratification factors 
used for randomization were applied to the analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess ORR 
and DCR based on investigator's assessment. 
The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the DOR curve in each treatment group; 
estimates of the percentage of subjects still in response and 95% CIs at specific duration time points was 
provided. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess DOR based on investigator's assessment. 
The overall Type I error across the testing of the OS, PFS, and ORR hypotheses was strongly controlled at 
2.5% (1-sided) with 0.2% initially allocated to PFS and 2.3% initially allocated to OS. If a hypothesis was 
rejected, then the corresponding alpha level of that test could be shifted using the graphical approach of 
Maurer and Bretz (see figure below). 
Two interim analyses were planned for OS and one planned interim analysis for PFS for the study. A group 
sequential approach was used to allocate alpha between the interim and final analyses. The study was 
considered a success if either PFS or OS is demonstrated to be statistically significant under multiplicity 
control.

The following table show the strategies for each interim and final analysis in this trial based on model 
assumptions. 
The MAH planned to update the boundary using the actual number of PFS and of OS events at the interim 
and final analyses and the same spending function used to derive the design. 
The results of the study are based on the IA1 that was performed after enrollment completion, when a 
minimum of 305 PFS events had accrued and all participants were followed for at least 7 months after 
randomization.  
For  PRO  endpoints  no  formal  hypothesis  testing,  nominal  p-values  were  provided  for  treatment 
comparisons of pembrolizumab + axitinib vs. sunitinib. No multiplicity adjustment was performed. The 
following table summarizes the planned PRO analyses.

detailing  evaluation  and  management  of  transaminase  elevations 
during  axitinib  and  pembrolizumab  combination  therapy  (Section 
5.2.2.3). The rational for this change was to provide detailed guidelines 
on  how  to  systemically  approach  treatment–emergent  alanine 
aminotransferase  [ALT]/aspartate  aminotransferase  [AST]  elevations 
in the pembrolizumab + axitinib group as there are no specific markers 
to  differentiate  drug-induced  liver  injury 
from  axitinib  versus 
immune-mediated  hepatitis  from  pembrolizumab  versus  ALT/AST 
elevations due to other reasons. The amedment also provided detailed 
algorithms  regarding  study  drug  rechallenge  for  different  scenarios 
following recovery from an initial ALT/AST elevation event.

Third Global Amendment 
The primary reason for the amendment was to revise Table 6 in Section 
5.2.2.1 (Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for 
Adverse Events Potentially Associated with Pembrolizumab Treatment), 
to include: 1) myocarditis as a new immunerelated AE (irAE); and 2) 
under all the “other immune-related AEs”, any Grade 3 AE was 
separated from intolerable Grade 2 as a standalone category. These 
updates were required to be consistent with the guidelines provided in 
the IB and product label that were current at that time.

Fourth Global Amendment - Statistical Analysis Plan:  
1) Revised assumptions on control arm median PFS and OS 
2) Revised IA1 trigger from 50% final OS events to once achieving 305 
PFS events and 7 months of minimum follow up. 
3)  Added  one  interim  analysis  for  PFS  to  have  earlier  chance  of 
observing positive efficacy of PFS with relatively mature data. 
4) Initial alpha to PFS and OS changed from 0.1% and 2.4% to 0.2% 
and  2.3%  respectively.  Slightly  higher  alpha  is  reallocated  to  PFS  to 
ensure  adequate  power  for  this  important  primary  endpoint  without 
compromising the power of OS 
5) Secondary objectives: landmark analyses on PFS and OS are added 
to compare and characterize the tail of the curve (PFS rate per RECIST 
1.1 as assessed by BICR at 12, 18, and 24 months, and OS rates at 12, 
18, and 24 months, based on data adequacy). 
6) Updated the censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses of 
PFS. 
#13 (11 May 2018) 
Country specific (France) version of global amendment #12 
Note: There was only 1 country-specific protocol amendment for Japan, which was protocol amendment 
426-01. Protocol amendment 426-04 was global amendment 426-03 with changes from 426-01 carried 
over. 
There was only 1 country-specific protocol amendment for France, which was amendment 426-02. 
Protocol amendments 426-05, -09, -11 and -13 were global amendments 426-03, -08, -10 and -12 with 
changes from 426-02 carried over. 
Protocol deviations   
The percentage of participants with important deviations, defined as deviations that could significantly 
impact the quality (ie, completeness, accuracy, and reliability) or integrity of key study data; or that could 
significantly affect a participant’s rights, safety, or well-being, was similar in the 2 groups (14.2% in the 
pembrolizumab + axitinib group and 12.9% in the sunitinib group). 
Deviations were reported across the following categories: 
•  Discontinuation criteria (n=0 for pembrolizumab + axitinib; n=1 for sunitinib) 
• 
• 
• 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria (n=14 for pembrolizumab + axitinib; n=12 for sunitinib) 
Informed consent form (n=0 for pembrolizumab + axitinib; n=1 for sunitinib) 
Prohibited medications (n=2 for pembrolizumab + axitinib; n=1 for sunitinib) 
•  Safety reporting (n=19 for pembrolizumab + axitinib; n=14 for sunitinib) 
•  Study intervention (n=6 for pembrolizumab + axitinib; n=3 for sunitinib) 
• 
Trial procedures (n=27 for pembrolizumab + axitinib; n=27 for sunitinib) 
Of these important protocol deviations, one was deemed to be clinically significant. One participant in the 
pembrolizumab + axitinib group experienced an SAE (peritonitis) that was reported to the Sponsor more 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019

than  90  days  after  the  SAE  occurred.  The  SAE  resolved  with  no  action  taken  with  regard  to  study 
treatment,  and  the  participant  continued  in  the  study.  The  participant  was  not  excluded  from  any 
analyses. 
Of  note  is  that  2  patients  in  the  experimental  arm  received  prohibited  medication  defined  as 
"Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, other investigational agents 
given  while  on  treatment  (unless  allowed  per  protocol)".  The  prohibited  medication  received  by  the 
patients in the control arm was instead a drug having pro-arrhythmic potential. The rate of patients with 
"2 consecutive Imaging Scans up to week 54 or 1 imaging scan after Week 54, not performed for all 
anatomical locations required or missed entirely" was slightly higher in the experimental arm (5.1% vs 
4%).

 *The sites are five most common metastatic sites and ordered decreasingly by the frequency in total of the 
two treatment arms. Database Cutoff Date: 24Aug2018. 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population, which included participants in the treatment group to 
which they were randomly assigned, regardless of whether or not they received study treatment. 
Table: Study Population 
PRO analyses were based on the FAS population, which consisted of all randomized participants who 
received at least 1 dose of study medication and completed at least 1 PRO assessment.

Table: Disposition of Subjects 
A breakdown of the disposition of participants by individual component in the pembrolizumab + axitinib 
group shows that the percentage of participants who discontinued either pembrolizumab or axitinib (with 
or without discontinuation of the other drug) was similar. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The  MAH  provided  the  results  of  IA1.  As  of  the  data  cutoff  date  (24-AUG-2018)  for  IA1,  the  median 
duration of follow up was 13.2 months (range: 0.1 to 21.5 months) in the pembrolizumab + axitinib group 
and 12.1 months (range: 0.4 to 22.0 months) in the sunitinib group.

Patient Reported Outcomes 
In the pembrolizumab + axitinib group, PROs were  assessed on Day 1 of each cycle.  In the sunitinib 
group,  PROs  were  assessed  on  Days  1  and  29  of  each  cycle  up  to  Cycle  4,  then  on  Day  1  of  each 
subsequent cycle following the 2-week-off treatment period. Compliance rates for the FKSI-DRS by visit 
and by treatment at baseline through Week 30 were high (range: 85.9% through 97.1%) in both groups. 
The compliance rates for EORTC QLQ-C30 [Table 14.2-55] and EQ-5D-3L [Table 14.2-56] were similar to 
that for the FKSI-DRS. As expected, completion rates generally decreased at each time point as more 
participants discontinued the study treatment. 
Time to True Deterioration from Baseline in the FKSI-DRS 
The time to true deterioration (time to first onset of 3 or more decrease from baseline with confirmation 
under right-censoring rule) in the FKSI-DRS differed between the 2 groups in favor of sunitinib (HR 1.44; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 51/193 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
95% CI: 1.14, 1.82; nominal p=0.999).  At the time of data cutoff, the median time to true deterioration 
was not reached in either treatment group.

Analysis) (FAS Population) 
EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life Change From Baseline to Week 30 
There were no clinically meaningful differences from baseline to Week 30 in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global 
health status/QoL score for participants in both the pembrolizumab + axitinib group and the sunitinib 
group.  Greater  worsening  (ie,  increase  in  score)  from  baseline  to  Week  30  in  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30 
symptom  scale  for  diarrhea  was  observed  for  participants  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  axitinib  group 
compared with those in the sunitinib group. Diarrhea is an AE associated with both pembrolizumab and 
axitinib.

Subsequent Anticancer Treatments for RCC 
A lower percentage of participants in the pembrolizumab + axitinib group compared with the sunitinib 
group received any subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy by type or across lines for advanced RCC. 
The most common type of subsequent anticancer therapy administered in the pembrolizumab + axitinib 
group was a VEGF/VEGR inhibitor (most commonly cabozantinib, sunitinib, axitinib, or pazopanib), with a 
frequency  that  was  similar  to  that  in  the  sunitinib  group.  A  higher  percentage  of  participants  in  the 
sunitinib group received a PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor (most commonly nivolumab) as subsequent 
anticancer therapy compared with the pembrolizumab + axitinib group.

Recurrent vs. newly diagnosed RCC 
For OS, the HRs (95% CIs) are 0.43 (0.26, 0.73) and 0.65 (0.42, 0.99) for the subgroups with recurrent 
and newly diagnosed disease, respectively. For PFS, the HRs (95% CIs) are 0.74 (0.55, 0.99) and 0.66 
(0.50, 0.87) for these same subgroups. These results indicate a comparable treatment effect in OS and 
PFS in both subgroups.

Study KEYNOTE-427 
KEYNOTE-427 is an ongoing, Phase 2, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-cohort, multicenter, global study of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab as 1L treatment for 
locally advanced/metatsatic ccRCC (Cohort A) and nccRCC (Cohort B) in adult participants who had not 
previously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Patients were required to have measurable 
disease  per  RECIST  1.1.  as  assessed  by  BICR.  Key  exclusion  criteria  were  prior  treatment  with  any 
anti-PD-1, or PD-L1, or PD-L2 agent or an antibody targeting any other immune-regulatory receptors or 
mechanisms, diagnosis of immunodeficiency, treatment with systemic steroid therapy or any other form 
of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to allocation (except in the case of central nervous 
system metastases), active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 2 years OR 
a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, and known active central nervous system 
metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. 
Eligible participants in Cohort A (N=110) were treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W until a total of 
35  doses  had  been  administered  or  until  documented  PD,  unacceptable  AEs,  or  any  of  the  other 
discontinuation  criteria  were  met,  as  outlined  in  the  protocol.  Participants  were  evaluated  with 
radiographic imaging to assess response to treatment at baseline, after randomization at Week 12, then 
Q6W  until  Week  54,  and  Q12W  thereafter.  All  participants  are  being  followed  for  survival  (by  phone 
contact or clinic visit) until death, withdrawal of consent, being lost to follow-up, or until the study is 
concluded or terminated early, whichever occurs first. 
The primary endpoint is ORR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR. Key secondary endpoints include DOR, DCR and 
PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, and OS. There will be no formal hypothesis testing in this study. The overall 
sample size selection is based on the confidence interval (CI) width that will provide the appropriate level

of  precision  needed  for  estimation.  The  planned  sample  size  is  approximately  105  subjects  in  ccRCC 
cohort. With a sample size of 105 subjects with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, the half-width of 95% 
confidence interval varies between 8% and 10% when the observed response rates vary from 20% to 
60%.  No  power  calculation  is  provided.  Efficacy  analyses  were  based  on  the  ASaT  population,  which 
consisted of 110 allocated participants in Cohort A who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. The 
analysis population for DOR consisted of responders.

BICR confirmed ORR of 36.4% was achieved; 3 (2.7%) participants had a CR and 37 (33.6%) participants 
had PR.

Overall, the ORR was consistent across demographic and other predetermined subgroups with the 
exception of the analyses by gender and PD-L1 status. ORR is lower in females (16.7%) compared with 
males (41.9%); however, the small sample size precludes a meaningful analysis. 
As the cutpoint for PD-L1 status (positive vs negative) was chosen in an attempt to discriminate response 
by CPS score based on results from an earlier database lock, the ORR was higher for participants with CPS 
≥1 (44.2%) compared with CPS <1 (29.3%) with overlapping 95% CIs. 
Analysis results, based on investigator assessment, were consistent with the primary analysis results, 
based on BICR. 
As of the data cutoff date, the median DOR was not reached; 63.6% (18 of the 40 responders) of 
participants had an extended response duration of ≥12 months. Disease control was achieved by 57.3% 
(63 of 110) of participants. The median PFS for participants was 7.1 months; the PFS rate at 12 months 
was 37.6%. As of the data cutoff date, the median OS was not reached; the OS rate at 12 months was 
88.2%.

(ASaT Population) 
Study A4061051 (Pfizer Sponsored): 
Study  A4064051  was  a  Phase  3,  randomized,  open-label,  multicenter  study  sponsored  by  Pfizer  to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of axitinib versus sorafenib as a 1L treatment for metastatic RCC. Key 
eligibiity criteria were 
Eligible participants were required to meet eligibility criteria, i.e. histologically or cytologically confirmed 
ccRCC with metastasis, with no prior systemic first-line therapy (prior adjuvant therapy with interferon 
(IFN) and/or interleukin allowed if recurrence occurred >6 months after the last dose), ECOG PS 0-1, no 
evidence  of  pre-existing  uncontrolled  hypertension,  no  active  seizure  disorder  or  evidence  of  brain 
metastases, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis.

Patients  were  enrolled  beginning  on  15-JUN-2010  and  stratified  by  ECOG  status  (0  versus  1),  then 
randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either axitinib (5 mg BID; N=192) or sorafenib (400 mg BID; N=96). 
Participants continued to receive study treatment until documented PD, unacceptable AEs, or any of the 
other  discontinuation  criteria  were  met,  as  outlined  in  the  protocol.  Participants  with  PD  who  were 
experiencing  a  clinical  benefit  with  either  axitinib  or  sorafenib  were  eligible  for  continued  treatment 
provided  that  the  treating  physician  had  assessed  the  risk/benefit  of  taking  such  an  approach  and 
provided that the sum of longest diameters of measurable lesions remained less than or equal to the 
baseline sum of longest diameters and no alternative treatment was available. 
Participants were evaluated with radiographic imaging to assess response to treatment at baseline, after 
randomization at Week 6 and Week 12, then Q8W thereafter. All participants were followed for survival. 
The primary endpoint was PFS per RECIST 1.0 by central radiology assessment. Key secondary endpoints 
included OS, ORR, and DOR. 
A total of 148 patients with progressive disease or death were required for a log-rank test with an overall 
1-sided significance level of 0.025 to have power of 0.90. This assumed a 78% improvement in median 
PFS from 5.5 months to 9.8 months in treatment-naïve mRCC patients randomized to receive axitinib. 
Applying  a  2:1  randomization  and  a  planned  accrual  period  of  16  months,  a  follow-up  period  of 
approximately 6 months, and assuming 20% of patients dropped out at 24 months in each arm, it was 
estimated that approximately 247 patients needed to be enrolled in order to observe 148 patients with 
progressive disease or death by the end of the follow-up period. The nominal significance level for the 
interim  and  final  efficacy  analyses  was  determined  using  the  Lan-DeMets  procedure  with  an 
O’Brien-Fleming  stopping  rule.  The  final  analysis  was  to  take  place  when  the  148th  patient  had 
documented progressive disease or death. The overall Type I error rate was preserved at the nominal 
0.025 level. 
The sample size described above also allowed the assessment of differences in the secondary endpoint of 
OS with a high level of significance. Median OS in treatment-naïve mRCC patients treated with sorafenib 
was estimated to be 17.3 months. A total of 178 deaths were required for a log-rank test with an overall 
1-sided  significance  level  of  0.025  to  have  power  of  0.80.  This  assumed  an  approximately  59% 
improvement in median OS from 17 months to 27 months in mRCC patients who had received no prior 
systemic  therapy  randomized  to  receive  axitinib  and  a  follow-up  period  of  approximately  37  months, 
assuming a 0% drop out rate. The estimated sample size of 247 patients for PFS was also sufficient to 
observe the 178 deaths needed for comparing median OS.

Table: Overall Summary of Patient Disposition by Treatment 
In the first line portion of this study in treatment naïve patients with mRCC, the study did not achieve its 
primary  objective,  although  there  was  a  23.3%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  disease  progression  or  death 
(HR=0.767; 95% CI [0.559, 1.053]; p-value=0.0377) for axitinib vs sorafenib.

OS,  a  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  was  immature  at  the  time  of  the  final  PFS  analysis,  with  only 
approximately 40% of patients having died. The currently estimated survival probability at 12 months 
was 72.0% (95% CI [65.0%, 77.9%]) for axitinib and 73.5% (95% CI [63.4%, 81.2%]) for sorafenib. 
The observed HR was 1.136 (95% CI [0.765, 1.687]) with a 1-sided p-value of 0.7370. 
ORR, a secondary endpoint was superior for axitinib compared to sorafenib (ORR of 32.3% and 14.6%, 
respectively, the risk ratio (axitinib:sorafenib) was 2.214 (95% CI [1.306, 3.753]) with a 1-sided p-value 
of 0.0006. DoR, a secondary efficacy endpoint, was similar between treatments; the median DoR was 
14.7 and 14.3 months for axitinib and sorafenib, respectively. 
 “Summary table of the contribution of each component in the combination regimen”: 
Comparison and analyses of results across studies 
A  comparison  of  the  results  from  KEYNOTE-427  and  Study  A4061051  with  KEYNOTE-426  has  been 
presented by the MAH to provide the contribution of each component of the combination regimen to the 
overall efficacy of pembrolizumab + axitinib for the 1L treatment of advanced RCC. 
Study design 
The separate studies, KEYNOTE-426, KEYNOTE-427 Cohort A (ccRCC), and Study A4061051, were similar 
in  terms  of  criteria  defining  the  eligible  participant  population.  The  following  differences  were  also 
notable: 
•  KEYNOTE-426  and  KEYNOTE-427  enrolled  participants  with  KPS  ≥70%,  which  is  similar  to  an 
ECOG  performance  status  of  0  to  2.  Study  A4061051  enrolled  participants  with  an  ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1. 
•  Stratification to study intervention was based on IMDC risk category and geographical region in 
KEYNOTE-426  and  ECOG  performance  status  in  Study  A4061051.  Because  KEYNOTE-427  is  a 
single arm study, no stratification was applicable, although outcomes were analyzed by IMDC risk 
category. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 81/193 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Randomization  to  study  intervention  was  1:1  in  KEYNOTE-426  and  2:1  in  Study  A4061051. 
Eligible participants with ccRCC were allocated to Cohort A of KEYNOTE-427. 
•  KEYNOTE-427  was  single-arm  study  and  used  ORR  per  RECIST  1.1  by  BICR  as  the  primary 
endpoint. 
• 
In KEYNOTE-426 and KEYNOTE-427, participants were evaluated with radiographic imaging at 
baseline, after randomization at Week 12, then Q6W until Week 54, and Q12W thereafter. In 
Study  A4061051,  participants  were  evaluated  with  radiographic  imaging  at  baseline,  after 
randomization at Week 6 and Week 12, then Q8W thereafter.

Efficacy summary of all studies 
KEYNOTE-427  and  Study  A4061051  demonstrate  the  individual  contributions  of  pembrolizumab  and 
axitinib relative to that of the combination. Cohort A (ccRCC) of KEYNOTE-427 was specifically designed 
to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  to  support  the  development  of 
pembrolizumab  +  axitinib  in  KEYNOTE-426.  Study  A4061051  was  a  multicenter,  randomized  Phase  3 
study of axitinib monotherapy versus sorafenib monotherapy conducted in a similar patient population as 
that of KEYNOTE-426. 
Pembrolizumab and axitinib both demonstrated clinical activity in advanced RCC in KEYNOTE-427 and 
Study A4061051, respectively. The ORR and PFS results of pembrolizumab + axitinib in KEYNOTE-426 
were markedly greater (in some cases doubled) relative to what was observed in either KEYNOTE-427 or 
Study A4061051 [Table 2.7.3-rcc1: 12]. Even acknowledging that these are cross-study comparisons, 
the MAH claims that the results from the combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib in KEYNOTE-426 
represent  substantial  improvements  in  ORR  and  PFS  relative  to  either  component  administered  as 
monotherapy as shown by non-overlapping 95% CIs. These data demonstrate the contribution of each of 
the components to the efficacy of the pembrolizumab and axitinib combination regimen.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
A  type  II  Variation  for  the  extension  of  Keytruda  therapeutic  indication  for  the  first-line  treatment  of 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in adults in combination with axitinib has been submitted by the 
MAH based on the IA1 results of the pivotal phase III trial KEYNOTE-426. Updated data with cut-off date 
of 2 Jan 2019 have been further submitted upon CHMP request. 
Data from KEYNOTE-427 (Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants with RCC) for 
participants with clear cell RCC (Cohort A), and the Pfizer-sponsored Study A4061051 (Phase 3 study of 
axitinib versus sorafenib) have been submitted as supportive with the aim to provide the contribution of 
each of the components to the efficacy of the pembrolizumab + axitinib regimen.  
The  results  of  the  Pfizer  sponsored  study  KEYNOTE-035/A4061079  (Phase  1b  of  pembrolizumab  + 
axitinib in RCC), which provided the rationale for evaluating pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib 
in participants with advanced RCC, have been also submitted. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study KEYNOTE-426 
KEYNOTE-426 is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, 2 arms, open-label 
clinical  study  in  first  line  adult  patients  with  advanced  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC),  comparing  the 
combination of pembrolizumab 200mg Q3W + axitinib 5 mg BID with sunitinib 50 mg QD 4 weeks n 2 
weeks off. 
Adult patients with newly diagnosed stage IV per AJCC (locally advanced/metastatic disease) or recurrent 
histologically  confirmed  RCC  with  clear  cell  component  (with  or  without  sarcomatoid  features)  were 
eligible  provided  they  had  not  received  prior  systemic  therapy  for  advanced  renal  cancer  (prior 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy for RCC was acceptable if completed >12 months prior to randomization). 
Due to the small sample size in both treatment groups and the limited number of events at the time of the 
data cutoff, a meaningful  analysis of OS and PFS in participants with sarcomatoid features cannot be 
performed at this time. Nevertheless results seem to be consistent with the ITT population. 
Patients with non-clear cell RCC were not included in the trial, even though they are not excluded by the 
sought indication. This is not rejected in principle. To support the activity of pembrolizumab and axitinib 
in  non-clear  cell  RCC,  the  MAH  provided  data  from  KN-427  cohort  B  for  pembrolizumab,  and  shortly 
discussed the results of a multicenter phase II trial of axitinib in patients with recurrent or metastatic 
nccRCC who had failed prior treatment with temsirolimus (Park, 2018) arguing that these data support 
the activity of axitinib in nccRCC.  Overall, it is considered that there is some evidence supporting the 
potential activity of both pembrolizumab and axitinib as single agents in nccRCC. No combination data are 
available. In the SmPC it has been added that patients enrolled in KN-426 trial have clear cell component.   
Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 expression. This is not questioned, taking into account that 
responses had been observed in both PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative patients in the phase Ib study 
KN-035 with the combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib, and also in the phase II study KN-427 with 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  (although  more  pronounced  in  PD-L1  CPS  ≥ 1).  Subgroup  analyses 
according to PD-L1 expression have been included in the protocol.    
There was no restriction based on IMDC risk category: this is acceptable, although the heterogeneity of 
the patient population in terms of prognosis is noted. This was considered as a stratification factor.

Patients should have KPS ≥70% and disease was to be measurable. Other key eligibility criteria to account 
for the known safety profile of pembrolizumab, axitinib and sunitinib. 
Sunitinib  is  considered  an  acceptable  comparator  in  the  target  population  of  this  study,  and  is 
administered at the recommended dose for RCC (Sutent SmPC). 
With regard to the experimental arm, the main issue is related to the assessment of the contribution of 
each component of the combination treatment. According the Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer 
medicinal  products  in  man  (EMA/CHMP/205/95  Rev.5),  when  a  new  combination  is  tested  against  a 
reference  regimen,  clinical  phase  I/II  data  should  support  the  need  for  both  components  in  the 
experimental regimen. The documented activity of the individual components of the combination regimen 
should  be  taken  into  account,  and  if  one  of  the  components  is  regarded  as  an  acceptable  treatment 
regimen in monotherapy, a randomised phase II study comparing the monotherapy regimen with the 
combination should be considered. This is deemed important since the combination regimen is expected 
to  be  more  toxic  compared  to  monotherapy  with  each  of  the  components.  The  study  design  of 
KEYNOTE-426 (with different TKIs in the control and comparator arm) does not allow to evaluate the 
contribution of the TKI axitinib to the superiority of the combination therapy compared to sunitib. Axitinib 
could be regarded as comparable to sunitinib with regard to efficacy, but a recent real-world analysis 
showed that compared with sunitinib, axitinib significantly prolonged OS (Konishi et al. Med Oncol 2018). 
In other words, the efficacy benefit for the combination could be attributed in part to a higher level of 
activity with axitinib than with sunitinib, this should be considered. 
It is acknowledged that efficacy results from Study KN-035 showed high activity of the combination, with 
confirmed  ORR  of  73.1%  (95%  CI  [59.0,  84.4])  that  compares  favourably  with  observed  ORR  with 
axitinib  (32.3%;  95%  CI  25.7,  39.4)  and  pembrolizumab  (36.4;  95%  CI  27.4,  46.1%)    in  separate 
studies (Study A4061061 and Study KN-427). However, no direct comparison has been performed. This 
is  particularly  relevant  for  pembrolizumab,  since  for  immunotherapies  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  clear 
correlation  between  ORR  and  long  term  benefit,  and  conventional  response  evaluation  criteria  may 
underestimate the long-term benefit from immunotherapies (Anagnostou V et al. Clin Cancer Res 2017, 
Hodi F et al. J Clin Oncol 2016, Kaufman H et al. J Clin Oncol 2017). Furthermore, it cannot be excluded 
that pembrolizumab monotherapy could represent a valid treatment option for at least a subgroup of 
patients  (e.g.  high  PD-L1  expression).  In  this  regard,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  justify  the  lack  of  a 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  arm  based  on  all  available  nonclinical  and  clinical  data.  The  MAH  has 
provided  comparative  efficacy  data  of  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  axitinib  vs  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, according to PD-L1 status, from Study KEYNOTE-426 and Study KEYNOTE-427 Cohort A, 
respectively.  Besides the intrinsic limitations of such cross-study  comparison, it is acknowledged that 
data suggests that the combination is more efficacious than pembrolizumab as monotherapy in subjects 
with  PD-L1  CPS<1,  with  a  trend  (95%CI  overlapping)  suggesting  a  higher  benefit  even  in  the  CPS≥1 
subgroup in terms of ORR and PFS. Indeed, in the CPS≥1 subgroup ORR was 60.5% (95% CI 54.0, 66.7) 
and 44.2% 95%CI 30.5, 58.7) in the combination and monotherapy, respectively. Median PFS was 15.3 
(95% CI 12.6,-) and 9.7 (95%CI 6.7, 16.4). OS data are too immature. No definitive conclusion can be 
drawn due to the lack of a direct comparison between the combination and pembrolizumab monotherapy 
in subjects with high PD-L1 expression. However, it is acknowledged that the combination of these two 
agents with distinct mechanisms of action tend to provide a higher benefit in terms of ORR and PFS.  
The rationale for the proposed doses and schedule of the combination is adequately justified based on PK 
and clinical results of phase Ib Study KN-035 that demonstrated the safety and tolerability feasibility of 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/Kg Q3W plus axitinib 5 mg BID, and the integrated body of evidence suggesting 
that 200 mg Q3w is expected to provide similar response and exposures to that expected with the 2 
mg/Kg Q3W.

The open-label design is justified on the basis of the different route and schedule of administration of 
drugs in the two arms. In view of the risk of bias due to the open label-design, the assessment of response 
has been performed based on blinded independent central review (BICR).  
Participants were stratified according to International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk 
group  (favourable  versus  intermediate  versus  poor),  and  Geographic  region  (North  America  versus 
Western Europe versus “Rest of the World”). Stratification factors appear appropriate.  
The  primary  objectives  of  the  study  were  to  compare  the  OS  and  PFS  per  RECIST  1.1  by  BICR  in 
participants treated with pembrolizumab + axitinib vs sunitinib. ORR, DCR, DoR, safety and tolerability 
profile  of  pembrolizumab,  PFS  and  OS  rate  at  12,  24  and  18  months,  and  PROs  were  secondary 
objectives. The choice of OS and PFS as primary objectives can be considered appropriate. 
The expected median PFS time in the control group was 13 months. Based on 487 PFS events, the study 
had ~99% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.60 for PFS at alpha=0.2% (1-sided). The expected median 
OS time in the control group was 33 months. Based on 404 death events, the study had 80% power to 
detect  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.75  for  OS  at  alpha=2.3%  (1-sided).  The  sample  size  calculations  result 
congruent with the assumptions made. 
Efficacy analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The statistical methods 
used  for  time  to  events  and  binary  endpoints  are  considered  adequate.  Two  interim  analyses  were 
planned for OS and one for PFS. A group sequential approach was used to allocate alpha between the 
interim and final analyses. The IA1 (first interim analysis for PFS and OS) was planned after enrollment 
completion, when a minimum of 305 PFS events had accrued and all participants were followed for at 
least  7  months  after  randomization,  and  it  was  expected  to  be  22  months  after  the  first  subject 
randomized. Approximately 48% of the final required OS events (or 195 deaths) were expected at that 
time. The study met its primary endpoints at IA1. The approaches, to control Type I error is appropriate.  
A total of 1062 participants were screened (first participant screened on 06-OCT-2016) and 861 were 
randomly  allocated  from  24-OCT-2016  to  24-JAN-2018  across  124 global  study  sites  in  16  countries. 
Screen failure was mostly due to not meeting specific eligibility criteria. No new concern arises regarding 
the conduction of the study. 
Important  protocol  deviations  were  reported  in  a  similar  rate  in  the  2  groups  (14.2%  in  the 
pembrolizumab + axitinib group and 12.9% in the sunitinib group), and it is considered unlikely that they 
impacted on the results.  
Overall,  there  were  no  meaningful  imbalances  in  patients’  baseline  characteristics  among  treatment 
arms, and the enrolled population is overall representative of real life EU patients. In the experimental 
arm there were few more women (28.7% vs 25.4%) and subjects aged ≥ 65 years (39.8% vs 35.2%) and 
less subjects with ≥ 2 organs involved with disease at baseline (72.9% vs 77.2%) than in the control arm. 
The percentage of participants in the IMDC risk categories of favorable, intermediate, and poor risk was 
31.2%,  56.2%  and  12.5%,  respectively.  A  total  of  57.7%  of  participants  had  a  tumor  tissue  PD-L1 
expression score of CPS ≥1.  
The supportive trial Keynote 427 is a phase 2, open-label trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab as 1L treatment for advanced ccRCC (Cohort A) and nccRCC 
(Cohort B). Data from Cohort A which included 110 patients are supportive of the present submission. 
Data up to the DBL of 07-Sep-2018 including a medium follow-up of 18 months are presented. No mature 
OS  data  was  available  and  an  update  should  be  provided  (OC).  In  Keynote  427,  the  PD-L1  positive 
subgroup was constituted by 52 (53.7%) out of the 110 randomised subjects. The OS rates at 3 months, 
6 months, and 12 months were 97.3%, 92.7%, and 88.2%, respectively.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results submitted by the MAH are based on the pre-planned IA1 for PFS and OS (0.75 information 
fraction to PFS and 0.48 information fraction to OS) with a data cut-off date 24-AUG-2018. The median 
duration of follow up was 13.2 months (range: 0.1 to 21.5 months) in the pembrolizumab + axitinib group 
and  12.1  months  (range:  0.4  to  22.0  months)  in  the  sunitinib  group.  As  per  CHMP  request,  updated 
efficacy  data  with  cut-off  date  2  Jan  2019  have  been  submitted,  with  an  additional  4.3  months  of 
follow-up  compared  to  the  IA1.  The  median  follow  up  is  now  17.4  months  and  15.7  months  in  the 
experimental arm and in the control arm, respectively. 
The ITT population included 432 patients randomized to pembro combo and 429 to sunitinib. 
Primary endpoints 
A statistically significant benefit in OS has been observed for pembrolizumab + axitinib over sunitinib (HR 
of 0.53, 95% CI 0.38, 0.74; p=0.00005) with 59 (13.7%) and 97 (22.6%) events in the experimental and 
the control arm, respectively. The median OS for both arms was not reached. The estimated percentage 
of  patients  who  were  alive  at  12  months  was  89.9%  (95%  CI,  86.4  to  92.4)  in  the  pembrolizumab–
axitinib group and 78.3% (95% CI, 73.8 to 82.1) in the sunitinib group. The corresponding estimates for 
18 months were 82.3% (95% CI, 77.2 to 86.3) and 72.1% (95% CI, 66.3 to 77.0). Data are considered 
rather immature, with an OS event rate of 13.7% and 22.6% for the combination and sunitinib arm. The 
amount  of  censoring  was  high  in  the  tail  of  the  K-M  curves,  starting  at  month  7.  In  order  to  have 
estimations regarding OS more precise, updated OS data were requested. Since a statistically significant 
improvement had been demonstrated at IA1, only descriptive OS and PFS data, not formally tested for 
statistical significance, were provided. Overall, 50 additional OS events (25 in each arm) were observed. 
A clear benefit is still observed in the overall population as well as in the IMDC poor (HR= 0.50, 95%CI 
0.29, 0.87) and intermediate (HR= 0.52, 95%CI 0.36,0.75) risk categories. With a total of 25 OS events 
(13  and  12  in  the  experimental  and  control  arm,  respectively),  it  is  not  possible  to  draw  any  sound 
conclusion with regard to the IMDC favourable risk group (HR 0.94, 95%CI 0.43, 2.07). The OS KM curves 
in this subgroup are, as expected, superimposable at this stage.  
Overall,  OS  subgroup  analyses  show  results  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis,  although  very  few 
events are observed in specific subgroups such as in the favourable IMDC risk group. 
A  statistically  significant  benefit  in  PFS  has  been  also  observed  for  pembrolizumab  +  axitinib  over 
sunitinib (HR of 0.69, 95% CI 0.56, 0.84; p=0.00014) with 183 (42.4%) and 213 (49.7%) events in the 
experimental and the control arm, respectively. The median PFS is 15.1 (95% CI 12.6, 17.7) and 11.0 
(95% CI 8.7, 12.5) in the experimental and the control arm, respectively. The KM curves tend to separate 
quite  early  and  tend  to  remain  parallel over  time.  The  censoring  due  to≥  2  missing  assessment/New 
Anticancer Therapy/No Post-Baseline Assessment are much more frequent in the control arm (14.8%) 
than in the experimental arm (7%). PFS sensitivity analysis based on different censoring rules show a 
consistent effect. In the updated PFS data, a total of 43 additional PFS events (24 in the experimental arm 
and 19 in the control arm) were reported. As observed for OS, a clear benefit in terms of PFS is also 
observed in the ITT population (HR 0.69, 95%CI 0.57, 0.83), as well as in the IMDC poor (HR= 0.57, 
95%CI 0.35, 0.92) and intermediate (HR= 0.70, 95%CI 0.55,0.90) risk categories. With 13 additional 
PFS events observed in the IMDC favourable risk group (now occurred in 103/269 patients, i.e. 38.2% of 
the subjects with baseline favourable IMDC risk) the HR is 0.73 (95% CI 0.49, 1.09) slightly improved 
compared to the previous report (HR 0.81, 95%CI 0.53, 1.24). The PFS KM curves in this subgroup tend 
to separate after 7 months. 
Overall, PFS subgroup analyses show results consistent with the primary analysis, although a lower effect 
is observed in the favourable IMDC risk group and in subjects with CPS<1%.

Interestingly,  PFS  based  on  investigator  assessment  is  not  statistically  significant  with  an  HR  of  0.82 
(95% CI 0.67, 1.00) and a median PFS of 14.5 (95% CI 12.5, 17.7) and 11.9 (95% CI 10.1, 15.0) in the 
experimental and the control arm, respectively. The concordance between Investigator and BICR, show 
an overall agreement around 80%. Compared to Investigator BICR assigned PD at a later time in 13% 
and 8% for the experimental arm and the control arm, but disagreed in 20% and 25%. Among subjects 
with no PD based on Investigators' Assessment, BICR detected much more frequently in the control arm 
(22%) than in the experimental arm (11%). This substantial discrepancy is somewhat unexpected and 
raises concern with regard to the robustness of the results. 
Objective response rate based on BICR assessment were observed in 59.3% (95% CI 54.5,63.9) of the 
patients treated with the combination compared to 35.7% (95% CI 31.1,40.4) in the control arm. The 
median time to response is similar in the two arms, while the duration of response tend to be longer in the 
experimental arm with 70.6% of patients still in response at 12 months in the control arm vs 61.6% in the 
control  arm.  At  the  updated  analysis,  with  only  15  more  objective  responses  reported  (3  in  the 
experimental arm and 12 in the control arm), results are very similar to those reported at the IA1. The 
ORR difference of 20.71% (95% CI 9.00, 31.90) in the IMDC favourable risk group, quite consistent with 
other IMDC risk subgroups, is noted. 
With regard to PROs, Time to true deterioration in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Kidney 
Symptom Index - Disease related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) differed between the two arms with a worse 
outcome for the experimental arm (HR 1.44; 95% CI 1.14, 1.82; nominal p:0.999). A worsening from 
baseline to Week 30 was observed for diarrhea in the EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom scale. 
Contribution of each component in the combination regimen. 
The absence of a well designed clinical trial testing the combination and monotherapies (pembrolizumab 
and axitinib) leads to uncertainties when it comes to reaching a benefit risk conclusion. Beneficial result 
of  the  comparison  of  pembrolizumab  +  axitinib  versus  sunitinib  can  be  reasoned  by  each  of  the  two 
components. It could be possible that the whole treatment effect might be reasoned by axitinib without an 
additional effect of pembrolizumab or vice versa. Pembrolizumab and axitinib are two different drugs with 
different  action  and  independent  activities.  The  applicant  provides  the  supportive  phase  3  study 
A4061051, where 288 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either axitinib or sorafenib. The 
confirmed  ORR  for  pembrolizumab  +  axitinib  in  KEYNOTE-426  (60.0%  [55.2,  64.6])  from  the 
02-JAN-2019 cutoff was   higher relative to what was observed for axitinib in Study A4061051 (32.3% 
[95% CI: 25.7, 39.4]) (Table 24). This was also the case for the median PFS (17.1 months [13.6, 18.9] 
vs.  10.1  months  [95%  CI:  7.2,  12.1],  respectively).  The  median  OS  was  still  not  reached  with  the 
updated data for KEYNOTE-426 in comparison to 21.7 months (95% CI: 18.0, 31.7) for axitinib in Study 
A4061051. The observed OS rate at 12 months in the pembrolizumab + axitinib group continued to be 
higher relative to what was observed for axitinib in Study A4061051 (89.5% versus 72.0%). 
In addition, the applicant provides the supportive phase 2 Keynote-427, where 110 patients with ccRCC 
were  included  in  a  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  cohort  A.  The  results  for  the  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy arm of this study showed an ORR of 36.4 % (95%CI: (27.4, 46.1)), a median PFS of 7.1 
months (95%CI: (5.6, 11.0)) and an OS rate at 12 month of 88.2%.  
Considering  the  ORR  and  PFS  data  described  in  the  supportive  studies,  these  results  support  the 
hypothesis that each component is contributing to the treatment effect in the combination regimen, ORR 
and PFS results of both monotherapies were lower compared to the results of the combination therapy. 
However,  no  meaningful  differences  could  be  observed  between  the  preliminary  OS  data  for 
pembrolizumab monotherapy, axitinib monotherapy and the combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib. 
Even  if  acknowledging  the  differences  in  comparing  OS  data  across  different  trials,  there  remains  an 
uncertainty whether both components would be needed in the 1L treatment of RCC.

Analyses of efficacy endpoints according to PD-L1 expression: 
Results in terms of OS for patients with PD-L1 CPS≥1% showed a median not reached at the time of the 
analysis (HR: 0.54 (95%CI: 0.35, 0.84). For patients with PD-L1<1 no medians were reached in either 
study arm, too (HR: 0.59 (95%CI: 0.34, 1.03). Superior efficacy of pembrolizumab+ axitinib combination 
over sunitinib therapy has been observed regardless PD-L1 expression.  
Favourable risk patients 
Efficacy regarding OS benefit is demonstrated for the overall study population based on the first IA with 
a median follow-up of 13.2 months. OS data are too immature to support efficacy in the favourable risk 
group which comprises 1/3 of the ITT population (with only 7 events in the pembrolizumab+ axitinib vs. 
10 events in the sunitinib group, observed so far).  
The  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  updated  efficacy  data  to  justify  the  use  this  combination  in  the 
proposed  patient  population.  Updated  OS  data  do  not  provide  any  additional  information.  Differently, 
updated PFS data show a trend to an improved effect in the IDMC favourable risk subgroup compared to 
data initially submitted. Overall, based on the updated data it can be agreed that a benefit in terms of PFS 
and  ORR  is  observed  across  all  IMDC  risk  group,  including  the  favourable.  There  is  no  apparent 
detrimental effect in terms of OS in the IMDC favourable risk subgroup, although also updated data are 
quite immature. It is reassuring that most of the patients (11/15, 73%) who discontinued treatment with 
pembrolizumab and axitinib due to hepatic AEs received subsequent anti-cancer treatment, which is even 
higher than the rate of patients (88/176, 50%) who received a subsequent anti-cancer treatment therapy 
after discontinuing pembrolizumab + axitinib for any reason. Unfortunately, PFS2 data does not seem to 
have been captured. Taking into account the clearly worse safety profile of the combination, in order to 
provide further reassurance, the MAH was asked to provide comparative data on the ability to receive 
subsequent  anticancer  therapy  in  all  subjects  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  any  AEs  in  the  two 
arms. While the rate in the two arms appears to be similar (65/429 [15.2%] and 61/425 [14.4%] in the 
pembrolizumab plus axitinib arm and the sunitinib arm, respectively), less subjects in the experimental 
arm received subsequent systemic treatments (24/65 [36.9%] and 30/61 [49.2%] in the pembrolizumab 
plus axitinib arm and the sunitinib arm, respectively). Looking at those patients who received subsequent 
systemic treatments, it seems that treatment with pembrolizumab and axitinib does not negatively affect 
the  outcome  or  the  ability  to  tolerate  subsequent  treatment:  indeed,  treatment  duration  of  the  first 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy tended to be longer for patients in the experimental arm compared to the 
control arm, and no relevant differences were observed between the two arms in terms of reason for 
discontinuation  of  the  first  subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  with  the  exception  of  discontinuation  for 
toxicity  that  were  less  frequently  observed  in  the  experimental  arm  (4/24)  than  in  the  control  arm 
(10/28). Looking at those patients who discontinued study treatment(s) due to an AE and received no 
further anti-cancer treatments, the rate of patients still alive at the data cutoff of the submitted analysis 
(02 JAN 2019) was higher in the experimental arm (24/41, corresponding to 58.5%) compared to the 
sunitinib arm (13/31 corresponding to 41.9%). 
Special populations  
The benefit of pembrolizumab + axitinib over sunitinib was seen across the age subgroups: <65 years 
and ≥65 years.   
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib demonstrated superiority vs sunitinib in terms of PFS and 
OS in patients with advanced RCC, supported by an advantage in terms of ORR. The lack of monotherapy 
experimental arms in study KN-426 hampers the assessment of the contribution of each component of 
the combination treatment. Even though exploratory data show higher ORR with the combination 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 90/193 
 
 
 
compared to both pembrolizumab and axitinib, only indirect comparisons are available. This is particularly 
relevant for pembrolizumab, since conventional response evaluation criteria may underestimate the 
long-term benefit and it cannot be excluded that pembrolizumab monotherapy could represent a valid 
treatment option for at least a subgroup of patients (e.g. high PD-L1 expression).  Overall, based on the 
updated data, a benefit in terms of PFS and ORR is observed across all IMDC risk group, including the 
favourable. Additionally, there is no apparent detrimental effect in terms of OS in the IMDC favourable 
risk subgroup, although data are quite immature.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to clinical efficacy: the final 
CSR of the pivotal Keynote-426 study is to be provided post-approval as Annex II condition, in particular 
to further characterize the benefit of the combination treatment in the favourable IDMC risk group based 
on data with longer follow-up. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evaluation provided to support the claimed indication of pembrolizumab in combination with 
axitinib  (Inlyta®,  AG-013736)  for  1L  treatment  of  subjects  with  advanced  RCC  is  based  on  the  first 
interim analysis (IA1) of the KEYNOTE-426 study. This is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, 
multicenter, global study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pembrolizumab+Axitinib versus Sunitinib 
for the 1L treatment for advanced RCC with clear cell component. Participants were stratified by IMDC risk 
category and geographic region and then randomized in a 1:1 ratio between treatment arms. IA1 was a 
combined event- and time-driven analysis with data cut-off date 24-AUG-2018 and a median duration of 
follow-up of 12.8 months [range: 0.1, 22.0].  
Provided safety summary tables including all subjects as treated (ASaT) population show side-by-side 
safety results of the following four datasets: 
•  KEYNOTE-426 Pembrolizumab plus Axitinib Safety Dataset (N = 429) 
•  KEYNOTE-426 Sunitinib Safety Dataset (N = 425) 
•  Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset (N = 4439): to enable a comparison of safety 
data  from  KEYNOTE  426  with  the  established  safety  profile  for  pembrolizumab  monotherapy.  It 
included all subjects who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-001 Part B1, B2, 
B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3, KEYNOTE-002 (original phase), KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-010, KEYNOTE-012 
Cohorts  B  and  B2,  KEYNOTE-013  Cohort  3,  KEYNOTE-024,  KEYNOTE-040,  KEYNOTE-045, 
KEYNOTE-052, KEYNOTE-055 and KEYNOTE-087. 
•  Cumulative Running Safety Dataset for Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (N = 6436): to evaluate the 
consistency of the pembrolizumab safety profile across indications. It included safety data collected 
as of the data cut-off (07-SEP-2018) for KEYNOTE-427 Cohort A (RCC monotherapy) and participants 
treated  with  pembrolizumab  from  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD  and  studies  previously 
submitted for review in the following indications: KEYNOTE-001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3; 
KEYNOTE-002 (original phase); KEYNOTE-006; KEYNOTE-010; KEYNOTE-012 Cohort B and B2 (head 
and  neck  cancer),  Cohort C  (urothelial  tract  cancer  cancer),  and  Cohort D  (gastric  cancer); 
KEYNOTE-013  Cohort 3  (classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma)  and  Cohort  4a  (primary  mediastinal  large 
B-cell  lymphoma);  KEYNOTE-017;  KEYNOTE-024,  KEYNOTE-028  Cohort B4;  KEYNOTE-040; 
KEYNOTE-042; KEYNOTE-045 and KEYNOTE-052 (urothelial cancer); KEYNOTE-054; KEYNOTE-055,

Additional supportive safety data is provided to understand the contribution of each drug to the safety 
profile of the combination in the claimed indication:  
•  Axitinib monotherapy arm: data from the Pfizer-Sponsored, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, 
multicenter Study A4061051 (Axitinib vs Sorafenib study) for the 1L treatment of metastatic RCC 
(data cut-off date 27 July 2012; N = 189)  
• 
Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  Cohort  A  of  the  ongoing,  Phase  2,  nonrandomized,  open-label, 
2-cohort, multicenter, global KEYNOTE-427 study for the 1L treatment of advanced ccRCC (data 
cut-off date 07 Sept 2018; N =110) 
The  safety  data  from  the  52 participants  enrolled  in  the  Phase  1b  study  (Study  A4061079)  of 
pembrolizumab+axitinib  were  not  pooled  with  KEYNOTE-426  for  this  summary  and  are  presented 
separately in the dossier.

Demographic and other baseline characteristics  
With  regards  to  disease  characteristics  (KPS,  IMDC  Risk  Category,  PD-L1  Status,  Sites  of  Metastatic 
Disease, Number of Organs Involved, Recurrent/Newly Diagnosed, RCC Stage), treatment arms of the 
KEYNOTE-426 study were well balanced. Liver metastases were found in approximately 15% of subjects 
of both treatment arms. In both treatment arms, most subjects (approximately 83%) had undergone 
prior nephrectomy and only a small proportion (approximately 9%) had received prior radiation therapy.

When adjusted for exposure, the overall event rate of SAEs was similar for pembrolizumab+axitinib (6.0 
events/100  person-months)  compared  with  sunitinib  (5.1  events/100  person-months);  however 
differences with higher rates for pembrolizumab+axitinib vs. sunitinib remained for diarrhoea (0.3 vs. 
0.1), hepatobiliary disorders (0.4 vs. 0.2), investigations (0.4 vs. 0.1 mainly due to increase of ALT, AST, 
blood  bilirubin,  hepatic  enzyme,  liver  function  test  and  transaminases  increased),  musculoskeletal 
disorders (0.3 vs. 0.1), nervous system disorders (0.4. vs. 0.2), and renal and urinary disorders (0.4 vs. 
0.2 events/100 person-months). 
Rates of exposure-adjusted SAEs were highest in the first three months (10 events/100 person-months 
in  both 
treatment  arms)  and 
then  decreased  subsequently  (with  higher  rates 
in 
the 
pembrolizumab+axitinib arm from 3 months onwards).

Narratives were provided for all the 11 subjects with AEs leading to death up to 90 days after last dose 
that occurred in the pembrolizumab-axitinib arm of KN426. Based on the information provided (data not

(Grade 4 in 1 case, Grade 3 in 4 cases and Grade 1 in the remaining case).    
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AEOSI are categories comprised of groups of PTs developed by the Sponsor during the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy program to assess the frequency of immune-related events considered by the Sponsor to 
be  causally  related  to  pembrolizumab.  Each  AEOSI  represents  a  single  medical  concept  (e.g., 
immune-related  hypothyroidism)  and  is  comprised  of  multiple  PTs  (hypothyroidism,  hypothyroidism, 
myxoedema, myxoedema coma, primary hypothyroidism). When pembrolizumab is combined with other 
drugs, the other drug(s) in the combination may have an AE profile whose ADRs overlap with particular 
PTs contained in 1 or more AEOSI categories (e.g., axitinib is causally associated with hypothyroidism). 
Under  these  circumstances,  those  AEs  reported  using  these  overlapping  PTs  may  not  always  be 
immune-mediated. Furthermore, an active control (eg, sunitinib) may have an AE profile that includes 
ADRs whose PTs overlap with PTs contained in 1 or more AEOSI categories. Unless the control drug(s) are 
immunomodulatory  agents,  these  ADRs,  although  reported  using  PTs  that  overlap  with  some  PTs 
contained in the AEOSI categories, are not immune-related.

In the pembrolizub+axitinib arm, median time to Pneumonitis AEOSI was 199 days (range, 126-527). An 
average of 1 episode was reported per patient with a median duration of 91 days. Corticosteroids were 
given at high doses in 58.3% and low doses in 16.7%.

In the pembrolizub+axitinib arm, median time to Thyroiditis AEOSI was 61 days (range, 22-224). An 
average of 1 episode was reported per patient with a not reached median duration (range, 22-508+). 
None of the subjects presenting with thyroiditis in either treatment arms received corticosteroids. 
Hepatic Adverse Events 
A higher than expected incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hepatic AEs was observed during the conduct of this 
study  via  medical  monitoring  and  was  confirmed  at  IA1.  In  order  to  better  understand 
treatment-emergent  hepatic  events,  a  formal  analysis  plan  was  developed  to  accurately  quantify  and 
characterize these events. A combined list of preferred AE terms from 3 MedDRA hepatic SMQs and the 
hepatitis AEOSI were predefined as hepatic AEs in the Hepatic Events Analysis Plan in the sSAP. A Hepatic 
Events Analysis Set (HEAS) was identified to include any participant who had received at least 1 dose of 
study  treatment  and  experienced  any  treatment-emergent  AE  matching  a  hepatic  AE  PT  from  the 
pre-selected list. 
Demography and Baseline Disease Characteristics of the HEAS 
A total of 287 participants (174 in the pembrolizumab+axitinib group, 113 in the sunitinib arm) were 
included  in  the  HEAS.  Participant  demographics  were  generally  similar  to  those  reported  for  the  ITT 
population. Comparison between study arms shows comparable characteristics, except for proportion of 
subjects aged >65 years (pembrolizumab+axitinib 44.3%, sunitinib 31.9%). Also, disease characteristics 
were comparable in the two treatment arms. Liver metastases were described in 15.5% and 14.2% of 
subjects treated with pembrolizumab+axitinib and sunitinib, respectively. Subject characteristics in the 
pembrolizumab+axitinib arm were generally similar for the HEAS population (n=174) compared to those 
reported for the non-HEAS population (n=255); however a slightly higher proportion of Asian population 
was reported for the HEAS (19.5%) compared to the non-HEAS population (12.5%); the proportion of

 Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
 A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the 
columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding. 
 MedDRA preferred terms "Neoplasm progression", "Malignant neoplasm progression" and "Disease progression" not 
related to the drug are excluded. 
 The adverse events are ordered decreasingly by the incidence in the first column.

 Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
 A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the 
columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding. 
 Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are 
included. 
 The adverse events are ordered decreasingly by the incidence in the first column.

Overall, 15 participants discontinued both pembrolizumab + axitinib due to hepatic AEs; 11 (73.3%) of 
these participants received subsequent anti-cancer treatment, with a median interval from last dose of 
study treatment to first dose of subsequent treatment of 44 days (range 29 days to 252 days); 9 of these 
participants were alive at the time of data cutoff (02-JAN-2019). In context, 88 of 176 (50%) of 
participants who discontinued pembrolizumab + axitinib for any reason received a subsequent 
anti-cancer treatment therapy. Four participants who discontinued pembrolizumab + axitinib due to 
hepatic AEs did not receive subsequent anti-cancer treatments. Of those, 3 participants were alive at the 
time of data cutoff.

In  comparison  of  the  sunitinib  arm,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  abnormal  laboratory  findings  was 
higher in the pembrolizumab+axitinib arm for: ALT increased (59.6% vs 44.4%; grade 3-4 20.1% vs 
5.5%), AST increased (56.7% and 55.6%; grade 3-4 13.2% vs 4.5%), Bilirubin increased (22.0% vs 
21.1%), Calcium increased (26.6% vs 15.3%). While similar proportions across study arms were found 
for and Creatinine increased (43% and 40%), sunitinib-treated participants had lower frequency of the 
following: Potassium increased (34.1% vs 22%), Hemoglobin decreased (28.7% vs 65.3%; grade 3-4 
8.9%  vs  3.2%),  Leukocytes  decreased  (13.9%  vs  71.8%;  grade  3-4  1.4%  vs  7.8%),  Neutrophils 
decreased (26.6% vs 49%; 1.2% vs 18.8%), Phosphate decreased (26.2% vs 77.7%; grade 3-4 6.4% vs

ALT≥5xULN during the First Event (HEAS Population from Pembrolizumab + Axitinib Arm) 
Specific Hepatic Events Subgroups in the Pembrolizumab + Axitinib Group 
As  specified  in  the  in  the  Hepatic  Events  Analysis  Plan  in  the  supplemental  Statistical  Analysis  Plan, 
narratives of the following subgroups of hepatic events have been medically reviewed:  
• Group A: Summary of Concurrent ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN and Total Bilirubin ≥2 x ULN 
15  of  the  429  (3.5%)  participants  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  axitinib  group  were  identified  with 
concurrent ALT >3 × ULN and total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN. Of these 15 participants, 5 participants were 
Assessment report

Page 148/193 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
identified  as  having  elevated  ALT  with  concurrent  hepatic  dysfunction.  Of  the  remaining  10 
participants,  4  participants  lacked  sufficient  information  to  determine  if  hepatic  dysfunction  was 
present; 4 participants had laboratory values that were not consistent with hepatic dysfunction (eg, 
elevated indirect bilirubin); and 2 participants were determined to have elevated ALT related to other 
causes (ie, acute cholecystitis, multi-organ failure following myocarditis).  
All  but  two  participants  with  hepatic  AEs  recovered  to  Grade  1  or  Grade  0  (1  participant  with 
concurrent hepatic dysfunction recovered from Grade 4 to Grade 3, but died subsequently due to 
drug-related  necrotizing  fasciitis;  1  participant  in  whom  hepatic  dysfunction  could  not  be  fully 
established, continued to increase after study treatment discontinuation. This participant died due to 
disease progression). 
• Group B: Summary of ALT ≥20 x ULN 
Overall, 13 participants (3.1%) from the pembrolizumab + axitinib group were identified with peak 
ALT ≥20 × ULN. Five participants had concurrent total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN, and are included in Group 
A. Of the remaining 8 cases, five had onset ALT ≥20 x ULN (Grade 4) and the remaining 3 participants 
had onset ALT ≥3 x ULN but <5 x ULN (Grade 2) and of these, 2 participants had ALT increased to ≥20 
x  ULN  after  rechallenge.  In  all  8  participants,  ALT  elevations  recovered  to  <3  ×  ULN  with 
corticosteroid use (n=6) or no corticosteroid use (n=2). 
•  Group C: Participants with Treatment-emergent ALT ≥3 x ULN Without Recovery to ALT <3 x ULN 
Seven participants with treatment-emergent ALT elevation ≥3 × ULN did not demonstrate recovery 
of ALT <3 × ULN at the time of data cutoff [Table 4.5.22].  
o  2 participants had concurrent ALT ≥3 x ULN, total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN, and peak ALT ≥20 x ULN. 
o  1  participant  had  ALT  elevation  that  decreased  from  Grade  4  to  low  Grade  3  after 
discontinuation of both study treatments and initiation of steroid treatment. This participant 
subsequently died due to drug-related necrotizing fasciitis. 
o  1 participant with elevated ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin continued to increase after study 
treatment discontinuation and steroid treatment. This participant subsequently died due to 
disease progression without further follow-up data 
o  5 participants had peak ALT ≥3 x ULN but <5 x ULN without concurrent total bilirubin elevation 
(Grad 2). 
o  3  participants  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  disease  progression  with  no  follow-up 
data at the 90 day cutoff for this lab data analysis. 
o  1 participant had onset of ALT elevation (Grade 2) 15 days prior to data cutoff and was still in 
study treatment and at the time of the cutoff was being followed for this event. 
o  1 participant with no follow-up ALT data provided died due to myasthenia gravis that was 
considered by the investigator to be related to treatment.

The pembrolizumab OASE is the largest source of unblinded aggregate (i.e. across indications) safety 
data from pembrolizumab monotherapy including all open-label, unmasked, or completed randomized 
study for which there has been a database lock on or before 31-Mar--2018 (n=9118). Pooled data from 
all studies using chemotherapy comparators (all cytotoxic treatments combined, N=1324) is provided in 
this response for context and comparison.  
The OASE database was queried to identify participants with AEs (including AE count and frequency) from 
the MedDRA sub-SMQ Cardiac arrhythmias (including bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food 
and DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. Drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 enzymes, and 
other metabolizing enzymes, are not expected to interfere with the metabolism of an IgG antibody. The 
IgG antibodies, in general, do not directly regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, other 
enzymes, or transporters involved in drug elimination. Therefore, no dedicated DDI studies have been 
performed. In addition, in vitro experiments and studies conducted in preclinical species have been shown 
to have limited value in predicting DDI potential in humans [Ref. 5.4: 03JJPS]. Therefore, no preclinical 
pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to assess the propensity of pembrolizumab to be a victim or 
perpetrator of pharmacokinetic DDIs. Similarly, the potential of a DDI between pembrolizumab and a TKI 
is expected to be low due to differences in metabolic pathways. 
Studies evaluating pharmacodynamics drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. 
However,  as  systemic  corticosteroids  may  be  used  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  to  ameliorate 
potential  side  effects,  the  potential  for  a  pharmacokinetic  DDI  with  pembrolizumab  as  a  victim  was 
assessed  as  part  of  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis.  No  relationship  was  observed  between 
prolonged  use  of  systemic  corticosteroids  and  pembrolizumab  exposure.  Systemic  corticosteroids,  or 
other  immunosuppressants,  can  be  used  during  pembrolizumab  treatment  to  treat  immune-related 
adverse reactions.

monotherapy  across  indications  approved  in  the  EU,  and  the  Cumulative  Running  Safety  Dataset  for 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (including all pembrolizumab monotherapy indications globally) is provided 
to  evaluate  consistency  of  the  pembrolizumab  safety  profile  across  indications.  Finally,  as  supportive 
safety  information  data  from  the  Axitinib  monotherapy  arm  of  Phase  3  Study A4061051  for  the  1L 
treatment of metastatic RCC (data cut-off 27 July 2012; N=189) and the Pembrolizumab monotherapy 
Cohort A of KEYNOTE-427 study for the 1L treatment of advanced ccRCC (data cut-off 07 Sept 2018; 
N=110) are presented. The safety data from the 52 participants enrolled in the Phase 1b study (Study 
A4061079)  of  pembrolizumab+axitinib  were  presented  separately  in  the  dossier.  Safety  data  from 
KEYNOTE-427  Cohort A  (subjects  treated  with  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  for  1L  treatment  of 
advanced  ccRCC)  has  been  provided  either  pooled  within  the  Cumulative  Running  Safety  Dataset  for 
Pembrolizumab  Monotherapy  (including  all  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  indications  globally)  or 
separately in the CSR P427V01MK3475.   
Demographics of KN426 study population depict mainly White (80%) subjects of male gender (70-75%) 
with mean age of 61 years. Two thirds of participants were enrolled outside the EU. Regarding previous 
RCC treatments approximately 83% had undergone prior nephrectomy and 9% previous radiotherapy, 
with similar proportions in study arms. With the exception of proportion of subjects aged >65, that was 
slightly increased  in  the  pembrolizumab+axitinib  group  if  compared  to  the  sunitinib  group  (40.1%  vs 
34.8%, respectively), patient demographics and disease characteristics were quite well balanced among 
the two KN426 treatment arms. In the experimental arm there were few more women (28.7% vs 25.4%) 
than in the control arm. Liver metastases were found in approximately 15% of subjects of both arms. In 
respect to the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD and as expected for RCC patients, KN426 participants 
were  more  often  male  gender  than  in  the  reference  dataset  (73%  vs  65%,  respectively).  The  other 
demographics were consistent between the pivotal trial and the pooled dataset.  
With  regards 
to  duration  of  exposure,  median 
time  on 
therapy  was 
longer 
in 
the 
pembrolizumab+axitinib arm (10.42 months), when compared to the sunitinib arm (7.82 months) and 
the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD (4.17 months), which is likely associated with the OS benefit as 
compared to the control arm and the 2L settings for the indications in the pembrolizumab monotherapy 
RSD.  Similarly,  proportion  of  subjects  with  exposures  for  >6  or  >12  months  were  higher  in  the 
pembrolizumab+axitinib arm (77.9% and 40.3%), followed by the sunitinib arm (63.5% and 25.4%) and 
the  Pembrolizumab  Monotherapy  RSD  (40.9%  and  19.2%).  Mean  number  of  pembrolizumab 
administrations were higher in the pembrolizumab+axitinib arm (13.8+8.04) than in the Pembrolizumab 
Monotherapy RSD (10.7+9.56). This finding could be related to the disease setting (1L treatment of RCC) 
where the drug combination has been studied.       
Based on the safety  summary  overall AEs were observed in similar proportions in subjects receiving 
pembrolizumab+axitinib compared to those treated with sunitinib. However, the following AE categories 
were reported more frequently in the experimental combination arm: Grade 3-5 AEs (75.8% vs 70.6%), 
Grade 3-5 drug-related AEs (62.9% vs 58.1%), SAEs (40.3% vs 31.3%), drug-related SAEs (23.8% vs 
14.1%), and drug discontinuations due to AEs (30.5% vs 13.5%), to drug-related AEs (25.9% vs 10.1%), 
to SAEs (17.0% vs 9.9%), or to drug-related SAEs (12.4% vs 6.6%). Even adjusting for exposure and 
including  multiple  event  occurrences,  the  increased  rate  of  drug-related  SAEs  (2.87  vs  1.99/100 
person-months, respectively) and of drug discontinuations due to AEs (3.78 vs 1.66/100 person-months, 
respectively),  to  drug-related  AEs  (3.19  vs  1.2/100  person-months,  respectively),  to  SAEs  (1.68  vs 
1.1/100  person-months,  respectively),  or  to  drug-related  SAEs  (1.24  vs  0.71/100  person-months,

respectively) is observed. These data suggest that the tolerability of the combination is poor with a much 
higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs, drug-related AEs and drug-related AEs compared to 
sunitinib and to what observed so far with pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
In KN426, at least one AE was found in almost all participants (98.4% in pembrolizumab+axitinib and 
99.5% 
in  sunitinib)  and  PTs  most  commonly 
(incidence  >30%) 
reported 
for 
the 
pembrolizumab+axitinib arm, in some cases occurred with similar frequencies as in the sunitinib arm: 
Diarrhea  (54.3%  and  44.9%,  respectively),  Hypertension  (44.5%  and  45.4%),  Fatigue  (38.5%  and 
37.9%), and Hypothyroidism (35.4% and 31.5%). Between-treatment comparisons showed increased 
risk  in  the  pembrolizumab-axitinib  arm  (risk  with  95%CI  exceeding  0)  for  Dysphonia,  Arthralgia,  ALT 
increased, AST increased, Diarrhea, Pruritus,  Hyperthyroidism, Cough, Weight decreased, Proteinuria, 
Constipation, Dyspnea, Abdominal pain, while the sunitinib arm was in disadvantage for blood system 
disorders,  Palmar-plantar  erythrodysesthesia  syndrome,  Dysgeusia,  Mucosal  Inflammation  and  some 
gastrointestinal disorders. When looking at exposure-adjusted SOCs incidence, a slightly higher rate of 
Respiratory, 
thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  was 
found 
for 
the  group 
treated  with 
pembrolizumab+axitinib  in  respect  to  that  receiving  sunitinib  (10.5  vs  8.0/100  p-m),  that  could  be 
related to higher Dysphonia rates. Most of other SOCs were reported either less often for the combination 
treatment  versus  controls  (Blood  and  lymphatic  disorders  1.9  vs  14.7/100  p-m,  Gastrointestinal 
disorders  29.4  vs  35.9/100  p-m,  General  disorders  13.0  vs  18.1/100  p-m,  Investigations  18.1  vs 
24.1/100 p-m, Nervous system disorders 6.8 vs 10.7/100 p-m, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
11.6 vs 16.3/100 p-m), or  similarly frequent in the two study arms (Endocrine disorders 5.8 and 5.0/100 
p-m,  Hepatobiliary  disorders  1.3  and  1.2/100  p-m,  Infections  and  infestations  7.6  and  6.8/100  p-m, 
Renal and urinary disorders 4.5 and 4.0/100 p-m). When looking at exposure periods, in both treatment 
arms most event rates were the highest during the first months. Based on indirect comparison of data 
from  Study  KN-426,  Study  A4061051  (Axitinib  monotherapy)  and  available  data  for  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, it is observed that the combination is associated with an increased frequency of some AEs 
compared  to  what  previously  observed  with  monotherapies,  such  as  Diarrhoea,  Hypothiroidism,  ALT 
increased, AST increased, Fatigue, Nausea, Proteinuria, Hyperthyroidism. Grade 3-5 AEs were reported 
in 75.8% of subjects treated with pembrolizumab+axitinib and in 70.6% of those receiving sunitinib. PTs 
with  incidence  rates  >5%  in  the  combination  treatment  were  Hypertension  (22.1%),  ALT  increased 
(13.3%),  Diarrhea  (9.1%),  AST  increased  (7.0%),  Palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome 
(5.1%), while in the sunitinib arm the  following were reported: Hypertension (19.3%), Platelet count 
decreased  (7.3%),  Neutrophil  count  decreased  (6.8%),  Neutropenia  (6.6%),  Fatigue  (6.6%)  and 
Thrombocytopenia  (5.9%).  Between-treatment  risk  differences  with  95%CI  exceeding  0  showed 
advantage of controls over the combination treatment for ALT increased, AST increased and Diarrhea; 
while  pembrolizumab+axitinib  arm  was  in  favor  for  most  Grade  3-5  myelotoxicity  AEs  and  Fatigue. 
Although  median  time  to  first  Grade  3-5  AE  was  shorter  for  the  sunitinib  arm  when  compared  to 
pembrolizumab+axitinib  arm  (10.1  vs  13.1  weeks,  respectively),  no  statistically  significant  difference 
was documented.  
With regards to drug-related AEs, similar overall proportions were reported across study arms (96.3% 
in  pembrolizumab+axitinib  and  97.6%  in  sunitinib).  Type  and  frequency  of  the  most  common  events 
(>30% incidence) in subjects receiving the combination treatment mirrored the expected safety profile of 
drug components, and, apart from Diarrhoea, were not substantially dissimilar from those reported for 
sunitinib-treated  participants  (Diarrhea  49.0%  and  41.2%;  Hypertension  41.7%  and  43.3%, 
Hypothyroidism 31.5% and 28.0%, and Fatigue 30.3% and 33.4%, respectively). Among events with 
incidence >20%, ALT increased (23.8% vs 12.7%), AST increased (22.6% vs 13.9%), and Dysphonia 
(22.8% vs 2.8%) were all more often found in the combination arm when compared to sunitinib. Analysis 
of  between-treatment  difference  was  in  agreement  with  the  results  found  for  overall  AEs  by  showing 
increased risks for the pembrolizumab+axitinib arm of Dysphonia, ALT increased, Hyperthyroidism, AST 
increased, Arthralgia, Pruritus, Diarrhea, Proteinuria, and Cough, and for the sunitinib arm of Dysgeusia,

Thrombocytopenia, Neutropenia, Platelet count decreased, Anemia, Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
syndrome,  Neutrophil  count  decreased,  Dyspepsia,  White  blood  cell  count  decreased,  Mucosal 
inflammation,  Leukopenia,  Gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  Stomatitis,  and  Vomiting  AEs.  Based  on 
indirect comparison of data from Study KN-426, Study A4061051 (Axitinib monotherapy) and available 
data for pembrolizumab monotherapy, it is observed that the combination is associated with an increased 
frequency of some drug-related AEs compared to what previously observed with monotherapies, such as 
Diarrhoea,  Hypothiroidism,  ALT  increased,  AST  increased,  Fatigue,  Nausea,  Proteinuria,  Arthralgia, 
Hyperthyroidism. Proportions of overall grade 3-5 drug-related AEs were somehow increased in the 
pembrolizumab+axitinib arm if compared to the sunitinib arm (62.9% vs 58.1%, respectively). Based on 
investigator’s judgments, within the combination arm, the grade 3-5 drug-related AEs were considered 
related  to  axitinib  (56.9%),  to  pembrolizumab  (37.1%)  or  to  both  the  compounds  (26.1%).  Grade  5 
drug-related AEs were reported in 4 subjects of the pembrolizumab+axitinib arm (0.9%; all considered 
related  to  pembrolizumab  by  investigators)  and  7  subjects  (1.6%)  of  the  sunitinib  arm.  PTs  with 
difference >2% between treatment arms and higher proportions in the pembrolizumab+axitinib than in 
the  sunitinib  group  were:  Hypertension  (21.2%  vs  18.4%,  respectively),  ALT  increased  (12.1%  vs 
18.4%), Diarrhea (7.2% vs 4.5%), and AST increased (6.8% vs 1.6%). Differently, the sunitinib-treated 
group  had  enlarged  proportions  for  Thrombocytopenia  (5.2%  vs  0.0%,  respectively),  Platelet  count 
decreased (7.3% vs 0.2%), Neutropenia (6.6% vs 0.2%), Hypophosphatasemia (2.6% vs 0.5%).   
More subjects in the pembrolizumab+axitinib arm compared to the sunitinib arm were found with SAEs 
(40.3%  vs  31.3%,  respectively).  Most  often  reported  events  for  pembrolizumab+axitinib  arm  were: 
Diarrhea (2.8%), Acute kidney injury (1.6%), ALT increased (1.4%), Dehydration (1.4%), AST increased 
(1.2%),  Hepatic  function  abnormal  (1.2%),  Pneumonitis  (1.2%).  Between-treatment  comparisons  of 
SAEs  showed  sunitinib  being  in  favor  for  Diarrhea,  ALT  increased,  Pneumonitis,  Hepatic  function 
abnormal, AST increased, while combination treatment did not result of advantage for any event. Also, 
drug-related  SAEs  were  more  often  reported  for  the  combination  arm  than  for  controls  (23.8%  vs 
14.1%,  respectively).  Aside  from  the  gastrointestinal  (Diarrhea  1.9%;  Colitis  0.8%)  and  respiratory 
events (Pneumonitis 1.2%; Pulmonary embolism 0.8%), drug-related SAEs due to Hepatobiliar disorders 
were  the  most  frequent  and  were  reported  in  31  subjects  (7.2%):  ALT  increased  (6  subjects),  AST 
increased  (5  subjects),  Hepatic  function  abnormal  (4  subjects),  Hepatitis  (3  subjects),  Hepatocellular 
injury (3 subjects), Hepatic enzyme increased (2 subjects), Liver function test increased (2 subjects), 
Transaminases increased  (2 subjects), Autoimmune hepatitis (1 subject), Blood bilirubin increased (1 
subject), Hepatotoxicity (1 subject), Immune mediated hepatitis (1 subject). Serious drug-related Acute 
kidney injury and Myasthenia gravis were reported in 4 subjects each, while Cerebrovascular event in 3. 
When  drug-related  SAEs  are  analyzed  by  SOCs,  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (4.2%),  Hepatobiliary 
disorders (3.5%) and Investigations (3%, mainly liver tests) were the most frequently reported. Cardiac 
disorders, whilst having rates of 0.4% for pembrolizumab monotherapy, are reported at 1.6% for the 
pembrolizumab+axitinib  arm  (most  common  PTs:  Atrial  fibrillation  and  Myocarditis  in  2  cases  each; 
0.5%) and 1.4% the sunitinib arm.  
With  regard  to  cardiac  disorders,  while  myocarditis  is  a  known  side  effect  of  pembrolizumab,  atrial 
fibrillation is not reported in Pembrolizumab SmPC, nor in axitinib one. Further, analysis of aggregated 
Cardiac  arrhythmias  SMQ  confirmed  an  increased  proportion  of  events  in  subjects  treated  with 
pembrolizumab+axitinib compared to those receiving sunitinib (5.8% vs 2.4%, respectively), and similar 
differences for drug-related AEs (2.3% vs 0.2%) and SAEs (1.4% vs 0.2%). Based on these findings, the 
MAH was asked to provide further information and, if applicable, to propose modifications to the SmPC. 
Cardiac arrhythmias SMQ (0.59 vs 0.28/100 person-months, respectively) and Atrial fibrillation PT (0.2 
vs  0.0/100  person-months,  respectively),  clearly  show  higher  exposure-adjusted  rates  in  KN-426 
pembrolizumab+axitinib-treated 
subjects  when 
compared 
to 
those 
receiving 
sunitinib. 
Exposure-adjusted event rates in RCC patients treated with pembrolizumab combo were similar to those

observed in subjects receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy across indications of the Reference safety 
Dataset, suggesting no additional safety issues when pembrolizumab is combined with axitinib. The query 
of  the  OASE  database  aimed  at  comparing  safety  data  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  including  all 
open-label, unmasked, or completed randomized study for which there has been a database lock on or 
before 31-Mar--2018 (n=9118) with that of all cytotoxic treatments from all studies using chemotherapy 
comparators combined (N=1324) did not find differences in frequency or in exposure-adjusted rates of 
overall and drug-related MedDRA sub-SMQ Cardiac arrhythmias, as well as related PTs. When analyzing 
Atrial fibrillation by age strata, as expected, the risk significantly increases in higher age groups treated 
with  pembrolizumab  (0.2-0.4%  in  subjects  <60  y  vs  1.1-3.4%  in  subjects  >60  y).  Review  of  the 
Company’s global safety Database (MARRS) identified 725 arrhythmia events (atrial fibrillation in 46.76% 
of  cases)  occurring  in  665  subjects  (approximately  90%  SAEs),  having  characteristics  as  expected 
(higher prevalence in males and more aged subjects). While a relatively short elapse of time between 
treatment start and AE occurrence is noted (median 56 days for atrial fibrillation, 33 days for fatal cases), 
the high frequency of concurrent morbidity acts as confounder in causality analysis. The MAH stated that 
there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  suggest  a  causal  relationship  between  pembrolizumab  and  cardiac 
arrhythmia, however, this is not agreed, and as a drug/class-induced safety issue cannot be ruled out. 
The MAH was requested to add atrial fibrillation/cardiac arrhythmias to ADRs in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
(See SmPC 4.8)  
In addition, a trend toward higher incidences of severe and serious Acute kidney injury was notable in the 
pembrolizumab+axitinib group compared to the sunitinib arm, although the numbers are likely to small to 
draw  definitive  conclusion.  The  incidences  of  serious  AEs  were  1.6%  [n=7]  vs  0.7%  [n=3],  (risk 
difference  not  statistically  significant); 
incidences  of  drug-related  SAEs  were  0.9% 
for 
pembrolizumab+axitinib and 0.2% for both sunitinib and the RSD; Grade 3 to 5 events were 1.9% for 
pembrolizumab+axitinib vs 1.2% for sunitinib and 0.9% for the RSD and drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs 
were 0.9% [n=4] vs 0.2% [n=1] for pembrolizumab+axitinib compared to sunitinib. The (higher) rates of 
Nephritis and Creatinine increased (compared to the RSD) are depicted in the SmPC. Review of the renal 
toxicity,  showed    a  higher  proportion  of  Renal  Adverse  Events  (40.3%  vs.  29.4%,  respectively),  in 
particular of drug-related and of more severe renal AEs, for the pembrolizumab+axitinib in respect to the 
SOC arm. PTs with largest difference between study treatments were the following: Proteinuria, Acute 
renal  failure,  Renal  failure  and  Renal  impairment.  The  well-known  association  of  diarrhea  and  acute 
kidney  failure  occurred  only  in  few  participants.  No  modifications  to  the  SmPC  are  needed,  as  Acute 
Kidney Injury is already included in Table 2 of Section 4.8 and Proteinuria rates appear overall similar to 
those reported for axitinib monotherapy.  
Subjects with AEs leading to deaths up to 90 days of last dose were quite comparable among study arms 
with  11  (2.6%)  subjects  in  the  pembrolizumab+axitinib  and  15  (3.5%)  in  the  sunitinib  arm.  In  the 
combination arm reported reasons for death were: Cardiac arrest, Death, Myasthenia gravis, Myocarditis, 
Necrotizing fasciitis, Plasma cell myeloma, Pneumonitis, Pulmonary embolism, Pulmonary thrombosis, 
and Respiratory failure (all registered in one case each). In the combination treatment, 4 fatal events 
were judged by the investigator to be associated with pembrolizumab: Myasthenia gravis, Myocarditis, 
Necrotizing  fasciitis,  and  Pneumonitis.  With  regard  to  the  AEs  leading  to  death  considered 
pembrolizumab-related by investigator, Pneumonitis, Myastenic syndrome and Myocarditis are already 
reported in Keytruda SmPC. After additional review of Necrotizing fasciitis as possibly immune-related 
event, based on available information it is agreed with the MAH that data are currently insufficient to 
support  an  update  of  the  SmPC  and  that  these  AEs  will  be  further  monitored  through  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. Though it is noted that in 6 out of the 11 patients who died following AEs, 
there was an history of hepatic toxicity during treatment exposure (Grade 4 in 1 case, Grade 3 in 4 cases 
and Grade 1 in the remaining case) and that in two instances (ID numbers redacted) the time between

hepatic AE and death is rather short, based on patient history review,  a relationship between the liver 
toxicity and the fatal outcome is considered unlikely.  
In the group treated with pembrolizumab-axitinib, the proportions of overall AEOSIs (51.3% vs 36.2%) 
and  of  all  event  categories  (except  deaths)  were  increased  in  respect  to  the  sunitinib  group.  Dose 
modifications  and  treatment  discontinuations  due  to  AEOSIs  were  much  more  frequent  with  the 
combination  compared  to  sunitib  and  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  (Reference  safety  dataset).  A 
difference of >2% in frequencies between study arms were found for Adrenal insufficiency (3.0% vs 0.2% 
in pembrolizumab-axitinib and sunitinib groups respectively), Hepatitis (2.8% vs 0.5%), Hyperthyroidism 
(12.8%  vs  3.8%),  Pneumonitis  (2.8%  vs  0.2%),  and  Thyroiditis  (2.8%  vs  0.5%).  Notably,  similar 
proportions across study arms were reported for Hypothyroidism and Nephritis. AEOSIs with Grade 3-5 in 
severity were documented in 10.7% of subjects treated with combination treatment and in only 1.9% of 
those receiving sunitinib. Distribution of outcomes of AEOSIs were similar in KN426 study arms, with 
approximately  one  third  that  resolved  without  sequelae.  Fatal  events  were  Pneumonitis,  Myasthenic 
Syndrome, Myocarditis in one case each of the combination arm and Hepatitis in the sunitinib arm. With 
regard to Myositis, the MAH adapted Table 2 and classified the AE of myositis in the same frequency 
category for pembrolizumab monotherapy and the combination with axitinib.  
Out  of  the  12  Hepatitis  AEOSIs,  that  presented  after  a  median  of  54  days,  10  were  judged  to  be 
drug-related (9 Grade 3-5) and 9 were classified as SAEs. Overall, 67% of patients were treated with 
corticosteroids, and, except 1 that developed sequelae, all resolved (9 subjects; 75%) or were resolving 
at the time of data cut-off (2 subjects; 16.7%).  
With regards to thyroid AEOSIs, in the safety profile of pembrolizumab+axitinib an exceeding frequency 
of  Hypothyroidism  as  well  as  of  Hyperthyroidism  is  noted  in  respect  to  known  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy  safety.  Furthermore,  a  slight  increase  in  Thyroiditis  is  also  found  (2.8%  in 
pembrolizumab+axitinib vs 0.5% in sunitinib). Although these are expected ADR of both pembrolizumab 
and axitinib, the frequencies appear relevant, in particular for hyperthyroidism. Median time to onset was 
approximately  similar  among  combination  treatment  and  pembrolizumab  monotherapy.  Regarding 
outcomes, while most of hypothyroidism events did not resolve (62.5%) (and are treated with continued 
hormone replacement therapy), most of the hyperthyroidism events (85.5%) reassuringly did resolve. It 
is agreed not to add the information regarding high rate of thyroid disturbances when pembrolizumab is 
used in combination with axitinib in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, as frequencies [very common] are provided 
in Table 2 of Section 4.8.  
With regards to laboratory findings,  in the pembrolizumab+axitinib arm the following were the most 
common  abnormalities:  Glucose  increased  (61.9%),  ALT  increased  (59.6%),  AST  increased  (56.7%), 
Creatinine increased (43.0%), Sodium decreased (35.0%), Potassium increased (34.1%), Lymphocyte 
decreased 
(33.3%),  and  Albumin  decreased 
(31.9%).  When 
comparing 
study  arms, 
pembrolizumab+axitinib had higher liver test abnormalities, while the sunitinib arm showed increased 
myelotoxicity abnormalities. 
Analysis of treatment-emergent Hepatic Adverse Events, defined by 3 MedDRA SMQs and hepatitis 
AEOSI  and  assessed  in  the  overall  study  population  and  in  the  Hepatic  Events  Analysis  Set  (HEAS; 
n=287),  showed  in  the  pembrolizumab+axitinib  arm  when  compared  to  sunitinib  controls  increased 
proportions of overall hepatic events (40.6% vs 26.6%), drug-related hepatic AEs (34.3% vs 20.7%), 
grade 3-5 hepatic AEs (21.2% vs 6.1%), grade 3-5 drug-related hepatic AEs (18.9% vs 4.0%), serious 
hepatic  AEs  (7.0%  vs  0.9%),  serious  drug-related  hepatic  AEs  (6.3%  vs  0.5%),  and  of  drug 
discontinuation due to hepatic AEs (13.3% vs 0.5%), to drug-related hepatic AEs (13.1% vs 0.5%), to 
serious  hepatic  AEs  (4.9%  vs  0.2%),  and  to  serious  drug-related  hepatic  AEs  (4.7%  vs  0.2%).  Most

common (>1% incidence) PTs for hepatic AEs were principally ALT increased (26.8%; grade 3-5 13.3%; 
drug-related  23.8%)  and  AST  increased  (26.1%;  grade  3-5  7.0%;  drug-related  22.6%),  followed  by 
Blood bilirubin increased (6.5%; grade 3-5 0.9%; drug-related 4.4%), Hepatic function abnormal (3.5%; 
grade  3-5  1.6%;  drug-related  3.0%),  γ-GT  increased  (1.9%;  grade  3-5  0.9%;  drug-related  0.7%), 
Hepatitis  (1.6%;  grade  3-5  1.4%;  drug-related  1.4%),  Hyperbilirubinemia  (1.6%;  grade  3-5  0%; 
drug-related 1.2%), Liver function test increased (1.2%; grade 3-5 0.7%; drug-related 0.7%). Subjects 
treated  with  pembrolizumab+axitinib  in  comparison  to  those  receiving  sunitinib,  showed  higher 
proportions in ALT and AST increased. Additionally, ALT or AST elevation concurrent with total bilirubin 
elevation  (+/-  ALP  elevation)  was  more  common  in  the  pembrolizumab+axitinib  arm.Evaluation  of 
Drug-Induced Serious Hepatotoxicity (eDISH) plots displayed subjects (n=15) in the Hy’s Law quadrant, 
raising the concern of Drug-Induced Liver Injury with pembrolizumab+axitinib. First treatment-emergent 
ALT >3xULN events, that occurred after a mean of 103 days of exposure and was treated with systemic 
steroids  in  62-100%  of  cases  (growing  frequency  with  increasing  severity),  resolved  in  82-94%  of 
subjects with decreasing frequency based on highest level reached. Based on ALT increase category (≥3 
x ULN, ≥5 x ULN, ≥10 x ULN and ≥20 x ULN), re-challenge with combination treatment was carried out 
in 51-11% of cases, with further ALT elevation (>3xULN) event in 43.6% with consequent recovery in all 
(guidance  for  evaluation  and  management  of  patients  with  AST/ALT  elevation,  including  algorithms 
regarding study drug rechallenge, were progressively updated during the study conduction). In only 7 
patients ALT did not recover to Grade 0-1 after the first hepatic event (ALT ≥ 3xULN). For most of these 
patients, non-recovery appeared to be related to limited follow-up (lack of follow-up data, death, event 
15 days prior to data cutoff). No correlation could be determined with lack of corticosteroid treatment 
based on this limited number. 41 patients (45%) had a recurrence of ALT elevation after rechallenge with 
treatment and all recovered (see Table 4.5.23). In  the pembrolizumab + axitinib arm 92 participants 
received study treatment following recovery of the first ALT ≥3 x ULN. Of these 41 participants (44.6%) 
had a second episode of ALT ≥3xULN, 23 (56%) received steroids, and all recovered to <3xULN prior to 
the data cutoff. Considering that 44% of patients (18/41) recovered also from the second hepatic event 
without corticosteroid treatment it is not justified to recommend corticosteroids as mandatory. 
Within the HEAS population, ALT≥3xULN occurrence seems not associated with clinically relevant patient 
or  disease  characteristics  or  use  of  potentially  concomitant  hepatotoxic  medications.  Due  to  first 
ALT≥3xULN event, median treatment delay was of 37.5 days, and subjects permanently discontinuing 
pembrolizumab+axitinib  due  to  hepatic  toxicity  in  73%  of  cases  subsequently  received  antineoplastic 
therapy.  
With regard to corticosteroid treatment for hepatic AEs, it is notable that the lack of immunosuppressive 
therapy did not appear to have had a negative impact on the rate of recovery and only 62% received 
systemic steroids for ALT ≥3 x ULN, 76% for ALT ≥5 x ULN and 84.4% for ALT ≥ 10 x ULN, although 
systemic  corticosteroids  had  been  recommended  in  the  protocol  for  Grade  ≥   2  AEs  in  line  with 
recommendations  in  the  SmPC.  The  MAH  clarified  that  Management  guidelines  implemented  in  the 
protocol  (Amendment  8)  recommended  to  promptly  interrupt  both  study  drugs  if  ALT/AST  elevations 
>3×ULN  were  observed  and  initiate  steroids  only  if  the  elevations  did  not  resolve  promptly  without 
corticosteroid treatment (recommendations based on the difference in half-life of axitinib (~6 hours) and 
pembrolizumab  (3  to  4  weeks).  Further,  the  MAH  provided  data  to  support  that  the  frequency  of 
corticosteroid  use  for  hepatic  AEs  in  KEYNOTE-426  is  generally  consistent  with  the  frequency  of 
corticosteroid  use  for  the  adverse  event  of  special  interest  (AEOSI)  of  hepatitis  across  the  entire 
pembrolizumab  program  (that  means  that  despite  the  recommendations  in  the  SmPC  to  initiate 
corticosteroid treatment for hepatic AEs ≥2, corticosteroids are applied in a lower proportion in clinical 
practice). Data for re-challenge of patients with more severe ALT elevations (ALT ≥10 × ULN, ALT ≥20 × 
ULN, and ALT ≥3 × ULN associated with bilirubin ≥2 × ULN) were provided and show, although based on 
limited  patient  numbers,  that  even  in  these  patients  subsequent  recurrences  following  re-challenge 
recovered again. In the SmPC, for subjects with “ALT or AST ≥ 10 times ULN or > 3 times ULN with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 178/193 
 
 
 
concurrent  total  bilirubin  ≥   2  times  ULN,  both  KEYTRUDA  and  axitinib  should  be  permanently 
discontinued and corticosteroid therapy may be considered” according to the SmPC which is endorsed.   
In  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC,  “rechallenge  with  a  single  medicine  or  sequential  rechallenge  with  both 
medicines after recovery may be considered” if ALT or AST ≥ 3 times ULN but < 10 times ULN. According 
to Table 4.5.23 the choice of retreatment after recovery did not appear to influence the probability of a 
second hepatic AE (nearly 50%). However only 3 patients received pembrolizumab monotherapy after 
recovery  and  median  duration  of  treatment  after  recovery  was  only  28  days  for  pembro  mono  (as 
opposed to 155 days for axitinib monotherapy in 34 patients and 263 days for pembrolizumab + axitinib 
in 55 patients). Drug discontinuation was due to PD in 2 out of 3 cases. In view of these limited data the 
recommendation of a rechallenge with pembrolizumab as monotherapy appears somewhat questionable, 
but from provided updated data it appears to be no profound rationale to assume that a re-challenge with 
pembrolizumab mono would not be a reasonable option for patients with axitinib related AEs or that one 
sequence of re-challenge would be more preferable.  
In  the  same  SmPC  section,  the  MAH  provided  dosing  guidelines  for  liver  enzyme  elevations  when 
Keytruda is combined with axitinib: 
In  participants  with  ALT  or  AST  ≥3×ULN  to  <10×ULN,  without  concurrent  total  bilirubin  elevation  a 
higher  proportion  of  patients  without  steroids  did  not  recover  (14%;  4/29)  compared  to  those  that 
received high or low dose steroids (2%; 1/42). However, most of the patients without steroid treatment 
recovered (86%; 25/29), time to recovery was similar for all patients and numbers for non-recovered 
patients after the first AE are too small to draw definitive conclusions and justify steroid treatment for all 
patients treated with the combination therapy. In participants with ALT or AST ≥10×ULN, or ALT/AST ≥
3×ULN with concurrent total bilirubin ≥2×ULN most of the patients received steroids (34/44) and 6.8% 
(3/44) patients did not recover from the first events, but all received steroid treatment. In view of these 
data, the very general recommendation for patients with liver enzyme elevations “corticosteroid therapy 
may be considered” can be considered acceptable. 
The rewording of the text applicable to RCC patients in Table 1 of Section 4.2 of the SmPC is endorsed 
(see  SmPC),  but  the  different  approach  used  with  regards  to  subjects  with  ALT  >5  times  ULN, 
(permanently discontinue for all indications while could be rechallenged in RCC) might be misleading as 
in  section  4.4  (Immune-related  hepatitis)  it  is  stated  that  “Corticosteroid  should  be  administered”. 
Concerning  this,  the  MAH  clarified  that  the  provided  information  is  meant  to  be  understood  as 
complementary in view of the different underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of both drugs. This is 
acceptable.  
In  addition,  the  MAH    provided  data  for  37 patients with  a  second  re-challenge  (with  pembrolizumab 
alone,  axitinib  alone  or  both  pembrolizumab  and  axitinib).  A  total  of  12  participants  had  another 
recurrence of ALT ≥3×ULN, most of these subsequent ALT elevations (7 out of 12) were ≥3 to <5×ULN 
and all these recurrent ALT elevations subsequently resolved. Despite the limited patient numbers, it is 
agreed that data support the safety of multiple re-challenges. Based on provided updated data including 
results for a second re-challenge of study drugs, there appears to be no profound rationale to assume that 
a  re-challenge  with  pembrolizumab  mono  would  not  be  a  reasonable  option  for  patients  with  axitinib 
related AEs or that one sequence of re-challenge would be more preferable. The MAH further clarifies that 
the recommendation to discontinue pembrolizumab permanently for recurrent Grade 3 adverse reactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455620/2019  
Page 179/193 
 
 
 
 
 
applies also for the combination therapy but only for immune-related (hepatic) events. This is further 
clarified in the SmPC by: 
“KEYTRUDA, as monotherapy or as combination therapy, should be permanently discontinued for Grade 
4 or recurrent Grade 3 immune-related adverse reactions, unless otherwise specified in Table 1”. 
In section 4.4, the MAH added the following paragraph: 
The inclusion of this paragraph and its wording is supported, as it is agreed that an increased incidence of 
elevated ALT and AST represents the most frequent observed hepatic AEs, and reflects the hepatic AE 
profile associated with the combination of pembrolizumab+axitinib most appropriately. Although, “more 
frequent monitoring” may be considered an unclear indication, as in the SmPCs of pembrolizumab and 
axitinib there an exact frequency of monitoring is not stated, the MAH argues that the frequency of liver 
function monitoring depends on the clinical circumstances and that a more definitive recommendation 
would not be considered helpful to address this variability, and this is agreed.  
KN426  safety  analyses  did  show  more  subjects  receiving  pembrolizumab+axitinib  having  drug 
discontinuation  due  to  AEs  than those treated with sunitinib (25.9% vs 10.1%, respectively). The 
observed  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  the  discontinuation  of  any  drug  was  30.5%  in  the 
pembrolizumab+axitinib  group,  but  simultaneous  discontinuation  of  both  drugs 
in 
the 
pembrolizumab+axitinib  group  (7.7%)  was  lower  compared  with  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of 
sunitinib (13.9%). The most common reason for stopping study drug in the combination arm was ALT 
increased (31 subjects, [7.2 %]) AST increased (20 subjects, [4.7%]), and Hepatic function abnormal (6 
subjects, [1.4%]). When looking at frequency and reasons for specific study drug discontinuation, no 
relevant differences could be found between pembrolizumab and axitinib. Median time to discontinuation 
is  around  60  days.  Overall  interruption  of  study  drugs  due  to  AEs  was  reported  in  69.9%  for 
pembrolizumab  and/or  axitinib  (pembrolizumab  and  axitinib  35.7%,  pembrolizumab  50.3%,  axitinib 
63.9%)  and  in  49.9%  for  sunitinib.  Among  reasons,  diarrhoea  and  transaminase  elevation  were  as 
frequently  recorded  for  pembrolizumab  and  axitinib,  this  latter  was  interrupted  more  often  due  to 
Hypertension (13.3% vs 0.7%, respectively) and Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (6.8% 
vs  0.5%,  respectively).  Compared  to  sunitinib,  in  the  pembrolizumab+axitinib  arm  an  overall  lower 
proportion  of  subjects  with  dose  reduction  due  to  AEs  (20.3%  vs  30.1%,  respectively),  due  to 
drug-related AEs (20% vs 28.5%), or due to grade 3-5 AEs (10.3% vs 14.4%) were found.  
AEs  summary  by  subgroups shows an increase in incidences of all AEs categories for elderly across 
treatments,  with  a  more  pronounced  difference  between  younger  and  older  age  categories  in 
pembrolizumab+axitinib-treated  subjects  than  in  those  receiving  suntinib.  Between-treatment 
comparisons showed the largest differences in AEs frequencies among the 75-84 age group. With only 36 
participants  ≥75  years  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  axitinib  group  the  safety  data  were  insufficient  for  a 
thorough characterization in this age group, and this has been reflected in the SmPC.  
At gender analyses, female subjects had higher proportions of grade 3-5 AEs (82.9% vs 72.9%) and of 
drug-related grade 3-5 AEs (71.5% vs 59.5%), while SAE, drug-related SAEs compared to males, while 
discontinuations were not dissimilar between subgroups. Also, in the sunitinib arm, a higher frequency of 
grade 3-5 AEs and grade 3-5 drug-related AEs was found in females compared to males. Frequency of AEs

leading to death was slightly higher in males (3.3%) than in females (0.8%), in accordance with that 
found in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD (5.1%). AEs summary table by KPS ranges (90/100 vs 
70/80) did not show relevant differences in safety profiles among groups With regards to extrinsic factors, 
the  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab+axitinib  was  comparable  between  geographical  regions  of 
enrollment.     
Immunogenicity  assessment  in  pembrolizumab+axitinib-treated  subjects  documented  treatment 
emergent ADA in 6.2% (1.4–3.8% for pembrolizumab monotherapy across indications) and incidence of 
treatment-emergent neutralizing positive status in 0.8% (0.2–1.6% for pembrolizumab monotherapy). 
Due to limited number of patients with treatment-emergent ADA, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the 
impact on safety profile or to merit further investigations regarding possible confounding factors. 
Comparison of AEs for pembrolizumab+axitinib in KN426 versus axitinib in study A4061051 
There  is  no  direct  comparison  between  pembrolizumab+axitinib  and  axitinib  alone.  Therefore,  the 
assessment of safety should take into account the limitation of indirect comparison between different 
studies.  Based  on  the  data  provided,  proportions  of  subjects  with  overall  AEs  (98.4%  vs  88.9%, 
respectively)  and  of  drug-related  AEs  (96.3%  vs  86.2%,  respectively)  were  higher  in  pembrolizumab 
combination treatment in respect to axitinib when used for RCC treatment. The pattern of most common 
PTs found for the combination treatment was similar to that reported for axitinib monotherapy: Diarrhea 
(54.3% and 49.7%, respectively) Hypertension (44.5% and 48.7%, respectively), Fatigue (38.5% and 
32.8%,  respectively),  Decreased  appetite  (29.6%  and  28.6%,  respectively),  Palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (28%  and  26.5%),  Dysphonia  (25.4%  and  23.3%,  respectively). 
Compared to axitinib, in pembrolizumab+axitinib-treated subjects, increased proportions of thyroid AEs 
(Hypothyroidism  35.4%  vs  20.6%;  Hyperthyroidism  12.8%  vs  3.2%,  respectively)  as  well  as  of 
hepatotoxicity  (ALT  increased  26.8%  vs  10.6%;  AST  increased  26.1%  vs  7.9%,  respectively)  were 
reported.  Incidences  of  Grade  3  to  5  hypertension,  ALT  increased,  and  AST  increased  were  higher  in 
pembrolizumab+axitinib as expected based on the safety profile for axitinib monotherapy; Hypertension 
is a known AE for axitinib, but the reason for the higher incidence of Grade 3 to 5 hypertension (22.1%) 
in  the  pembrolizumab  +  axitinib  group  relative  to  what  was  observed  for  axitinib  in  Study  A4061051 
(13.8%) remains unclear; however apart from one Grade 4 event (hypertensive crisis), all events were 
Grade 3 and only 1 participant discontinued either pembrolizumab or axitinib due to hypertension.  
Noteworthy the incidence of drug-related SAEs in the pembrolizumab + axitinib group (23.8%) was four 
times higher relative to what was observed for axitinib monotherapy in Study A4061051 (5.3%). While 
the incidence of Diarrhoea was similar to what was observed for axitinib in Study A4061051 (2.8% versus 
2.6%, respectively), the rates of hepatic SAEs as well as of ALT increased and AST increased, in particular 
Grade 3 to 4 elevations, in the pembrolizumab + axitinib group were higher than would be expected from 
the combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib monotherapies. 
Comparison  of  AEs 
for  pembrolizumab+axitinib 
in  KN426  versus  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in KN427 study 
In the indirect comparison between the KN426 and the KN427, both conducted for treatment of RCC, 
whilst similar proportions of subjects with overall AEs in the two treatment strategies, drug-related AEs 
were more often found in pembrolizumab combination treatment compared to monotherapy (96.3% vs 
80.9%, respectively). The frequency of almost all most common (>30% incidence) PTs reported for in 
pembrolizumab+axitinib  resulted  higher  than  that  found  with  pembrolizumab  monotherapy:  Diarrhea 
(54.3%  vs  22.7%,  respectively),  Hypertension  (44.5%  vs  8.2%,  respectively),  Fatigue  (38.5%  vs 
38.2%, respectively), Hypothyroidism (35.4% vs 11.2%, respectively).

Dataset 
Assessment report

In comparison with the pooled reference dataset for pembrolizumab monotherapy across indications, the 
KN426 AEs summary highlights a clearly worse safety profile for pembrolizumab when associated with 
axitinib. Indeed, higher incidence of drug-related AEs (96.3% vs 70.7%, respectively), Grade 3-5 AEs 
(75.8% vs 48.5%), Grade 3-5 drug-related AEs (62.9% vs 14.9%) and drug-related SAEs (23.8% vs 
10.5%) were found. Furthermore, while AEs leading to deaths were similar in 
pembrolizumab+axitinib-treated subjects of KN426 and the pooled monotherapy dataset, a considerably 
higher proportion of subjects experienced overall and drug-related AEs leading to drug discontinuation, 
interruption or dose modification with the combination.  With regards to AEOSIs, a higher proportion of 
subjects with at least one event was found in the combination arm compared to pembrolizumab 
monotherapy for overall and all event categories (overall 51.3% vs 22.7%, drug-related events 47.1% vs 
19.4%, grade 3-5 events 10.7% vs 5.7%, grade 3-5 drug-related events 8.9% vs 4.9%, and SAEs (9.8% 
vs 5.8%). Adrenal Insufficiency (3.0% vs 0.8%), Hepatitis (2.8% vs 0.7%), Hyperthyroidism (12.8% vs 
3.3%), Hypothyroidism (35.4% vs 9.9%), Nephritis (1.4% vs 0.3%), Thyroiditis (2.8% vs 0.7%) all had 
a >1% higher incidence in the combination treatment when compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy. 
Median time to first AEOSI tended to be shorter in the combination treatment than in the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy dataset for the following events: Hepatitis (54 vs 61 days, respectively), Hypothyroidism 
(94 vs 105 days), and Myasthenic syndrome (40.5 vs 57.5 days). Compared to pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, a higher incidence of adrenal insufficiency is noted in subjects treated with pembrolizumab 
combined with axitinib, however rates are low and possibly related to longer exposure in RCC setting than 
in other indications. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety assessment of the combination of pembrolizumab+axitinib is partially hampered by 
the lack of a direct comparison with axitinib in particular within a single study. For 1L treatment of 
subjects with advanced RCC, the overall safety profile of pembrolizumab+axitinib compares less 
favourable to sunitinib, but demonstrated as apparently overall manageable. In KEYNOTE-426, a higher 
rate of all adverse event categories (particularly grade 3-5 AES, SAEs and drug discontinuations due to 
AEs) for the combination of pembrolizumab with axitinib. Even adjusting for exposure an increased rate 
of drug-related SAEs and of drug discontinuations due to AEs is observed. 
Based on indirect comparison the combination has a clearly worst safety profile compare to 
monotherapies. Many of the observed toxicities (i.e. diarrhea, hypertension, dysphonia, fatigue, 
palmar-plantar erythrodysaestesia syndrome) mirror the known individual safety profiles of axitinib and 
pembrolizumab, although with a higher incidence for some of them. The high occurrence of hepatic 
adverse events has been addressed in the SmPC (sections 4.2, 4.4. 4.8). A higher frequency Cardiac 
Arrythmias SMQ/Atrial Fibrillation is observed in the pembrolizumab/axitinib arm compared to the 
sunitinib arm in KN-426 trial. As causal relationship with pembrolizumab cannot be ruled out, the MAH 
has added atrial fibrillation/cardiac arrhythmias to ADRs in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Study KEYNOTE 426 was added to the pharmacovigilance plan in order to address existing safety 
concerns in the new indication (first line treatment of advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma). 
Risk minimisation measures 
No changes to the risk minimisation measures were made as a result of this extension of indication.  
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated.  
The MAH provided supporting extensive summary tables for section 4.8 of the SmPC. The MAH provided 
a summary Table of ADRs with related frequencies (all grades and grade 3-5) to support the new column 
for the use of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib. 
The package leaflet has been updated accordingly in section 1. The base file for the revised Product 
Information in the current submission is the final Product Information from variations 
EMEA/H/C/3820/II/058 & II/047 and PSUSA/00010403/201803. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has  been  submitted  by  the  applicant  and  has  been  found  acceptable  for  the  following  reasons:  The 
proposed changes in the context of this extension of indication do not involve a relevant impact on the 
PIL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This extension of indication of Keytruda is for the first line treatment of advanced or metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) in combination with axitinib.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the EU, the following agents targeting the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway are approved for the 1L 
treatment of advanced RCC: sunitinib, pazopanib, bevacizumab + IFNα, tivozanib and cabozantinib (in 
patients who are considered to be intermediate and poor risk). 
In addition to agents that target VEGFR and VEGF, other approved agents for advanced RCC include the 
mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus for patients considered to be poor risk (per the MSKCC risk category) in the 
1L setting and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus 
Recently, the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab was approved in the EU for use in treatment-naïve 
patients with advanced RCC who were considered to be intermediate or poor risk per the IMDC criteria. 
According to the main guidelines (RCC: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and 
follow-up, update January 2019; NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: kidney cancer: version 
3.2019) tumor histology and risk stratification is important in treatment selection. A prognostic model

derived from a population of patients with metastatic RCC treated with VEGF-targeted treatment has 
been more recently developed, known as International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) 
score: this model take into consideration six clinical parameters to stratify patients into favourable, 
intermediate and poor prognosis groups: interval from diagnosis to treatment less than 1 year, Karnofski 
PS<80%, corrected serum calcium>ULN, serum hemoglobin<ULN, absolute neutrophil count>ULN and 
platelets>ULN. The IMDC model has been derived from a retrospective study of 645 patients treated with 
VEGF-targeted agents (Heng DY, et al. J Clin Oncol 2009), and validated in an independent dataset (Heng 
DY, et al.Lancet Oncol 2013). The 2-year OS ranges from 75% in the favourable risk group (none of the 
6 factors identified) to 7% in the poor-risk group (3 to 6 factors identified). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is based upon the interim analysis 1 of KEYNOTE-426 Study, is an ongoing, Phase 3, 
randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, 2 arms, open-label clinical study in first line adult patients 
with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), comparing the combination of pembrolizumab 200mg Q3W + 
axitinib 5 mg BID with sunitinib 50 mg QD 4 weeks on 2 weeks off. 
The primary objectives of the study were to compare the OS and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR in 
participants treated with pembrolizumab  + axitinib vs sunitinib. ORR, DCR, DoR, safety and tolerability 
profile of pembrolizumab, PFS and OS rate at 12, 24 and 18 months, and PROs were secondary 
objectives.  
A total of 861 patients were randomly allocated in one of the 2 arms from 24-OCT-2016 to 24-JAN-2018 
across 124 global study sites in 16 countries. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  A statistically significant benefit in OS has been observed for pembrolizumab + axitinib over 
sunitinib (HR of 0.53, 95% CI 0.38, 0.74; p=0.00005);  
•  A statistically significant benefit in PFS has been also observed for pembrolizumab + axitinib over 
sunitinib (HR of 0.69, 95% CI 0.57, 0.84; p=0.00014); 
•  Objective response rate based on BICR assessment were observed in 59.3% (95% CI 54.5,63.9) 
of the patients treated with the combination compared to 35.7% (95% CI 31.1,40.4) in the 
control arm. The median time to response is similar in the two arms, while the duration of 
response tend to be longer in the experimental arm with 70.6% of patients still in response at 12 
months in the control arm vs 61.6% in the control arm. 
•  Updated data confirmed the OS benefit in the overall population, as well as in the IDMC poor 
(HR= 0.50, 95%CI 0.29,0.87) and intermediate (HR= 0.52, 95%CI 0.36,0.75) risk categories. 
•  Updated PFS data show a trend to an improved effect in the IDMC favourable risk subgroup 
compared to data initially submitted. 
• 
Permanent discontinuation treatment due to AEs does not seem to negatively affect neither the 
outcome of patients on subsequent treatments nor their prognosis if left untreated.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
The immaturity of efficacy data that do not allow to draw any sound conclusion with regard to the 
IMDC favourable risk group (HR 0.94, 95%CI 0.43, 2.07). The OS KM curves in this subgoup are 
Assessment report

Page 188/193 
 
 
 
 
superimposable at this stage. The final CSR should be provided post-approval, in particular to 
further characterize the benefit of the combination treatment. 
• 
The lack of monotherapy experimental arms in study KN-426 hampers the assessment of the 
contribution of each component of the combination treatment. However, a positive contribution 
of each component can be assumed on the basis of the plausible mechanism of action of the two 
agents in the combination, evidence of single-agent activity, high activity of the combination in 
terms of ORR and PFS compared to monotherapy albeit in indirect comparisons, and the 
established contribution of these agents in different tumour types.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety assessment of the combination of pembrolizumab+axitinib is partially hampered 
by the lack of a direct comparison within a single study. In the pembrolizumab+axitinib arm when 
compared to the sunitinib arm, the following were found:  
• 
Increased frequencies of all AE categories, except for deaths;  
•  Confirmed higher risk for drug-related SAE (2.87 vs 1.99/100 p-m, respectively) and for all types 
of AEs leading to drug discontinuation when exposure-adjusted rates were considered; 
• 
Increased risk of drug-related transaminase elevation and drug-related dysphonia;  
•  Overall AEOSIs frequency of 51.3% vs 36.2%; 
•  Overall treatment-emergent Hepatic Adverse Events frequency of 40.6% vs 26.6%;  
•  Non-fatal Drug-Induced Liver Injury in 15 subjects;    
•  High frequency of thyroid adverse events: Hyperthyroidism 12.8% vs 3.8%, Hypothyroidism 
35.4% vs 31.5%, Thyroiditis 2.8% vs 0.5%; 
• 
• 
The incidences of ALT increased and AST increased, in particular Grade 3 to 4 elevations, were 
higher than would be expected from the combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib 
monotherapies; the incidences of the PTs ALT and AST increased were 26.8% and 26.1%, 
respectively in the pembrolizumab+axitinib group, 6.0% and 6.2% in the RSD, and 10.6% and 
7.9% for axitinib in Study A4061051. 
Incidences of Grade 3 to 5 hypertension (22.1%) and hyperthyroidism (12.8%) in the 
pembrolizumab + axitinib group were higher compared to those for sunitinib, pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, and axitinib. However both AEs were clinically manageable. 
•  A trend toward higher incidences of severe and serious acute kidney injury was notable in the 
pembrolizumab + axitinib group; however absolute numbers were small (Grade 3 to 5 events 
1.9%, SAEs 1.6). 
•  Among-drug  related  SAEs,  it  is  noted  that  cardiac  disorders,  whilst  having  rates  of  0.4%  for 
pembrolizumab monotherapy, are reported at 1.6% for the pembrolizumab+axitinib arm (1.4% 
the  sunitinib  arm).  Cardiac  arrhythmias  SMQ  showed  an  increased  proportion  of  events  in 
subjects treated with pembrolizumab+axitinib compared to those receiving sunitinib (5.8% vs 
2.4%,  respectively),  and  similar  differences  for  drug-related  AEs  (2.3%  vs  0.2%)  and  SAEs 
(1.4%  vs  0.2%).  Similarly,  subjects  with  Atrial  Fibrillation  were  1.6%  vs  0.2%,  respectively.

The safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib compares unfavourable to sunitinib in 1L 
RCC treatment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
•  Safety data in the age group ≥75 years are limited. This is reflected in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib demonstrated superiority vs sunitinib in terms of PFS and 
OS in patients with advanced RCC, supported by an advantage in terms of ORR. Based on updated data, 
a benefit in PFS and ORR is observed across all IMDC risk group, with no apparent detrimental OS effect 
in the favourable risk.   
For 1L treatment of subjects with advanced RCC, the overall safety profile of pembrolizumab+axitinib 
compares less favourable to sunitinib, but demonstrated as apparently overall manageable. In 
KEYNOTE-426, a higher rate of all adverse event categories (particularly grade 3-5 AES, SAEs and drug 
discontinuations due to AEs) for the combination of pembrolizumab with axitinib. Even adjusting for 
exposure an increased rate of drug-related SAEs and of drug discontinuations due to AEs is observed.  
Concerns were raised regarding high occurrence of hepatic adverse events, which are addressed in the 
SmPC. Taking into account the worse safety profile of the combination compared to sunitinib, it is 
reassuring that permanent discontinuation treatment due to AEs does not seem to negatively affect 
neither the outcome of patients on subsequent treatments nor their prognosis if left untreated.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, a benefit in terms of PFS and ORR was observed across all IMDC risk group with pembrolizumab 
and axitinib compared to sunitinib. Although the safety profile of the combination compares less 
favourable to sunitinib, it appears overall manageable. The benefits of the combination treatment are 
considered to outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of pembrolizumab in the first line treatment of advanced or metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma, in combination with axitinib, is positive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to clinical efficacy:  
The final CSR of the pivotal Keynote-426 study should be provided post-approval as Annex II condition, 
in particular to further characterize the benefit of the combination treatment in the favourable IDMC risk 
group with longer follow-up.

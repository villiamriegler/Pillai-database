Propranolol can aggravate hypoglycaemia in children, 
existing warning on hypoglycaemia and of the 
Package Leaflet to amend the existing warnings on 
hypotension/bradycardia and hypoglycaemia 
following the completion of a Drug Utilisation Study 
(DUS) performed in Germany and France to evaluate 
off-label use and effectiveness of RMM in a real-life 
clinical setting (MEA 002); the Annex II to the 
Opinion is updated in accordance. In addition, 
editorial amendments are made to section 4.4 of the 
SmPC and to the Package Leaflet. The RMP version

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
especially during fasting period (e.g. poor oral food intake, 
infection, vomiting), when glucose demands are increased 
(cold, stress, infections), or in case of overdose. Prescribers 
should inform carers/parents on the risk of serious 
hypoglycaemia that remains equally prominent throughout 
the whole treatment period and emphasize the need to 
respect the dosing recommendations. Carers should be 
provided guidance on how to recognise the clinical signs of 
hypoglycaemia in order to immediately treat and prevent 
life-threatening situations, contact a doctor or go straight 
to hospital, and discontinue the treatment

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications  
Evrenzo is indicated for treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with roxadustat should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of 
anaemia. All other causes of anaemia should be evaluated prior to initiating therapy with Evrenzo, and 
when deciding to increase the dose.  
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a 
physician’s evaluation of the individual patient’s clinical course and condition is necessary. In addition 
to the presence of symptoms of anaemia, criteria such as rate of fall of haemoglobin (Hb) 
concentration, prior response to iron therapy, and the risk of need of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion 
could be of relevance in the evaluation of the individual patient’s clinical course and condition. 
Posology  
The appropriate dose of roxadustat must be taken orally three times per week and not on consecutive 
days. 
The dose should be individualised to achieve and maintain target Hb levels of 10 to 12 g/dL as 
described below. 
Roxadustat treatment should not be continued beyond 24 weeks of therapy if a clinically meaningful 
increase in Hb levels is not achieved. Alternative explanations for an inadequate response should be 
sought and treated before re-starting Evrenzo.    
Starting dose at treatment initiation  
Adequate iron stores should be ensured prior to initiating treatment. 
Patients not currently treated with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) 
For patients initiating anaemia treatment not previously treated with ESA the recommended starting 
dose of roxadustat is 70 mg three times per week in patients weighing less than 100 kg and 100 mg 
three times per week in patients weighing 100 kg and over. 
Patients converting from an ESA  
Patients currently treated with an ESA can be converted to roxadustat, however, conversion of dialysis 
patients otherwise stable on ESA treatment is only to be considered when there is a valid clinical 
reason (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Conversion of non-dialysis patients otherwise stable on ESA treatment has not been investigated. A 
decision to treat these patients with roxadustat should be based on a benefit-risk consideration for the 
individual patient.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended starting dose of roxadustat is based on the average prescribed ESA dose in the 4 
weeks before conversion (see Table 1). The first roxadustat dose should replace the next scheduled 
dose of the current ESA.

Dose adjustment and Hb monitoring 
The individualised maintenance dose ranges from 20 mg to 400 mg three times per week (see section 
maximum recommended dose). Hb levels should be monitored every two weeks until the desired Hb 
level of 10 to 12 g/dL is achieved and stabilised, and every 4 weeks thereafter, or as clinically 
indicated. 
The dose of roxadustat can be adjusted stepwise up or down from the starting dose 4 weeks after 
treatment start, and every 4 weeks thereafter except if the Hb increases by more than 2 g/dL, in which 
case the dose should be reduced by one step immediately. When adjusting the dose of roxadustat, 
consider the current Hb level and the recent rate of change in Hb level over the past 4 weeks, and 
follow the dose adjustment steps according to the dose adjustment algorithm described in Table 2. 
The stepwise dose adjustments up or down should follow the sequence of the available doses:  
20 mg-40 mg-50 mg-70 mg-100 mg-150 mg-200 mg-250 mg-300 mg-400 mg (only for CKD patients 
on dialysis).

The dose of roxadustat should not be adjusted more frequently than once every 4 weeks, except 
if Hb increases by more than 2 g/dL at any time within a 4-week period, in which case the dose 
should be reduced by one step immediately.

If additional dose reduction is required for a patient already on the lowest dose (20 mg three times per 
week), do not reduce the 20 mg dose by breaking the tablet, but reduce the dose frequency to twice per 
week. If further dose reduction is needed, the dose frequency may be further reduced to once weekly. 
Maintenance dose 
After stabilisation to target Hb levels between 10 to 12 g/dL, the Hb levels should continue to be 
monitored regularly and the dose adjustment rules followed (see Table 2).   
Patients starting dialysis while on roxadustat treatment 
No specific dose adjustment is required for CKD patients who start dialysis while on treatment with 
roxadustat. Normal dose adjustment rules (see Table 2) should be followed. 
Concomitant roxadustat treatment with inducers or inhibitors 
When initiating or discontinuing concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or 
inducers (e.g. rifampicin) of CYP2C8, or inhibitors (e.g. probenecid) of UGT1A9: the Hb levels 
should be monitored routinely and the dose adjustment rules followed (see Table 2; see also sections 
4.5 and 5.2).  
Maximum recommended dose 
Patients not on dialysis do not exceed a roxadustat dose of 3 mg/kg body weight or 300 mg three times 
per week, whichever is lower. 
Patients on dialysis do not exceed a roxadustat dose of 3 mg/kg body weight or 400 mg three times per 
week, whichever is lower. 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, and there is more than 1 day until the next scheduled dose, the missed dose must 
be taken as soon as possible. If one day or less remains before the next scheduled dose, the missed 
dose must be skipped, and the next dose must be taken on the next scheduled day. In each case, the 
regular dosing schedule should be resumed thereafter. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No adjustment of the starting dose is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No adjustment of the starting dose level is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh class A) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
Caution is recommended when prescribing roxadustat to patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
The starting dose is to be reduced by half or to the dose level that is closest to half the starting dose 
when initiating treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). Evrenzo 
is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) as the 
safety and efficacy has not been evaluated in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
Paediatric population  
Safety and efficacy of roxadustat in paediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Evrenzo film-coated tablets are to be taken orally with or without food. Tablets are to be swallowed 
whole and not chewed, broken or crushed due to the absence of clinical data under these conditions, 
and to protect the light-sensitive tablet core from photodegradation. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The tablets should be taken at least 1 hour after administration of phosphate binders (except 
lanthanum) or other medicinal products containing multivalent cations such as calcium, iron, 
magnesium or aluminium (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
4.3 
Contraindications  
Evrenzo is contraindicated in the following conditions: 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, peanut, soya or to any of the excipients listed in section 
6.1. 
Third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
•

4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use  
Cardiovascular and mortality risk 
Overall, the cardiovascular and mortality risk for treatment with roxadustat has been estimated to be 
comparable to the cardiovascular and mortality risk for ESA therapy based on data from direct 
comparison of both therapies (see section 5.1). Since, for patients with anaemia associated with CKD 
and not on dialysis, this risk could not be estimated with sufficient confidence versus placebo, a 
decision to treat these patients with roxadustat should be based on similar considerations that would be 
applied before treating with an ESA. Further, several contributing factors have been identified that 
may impose this risk, including treatment non-responsiveness, and converting stable ESA treated 
dialysis patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). In the case of non-responsiveness, treatment with 
roxadustat should not be continued beyond 24 weeks after the start of treatment (see section 4.2). 
Conversion of dialysis patients otherwise stable on ESA treatment is only to be considered when there 
is a valid clinical reason (see section 4.2). For stable ESA treated patients with anaemia associated 
with CKD and not on dialysis, this risk could not be estimated as these patients have not been studied. 
A decision to treat these patients with roxadustat should be based on a benefit risk consideration for 
the individual patient. 
Thrombotic vascular events 
The reported risk of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) should be carefully weighed against the 
benefits to be derived from treatment with roxadustat particularly in patients with pre-existing risk 
factors for TVE, including obesity and prior history of TVEs (e.g., deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and 
pulmonary embolism [PE]). Deep vein thrombosis was reported as common and pulmonary embolism 
as uncommon amongst the patients in clinical studies. The majority of DVT and PE events were 
serious. 
Vascular access thrombosis (VAT) was reported as very common amongst the CKD patients on 
dialysis in clinical studies (see section 4.8).  
In CKD patients on dialysis, rates of VAT in roxadustat-treated patients were highest in the first 
12 weeks following initiation of treatment, at Hb values more than 12 g/dL and in the setting of Hb 
rise of more than 2 g/dL over 4 weeks. It is recommended to monitor Hb levels and adjust the dose 
using the dose adjustment rules (see Table 2) to avoid Hb levels of more than 12 g/dL and Hb rise of 
more than 2 g/dL over 4 weeks.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of TVEs should be promptly evaluated and treated according to 
standard of care. The decision to interrupt or discontinue treatment should be based on a benefit-risk 
consideration for the individual patient. 
Seizures 
Seizures were reported as common amongst the patients in clinical studies receiving roxadustat (see 
section 4.8). Roxadustat should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures (convulsions 
or fits), epilepsy or medical conditions associated with a predisposition to seizure activity such as 
central nervous system (CNS) infections. The decision to interrupt or discontinue treatment should be 
based on a benefit-risk consideration of the individual patient. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious infections 
The most commonly reported serious infections were pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Patients 
with signs and symptoms of an infection should be promptly evaluated and treated according to 
standard of care.  
Sepsis 
Sepsis was one of the most commonly reported serious infections and included fatal events. Patients 
with signs and symptoms of sepsis (e.g., an infection that spreads throughout the body with low blood 
pressure and the potential for organ failure) should be promptly evaluated and treated according to 
standard of care. 
Secondary hypothyroidism 
Cases of secondary hypothyroidism have been reported with the use of roxadustat (see section 4.8). 
These reactions were reversible upon roxadustat withdrawal. Monitoring of thyroid function is 
recommended as clinically indicated. 
Inadequate response to therapy 
Inadequate response to therapy with roxadustat should prompt a search for causative factors. Nutrient 
deficiencies should be corrected. Intercurrent infections, occult blood loss, haemolysis, severe 
aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases or bone marrow fibrosis may also compromise 
the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of the evaluation. If 
typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, an examination of 
the bone marrow should be considered. In the absence of an addressable cause for an inadequate 
response to therapy, Evrenzo should not be continued beyond 24 weeks of therapy. 
Hepatic impairment 
Caution is warranted when roxadustat is administered to patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh class B). Evrenzo is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh class C) (see section 5.2). 
Pregnancy and contraception 
Roxadustat should not be initiated in women planning on becoming pregnant, during pregnancy or 
when anaemia associated with CKD is diagnosed during pregnancy. In such cases, alternative therapy 
should be started, if appropriate. If pregnancy occurs while roxadustat is being administered, treatment 
should be discontinued and alternative treatment started, if appropriate. Women of childbearing 
potential must use highly effective contraception during treatment and for at least one week after the 
last dose of Evrenzo (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Misuse 
Misuse may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This may be associated with 
life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. 
Excipients 
Evrenzo contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Evrenzo contains Allura Red AC aluminium lake (see section 6.1) which may cause allergic reactions. 
Evrenzo contains traces of soya lecithin. Patients who are allergic to peanut or soya, should not use 
this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Effect of other medicinal products on roxadustat 
Phosphate binders and other products containing multivalent cations 
Co-administration of roxadustat with phosphate binders sevelamer carbonate or calcium acetate in 
healthy subjects decreased roxadustat AUC by 67% and 46% and Cmax by 66% and 52%, respectively. 
Roxadustat may form a chelate with multivalent cations such as in phosphate binders or other products 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
containing calcium, iron, magnesium or aluminium. Staggered administration of phosphate binders (at 
least 1 hour apart) had no clinically significant effect on roxadustat exposure in patients with CKD. 
Roxadustat should be taken at least 1 hour after administration of phosphate binders or other medicinal 
products or supplements containing multivalent cations (see section 4.2). This restriction does not 
apply to lanthanum carbonate, as the co-administration of roxadustat with lanthanum carbonate did not 
result in a clinically meaningful change in the plasma exposure of roxadustat. 
Modifiers of CYP2C8 or UGT1A9 activity 
Roxadustat is a substrate of CYP2C8 and UGT1A9. Co-administration of roxadustat with gemfibrozil 
(CYP2C8 and OATP1B1inhibitor) or probenecid (UGT and OAT1/OAT3 inhibitor) in healthy 
subjects increased roxadustat AUC by 2.3-fold and Cmax by 1.4-fold. Monitor Hb levels when initiating 
or discontinuing concomitant treatment with gemfibrozil, probenecid, other strong inhibitors or 
inducers of CYP2C8 or other strong inhibitors of UGT1A9. Adjust the dose of roxadustat following 
dose adjustment rules (see Table 2) based on Hb monitoring.  
Effects of roxadustat on other medicinal products 
OATP1B1 or BCRP Substrates  
Roxadustat is an inhibitor of BCRP and OATP1B1. These transporters play an important role in the 
intestinal and hepatic uptake and efflux of statins. Co-administration of 200 mg of roxadustat with 
simvastatin in healthy subjects increased the AUC and Cmax of simvastatin 1.8- and 1.9-fold, 
respectively, and the AUC and Cmax of simvastatin acid (the active metabolite of simvastatin) 1.9- and 
2.8-fold, respectively. The concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid also increased when 
simvastatin was administered 2 hours before or 4 or 10 hours after roxadustat. Co-administration of 
200 mg of roxadustat with rosuvastatin increased the AUC and Cmax of rosuvastatin 2.9- and 4.5-fold, 
respectively. Co-administration of 200 mg of roxadustat with atorvastatin increased the AUC and Cmax 
of atorvastatin 2.0- and 1.3-fold, respectively. 
Interactions are also expected with other statins. When co-administered with roxadustat, consider this 
interaction, monitor for adverse reactions associated with statins and for the need of statin dose 
reduction. Refer to statin prescribing information when deciding on the appropriate statin dose for 
individual patients.  
Roxadustat may increase the plasma exposure of other medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP 
or OATP1B1. Monitor for possible adverse reactions of co-administered medicinal products and adjust 
dose accordingly. 
Roxadustat and ESAs 
It is not recommended to combine administration of roxadustat and ESAs as the combination has not 
been studied. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy, women of childbearing potential and contraception  
There are no data on the use of roxadustat in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Roxadustat is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Roxadustat is not recommended during the first and second trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).  
If pregnancy occurs while Evrenzo is being administered, treatment should be discontinued and 
switched to alternative treatments, if appropriate (see section 4.3).  
Breast-feeding  
It is unknown whether roxadustat/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available animal data have 
shown excretion of roxadustat in milk (for details see section 5.3). Evrenzo is contraindicated during 
breast-feeding (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility  
In animal studies, there were no effects of roxadustat on male and female fertility. However, changes 
in rat male reproductive organs were observed. The potential effects of roxadustat on male fertility in 
humans is currently unknown. At a maternally toxic dose, increased embryonic loss was observed (see 
section 5.3). Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception during 
treatment and for at least one week after the last dose of Evrenzo. 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Roxadustat has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Seizures have been reported 
during treatment with Evrenzo (see section 4.4). Therefore, caution should be exercised when driving 
or using machines. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Evrenzo was evaluated in 3542 non-dialysis dependent (NDD) and 3353 dialysis 
dependent (DD) patients with anaemia and CKD who have received at least one dose of roxadustat. 
The most frequent (≥10%) adverse reactions associated with roxadustat are hypertension (13.9%), 
vascular access thrombosis (12.8%), diarrhoea (11.8%), peripheral oedema (11.7%), hyperkalaemia 
(10.9%) and nausea (10.2%). 
The most frequent (≥1%) serious adverse reactions associated with roxadustat were sepsis (3.4%), 
hyperkalaemia (2.5%), hypertension (1.4%) and deep vein thrombosis (1.2%).

roxadustat. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Thrombotic vascular events 
In CKD patients not on dialysis, DVT events were uncommon, occurring in 1.0% (0.6 patients with 
events per 100 patient years of exposure) in the roxadustat group, and 0.2% (0.2 patients with events 
per 100 patient years of exposure) in the placebo group. In CKD patients on dialysis, DVT events 
occurred in 1.3% (0.8 patients with events per 100 patient years of exposure) in the roxadustat group 
and 0.3% (0.1 patients with events per 100 patient years of exposure) in the ESA group (see section

In CKD patients not on dialysis, pulmonary embolism was observed in 0.4% (0.2 patients with events 
per 100 patient years of exposure) in the roxadustat group, compared to 0.2% (0.1 patients with events 
per 100 patient years of exposure) in the placebo group. In CKD patients on dialysis, pulmonary 
embolism was observed in 0.6% (0.3 patients with events per 100 patient years of exposure) in the 
roxadustat group, compared to 0.5% (0.3 patients with events per 100 patient years of exposure) in the 
ESA group (see section 4.4). 
In CKD patients on dialysis, vascular access thrombosis was observed in 12.8% (7.6 patients with 
events per 100 patient years of exposure) in the roxadustat group, compared to 10.2% (5.4 patients 
with events per 100 patient years of exposure) in the ESA group (see section 4.4). 
Seizures 
In CKD patients not on dialysis, seizures occurred in 1.1% (0.6 patients with events per 100 patient 
years of exposure) in the roxadustat group, and 0.2% (0.2 patients with events per 100 patient years of 
exposure) in the placebo group (see section 4.4).

Single supratherapeutic doses of roxadustat 5 mg/kg (up to 510 mg) in healthy subjects were 
associated with a transient increase in heart rate, an increased frequency of mild to moderate 
musculoskeletal pain, headaches, sinus tachycardia, and less commonly, low blood pressure, all these 
findings were non-serious. Roxadustat overdose can elevate Hb levels above the desired level 
(10 - 12 g/dL), which should be managed with discontinuation or reduction of roxadustat dosage (see 
section 4.2) and careful monitoring and treatment as clinically indicated. Roxadustat and its 
metabolites are not significantly removed by haemodialysis (see section 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-anaemic preparations, other anti-anaemic preparations, ATC code: 
B03XA05. 
Mechanism of action  
Roxadustat is a hypoxia-inducible factor, prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI). The activity of 
HIF-PH enzymes controls intracellular levels of HIF, a transcription factor that regulates the 
expression of genes involved in erythropoiesis. Activation of the HIF pathway is important in the 
adaptative response to hypoxia to increase red blood cell production. Through the reversible inhibition 
of HIF-PH, roxadustat stimulates a coordinated erythropoietic response that includes the increase of 
plasma endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) levels, regulation of iron transporter proteins and reduction 
of hepcidin (an iron regulator protein that is increased during inflammation in CKD). This results in 
improved iron bioavailability, increased Hb production and increased red cell mass. 
Pharmacodynamic effects  
Effects on QTc and heart rate  
A thorough QT (TQT) study in healthy subjects with roxadustat at a single therapeutic dose of  
2.75 mg/kg and a single supratherapeutic dose of 5 mg/kg (up to 510 mg) did not show a prolongation 
of the QTc interval. The same thorough QT study demonstrated a placebo-corrected heart rate increase 
of up to 9 to 10 bpm at 8 to 12 h post-dose for the 2.75 mg/kg dose and 15 to 18 bpm at 6 to 12 h 
post-dose for the dose of 5 mg/kg. 
Clinical efficacy and safety  
Development program in anaemia with CKD 
Efficacy and safety of roxadustat were evaluated for at least 52 weeks in a globally conducted phase 3 
program comprising of 8 multicentre and randomized studies in non-dialysis dependent (NDD) and 
dialysis-dependent (DD) CKD patients with anaemia (see Table 4).  
Three studies in stage 3-5 CKD NDD patients were double-blind and placebo-controlled studies 
(ALPS, 1517-CL-0608; ANDES, FGCL-4592-060; OLYMPUS, D5740C00001) and one study was 
open-label ESA-controlled (DOLOMITES, 1517-CL-0610) using darbepoetin alfa as comparator. All 
NDD studies assessed efficacy and safety in ESA-untreated patients by correcting and thereafter 
maintaining Hb in the target range of 10 to 12 g/dL (Hb correction setting). 
Four open-label ESA-controlled DD studies (control: epoetin alfa and/or darbepoetin alfa) in patients 
on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis assessed the efficacy and safety in different settings: 
• 
• 
• 
in a Hb correction setting (HIMALAYAS, FGCL-4592-063). 
in an ESA conversion setting converting patients from treatment with an ESA to maintain Hb in 
the target range (PYRENEES, 1517-CL-0613; SIERRAS, FGCL-4592-064). 
or combining the Hb correction and ESA conversion approaches (ROCKIES, D5740C00002). 
Patients in the NDD studies had CKD stage 3 to 5 and were not receiving dialysis. All patients had an 
average Hb ≤10.0 g/dL except patients in the DOLOMITES study (1517-CL-0610), which allowed an 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
average Hb ≤10.5 g/dL. Ferritin levels were required to be ≥30 ng/mL (ALPS, 1517-CL-0608; 
ANDES, FGCL-4592-060), ≥50 ng/mL (OLYMPUS, D5740C00001) or ≥100 ng/mL (DOLOMITES, 
1517-CL-0610). Except for those in the (OLYMPUS, D5740C00001) study, which allowed ESA 
treatment until 6 weeks prior to randomization, patients could not have received any ESA treatment 
within 12 weeks of randomization.  
Patients in the DD studies had to be on dialysis: stable DD for patients in the PYRENEES study 
(1517-CL-0613), which was defined as dialysis for longer than 4 months; or incident (ID), DD for 
patients in the HIMALAYAS study (FGCL-4592-063), which was defined as dialysis ≥2 weeks but 
≤4 months. Patients in the SIERRAS (FGCL-4592-064) and ROCKIES studies (D5740C00002) 
included both stable (approximately 80% to 90%) and ID (approximately 10% to 20%) DD patients. 
Ferritin was required to be ≥100 ng/mL in all patients. All patients required intravenous or 
subcutaneous ESA for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization, except those patients in the 
HIMALAYAS study (FGCL-4592-063) which excluded patients who had received any ESA treatment 
within 12 weeks prior to randomization. 
Treatment with roxadustat followed the principles of dosing instructions as described in section 4.2. 
Demographics and all baseline characteristics across individual studies were comparable between the 
roxadustat and control groups. The median age at randomization was 55 to 69 years, with between 
16.6% and 31.1% in the 65-74 age range, and between 6.8% and 35% who were ≥75 years of age. The 
percentage of female patients ranged from 40.5% to 60.7%. The most commonly represented races 
across the studies were White, Black or African American and Asian. The most common CKD 
aetiologies were diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy. Median Hb levels ranged from 8.60 to 
10.78 g/dL. Approximately 50-60% of NDD patients and 80-90% of DD patients were iron replete at 
baseline. 
Data from seven phase 3 studies were pooled in two separate populations (three NDD and four DD) 
(see Table 4). 
Three placebo-controlled NDD Studies (2,386 patients on roxadustat; 1,884 patients on placebo) were 
included in the NDD pool. Data from the phase 3 ESA-controlled NDD DOLOMITES study 
(1517-CL-0610; 323 patients on roxadustat and 293 patients on darbepoetin alfa) are not included in 
the NDD pooled analyses as this study is the only open-label, active-controlled study in the NDD 
population. 
Four ESA-controlled DD Studies (2,354 patients on roxadustat; 2,360 patients on ESA [epoetin alfa 
and/or darbepoetin alfa]) were included in the DD pool. Within the DD pool, two sub pools were 
established to reflect the two different treatment settings: 
•  Patients in the DD population who were on dialysis for greater than 2 weeks and less than 4 
months were termed incident (ID) DD patients (ID DD pool) reflective of the Hb correction 
setting. 
•  The DD patients who were on dialysis after this threshold of four months were termed stable DD 
patients (Stable DD pool) reflective of the ESA conversion setting.

Key Hb efficacy endpoints in NDD CKD patients 
In NDD patients in need of anaemia treatment for Hb correction, the proportion of patients who 
achieved Hb response during the first 24 weeks was higher in the roxadustat group (80.2%) compared 
with placebo (8.7%). There was a statistically significant increase in Hb from baseline to weeks 28 to 
36 in the roxadustat group (1.91 g/dL) compared with placebo (0.14 g/dL) and the lower limit of the 
95% confidence interval is above 1. In the NDD studies, an increase in Hb of at least 1 g/dL was 
achieved with a median time of 4.1 weeks (see Table 5). 
In the open-label ESA-controlled NDD DOLOMITES (1517-CL-0610) study, the proportion of 
patients who achieved Hb response during the first 24 weeks was non-inferior in the roxadustat group 
(89.5%) compared with darbepoetin alfa (78%) (see Table 5).

Key Hb efficacy endpoints in DD CKD patients 
In DD patients in need of anaemia treatment for Hb correction and those converted from ESA 
treatment, there was an increase in Hb from baseline to weeks 28 to 36 in the roxadustat group; this 
increase was comparable to that observed in the ESA group and was above the prespecified 
noninferiority margin of -0.75 g/dL. The proportion of patients who achieved Hb response during the 
first 24 weeks was similar in the roxadustat and ESA groups (see Table 6).

Rescue therapy, RBC transfusion and intravenous iron 
The effects of treatment with roxadustat on use of rescue therapy, RBC transfusion and intravenous 
iron are presented in Table 7 (NDD) and Table 8 (DD). In clinical studies, roxadustat reduced hepcidin 
(regulator of iron metabolism), reduced ferritin, increased serum iron while transferrin saturation was 
stable, all which were assessed over time as indicators of iron status. 
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 
The effects of treatment with roxadustat on LDL cholesterol are presented in Tables 7 and 8. There 
was a reduction in mean LDL and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in roxadustat-
treated patients compared with placebo or ESA-treated patients. The effect on LDL cholesterol was 
more pronounced, leading to a reduction of the LDL/HDL ratio and was observed regardless of the use 
of statins.

Clinical safety 
Meta-analysis of pooled, adjudicated cardiovascular events 
A meta-analysis, of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; a composite of all-cause 
mortality [ACM], myocardial infarction, stroke) and MACE+ (a composite of ACM, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and hospitalisation for either unstable angina or congestive heart failure), from the 
phase 3 study program was conducted in 8984 patients. 
MACE, MACE+ and ACM outcomes are presented for three datasets using the pooled hazard ratio 
(HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The three datasets include: 
•  A pooled placebo-controlled Hb correction dataset in NDD patients [includes patients from 
studies OLYMPUS (D5740C00001), ANDES (FGCL-4592-060) and ALPS (1517-CL-0608); 
see Table 4] 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  A pooled ESA-controlled Hb correction dataset in NDD and ID-DD patients [includes patients 
from studies DOLOMITES (1517-CL-0610), HIMALAYAS (FGCL-4592-063), and the 
ID-DD patients of studies SIERRAS (FGCL-4592-064) and ROCKIES (D5740C00002); see 
Table 4] 
•  A pooled ESA-controlled ESA conversion dataset in Stable DD patients [includes patients 
from study PYRENEES (1517-CL-0613) and Stable DD patients from studies ROCKIES 
(D5740C00002) and SIERRAS (FGCL-4592-064); see Table 4] 
MACE, MACE+ and ACM in the placebo-controlled Hb correction set of non-dialysis-dependent CKD 
patients 
In NDD patients the analysis for MACE, MACE+ and ACM of the on-treatment analyses included all 
data from the start of study treatment until 28 days of the end of treatment follow-up. The on-treatment 
analyses used a Cox model weighted inversely for the probability of censoring (IPCW method) which 
aims to correct for follow-up time differences between roxadustat and placebo including identified 
contributors to increased risk and early discontinuation, in particular estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) determinants and Hb at baseline and over time. Whether any residual confounding is 
present with this model remains uncertain. The HRs for the on-treatment analyses were 1.26, 1.17 and 
1.16 (see Table 9). The ITT analyses included all data from the start of study treatment until the end of 
posttreatment safety follow-up. The ITT analysis has been included to illustrate an imbalance in risk 
distribution favouring placebo in the on-treatment analysis, however, ITT analyses generally 
demonstrate a dilution of study drug treatment effect and in these ITT analyses bias cannot be 
completely excluded, especially as ESA rescue therapy was introduced after study treatment 
discontinuation. The HRs were 1.10, 1.07 and 1.08, with upper limits of the 95% CIs of 1.27, 1.21 and 
1.26, respectively.

MACE, MACE+ and ACM in the ESA-controlled Hb correction set of non-dialysis-dependent and 
incident dialysis-dependent CKD patients 
In the Hb correction setting of NDD and ID-DD patients baseline characteristics and treatment 
discontinuation rates were comparable between the pooled roxadustat and pooled ESA patients. The 
analysis for MACE, MACE+ and ACM observed on treatment showed HRs of 0.79, 0.78 and 0.78, 
with upper limits of the 95% CIs of 1.02, 0.98 and 1.05, respectively (see Table 10). The on-treatment 
analyses support no evidence of increased cardiovascular safety or mortality risk with roxadustat 
compared with ESA in CKD patients requiring Hb correction.

MACE, MACE+ and ACM in ESA-controlled ESA conversion set of stable dialysis-dependent CKD 
patients 
In stable DD patients converting from ESA analysis results for MACE, MACE+ and ACM observed 
on treatment showed HRs of 1.18, 1.03 and 1.23, with upper limits of the 95% CIs for HRs of 1.38, 
1.19 and 1.49, respectively (see Table 11). The results in Table 11 should be interpreted with caution 
as patients allocated to roxadustat were switched from ESA at the start of the study and the impact of 
an inherent risk in switching to any new treatment versus remaining on a treatment with a stabilised 
Hb may confound the observed results and thus any comparison of treatment effect estimates cannot 
be reliably established.

Pharmacokinetic properties  
5.2 
Roxadustat plasma exposure (area under the plasma drug concentration over time curve [AUC] and 
maximum plasma concentrations [Cmax]) is dose-proportional within the recommended therapeutic 
dose range. In a three times per week dosing regimen, steady-state roxadustat plasma concentrations 
are achieved within one week (3 doses) with minimal accumulation. The pharmacokinetics of 
roxadustat do not change over time. 
Absorption  
Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are usually achieved at 2 hours post dose in the fasted state. 
Administration of roxadustat with food decreased Cmax by 25% but did not alter AUC as compared 
with the fasted state. Therefore, roxadustat can be taken with or without food (see section 4.2). 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution  
Roxadustat is highly bound to human plasma proteins (approximately 99%), predominantly to 
albumin. The blood-to-plasma ratio of roxadustat is 0.6. The apparent volume of distribution at steady 
state is 24 L. 
Biotransformation  
Based on in vitro data, roxadustat is a substrate for CYP2C8 and UGT1A9 enzymes, as well as BCRP, 
OATP1B1, OAT1 and OAT3. Roxadustat is not a substrate for OATP1B3 or P-gp. Roxadustat is 
primarily metabolised to hydroxy-roxadustat and roxadustat-O-glucuronide. Unchanged roxadustat 
was the major circulating component in human plasma; no detectable metabolite in human plasma 
constituted more than 10% of total drug-related material exposure and no human specific metabolites 
were observed. 
Elimination  
The mean effective half-life (t1/2) of roxadustat is approximately 15 hours in patients with CKD. 
The apparent total body clearance (CL/F) of roxadustat is 1.1 L/h in patients with CKD not on dialysis 
and 1.4 L/h in patients with CKD on dialysis. Roxadustat and its metabolites are not significantly 
removed by haemodialysis.  
When radiolabelled roxadustat was administered orally in healthy subjects, the mean recovery of 
radioactivity was 96% (50% in faeces, 46% in urine). In faeces, 28% of the dose was excreted as 
unchanged roxadustat. Less than 2% of the dose was recovered in urine as unchanged roxadustat. 
Special Populations   
Effects of age, sex, body weight, and race 
No clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of roxadustat were observed based on 
age (≥18), sex, race, body weight, renal function (eGFR) or dialysis status in adult patients with 
anaemia due to CKD.  
Haemodialysis  
In dialysis-dependent CKD patients, no marked differences in pharmacokinetic parameter values were 
observed when roxadustat was administered 2 hours before or 1 hour after haemodialysis. Dialysis is a 
negligible route of overall clearance of roxadustat.  
Hepatic impairment  
Following a single dose of 100 mg roxadustat, mean roxadustat AUC was 23% higher and mean Cmax 
was 16% lower in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and normal renal 
function compared to subjects with normal hepatic and renal functions. Subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and normal renal function showed an increase in unbound 
roxadustat AUCinf (+70%) as compared to healthy subjects. 
The pharmacokinetics of roxadustat in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) 
have not been studied. 
Drug-Drug Interactions 
Based on in vitro data, roxadustat is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OAT3 (see 
section 4.5). The pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone (moderate sensitive CYP2C8 substrate) were not 
affected by co-administration of roxadustat. Roxadustat may be an inhibitor of intestinal but not 
hepatic UGT1A1 and showed no inhibition of other CYP metabolising enzymes or transporters, or 
induction of CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. There is no clinically significant effect 
of oral adsorptive charcoal or omeprazole on roxadustat pharmacokinetics. Clopidogrel has no effect 
on roxadustat exposure in patients with CKD. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies 
In the 26-week intermittent repeat dose study in Sprague-Dawley or Fisher rats, roxadustat at 
approximately 4 to 6-fold the total AUC at Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) resulted 
in histopathological findings including aortic and atrioventricular valves (A-V) valvulopathies. These 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
findings were present in surviving animals at the time of termination as well as in animals terminated 
early in a moribund state. Furthermore, the findings were not fully reversible as they were also present 
in animals at the end of a 30-day recovery period. 
Exaggerated pharmacology resulting in excessive erythropoiesis has been observed in repeated-dose 
toxicity studies in healthy animals. 
Haematological changes such as decreases in circulating platelets as well as increases in activated 
partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were noted in rats from approximately 2-fold the 
total AUC at MRHD. Thrombi were noted in the bone marrow (systemic exposures of approximately 
7-fold the total AUC at MRHD in rats), kidneys (systemic exposures of approximately 5 to 6-fold total 
AUC at MRHD in rats), lungs (systemic exposures approximately 8- and 2-fold total AUC at MRHD 
in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, respectively), and the heart (systemic exposures of approximately 4 
to 6-fold the total AUC at MRHD in rats).  
Brain safety 
In the 26-week intermittent repeat dose study in Sprague-Dawley rats, one animal, at approximately 6-
fold the total AUC at MRHD showed a histologic finding of brain necrosis and gliosis. In Fisher rats, 
treated for the same duration, brain/hippocampal necrosis was noted in a total of four animals at the 
approximately 3 to 5-fold the total AUC at MRHD. 
Cynomolgus monkeys intermittently administered roxadustat for 22 or 52-weeks, did not show similar 
findings at systemic exposures up to approximately 2-fold the total AUC at MRHD. 
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity 
Roxadustat was negative in the in vitro Ames mutagenicity test, in vitro chromosome aberration test in 
human peripheral blood lymphocytes and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice at 40-fold the MRHD 
based on a human equivalent dose.  
In the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies, animals were administered roxadustat with the clinical 
dosing regimen of three times per week. Due to the rapid clearance of roxadustat in rodents, systemic 
exposures were not continuous throughout the dosing period. As such, possible off-target carcinogenic 
effects may be underestimated. 
In the 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study, significant increases in the incidence of lung 
bronchoalveolar carcinoma was noted in the low and high dose groups (systemic exposures 
approximately 1-fold and approximately 3-fold the total AUC at MRHD). A significant increase in 
subcutis fibrosarcoma was seen in females at the high dose group (systemic exposures approximately 
3-fold total AUC at MRHD). 
In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, a significant increase in the incidence of mammary gland 
adenoma was noted at the middle dose level (systemic exposure less than 1-fold the total AUC at 
MRHD). However, the finding was not dose related and the incidence of this tumour type was lower at 
the highest dose level tested (systemic exposure approximately 2-fold the total AUC at MRHD) and 
was therefore not considered test article related.  
Similar findings from the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies were not observed in the clinical 
studies. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Roxadustat had no effect on mating or fertility in treated male or female rats at approximately 4-fold 
the human exposure at the MRHD. However, at the NOAEL in male rats, there were decreases in 
weights of the epididymis and the seminal vesicles (with fluid) without effects on male fertility. The 
NOEL for any male reproductive organ related findings was 1.6-fold MRHD. In female rats there were 
increases in the number of non-viable embryos and post-implantation losses at this dose level 
compared to control animals. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results from the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated 
reduction of average foetal or pup body weight, average placental weight increase, abortion and pup 
mortalities. 
Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats administered roxadustat daily from implantation through the closure of 
the hard palate (Gestation Days 7 – 17) showed decreased foetal body weight and increased skeletal 
alterations at approximately 6-fold the total AUC at MRHD. Roxadustat had no effect on post-implant 
foetal survival.   
Pregnant New Zealand rabbits were administered roxadustat daily from Gestation Day 7 through 
Gestation Day 19 and Caesarian sections were performed on Gestation Day 29. Roxadustat 
administration at systemic exposures up to approximately 3-fold the total AUC at MRHD showed no 
embryo-foetal findings. However, one doe aborted at approximately 1-fold the total AUC at MRHD 
and 2 does aborted at approximately 3-fold the total AUC at MRHD, the aborting females showed thin 
body condition. 
In the perinatal/postnatal development study in Sprague-Dawley rats, pregnant dams were 
administered roxadustat daily from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20. During the lactation period, 
pups from dams administered roxadustat at approximately 2-fold the total Cmax at MRHD showed high 
mortality during the preweaning period and were sacrificed at weaning. Pups from dams administered 
roxadustat at doses resulting in systemic exposures approximately 3-fold the human exposure at 
MRHD showed a significant decrease in 21-day survival after birth (lactation index) compared with 
pups from control litters.  
In a cross-fostering study, the most pronounced effects on rat pup viability were noted in the pups 
exposed to roxadustat postnatally only, and the pup viability exposed to roxadustat until delivery was 
lower than that of unexposed pups. 
The cross-fostering study in which pups from unexposed rats were cross fostered with dams treated 
with roxadustat (human equivalent dose approximately 2-fold MRHD), had roxadustat in pup plasma 
indicating transfer of drug via the milk. Milk from these dams had roxadustat present. The pups who 
were exposed to milk containing roxadustat showed a lower survival rate (85.1%) versus pups from 
untreated dams cross fostered with untreated dams (98.5% survival rate). The mean body weight of the 
surviving pups exposed to roxadustat during the lactation period was also less than the control pups 
(no in utero exposure – no exposure in milk).   
Cardiovascular safety 
A cardiovascular safety pharmacology study showed heart rate increases following a single 
administration of 100 mg/kg roxadustat to monkeys. There was no effect on hERG or ECG. Additional 
safety pharmacology studies in rats have shown that roxadustat reduced total peripheral resistance 
followed by a reflex increase in heart rate from approximately six times the exposure at the MRHD.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Evrenzo is and what it is used for 
What Evrenzo is 
Evrenzo is a medicine that increases the number of red blood cells and haemoglobin level in your 
blood. It contains the active substance roxadustat. 
What Evrenzo is used for 
Evrenzo is used to treat adults with symptomatic anaemia that occurs in patients with chronic kidney 
disease. Anaemia is when you have too few red blood cells and your haemoglobin level is too low. As 
a result, your body might not receive enough oxygen. Anaemia can cause symptoms such as tiredness, 
weakness, or shortness of breath. 
How Evrenzo works 
Roxadustat, the active substance in Evrenzo, works by increasing the level of HIF, a substance in the 
body which increases the production of red blood cells when oxygen levels are low. By raising HIF 
levels, the medicine increases the production of red blood cells and raises the levels of haemoglobin 
(the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells). This improves the oxygen supply to your body and 
may reduce your symptoms of anaemia. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take Evrenzo 
Do not take Evrenzo 
• 
if you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicine. Evrenzo contains soya lecithin. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to roxadustat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are more than 6 months pregnant (it is also better to avoid this medicine in early 
pregnancy - see pregnancy section). 
if you are breast-feeding.  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, or pharmacist before taking Evrenzo: 
• 
• 
• 
if you have epilepsy or have ever had convulsions or fits. 
if you have signs and symptoms of an infection, which may include fever, sweating or chills, 
sore throat, runny nose, shortness of breath, feeling weak, confusion, cough, vomiting, diarrhoea 
or stomach pain, feeling of burning when you pass urine, red or painful skin or sores on your 
body. 
if you have a liver disorder. 
Chronic kidney disease and anaemia may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and death. 
Managing your anaemia is important. Your doctor will monitor your haemoglobin and also consider 
your treatment regimen as anaemia treatment and switching between anaemia treatments may also 
have a negative impact on your cardiovascular health. 
Talk to your doctor, or pharmacist straight away: 
• 
if you get blood clots: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT), signs of which can include pain 
and/or swelling in the legs, cramping or a feeling of warmth in the affected leg; 
in the lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE), signs of which can include sudden shortness of 
breath, chest pain (usually worse with breathing), feeling of anxiety, dizziness, light-
headedness, or fainting; heart racing, coughing (sometimes with blood); 
in your haemodialysis access (vascular access thrombosis or VAT) that stop the vascular 
access from working; signs of this can include swelling, redness, hardening or thickening 
of the skin around your access, oozing at the access site, not feeling a vibration (“thrill”) 
over the access area; 
• 
• 
if you have a seizure (convulsion or fit) or possible warning signs that a seizure may occur, such 
as headache, irritability, fear, confusion or unusual feelings; 
if you have signs and symptoms of an infection, which include fever, sweating or chills, sore 
throat, runny nose, shortness of breath, feeling weak or faint, confusion, cough, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, or stomach pain, burning when you pass urine, red or painful skin or sores on your 
body. 
Misuse can lead to an increase in blood cells and consequently thicken the blood. This can cause life-
threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give Evrenzo to children and adolescents aged under 18 years because there is not enough 
information about its use in this age group. 
Other medicines and Evrenzo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. Evrenzo may affect the way these medicines work, or these medicines may affect how 
Evrenzo works.

• 
medicines to reduce phosphate levels in your blood (called phosphate binders) or other 
medicines or supplements that contain calcium, iron, magnesium or aluminium (called 
multivalent cations), such as sevelamer carbonate or calcium acetate. You must take Evrenzo at 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
least 1 hour after these medicines or supplements. Otherwise roxadustat will not be properly 
absorbed by your body. 
a medicine to treat gout called probenecid. 
medicines used to lower cholesterol, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin (also 
called “statins”), or gemfibrozil. 
other medicines used to treat anaemia such as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). 
• 
• 
• 
If you normally take any of these medicines, your doctor might change it and prescribe a different 
medicine for you during your treatment with Evrenzo.

become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception during treatment with Evrenzo and 
for at least one week after the last dose of Evrenzo. If you use a hormonal contraceptive, you must also

breast milk and could harm your baby.

SmPC and PL 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Idacio 
in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

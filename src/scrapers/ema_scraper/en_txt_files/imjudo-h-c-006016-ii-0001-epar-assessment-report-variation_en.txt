The applied indication is: IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy 
is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
with no sensitising epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK) genomic tumour aberrations. 
Epidemiology  
Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and remains the leading cause of cancer 
death around the globe (Sung et al 2021; GLOBOCAN 2021). In Europe, an estimated 312,645 
patients will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2021, accounting for approximately 25% of all cancer 
diagnoses, and an estimated 267,700 lung cancer associated deaths will occur, accounting for 
approximately one in 5 cancer related mortalities (Lung Cancer Europe 2021). In the US, an estimated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 7/134 
 
 
 
 
 
235,760 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in 2021, accounting for about 25% of all cancer 
diagnoses, and an estimated 131,880 lung cancer associated deaths will occur, accounting for 
approximately 1 in 4 cancer related mortalities (American Cancer Society 2021). 
Biologic features 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises approximately 85% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer 
cases. It includes several histological subtypes of which non-squamous (e.g., adenocarcinoma, large 
cell carcinoma) and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common (Aisner and Marshall 2012). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Despite advances made in screening, early detection, and staging, the majority of lung cancer patients 
are diagnosed when the disease has advanced into the metastatic stage and is not amenable to 
surgical resection (Herbst et al 2018). Furthermore, a significant percentage of patients with early 
stage NSCLC who have undergone surgery subsequently develop distant recurrence and die as a result 
of their metastatic disease (Pisters and Le Chevalier 2005). 
Management 
The first line (1L) treatment of metastatic NSCLC has evolved from the empirical use of cytotoxic 
chemotherapies based on physician’s preference to a hallmark of personalized medicine, with subsets 
of patients treated according to the genetic alterations of their tumour and the status of programmed 
cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which predict for benefit from targeted therapies or immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs), respectively (Herbst et al 2018; Peters et al 2019). 
In the past 5 years, substantial progress has been made in the frontline treatment of metastatic 
NSCLC with immunotherapy-based regimens demonstrating improved outcomes in this patient 
population (NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology Version 1.2020; ESMO Guidelines Committee 
2019). Treatment selection in clinical practice is usually based on PD-L1 expression or histology. For 
patients with high PD-L1 expression (i.e., PD-L1 expressed in ≥50% of tumour cells), monotherapy 
with either pembrolizumab or atezolizumab or cemiplimab have been authorised in the EU. Conversely, 
regardless of PD-L1 expression, a series of combinations of immunotherapy with histology-selected 
platinum-based chemotherapy have also shown survival benefits and were authorised in the EU: 
• 
• 
Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel for squamous histology 
Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + pemetrexed for non-squamous histology 
•  Atezolizumab + bevacizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
•  Atezolizumab + carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
The addition of chemotherapy to nivolumab + ipilimumab, a combination of PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitors, 
showed efficacy benefit over chemotherapy alone with early disease control at all PD-L1 expression 
levels (Paz-Ares et al [Checkmate 9LA] 2021), receiving a positive opinion from the CHMP in 
September 2020 (EMEA/H/C/WS1783). 
Unmet medical need: Immunotherapy-based treatments are the 1L standard-of-care in patients with 
advanced metastatic NSCLC whose tumours do not harbour driver mutations (NCCN Clinical Practice 
Guidelines in Oncology Version 2.2021). Notwithstanding these developments and the treatment 
options, the available treatment strategies extend long-term survival in only a minority of patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 8/134 
 
 
 
(Peters et al 2019; Grant et al 2021). Overall, newer treatment options are therefore required that can 
explore the potential of immunotherapy strategies and benefit a broader patient population. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Tremelimumab is a selective, fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against cytotoxic 
T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a critical regulatory signal for T cell expansion 
and activation following an immune response, and it serves as a natural braking mechanism that 
maintains T cell homeostasis. During T cell activation, T cells upregulate CTLA-4, which binds to CD80 
and CD86 ligands on antigen-presenting cells, sending an inhibitory signal and preventing CD28-
mediated T cell co-stimulation, thus limiting T cell activation. Tremelimumab blocks these events, 
leading to prolongation and enhancement of T cell activation and expansion, resulting in increased T-
cell diversity and enhanced anti-tumour activity. 
In order to make the medicinal product available for health-care professionals and/or patients in the 
most optimal and timely way (related to Article 82 (1) of Regulation (EC) № 726/2004) the applicant 
has submitted two separate MAAs for tremelimumab: 
- One MAA, under the name of TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA, in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CHMP opinion issued on 
15 December 2022. 
- Another MAA, under the name of IMJUDO, in combination with durvalumab in the treatment of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CHMP opinion issued on 15 December 2022. 
This type II variation is being submitting to reflect the NSCLC indication from the TREMELIMUMAB 
ASTRAZENECA MAA into the IMJUDO Marketing Authorisation. 
This variation presents a consolidation of the already assessed NSCLC data from the TREMELIMUMAB 
ASTRAZENECA MAA into the IMJUDO MA, together with an administrative update of the eCTD 
backbone. 
The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the following indication: IMJUDO in combination with 
durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK positive 
mutations. 
Treatment with IMJUDO must be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment 
of cancer. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of IMJUDO is presented in Table 1.

1 500 mg and platinum-based 
chemotherapy if there is disease 
progression or unacceptable 
toxicity  
a For IMJUDO, metastatic NSCLC patients with a body weight of 34 kg or less must receive weight-based dosing, 
equivalent to 1 mg/kg of IMJUDO until the weight improves to greater than 34 kg. For durvalumab, patients with a 
body weight of 30 kg or less must receive weight-based dosing, equivalent to durvalumab 20 mg/kg until the 
weight improves to greater than 30 kg. 
b When IMJUDO is administered in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, refer to the 
summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for durvalumab for dosing information. 
c When IMJUDO is administered in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, refer to the 
SmPC for nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, pemetrexed and carboplatin or cisplatin for dosing information. 
d Consider maintenance administration of pemetrexed for patients with non-squamous tumours who received 
treatment with pemetrexed and carboplatin/cisplatin during the platinum-based chemotherapy stage. 
e In the case of dose delay(s), a fifth dose of IMJUDO can be given after Week 16, alongside durvalumab. 
f If patients receive fewer than 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, the remaining cycles of IMJUDO (up to a 
total of 5) should be given during the post-platinum chemotherapy phase. 
Dose escalation or reduction is not recommended for IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab. Dose 
withholding or discontinuation may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. 
Method of administration 
IMJUDO is for intravenous use, it is administered as an intravenous infusion after dilution, over 1 hour. 
When IMJUDO is given in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, IMJUDO is 
given first, followed by durvalumab and then platinum-based chemotherapy on the day of dosing. 
When IMJUDO is given as a fifth dose in combination with durvalumab and pemetrexed maintenance 
therapy at week 16, IMJUDO is given first, followed by durvalumab and then pemetrexed maintenance 
therapy on the day of dosing. 
IMJUDO, durvalumab, and platinum-based chemotherapy are administered as separate intravenous 
infusions. IMJUDO and durvalumab are each given over 1 hour. For platinum-based chemotherapy, 
refer to the SmPC for administration information. For pemetrexed maintenance therapy, refer to the 
SmPC for administration information. Separate infusion bags and filters for each infusion should be 
used. 
During cycle 1, IMJUDO is to be followed by durvalumab starting approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 
hours) after the end of the IMJUDO infusion. Platinum-based chemotherapy infusion should start 
approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the durvalumab infusion. If there are no 
clinically significant concerns during cycle 1, then at the physician’s discretion, subsequent cycles of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 10/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
durvalumab can be given immediately after IMJUDO and the time period between the end of the 
durvalumab infusion and the start of chemotherapy can be reduced to 30 minutes. 
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
A routine GCP inspection of study D419MC00004 (POSEIDON) was adopted at the CHMP meeting held 
in January 2022. No specific concerns were known to have been identified by the assessment at the 
time of adoption of the inspection request; general triggers were used in the choice of this dossier and 
the sites involved in line with the guideline “Points to consider for assessors, inspectors and EMA 
inspection coordinators on the identification of triggers for the selection of applications for “routine” 
and/or “for cause” inspections, their investigation and scope of such inspections”. The purpose of the 
inspection was to verify efficacy and safety data reported by the applicant for a sample of patients to 
be determined by the inspectors. Moreover, the compliance with GCP and applicable regulations was to 
be verified, in particular where it had an impact on the validity of the data or the ethical conduct of the 
study. 
This routine GCP inspection was conducted at one investigational site in Germany (21-25 February 
2022), the main CRO in the USA (11-17 March 2022), and the sponsor in Canada (21-25 March 2022). 
One critical finding was reported during the CRO inspection; major and minor findings were observed 
at all sites. 
Although departures from GCP compliance were identified as there were one critical and several major 
findings observed during the inspections at all sites, the study was considered by the inspection team 
to have been conducted ethically and in compliance with GCP. The findings were deemed unlikely to 
impact the overall quality of the data. The inspection team concluded that the overall quality of the 
trial with the reported data had not been negatively affected, and that the data documented and 
reported in the Clinical Study Report (CSR) submitted could be used as basis for the assessment. The 
sponsor was however requested for a CSR addendum including a complete list of mis-stratified 
subjects to report overall survival in long-term follow up as part of the corrective action proposed for 
one of the major findings at the sponsor site. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Since the two indications for IMJUDO have different clinical dosing regimens, different population PK 
reports are used to calculate safety margins.  
Safety margins are calculated using the clinical AUC from the 6-month cynomolgus monkey study at 
the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD). A clinical AUC value of 19104 µg.hr/mL is used for the 
indication of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab for the treatment of HCC (IMJUDO initial 
MAA) while a clinical AUC value of 6360 µg.hr/mL is used for the indication of tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC 
(TREMELIMUMAB ASTRAZENECA initial MAA). This equates to a safety margin of 1.77 and 5.33 for 
each indication respectively.  
No other new non-clinical data have been submitted to support this application. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 11/134 
 
 
 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Tremelimumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a 
significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), tremelimumab is 
exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not 
pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
In accordance, the section 5.3 of the SmPC has been updated to include a range for the exposure-
based safety margin (1.77-5.33). The non-clinical data submitted in the context of the initial MAA of 
Imjudo also support the intended use in the new indication submitted in this application. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Tremelimumab and durvalumab are human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that act as checkpoint 
inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms of action with respect to enhancing the 
antitumor immune response triggered by chemotherapy. 
In 2018 durvalumab (Imfinzi) was approved in the EU for treatment of adults with locally advanced, 
unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose tumours express PD-L1 on ≥ 1% of tumour 
cells and whose disease had not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. 
The applicant is currently seeking approval for the use of tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic 
NSCLC with no sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The clinical 
pharmacology data that support this proposed indication is summarized below. 
No dedicated human PK studies have been conducted for tremelimumab. The PK of tremelimumab 
and/or durvalumab has been investigated in patients enrolled in:

Three Phase I/Ib studies: D4190C00006 (Study 06), D4190C00010 (Study 10), and 
D4190C00002 (Japan Study 02). 
•  One Phase I/II study: D4190C00022 (Study 22). 
• 
Three Phase II/IIb studies: D4193C00003 (CONDOR), D4880C00003 (DETERMINE), and 
D4884C00001. 
•  Six Phase III studies: D419MC00004 (POSEIDON), D419QC00001 (CASPIAN), D419AC00001 
(MYSTIC), D419AC00003 (NEPTUNE), D4191C00004 (ARCTIC), and D4193C00002 (EAGLE). 
The Phase III study POSEIDON is the pivotal study for this application, while the other studies are 
supportive studies. 
The PK of tremelimumab as monotherapy has been determined in 5 supportive studies (Study 22, 
ARCTIC, CONDOR, DETERMINE, and D4884C00001). In these studies, however, only sparse sampling 
was performed for the assessment of PK. 
Overall, the peak and trough concentrations of tremelimumab were in a similar range across studies at 
the same dosing regimens. 
All studies included male and female patients aged 18 years and older with advanced solid tumors. No 
PK data has been obtained from healthy volunteers.

Dose rationale 
In POSEIDON, a dose of 75 mg Q3W IV tremelimumab in combination with 1500 mg Q3W IV 
durvalumab and SoC for 4 cycles was administered, with one additional dose of tremelimumab 75 mg 
at Week 16, followed by 1500 mg Q4W IV durvalumab monotherapy to disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC with no sensitizing 
EGFR mutations or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. 
The chosen dose was based on the results from the dose finding study (Study 06), in which 
tremelimumab 1 mg/kg was selected, as patients in the 20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg 
tremelimumab group had a tolerable safety profile without dose-limiting toxicities and the dose showed

evidence of clinical activity. There was evidence of augmented pharmacodynamic activity relative to 
durvalumab monotherapy with combination doses containing 1 mg/kg tremelimumab. 
A fixed dose of tremelimumab 75 mg Q4W (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W for an average body weight of 
75 kg) was predicted to result in similar AUC and only a modest difference in median peak and trough 
levels at steady state compared to tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4W based on simulations in a Population 
PK model developed for tremelimumab using data from Study 10, Japan Study 02, Study 06, 
D4884C00001, DETERMINE, and POSEIDON. 
Simulations indicated that both body weight-based and fixed dosing regimens of tremelimumab yield 
similar median steady state PK concentrations with slightly less between-patient variability with the 
fixed dose regimen. 
In order to further evaluate the suitability of a fixed dosing regimen of tremelimumab versus body 
weight-based dosing, tremelimumab exposure was compared by body weight quartiles. The exposure 
difference was small (< 20%) for all metrics (AUC, Cmax, Cmin), with a large overlap between body 
weight brackets (Table 5).

Simulations were conducted to compare the tremelimumab exposure between the 75 mg Q3W dosing 
regimen and 1 mg/kg Q3W dosing regimen in order to evaluate the suitability of a fixed dosing 
regimen of tremelimumab versus body weight-based dosing. Tremelimumab serum concentrations 
were simulated based on the individual Empirical Bayes estimates obtained from the final model for the 
POSEIDON patients. The concentration profiles were summarized over time (Figure 1). The 
concentration profiles showed a good overlap between the 2 dosing regimens.

Bioanalytical Methods 
Bioanalysis methods for quantitation of tremelimumab drug concentration, anti-drug antibodies (ADA), 
and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) were developed and validated. 
Population PK analyses for tremelimumab and durvalumab 
A population PK model was developed for tremelimumab based on a pooled dataset from 6 Studies: 
Study 02, Study 06, Study 10, DETERMINE, BASKET and POSEIDON, which comprised of 5455 serum 
concentrations from 1605 patients. The final Pop PK model of tremelimumab was a 2-compartment 
model with linear CL and an additional time-dependent CL component for patients on combination 
therapy only. The following covariates were identified as statistically significant and included in the 
final model: body weight and sex on both CL and V1; albumin, primary indication and combination 
therapy (chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy) on CL. The effect of body weight was allometrically 
scaled with estimated exponents of 0.370 and 0.453 for CL and V1, respectively, indicating that the

effect of body weight was less than proportional. The final model was evaluated by means of non-
parametric bootstrap analysis (n=1000), RSEs, GOF-plots and pcVPCs. 
The durvalumab PopPK model was updated by including 11683 serum PK samples from 2827 patients. 
The model was based on a pooled dataset from 5 Studies: Study 1108, POSEIDON, ATLANTIC, 
PACIFIC and CASPIAN. The final model of durvalumab PK was a 2-compartment model with time-
dependent CL. Residuals were described by a combined additive and proportional error model. The 
final durvalumab PopPK model included the following statistically significant covariate effects on CL: 
body weight, albumin, combination therapy, sex, creatinine clearance, lactate dehydrogenase, and 
eastern cooperative oncology group; and on V1: body weight and sex. The effect of body weight was 
allometrically scaled with estimated exponents of 0.337 and 0.494 for CL and V1. The final model was 
evaluated by means of non-parametric bootstrap analysis (n=500), RSEs, GOF-plots and pcVPCs.

Tremelimumab & durvalumab exposure-response modelling analyses 
The final PopPK models of tremelimumab and durvalumab were used to derive individual predicted 
exposure metrics for the E-R analyses. The tremelimumab/durvalumab E-R relationship for OS, PFS 
and ORR were analysed using data from POSEIDON, which included 326 patients administered 
tremelimumab (T) + durvalumab (D) + SoC arm. Both OS and PFS were analysed by Kaplan-Meier 
plots stratified by model-predicted exposure metrics and CPH models with T + D + SoC. Cmin of 
tremelimumab following dose 5 and tumour type were statistically significant for OS. 
The parameter estimates from the final OS CPH model are presented in Table 8 and parameter 
estimates from the final PFS CPH model are presented in Table 9. 
The following covariates for PFS were statistically significant: patients having high tumour mutational 
burden (>12 mutations per megabase), high percentage of PD-L1 T cells (<25%), non-squamous 
tumour lesions and low NLR (Q1). Models were evaluated by graphically superimposing model-
predictions over the observed data.

QTcF modelling analysis 
Linear mixed-effects exposure-response modelling with an intercept was conducted to characterize the 
relationship of change from baseline of QTcF (ΔQTcF) with durvalumab or tremelimumab serum 
concentrations. The concentration-ΔQTcF analysis population consisted of 293 observations from 67 
patients administered durvalumab and 254 observations from 66 patients administered tremelimumab 
from Study 06. Unscheduled concentration-QTcF observations and non-central ECG records were 
excluded from the analysis. 
For durvalumab, the slope for the relationship of ΔQTcF to durvalumab concentration was 0.0048 ms 
per μg/mL (p = 0.112), with a mean intercept of 0.082 ms (p = 0.950; 90% CI: -2.24, 2.24 ms; Table 
11). 
The slope or the intercept for tremelimumab and durvalumab were significantly different from 0. The 
slope for the relationship of ΔQTcF to tremelimumab concentration was -0.012 ms per μg/mL (p = 
0.531), and the mean intercept was 0.581 ms (p = 0.629; 90% CI: 1.41, 2.57 ms; Error! Reference

Distribution 
No distribution studies have been conducted in patients with NSCLC. However, Study 22 evaluated PK 
parameters in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, who received a single IV dose of 300 
mg on Day 1. In a subset of patients from this study (N=11): for whom intensive PK sampling was 
done, the estimated volume of distribution was 7.6 L (Table 15). 
Based on population PK analysis that included 1605 patients who received tremelimumab monotherapy 
or in combination with durvalumab with or without chemotherapy in the dose range of ≥ 1 mg/kg, the 
geometric mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was 6.33 L.

parameters following single IV dose of 300 mg tremelimumab on Day 1 of Week 1 to 
patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (PK analysis set) (Study 22) 
Elimination 
Tremelimumab, as a typical mAb, is not cleared renally due to its large molecular weight. The primary 
elimination pathways are protein catabolism via the reticuloendothelial system (RES) or target-
mediated disposition. 
Based on the findings from the subset of patients from Study 22, for whom intensive PK sampling was 
done, the clearance was 0.21 L/day and the apparent half-life (apparent terminal t½) was 25.1 days 
(Table 15). 
Based on population PK analysis, the geometric mean steady-state clearance (CLss) was 0.309 L/day 
and the geometric mean terminal half-life was approximately 14.2 days. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In Study 06 an approximately dose-proportional increase in PK exposure (Cmax and AUC0-28) of 
tremelimumab was observed over the dose range of 1 to 10 mg/kg tremelimumab Q4W when 
administered in combination with durvalumab (Table 14). Exposure following multiple doses 
demonstrated accumulation consistent with PK parameters estimated from the first dose. The PK 
profile for tremelimumab is shown in Figure 8. 
Based on the final Population PK model using POSEIDON data, time-dependent CL was identified for 
tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, but not with tremelimumab monotherapy.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
For tremelimumab, all fixed and random effects were estimated with good precision (< 25% RSE). The 
IIV was 33%, 20%, 46% and 87% for CL, V1, V2 and Tmax, respectively. 
For durvalumab, the IIV was limited, amounting to 28%, 24% and 25% on CL, V1 and Tmax, 
respectively. 
Special populations 
The effect of intrinsic factors (i.e., renal impairment, hepatic impairment, age, race, gender, and body 
weight) on the PK of tremelimumab has not been studied through specific dedicated studies. 
The effect of renal impairment, hepatic impairment, age, race, gender, and body weight on the PK of 
tremelimumab, however, has been evaluated in the Population PK analysis. In summary, the final 
Population PK modeling indicated that the baseline patient characteristics of age, race, renal function, 
and hepatic function had no effect on the PK of tremelimumab. 
In contrast, the Population PK analysis identified several covariates that were statistically significant on 
tremelimumab CL and V1: body weight, serum albumin (ALB), sex, combination therapy and primary 
indication on CL; and body weight and sex on V1, all identified covariates changed tremelimumab 
exposure by less than ± 20% and were regarded as of minor clinical relevance. 
Impaired renal function 
Mild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 ml/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The 
effect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 ml/min) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown.

Impaired hepatic function 
Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) 
had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The effect of moderate hepatic 
impairment (bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3.0 x 
ULN and any AST) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown. 
Gender 
Based on the final PopPK model of tremelimumab, gender was identified as a statistically significant 
covariate on PK of tremelimumab. Based on the final Population PK model using POSEIDON data, the 
geometric mean CLss and V1 values were 13.4% and 14.9% lower, respectively, in female patients 
compared to the respective population mean values. 
These differences in CLss and V1 (< 20%) were not considered clinically meaningful given the lack of 
exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy relationships in POSEIDON.

Race was not identified as a significant covariate in the final PopPK model of tremelimumab and race 
did not seem to influence PK of tremelimumab. 
Weight 
Based on the final PopPK model of tremelimumab, body weight was identified as a statistically 
significant covariate on PK of tremelimumab. The impact of body weight on CLss or V1, evaluated 
based on the difference in geometric mean parameter values at the 95th or 5th percentile of the 
weight distribution from that of the overall population, was within -11.8% to +14.7% for CLss and -
14.2% to +18.3% for V1. 
Table 16 shows the simulated tremelimumab AUC, Cmax, and Cmin at steady state across body weight 
quartiles. At the highest weight quartile, the simulated geometric mean AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss 
decreased by 8.68%, 13.7%, and 7.53%, respectively, compared to the geometric mean of the overall 
population. At the lowest quartile, the simulated AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss increased by 9.12%, 
14.6%, and 10.5%, respectively, compared to the mean of the overall population. 
These differences in exposure were not considered clinically meaningful given the lack of exposure-
efficacy and exposure-safety relationships in POSEIDON.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with tremelimumab or durvalumab. 
In POSEIDON, no clinically meaningful PK drug-drug interactions between tremelimumab or 
durvalumab and SoC were identified. In addition, PK of abraxane and gemcitabine were similar 
between SoC only, durvalumab + SoC, and durvalumab + tremelimumab + SoC groups, suggesting 
that combination with durvalumab and tremelimumab does not have an impact on the PK of abraxane 
and gemcitabine. 
Additionally, based on population PK analysis, concomitant durvalumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy treatment did not seem to impact the PK of tremelimumab in terms of Cmax, CL or AUC. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of 
tremelimumab is based on pooled data in 1337 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg 
or 1 mg/kg and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). One-hundred forty-three 
patients (10.7%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralizing antibodies against 
tremelimumab were detected in 8.9% (119/1337) of patients. 
In the POSEIDON study, of the 278 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg in 
combination with durvalumab 1 500 mg every 3 weeks and platinum-based chemotherapy and 
evaluable for the presence of ADAs, 38 (13.7%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. 
Neutralizing antibodies against tremelimumab were detected in 11.2% (31/278) of patients. Both ADA 
incidence and prevalence were numerically similar between the T + D + SoC and D + SoC arms, 
indicating that the presence of tremelimumab did not have an apparent effect on the immunogenicity 
of durvalumab. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tremelimumab is a human IgG2 mAb directed against cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 
(CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a critical regulatory signal for T-cell expansion and activation following an immune 
response, and it serves as a natural braking mechanism that maintains T-cell homeostasis. During T-
cell activation, T cells upregulate CTLA-4, which binds to CD80 and CD86 ligands on antigen-
presenting cells, sending an inhibitory signal and preventing CD28-mediated T-cell co-stimulation, thus 
limiting T-cell activation. Tremelimumab blocks these events, leading to prolongation and 
enhancement of T-cell activation and expansion. 
Durvalumab is a human IgG1k mAb that binds to programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and blocks 
the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Expression of PD-L1 can be induced by 
inflammatory signals and can be expressed on both tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells 
in the tumuor microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interactions with 
PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, 
and cytokine production. Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition 
of immune responses, without inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
Tremelimumab and durvalumab are checkpoint inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms 
of action with respect to enhancing the antitumor immune response triggered by chemotherapy. 
Tremelimumab mediated blockade of CTLA-4 functions early in the immune response, lowering the 
threshold for T cell activation, allowing more T cells to be activated and increasing the diversity of the 
T cell population. This increases the probability that a T cell recognizing a tumour neoantigen can 
become activated. Durvalumab blockade of PD-L1 is expected to function mainly during the effector 
phase of T cell function, once T cells enter the tumour, where it acts to block local suppression of T-cell 
function by PD-L1, enhancing the ability of activated anti-tumor T cells to target and kill tumour cells.

Data from Study 06, Study 10 and Study 22 indicate that a pharmacodynamic effect exists on 
proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cell quantities consistent with the proposed mechanisms of action of 
both therapeutic agents. 
Data from Study 1108, Japan Study 02, Study 06 and Study 10 indicate that durvalumab treatment 
(with or without tremelimumab) reduces free Soluble Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (sPD-L1) in 
serum. 
No PD biomarkers are proposed for monitoring of effect. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Concentration-QTc Analysis 
Overall, concentration-QTc-analysis did not identify a significant linear relationship between 
tremelimumab or durvalumab serum concentrations and ΔQTcF. The predicted mean ΔQTcF and upper 
90% CI at the maximum observed concentration for tremelimumab or durvalumab in the dataset were 
below the threshold of clinical concern. 
Exposure-response relationships 
Assessment of an exposure-efficacy relationship was conducted using overall survival (OS), 
progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR) as efficacy parameters in patients 
from POSEIDON, for whom the different exposure metrics could be calculated. The total number of 
patients included in the analysis of the exposure-efficacy relationship was 326 receiving T + D + SoC, 
322 receiving D + SoC, and 333 receiving SoC. 
Both OS and PFS were explored by Kaplan-Meier estimates and analyzed by Cox proportional-hazards 
models based on data from patients in the T + D + SoC arm.

For AUCDose 5 Treme, Cmin, Dose 5 Treme, and Cmin, Dose 1 Treme, there was a trend that patients with exposure in 
the 1st quartile had shorter OS compared to those in the 2nd quartile (Figure 9 and Figure 10). 
Similarly, patients in the 2nd quartile had also a shorter OS than those in the 3rd quartile. However, 
no difference was observed between 3rd and 4th quartile. Further, for all quartiles but the 1st, the 
Kaplan-Meier curves of OS were above that of the SoC arm.

In order to assess whether confounding factors could explain the fact that the 1st quartile had a worse 
OS than SoC, a case match analysis was performed (see below).

For AUCDose 5 Treme, Cmin, Dose 5 Treme, and Cmin, Dose 1 Treme, and similarly to what was observed for OS, for 
all quartiles but the 1st, the Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS were above that of the SoC arm (Figure 11 
and Figure 12). 
Exposure-response analyses demonstrated that the Cmin after tremelimumab dose at Cycle 5 was the 
most significant exposure metric that influenced OS and PFS in patients enrolled in the POSEIDON 
study. In addition to tremelimumab exposure, the following covariates also influence OS and PFS: 
tumour type (both OS and PFS), NLR (PFS), PD-L1 T cells (PFS), and tumor mutational burden (PFS). 
Case Match Analysis 
The exploratory analysis of OS and PFS by exposure metrics of tremelimumab revealed that the 
patients in Q1 of Cmin, Dose 5 Treme were associated with a lower survival than those in the SoC arm; 
however, several confounding covariates could have influenced this observation. 
To supplement the CPH models for OS and PFS, patients from the SoC arm were matched with those in 
Q1 of Cmin, Dose 5 Treme of the T + D + SoC arm. Matching was performed based on the distributions of 
the following 10 disease-related covariates: baseline tumor size, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) score at baseline, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum albumin (ALB), lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), tumor burden (> or < 12 mutations per 
megabase), tumor type (non-squamous vs squamous), 25% of PD-L1 TC, and the chemotherapy used 
in SoC (abraxane based vs gemcitabine based vs pemetrexed based). All the 82 treated patients in the 
Q1 subgroup were successfully matched to 82 patients in the SoC arm. All covariates in the selected 
82 SoC patients were balanced after matching. 
The HR for the comparison of patients in the Q1 subgroup with matched patients from the SoC arm 
was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.76-1.44) for OS and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.72-1.36) for PFS (Table 17). These results 
contrast with the HR calculated for the unmatched population. For OS, the HR was 1.42 (95% CI: 
1.10-1.84) and was 1.23 (95% CI: 0.95-1.58) for PFS. The 95% CI of PFS HR for both unmatched and 
matched patients includes 1, suggesting that the apparent difference between groups in the Kaplan-
Meier plot is not statistically significant. In conclusion, the case match analysis suggested that the 
observed relationship with tremelimumab exposure is possibly confounded by disease-related 
covariates.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) 
The ORR was dichotomized as partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), vs. stable disease or 
progression of disease (PD) and analyzed using a logistic regression model relating the probability of 
being a responder to durvalumab and tremelimumab exposure metrics. This analysis focused on the 
combination treatment arm of T + D + SoC in which 330 patients received treatment. The ORR in 8 of 
the patients was not evaluable and excluded from this analysis. Of the remaining 322 patients, 3 
patients did not have durvalumab exposure metrics and 4 patients did not have tremelimumab 
exposure metrics. Therefore, logistic regression models for assessing effect of durvalumab and 
tremelimumab were based on 319 and 318 patients, respectively. 
In general, there appeared to be no clear trend between durvalumab exposure and the probability of 
being a responder. For tremelimumab, the plots appear to suggest an increase in the probability of 
being a responder with increasing exposure (Figure 13). However, the relatively large p-values show 
that none of the exposure metrics has a statistically significant impact (at the prespecified significance 
level of α = 0.001) on the probability of being a responder. It should be noted that for tremelimumab, 
the distribution of AUC after Dose 5, trough concentration after first dose, and after Dose 5 is 
somewhat narrow and there are a few potentially outlying patients. 
In general, there was no clear trend between the covariates and the probability of being a responder.

Exposure-safety relationship 
The safety endpoints of interest were Grade 3 and above treatment-related adverse events (AEs), 
Grade 3 and above adverse events of special interest (AESIs), AEs leading to durvalumab treatment 
discontinuation and AEs leading to tremelimumab treatment discontinuation, focusing on the 
durvalumab + tremelimumab + SoC arm only.

Of the 330 patients in this arm, 3 did not have durvalumab exposure metrics while 4 did not have 
tremelimumab exposure metrics hence 327 and 326 patients were analyzed in the logistic regression 
models for durvalumab and tremelimumab respectively. 
The relationship between the probability of having Grade 3 and above treatment-related AEs and AUC 
after the first dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab is shown in Figure 14. The relationship between 
the probability of having Grade 3 and above treatment-related AESIs and AUC after the first dose of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab is shown in Figure 15. 
In general, there appears to be no clear trend between increasing exposure and the probability of AEs. 
The p-values associated with exposure effects were relatively large (in comparison to the prespecified 
significance level of α = 0.001) indicating that the relationship was not statistically significant. 
Although not statistically significant, it was notable that the coefficients for the effect of durvalumab on 
probability of Grade 3 and above treatment-related AEs were negative, suggesting a counterintuitive 
decrease in the probability of AEs with increasing exposure. However, these effects were small and not 
statistically significant. In general, the apparent overlap in the distribution of exposure between the 
patients that had and those that did not have AEs suggested no clear relationship between exposure 
and the probability of having AEs.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of tremelimumab alone or in combination with durvalumab have been investigated in patients 
enrolled in 3 Phase I/Ib studies, 1 Phase I/II study, 3 Phase II/IIb studies and 6 Phase III studies. 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tremelimumab was assessed as monotherapy and in combination with 
durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab was studied in patients with doses ranging from 75 mg to 750 
mg (or 10 mg/kg) administered intravenously once every 4 or 12 weeks as monotherapy. PK exposure 
increased dose proportionally (linear PK) at doses ≥ 75 mg. Steady-state was achieved at 
approximately 12 weeks. Based on population PK analysis that included 1605 patients who received 
tremelimumab monotherapy or in combination with durvalumab with or without chemotherapy in the 
dose range of ≥ 75 mg (or 1 mg/kg) every 3 or 4 weeks, the geometric mean steady-state volume of 
distribution (Vss) was 6. 33 L. Tremelimumab clearance (CL) decreased over time in combination with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy resulting in a geometric mean steady-state clearance (CLss) of 0.309 
L/day; the decrease in CLss was not considered clinically relevant. The geometric mean terminal half 
life was approximately 14.2 days. The primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein 
catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 43/134 
 
 
 
 
In the POSEIDON study, overall PK profiles of durvalumab were similar between T + D + SoC and D + 
SoC arms, suggesting tremelimumab or SoC do not have an impact on PK of durvalumab when 
administered as combination therapy. 
Overall, PK results of gemcitabine and Abraxane were similar between T + D + SoC, D + SoC, and SoC 
alone arms, suggesting durvalumab or tremelimumab do not have an impact on PK of SoC 
chemotherapy (gemcitabine or Abraxane) when administered as combination therapy. 
In spite of these differences in study design, the assessed PK data (Cmax and Ctrough) for 
tremelimumab appear to be broadly comparable across studies. 
A population PK model was developed for tremelimumab based on a pooled dataset from 6 Studies: 
Study 02, Study 06, Study 10, DETERMINE, BASKET and POSEIDON, which comprised of 5455 serum 
concentrations from 1605 patients. The final Pop PK model of tremelimumab was a 2-compartment 
model with linear CL and an additional time-dependent CL component for patients on combination 
therapy only. The following covariates were identified as statistically significant and included in the 
final model: body weight and sex on both CL and V1; albumin, primary indication and combination 
therapy (chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy) on CL. The effect of body weight was allometrically 
scaled with estimated exponents of 0.370 and 0.453 for CL and V1, respectively, indicating that the 
effect of body weight was less than proportional. Residual unexplained variability is low (28%) and 
low-to-moderate inter-individual random effects were identified on CL (39%), V1 (21%) and V2 
(49%). In addition, an omega was included on Tmax to account for a random variation on the time-
dependency effect on CL. No trends were observed on the ETA distribution of Tmax across the different 
covariates evaluated, suggesting that the large IIV on Tmax is caused by a large and random 
distribution of inter-individual differences that are not linked to any covariate tested. The final model 
was evaluated by means of non-parametric bootstrap analysis (n=1000), RSEs, GOF-plots and pcVPCs. 
The evaluation of the GOF confirmed the adequacy of the structural population PK model proposed, but 
some bias have been observed in the DV vs IPRED plot, where large deviation (>10-fold) were 
observed between IPRED and DV. Slight model over-prediction was observed in these 22 observations 
out of 5238 observations. Most of the observations (12/22) were around the Cmax, suggesting that 
the model slightly over-predicts Cmax concentrations in those individuals. Based on the small 
proportion of observations that were over-predicted (0.42%), the model misspecification is considered 
of minor relevance. A large number of bootstrap runs failed to converge (474/1000) due to rounding 
errors which may indicate an unstable model. However, it seems termination status was not an 
important indicator of the quality of bootstrap parameter estimates and all median estimates and 95% 
CI of each parameter were close to the final model parameter estimates. The overall model 
performance was observed based on the pcVPC, suggesting no significant trends across the different 
percentiles. No relevant trends were observed across the different pcVPC stratified by the significant 
covariates, suggesting the overall adequacy of the model to capture the different sub-groups of 
populations. 
Age (22 – 97 years), body weight (34 - 149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, 
albumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, tumour type, race or ECOG/WHO status had no clinically 
significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. 
The effect of mild hepatic impairment and mild or moderate renal impairment was evaluated in pop PK 
analyses showing no impact on the exposure of tremelimumab. Accordingly, no dose adjustment is 
required in these special populations. There are insufficient data in patients with severe renal 
impairment for dosing recommendations However, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily 
cleared via renal pathways, a change in renal function is not expected to influence tremelimumab 
exposure. Data from patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment are limited. However, as 
IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 44/134 
 
 
 
is not expected to influence tremelimumab exposure and as a consequence, no dose adjustment of 
Imjudo is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required for 
elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) (see Special populations in section 2.3.2). Data on patients aged 
75 years of age or older are limited. 
The presence of tremelimumab ADA did not impact tremelimumab PK, as it was not identified as a 
significant covariate in the tremelimumab PopPK analysis. There was no clear evidence that the 
presence of tremelimumab ADA had any potential impact on the safety in POSEIDON study. 
The durvalumab PopPK model was updated by including 11683 serum PK samples from 2827 patients. 
The model was based on a pooled dataset from 5 Studies: Study 1108, POSEIDON, ATLANTIC, 
PACIFIC and CASPIAN. The final model was evaluated by means of non-parametric bootstrap analysis 
(n=500), RSEs, GOF-plots and pcVPCs. Changes on AUCss due to sex, durva+chemo and low ALB and 
on Cmax due to low body weight and sex are very close to the clinical relevance of 20%. Prediction-
corrected VPCs stratified by clinical treatment, body weight, sex and albumin suggested that the 
durvalumab PopPK model adequately captures different subgroups of populations and no dose 
adjustments may be needed based on the clinical relevance analysis. 
Both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were explored by Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
estimates and analysed by Cox proportional hazard (CPH) models based on data from patients 
receiving the durvalumab + tremelimumab + SOC. Models were evaluated by graphically 
superimposing model-predictions over the observed data. The proportional hazard assumption was 
supported by a non-significant relationship between residuals and time except for the covariate 
logNLR. Linear mixed-effects exposure-response modelling with an intercept was conducted to 
characterize the relationship of change from baseline of QTcF (ΔQTcF) with durvalumab or 
tremelimumab serum concentrations. The slope or the intercept for tremelimumab and durvalumab 
were significantly different from 0. However, for both tremelimumab and durvalumab, the upper bound 
of the 90% CI for ΔQTcF was less than 10 ms, and the highest observed concentration had a predicted 
mean ΔQTcF of less than 5 ms. These values were lower than the prolongation levels of concern as 
established in the ICH E14 industry guidance for clinical evaluation of QT/QTc interval prolongation and 
proarrhythmic potential for non-antiarrhythmic drugs. The normality assumption was largely met and 
no hysteresis was apparent in the ΔQTcF vs. tremelimumab concentration plots. 
A weight-based dosing regimen of 1 mg/kg 3W of tremelimumab was proposed for patients weighting 
30 kg or less, to align the dosing recommendation with that of durvalumab for which a 30 kg cut-off 
was set based on a FDA-requested change to the endotoxin acceptance criteria during review of the 
initial durvalumab Investigational New Drug submission (June 2015). The predicted tremelimumab 
dose 5 (AUCdose5, Cmin,dose5) exposures for 30 kg or 20 kg body weights were generally lower 
compared to those observed in POSEIDON across the body weight quartiles. The lack of safety concern 
with this proposal was acknowledged. In addition, the MAH argued that since no clinically meaningful 
relationship between exposure and efficacy (OS and PFS) was observed for tremelimumab, and the 
efficacy results were similar across BW quartiles, the efficacy for patients with body weights less than 
or equal to 30 kg is expected to be similar to those weighing over 30 kg and receiving equivalent fixed 
doses in POSEIDON. The fixed dosing regimen of 75 mg Q3W was evaluated through a model-based 
analysis in patients between 30-34 kg (not enrolled in POSEIDON), and a >30% higher AUCss was 
predicted compared to patients between 34-58 kg. This increase in exposure gave raise to concerns 
regarding safety because (1) the predicted AUCss range with the fixed dosing regimen was higher 
(250-600 micrograms·h/mL) compared to the evaluated AUCss range in the exposure-safety analysis 
(<300 micrograms·h/mL), and (2) the slight positive exposure-safety relationship observed. A body 
weight regimen would provide more similar exposure to that observed in patients with higher body 
weight (>34 kg). Even in case of (slightly) lower exposure, lack of efficacy is not considered a concern, 
Assessment report

as discussed above. Considering all this, the cut-off below which tremelimumab is to be administered 
according to body weight was finally fixed at 34kg and reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting tremelimumab, except 
physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not 
recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy 
of tremelimumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after 
starting tremelimumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions. 
No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with 
tremelimumab. Since the primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein catabolism via 
reticuloendothelial system or target-mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are 
expected. PK drug-drug interactions between tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy were assessed in the POSEIDON study and showed no clinically 
meaningful PK interactions between tremelimumab, durvalumab, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, 
pemetrexed, carboplatin or cisplatin in the concomitant treatment. 
Assessment of an exposure-efficacy relationship was conducted using OS, PFS, and ORR as efficacy 
parameters in patients from POSEIDON. 
OS and PFS were explored by Kaplan-Meier estimates and analyzed by Cox proportional-hazards 
models based on data from patients in the T + D + SoC arm. 
ORR was dichotomized as partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), vs. stable disease or 
progression of disease (PD) and analyzed using a logistic regression model relating the probability of 
being a responder to durvalumab and tremelimumab exposure metrics. 
For some of the tremelimumab PK parameters (AUCDose 5, Cmin, Dose 5, and Cmin, Dose 1), there was a 
trend that patients with exposure in the 1st quartile had shorter OS compared to those in the 2nd 
quartile. Similarly, patients in the 2nd quartile had also a shorter OS than those in the 3rd quartile. 
However, no difference was observed between 3rd and 4th quartile. Further, for all quartiles but the 
1st, the Kaplan-Meier curves of OS were above that of the SoC arm. 
Similar to what was observed for OS, the Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS were for all quartiles, but the 1st, 
above that of the SoC arm for the same tremelimumab PK parameters (AUCDose 5, Cmin, Dose 5, and Cmin, 
Dose 1). 
In order to assess whether confounding factors could explain the fact that the 1st quartile had a worse 
OS and PFS than SoC, a case match analysis was performed, and this analysis suggested that the 
observed relationship with tremelimumab exposure was possibly confounded by disease-related 
covariates. 
In terms of ORR, the plots appeared to suggest an increase in the probability of being a responder with 
increasing exposure to tremelimumab. 
There appeared to be no clear trend between durvalumab exposure and the probability of being a 
responder. 
Since the exposure-efficacy relationships was only evaluated through Kaplan-Meier plots with OS and 
PFS between tremelimumab vs SoC arms, the evaluation was in the first place considered insufficient. 
Additional statistical analyses (K-M and cox-regression analyses) conducted between T+D+chemo vs 
D+chemo arms were requested. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 46/134 
 
 
 
As a result, the exposure-response CPH model for OS was updated based on durvalumab and 
tremelimumab treated patients from T + D + SoC versus D + SoC arms. OS KM plots for 
tremelimumab exposure metrics by quartiles at dose 1 and at dose 5, respectively, were provided. 
The KM curve of D + SoC arm was above that of the SoC arm, and in the middle of those of different 
tremelimumab exposure quartiles. The impact of a number of identified covariates was assessed via 
the computation of the Hazard Ratio. 
According to the applicant, the exposure-response CPH model for PFS was also updated based on 
durvalumab and tremelimumab treated patients from T + D + SoC versus D + SoC arms. The impact 
of a number of identified covariates was assessed via the computation of the Hazard Ratio. 
For assessment of an exposure-safety relationship, the evaluated safety endpoints were Grade 3 and 
above treatment-related AEs from POSEIDON, Grade 3 and above AESIs, AEs leading to durvalumab 
treatment discontinuation and AEs leading to tremelimumab treatment discontinuation, focusing on the 
durvalumab + tremelimumab + SoC arm only. None of the tremelimumab or durvalumab exposure 
metrics were identified to have an influence on safety events in a logistic regression analysis. 
In addition, a body weight-AE analysis found no clear sign of a higher frequency of AEs in subjects with 
low body weight. 
The findings related to immunogenicity indicate a low immunogenicity risk of tremelimumab. 
With respect to the concentration-QTc-analysis, modeling results did not identify a significant linear 
relationship between tremelimumab or durvalumab serum concentrations and ΔQTcF. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Considering the nature of the product, the pharmacology package is considered adequate and the 
dosing of tremelimumab is considered appropriate with the proposed modification to use weight-based 
dosing for patients below 34kg, as discussed above.

The chosen platinum doublet was prespecified at randomisation before first study treatment and 
subsequent changes of regimen were not allowed, although switch between cisplatin and carboplatin 
were permitted. The following histology-based chemotherapy regimens were applicable to all 3 
treatment arms: 
•  Nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin (squamous and non-squamous histologies): Nab-paclitaxel 100 
mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle + carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 via IV infusion on 
Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy 
and D + SoC chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy arm). 
•  Gemcitabine + cisplatin (squamous histology only): Gemcitabine 1000 or 1250 mg/m2 via IV 
infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle + cisplatin 75 mg/m2 via IV infusion on Day 1 
of each 21-day cycle, for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy and D 
+ SoC chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy arm). 
•  Gemcitabine + carboplatin (squamous histology only): Gemcitabine 1000 or 1250 mg/m2 via 
IV infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle + carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 via IV infusion on 
Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy 
and D + SoC chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy arm). 
• 
Pemetrexed + carboplatin (non-squamous histology only): Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and 
carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4

cycles for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles 
for the SoC chemotherapy arm); then continued pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 maintenance (i.e., 
Q4W for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms. 
• 
Pemetrexed + cisplatin (non-squamous histology only): Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 
75 mg/m2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the 
T + D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC 
chemotherapy arm); then continued pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 maintenance (i.e., Q4W for the T 
+ D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms. 
*Note: For patients with non-squamous histology who received pemetrexed during induction, 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy could have been given either Q3W or Q4W dependent on 
investigator decision and local standards. 
Arm 1: During chemotherapy, tremelimumab 75 mg IV Q3W + durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q3W + 
chemotherapy Q3W for 4 cycles. A fifth dose of tremelimumab 75 mg was to be given at Week 16 
alongside durvalumab Dose 6. Post chemotherapy, durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q4W. 
Arm 2: During chemotherapy, durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q3W and chemotherapy Q3W for 4 cycles. Post 
chemotherapy, durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q4W. 
Arm 3: Chemotherapy Q3W alone for 4 cycles (any of the abovementioned 5 regimens). Patients could 
receive additional 2 cycles (a total of 6 cycles post-randomization), as clinically indicated, at 
Investigator’s discretion. 
The study design did not allow cross over among treatment arms. 
Duration of treatment: Patients were treated until clinical progression or radiological progression 
unless there was unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion was 
met. 
Reductions and delays: Dose reductions of durvalumab and tremelimumab were not permitted. SoC-
related toxicity management and dose adjustment, including dose reductions and delays, should be 
performed as indicated in the local prescribing information for the relevant agent. In the event that an 
AE could reasonably be attributed to SoC, dose adjustment of SoC was attempted before modifying the 
administration of durvalumab ± tremelimumab. In the event that SoC was delayed, durvalumab ± 
tremelimumab was also delayed. 
Switch of platinum agent: In the event of unfavourable tolerability, patients could switch between 
cisplatin and carboplatin therapy at any point on study (assuming eligibility for the switched therapy is 
met). 
Treatment beyond progression: Patients in arms 1 and 2 with objective radiological progression who, 
in the investigator’s opinion, continued to receive benefit from their assigned treatment and who met 
the criteria for treatment in the setting of (PD) could continue to receive durvalumab monotherapy for 
as long as they were gaining clinical benefit. 
Retreatment: Patients in Treatment Arm 1 (T + D + SoC chemotherapy) with radiological progression 
who, in the investigator’s opinion, continued to receive benefit from their assigned treatment and who 
met the criteria for retreatment in the setting of PD, could have retreatment with durvalumab + 
tremelimumab combination therapy (only once). 
*Note: For patients randomized to Treatment Arm 3, treatment beyond progression and retreatment 
was not permitted.

Sample size 
The study will enrol approximately 2000 patients to randomize approximately 1000 patients in a 1:1:1 
ratio to durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy, durvalumab 
monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy, or SoC chemotherapy alone (approximately 333 patients in each 
treatment arm), including at least 250 patients in each treatment arm with PD-L1 TC <50%. 
The study is sized for dual primary endpoints to characterize the PFS and OS benefits of durvalumab 
monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC chemotherapy alone in the intent-to- treat (ITT) 
population. 
Dual Primary Endpoints: 
Durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC chemotherapy alone (PFS in ITT 
population): Assuming the true PFS HR is 0.67 and the median PFS in SoC chemotherapy alone arm 
is 6 months, 497 PFS events from the global cohort (75% maturity) will provide greater than 90% 
power to demonstrate statistical significance at the 2-sided alpha level of 0.9% (with overall alpha for 
PFS 1%), allowing for 1 interim analysis conducted at approximately 80% of the target events. The 
smallest treatment difference that is statistically significant will be an HR of 0.79. Assuming a 
recruitment period of 16 months, this analysis is anticipated to be 25 months from FPI. 
Durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC chemotherapy alone (OS in ITT 
population): Assuming the true OS HR is 0.7 and the median OS in SoC arm is 12.9 months, 532 OS 
events (80% maturity) will provide greater than 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at 
the 2-sided alpha level of a 3.3% (with overall alpha for OS 4%), allowing for 3 interim analyses 
conducted at approximately 45%, 61% and 84% of the target events. The smallest treatment 
difference that is statistically significant will be an HR of 0.83. Assuming a recruitment period of 16 
months, this analysis is anticipated to be 46 months from FPI. 
Key secondary Endpoints: 
Durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC 
chemotherapy alone (PFS in ITT population): Assuming the true PFS HR is 0.51 and the median

PFS in SoC chemotherapy alone arm is 6 months, 465 PFS events from the global cohort (70% 
maturity) will provide greater than 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at the 2-sided 
alpha level of 0.9% (with overall alpha for PFS 1%), allowing for 1 interim analysis conducted at 
approximately 80% of the target events (information fraction). The smallest treatment difference that 
is statistically significant will be an HR of 0.78. Assuming a recruitment period of 16 months, this 
analysis is anticipated to be 25 months from FPI. 
Durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC 
chemotherapy alone (OS in ITT population): Assuming the true OS HR is 0.7 and the median OS 
in SoC arm is 12.9 months, 532 OS events (80% maturity) will provide greater than 90% power to 
demonstrate statistical significance at the 2-sided alpha level of a 3.3% (with overall alpha for OS 
4%), allowing for 3 interim analyses conducted at approximately 45%, 61% and 84% of the target 
events (information fraction). The smallest treatment difference that is statistically significant will be 
an HR of 0.83. Assuming a recruitment period of 16 months, this analysis is anticipated to be 46 
months from FPI. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The randomization scheme was produced by a computer software program that incorporates a 
standard procedure for generating randomization numbers. One randomization list was produced for 
each of the randomization stratum. A blocked randomization was generated, and all centers used the 
same list to minimize any imbalance in the number of patients assigned to each treatment arm. 
Patients were identified to the IVRS/IWRS per country regulations. Randomization codes were assigned 
strictly sequentially, within each stratum, as patients become eligible for randomization. Patients who 
fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio 
according to the following stratification scheme: 
• 
PD-L1 tumour expression status (PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumour cells [PD-L1 TC 
≥50%] versus PD-L1 TC <50%) 
•  Disease stage (Stage IVA versus Stage IVB) 
•  Histology (non-squamous versus squamous) 
•  Blinding (masking) 
The study is open label. A BICR of images will be performed. Results of these independent reviews will 
not be communicated to Investigators, and the management of patients will be based solely upon the 
results of the RECIST 1.1 assessment conducted by the Investigator. The BICR of all radiological scans 
will be performed to derive the ORR, PFS, DoR, BoR, and APF12 endpoints according to RECIST 1.1. 
The BICR will include assessment by RECIST 1.1. The imaging scans will be reviewed by 2 independent 
radiologists and will be adjudicated, if required, by a third independent radiologist who will choose the 
assessments of 1 of the 2 primary reviewers. 
This study will use an external Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to assess ongoing 
safety analyses as well as the interim efficacy analysis.

Statistical methods 
Full analysis set 
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized patients. Treatment arms were to be compared 
on the basis of randomized study treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. Patients 
who were randomized but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment were included in the 
analysis in the treatment arm to which they were randomized. 
Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints 
Progression-free survival 
The dual primary PFS analysis was to be based on the BICR tumour assessments according to RECIST 
1.1. The full analysis set will be used. The analysis used a stratified log-rank test adjusting for PD-L1 
tumour expression (PD-L1 ≥50% versus PD-L1 <50%), histology (squamous versus non-squamous), 
and disease stage (Stage IVA and Stage IVB) for generation of the p-value. The covariates in the 
statistical modelling were to be based on the values entered into interactive voice response system 
(IVRS) at randomization, even if it is subsequently discovered that these values were incorrect. 
The hazard ratio (HR) and its CI will be estimated from a stratified Cox proportional hazards model 
(with ties = Efron and PD-L1 tumour expression (PD-L1≥ 50% versus PD-L1 <50%), histology 
(squamous versus non-squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA and Stage IVB) included in the 
STRATA statement) and the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach. 
Key secondary PFS analysis was to be performed using the same methodology as for the dual primary 
PFS analysis described above. 
Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS were to be presented by treatment arm and PD-L1 tumour status and TMB 
subgroup, where appropriate. Summaries of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing a 
PFS event and the type of event (RECIST 1.1 or death) were to be provided along with median PFS for 
each treatment. The assumption of proportionality was to be assessed. 
Censoring rules for PFS: Subjects who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis were to 
be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 
assessment. However, if the subject progresses or dies after two or more missed visits, the subject will 
be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment prior to the two missed visits 
(Note: NE visit is not considered as missed visit). If the subject has no evaluable visits or does not 
have baseline data they will be censored at Day 1 unless they die within two visits of baseline (12 
weeks plus 1 week allowing for a late assessment within the visit window), in which case the date of 
death is used when deriving PFS. 
Sensitivity analyses: The following sensitivity analyses will be performed for the treatment 
comparisons of the dual primary and key secondary endpoints based on the FAS: 
•  A sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess possible evaluation-time bias that may be 
introduced if scans are not performed at the protocol-scheduled time points. The midpoint 
between the time of progression and the previous evaluable RECIST assessment (using the 
final date of the assessment) will be analysed using a stratified log-rank test. 
•  Attrition bias will be assessed by repeating the dual primary/key secondary PFS analysis except 
that the actual PFS event times, rather than the censored times, of subjects who progressed or 
died in the absence of progression immediately following two or more non-evaluable tumour 
assessments will be included. In addition, and within the same sensitivity analysis, subjects 
who take subsequent therapy (note that for this analysis radiotherapy is not considered a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 56/134 
 
 
 
subsequent anticancer therapy) prior to their last evaluable RECIST assessment or progression 
or death will be censored at their last evaluable assessment prior to taking the subsequent 
therapy. 
•  Ascertainment bias will be assessed by analysing the site investigator data. The stratified log-
rank test will be repeated on the programmatically derived PFS using the site investigator data. 
•  An additional sensitivity analysis will be performed with the covariates used in the statistical 
model derived from eCRF data rather than using the values from IVRS. 
Consistency of treatment effect between subgroups: Interactions between treatment and 
stratification factors will be tested to rule out any qualitative interaction using the approach of Gail and 
Simon (Gail and Simon 1985). This test will be performed separately for the treatment comparisons of 
the dual primary and key secondary endpoints based on the FAS. 
Overall survival 
OS will be analysed using stratified log-rank tests, using the same methodology as described for the 
PFS endpoints. 
The assumption of proportionality will be assessed in the same way as for PFS. 
Censoring rules for OS: Any subject not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored 
based on the last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive. 
Sensitivity analysis and additional supportive summaries: A three-component stratified max-
combo test will be used as a sensitivity analysis with the same stratification factors as the primary 
analysis. 
A sensitivity analysis for OS will examine the censoring patterns to rule out attrition bias with regards 
to the treatment comparisons of the dual primary and key secondary endpoints, achieved by a Kaplan-
Meier plot of time to censoring where the censoring indicator of OS is reversed. 
A sensitivity analysis may be conducted to assess for the potential impact of COVID-19 deaths on OS. 
Exploratory analyses of OS adjusting for the impact of subsequent immunotherapy or other 
investigational treatment may be performed if a sufficient proportion of subjects switch. 
Objective response rate 
The ORR will be compared using logistic regression models adjusting for the same factors as the PFS 
endpoints. The results of the analysis will be presented in terms of an odds ratio (an odds ratio greater 
than 1 will favor the experimental arms) together with its associated profile likelihood 95% CI (e.g. 
using the option ‘LRCI’ in SAS procedure GENMOD) and p-value (based on twice the change in log-
likelihood resulting from the addition of a treatment factor to the model). 
If there are not enough responses for a meaningful analysis using logistic regression then a Fisher’s 
exact test using mid p-values will be presented. 
Interim analysis 
Interim analyses for efficacy will be performed by IDMC as described below: One interim analysis of 
PFS will be performed when approximately 80% of the target PFS events have occurred across Arms 2 
and 3. Three interim analyses of OS will be performed; the first at the time of the interim PFS analysis 
(approximately 45% of the target OS events in Arms 2 and 3), the second at the time of the primary 
PFS analysis (approximately 61% of the target OS events in Arms 2 and 3) and the third when 
approximately 84% of the target OS events have occurred in Arms 2 and 3. The interim analyses will 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 57/134 
 
 
 
be performed for the analyses specified in MTP. It is expected that global recruitment will have 
completed prior to the results of the interim analyses being available. 
The Lan DeMets spending function that approximates an O’Brien Fleming approach will be used to 
account for multiplicity introduced by including the one interim analysis for superiority. The boundaries 
for the treatment comparison will be derived based upon the exact number of events at the time of 
analyses. 
Multiple testing procedures for controlling the type 1 error rate 
In order to strongly control the type I error at 5% (2-sided), a multiple testing procedure (MTP) with 
gatekeeping strategy will be used across the dual primary endpoints and the secondary endpoints 
included in MTP. 
The dual primary endpoints: PFS and OS (durvalumab monotherapy +SoC chemotherapy versus SoC 
chemotherapy alone) in the ITT population (with PFS using BICR assessments per RECIST 1.1). 
The key secondary endpoints: PFS and OS (durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC 
chemotherapy and SoC chemotherapy alone) in the ITT population (with PFS using BICR assessments 
per RECIST 1.1). 
Hypotheses will be tested using a multiple testing procedure with an alpha-exhaustive recycling 
strategy (Burman et al 2009). With this approach, hypotheses will be tested in a pre-defined order as 
outlined in Figure 6. According to alpha (test mass) splitting and alpha recycling, if the higher level 
hypothesis in the MTP is rejected for superiority, the next lower level hypothesis will then be tested. 
The test mass that becomes available after each rejected hypothesis is recycled to lower level 
hypotheses not yet rejected. This testing procedure stops when the entire test mass is allocated to 
non- rejected hypotheses. Implementation of this pre-defined ordered testing procedure, including 
recycling, will strongly control type I error at 5% (2-sided), among all the dual primary endpoints and 
the secondary endpoints included in MTP.

Amendment history 
The following changes of analysis from protocol are based on CSP v4.0, dated 25-SEP-2018: 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) has been formulated to indicate that the following exploratory 
objective may not be produced, for the reason that the AZ imaging expert confirmed that AZ does not 
currently have the capacity of obtaining the data using irRECIST: 
To explore irRECIST as an assessment methodology for clinical benefit of durvalumab + tremelimumab 
combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy and durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy 
compared with SoC chemotherapy alone with assessment by BICR has been changed to a potential. 
The analysis of expected duration of response (EDoR) was not a required analysis, so not included for 
DoR endpoints in the SAP. This is consistent with other durvalumab studies. 
The analysis of comparison of APF12 between treatment arms is removed to be consistent with other 
durvalumab studies. 
Additional changes not included in SAP version 5.0 
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis of ORR was added requiring confirmation of response no sooner than 4 
weeks after the initial CR/PR was conducted. 
Symptom improvement rate was analysed using logistic regression, using Proc Logistic instead of Proc 
Genmod.

•  Participant flow 
A total of 1807 patients were screened into the POSEIDON study: of these, 1013 patients were 
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of the study arms (T + D + SoC, D + SoC or SoC alone arms) at 
142 study centres across 18 countries in North and Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Africa. 
Patient disposition is summarised in the following figure.

Note: The category “condition worsened” corresponds to “disease progression”. 
A total of 760 patients failed screening. The majority of them did so because of eligibility criteria, 
particularly concerning EGFR/ALK status (36% of all screen failures), missing PD-L1 status (19%), or 
investigator judgement (8%). 
The proportions of patients who discontinued any study treatment on account of adverse events are 
nearly identical in the experimental T+D+SoC and D+SoC arms (23% in each) and nearly double the 
proportion of discontinuations from the control SoC arm (13%).

Outcomes and estimation 
The CSR reported the final analysis for the study, based on the DCO dates of 24-JUL-2019 (RECIST-
related endpoints) and 12-MAR-2021 (all other data). 
At the time of the PFS analysis DCO date (24-JUL-2019), the PFS data had reached 75.7% maturity 
(511 PFS events from 675 patients in the D + SoC and SoC alone arms). 
At the time of the OS analysis DCO (12-MAR-2021), the OS data had reached 81.3% maturity (549 OS 
events from 675 patients in the D + SoC and SoC alone arms). 
Outcomes of the multiple testing procedure (MTP) - POSEIDON: 
The primary OS endpoint (D+SoC vs SoC) in study POSEIDON did not meet statistical significance. 
However, the other primary PFS endpoint that compared the same arms showed statistical superiority 
and thus alpha was propagated to the next testing level, in which OS and PFS were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints in the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms.

IVA vs Stage IVB) in the strata statement, and the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach. 
A HR <1 favors T + D + SoC chemotherapy to be associated with a longer OS than SoC chemotherapy alone. 
P-values were generated using the stratified log-rank test adjusting for PD-L1 (PD-L1 ≥50% vs PD-L1 <50%), histology 
(squamous vs non-squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA vs Stage IVB) and using the Breslow approach for handling ties.

Response does not require confirmation. 
In practice, considering '5 weeks' as threshold to allow for the 1-week permitted time-window. 
DoR is the time from the first documentation of complete response or partial response until the date of progression, death in 
absence of progression, or the last evaluable RECIST assessment for patients who progress or die after 2 or more missed 
visits. 
Calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. 
r 
The analysis was performed using logistic regression adjusting for PD-L1 (PD-L1 ≥50% vs PD-L1 <50%), histology (squamous vs 
non-squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA vs Stage IVB), with the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach and the p-
value calculated based on twice the change in log-likelihood resulting from the addition of a treatment factor to the model. 
There was 1 patient who died 1 day prior to randomization and was censored at Day 1.

Calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. 
The HR and CI are estimated from a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with the Efron method to control for ties, the stratification factors 
PD-L1 (PD-L1 ≥50% vs PD-L1 <50%), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA vs Stage IVB) in the strata 
statement, and the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach. A hazard ratio <1 favors D +T + SoC or D + SoC to be associated with a 
longer PFS than SoC chemotherapy. 
P-values were generated using the stratified log-rank test adjusting for PD-L1 (PD-L1 ≥50% vs PD-L1 <50%), histology (squamous vs non-
squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA vs Stage IVB) and using the Breslow approach for handling ties. 
Progression is determined by BICR assessment, RECIST 1.1. 
Patients who have not progressed or died, or who progress or die after 2 or more missed visits, are censored at the latest evaluable RECIST 
assessment or at Day 1 if there are no evaluable visits or no baseline data and patient did not die within 2 visits of baseline. 
The midpoint between the time of progression and the previous evaluable RECIST assessment (using the final date of the assessment) is analyzed. 
Patients who have not progressed or died will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 
assessment, or at Day 1 if there are no evaluable visits. In addition, patients initiating subsequent therapy prior to their last evaluable RECIST 
assessment, progression or death in absence of progression, will be censored at their last evaluable assessment prior to starting subsequent 
therapy. 
Progression is determined by site investigator assessment, RECIST 1.1. 
Covariates used in the statistical model are derived from eCRF data rather than using the values from IVRS.

In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
As explained in the inclusion criteria of pivotal study POSEIDON, the collection of archival/residual 
diagnostic tumour tissue was mandatory, for potential analysis of various markers by IHC or other 
methods. 
One of the exploratory objectives of the trial was to measure PD-L1 expression via the Ventana SP263 
PD-L1 IHC assay and/or TMB to fully investigate the relationship between a patient’s PD-L1 and/or 
TMB and efficacy outcomes with durvalumab, tremelimumab, and SoC regimens. 
Data concerning PD-L1 expression were presented in the ancillary analyses section. Data concerning 
TMB expression and efficacy are not considered clinically relevant and are not presented in this report.

Study NEPTUNE 
NEPTUNE was a Phase III, randomized, open-label study to determine the efficacy and safety of 
durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy versus platinum-based SoC chemotherapy in the 
first-line treatment of patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Crossover 
from SoC to durvalumab monotherapy or durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy was not 
permitted. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the OS benefits of durvalumab + 
tremelimumab vs. SoC used as 1L treatment. During the course of the study and based on the 
emerging results from MYSTIC study, the primary endpoint for NEPTUNE was amended after 
completion of enrolment to prospectively investigate OS in bTMB ≥20 mut/Mb population (results in 
Table 53). A schematic diagram of the overall study design is shown in Figure 33.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant has submitted an application to extend the indication for tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 
immune checkpoint inhibitor, for use in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK 
aberrations. The application is based on efficacy data from POSEIDON, a pivotal phase III, three-arm, 
randomised, multi-centre, open-label study which compared durvalumab + chemotherapy (D+SoC, 
Arm 2) and tremelimumab + durvalumab + chemotherapy (T+D+SoC, Arm 1) to standard-of-care 
histology-specific platinum-based chemotherapy (SoC, Arm 3). 
A total of 1013 patients were randomised between June 2017 and September 2018. The dual primary 
endpoints of BICR-PFS and OS were analysed in the ITT of the D+SoC vs. SoC arms, while identical 
secondary endpoints were evaluated in the ITT of the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant held several regulatory interactions with the US FDA during the development of 
tremelimumab in NSCLC, but scientific advice has not been sought from the CHMP. 
Experimental and control arms: The overall design of POSEIDON resembles that of other recent 
landmark trials in the treatment-naïve setting of metastatic driver-negative NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 
expression, with platinum-based chemotherapy as control arm. Currently, multiple regiments for these 
patients are approved and recommendable across Europe, most of them containing one or more 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., pembrolizumab or atezolizumab or nivolumab + ipilimumab) added 
to histology-selected platinum doublets. Even when this implies that platinum-based chemotherapy by 
itself has been long outdated as standard of care in this setting, it was still an appropriate choice of 
treatment at the time of design and conduct of POSEIDON. 
The fact that crossover was not allowed to avoid confounding OS is understood. Noting that a 
significant number of patients from the control arm would likely receive immune checkpoint inhibitors 
at progression, an exploratory PFS2 analysis was planned. 
Induction vs. maintenance effect: In both experimental arms (D+SoC and T+D+SoC), after induction 
chemotherapy + durvalumab +/- tremelimumab, durvalumab was to be maintained Q4W until 
progressive disease. Although such design does not allow to disentangle effect magnitude of induction 
vs. maintenance immune checkpoint inhibition, this does not constitute an impediment to evaluate the 
B/R profile of the add-on products in this palliative setting. 
Study participants: Inclusion/exclusion criteria in the POSEIDON trial did not suffer any major 
amendments along study conduct and appropriately reflect the target population as in the proposed 
therapeutic indication. Although the inclusion criteria declare that staging is to be determined per the 
IASLC staging manual in thoracic oncology 2016 by Rami-Porta et al, such parameters correspond to 
the AJCC 8th edition by Amin et al. The requirements for inclusion of patients with brain metastases 
are appropriate and in line with similar trials. PD-L1 testing by the SP263 IHC assay was centralised 
during the screening phase and before randomisation, which is endorsed. 
Objectives/endpoints: The current extension of indication application for tremelimumab is based in 
efficacy results from the secondary objectives of this study. An improvement in survival is considered 
the most compelling outcome of a pivotal trial in Oncology, especially when supported by a reciprocal 
prolongation of PFS. The definitions for OS and RECIST 1.1-based BICR-PFS according to the protocol 
and SAP are appropriate. The definitions for the other secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR, PFS2 and 
PROs are also endorsed. 
Statistical methods: Sample size calculations are adequate. The stratification factors [PD-L1 tumour 
expression status (<50%; ≥50%), stage (IVA vs IVB) and histology (non-squamous vs squamous)] are 
clinically relevant and thus appropriate in this disease context. Censoring rules for PFS and OS are 
acceptable. The planned sensitivity and supplementary analyses to assess robustness of PFS and OS 
results are adequate, no additional analyses have been requested. Concerning interim analyses (one 
for PFS at approximately 80% of targeted events and three for OS at approximately 45%, 61% and 
84%), an alpha spending function was used to account for multiplicity due to multiple looks, which is 
acceptable. Regarding the hierarchical testing procedure, if at least OS or PFS of D+SoC vs. SoC were 
statistically significant, the corresponding alpha portion was transferred to the T+D+SoC vs. SoC 
comparison. This strategy controls the type I error. 
Participant flow and recruitment: 1807 patients were screened for eligibility. The screen failure rate 
(42%) is higher than expected, but understandable in view of stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria: the 
majority of patients failed screening because of EGFR/ALK status, missing PD-L1 status or investigator

judgement. The proportion of patients who did not receive the assigned treatment across all three 
arms of POSEIDON is minimal and follows the characteristic attrition pattern in open-label trials: 
slightly more patients withdrew consent in the control arm. Recruitment of the whole study took 
approximately 1 year and 3 months. Median duration of follow-up of ~1 year in the ITT is considered 
borderline for assessment of B/R in the given clinical setting. 
Conduct of the study: Important protocol deviations occurred in a small proportion of patients and are 
overall balanced among arms. A major amendment modified the dual primary endpoints as of 
protocol V 4.0 (25-SEP-2018), when all patients had already been recruited (last patient randomised 
19-SEP-2018) and before the first interim analysis of PFS/OS on 07-JAN-2019. OS for the comparison 
of D+SoC vs. SoC was upgraded, while PFS of T+D+SoC vs. SoC was downgraded, establishing the 
comparisons of D+SoC vs. SoC in the first level (primary endpoints), while relegating the comparisons 
of T+D+SoC vs. SoC to secondary endpoints. According to the applicant, this change was justified on 
emerging external data from other immunotherapy trials. Since the statistical integrity of the trial 
could have been compromised due to changes in SAP, analyses according to original test hierarchy and 
study populations (first 804 patients randomised) were requested, which obtained successful results 
for PFS and OS testing of T+D+SoC vs. SoC. 
Baseline data: The demographic characteristics of patients were relatively balanced among all three 
arms of treatment and correspond to what is expected within the clinical setting of advanced driver-
negative NSCLC: median age was 64 years (27 to 87 years); 76% were male; 56% white, 35% Asian, 
2% black; current/past smokers 78%; 33% had ECOG PS 0. Disease characteristics were also 
balanced among arms: 50% had stage IVA and 50% IVB; 63% had non-squamous tumours and 37% 
squamous; brain/CNS metastases were present in 10.5% of patients; presence of KRAS mutations was 
evaluated in ~15% (149/1013) of the ITT, and documented in 21% (31/149) of those tested. The 
distribution of patients according to tumour PD-L1 status across diverse thresholds (</≥50%, 
</≥25%, </≥1%) was balanced among all three arms of treatment and represents the global pattern 
of PD-L1 expression in advanced NSCLC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary OS endpoint (D+SoC vs SoC) in study POSEIDON did not meet statistical significance. 
However, the other primary PFS endpoint that compared the same arms showed statistical superiority 
and thus alpha was propagated to the next testing level, in which OS and PFS were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints in the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms. 
OS: At data cutoff 12-MAR-2021 and with a median survival follow-up of 12.5 months, 800 deaths had 
occurred (79% of OS maturity) in the ITT population of study POSEIDON. Treatment with T+D+SoC 
showed a statistically significant survival benefit as compared with SoC: HR for OS was 0.77 (95% CI 
0.65, 0.92), p-value 0.00304. K-M estimates of median OS were 14.0 months in the T+D+SoC arm 
and 11.7 months in the SoC arm. Survival performance of the chemotherapy-only control arm in 
POSEIDON is comparable to other pivotal trials in a similar PD-L1 all-comer setting of metastatic 
NSCLC: range of 10.6 in KEYNOTE-189 to 13.9 months in IMpower130. The K-M curves of T+D+SoC 
vs. SoC separate as of the 10th month, noting a delayed treatment effect from added anti-CTLA-4/PD-
L1 therapy. Important censoring occurs as of the 30th month of follow-up, but landmark analysis at 24 
months (OS24) shows a considerably higher proportion of patients alive in the T+D+SoC (33%) as 
compared to the SoC (22%) arm. 
Acknowledging differences in study design –particularly selection of squamous (SQ) or non-squamous 
(NSQ) histologies, or allowing both– and limitations from cross-trial comparisons, it is to note that 
longer median survival was observed in akin studies in which only anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents were added

to backbone platinum-based chemotherapy in the experimental arm: 22.0 months in the chemo + 
pembrolizumab arm in metastatic NSQ NSCLC (KEYNOTE-189; Rodríguez-Abreu et al, JCO 2020); 
21.9 months in the chemo + cemiplimab arm in advanced SQ/NSQ NSCLC (EMPOWER-Lung3; 
Gogishvili et al, ESMO 2021); 19.5 months in the chemo + atezolizumab arm in metastatic SQ/NSQ 
NSCLC (IMpower150, Tecentriq SmPC); 18.6 months in the chemo + atezolizumab arm in metastatic 
NSQ NSCLC (IMpower130; Cappuzzo et al, Ann Onc 2018); 17.1 months in the chemo + 
pembrolizumab arm in metastatic SQ NSCLC (KEYNOTE-407; Paz-Ares et al, JTO 2020). Interestingly, 
however, the addition of both anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 agents to backbone platinum-based 
chemotherapy produced almost identical median OS results as those observed in POSEIDON: 14.1 
months in the histology-based chemotherapy + nivolumab + ipilimumab arm in patients with 
metastatic SQ/NSQ NSCLC (CheckMate 9LA; Paz-Ares et al, Lancet Oncol 2021). 
BICR-PFS: At data cutoff 24-JUL-2019, 749 PFS events (74% maturity) had occurred across the three 
arms of POSEIDON. K-M estimated median PFS was numerically higher in the T+D+SoC arm (6.2 
months) as compared with the SoC arm (4.8 months), while HR for PFS outlines the statistical 
advantage from T+D+SoC vs. SoC: 0.72 (95% CI 0.60, 0.86), p-value 0.00031. The K-M curves 
separate as of the second month and remain separated, highlighting the PFS advantage of T+D+SoC. 
Overall, PFS results from the experimental (both T+D+SoC and D+SoC arms) and control arms of 
POSEIDON are comparable to those from other pivotal trials in the same setting. Results of PFS by 
investigator are overall comparable to BICR assessment and the HR for INV-PFS is consistent with that 
of BICR-PFS, discrepant declarations of the RECIST event occurred in a reasonably low number of 
instances. 
BICR-ORR/DoR: Rather than using the ITT, the calculations of ORR were done using patients with 
measurable disease as the denominator. This is acceptable in a phase III trial since OS and PFS are 
prioritised in hierarchical testing. Both confirmed and unconfirmed responses (almost all of them 
partial) were numerically higher in the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the control SoC arm. However, 
the proportion of responders (unconfirmed responses) was nearly identical between both experimental 
arms: 46.3% in T+D+SoC vs. 48.5% in D+SoC. Responses (unconfirmed responses) were more 
durable in the T+D+SoC arm (median DoR 7.4 months) as compared to the SoC arm (4.2 months), 
supporting the delayed treatment effect hypothesis portrayed in the OS analysis. 
Subsequent treatment/PFS2: A notably higher proportion of patients received subsequent treatments 
in the SoC arm (60%) as compared to either of the experimental arms (41% in T+D+SoC, 44% in 
D+SoC). As expected, the proportion of second-line immunotherapy was higher in the 
immunotherapy-naïve SoC arm (49%, 95 out of 193) as compared to both T+D+SoC (9%, 11/121) 
and D+SoC (9%, 12/137). Across the three arms of POSEIDON, 66% (435/658) of the PFS2 events 
were deaths in the absence of second progression. Albeit the median time to second progression or 
death (PFS2) was comparable among all three arms (10.2 months in T+D+SoC, 10.0 in D+SoC and 
9.1 in SoC), HR for PFS2 (0.72) suggests sustained benefit from T+D+SoC vs. SoC. 
Ancillary analyses: OS and PFS benefits from T+D+SoC vs. SoC seem to be maintained across most of 
the prespecified subgroups. However, in elderly patients (≥75 years of age) a HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 
0.64, 1.71) for OS was reported for T+D+SoC (n=35) vs. SoC (n=40). Due to the exploratory nature 
of this subgroup analysis no definitive conclusions can be drawn. This said, considering that an overall 
worse safety profile was observed in this subgroup of patients, a warning was included in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC stating that in elderly the combination therapy should be used with caution after careful 
consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. Exploratory efficacy and safety results 
in this subgroup are outlined in sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, respectively. 
Importantly, the efficacious advantage –in terms of OS, PFS and ORR– of T+D+SoC vs. SoC is 
maintained regardless of PD-L1 expression status, i.e., above and below diverse PD-L1 cut-offs. Of

note, a similar outcome regarding PD-L1 subgroups was observed in the CheckMate-9LA trial, when 
the nivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy arm was compared against the chemotherapy arm in an 
akin population of advanced NSCLC (p. 99/157, EPAR EMEA/H/C/WS1783). 
The sensitivity analyses of OS and PFS are consistent with the primary analysis of both variables. 
Exploratory analysis of T+D+SoC vs. D+SoC: The survival K-M curves of the experimental arms 
remain close along the first year of follow-up, and subsequently show a wider separation, suggesting 
the benefit from added tremelimumab is established in the long term. This hypothesis is reinforced 
when looking at the duration of response data, as the K-M curves between T+D+SoC and D+SoC 
exhibit wider separation than those from OS or PFS. Importantly, OS subgroup analyses in the PD-L1 
<1% population –about one third of the ITT– suggest the magnitude of survival benefit from T+D+SoC 
is particularly higher in this subgroup, as compared to that seen in across the other PD-L1 cut-offs, 
while the contribution of tremelimumab appears to be less clear as PD-L1 expression increases. 
However, these comparisons portray an exploratory nature –they were not statistically powered– and 
thus no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Supportive data from MYSTIC and NEPTUNE: Including POSEIDON, all three trials were open-label, 
randomised, had a similar metastatic NSCLC targeted population, and dual primary endpoints of OS 
and PFS. The essential difference was that MYSTIC and NEPTUNE did now allow a platinum-based 
backbone chemotherapy in the experimental arms, while POSEIDON did. The overall efficacy outcome 
of MYSTIC and NEPTUNE –none met their primary endpoints– was not different from other trials in 
which anti-PD-L1 monotherapy failed to show benefits for the ITT population, suggesting that the 
subgroup of patients who drive the beneficial trend for ICI-monotherapy were high-PD-L1 expressors 
(usually defined as PD-L1≥50%). Whether OS and PFS data from the ITT of either trial are supportive 
of efficacy benefits from adding tremelimumab to D+SoC is debatable, but in any case, it can be 
inferred that a detrimental OS/PFS effect is not evident. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Although the primary OS endpoint for the comparison of durvalumab + chemotherapy vs. 
chemotherapy was not met in study POSEIDON, the favourable PFS comparison of these arms allowed 
testing of the secondary endpoints of OS and PFS in the tremelimumab + durvalumab + chemotherapy 
(T+D+SoC) vs. chemotherapy (SoC) arms. In the targeted population of patients with metastatic 
EGFR/ALK-negative NSCLC regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression, OS and PFS from treatment with 
T+D+SoC were statistically superior to SoC chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR and 
PFS2 endorsed such benefits, as did subgroup and sensitivity analyses. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The pivotal study to support this indication is POSEIDON, a phase III, randomised, multicentre, three-
arm, open-label study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of durvalumab in combination with 
platinum-based chemotherapy (D+SoC) with that of SoC alone chemotherapy (SoC) for the first
line 
treatment in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, the study also planned to compare the 
‑
efficacy and safety of tremelimumab, durvalumab and SoC chemotherapy combination (T+D+SoC) 
with that of SoC chemotherapy in the same patient population.

Safety dataset: The safety analysis set (SAS) of POSEIDON included all patients who received at least 
1 dose of study treatment and comprised 997 patients: T + D + SoC (n = 330); D + SoC (n = 334); 
and SoC chemotherapy (n = 333). Of note, 1 patient who was randomized to the T + D + SoC arm 
and 1 patient who was randomized to the D + SoC arm only received SoC chemotherapy (see protocol 
deviations) and were included in the SoC chemotherapy arm of the safety analysis set. 
For further support in the evaluation of the safety profile of tremelimumab, the applicant provided data 
from a safety pool (“T + D pan-tumour pool”) that included 2280 patients from 9 studies, who had 
received at least one dose of durvalumab at 1500 mg Q4W, 20 mg/kg Q4W or 10 mg/kg Q2W, in 
combination with tremelimumab at 75 mg Q4W or 1 mg/kg Q4W for any line of therapy across tumour 
types (Table 54). The main advantage of including the results from the T+D pan-tumour pool in the 
safety assessment report is to be able to elucidate the contribution of immunotherapy components to 
the combination safety profile as in the included studies patients only received T+D.

AEs: The integrated analysis of adverse events (AEs) for the safety pools was based on all 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as defined in each individual study. MedDRA v23.1 was 
used for coding of AE data. Data from studies originally reported in previous versions of MedDRA were 
upversioned to MedDRA v23.1 for the integrated safety database. 
Assessment report

AESIs: Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are defined as AEs with potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism that may require frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapies include standard 
endocrine supplementation, as well as treatment of symptoms resulting from endocrine disorders (eg. 
therapies for hyperthyroidism include beta blockers [eg. propranolol], calcium channel blockers [eg. 
verapamil, diltiazem], methimazole, propylthiouracil, and sodium perchlorate). 
imAEs: Immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs) are AESIs (excluding infusion 
related/hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction) consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism that 
require treatment with systemic corticosteroids, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressants, or endocrine 
therapy.  
The AESI categories include dermatitis/rash, pneumonitis, diarrhoea/colitis, endocrinopathies (adrenal 
insufficiency, hyperthyroid events, hypothyroid events, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and Type I diabetes 
mellitus), hepatic events, intestinal perforations, myocarditis, myositis, renal events, pancreatic 
events, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and other rare/miscellaneous events. Infusion 
related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions are AESIs; however, these are not 
assessed for imAE designation because they are common to mAb drugs in general and occur due to a 
mechanism of action different from that for imAEs. 
Adjudication of imAEs: A suspected immune-mediated adverse event (imAE) was identified as AESI 
treated with systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, and/or endocrine therapy, except 
pneumonitis AESIs, which are all suspected imAE. All suspected imAEs underwent medical review, 
which was performed in a blinded manner.  
A confirmed imAE is a suspected imAE that, after medical review, is deemed consistent with an 
immune-mediated mechanism of action, and where there is no clear alternative etiology. The process 
for adjudicating imAEs starting from the study level AE reporting dataset through to confirmed imAE 
included the steps depicted in Figure 35, and the process of adjudicating imAEs is presented in detail in 
the imAE Charter.

Infusion-related and hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions: 
In POSEIDON, AESIs of infusion related reactions (grouped term) were reported in 13 patients (3.9%) 
in the T + D + SoC arm and 5 patients (1.5%) in the SoC alone arm. The majority of the events were 
of CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 in severity with 1 patient (0.3%) in the T + D + SoC arm experiencing a CTCAE 
Grade 3 event. In the T + D + Chemo pool and the T + D pan tumour pool, AESIs of infusion related 
reaction were reported in 17 patients (2.9%) and 45 patients (2.0%), respectively. There were no 
Grade 4 or 5 events. 
In POSEIDON, AESIs of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions (grouped term) were reported in 3 
patients (0.9%) each in the T + D + SoC arm and the SoC alone arm. In the D + T + Chemo pool and 
the T + D pan-tumour pool, AESIs of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions were reported in 5 
patients (0.8%) and 22 patients (1.0%), respectively. 
ADRs: 
The list of incidence of ADRs shown in Table 3 of the SmPC for patients treated with tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is based on the data from 330 
patients in the T + D + SoC arm of the POSEIDON study (Table 67). The frequency of ADRs with 
frequency ‘Not known’ for both regimens (tremelimumab 75 mg in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, and tremelimumab 300 mg in combination 
with durvalumab for the treatment of HCC) has been re-estimated based on a larger safety pool (“T75 
+ D pan-tumour pool”) that includes 3319 patients.

a Percentages are calculated from N1, N2, N3, and N4 for <50 years, ≥50 - <65 years, ≥65 - <75 years, and ≥75 years, 
respectively. Number of patients with events divided by the total number of patients in the age group, multiplied by 100. 
b Seriousness, as assessed by the Investigator. An Ae with missing seriousness is considered serious. 
N1 = Total number of <50 years patients, N2 = Total number of ≥50 - <65 years patients, N3 = Total number of ≥65 - <75 years 
patients, N4 = Total number of ≥ 75 years patients. 
Patients with multiple AEs are counted once for the PT.

Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once in that category. Patients with events in more than one 
category are counted once in each of those categories. 
AEs by PTs with a ≥ 3% higher incidence in patients ≥ 75 years compared with patients < 65 years or 65-74 years and occurring in 
≥ 10% of patients that are ≥ 75 years.. 
Includes AEs with an onset date or pre-treatment AEs that increase in severity on or after the date of first dose and up to and 
including the earlier of 90 days following the date of last dose of study treatment or the date of initiation of the first subsequent 
therapy (whichever occurred first).

Patients are counted once for each preferred term. Number (%) of patients with AEs, sorted by alphabetical order for 
preferred term. Each patient has only been represented with the maximum reported CTCAE grade at either the start of AE or 
after increasing in severity for each system organ class/preferred term. 
The boundaries for the weight quartiles are derived from the overall POSEIDON population with known baseline weight (n = 
1009) and are Q1 = 57.0 kg, Q2 = 67.2 kg and Q3 = 77.0 kg, respectively. 
Percentages calculated from number of patients in the safety analysis set in that weight group in that treatment group.

Immunological events 
POSEIDON: Of the 286 durvalumab evaluable patients in the same arm, 42 (14.7%) tested positive for 
durvalumab at any visit. Of the 278 tremelimumab ADA-evaluable patients in the T + D + SoC arm, 44 
(15.8%) tested positive for tremelimumab ADA at any visit. The overall safety and tolerability profile of 
patients with ADAs was similar to those without ADAs. 
T + D pan-tumour pool: Of the 1379 durvalumab-evaluable patients, 86 (6.2%) tested positive for 
durvalumab at any visit. Of the 1337 tremelimumab ADA-evaluable patients, 171 (12.8%) tested 
positive for tremelimumab at any visit.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Durvalumab and tremelimumab are immunoglobulins, therefore, no formal pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interaction studies have been conducted.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The requested indication is for tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy. In 
order to understand the isolated safety profile of tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 antibody, a 
supplementary analysis of phase II and III trials in which it was administered as monotherapy was 
presented. The tremelimumab monotherapy pool contained 643 patients treated at 10 mg/kg or a 
fixed dose of 750 mg Q4W, regimens that do not compare to the dose intended for marketing 
authorisation (75 mg Q4W). Although tables for the most common PTs for each of the categories were 
not tabulated by frequency, it was determined that diarrhoea was the most common likely-related AE, 
with an incidence of 40% (any grade) and 13% of patients presenting ≥G3 diarrhoea. Of note, 
immune-mediated colitis is a well-known AE from anti-CTLA-4 treatment. 
To evaluate the safety profile of tremelimumab in combination, safety results were also provided for all 
three arms of pivotal trial POSEIDON (T+D+SoC, D+SoC and SoC), a “T+D+chemo pool” and a “T+D 
pan-tumour pool”. The supportive pooled data have been used to try to elucidate the contribution of T 
+ D to the safety profile of the proposed combination. The size and content of the presented safety 
database are deemed sufficient for B/R assessment in the targeted advanced NSCLC population. 
The frequency of ADRs categorized as “Not known” was estimated based on a pooled data set of 
patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab (T75 + D pan-tumour pool, n = 
3319). 
Out of the entire pipeline of phase I, II and III trials where tremelimumab was given in monotherapy 
or in combination at multiple doses/regimens for diverse cancers, the latter was established by 
selecting 8 trials (2 in solid tumours, 4 NSCLC, 2 HNSCC) in which tremelimumab was administered at 
1 mg/kg Q4W x 4 in combination with durvalumab, and 1 single trial (HCC) in which tremelimumab 
was administered at the flat 75 mg dose, the one intended for approval. The selection of these trials 
and exclusion of others (e.g. DANUBE) has been well justified. 
The “T+D+chemo pool” included the T+D+SoC chemotherapy arms of POSEIDON (NSCLC) and 
CASPIAN (ES-SCLC). There is at least another ongoing trial with a T+D+chemo arm (NILE, patients 
with advanced urothelial carcinoma), but results were not available at the time of submission of this 
application. 
Adjudication of imAEs in the POSEIDON study was done programmatically (following a prespecified 
algorithm, without independent review), which is acceptable. 
Exposure: According to the protocol of POSEIDON, tremelimumab as part of the T+D+SoC arm was to 
be administered for up to 5 doses (C1-4, C6). About 66% of patients in the T+D+SoC arm of 
POSEIDON received 5 or more tremelimumab doses, roughly comparable to 61% in CASPIAN. 
Durvalumab was instead to be given along induction chemotherapy (Q3W x 4 cycles), and then 
maintained Q4W until patients met any of the discontinuation criteria. Durvalumab exposure was 
appropriate overall (mean of 12 cycles in both experimental arms, more than half patients receiving 
8). Chemotherapy could be given for a maximum of 4 cycles in the experimental arms and 6 cycles in 
the control arm. Across the three arms, the majority of patients received 4 or more cycles of 
chemotherapy (80% in T+D+SoC, 82% D+SoC and 75% SoC), implying that added immunotherapy 
did not have an impact on chemotherapy exposure. The distribution of the 5 histology-specific 
chemotherapy doublets permitted in the study was balanced among the three arms and reflects global 
trends in physician’s choice for this setting. 
Overall, exposure parameters of chemotherapy, durvalumab and tremelimumab across the different 
arms of study POSEIDON are considered appropriate for the assessment of B/R.

AEs occurred in almost all patients across the three arms of POSEIDON. While high-grade (G3/4) AEs 
occurred in about half of the patients from each arm, G5 AEs were slightly more frequent in the 
experimental arms (12% in T+D+SoC, 10% D+SoC, 9% SoC), as were SAEs (44%, 40% and 35%, 
respectively) and AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment (22%, 24% and 15%, respectively).  
25 out the 26 most frequent AEs (incidence ≥10% in any arm) exhibited numerically higher incidence 
in the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the SoC arm, while the opposite occurred only for neutrophil 
count decreased. Typical chemotherapy-related AEs (anaemia, nausea, neutropenia, decreased 
appetite and fatigue) were the five most frequent AEs across the three arms of POSEIDON, with 
slightly higher incidence in the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the SoC arm. Diarrhoea and rash, with 
potentially immune-related pathophysiology, were considerably more frequent in the T+D+SoC arm 
than in the SoC arm (22% and 19% vs. 15% and 7%, respectively).  
The incidence of hypothyroidism, a well-known imAE, was noticeably higher in the T+D+SoC arm 
(12%) than in the D+SoC (6%) or SoC (1%) arms. In line with these data, the incidence of this AE 
was 11% across both T+D+chemo and T+D pan-tumour pools. 
High-grade (≥G3) AEs: Since the proportions of G3/4 AEs were similar in both T+D+SoC and SoC 
arms (53% and 52%, respectively), it can be inferred that the higher incidence of G≥3 AEs in the 
T+D+SoC arm (66% vs. 61% in SoC) is driven by G5 AEs (12.4% and 9%, respectively), which is 
worrisome. Noting that G5 AEs occurred in 10.2% of the D+SoC arm, it becomes apparent that the 
addition of tremelimumab increases the risk for toxic death.  
The proportions of the most frequent G3/4 AEs were overall similar across the three arms of 
POSEIDON, highlighting events of chemotherapy-related myelotoxicity, increases in pancreatic and 
hepatic enzymes and pneumonia. Of note, high-grade imAEs were not among the most frequently 
observed events in the experimental arms. 
AESIs/imAEs: AESIs included imAEs and infusion-related reactions (IRRs) or hypersensitivity/ 
anaphylaxis reactions.  
The proportion of patients with imAEs was 32% in the T+D+SoC arm, 17% in the D+SoC and 4% in 
the SoC arm. The distribution of G3/4 imAEs (10%, 6% and 1%, respectively), serious imAEs (9%, 5% 
and 1%) and imAEs leading to discontinuation (5%, 4% and 1%) were similar. The distribution of 
specific imAEs in the D+SoC arm is typical for PD-L1 inhibition, with predominance of hypothyroidism 
(6%), hepatotoxicity (3%), pneumonitis (3%) and dermatitis/rash (2%).  
Endocrinopathies, hepatotoxicity and rash/dermatitis are overall more manageable than other imAEs, 
have less impact in morbidity, and less likelihood for becoming serious events or worsening the overall 
outcome of a patient. Events of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been 
reported in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of rash or dermatitis and managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or 
corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
On the other hand, diarrhoea/colitis and pneumonitis might present as challenges since they imply a 
symptomatic burden and often require hospitalisation. The T+D+SoC arm presented twice as many 
cases of immune-mediated diarrhoea/colitis than the D+SoC arm (14 vs. 6) and more cases of 
pneumonitis (14 vs. 9). 
Despite an unexpected proportion of pancreatic events was reported as AESIs in the T+D+SoC arm 
(any-grade 14%, G3/4 1.2%), most of these correspond to laboratorial anomalies (elevations of 
amylase and lipase, among others). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 123/134 
 
 
 
Of note, there was one death related to multiple imAEs: pancreatitis, hepatitis, myocarditis and 
nephritis: these events took place shortly after the second treatment cycle. Patients should be 
monitored for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment with tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Patients should be 
monitored for abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Patients should 
also be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated pancreatitis and myocarditis. Immune 
mediated hepatitis, nephritis, pancreatitis and myocarditis should be managed through dose 
interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of 
the SmPC). 
There was one death due to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in the D+SoC arm. 
Given the mechanism of action of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, other potential 
immune mediated adverse reactions may occur. The following immune-related adverse reactions have 
been observed in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab: myasthenia 
gravis, myositis, polymyositis, meningitis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune 
thrombocytopenia and cystitis noninfective. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and 
managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or corticoisteroid treatment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
IRRs and hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions were rare across the three arms of POSEIDON, and 
nearly all were G1/2: there was only one patient who presented a G3 IRR in the T+D+SoC arm, and 
nobody presented ≥G4 events. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of IRRs. IRRs 
should be managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation, prophylaxis and appropriate 
treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
ADRs: The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions observed in patients treated with T+D+SoC 
(n=330) in the POSEIDON trial were anaemia (49.7%), nausea (41.5%), neutropenia (41.2%), fatigue 
(36.1%), rash (25.8%) thrombocytopenia (24.5%), and diarrhoea (21.5%). The most common  (> 
2%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions were neutropenia (23.9%), anaemia (20.6%), pneumonia (9.4%), 
thrombocytopenia (8.2%), leukopenia (5.5%), fatigue (5.2%), lipase increased (3.9%), amylase 
increased (3.6%), febrile neutropenia (2.4%), colitis (2.1%) and aspartate aminotransferase 
increased/alanine aminotransferase increased (2.1%).  
SAEs: Pneumonia was the most frequent SAE in the trial, and its incidence in the T+D+SoC arm 
doubled that of the control arm SoC (11% vs. 5%). As expected, myelotoxic events (anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia), likely related to chemotherapy, 
were also frequent in all three arms of the trial, with comparable incidence among them. 
Noting that diarrhoea and colitis are important identified risks of anti-CTLA-4 agent ipilimumab, it is of 
no surprise that the number of patients with serious diarrhoea was higher in the T+D+SoC arm (8 
patients), as compared to the other two arms (1 each) of the pivotal trial, pointing out the potential 
pathophysiologic role of CTLA-4 block in the development of serious immune-mediated 
diarrhoea/colitis. To support this hypothesis, the incidence of this SAE was nearly identical across the 
T+D+SoC arm (2.4%), and the T+D+chemo and T+D pools (2.5% in each). Data for colitis, slightly 
less prevalent, mimics this pattern. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
colitis/diarrhoea and intestinal perforation and managed through dose interruption, treatment 
discontinuation and/or corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Serious pneumonitis, with a likely immune-mediated background –known imAE from durvalumab– 
occurred almost exclusively in the experimental arms (6 cases in T+D+SoC, 5 in D+SoC, 1 in SoC). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should 
be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 124/134 
 
 
 
and managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and corticosteroid treatment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Deaths: Regardless of causality, there were 41 AEs leading to death in the T+D+SoC arm, 34 in the 
D+SoC arm and 30 in the SoC arm. The most frequent category (system organ class) of AEs leading to 
death across all three arms of POSEIDON was infections and infestations (15, 8 and 9, respectively), 
with 7 events of fatal pneumonia in each arm (although there was another event of fatal respiratory 
tract infection in the T+D+SoC arm). Cardiac disorders followed in frequency as AEs with outcome of 
death, again with almost twice as many occurrences in the T+D+SoC arm, as compared to the other 
two arms: 8, 4 and 5, respectively. On the other hand, fatal events of pulmonary embolism occurred 
much frequently in the control arm: 1, 3 and 5, respectively.  
Laboratory findings: Shifts in haematological parameters were comparable between the T+D+SoC and 
SoC arms of the pivotal trial. Increases of ALT/AST/bilirubin were noticeably higher in the T+D+SoC 
arm across different categories. This parallels the overall higher incidence of hepatobiliary disorders 
(8.2% patients in the T+D+SoC arm vs. 3.3% in the SoC arm). Paradoxically, a potential Hy’s law 
definition was met in more patients from the SoC arm (9) as compared to the T+D+SoC arm (3). 
Incidence of AE of hypothyroidism was declared in 11.8% in the T+D+SoC arm, 6.3% in the D+SoC 
arm and 1.2% in the SoC arm (p. 190/9160 ISS), highlighting likely immune-mediated 
pathophysiology in relationship to the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The true incidence of 
subclinical –likely immune-mediated– hypothyroidism is probably higher, as the table on abnormal 
thyroid tests suggest, elevated TSH was evident in 31% of patients from the T+D+SoC arm, vs. 28 in 
the D+SoC arm, and 24% in the SoC arm. Patients should be monitored for abnormal thyroid function 
tests prior to and periodically during treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Immune-
mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis should be managed through dose 
interruption, symptomatic treatment or thyroid hormone replacement as clinically indicated (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Immune mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination 
with durvalumab. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency. For symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, patients should be managed through dose 
interruption, corticoisteroid treatment and hormone replacement (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC). 
Immune mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can first present as diabetic ketoacidosis that can be 
fatal if not detected early, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of type 1 
diabetes mellitus. For symptomatic type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients should be managed via treatment 
with insulin as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or hypopituitarism. For 
symptomatic hypophysitis or hypopituitarism, patients should be managed as recommended through 
dose interruption and corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Individual patient listings of ECG values have been provided. The risk of QT prolongation in relationship 
to tremelimumab appears low. 
AEs by age subgroups: In the POSEIDON study in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination 
with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, some differences in safety were reported 
between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients. The safety data from patients 75 years of age or 
older are limited to a total of 74 patients. There was a higher frequency of serious adverse reactions 
and discontinuation of any study treatment due to adverse reactions in 35 patients aged 75 years of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 125/134 
 
 
 
age or older treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy (45.7% and 28.6%, respectively) relative to 39 patients aged 75 years of age or older 
who received platinum-based chemotherapy only (35.9% and 20.5%, respectively). Careful 
consideration of the potential benefit/risk of this regimen on an individual basis is recommended (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Overview of AEs by subgroups of other intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics does not show a specific 
pattern of safety concerns in a subgroup of considerable size. Data on safety by weight quartiles does 
not suggest major differences except for a higher incidence of maximum CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 in the 
subgroup of patients with the lowest body weight (i.e. <57 kg). However, a particular toxicity trend for 
the occurrence of high-grade events was not observed. 
AEs by ADA status: The proportions of patients with anti-tremelimumab antibodies in the T+D+SoC 
arm and T+D pan-tumour pool were similar (16% and 13%, respectively), but those for anti-
durvalumab antibodies were higher in POSEIDON (15% and 6%, respectively). The incidence of AEs 
across the diverse categories did not differ significantly for patients defined as ADA+ or ADA- 
(durvalumab in both experimental arms and tremelimumab in arm T+D+SoC). 
AEs leading to discontinuation: The overall proportion of patients that discontinued any treatment in 
the context of an AE was higher in the experimental arms (22% in T+D+SoC, 20% in D+SoC) than in 
the control arm (15%). The main AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment across the three 
arms of POSEIDON were pneumonia, anaemia and acute kidney injury. The addition of tremelimumab 
or durvalumab does not translate into a higher rate of AEs leading to dose reduction of chemotherapy. 
There are no data on the use of tremelimumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, 
tremelimumab has the potential to impact maintenance of pregnancy and may cause foetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. Tremelimumab is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 
months after the last dose.  
There is no information regarding the presence of tremelimumab in human milk, the absorption and 
effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG2 is excreted in human 
milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions from tremelimumab in breast-fed infants, breast-
feeding women are advised not to breast-feed during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last 
dose. 
Tremelimumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Regardless of causality, all AEs categories (high-grade, serious, AEs leading to death or to treatment 
discontinuation, AESIs/imAEs) occurred in a numerically higher proportion of patients from the 
T+D+SoC arm as compared to the other two arms of pivotal trial POSEIDON. 
Undoubtedly, the addition of double checkpoint inhibition (PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to a backbone platinum 
doublet imposes higher overall toxicity in the targeted population, which must be considered in the 
context of frail patients, particularly those of advanced age or multiple comorbidities. Immune-
mediated events are the main concern from the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab: 
although most were manageable and did not considerably impact long-term clinical outcome (e.g. 
endocrinopathies, hepatotoxicity and rash/dermatitis), others constitute serious entities with a 
significant symptomatic burden (diarrhoea/colitis, pneumonitis), representing a considerable hazard to 
the wellbeing of patients in this palliative setting. To minimise the risk of immune-mediated adverse 
reactions, the distribution of a patient card has been established as an additional risk minimisation

Additional risk minimisation measures 
The distribution of a patient card has been established as an additional risk minimisation measure for 
IMJUDO. This patient card aims to raise awareness of potential symptoms of immune-mediated 
adverse reactions associated with the use of IMJUDO, promoting early detection and facilitating prompt 
management. This will reduce the clinical impact of immune-mediated adverse reactions. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the 
SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The adverse drug reactions table in section 4.8 (Table 3) has been updated to present safety 
information relating to HCC and NSCLC indications. The frequency of adverse reactions previously 
categorized as ‘not known’ has been revised based on the pool of 3319 patients (T75+D pool). 
Additionally, section 5.3 has been updated to include a range for the exposure-based safety margin to 
clinical exposure (1.77-5.33), due to the different population PK reports used to calculate safety 
margins for HCC and NSCLC indications.  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the Applicant. The changes to the package leaflet are minimal and were 
already reviewed in the context of the Tremelimumab AstraZeneca MA. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved therapeutic indication is: 
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-
line treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no sensitising EGFR 
mutations or ALK positive mutations. 
The aim of added tremelimumab in the targeted population is to prolong overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS).

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The first line (1L) treatment of metastatic NSCLC has evolved from cytotoxic chemotherapies based on 
physician’s preference to a hallmark of personalized medicine, with subsets of patients treated 
according to the genetic alterations of their tumour and PD-L1 status, which predict for benefit from 
targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), respectively. 
For patients without genetic drivers (e.g. EGFR, ALK, ROS1), treatment selection in clinical practice is 
usually based on PD-L1 expression or histology. For patients with high PD-L1 expression (i.e., PD-L1 
expressed in ≥50% of tumour cells), monotherapy with either pembrolizumab or atezolizumab or 
cemiplimab are acceptable approved. Conversely, regardless of PD-L1 expression, a series of 
combinations of immunotherapy with histology-selected platinum-based chemotherapy have also 
shown survival benefits, which led to EMA approval: 
• 
• 
Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel for squamous histology 
Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + pemetrexed for non-squamous histology 
•  Atezolizumab + bevacizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
•  Atezolizumab + carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
•  Nivolumab + ipilimumab + 2 cycles of platinum-doublet, regardless of histology 
Although immunochemotherapy treatments are the 1L standard-of-care in patients with advanced 
metastatic NSCLC whose tumours do not harbour driver mutations, new treatment options are 
required that can explore the potential of immunotherapy strategies and benefit a broader patient 
population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
POSEIDON is a phase III, three-arm, randomised, multi-centre, open-label study in patients with 
metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK aberrations, which compared durvalumab + chemotherapy 
(D+SoC, n=338) and tremelimumab + durvalumab + chemotherapy (T+D+SoC, n=338) to standard-
of-care histology-specific platinum-based chemotherapy (SoC, n=337). 
The dual primary endpoints of BICR-PFS and OS were analysed in the ITT of the D+SoC vs. SoC arms, 
while identical secondary endpoints were evaluated in the ITT of the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary OS endpoint (D+SoC vs SoC) in study POSEIDON did not meet statistical significance. 
However, the other primary PFS endpoint that compared the same arms showed statistical superiority 
and thus alpha was propagated to the next testing level, in which OS and PFS were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints in the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms. 
•  At data cutoff 12-MAR-2021 and with median survival follow-up of 12.5 months, 800 deaths had 
occurred (79% of OS maturity) in the ITT population. Treatment with T+D+SoC showed a 
statistically significant survival benefit as compared with SoC: HR for OS was 0.77 (95% CI 0.65, 
0.92), p-value 0.00304. K-M estimates of median OS were 14.0 months in the T+D+SoC arm and 
11.7 months in the SoC arm. 
•  At data cutoff 24-JUL-2019, 749 PFS events (74% maturity) had occurred across the three arms of 
the trial. K-M estimated median PFS was numerically higher in the T+D+SoC arm (6.2 months) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 129/134 
 
 
 
than in the SoC arm (4.8 months), while HR for PFS outlines the statistical advantage from 
T+D+SoC vs. SoC: 0.72 (95% CI 0.60, 0.86), p-value 0.00031. 
•  Secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR and PFS2 endorsed the advantage of T+D+SoC over SoC, as did 
subgroup and diverse sensitivity analyses. 
• 
The benefit of T+D+SoC vs. SoC –in terms of OS, PFS and ORR– is maintained regardless of PD-L1 
expression status, i.e., above and below various PD-L1 cutoffs (1%, 25%, 50%). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  Acknowledging differences in study design –particularly selection of squamous (SQ) or non-
squamous (NSQ) histologies or allowing both– and limitations from cross-trial comparisons, it is 
noted that longer median survival was observed in akin studies in which only anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
agents were added to backbone platinum-based chemotherapy in the experimental arm. 
• 
• 
Even if the combination of T+D+SoC has demonstrated an improvement in OS, PFS and ORR 
compared with the SoC alone, the contribution of tremelimumab to this effect appears marginal in 
view of the results of a descriptive comparison with D+SoC. Since these analyses were not 
statistically powered, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. 
The OS benefit of T+D+SoC over SoC seems minimal in Asian patients and non-smokers. Of note, 
the smaller effect in the subgroup of non-smoker patients has already been observed in prior 
studies with immunotherapy. However, both subgroups were less represented in the T+D+SoC 
arm compared with the SoC arm. 
• 
In elderly patients (≥75 years of age) a HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.71) for OS was reported for 
T+D+SoC (n=35) vs. SoC (n=40). The uncertainty regarding efficacy (and safety) in this subgroup 
of patients is reflected in the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  AEs occurred in almost all patients across the three arms of POSEIDON. While high-grade (G3/4) 
AEs occurred in about half of the patients from each arm, G5 AEs were slightly more frequent in 
the experimental arms (12% in T+D+SoC, 10% D+SoC, 9% SoC), as were SAEs (44%, 40% and 
35%, respectively) and AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment (22%, 24% and 15%, 
respectively). 
• 
• 
Typical chemotherapy-related AEs (anaemia, nausea, neutropenia, decreased appetite and fatigue) 
were the five most frequent AEs across the three arms of the trial, with slightly higher incidence in 
the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the SoC arm. Diarrhoea and rash, with potentially immune-
related pathophysiology, were considerably more frequent in the T+D+SoC arm than in the SoC 
arm (22% and 19% vs. 15% and 7%, respectively).  
The higher incidence of G≥3 AEs in the T+D+SoC arm (66% vs. 61% in SoC) is driven by G5 AEs 
(12.4% and 9%, respectively). The proportions of the most frequent G3/4 AEs were overall similar 
across the three arms of the trial, highlighting events of chemotherapy-related myelotoxicity, 
increases in pancreatic and hepatic enzymes and pneumonia.  
•  Regarding causality of AEs, it is difficult to elucidate which events could be caused by the 
chemotherapy component and which ones could be related to tremelimumab and/or durvalumab. 
Incidence of AEs reported with a ≥5% difference between both arms were: neutropenia (30.0% vs 
23.4%), diarrhoea (21.5% vs. 15.3%), rash (19.4% vs. 6.6%), pyrexia (16.1% vs. 6.9%),

arthralgia (12.4% vs. 6.3%), hypothyroidism (11.8% vs. 1.2%), pruritus (10.9% vs. 4.5%), and 
hyperthyroidism (5.8% vs. 0.6%).  
There were 41 AEs leading to death (G5 AEs) in the T+D+SoC arm, 34 in the D+SoC arm and 30 
in the SoC arm. Most of these events were related to infections and cardiac disorders, noting that 
twice as many toxic deaths from infections occurred in the T+D+SoC arm, as compared to the 
other two arms (15, 8 and 9, respectively).  
The proportion of patients with imAEs was 32% in the T+D+SoC arm, 17% in the D+SoC and 4% 
in the SoC arm. The distribution of specific imAEs in the D+SoC arm is typical for PD-L1 inhibition, 
with predominance of hypothyroidism (6%), hepatotoxicity (3%), pneumonitis (3%) and 
dermatitis/rash (2%). The T+D+SoC arm presented twice as many cases of immune-mediated 
diarrhoea/colitis than the D+SoC arm (14 vs. 6) and more cases of pneumonitis (14 vs. 9). 
Hypothyroidism was more frequent in the T+D+SoC arm (12%) than in the D+SoC (6%) or SoC 
(1%) arms.  
Pneumonia was the most frequent SAE in the trial, and its incidence in the T+D+SoC arm doubled 
that of the control arm SoC (11% vs. 5%). Serious myelotoxic events, likely related to 
chemotherapy, were also frequent in all three arms of the trial, with comparable incidence among 
them. Serious pneumonitis and colitis/diarrhoea were more prevalent in the T+D+SoC arm than in 
the other two arms.  
The overall proportion of patients that discontinued any treatment in the context of an AE was 
higher in the experimental arms (22% in T+D+SoC, 20% in D+SoC) than in the control arm 
(15%). The main AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment across the three arms of 
POSEIDON were pneumonia, anaemia and acute kidney injury.  
Patients who were 75 years or older (11% from the pivotal trial) presented a significantly higher 
proportion of SAEs (74% in T+D+SoC vs. 56% SoC), high-grade AEs (71% vs. 64%), G5 AEs 
(40% vs. 14%) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (49% vs. 23%) as compared to their 
younger counterparts. Caution should be exerted when considering treatment of tremelimumab + 
durvalumab + chemotherapy in patients older than 75 years. A specific warning in sections 4.4 and 
4.8 was inserted.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The addition of immune checkpoint inhibition (PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4) to a platinum doublet has 
proven successful at prolonging survival in advanced driver-negative NSCLC: a series of trials 
conducted concurrently in the last few years –the majority depicting add-on design with platinum-
based chemotherapy as control– have shown improved efficacy outcomes of the experimental arms. 
Indeed, current guidelines across the globe highlight a plethora of immunochemotherapy regimens 
that are recommended for the initial approach in a treatment-naïve setting. While most of these 
combinations are appropriate regardless of tumoural PD-L1 expression, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as 
monotherapy are also adequate choices for high-expressors (≥50% of tumour cells). 
Albeit strictly unsuccessful for its primary OS endpoint in the D+SoC vs. SoC arms, the overall efficacy 
outcome of pivotal trial POSEIDON parallels results of other similar studies, noting statistically 
improved OS and PFS for the T+D+SoC vs. SoC comparisons. Upon appropriate maturity of the 
database, beneficial effects were observed across different PD-L1 cut-offs. Importantly, however, the 
exploratory comparisons between the experimental arms seem to suggest a borderline efficacious 
advantage of the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab and chemotherapy, challenging the clinical 
relevance of double immune checkpoint inhibition, especially in the light of added immune toxicity 
risks. 
As thoroughly depicted in the safety section, all the categories of adverse events present numerically 
higher incidence in the experimental arms, particularly in the 4-drug combination implied in the 
therapeutic indication of tremelimumab. As expected, immune-mediated events prevailed in both 
experimental arms, and although the majority were low-grade and manageable (e.g. hypothyroidism, 
rash), potentially symptomatic events (e.g. diarrhoea/colitis, pneumonitis) occurred predominantly in 
the tremelimumab arm. Undeniably, if dual PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibition plus chemotherapy are

EMA/CHMP/213841/2023  
Page 132/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
considered for advanced NSCLC, toxicity and tolerability concerns are to be taken into account, 
particularly for more frail or elderly patients. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy data from the POSEIDON trial are sufficiently mature: it seems unlikely that updated results 
would alter the current conclusions. 
Although the combination of tremelimumab, durvalumab and platinum-based does not seem to fill an 
unmet medical need in the current therapeutic paradigm of advanced NSCLC, it could be considered 
another appropriate chemoimmunotherapy regimen in this palliative setting. 
The addition of tremelimumab and durvalumab to chemotherapy results in considerably increased 
toxicity, in particular relating to higher incidence of serious and grade 5 adverse events. Furthermore, 
the symptomatic burden and safety risks from immune-mediate events whose incidence raise with 
CTLA-4 blockade –e.g. colitis/diarrhoea, pneumonitis– are a particular concern from added 
tremelimumab. Special caution must be exerted when considering this regimen for patients ≥75 years. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic NSCLC with no sensitising EGFR 
mutations or ALK positive mutations is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.

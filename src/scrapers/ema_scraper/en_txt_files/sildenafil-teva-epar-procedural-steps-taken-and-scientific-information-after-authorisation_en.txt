on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Sildenafil teva continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
benefit risk profile of Sildenafil teva continues to be 
favourable in the treatment of adult men with erectile 
dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a 
penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual 
performance. In order for Sildenafil teva to be effective, 
sexual stimulation is required. The CHMP recommended the 
renewal of the Marketing Authorisation with unlimited 
validity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Jorveza is indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults (older than 18 years 
of age). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The treatment with this medicinal product should be initiated by a gastroenterologist or a physician 
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. 
Posology 
Induction of remission 
The recommended daily dose is 2 mg budesonide as one 1-mg-tablet in the morning and one 1-mg-
tablet in the evening.  
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The usual duration of induction treatment is 6 weeks. For patients who are not appropriately 
responding during 6 weeks the treatment can be extended to up to 12 weeks. 
Maintenance of remission 
The recommended daily dose is 1 mg budesonide as one 0.5-mg-tablet in the morning and one 0.5-mg-
tablet in the evening or 2 mg budesonide as one 1-mg-tablet in the morning and one 1-mg-tablet in the 
evening, depending on the individual clinical requirement of the patient.   
A maintenance dose of 1 mg budesonide twice daily is recommended for patients with a long standing 
disease history and/or high extent of esophageal inflammation in their acute disease state, see also 
section 5.1. 
The duration of maintenance therapy is determined by the treating physician.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
There are currently no data available for patients with renal impairment. Because budesonide is not 
excreted via the kidneys, patients with mild to moderate impairment may be treated with caution with 
the same doses as patients without renal impairment. Budesonide is not recommended for use in 
patients with severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
During treatment of patients with hepatic impairment with other budesonide containing medicinal 
products, budesonide levels were increased. However, no systematic study investigating different 
levels of hepatic impairment is available. Patients with hepatic impairment should not be treated (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Jorveza in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Oral use. 
The orodispersible tablet should be taken immediately once removed from the blister package. 
The orodispersible tablet should be taken after a meal. 
It should be placed on the tip of the tongue and gently pressed against the top of the mouth, where it 
will disintegrate. This will usually take at least two minutes but can take up to 20 minutes. The 
effervescence process of the tablet starts after Joreveza comes into contact with saliva and stimulates 
the production of further saliva. The budesonide-loaded saliva should be swallowed little by little 
while the orodispersible tablet disintegrates. The orodispersible tablet should not be taken with liquid 
or food. 
There should be at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking or performing oral hygiene. Any oral 
solutions, sprays or chewable tablets should be used at least 30 minutes before or after administration 
of Jorveza. 
The orodispersible tablet should not be chewed or swallowed undissolved. These measures ensure 
optimal exposure of the esophageal mucosa to the active substance by using the adhesive 
characteristics of mucins in the saliva.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Infections 
Suppression of the inflammatory response and immune function increases the susceptibility to 
infections and their severity. Symptoms of infections can be atypical or masked.  
In clinical studies conducted with Jorveza oral, oropharyngeal and esophageal candida infections have 
been observed with a high frequency (see section 4.8). 
If indicated, symptomatic candidiasis of the mouth and throat can be treated with topical or systemic 
anti-fungal therapy whilst still continuing treatment with Jorveza. 
Chickenpox, herpes zoster and measles can have a more serious course in patients treated with 
glucocorticosteroids. In patients who have not had these diseases, the vaccination status should be 
checked, and particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. 
Vaccines 
The co-administration of live vaccines and glucocorticosteroids should be avoided as this is likely to 
reduce the immune response to vaccines. The antibody response to other vaccines may be diminished. 
Special populations 
Patients with tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, glaucoma, 
cataract, family history of diabetes or family history of glaucoma may be at higher risk of 
experiencing systemic glucocorticosteroid adverse reactions (see below and section 4.8) and should 
therefore be monitored for the occurrence of such effects. 
Reduced liver function may affect the elimination of budesonide, causing higher systemic exposure. 
The risk of adverse reactions (systemic glucocorticosteroid effects) will be increased. However, no 
systematic data are available. Patients with hepatic impairment should therefore not be treated. 
Systemic effects of glucocorticosteroids 
Systemic effects of glucocorticosteroids (e.g., Cushing’s syndrome, adrenal suppression, growth 
retardation, cataract, glaucoma, decreased bone mineral density and a wide range of psychiatric 
effects) may occur (see also section 4.8). These adverse reactions depend on the duration of treatment, 
concomitant and previous glucocorticosteroid treatment and the individual sensitivity. 
Angioedema 
Angioedema has been reported with the use of Jorveza, mostly as part of allergic reactions which 
included rash and itching. If signs of angioedema are observed, the treatment should be stopped. 
Visual disturbance 
Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents 
with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for 
referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma 
or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use 
of systemic and topical corticosteroids. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Others 
Glucocorticosteroids may cause suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and 
reduce the stress response. When patients are subject to surgery or other stresses, supplementary 
systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment is therefore recommended. 
Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole or other CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided (see 
section 4.5). 
Interference with serological testing 
Because adrenal function may be suppressed by treatment with budesonide, an ACTH stimulation test 
for diagnosing pituitary insufficiency might show false results (low values).  
Sodium content 
Jorveza 0.5 mg and 1 mg orodispersible tablets contain 52 mg of sodium per daily dose, equivalent to 
2.6% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Co-treatment with potent CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, cobicistat and grapefruit juice may cause a marked increase of the plasma 
concentration of budesonide and is expected to increase the risk of systemic adverse reactions. 
Therefore, concomitant use should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of 
systemic corticosteroid adverse reactions, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic 
corticosteroid adverse reactions.  
Ketoconazole 200 mg once daily orally increased the plasma concentration of budesonide (3 mg single 
dose) approximately 6-fold during concomitant administration. When ketoconazole was administered 
approximately 12 hours after budesonide, the plasma concentration of budesonide increased 
approximately 3-fold. 
Oestrogens, oral contraceptives 
Elevated plasma concentrations and enhanced effects of glucocorticosteroids have been reported in 
women also receiving oestrogens or oral contraceptives. No such effect has been observed with 
budesonide and concomitant intake of low-dose combination oral contraceptives. 
Cardiac glycosides 
The action of glycoside can be potentiated by potassium deficiency which is a potential and known 
adverse reaction of glucocorticoids.  
Saluretics  
Concommitant use of glucocorticoids may result in enhanced potassium excretion and aggravated 
hypokalaemia. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Administration during pregnancy should be avoided unless there are compelling reasons for therapy 
with Jorveza. There are few data of pregnancy outcomes after oral administration of budesonide in 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
humans. Although data on the use of inhaled budesonide in a large number of exposed pregnancies 
indicate no adverse effect, the maximal concentration of budesonide in plasma has to be expected to 
be higher in the treatment with Jorveza compared to inhaled budesonide. In pregnant animals, 
budesonide, like other glucocorticosteroids, has been shown to cause abnormalities of fetal 
development (see section 5.3). The relevance of this to man has not been established.  
Breast-feeding 
Budesonide is excreted in human milk (data on excretion after inhalative use is available). However, 
only minor effects on the breast-fed child are anticipated after oral use of Jorveza within the 
therapeutic range. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to 
discontinue/abstain from Jorveza therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child 
and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of budesonide on human fertility. Fertility was unaffected following 
budesonide treatment in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Jorveza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Fungal infections in the mouth, pharynx and the oesophagus were the most frequently observed 
adverse reactions in clinical studies with Jorveza. In the clinical studies BUL-1/EEA and BUL-2/EER, 
a total of 44 out of 268 patients (16.4%) exposed to Jorveza experienced cases of suspected fungal 
infections associated with clinical symptoms, which were all of mild or moderate intensity. The total 
number of infections (including those diagnosed by endoscopy and histology without symptoms) was 
92, occurring in 72 out of 268 patients (26.9%). Long-term treatment with Jorveza of up to 3 years 
(48-weeks in the BUL-2/EER followed by 96-week open-label treatment) did not increase the rate of 
side effects including local candidiasis.   
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions observed in clinical studies with Jorveza are listed in the table below, by MedDRA 
system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antidiarrheals, intestinal antiinflammatory/antiinfective agents, 
corticosteroids acting locally, ATC code: A07EA06 
Mechanism of action 
Budesonide is a non-halogenated glucocorticosteroid, which acts primarily anti-inflammatory via 
binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. In the treatment of EoE with Jorveza, budesonide inhibits 
antigen-stimulated secretion of many pro-inflammatory signal molecules such as thymic stromal 
lymphopoeitin, interleukin-13 and eotaxin-3 in the esophageal epithelium, which results in a 
significant reduction of the esophageal eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III clinical study (BUL-1/EEA) including 88 
adult patients with active EoE (randomisation rate: 2:1), 1 mg budesonide given twice daily as an 
orodispersible tablet for 6 weeks induced clinico-pathologic remission (defined as both peak of 
< 16 eosinophils/mm2 high power field in esophageal biopsies and no or only minimal symptoms of 
dysphagia or pain during swallowing) in 34 out of 59 patients (57.6%) versus 0/29 patients (0%) in the 
placebo-group. Open-label extension of the treatment with 1 mg budesonide orodispersible tablet 
twice daily for further 6 weeks in patients without remission in the double-blind phase increased the 
rate of patients with clinico-pathologic remission to 84.7%.  
In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III clinical study (BUL-2/EER) including 
204 adult patients with EoE in clinico-pathological remission, patients were randomised to treatment 
with 0.5 mg budesonide twice daily (BID), 1 mg budesonide BID, or placebo (all given as 
orodispersible tablets) for 48 weeks. Primary endpoint was the rate of patients free of treatment failure 
with treatment failure defined as clinical relapse (severity of dysphagia or pain during swallowing 
of ≥4 points on a 0-10 nummerical rating scale, respectively), and/or histological relapse (peak 
of ≥ 48 eosinophils/mm2 high power field), and/or food impaction requiring endoscopic intervention, 
and/or need of an endoscopic dilation, and/or premature withdrawal for any reason. Significantly more 
patients in the 0.5 mg BID (73.5%) group and the 1 mg BID (75.0%) group were free of treatment 
failure at week 48 compared to placebo (4.4%).  
The most stringent secondary endpoint “deep disease remission”, i.e., deep clinical, deep endoscopic 
and histological remission showed a clinically relevant higher efficacy in the 1 mg BID group (52.9%) 
compared to the 0.5 mg BID group (39.7%), indicating that a higher dose of budesonide is of 
advantage to achieve and maintain deep disease remission.  
The double-blind period was followed by an optional 96-week open-label treatment with a 
recommended dose of 0.5 mg budesonide BID or up to 1 mg budesonide BID. More than 80% of the 
patients maintained clinical remission (defined as weekly Eosinophilic Esophagitis Activity 
Index-Pro ≤ 20) over the 96-week period, while only 2/166 patients (1.2%) experienced a food 
impaction. In addition, 40/49 patients (81.6%) maintained deep histological remission 
(0 eosinophils/mm2 high power field in all biopsies) from baseline of study BUL-2/EER to the end of 
treatment of the 96-week open-label period. Over a period of up to 3 years (i.e., 96-week open-label 
treatment with Jorveza, following a 48-week double-blind maintenance treatment with Jorveza) no 
loss of efficacy was observed. 
For information about the observed adverse reactions, see section 4.8.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following administration of Jorveza, budesonide is rapidly absorbed. Pharmacokinetic data following 
administration of single doses of 1 mg budesonide to fasted healthy subjects in two different studies 
show a median lag time of 0.17 hours (range 0.00 - 0.52 hours) and a median time to peak plasma 
concentration of 1.00 - 1.22 hours (range 0.50 - 2.00 hours). The mean peak plasma concentration was 
0.44 - 0.49 ng/mL (range 0.18 - 1.05 ng/mL) and the area under the plasma-concentration-time curve 
(AUC0-∞) was 1.50 - 2.23 hr*ng/mL (range 0.81 - 5.14 hr*ng/mL).  
Single dose pharmacokinetic data in fasted patients with EoE are available with 4 mg budesonide: 
Median lag-time was 0.00 hours (range 0.00 – 0.17), median time to peak plasma concentration was 
1.00 hour (range 0.67 – 2.00 hours); peak plasma concentration was 2.56 ± 1.36 ng/mL, and AUC0-12 
was 8.96 ± 4.21 hr*ng/mL. 
Patients showed a 35% increase in peak plasma concentrations and a 60% increase in AUC0-12 
compared to healthy subjects. 
Dose proportionality of the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) from 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets to 
1 mg orodispersible tablets has been demonstrated.  
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution following oral administration of 1 mg budesonide to healthy 
subjects was 35.52 ± 14.94 L/kg and 42.46 ± 23.90 L/kg following administration of 4 mg budesonide 
to patients with EoE. Plasma protein binding is on average 85-90%. 
Biotransformation 
Metabolism of budesonide is decreased in EoE patients compared to healthy subjects resulting in 
increased plasma concentrations of budesonide. 
Budesonide undergoes extensive biotransformation by CYP3A4 in the mucosa of the small intestine 
and in the liver to metabolites of low glucocorticosteroid activity. The glucocorticosteroid activity of 
the major metabolites, 6β-hydroxybudesonide and 16α-hydroxyprednisolone, is less than 1% of that of 
budesonide. CYP3A5 does not contribute significantly to the metabolism of budesonide. 
Elimination 
The median elimination half-life is 2 - 3 hours in healthy subjects (receiving 1 mg budesonide) and 
4 - 5 hours in EoE patients (receiving 4 mg budesonide). Clearance of budesonide is about 
13 – 15 L/hour/kg in healthy subjects and 6.54 ± 4.4 L/hour/kg in EoE patients. Budesonide is 
eliminated only in marginal if any amounts by the kidney. No budesonide, but only budesonide 
metabolites were detected in urine. 
Hepatic impairment 
A relevant proportion of budesonide is metabolised in the liver by CYP3A4. The systemic exposure of 
budesonide is considerably increased in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. No studies 
have been conducted with Jorveza in patients with impaired liver function.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data in acute, subchronic and chronic toxicological studies with budesonide showed 
atrophies of the thymus gland and adrenal cortex and a reduction especially of lymphocytes. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Budesonide had no mutagenic effects in a number of in vitro and in vivo tests.  
A slightly increased number of basophilic hepatic foci were observed in chronic rat studies with 
budesonide, and in carcinogenicity studies, an increased incidence of primary hepatocellular 
neoplasms, astrocytomas (in male rats) and mammary tumours (female rats) were observed. These 
tumours are probably due to the specific steroid receptor action, increased metabolic burden and 
anabolic effects on the liver, effects which are also known from other glucocorticosteroids in rat 
studies and therefore represent a class effect in this species. 
Budesonide had no effect on fertility in rats. In pregnant animals, budesonide, like other 
glucocorticosteroids, has been shown to cause foetal death and abnormalities of foetal development 
(smaller litter size, intrauterine growth retardation of foetuses and skeletal abnormalities). Some 
glucocorticoids have been reported to produce cleft palate in animals. The clinical relevance of these 
findings to man has not been established (see section 4.6).

1.  What Jorveza is and what it is used for 
Jorveza contains the active substance budesonide, a corticosteroid medicine that reduces inflammation. 
It is used in adults (older than 18 years of age) to treat eosinophilic oesophagitis, which is an 
inflammatory condition of the gullet (food pipe) that causes problems with swallowing food. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Jorveza

if you are allergic to budesonide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Jorveza if you have: 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
tuberculosis 
high blood pressure 
diabetes, or if somebody in your family has diabetes 
weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) 
ulcers in the stomach or first part of the small intestine (peptic ulcer) 
increased pressure in your eye (which can cause glaucoma) or eye problems such as clouding of 
the lens (cataracts) or if somebody in your family has glaucoma 
liver disease. 
− 
If you have any of the conditions mentioned above you may be at increased risk of side effects. Your 
doctor will decide on the appropriate measures and if it is still all right for you to take this medicine. 
If you develop swelling of your face, particularly around your mouth (lips, tongue or throat) and/or 
difficulties to breathe or swallow, stop taking Jorveza and contact your doctor immediately. These 
may be signs of an allergic reaction, which may also include rash and itching (see also section 4). 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Jorveza may cause typical side effects of corticosteroid medicines and may affect all parts of the body, 
particularly when you take this medicine at high doses and over a long time (see section 4). 
Further precautions during treatment with Jorveza 
− 
Contact your doctor if you get blurred vision or have other problems with your vision. 
Take the following precautions during treatment with Jorveza because your immune system may be 
weakened: 
− 
Tell your doctor if you get fungal infections in the mouth, throat and gullet or if you think you 
have any infection during treatment with this medicine. Symptoms of fungal infection can be 
white spots in the mouth and throat and difficulty in swallowing. The symptoms of some 
infections can be unusual or less noticeable. 
Keep away from people who have chickenpox or herpes zoster (shingles) if you have not had 
these infections. The effects of these illnesses can be much more severe during treatment with 
this medicine. If you do come into contact with chickenpox or shingles, see your doctor straight 
away. Please also report your vaccination status to your doctor. 
Tell your doctor if you have not yet had measles and/or if and when you have received your last 
vaccination for this disease. 
If you need to be vaccinated please speak to your doctor first. 
If you know that you are due to have an operation please tell your doctor that you are taking 
Jorveza. 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Jorveza could affect the results of adrenal function tests (ACTH stimulation test) ordered by your 
doctor or in hospital. Tell your doctors that you are taking Jorveza before you have any tests. 
Children and adolescents 
Jorveza should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of this medicine 
in children younger than 18 years of age has not yet been studied. 
Other medicines and Jorveza 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some of these medicines may increase the effects of Jorveza and your doctor may wish to 
monitor you carefully if you are taking these medicines.  
In particular: 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
ketoconazole or itraconazole (to treat fungal infections) 
clarithromycin, an antibiotic medicine used to treat infections 
ritonavir and cobicistat (to treat HIV infections) 
oestrogens (used for hormone replacement therapy or contraception) 
cardiac glycosides such as digoxin (medicines used to treat heart conditions) 
diuretics (to remove excess fluid from the body). 
Jorveza with food and drink 
You should not drink grapefruit juice whilst you are taking this medicine as this can worsen its side 
effects. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Do not take this medicine during pregnancy without checking with your doctor first. 
Do not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding unless you have checked with your doctor. 
Budesonide passes in small amounts into the breast milk. Your doctor will help you decide whether 
you should continue treatment and not breast-feed or if you should stop treatment over the period your 
baby is being breast-fed. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Jorveza is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Jorveza contains sodium 
This medicine contains 52 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per daily dose. This is 
equivalent to 2.6% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How to take Jorveza 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose for treatment of acute episodes is two 1 mg orodispersible tablets (2 mg 
budesonide) per day. Take one 1 mg orodispersible tablet in the morning and one 1 mg orodispersible 
tablet in the evening. 
The recommended dose for prevention of further episodes is two 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets (1 mg 
budesonide) per day or two 1 mg orodispersible tablets (2 mg budesonide) per day, depending on your 
body’s response to the treatment. Take one orodispersible tablet in the morning and one orodispersible 
tablet in the evening.  
Method of administration 
Take the orodispersible tablet immediately once removed from the blister package.  
Take the orodispersible tablet after a meal. 
Place the orodispersible tablet on the tip of your tongue and close your mouth. Press it gently against 
the roof of your mouth with your tongue until it has disintegrated completely (this usually takes at 
least two minutes but may take up to 20 minutes). Swallow the disintegrated material with saliva little 
by little, as the orodispersible tablet breaks up. 
Do NOT take any liquid with the orodispersible tablet. 
Do not chew or swallow the undisintegrated orodispersible tablet. 
Do not eat, drink, brush your teeth or rinse your mouth for at least 30 minutes after you have taken the 
orodispersible tablet. Do not use any oral solutions, sprays or chewable tablets for at least 30 minutes 
before or after administration of the orodispersible tablet. This will ensure that your medicine works 
properly.  
Kidney and liver problems  
If you have any problem with your kidney or liver, talk to your doctor. If you have a kidney problem, 
your doctor will decide if Jorveza is suitable for you. In case your kidney problems are severe, you 
should not take Jorveza. If you have any liver disease, you should not take Jorveza. 
Duration of treatment 
Initially, your treatment should last about 6 to 12 weeks.  
After treatment of the acute episode, your doctor will decide how long and with which dose you are to 
continue the treatment, depending on your condition and your response to the treatment. 
If you take more Jorveza than you should 
If you have taken more orodispersible tablets than you should, take your next dose as prescribed. Do 
not take a smaller amount. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are in doubt. Take the carton and this 
leaflet with you if possible.  
If you forget to take Jorveza 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you miss a dose, just take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Jorveza 
Speak to your doctor if you want to interrupt or end your treatment early. It is important that you do 
not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor. Keep taking your medicine until your 
doctor tells you to stop, even if you feel better. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

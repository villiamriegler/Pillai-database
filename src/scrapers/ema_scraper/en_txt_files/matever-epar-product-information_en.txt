CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Matever is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without 
secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed 
epilepsy.  
Matever is indicated as adjunctive therapy  
•   in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, 
adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy.  
•   in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with 
Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.  
•   in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 
years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Partial onset seizures 
The recommended dosing for monotherapy (from 16 years of age) and adjunctive therapy is the same; 
as outlined below. 
All indications 
Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more 
The initial therapeutic dose is 500 mg twice daily. This dose can be started on the first day of 
treatment. However, a lower initial dose of 250 mg twice daily may be given based on physician 
assessment  of seizure reduction versus potential side effects. This can be increased to 500 mg twice 
daily after two weeks. 
Depending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the daily dose can be increased up to 1 500 mg 
twice daily. Dose changes can be made in 250 mg or 500 mg twice daily increases or decreases every 
two to four weeks. 
Adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing below 50 kg and children from 1 month of age 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form, presentation and strength 
according to weight, age and dose. Refer to Paediatric population section for dosing adjustments 
based on weight. 
Discontinuation 
If levetiracetam has to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually (e.g. in adults and 
adolescents weighing more than 50 kg: 500 mg decreases twice daily every two to four weeks; in 
infants older than 6 months, children and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg: dose decrease should 
not exceed 10 mg/kg twice daily every two weeks; in infants (less than 6 months): dose decrease 
should not exceed 7 mg/kg twice daily every two weeks).

Special populations 
Elderly (65 years and older) 
Adjustment of the dose is recommended in elderly patients with compromised renal function (see 
“Renal impairment” below). 
Renal impairment 
The daily dose must be individualised according to renal function.  
For adult patients, refer to the following table and adjust the dose as indicated. To use this dosing 
table, an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in ml/min is needed. The CLcr in ml/min 
may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dl) determination, for adults and adolescents weighing 50 
kg or more, using the following formula:  
                               [140-age (years)] x weight (kg) 
CLcr (ml/min) = ----------------------------------------- (x 0.85 for women) 
                               72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl) 
Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows: 
CLcr (ml/min/1.73 m2) = ---------------------------- x 1.73 
CLcr (ml/min) 
BSA subject (m2)

For children with renal impairment, levetiracetam dose needs to be adjusted based on the renal 
function as levetiracetam clearance is related to renal function. This recommendation is based on a 
study in adult renally impaired patients.  
The CLcr in ml/min/1.73 m2 may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dl) determination, for young 
adolescents, children and infants, using the following formula (Schwartz formula):   
  Height (cm) x ks 
CLcr (ml/min/1.73 m2) =  ------------------------------------

ks= 0.45 in Term infants to 1 year old; ks= 0.55 in Children to less than 13 years and in adolescent 
female; ks= 0.7 in adolescent male

-- 
End-stage renal 
disease patients 
undergoing dialysis 
(1) Levetiracetam oral solution should be used for doses under 250 mg, for doses not multiple of 
250 mg when dosing recommendation is not achievable by taking multiple tablets and for patients 
unable to swallow tablets.  
(2) A 10.5 mg/kg (0.105 ml/kg) loading dose is recommended on the first day of treatment with 
levetiracetam. 
 (3) A 15 mg/kg (0.15 ml/kg) loading dose is recommended on the first day of treatment with 
levetiracetam. 
(4) Following dialysis, a 3.5 to 7 mg/kg (0.035 to 0.07 ml/kg) supplemental dose is recommended. 
(5) Following dialysis, a 5 to 10 mg/kg (0.05 to 0.10 ml/kg) supplemental dose is recommended. 
Hepatic impairment  
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with 
severe hepatic impairment, the creatinine clearance may underestimate the renal insufficiency. 
Therefore, a 50 % reduction of the daily maintenance dose is recommended when the creatinine 
clearance is < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
Paediatric population 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form, presentation and strength 
according to age, weight and dose. 
The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years.  An oral 
solution is the preferred formulation for use in this population. In addition, the available dose strengths 
of the tablets are not appropriate for initial treatment in children weighing less than 25 kg, for patients 
unable to swallow tablets or for the administration of doses below 250 mg. In all of the above cases an 
oral solution should be used. 
Monotherapy 
The safety and efficacy of Matever in children and adolescents below 16 years as monotherapy 
treatment have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Adolescents (16 and 17 years of age) weighing 50 kg or more with partial onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalisation with newly diagnosed epilepsy.  
Please refer to the above section on Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 
kg or more.

Add-on therapy for infants aged from 6 to 23 months, children (2 to 11 years) and adolescents (12 to 
17 years) weighing less than 50 kg 
An oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. 
For children 6 years and above, an oral solution should be used for doses under 250 mg, for doses not 
multiple of 250 mg when dosing recommendation is not achievable by taking multiple tablets and for 
patients unable to swallow tablets. 
The lowest effective dose should be used for all indications. The starting dose for a child or adolescent 
of 25 kg should be 250 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily.  
Dose in children 50 kg or greater is the same as in adults for all indications. 
Please refer to the above section on Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 
kg or more for all indications. 
Add-on therapy for infants aged from 1 month to less than 6 months 
The oral solution is the formulation to use in infants. 
Method of administration 
The film-coated tablets must be taken orally, swallowed with a sufficient quantity of liquid and may 
be taken with or without food. After oral administration the bitter taste of levetiracetam may be 
experienced. The daily dose is administered in two equally divided doses. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Renal impairment 
The administration of levetiracetam to patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustment. In 
patients with severely impaired hepatic function, assessment of renal function is recommended before 
dose selection (see section 4.2).  
Acute kidney injury 
The use of levetiracetam has been very rarely associated with acute kidney injury, with a time to onset 
ranging from a few days to several months. 
Blood cell counts 
Rare cases of decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, 
thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia) have been described in association with levetiracetam 
administration, generally at the beginning of the treatment. Complete blood cell counts are advised in 
patients experiencing important weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections or coagulation disorders 
(section 4.8). 
Suicide 
Suicide, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with 
anti-epileptic agents (including levetiracetam). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has shown a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and 
behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known.  
Therefore, patients should be monitored for signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation and 
behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) 
should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation or 
behaviour emerge. 
Abnormal and aggressive behaviours 
Levetiracetam may cause psychotic symptoms and behavioural abnormalities including irritability and 
aggressiveness. Patients treated with levetiracetam should be monitored for developing psychiatric 
signs suggesting important mood and/or personality changes. If such behaviours are noticed, treatment 
adaptation or gradual discontinuation should be considered. If discontinuation is considered, please 
refer to section 4.2. 
Worsening of seizures 
As with other types of antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam may rarely exacerbate seizure frequency or 
severity. This paradoxical effect was mostly reported within the first month after levetiracetam 
initiation or increase of the dose, and was reversible upon drug discontinuation or dose decrease. 
Patients should be advised to consult their physician immediately in case of aggravation of epilepsy.  
Lack of efficacy or seizure worsening has for example been reported in patients with epilepsy 
associated with sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 8 (SCN8A) mutations. 
Electrocardiogram QT interval prolongation 
Rare cases of ECG QT interval prolongation have been observed during the post-marketing 
surveillance. Levetiracetam should be used with caution in patients with QTc-interval prolongation, in 
patients concomitantly treated with drugs affecting the QTc-interval, or in patients with relevant pre-
existing cardiac disease or electrolyte disturbances. 
Paediatric population 
The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years.  
Available data in children did not suggest impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects 
on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children 
remain unknown. 
Excipients 
Matever 250 mg, 750 mg film-coated tablets contain E110 colouring agent which may cause allergic 
reactions. 
Matever  1000  mg  film-coated  tablets  contain  lactose.  Patients  with  rare  hereditary  problems  of 
galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Antiepileptic medicinal products 
Pre-marketing data from clinical studies conducted in adults indicate that levetiracetam did not 
influence the serum concentrations of existing antiepileptic medicinal products (phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, gabapentin and primidone) and that these 
antiepileptic medicinal products did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As in adults, there is no evidence of clinically significant medicinal product interactions in paediatric 
patients receiving up to 60 mg/kg/day levetiracetam.  
A retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic interactions in children and adolescents with epilepsy 
(4 to 17 years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy with orally administered levetiracetam did not 
influence the steady-state serum concentrations of concomitantly administered carbamazepine and 
valproate. However, data suggested a 20 % higher levetiracetam clearance in children taking enzyme-
inducing antiepileptic medicinal products. Dose adjustment is not required.  
Probenecid 
Probenecid (500 mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to 
inhibit the renal clearance of the primary metabolite, but not of levetiracetam. Nevertheless, the 
concentration of this metabolite remains low.  
Methotrexate 
Concomitant administration of levetiracetam and methotrexate has been reported to decrease 
methotrexate clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood methotrexate concentration to 
potentially toxic levels. Blood methotrexate and levetiracetam levels should be carefully monitored in 
patients treated concomitantly with the two medicinal products. 
Oral contraceptives and other pharmacokinetics interactions 
Levetiracetam 1 000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinyl-
estradiol and levonorgestrel); endocrine parameters (luteinizing hormone and progesterone) were not 
modified. -Levetiracetam 2 000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of digoxin and 
warfarin; prothrombin times were not modified. Co-administration with digoxin, oral contraceptives 
and warfarin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.  
Laxatives 
There have been isolated reports of decreased levetiracetam efficacy when the osmotic laxative 
macrogol has been concomitantly administered with oral levetiracetam. Therefore, macrogol should 
not be taken orally for one hour before and for one hour after taking levetiracetam. 
Food and alcohol 
The extent of absorption of levetiracetam was not altered by food, but the rate of absorption was 
slightly reduced.  
No data on the interaction of levetiracetam with alcohol are available. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Specialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. Treatment with 
levetiracetam should be reviewed when a woman is planning to become pregnant. As with all 
antiepileptic medicinal products, sudden discontinuation of levetiracetam should be avoided as this 
may lead to breakthrough seizures that could have serious consequences for the woman and the 
unborn child. Monotherapy should be preferred whenever possible because therapy with multiple 
antiepileptic medicinal products AEDs could be associated with a higher risk of congenital 
malformations than monotherapy, depending on the associated antiepileptics. 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of post-marketing data on pregnant women exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy 
(more than 1 800, among which in more than 1 500 exposure occurred during the 1st trimester) do not 
suggest an increase in the risk for major congenital malformations. Only limited evidence is available 
on the neurodevelopment of children exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy in utero. However, 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
current epidemiological studies (on about 100 children) do not suggest an increased risk of 
neurodevelopmental disorders or delays.  
Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, if after careful assessment it is considered clinically 
needed. In such case, the lowest effective dose is recommended.  
Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. Decrease in 
levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more 
pronounced during the third trimester (up to 60 % of baseline concentration before pregnancy). 
Appropriate clinical management of pregnant women treated with levetiracetam should be ensured.  
Breast-feeding 
Levetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended. 
However, if levetiracetam treatment is needed during breast-feeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment 
should be weighed considering the importance of breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, 
potential risk for human is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Levetiracetam  has  minor  or  moderate  influence  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines.  Due  to 
possible  different individual sensitivity, some patients might experience somnolence or other central 
nervous  system  related  symptoms,  especially  at  the  beginning  of  treatment  or  following  a  dose 
increase.  Therefore,  caution  is  recommended  in  those  patients  when  performing  skilled  tasks,  e.g. 
driving  vehicles  or  operating machinery. Patients are advised not to drive or use machines until it is 
established that their ability to perform such activities is not affected. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis, somnolence, headache, fatigue 
and dizziness. The adverse reaction profile presented below is based on the analysis of pooled 
placebo-controlled clinical trials with all indications studied, with a total of 3 416 patients treated with 
levetiracetam. These data are supplemented with the use of levetiracetam in corresponding open-label 
extension studies, as well as post-marketing experience.  The safety profile of levetiracetam is 
generally similar across age groups (adult and paediatric patients) and across the approved epilepsy 
indications.   
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies (adults, adolescents, children and infants > 1 month) and 
from post-marketing experience are listed in the following table per System Organ Class and per 
frequency. Adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness and their frequency 
is defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 
to<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to<1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000).

* Prevalence is significantly higher in Japanese patients when compared to non-Japanese patients.  
**Very rare cases of development of obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) in patients with 
underlying history of OCD or psychiatric disorders have been observed in post-marketing 
surveillance. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
The risk of anorexia is higher when levetiracetam is co-administered with topiramate. 
In several cases of alopecia, recovery was observed when levetiracetam was discontinued. 
Bone marrow suppression was identified in some of the cases of pancytopenia. 
Cases  of encephalopathy generally occurred at the beginning of the treatment (few days to a few 
months) and were reversible after treatment discontinuation.

In patients aged 1 month to less than 4 years, a total of 190 patients have been treated with 
levetiracetam in placebo-controlled and open label extension studies.  Sixty of these patients were 
treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies.  In patients aged 4-16 years, a total of 645 
patients have been treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled and open label extension studies.  
233 of these patients were treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies. In both these 
paediatric age ranges, these data are supplemented with the post-marketing experience of the use of 
levetiracetam. 
In addition, 101 infants aged less than 12 months have been exposed in a post authorization safety 
study. No new safety concerns for levetiracetam were identified for infants less than 12 months of age 
with epilepsy. 
The adverse reaction profile of levetiracetam is generally similar across age groups and across the 
approved epilepsy indications.  Safety results in paediatric patients in placebo-controlled clinical 
studies were consistent with the safety profile of levetiracetam in adults except for behavioural and 
psychiatric adverse reactions which were more common in children than in adults.  In children and 
adolescents aged 4 to 16 years, vomiting (very common, 11.2%), agitation (common, 3.4%), mood 
swings (common, 2.1%), affect lability (common, 1.7%), aggression (common, 8.2%), abnormal 
behaviour (common, 5.6%), and lethargy (common, 3.9%) were reported more frequently than in other 
age ranges or in the overall safety profile.  In infants and children aged 1 month to less than 4 years, 
irritability (very common, 11.7%) and coordination abnormal (common, 3.3%) were reported more 
frequently than in other age groups or in the overall safety profile.   
A double-blind, placebo-controlled paediatric safety study with a non-inferiority design has assessed 
the cognitive and neuropsychological effects of levetiracetam in children 4 to 16 years of age with 
partial onset seizures. It was concluded that levetiracetam was not different (non inferior) from 
placebo with regard to the change from baseline of the Leiter-R Attention and Memory, Memory 
Screen Composite score in the per-protocol population. Results related to behavioural and emotional 
functioning indicated a worsening in levetiracetam treated patients on aggressive behavior as 
measured in a standardised and systematic way using a validated instrument (CBCL – Achenbach 
Child Behavior Checklist). However, subjects who took levetiracetam in the long-term open label 
follow-up study, did not experience a worsening, on average, in their behavioural and emotional 
functioning; in particular measures of aggressive behavior were not worse than baseline. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting  suspected  adverse  reactions  after  authorisation  of  the  medicinal  product  is  important.  It 
allows  continued  monitoring  of  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  the  medicinal  product.  Healthcare 
professionals  are  asked  to  report  any  suspected  adverse  reactions  via  the  national  reporting  system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Somnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma 
were observed with Matever overdoses.  
Management of overdose 
After an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. 
There is no specific antidote for levetiracetam. Treatment of an overdose will be symptomatic and may 
include haemodialysis. The dialyser extraction efficiency is 60 % for levetiracetam and 74 % for the 
primary metabolite.

5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX14.  
The active substance, levetiracetam, is a pyrrolidone derivative (S-enantiomer of α-ethyl-2-oxo-1-
pyrrolidine acetamide), chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic active substances.  
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of levetiracetam still remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro and in vivo 
experiments suggest that levetiracetam does not alter basic cell characteristics and normal 
neurotransmission.  
In vitro studies show that levetiracetam affects intraneuronal Ca2+ levels by partial inhibition of N-type 
Ca2+ currents and by reducing the release of Ca2+ from intraneuronal stores. In addition it partially 
reverses the reductions in GABA- and glycine-gated currents induced by zinc and β-carbolines. 
Furthermore, levetiracetam has been shown in in vitro studies to bind to a specific site in rodent brain 
tissue. This binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, believed to be involved in vesicle fusion 
and neurotransmitter exocytosis. Levetiracetam and related analogs show a rank order of affinity for 
binding to the synaptic vesicle protein 2A which correlates with the potency of their anti-seizure 
protection in the mouse audiogenic model of epilepsy. This finding suggests that the interaction 
between levetiracetam and the synaptic vesicle protein 2A seems to contribute to the antiepileptic 
mechanism of action of the medicinal product.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Levetiracetam induces seizure protection in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary 
generalised seizures without having a pro-convulsant effect. The primary metabolite is inactive.  
In man, an activity in both partial and generalised epilepsy conditions (epileptiform 
discharge/photoparoxysmal response) has confirmed the broad spectrum pharmacological profile of 
levetiracetam.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation 
in adults, adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy: 
In adults, levetiracetam efficacy has been demonstrated in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies 
at 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day, given in 2 divided doses, with a treatment duration of up to 
18 weeks. In a pooled analysis, the percentage of patients who achieved 50 % or greater reduction 
from baseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week at stable dose (12/14 weeks) was of 
27.7 %, 31.6 % and 41.3 % for patients on 1000, 2000 or 3000 mg levetiracetam respectively and of 
12.6 % for patients on placebo.  
Paediatric population 
In paediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age), levetiracetam efficacy was established in a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study, which included 198 patients and had a treatment duration of 14 weeks. In 
this study, the patients received levetiracetam as a fixed dose of 60 mg/kg/day (with twice a day 
dosing).  
44.6 % of the levetiracetam treated patients and 19.6 % of the patients on placebo had a 50 % or 
greater reduction from baseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week. With continued long-
term treatment, 11.4 % of the patients were seizure-free for at least 6 months and 7.2 % were seizure-
free for at least 1 year.  
In paediatric patients (1 month to less than 4 years of age), levetiracetam efficacy was established in a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study, which included 116 patients and had a treatment duration of 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 days. In this study, patients were prescribed 20 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg daily dose 
of oral solution based on their age titration schedule. A dose of 20 mg/kg/day titrating to 40 mg/kg/day 
for infants one month to less than six months and a dose of 25 mg/kg/day titrating to 50 mg/kg/day for 
infants and children 6 months to less than 4 years old, was use in this study. The total daily dose was 
administered twice daily. 
The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50 % 
reduction from baseline in average daily partial onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central 
reader using a 48-hour video EEG.  The efficacy analysis consisted of 109 patients who had at least 24 
hours of video EEG in both baseline and evaluation periods. 43.6 % of the levetiracetam treated 
patients and 19.6 % of the patients on placebo were considered as responders. The results are 
consistent across age group. With continued long-term treatment, 8.6 % of the patients were seizure-
free for at least 6 months and 7.8 % were seizure-free for at least 1 year.35 infants aged less than 1 
year with partial onset seizures have been exposed in placebo-control clinical studies of which only 13 
were aged < 6 months. 
Monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in 
patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.  
Efficacy of levetiracetam as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, non-
inferiority comparison to carbamazepine-controlled release (CR) in 576 patients 16 years of age or 
older with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy. The patients had to present with unprovoked partial 
seizures or with generalized tonic-clonic seizures only. The patients were randomized to 
carbamazepine CR 400 -1200 mg/day or levetiracetam 1000 -3000 mg/day, the duration of the 
treatment was up to 121 weeks depending on the response.  
Six-month seizure freedom was achieved in 73.0 % of levetiracetam-treated patients and 72.8 % of 
carbamazepine-CR treated patients; the adjusted absolute difference between treatments was 0.2 % 
(95 % CI: -7.8 8.2). More than half of the subjects remained seizure free for 12 months (56.6 % and 
58.5 % of subjects on levetiracetam and on carbamazepine CR respectively).  
In a study reflecting clinical practice, the concomitant antiepileptic medication could be withdrawn in 
a limited number of patients who responded to levetiracetam adjunctive therapy (36 adult patients out 
of 69).  
Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of 
age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. 
Levetiracetam efficacy was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 16 weeks 
duration, in patients 12 years of age and older suffering from idiopathic generalized epilepsy with 
myoclonic seizures in different syndromes. The majority of patients presented with juvenile myoclonic 
epilepsy.  
In this study, levetiracetam, dose was 3000 mg/day given in 2 divided doses.  
58.3 % of the levetiracetam treated patients and 23.3 % of the patients on placebo had at least a 50 % 
reduction in myoclonic seizure days per week. With continued long-term treatment, 28.6 % of the 
patients were free of myoclonic seizures for at least 6 months and 21.0 % were free of myoclonic 
seizures for at least 1 year.  
Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. 
Levetiracetam efficacy was established in a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study which 
included adults, adolescents and a limited number of children suffering from idiopathic generalized 
epilepsy with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in different syndromes (juvenile 
myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand 
Mal seizures on awakening). In this study, levetiracetam dose was 3000 mg/day for adults and 
adolescents or 60 mg/kg/day for children, given in 2 divided doses.  
72.2 % of the levetiracetam treated patients and 45.2 % of the patients on placebo had a 50 % or 
greater decrease in the frequency of PGTC seizures per week. With continued long-term treatment, 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
47.4 % of the patients were free of tonic-clonic seizures for at least 6 months and 31.5 % were free of 
tonic-clonic seizures for at least 1 year. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Levetiracetam is a highly soluble and permeable compound. The pharmacokinetic profile is linear with 
low intra- and inter-subject variability. There is no modification of the clearance after repeated 
administration. There is no evidence for any relevant gender, race or circadian variability. The 
pharmacokinetic profile is comparable in healthy volunteers and in patients with epilepsy. 
Due to its complete and linear absorption, plasma levels can be predicted from the oral dose of 
levetiracetam expressed as mg/kg bodyweight. Therefore, there is no need for plasma level monitoring 
of levetiracetam.  
A significant correlation between saliva and plasma concentrations has been shown in adults and 
children (ratio of saliva/plasma concentrations ranged from 1 to 1.7 for oral tablet formulation and 
after 4 hours post-dose for oral solution formulation). 
Adults and adolescents 
Absorption 
Levetiracetam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Oral absolute bioavailability is close to 
100 %.  
Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are achieved at 1.3 hours after dosing. Steady-state is achieved after 
two days of a twice daily administration schedule.  
Peak concentrations (Cmax) are typically 31 and 43 µg/ml following a single 1 000 mg dose and 
repeated 1 000 mg twice daily dose, respectively.  
The extent of absorption is dose-independent and is not altered by food.  
Distribution 
No tissue distribution data are available in humans.  
Neither levetiracetam nor its primary metabolite are significantly bound to plasma proteins (< 10 %).  
The volume of distribution of levetiracetam is approximately 0.5 to 0.7 l/kg, a value close to the total 
body water volume.  
Biotransformation 
Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolised in humans. The major metabolic pathway (24 % of the 
dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. Production of the primary metabolite, 
ucb L057, is not supported by liver cytochrome P450 isoforms. Hydrolysis of the acetamide group was 
measurable in a large number of tissues including blood cells. The metabolite ucb L057 is 
pharmacologically inactive.  
Two minor metabolites were also identified. One was obtained by hydroxylation of the pyrrolidone 
ring (1.6 % of the dose) and the other one by opening of the pyrrolidone ring (0.9 % of the dose).  
Other unidentified components accounted only for 0.6 % of the dose.  
No enantiomeric interconversion was evidenced in vivo for either levetiracetam or its primary 
metabolite.  
In vitro, levetiracetam and its primary metabolite have been shown not to inhibit the major human 
liver cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP3A4, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 1A2), glucuronyl 
transferase (UGT1A1 and UGT1A6) and epoxide hydroxylase activities. In addition, levetiracetam 
does not affect the in vitro glucuronidation of valproic acid.  
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In human hepatocytes in culture, levetiracetam had little or no effect on CYP1A2, SULT1E1 or 
UGT1A1. Levetiracetam caused mild induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. The in vitro data and in 
vivo interaction data on oral contraceptives, digoxin and warfarin indicate that no significant enzyme 
induction is expected in vivo. Therefore, the interaction of Matever with other substances, or vice 
versa, is unlikely.  
Elimination 
The plasma half-life in adults was 71 hours and did not vary either with dose, route of administration 
or repeated administration. The mean total body clearance was 0.96 ml/min/kg.  
The major route of excretion was via urine, accounting for a mean 95 % of the dose (approximately 
93 % of the dose was excreted within 48 hours). Excretion via faeces accounted for only 0.3 % of the 
dose.  
The cumulative urinary excretion of levetiracetam and its primary metabolite accounted for 66 % and 
24 % of the dose, respectively during the first 48 hours.  
The renal clearance of levetiracetam and ucb L057 is 0.6 and 4.2 ml/min/kg respectively indicating 
that levetiracetam is excreted by glomerular filtration with subsequent tubular reabsorption and that 
the primary metabolite is also excreted by active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration. 
Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance.  
Elderly 
In the elderly, the half-life is increased by about 40 % (10 to 11 hours). This is related to the decrease 
in renal function in this population (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The apparent body clearance of both levetiracetam and of its primary metabolite is correlated to the 
creatinine clearance. It is therefore recommended to adjust the maintenance daily dose of Matever, 
based on creatinine clearance in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).   
In anuric end-stage renal disease adult subjects the half-life was approximately 25 and 3.1 hours 
during interdialytic and intradialytic periods, respectively.  
The fractional removal of levetiracetam was 51 % during a typical 4-hour dialysis session.  
Hepatic impairment 
In subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, there was no relevant modification of the 
clearance of levetiracetam. In most subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the clearance of 
levetiracetam was reduced by more than 50 % due to a concomitant renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
Children (4 to 12 years) 
Following single oral dose administration (20 mg/kg) to epileptic children (6 to 12 years), the half-life 
of levetiracetam was 6.0 hours. The apparent body weight adjusted clearance was approximately 30 % 
higher than in epileptic adults. 
Following repeated oral dose administration (20 to 60 mg/kg/day) to epileptic children (4 to 12 years), 
levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed. Peak plasma concentration was observed 0.5 to 1.0 hour after 
dosing. Linear and dose proportional increases were observed for peak plasma concentrations and area 
under the curve. The elimination half-life was approximately 5 hours. The apparent body clearance 
was 1.1 ml/min/kg. 
Infants and children (1 month to 4 years) 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following single dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 100 mg/ml oral solution to epileptic children 
(1 month to 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed and peak plasma concentrations were 
observed approximately 1 hour after dosing.  The pharmacokinetic results indicated that half-life was 
shorter (5.3 h) than for adults (7.2 h) and apparent clearance was faster (1.5 ml/min/kg) than for adults 
(0.96 ml/min/kg). 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis conducted in patients from 1 month to 16 years of age, 
body weight was significantly correlated to apparent clearance (clearance increased with an increase in 
body weight) and apparent volume of distribution. Age also had an influence on both parameters. This 
effect was pronounced for the younger infants, and subsided as age increased, to become negligible 
around 4 years of age. 
In both population pharmacokinetic analyses, there was about a 20 % increase of apparent clearance of 
levetiracetam when it was co-administered with an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medicinal product. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.  
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in the rat and to a lesser extent in the 
mouse at exposure levels similar to human exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use 
were liver changes, indicating an adaptive response such as increased weight and centrilobular 
hypertrophy, fatty infiltration and increased liver enzymes in plasma.  
No adverse reactions on male or female fertility or reproduction performance were observed in rats at 
doses up to 1800 mg/kg/day (x 6 the MRHD on a mg/m2 or exposure basis) in parents and F1 
generation. 
Two embryo-fetal development (EFD) studies were performed in rats at 400, 1200 and 
3600 mg/kg/day. At 3600 mg/kg/day, in only one of the 2 EFD studies, there was a slight decrease in 
fetal weight associated with a marginal increase in skeletal variations/minor anomalies. There was no 
effect on embryomortality and no increased incidence of malformations. The NOAEL (No Observed 
Adverse Effect Level) was 3600 mg/kg/day for pregnant female rats (x 12 the MRHD on a mg/m2 
basis) and 1200 mg/kg/day for fetuses.  
Four embryo-fetal development studies were performed in rabbits covering doses of 200, 600, 800, 
1200 and 1800 mg/kg/day. The dose level of 1800 mg/kg/day induced a marked maternal toxicity and 
a decrease in fetal weight associated with increased incidence of fetuses with cardiovascular/skeletal 
anomalies. The NOAEL was < 200 mg/kg/day for the dams and 200 mg/kg/day for the fetuses (equal 
to the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).  
A peri- and post-natal development study was performed in rats with levetiracetam doses of 70, 350 
and 1800 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was ≥ 1800 mg/kg/day for the F0 females, and for the survival, 
growth and development of the F1 offspring up to weaning (x 6 the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 
Neonatal  and  juvenile  animal  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  demonstrated  that  there  were  no  adverse 
reactions  seen  in  any  of  the  standard  developmental  or  maturation  endpoints  at  doses  up  to 
1800 mg/kg/day (x 6 – 17 the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). 
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
The use of Matever in accordance with the product information is not likely to result in an 
unacceptable environmental impact (see section 6.6).

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Matever therapy can be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration. 
Conversion to or from oral to intravenous administration can be done directly without titration. The 
total daily dose and frequency of administration should be maintained. 
Partial onset seizures 
The recommended dosing for monotherapy (from 16 years of age) and adjunctive therapy is the same; 
as outlined below. 
All indications 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more 
The initial therapeutic dose is 500 mg twice daily. This dose can be started on the first day of 
treatment. However, a lower initial dose of 250 mg twice daily may be given based on physician 
assessment  of seizure reduction versus potential side effects. This can be increased to 500 mg twice 
daily after two weeks. 
 Depending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the daily dose can be increased up to 1 500 mg 
twice daily. Dose changes can be made in 250 mg or 500 mg twice daily increases or decreases every 
two to four weeks. 
Adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing below 50 kg and children from 4 years of age 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form, presentation and strength 
according to weight, age and dose. Refer to Paediatric population section for dosing adjustments 
based on weight. 
Duration of treatment 
There is no experience with administration of intravenous levetiracetam for longer period than 4 days. 
Discontinuation 
If levetiracetam has to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually (e.g. in adults and 
adolescents weighing more than 50 kg: 500 mg decreases twice daily every two to four weeks; in 
children and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg: dose decrease should not exceed 10 mg/kg twice 
daily every two weeks). 
Special populations 
Elderly (65 years and older) 
Adjustment of the dose is recommended in elderly patients with compromised renal function (see 
“Renal impairment” below). 
Renal impairment 
The daily dose must be individualised according to renal function.  
For adult patients, refer to the following table and adjust the dose as indicated. To use this dosing 
table, an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in ml/min is needed. The CLcr in ml/min 
may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dl) determination, for adults and adolescents weighing 50 
kg or more, the following formula: 
CLcr (ml/min)=   -----------------------------------------  (x 0.85 for women) 
[140-age (years)] x weight (kg) 
72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl) 
Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows: 
CLcr (ml/min/1.73 m2) =    ----------------------------  x 1.73  
BSA subject (m2) 
CLcr (ml/min)

function:

End-stage renal disease patients

(1) A 750 mg loading dose is recommended on the first day of treatment with levetiracetam. 
(2) Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended. 
500 to 1 500 mg twice daily 
500 to 1 000  mg twice daily 
250 to 750 mg twice daily 
250 to 500 mg twice daily 
500 to 1 000 mg once daily (2) 
For children with renal impairment, levetiracetam dose needs to be adjusted based on the renal 
function as levetiracetam clearance is related to renal function. This recommendation is based on a 
study in adult renally impaired patients. 
The CLcr in ml/min/1.73 m2 may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dl) determination, for young 
adolescents and children using the following formula (Schwartz formula):  
  Height (cm) x ks 
CLcr (ml/min/1.73 m2) =  ------------------------------------

(2) Following dialysis, a 5 to 10 mg/kg (0.05 to 0.10 ml/kg) supplemental dose is recommended. 
Hepatic impairment  
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with 
severe hepatic impairment, the creatinine clearance may underestimate the renal insufficiency. 
Therefore a 50 % reduction of the daily maintenance dose is recommended when the creatinine 
clearance is < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
Paediatric population 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form, presentation and strength 
according to age, weight and dose. 
Monotherapy 
The safety and efficacy of Matever in children and adolescents below 16 years as monotherapy 
treatment have not been established. 
No data are available.

Add-on therapy for infants and children less than 4 years  
The safety and efficacy of Matever concentrate for solution for infusion in infants and children less 
than 4 years have not been established. 
Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Matever concentrate is for intravenous use only and the recommended dose must be diluted in at least 
100 ml of a compatible diluent and administered intravenously as a 15-minute intravenous infusion 
(see section 6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Renal impairment 
The administration of levetiracetam to patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustment. In 
patients with severely impaired hepatic function, assessment of renal function is recommended before 
dose selection (see section 4.2). 
Acute kidney injury 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The use of levetiracetam has been very rarely associated with acute kidney injury, with a time to onset 
ranging from a few days to several months. 
Blood cell counts 
Rare cases of decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, 
thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia) have been described in association with levetiracetam 
administration, generally at the beginning of the treatment. Complete blood cell counts are advised in 
patients experiencing important weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections or coagulation disorders 
(section 4.8). 
Suicide 
Suicide, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with 
anti-epileptic agents (including levetiracetam). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled 
trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has shown a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and 
behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known.  
Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation and behaviours 
and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised 
to seek medical advice should signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. 
Abnormal and aggressive behaviours 
Levetiracetam may cause psychotic symptoms and behavioural abnormalities including irritability and 
aggressiveness. Patients treated with levetiracetam should be monitored for developing psychiatric 
signs suggesting important mood and/or personality changes. If such behaviours are noticed, treatment 
adaptation or gradual discontinuation should be considered. If discontinuation is considered, please 
refer to section 4.2. 
Worsening of seizures 
As with other types of antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam may rarely exacerbate seizure frequency or 
severity. This paradoxical effect was mostly reported within the first month after levetiracetam 
initiation or increase of the dose, and was reversible upon drug discontinuation or dose decrease. 
Patients should be advised to consult their physician immediately in case of aggravation of epilepsy.  
Lack of efficacy or seizure worsening has for example been reported in patients with  epilepsy 
associated with sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 8 (SCN8A) mutations. 
Electrocardiogram QT interval prolongation 
Rare cases of ECG QT interval prolongation have been observed during the post-marketing 
surveillance. Levetiracetam should be used with caution in patients with QTc-interval prolongation, in 
patients concomitantly treated with drugs affecting the QTc-interval, or in patients with relevant pre-
existing cardiac disease or electrolyte disturbances. 
Paediatric population 
Available data in children did not suggest impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects 
on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children 
remain unknown. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 57.21 mg sodium per maximum single dose, equivalent to 2.86 % of 
the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Antiepileptic medicinal products 
Pre-marketing data from clinical studies conducted in adults indicate that levetiracetam did not 
influence the serum concentrations of existing antiepileptic medicinal products (phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, gabapentin and primidone) and that these 
antiepileptic medicinal products did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. 
As in adults, there is no evidence of clinically significant medicinal product interactions in paediatric 
patients receiving up to 60 mg/kg/day levetiracetam. 
A retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic interactions in children and adolescents with  epilepsy 
(4 to 17 years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy with orally administered levetiracetam did not 
influence the steady-state serum concentrations of concomitantly administered carbamazepine and 
valproate. However, data suggested a 20 % higher levetiracetam clearance in children taking enzyme-
inducing antiepileptic medicinal products. Dose adjustment is not required.  
Probenecid 
Probenecid (500 mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to 
inhibit the renal clearance of the primary metabolite, but not of levetiracetam. Nevertheless, the 
concentration of this metabolite remains low.  
Methotrexate 
Concomitant administration of levetiracetam and methotrexate has been reported to decrease 
methotrexate clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood methotrexate concentration to 
potentially toxic levels. Blood methotrexate and levetiracetam levels should be carefully monitored in 
patients treated concomitantly with the two medicinal products. 
Oral contraceptives and other pharmacokinetics interactions 
Levetiracetam 1 000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinyl-
estradiol and levonorgestrel); endocrine parameters (luteinizing hormone and progesterone) were not 
modified. Levetiracetam 2 000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of digoxin and 
warfarin; prothrombin times were not modified. Co-administration with digoxin, oral contraceptives 
and warfarin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. 
Alcohol 
No data on the interaction of levetiracetam with alcohol are available. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Specialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. Treatment with 
levetiracetam should be reviewed when a woman is planning to become pregnant. As with all 
antiepileptic medicinal products, sudden discontinuation of levetiracetam should be avoided as this 
may lead to breakthrough seizures that could have serious consequences for the woman and the 
unborn child. Monotherapy should be preferred whenever possible because therapy with multiple 
antiepileptic medicinal products AEDs could be associated with a higher risk of congenital 
malformations than monotherapy, depending on the associated antiepileptics. 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of post-marketing data on pregnant women exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy 
(more than 1 800, among which in more than 1 500 exposure occurred during the 1st trimester) do not 
suggest an increase in the risk for major congenital malformations. Only limited evidence is available 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on the neurodevelopment of children exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy in utero. However, 
current epidemiological studies (on about 100 children) do not suggest an increased risk of 
neurodevelopmental disorders or delays.  
Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, if after careful assessment it is considered clinically 
needed. In such case, the lowest effective dose is recommended. 
Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. Decrease in 
levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more 
pronounced during the third trimester (up to 60% of baseline concentration before pregnancy). 
Appropriate clinical management of pregnant women treated with levetiracetam should be ensured.  
Breast-feeding 
Levetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended.  
However, if levetiracetam treatment is needed during breast-feeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment 
should be weighed considering the importance of breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, 
potential risk for human is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Levetiracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Due to 
possible different individual sensitivity, some patients might experience somnolence or other central 
nervous system related symptoms, especially at the beginning of treatment or following a dose 
increase. Therefore, caution is recommended in those patients when performing skilled tasks, e.g. 
driving vehicles or operating machinery. Patients are advised not to drive or use machines until it is 
established that their ability to perform such activities is not affected. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis, somnolence, headache, fatigue 
and dizziness. The adverse reaction profile presented below is based on the analysis of pooled 
placebo-controlled clinical trials with all indications studied, with a total of 3 416 patients treated with 
levetiracetam. These data are supplemented with the use of levetiracetam in corresponding open-label 
extension studies, as well as post-marketing experience.  The safety profile of levetiracetam is 
generally similar across age groups (adult and paediatric patients) and across the approved epilepsy 
indications.  Since there was limited exposure for levetiracetam intravenous use and since oral and 
intravenous formulations are bioequivalent, the safety information of levetiracetam intravenous will 
rely on levetiracetam oral use. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies (adults, adolescents, children and infants > 1 month) and 
from post-marketing experience are listed in the following table per System Organ Class and per 
frequency. Adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness and their frequency 
is defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 
<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
The risk of anorexia is higher when levetiracetam is co-administered with topiramate. 
In several cases of alopecia, recovery was observed when levetiracetam was discontinued. 
Bone marrow suppression was identified in some of the cases of pancytopenia. 
Cases  of encephalopathy generally occurred at the beginning of the treatment (few days to a few 
months) and were reversible after treatment discontinuation. 
Paediatric population 
In patients aged 1 month to less than 4 years, a total of 190 patients have been treated with 
levetiracetam in placebo-controlled and open label extension studies.  Sixty of these patients were 
treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies.  In patients aged 4-16 years, a total of 645 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients have been treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled and open label extension studies.  
233 of these patients were treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies. In both these 
paediatric age ranges, these data are supplemented with the post-marketing experience of the use of 
levetiracetam. 
In addition, 101 infants aged less than 12 months have been exposed in a post authorization safety 
study. No new safety concerns for levetiracetam were identified for infants less than 12 months of age 
with epilepsy. 
The adverse reaction profile of levetiracetam is generally similar across age groups and across the 
approved epilepsy indications.  Safety results in paediatric patients in placebo-controlled clinical 
studies were consistent with the safety profile of levetiracetam in adults except for behavioural and 
psychiatric adverse reactions which were more common in children than in adults.  In children and 
adolescents aged 4 to 16 years, vomiting (very common, 11.2%), agitation (common, 3.4%), mood 
swings (common, 2.1%), affect lability (common, 1.7%), aggression (common, 8.2%), abnormal 
behaviour (common, 5.6%), and lethargy (common, 3.9%) were reported more frequently than in other 
age ranges or in the overall safety profile.  In infants and children aged 1 month to less than 4 years, 
irritability (very common, 11.7%) and coordination abnormal (common, 3.3%) were reported more 
frequently than in other age groups or in the overall safety profile.   
A double-blind, placebo-controlled paediatric safety study with a non-inferiority design has assessed 
the cognitive and neuropsychological effects of levetiracetam in children 4 to 16 years of age with 
partial onset seizures. It was concluded that levetiracetam was not different (non inferior) from 
placebo with regard to the change from baseline of the Leiter-R Attention and Memory, Memory 
Screen Composite score in the per-protocol population. Results related to behavioural and emotional 
functioning indicated a worsening in levetiracetam treated patients on aggressive behavior as 
measured in a standardized and systematic way using a validated instrument (CBCL – Achenbach 
Child Behavior Checklist). However subjects, who took levetiracetam in the long-term open label 
follow-up study, did not experience a worsening, on average, in their behavioural and emotional 
functioning; in particular measures of aggressive behavior were not worse than baseline. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Somnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma 
were observed with Matever overdoses. 
Management of overdose 
There is no specific antidote for levetiracetam. Treatment of an overdose will be symptomatic and may 
include haemodialysis. The dialyser extraction efficiency is 60 % for levetiracetam and 74 % for the 
primary metabolite.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX14. 
The active substance, levetiracetam, is a pyrrolidone derivative (S-enantiomer of -ethyl-2-oxo-1-
pyrrolidine acetamide), chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic active substances. 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of levetiracetam still remains to be fully elucidated.  In vitro and in vivo 
experiments suggest that levetiracetam does not alter basic cell characteristics and normal 
neurotransmission. 
In vitro studies show that levetiracetam affects intraneuronal Ca2+ levels by partial inhibition of N-type 
Ca2+ currents and by reducing the release of Ca2+ from intraneuronal stores.  In addition, it partially 
reverses the reductions in GABA- and glycine-gated currents induced by zinc and β-carbolines.  
Furthermore, levetiracetam has been shown in in vitro studies to bind to a specific site in rodent brain 
tissue. This binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, believed to be involved in vesicle fusion 
and neurotransmitter exocytosis. Levetiracetam and related analogues show a rank order of affinity for 
binding to the synaptic vesicle protein 2A which correlates with the potency of their anti-seizure 
protection in the mouse audiogenic model of epilepsy. This finding suggests that the interaction 
between levetiracetam and the synaptic vesicle protein 2A seems to contribute to the antiepileptic 
mechanism of action of the medicinal product. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Levetiracetam induces seizure protection in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary 
generalised seizures without having a pro-convulsant effect. The primary metabolite is inactive. 
In man, an activity in both partial and generalised epilepsy conditions (epileptiform 
discharge/photoparoxysmal response) has confirmed the broad spectrum pharmacological profile of 
levetiracetam. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation 
in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy: 
In adults, levetiracetam efficacy has been demonstrated in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies 
at 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day, given in 2 divided doses, with a treatment duration of  up to 
18 weeks. In a pooled analysis, the percentage of patients who achieved 50 % or greater reduction 
from baseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week at stable dose (12/14 weeks) was of 
27.7 %, 31.6 % and 41.3 % for patients on 1000, 2000 or 3000 mg levetiracetam respectively and of 
12.6 % for patients on placebo. 
Paediatric population 
In paediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age), levetiracetam efficacy was established in a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study, which included 198 patients and had a treatment duration of 14 weeks. In 
this study, the patients received levetiracetam as a fixed dose of 60 mg/kg/day (with twice a day 
dosing). 
44.6 % of the levetiracetam treated patients and 19.6 % of the patients on placebo had a 50 % or 
greater reduction from baseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week. With continued long-
term treatment, 11.4 % of the patients were seizure-free for at least 6 months and 7.2 % were seizure-
free for at least 1 year. 
35 infants aged less than 1 year with partial onset seizures have been exposed in placebo-control 
clinical studies of which only 13 were aged < 6 months. 
Monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in 
patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.  
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy of levetiracetam as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, non-
inferiority comparison to carbamazepine controlled release (CR) in 576 patients 16 years of age or 
older with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy.  The patients had to present with unprovoked partial 
seizures or with generalized tonic-clonic seizures only. The patients were randomized to 
carbamazepine CR 400 – 1200 mg/day or levetiracetam 1000 – 3000 mg/day, the duration of the 
treatment was up to 121 weeks depending on the response.   
Six-month seizure freedom was achieved in 73.0 % of levetiracetam-treated patients and 72.8 % of 
carbamazepine-CR treated patients; the adjusted absolute difference between treatments was 0.2%  
(95 % CI: -7.8 8.2). More than half of the subjects remained seizure free for 12 months (56.6 % and 
58.5 % of subjects on levetiracetam and on carbamazepine CR respectively). 
In a study reflecting clinical practice, the concomitant antiepileptic medication could be withdrawn in 
a limited number of patients who responded to levetiracetam adjunctive therapy (36 adult patients out 
of 69).  
Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of 
age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. 
Levetiracetam efficacy was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 16 weeks 
duration, in patients 12 years of age and older suffering from idiopathic generalized epilepsy with 
myoclonic seizures in different syndromes. The majority of patients presented with juvenile myoclonic 
epilepsy. 
In this study, levetiracetam, dose was 3000 mg/day given in 2 divided doses.  
58.3 % of the levetiracetam treated patients and 23.3 % of the patients on placebo had at least a 50 % 
reduction in myoclonic seizure days per week. With continued long-term treatment, 28.6 % of the 
patients were free of myoclonic seizures for at least 6 months and 21.0 % were free of myoclonic 
seizures for at least 1 year. 
Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. 
Levetiracetam efficacy was established in a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study which 
included adults, adolescents and a limited number of children suffering from idiopathic generalized 
epilepsy with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in different syndromes (juvenile 
myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand 
Mal seizures on awakening).  In this study, levetiracetam dose was 3000 mg/day for adults and 
adolescents or 60 mg/kg/day for children, given in 2 divided doses. 
72.2 % of the levetiracetam treated patients and 45.2 % of the patients on placebo had a 50 % or 
greater decrease in the frequency of PGTC seizures per week. With continued long-term treatment, 
47.4 % of the patients were free of tonic-clonic seizures for at least 6 months and 31.5 % were free of 
tonic-clonic seizures for at least 1 year. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic profile has been characterized following oral administration. A single dose of 
1500 mg levetiracetam diluted in 100 ml of a compatible diluent and infused intravenously over 
15 minutes is bioequivalent to 1500 mg levetiracetam oral intake, given as three 500 mg tablets. 
The intravenous administration of doses up to 4000 mg diluted in 100 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride 
infused over 15 minutes and doses up to 2500 mg diluted in 100 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride infused 
over 5 minutes was evaluated. The pharmacokinetic and safety profiles did not identify any safety 
concerns. 
Levetiracetam is a highly soluble and permeable compound. The pharmacokinetic profile is linear with 
low intra- and inter-subject variability. There is no modification of the clearance after repeated 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration. The time independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was also confirmed 
following 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with twice daily dosing.  
There is no evidence for any relevant gender, race or circadian variability. The pharmacokinetic 
profile is comparable in healthy volunteers and in patients with epilepsy. 
Adults and adolescents 
Distribution 
Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) observed in 17 subjects following a single intravenous dose of 
1500 mg infused over 15 minutes was 51 ± 19 µg/ml (arithmetic average ± standard deviation). 
No tissue distribution data are available in humans. 
Neither levetiracetam nor its primary metabolite are significantly bound to plasma proteins ( 10 %). 
The volume of distribution of levetiracetam is approximately 0.5 to 0.7 l/kg, a value close to the total 
body water volume. 
Biotransformation 
Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolised in humans. The major metabolic pathway (24 % of the 
dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. Production of the primary metabolite, 
ucb L057, is not supported by liver cytochrome P450 isoforms. Hydrolysis of the acetamide group was 
measurable in a large number of tissues including blood cells. The metabolite ucb L057 is 
pharmacologically inactive. 
Two minor metabolites were also identified. One was obtained by hydroxylation of the pyrrolidone 
ring (1.6 % of the dose) and the other one by opening of the pyrrolidone ring (0.9 % of the dose).  
Other unidentified components accounted only for 0.6 % of the dose. 
No enantiomeric interconversion was evidenced in vivo for either levetiracetam or its primary 
metabolite. 
In vitro, levetiracetam and its primary metabolite have been shown not to inhibit the major human 
liver cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP3A4, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 1A2), glucuronyl 
transferase (UGT1A1 and UGT1A6) and epoxide hydroxylase activities. In addition, levetiracetam 
does not affect the in vitro glucuronidation of valproic acid. 
In human hepatocytes in culture, levetiracetam had little or no effect on CYP1A2, SULT1E1 or 
UGT1A1. Levetiracetam caused mild induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. The in vitro data and  in 
vivo interaction data on oral contraceptives, digoxin and warfarin indicate that no significant enzyme 
induction is expected in vivo. Therefore, the interaction of Matever with other substances, or vice 
versa, is unlikely. 
Elimination 
The plasma half-life in adults was 71 hours and did not vary either with dose, route of administration 
or repeated administration. The mean total body clearance was 0.96 ml/min/kg. 
The major route of excretion was via urine, accounting for a mean 95 % of the dose (approximately 
93 % of the dose was excreted within 48 hours). Excretion via faeces accounted for only 0.3 % of the 
dose. 
The cumulative urinary excretion of levetiracetam and its primary metabolite accounted for 66 % and 
24 % of the dose, respectively during the first 48 hours. 
The renal clearance of levetiracetam and ucb L057 is 0.6 and 4.2 ml/min/kg respectively indicating 
that levetiracetam is excreted by glomerular filtration with subsequent tubular reabsorption and that 
the primary metabolite is also excreted by active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration. 
Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
In the elderly, the half-life is increased by about 40 % (10 to 11 hours). This is related to the decrease 
in renal function in this population (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The apparent body clearance of both levetiracetam and of its primary metabolite is correlated to the 
creatinine clearance. It is therefore recommended to adjust the maintenance daily dose of Matever, 
based on creatinine clearance in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
In anuric end-stage renal disease adult subjects the half-life was approximately 25 and 3.1 hours 
during interdialytic and intradialytic periods, respectively.  
The fractional removal of levetiracetam was 51 % during a typical 4-hour dialysis session. 
Hepatic impairment 
In subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, there was no relevant modification of the 
clearance of levetiracetam. In most subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the clearance of 
levetiracetam was reduced by more than 50 % due to a concomitant renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
Children (4 to 12 years) 
The pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients has not been investigated after intravenous administration. 
However, based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of levetiracetam, the pharmacokinetics in 
adults after intravenous administration and the pharmacokinetics in children after oral administration, 
the exposure (AUC) of levetiracetam is expected to be similar in paediatric patients aged 4 to 12 years 
after intravenous and oral administration. 
Following single oral dose administration (20 mg/kg) to epileptic children (6 to 12 years), the half-life 
of levetiracetam was 6.0 hours. The apparent body weight adjusted clearance was approximately 30 % 
higher than in epileptic adults. 
Following repeated oral dose administration (20 to 60 mg/kg/day) to epileptic children (4 to 12 years), 
levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed. Peak plasma concentration was observed 0.5 to 1.0 hour after 
dosing. Linear and dose proportional increases were observed for peak plasma concentrations and area 
under the curve. The elimination half-life was approximately 5 hours. The apparent body clearance 
was 1.1 ml/min/kg. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.  
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies but seen in the rat and to a lesser extent in the mouse 
at exposure levels similar to human exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were 
liver changes, indicating an adaptive response such as increased weight and centrilobular hypertrophy, 
fatty infiltration and increased liver enzymes in plasma. 
No adverse reactions on male or female fertility or reproduction performance were observed in rats at 
doses up to 1800 mg/kg/day (x 6 the MRHD on a mg/m2 or exposure basis) in parents and F1 
generation. 
Two embryo-fetal development (EFD) studies were performed in rats at 400, 1200 and 
3600 mg/kg/day. At 3600 mg/kg/day, in only one of the 2 EFD studies, there was a slight decrease in 
fetal weight associated with a marginal increase in skeletal variations/minor anomalies. There was no 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effect on embryomortality and no increased incidence of malformations. The NOAEL (No Observed 
Adverse Effect Level) was 3600 mg/kg/day for pregnant female rats (x 12 the MRHD on a mg/m2 
basis) and 1200 mg/kg/day for fetuses.  
Four embryo-fetal development studies were performed in rabbits covering doses of 200, 600, 800, 
1200 and 1800 mg/kg/day. The dose level of 1800 mg/kg/day induced a marked maternal toxicity and 
a decrease in fetal weight associated with increased incidence of fetuses with cardiovascular/skeletal 
anomalies. The NOAEL was <200 mg/kg/day for the dams and 200 mg/kg/day for the fetuses (equal 
to the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).  
A peri- and post-natal development study was performed in rats with levetiracetam doses of 70, 350 
and 1800 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was ≥ 1800 mg/kg/day for the F0 females, and for the survival, 
growth and development of the F1 offspring up to weaning.(x 6 the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). 
Neonatal and juvenile animal studies in rats and dogs demonstrated that there were no adverse 
reactions seen in any of the standard developmental or maturation endpoints at doses up to 
1800 mg/kg/day (x 6-17 the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis)

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Matever is and what it is used for 
Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic medicine (a medicine used to treat seizures in epilepsy). 
Matever is used: 
• 
on its own in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, to 
treat a certain form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition where the patients have repeated fits 
(seizures). Levetiracetam is used for the epilepsy form in which the fits initially affect only one 
side of the brain, but could thereafter extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain (partial 
onset seizure with or without secondary generalisation). Levetiracetam has been given to you by 
your doctor to reduce the number of fits. 
as an add-on to other antiepileptic medicines to treat: 
• 
▪  partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in adults, adolescents, children and infants 
from one month of age 
▪  myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles)  in adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy 
▪  primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in adults 
and adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the type of epilepsy 
that is thought to have a genetic cause). 
2.  What you need to know before you take Matever 
Do not take Matever 
• 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you are allergic to levetiracetam, pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the other ingredients of 
Warnings and precautions   
Talk to your doctor before taking Matever 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you suffer from kidney problems, follow your doctor’s instructions. He/she may decide if 
your dose should be adjusted. 
If you notice any slowdown in the growth or unexpected puberty development of your child, 
please contact your doctor. 
A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics such as Matever have had thoughts 
of harming or killing themselves. If you have any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal 
ideation, please contact your doctor. 
If you have a family or medical history of irregular heart rhythm (visible on an 
electrocardiogram), or if you have a disease and/or take a treatment that make(s) you prone to 
heartbeat irregularities or salt imbalances. 
• 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the following side effects gets serious or lasts longer than 
a few days: 
• 
Abnormal thoughts, feeling irritable or reacting more aggressively than usually or if you or your 
family and friends notice important changes in mood or behaviour. 
Aggravation of epilepsy 
Your seizures may rarely become worse or happen more often, mainly during the first month 
after the start of the treatment or increase of the dose. In a very rare form of early-onset epilepsy 
(epilepsy associated with SCN8A mutations) that causes multiple types of seizures and loss of 
skills you may notice that the seizures remain present or are becoming worse during your 
treatment. 
If you experience any of these new symptoms while taking Matever, see a doctor as soon as possible. 
Children and adolescents 
• 
Matever is not indicated in children and adolescents below 16 years on its own (monotherapy). 
Other medicines and Matever  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Do not take macrogol (a medicine used as laxative) for one hour before and one hour after taking 
levetiracetam as this may results in a loss of its effect. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, only 
if after careful assessment it is considered necessary by your doctor. 
You should not stop your treatment without discussing this with your doctor. 
A risk of birth defects for your unborn child cannot be completely excluded.  
Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
Matever may impair your ability to drive or operate any tools or machinery, as it may make you feel 
sleepy. This is more likely at the beginning of treatment or after an increase in the dose. You should 
not drive or use machines until it is established that your ability to perform such activities is not 
affected. 
Matever 250 mg, 750 mg tablets contain Sunset Yellow FCF (E110)  
Sunset Yellow FCF (E110) colouring agent may cause allergic reactions. 
The other strengths of Matever tablets do not contain this ingredient. 
Matever 1000 mg tablets contain lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
The other strengths of Matever tablets do not contain this ingredient.

3.  How to take Matever  
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Take the number of tablets following your doctor’s instructions. 
Matever must be taken twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the same 
time each day. 
Adjunctive Therapy and monotherapy (from 16 years of age) 
• 
• 
• 
Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more: 
Recommended dose: between 1 000 mg and 3 000 mg each day. 
When you will first start taking Matever, your doctor will prescribe you a lower dose during 2 
weeks before giving you the lowest daily dose. 
Example: if your daily dose is intended to be 1 000 mg, your reduced starting dose is 1 tablet of 
250 mg in the morning and 1 tablet of 250 mg in the evening, and the dose will be gradually 
incremented to reach 1 000 mg daily after 2 weeks. 
Adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or less: 
Your doctor will prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form of Matever according to 
weight and dose.  
Dose in infants (1 month to 23 months) and children (2 to 11 years) weighing less than 50 
kg: 
Your doctor will prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form of Matever according to 
the age, weight and dose. 
Levetiracetam 100 mg/ml oral solution is a formulation more appropriate to infants and children 
under the age of 6 years and to children and adolescents (from 6 to 17 years) weighing less than 
50 kg and when tablets don’t allow accurate dose. 
Method of administration 
Swallow Matever tablets with a sufficient quantity of liquid (e.g. a glass of water). You may take 
Matever with or without food. After oral administration the bitter taste of levetiracetam may be 
experienced. 
Duration of treatment 
• 
Matever is used as a chronic treatment. You should continue Matever treatment for as long as 
your doctor has told you. 
Do not stop your treatment without your doctor’s advice as this could increase your seizures.  
• 
If you take more Matever than you should 
The possible side effects of an overdose of Matever are sleepiness, agitation, aggression, decrease of 
alertness, inhibition of breathing and coma. 
Contact your doctor if you took more tablets than you should. Your doctor will establish the best 
possible treatment of overdose. 
If you forget to take Matever 
Contact your doctor if you have missed one or more doses.  
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.  
If you stop taking Matever 
If stopping treatment Matever should be discontinued gradually to avoid an increase of seizures. 
Should your doctor decide to stop your Matever treatment, he/she will instruct you about the gradual 
withdrawal of Matever.

How to store Matever 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Matever is and what it is used for  
Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic medicine (a medicine used to treat seizures in epilepsy).  
Matever is used: 
•  on its own in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, to 
treat a certain form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition where the patients have repeated fits 
(seizures). Levetiracetam is used for the epilepsy form in which the fits initially affect only 
one side of the brain, but could thereafter extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain 
(partial onset seizure with or without secondary generalisation). Levetiracetam has been given 
to you by your doctor to reduce the number of fits. 
as an add-on to other antiepileptic medicines to treat: 
• 
▪  partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 
4 years of age 
▪  myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles) in adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. 
▪  primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in 
adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the type of 
epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause). 
Matever concentrate is an alternative for patients when administration of the antiepileptic oral 
Matever medicine is temporarily not feasible. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Matever  
Do not use Matever 
• 
if you are allergic to levetiracetam, pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in Section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
74 
 
 
 
 
 
            
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Matever  
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you suffer from kidney problems, follow your doctor's instructions. He/she may decide if  
your dose should be adjusted. 
If you notice any slowdown in the growth or unexpected puberty development of your child, 
please contact your doctor. 
A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics such as Matever have had thoughts 
of harming or killing themselves. If you have any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal 
ideation, please contact your doctor. 
If you have a family or medical history of irregular heart rhythm (visible on an 
electrocardiogram), or if you have a disease and/or take a treatment that make(s) you prone to 
heartbeat irregularities or salt imbalances. 
• 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the following side effects gets serious or lasts longer than 
a few days: 
• 
Abnormal thoughts, feeling irritable or reacting more aggressively than usually or if you or your 
family and friends notice important changes in mood or behaviour. 
Aggravation of epilepsy 
Your seizures may rarely become worse or happen more often, mainly during the first month 
after the start of the treatment or increase of the dose. In a very rare form of early-onset epilepsy 
(epilepsy associated with SCN8A mutations) that causes multiple types of seizures and loss of 
skills you may notice that the seizures remain present or are becoming worse during your 
treatment. 
If you experience any of these new symptoms while taking Matever, see a doctor as soon as possible. 
Children and adolescents 
• 
Matever is not indicated in children and adolescents below 16 years on its own (monotherapy) 
Other medicines and Matever 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Do not take macrogol (a medicine used as laxative) for one hour before and one hour after taking 
levetiracetam as this may results in a reduction of its effect. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, only 
if after careful assessment it is considered necessary by your doctor. 
You should not stop your treatment without discussing this with your doctor. 
A risk of birth defects for your unborn child cannot be completely excluded.  
Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
Matever may impair your ability to drive or operate any tools or machinery, as it may make you feel 
sleepy. This is more likely at the beginning of treatment or after an increase in the dose. You should 
not drive or use machines until it is established that your ability to perform such activities is not 
affected. 
Matever contains sodium  
This medicine contains 57.21 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each maximum 
single dose. This is equivalent to 2.86 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of 
sodium for an adult. 
3.  How Matever is given  
A doctor or a nurse will administer you Matever as an intravenous infusion. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Matever must be administered twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the 
same time each day. 
The intravenous formulation is an alternative to your oral administration. You can switch from the 
film-coated tablets or from the oral solution to the intravenous formulation or reverse directly without 
dose adaptation. Your total daily dose and frequency of administration remain identical. 
Adjunctive therapy and Monotherapy (from 16 years of age). 
Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more: 
Recommended dose: between 1 000 mg and 3 000 mg each day. 
When you will first start taking Matever, your doctor will prescribe you a lower dose during 2 weeks 
before giving you the lowest daily dose. 
Dose in children (4 to 11 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing less than 50 kg: 
Recommended dose: between 20 mg per kg bodyweight and 60 mg per kg bodyweight each day. 
Method and route of administration 
Matever is for intravenous use. The recommended dose must be diluted in at least 100 ml of a 
compatible diluent and infused over 15 minutes.  
For doctors and nurses, more detailed direction for the proper use of Matever is provided in section 
6. 
Duration of treatment 
• 
There is no experience with administration of intravenous levetiracetam for a longer period than 
4 days. 
If you stop using Matever 
If stopping treatment, as with other antiepileptic medicines, Matever should be discontinued gradually 
to avoid an increase of seizures. Should your doctor decide to stop your Matever treatment, he/she will 
instruct you about the gradual withdrawal of Matever. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

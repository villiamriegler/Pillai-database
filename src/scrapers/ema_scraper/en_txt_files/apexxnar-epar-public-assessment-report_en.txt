1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pfizer Europe MA EEIG submitted on 5 February 2021 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Apexxnar, through the centralised 
procedure under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 19 September 2019.  
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
“Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults 18 years of age and older. 
See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for information on protection against specific pneumococcal serotypes. 
The use of TRADENAME should be determined on the basis of official recommendations taking into 
consideration the risk of invasive disease and pneumonia in different age groups, underlying 
comorbidities, as well as the variability of serotype epidemiology in different geographical areas.” 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0159/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0159/2020 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for 
a condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.4.2.  Derogation(s) from market exclusivity 
Not applicable 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 7/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.5.  Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
1.5.1.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004. 
1.5.2.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance ‘pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes 8, 10A, 11A, 
12F, 15B, 22F and 33F conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein’ contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union which was 
initially agreed. 
However, based on the recent positive CHMP opinion (14.10.2021) for pneumococcal vaccine 
[Vaxneuvance (15-valent, adsorbed)], which contains serotypes 22F and 33F conjugated to 
CRM197, the applicant was requested to revise the NAS claim, which was done accordingly.  
The  CHMP  now  considers  that  pneumococcal  polysaccharide  serotypes  8,  10A,  11A,  12F  and  15B 
conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein can be qualified as new active substances.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
20-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) is a protein conjugated 
polysaccharide vaccine intended for active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and 
pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults ≥ 18 years of age. 
Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) can occur when S. pneumoniae gains access to the blood or 
otherwise normally sterile sites. Depending on the site where invasion occurs, this can lead to 
different disease manifestations (e.g. meningitis, bacteraemia, sepsis, bacteraemic pneumonia, and 
septic arthritis). 
S. pneumoniae is the leading bacterial pathogen that causes community-acquired pneumonia 
(CAP). CAP is amongst the most common causes of acute infection that require hospital 
administration.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be a major cause of vaccine-preventable disease 
worldwide, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. Older adults (≥65 years of age), 
adults ≥18 years of age with certain comorbid conditions (e.g. chronic lung disease, chronic liver 
disease, chronic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, asthma), and immunocompromised adults (e.g. 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) patients) 
are particularly susceptible to pneumococcal disease. 
Studies from Europe have reported a high proportion of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
due to S. pneumoniae in hospitalised adults. In a recent population-based cohort study from the 
UK, 36.6% of CAP cases in adults ≥16 years of age were caused by S. pneumoniae. Similar 
proportions were also found in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, and Sweden and by a meta-
analysis of 35 pneumonia studies in adults predominantly conducted in developed countries. Non-
bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia is much more common than bacteraemic pneumococcal 
pneumonia. For example, 89.7% and 82.3% of adult cases of pneumococcal CAP large pneumonia 
surveillance studies in the UK (2013–2018) and Spain (2011–2014) were non-invasive. 
Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence rates in adults for surveillance years between 
2013 and 2019 have been reported for several European countries. The annual incidence per 
100,000 population in adults ≥65 years of age was between 22.2 and 51.0 with 30-day case 
fatality rates for IPD varying between 11% and 30% based on several publications in European 
countries. According to the ECDC a total of 24,663 IPD cases were reported in the EU/EEA in 2018 
(6.4 cases/ 100,000 population). IPD rates were highest at the extremes of age (infants ≤1 yoa: 
14.4 cases/ 100,000 population; adults ≥65 yoa: 18.7/ 100,000 population).  The case-fatality rate 
of IPD has not decreased over the past two decades. 
Burden of the seven additional non-13vPnC serotypes covered by 20vPnC 
According to the ECDC the 10 most common serotypes (≥70% of isolates) causing IPD in Europe in 
2018 were in order of decreasing frequency: 8, 3, 19A, 22F, 12F, 9N, 15A, 10A, 23B and 6C. In 
adults ≥65 yoa 73% of cases were caused by serotypes targeted by PPSV23 and 29% by serotypes 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 10/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
targeted by 13vPnC (source: Invasive pneumococcal disease - Annual Epidemiological Report for 
2018; 8 Sep 2020). Notably, despite being targeted by 13vPnC and PPSV23, serotypes 3 and 19A 
remain amongst the most frequent IPD causing serotypes in Europe in adults ≥ 65 yoa (14.7% and 
7.6%, respectively).  The seven additional serotypes covered by 20vPnC but not by 13vPnC (8, 
10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F) are responsible for a substantial proportion of the remaining 
IPD disease burden In the EU, serotype 8 is of particular concern, causing 14% of all IPD cases in 
older adults in 2018, followed by 22F (7.4%), 12F (4.0%), 11A (2.8%), 33F (2.5%) and 10A 
(2.3%). Overall, the serotypes included in 20vPnC represent seven of the 10 most prevalent 
serotypes that caused IPD in adults ≥65 years of age. 
In addition, these serotypes have characteristics that make them medically important, including 
antibiotic resistance (11A, 15B), association with outbreaks (8, 12F), and a tendency to cause 
more severe disease (e.g. association with meningitis and/or increased mortality rate) (10A, 11A, 
22F). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae commonly asymptomatically colonises the 
human nasopharynx. Carriage rates decline with age (approx. 1/3rd to 2/3rds of children and 
≤10% of adults are colonised). Transmission occurs mainly via nasal shedding (mucus droplets). 
Pneumococcal spread to more distal sites (e.g. middle ear, the lung, bloodstream or brain) can 
cause a range of disease manifestations (see clinical presentation below). This process depends on 
complex host-pathogen interactions, involving a multitude of bacterial virulence factors and 
inflammatory host cascades. The capsule consists of layers of polysaccharides, is the major surface 
antigen and exists in approx. 100 different chemical compositions called serotypes. It is a 
prerequisite for virulence (non-encapsulated strains exist but show reduced virulence or are 
avirulent), prevents mucus entrapment of S. pneumoniae and counteracts opsonophagocytosis. 
Generation of anti-capsular antibodies which enhance opsonophagocytosis forms the basis of 
currently approved pneumococcal vaccines. Conferred protection is serotype-specific, no serotype-
independent pneumococcal vaccines are available. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Pneumococcal disease mainly presents as non-invasive disease, such as non-bacteraemic 
pneumonia, sinusitis or acute otitis media (the latter most commonly in young children). The 
comparably less frequent albeit generally more severe invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) occurs 
when S. pneumoniae gains access to more distal, normally sterile anatomical sites. IPD presents as 
meningitis, bacteraemic pneumonia, bacteraemia without focus and septic arthritis. 
Regardless of the presence of bacteraemia, pneumococcal pneumonia is associated with 
complications and long-term sequelae in all age groups, including respiratory failure requiring 
hospitalisation, empyema, and necrotizing pneumonia, exacerbations of chronic medical conditions, 
declines in quality of life, and with a significant increased risk of death within 30 days (acute) and 1 
year (long-term) after the event. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Disease Treatment 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 11/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
S. pneumoniae infections are treated based on clinical presentation and susceptibility data to 
antimicrobials. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are the most commonly used antimicrobials against S. 
pneumoniae. Although S. pneumoniae is considered as a “classical” multi-resistant pathogen, 
increasing resistance rates have been reported which may lead to treatment failures. 
Disease Prevention 
At time of Marketing Authorisation Application, three pneumococcal vaccines were licensed in the 
EU: 
- 
The unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine PPSV23 (Pneumovax23) was initially 
authorised via national procedures in EU member states in the 1980s. PPSV23 contains 
capsular polysaccharides for 23 different serotypes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 
11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F). It is indicated for use in 
persons 2 years of age and older for whom there is an increased risk of morbidity and 
mortality from pneumococcal disease due to aging and/or underlying medical conditions. 
- 
The initial pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 7vPnC (Prevenar), was licensed in 2000 for 
use in children, but is no longer authorised in the EU. 13vPnC (Prevenar 13) was 
subsequently developed to expand disease coverage in children (first licensed in 2010) and 
to better address disease in adults (first licensed in 2011). It targets serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 
6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F. 
Efficacy against IPD and pneumonia was demonstrated in a randomised clinical trial in 
adults ≥65 years of age. Since its introduction, 13vPnC has demonstrated real-world 
effectiveness against pneumococcal disease in adults 
-Synflorix was licensed in the EU in 2009 and is indicated for infants and children from 6 
weeks up to 5 years of age. 
During this procedure, Vaxneuvance received a positive CHMP opinion (14 10 2021), with 
Commission Decision (authorisation) adopted on 13.12.2021. This pertains to a 15-valent 
pneumococcal vaccine containing the 13 serotypes included in Prevenar 13 and additionally 
serotypes 22F and 33F. All 15 serotypes are also contained in 20vPnC (Apexxnar). 
2.2.  About the product 
20vPnC is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, modelled after 13vPnC. 20vPnC contains the same 
13 serotype-specific capsular polysaccharide antigens included in the authorised 13vPnC (1, 3, 4, 
5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F), plus 7 additional serotype-specific capsular 
polysaccharides (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F). 
Each antigen is covalently linked (i.e. conjugated) to CRM197. This carrier protein modifies the 
immune response to the polysaccharide from a T cell independent response to a T cell dependent 
response. The T cell dependent response leads to both an enhanced antibody response and 
generation of memory B cells, allowing for an anamnestic (booster) response on re-exposure to the 
bacteria. 20vPnC was developed to further expand protection against the global burden of vaccine-
preventable pneumococcal disease.  
In adults, the levels of circulating antibodies that correlate with protection against pneumococcal 
disease have not been clearly defined. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 12/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
20vPnC is to be administered as a single dose to adults 18 years of age and older. Based on the 
clinical experience with 13vPnC, if the use of PPSV23 is considered appropriate, 20vPnC should be 
given first. 
The targeted indication for 20vPnC is: Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease 
and pneumonia caused by S pneumoniae in adults ≥18 years of age. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product 
was not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the vaccine technology 
employed from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation not being considered of major interest as it 
is an extension of an existing formulation (13vPnC/ Prevenar 13). Moreover, despite the known 
limitations of an unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine such as PPSV23 and the general advantages 
of a conjugate vaccine, there is a licensed vaccine available largely covering the same serotypes as 
20vPnC. 
2.4.  Quality aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This 20-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine consists of capsular polysaccharide 
antigens of S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 
19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F with each saccharide individually conjugated to diphtheria CRM197 
protein. The conjugates induce serotype-specific responses to the capsular polysaccharides 
contained in the vaccine (and within-serogroup for certain serotypes, e.g. serotype 15C) intended 
to protect against disease due to the vaccine serotypes. 
Other ingredients are succinate buffer containing sodium chloride (NaCl), succinic acid and 
polysorbate 80 in water for injections, at pH 5.8, with aluminium phosphate as an adjuvant. 
The vaccine is a suspension for intramuscular injection available in 0.5 mL single-dose prefilled 
syringes, administered by intramuscular injection. 
The target indication for 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) is active 
immunisation for the prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae 
serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F 
in adults 18 years of age and older.

2.4.2.1.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The applicant has provided the stability data for all 20 MBC and also for the CRM197. An annual 
stability programme is foreseen as well.  
Overall manufacture 
With respect to the manufacturing process, all the individual steps as well as the applicable controls 
were properly described. The polysaccharide production scheme is a four-stage fermentation 
process followed by cellular inactivation plus a harvest step. The four stages of the fermentation 
process are: seed bottles, seed fermentor, intermediate fermentor and production fermentor. After 
fermentation, the polysaccharides are purified. Purified serotypes are shipped with a validated 
shipping process. Upon activation, polysaccharides are conjugated to the CRM. Conjugation occurs 
in aqueous or DMSO conditions.  
With respect to the novel serotypes, all individual steps of the fermentation, purification activation 
and conjugation have also been provided in sufficient detail in the eCTD. Whenever serotype 
specific steps are involved, these were also described and explained. All in-process controls and in-
process monitoring tests were mentioned.  
Conjugation of the novel serotypes is mostly also performed under either DMSO or aqueous 
conditions. Serotype 33F conjugation is performed under specific conditions that are different from 
the other serotypes, but this is also described in sufficient detail in the dossier. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 14/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The production scheme of CRM197 is a four-stage fermentation process plus a harvest step followed 
by ultrafitration, UF concentration and impurity precipitation/ depth filtration in preparation for 
purification. The four stages of the fermentation process are: primary flasks, secondary/aspirator 
flasks, seed fermentor and production fermentor.  
Purification is a four-stage process. The four stages of the purification process are: batch pooling 
and concentration/diafiltration column chromatography purification, concentration/diafiltration, and 
filtration and dispensing. The CRM197 is then frozen and stored -75 ± 5°C.  
In preparation for conjugation of CRM with serotypes 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 19F, 22F 
and 23F activated saccharides are lyophilised in a three-stage process. The 1 L Type 1 glass bottles 
containing lyophilised active substance intermediate are stored at -20 ± 5°C from the date of 
lyophilisation completion. The description of the manufacture of the CRM197 is acceptable.  
Control of materials 
Each manufacturing site has a vendor management programme and appropriate quality systems to 
ensure control of raw materials used for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturing. Raw 
materials are purchased from approved suppliers and tested and released. Non-compendial raw 
materials may be replaced with compendial materials following appropriate qualification of the new 
sources of the raw materials. Water for injection (WFI) manufactured at the facility is used 
throughout the process and meets USP/Ph. Eur. requirements. 
The control of materials has been provided for the 13vPnC serotypes, the novel serotypes and the 
CRM carrier. All information on raw materials has been provided, also for materials of biological 
origin. The applicant has given complete and detailed description on the source, history and 
generation of the cell banks (MCB and WCB) for all the 20 polysaccharides and the CRM carrier.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Controls of critical process steps are employed during manufacture of pneumococcal polysaccharide 
serotypes to ensure product quality is maintained. The process controls include release and 
stability tests and in-process tests with their respective acceptance criteria. If the results of these 
parameters/controls are outside of the acceptable ranges, an evaluation of the deviation is 
performed, and the decision about material disposition for further manufacture is based on the 
investigation conclusion.  
In-process tests and acceptance criteria for pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes are provided. 
All analytical methods for in process testing of pneumococcal polysaccharides were properly 
described in the eCTD. Validation of the methods has been done according to ICH Q2(R1). 
The release and stability specifications for pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes are provided 
and justified.13vPnC serotypes are dispensed and stored in 50 L stainless steel (SS) vessels. 
Pneumococcal polysaccharide for the novel serotypes is stored in 5 L polyethylene (PE) flexible 
containers fitted with ports and tubing to facilitate dispensing into the FCs and subsequent 
dispensing of ASI during active substance manufacturing. 
The data presented provide rationale and justification for the pneumococcal polysaccharides 
commercial shelf life when stored at the recommended temperature of -15 to -25°C. Activated 
saccharides are filled into 1 L Type 1 glass bottles, lyophilised and closed with a grey butyl stopper. 
The stopper is secured with a non-product contact cap. The materials of construction for all 
product-contact components have been demonstrated to be compatible with the activated 
saccharides through stability studies for each serotype.

Process Validation and/or Evaluation 
•  13vPnC serotypes 
As part of the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) preparation for licensure, Pfizer 
did not repeat process validation for the 13 serotypes included in the 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) as the processes have been validated before and product quality is 
monitored by the routine Annual Product Quality Review (APQR) and the Continued Process 
Verification (CPV) programme which verify that the quality attributes are being appropriately 
controlled following process validation. 
The purpose of process validation was to demonstrate that the pneumococcal polysaccharide 
conjugate manufacturing process is under control and produces pneumococcal polysaccharide, 
activated saccharide and monovalent bulk conjugate (MBC) active substance of acceptable quality 
by meeting all the pre-determined acceptance criteria. 
•  Novel serotypes 
Validation of the novel pneumococcal polysaccharide-CRM197 conjugate serotypes manufacturing 
processes has been successfully completed starting from each of 3 independent, consecutive thaws 
of the WCB used in production of pneumococcal polysaccharide active substance intermediate. The 
validation was designed to demonstrate that the manufacturing process, when operating within 
defined process controls, can consistently produce polysaccharide and polysaccharide-CRM197 
conjugate meeting pre-determined acceptance criteria and demonstrate expected, reproducible, 
and consistent process performance. 
•  CRM197 
Validation of the manufacturing process for CRM197 has been successfully completed from each of 
three independent, consecutive thaws of the WCB. The validation was designed to demonstrate 
that the manufacturing process, when operating within defined process controls, would consistently 
produce CRM197 meeting pre-determined acceptance criteria and demonstrate expected, 
reproducible and consistent process performance. 
Manufacturing process development 
For the 13vPnC serotypes the pneumococcal polysaccharide processes used commercially in the 
13vPnC vaccine are the result of process development work and learning from commercial 
experience and the activation and conjugation process used commercially is the result of process 
development work and learning from commercial experience.  
As can be seen in the description of the manufacturing process, the fermentation, activation and 
conjugation for the novel serotypes are similar to what is used for the 13vPnC serotypes while the 
purification process is different.  
The CRM197 processes for all conjugate serotypes are the result of process development work and 
learning from commercial experience  
A comprehensive understanding of the manufacturing processes has been developed through 
commercial-scale runs and process characterisation studies that include design of experiments 
(DOE) and using scale-down models of individual unit operations. No design space is claimed. 
In alignment with ICH Q10, effective quality systems are in place to support continued 
quality/process verification and post-approval change management. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 16/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
A recurring risk review, including a review of the classification of process parameters, takes place 
periodically throughout the lifecycle of the product. Knowledge management supports 
interpretation of all relevant data gathered in support of continuous improvement.  
Characterisation 
The applicant has given detailed information on the characterisation of the pneumococcal 
polysaccharides, the activated pneumococcal polysaccharides and the conjugated polysaccharides. 
2.4.2.2.  Specification 
The specifications of the conjugated serotypes contain the same attributes for the 13vPnC and 
novel serotypes.  
The proposed release and stability tests for the pneumococcal monovalent bulk conjugates are in 
compliance with Ph. Eur. 2150.  
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
A summary of the analytical procedures used for pneumococcal saccharide-CRM197 conjugates is 
provided in the eCTD. Validation or verification of analytical procedures was performed to ensure 
the quality, identity, purity, and safety of monovalent bulk conjugates (MBC). Analytical procedures 
were confirmed suitable for their intended use by assessing all relevant validation elements 
described in ICH Q2(R1), Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology. Compendial 
procedures were verified according to USP <1226> Verification of Compendial Procedures, as well 
as the relevant Ph. Eur. and JP general chapters. 
Non-compendial quantitative analytical procedures were validated for precision, accuracy, 
specificity, linearity and range. Quantitative procedures used to determine the content of minor 
constituents were further validated for limit of quantitation. Compendial procedures were confirmed 
fit for use through method verification.  
Batch analysis and justification of specification 
All batches fulfil the acceptance criteria and show, within each serotype, reproducible results well 
within the limits. 
Container closure 
The monovalent bulk conjugate (MBC) is dispensed and stored in engineered film, 2 L (FCs).  
2.4.2.3.  Stability 
The data presented provide rationale and justification for the novel pneumococcal saccharide-
CRM197 conjugate serotypes , 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 
22F, 23F and 33F commercial shelf lives when stored at the recommended temperature of 2-8 °C. 
The data presented provide rationale and justification for the liquid CRM197 commercial shelf life 
when stored at the recommended temperature of -75±5 °C.

preservative. A 25G x 5/8" (0.5 x 16 mm) needle or 25G x 1″ (0.5 x 25 mm) needle can be 
included in the packaging. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The 20vPnC vaccine contains 20 active substances (monovalent bulk conjugate (MBC) serotypes 1, 
3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F), each 
supplied at a target conjugate concentration of 0.5 g/L saccharide.  
No novel excipients are used and no excipients of human or animal origin and no novel excipients 
are used. 
Each prefilled syringe of 20vPnC vaccine is designed to deliver 2.2 μg of each conjugate serotype 
(except serotype 6B) and 4.4 μg of conjugate serotype 6B in 0.5 mL dose of vaccine. The vaccine 
is formulated in succinate buffer containing sodium chloride (NaCl) and polysorbate 80 (PS80), at 
pH 5.8, and containing aluminium phosphate (AlPO4) aluminium as an adjuvant. Each 1 mL syringe 
contains a 0.5 mL dose of vaccine, supplied as a single-dose injection for parenteral administration, 
with no preservative. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium N.V. Rijksweg 12, Puurs, Belgium is the manufacturer responsible for 
the batch release. 
Manufacturing process controls 
The 20vPnC vaccine formulation contains 20 monovalent bulk conjugates (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 
6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F) in succinate/ sodium 
chloride (NaCl) buffer, pH 5.8, and aluminium phosphate (AlPO4) at 0.25 mg/mL aluminium as 
adjuvant with polysorbate 80.  
These IPCs are identified at the level of the formulation step and during the filling process. No 
reprocessing steps have been identified in the finished product manufacturing process. 
Process validation / verification 
Validation of the 20vPnC vaccine finished product manufacturing process has been successfully 
completed. The validation was designed to demonstrate that the manufacturing process, when 
operating within defined process controls, can consistently produce 20vPnC finished product 
meeting pre-determined acceptance criteria and demonstrate expected, reproducible, and 
consistent process performance. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 18/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
All excipients used for 20vPnC vaccine finished product are compendial except for aluminium 
phosphate suspension (AlPO4). 
The release and stability specification for the compendial and non-compendial excipients have been 
provided. This is deemed acceptable.  
The specifications for the final product have been provided and these have been set in compliance 
with the Ph. Eur. monograph for Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccine (adsorbed) (2150).  
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
Analytical  procedures  were  provided  and  adequately  described.  The  results  generated  for  the 
verification/validation of the analytical procedures were found satisfactory and demonstrate that the 
analytical procedures are suitable for use in release and stability testing (assays for content/potency, 
total and bound antigenicity). 
Batch analysis and justification of specification 
Sufficient  batch  data  have  been  included  for  the  different  batches  used  in  the  manufacturing 
development of the vaccine. Batches have always been tested against the specifications in force at 
time of testing. 
Container closure 
The 20vPnC in a prefilled syringe (PFS) is defined as an integral drug-device combination that is 
governed as a medicinal product under Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, as the device 
component forms an integral product intended exclusively for use in combination with the drug 
product syringe. The PFS is designed and developed in conformance with ISO 13485:2016. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The shelf life claim of 20vPnC finished product is 24 months when stored at the recommended 
temperature of 2-8°C. The shelf life claim is based on 24 months of real time stability data from 4 
primary stability lots of 20vPnC finished product stored at the intended condition of 5±3°C 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Multiple mechanisms and procedures are used to minimize the entry of adventitious agents into the 
process stream. The adventitious agent control programme includes the engineering systems of the 
facility and vessels, the control of the materials used in the process, various filtration steps to 
control microbial load in media, buffers and the process stream, and in-process and environmental 
testing to monitor the level of adventitious agents in and around the process stream. 
20vPnC is composed of components derived from microbial fermentation and is not a viral product. 
Several ingredients of animal origin are used in the preparation of the vaccine component, and the 
main theoretical risk associated with these ingredients is contamination of the product by 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents. To minimize this risk, the applicant has 
been vigilant in assuring proper use and control of animal derived materials by: 
•  Working with suppliers to collect the most up-to-date information on animal derived 
materials used in this process; 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 19/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
•  Working with the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for updates on 
regulations and practices to control TSE in the US; 
•  Working with other agencies worldwide, including the Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (CHMP), when needed, to keep current on any changes in compliance 
expectations. 
Details of the starting material/reagent containing material of animal origin including its source and 
preparation were discussed and considered satisfactory with regard to TSE. These materials are 
commercially available and are not specifically produced for the applicant. Other materials of 
animal origin are used in the production of polymer for the stoppers, filters, manifolds, containers 
and/or filters components. These components may contain traces of animal tallow derivatives. The 
tallow is considered compliant with the TSE note for guidance (EMA/410/01, Note for Guidance on 
Minimizing the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and 
Veterinary Medicinal Products). 
Moreover, equipment and materials are cleaned, sterilised and/or chemically decontaminated 
according to validated procedures, thereby further reducing process risk. 
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
The CMC part, Module3 of the dossier was extensive and of high quality. 
The applicant has provided detailed descriptions of the intermediates (20 pneumococcal 
polysaccharides and carrier protein CRM197) and the 20 active substances (Monovalent bulk 
conjugates). The starting and raw materials have been appropriately described and all process 
steps have been described and have been validated during the process validation and 
development. Specifications have been set for intermediates and individual active substances. 
Analytical methods were described, and validation summaries provided. All acceptance criteria for 
specifications are properly justified for intermediates and active substances. 
Container closure data are provided, and stability programmes are running. The batches used for 
shelf life claim are deemed representative for commercial batches and as such, acceptable for 
setting the shelf life. Depending on the serotype-conjugate, a shelf life from 12 months up to 36 
months for individual AS is accepted. 
Finished product manufacturing process, the control of materials, the process controls and the 
process development were adequately described. FP specifications and justifications were provided 
as well as information on the analytical methods, which were properly validated or qualified. 
Container closure systems for FP were described and are deemed suitable. 
Stability data were provided for clinical and PPQ FP lots. The applicant claims a shelf life of 24 
months when stored at 2-8°C, which can be granted based on the available data. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical toxicity assessment for 20vPnC consisted of 9 Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-
compliant studies, which were conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice for 
Nonclinical Laboratory Studies, in an OECD member state. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 20/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
GLP inspection:  No request for a GLP inspection (routine or triggered) has been made. 
The scope of the non-clinical programme is in line with applicable guidelines for the development of 
a vaccine and is considered adequate. In principle, the vaccine lots used in non-clinical studies 
should be adequately representative of the formulation intended for clinical investigation. Minor 
differences are present in the analytical data for nonclinical toxicity study and clinical study drug 
product lots. However, they are not considered to impact the results of the respective studies.  
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Non-clinical studies were performed in mice, rats and rabbits to demonstrate immunogenicity of 
20vPnC and the monovalent conjugates of the seven new serotypes contained in 20vPnC 
(serotypes 8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F). The responses to each of the seven new antigens 
contained in 20vPnC were evaluated separately as well as in combination. However, according to 
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) the 10 most common serotypes 
accounting for 70% of typed isolates circulating in Europe are: 8, 3, 19A, 22F, 12F, 9N, 15A, 10A, 
23B and 6C (in order of decreasing frequency). Clinical relevance of any cross-functional immune 
responses for the serotypes not included in 20vPnC may be determined in a post-marketing 
setting.  
The pharmacology studies were adequately designed to assess relevant immune parameters, 
including functional immune response leading to protection (i.e. IgG induction and 
opsonophagocytic activity).  
In mice, dose-dependent immune responses to the polysaccharide conjugates for the 7 additional 
serotypes were determined by increases in OPA titres following two SC administrations three weeks 
apart.  
Immunogenicity of each new serotype conjugate was assessed after 2 or 3 SC injections. Even if 
presented results support immunogenicity of the newly added conjugate serotype, there are limits 
in the study because of the route of injection used (SC versus IM), and the number of injections (2 
or 3 versus 1 in clinics).  
In rats, the 7 additional conjugates in 20vPnC were administered as a combined 7-valent vaccine 
once every three weeks for a total of three doses. Humoral and functional immune responses were 
observed as measured by dLIA and OPA. Study VR-VTR-10666 has been conducted in female rats 
only, by the SC route, and with three repeated injections, which does not mimic the foreseen 
clinical schema (1 unique IM injection in adults in the clinic.  
In general, it was demonstrated that the polysaccharide conjugates for the 7 additional serotypes 
included in 20vPnC are immunogenic in mice and rats. 20vPnC was also found to be immunogenic 
in rabbits. 
In rabbits, increases in serotype-specific IgG and OPA responses were observed following two IM 
administrations of 20vPnC three weeks apart. Serum IgG levels increased by at least 2 logs 
compared to baseline. OPA titres increased by at least 27-fold compared to baseline after 
immunisation.  
The serotype 12F capsular polysaccharide structure was found to contain a partial substitution of 
N-acetyl-galactosamine by 4KQ using newer methodology as compared to the current published 
structure. Presence or absence of this substitution in the 12F polysaccharide was not found to 
impact immunogenicity against clinical 12F isolates. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 21/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Standalone safety pharmacology studies were not performed for this submission. This approach is 
acceptable for vaccines and in line with recent guidance. Furthermore, clinical cage-side 
observations in combination with microscopic examination of the nervous system and respiratory 
tract were conducted in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study (12GR385) and led to the conclusion 
that there were no clinical signs indicative of respiratory or neurologic system effects.  
The absence of cardiovascular functional endpoints in the pivotal toxicity study is somewhat 
problematic, since histopathological findings of cardiotoxicity were observed in two animals treated 
with 20vPnC in that study. These findings are discussed in the toxicology section of this report. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted for 20vPnC as according to the relevant EMA and 
WHO Guidelines they are not required for vaccines 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The initial toxicity assessment for 20vPnC consisted of three GLP-compliant studies in NZW rabbits, 
including an initial pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study, a fertility and developmental toxicity study 
and a local tolerance study. Following signs of cardiotoxicity in the pivotal toxicity study, a series of 
investigative studies was conducted 
2.5.4.1.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicity of 20vPnC was evaluated in a pivotal 59-day toxicity study in rabbits when 
administered by IM injection once every 2 weeks for a total of 5 doses followed by a 4-week dose-
free recovery phase. Injection site findings consisting of minimal to moderate chronic-active 
inflammation and degeneration/necrosis of myofibers as well as injection site reactogenicity were 
observed. The severity of these reactions in the 20vPnC-dosed animals was comparable to the 
vehicle group but greater than in rabbits administered saline and was decreased at the end of the 
recovery phase. All injection site findings and reactogenicity were considered non-adverse in this 
study.  
Microscopic findings of mild to moderate multifocal inflammation with degeneration/necrosis of 
cardiomyocytes and minimal increased interstitial fibrosis in the papillary muscle of the left 
ventricle of the heart were observed in one 20vPnC low dose (once the human dose) animal and in 
one 20vPnC high dose (twice the human dose) animal at the end of the dosing phase. At the end of 
the recovery phase, marked multifocal interstitial fibrosis was observed in the interventricular 
septum of one 20vPnC low dose animal. Heart findings were initially attributed to test article 
administration; however, following multiple investigative activities, the heart findings were 
considered not related to the vaccine or its components but likely due to stress associated with 
handling and procedures (see below). 
Based on the non-adverse injection site findings and the follow-up investigations on the 
microscopic heart findings, 2x the clinical dose of 20vPnC (2x 0.5 mL) was considered the NOAEL in 
this study. However, the heart findings require further explanation, as discussed below.  
Investigative repeat-dose toxicity studies 
Additional investigative studies were conducted to understand the potential causative factors in the 
development of the heart findings observed in the pivotal toxicity study.  
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 22/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The weight of evidence from these investigative activities indicates that the heart findings were not 
related to the vaccine conjugates or other vaccine components. This conclusion is based on 
evidence that comparable heart findings can occur independent of test article in rabbits, heart 
findings were not due to direct or immune-mediated cardiotoxicity, and comparable findings may 
be induced in rabbits with increased handling and study procedures, suggesting the potential 
contribution of factors extrinsic to test article, such as stress, in the development of heart findings. 
These conclusions were supported by an external pathology working group comprised of 3 
independent, ACVP board-certified veterinary pathologists who performed a blinded review and 
evaluation of all heart slides from animals diagnosed with inflammation with degeneration/necrosis 
of cardiac myocytes along with slides without this finding from the initial repeat-dose toxicity study 
and the 6 follow-on investigative studies. In addition, slides from 3 animals with mild and moderate 
myocardial inflammation from the historical database were also included in the review. 
It is acknowledged that extensive efforts were made to further examine the unexpected heart 
findings. The additional studies were well designed and the evaluation by an independent pathology 
working group is appreciated. 
During the evaluation procedure, the applicant provided additional data in support of the notion 
that the cardiac lesions were rabbit-specific, incidental or caused by stress.  
2.5.4.2.  Genotoxicity/ carcinogenicity 
No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with 20vPnC. In line with the 
relevant EMA and WHO Guidelines, non-clinical studies evaluating genotoxicity or carcinogenicity 
are not required for vaccines.  
2.5.4.3.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
The combined fertility and developmental study (including teratogenicity and postnatal 
investigations) in rabbits is considered appropriate to detect the effects of 20vPnC on fertility and 
pre- and postnatal development in pregnant and lactating female F0 animals and on in utero and 
postnatal development of the offspring. 20vPnC was administered by IM injection at the intended 
human dose on 4 treatment days (17 and 4 days before mating and on GD 10 and GD 24). 
Suitability of the animal model was demonstrated by immune response to the vaccine as 
determined by serum antibody measurements in F0 females, foetuses and pups.  
Based on the results of this study, IM administration of 20vPnC before and during gestation to 
female rabbits did not cause maternal systemic toxicity. Further, there were no 20vPnC-related 
effects on mating performance or fertility in female rabbits or on embryo-foetal or postnatal 
survival, growth, or development in the F1 offspring. 
2.5.4.4.  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance was examined in female NZW rabbits after administration of a single 0.5 mL 
subcutaneous injection of 20vPnC. Non-adverse erythema, oedema, and mass at the injection site 
were observed in that study. This tissue response at the injection site is considered an expected 
response to vaccines with aluminium-based adjuvants. In order to better elucidate the effect of the 
adjuvant, however, it would have been preferable to run a vehicle control group in parallel. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 23/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
2.5.4.5.  Other toxicity studies 
No antigenicity, immunotoxicity and dependence studies, and no studies on metabolites and 
impurities were submitted. According to relevant guidance on non-clinical vaccine development, 
this is acceptable. Immunogenicity was assessed in the pharmacology studies and in several of the 
toxicity studies.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment has not been submitted. The absence of an ERA for vaccines is 
in accordance with CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 and therefore acceptable. Discussion 
on non-clinical aspects 
2.5.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
In general, the scope of the non-clinical programme is in line with applicable guidelines for the 
development of a vaccine and is considered adequate. 
The vaccine lots used in non-clinical studies should be adequately representative of the formulation 
intended for clinical investigation and, ideally, should be the same lots as used in clinical studies. 
According to the Quality part of the dossier, minor differences are present in the analytical data for 
nonclinical toxicity study and clinical study drug product lots. However, they are not considered to 
impact the results of the respective studies. 
Pharmacology studies conducted with mice, rats and rabbits demonstrated humoral and functional 
immunogenicity of 20vPnC and the monovalent conjugates of the seven new serotypes contained 
in it, respectively. In addition, rabbits receiving the full human dose of 20vPnC by two occasions 
elicited a robust humoral response that was both specific for PnPS and associated with functional 
killing of the bacterium.  
The initial toxicity assessment for 20vPnC consisted of three GLP-compliant studies in rabbits, 
including a pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study, a fertility and developmental toxicity study and a 
local tolerance study. Following signs of cardiotoxicity in the pivotal toxicity study, a series of 
investigative studies was conducted to understand the potential causative factors of the heart 
findings observed in the pivotal toxicity study. The weight of evidence from these investigative 
activities indicates that the heart findings were not related to the vaccine conjugates or other 
vaccine components. This conclusion is based on several observations from the series of 
investigative studies and was supported by an external pathologist working group. 
In the pivotal toxicity study in rabbits, injection site findings consisting of minimal to moderate 
chronic-active inflammation and degeneration/necrosis of myofibers as well as injection site 
reactogenicity were observed. The severity of these reactions in the 20vPnC-dosed animals was 
comparable to the vehicle group and all injection site findings and reactogenicity were considered 
non-adverse in this study. Microscopic findings of inflammation with degeneration/necrosis of 
cardiomyocytes and interstitial fibrosis in the heart were observed in three animals treated with 
20vPnC.  
The submission also contains a combined fertility and developmental study (including teratogenicity 
and postnatal investigations) in rabbits. Based on the results of this study, IM administration of 
20vPnC before and during gestation to female rabbits did not cause maternal systemic toxicity. 
Further, there were no 20vPnC-related effects on mating performance or fertility in female rabbits 
or on embryo-foetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the F1 offspring. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 24/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In a local subcutaneous tolerance study in female rabbits, non-adverse erythema, oedema, and 
mass at the injection site were observed. This tissue response at the injection site is considered an 
expected response to vaccines with aluminium-based adjuvants 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical pharmacology studies provided evidence that 20vPnC induces functional 
antibody activity, which is expected to protect against pneumococcal infection.  
The toxicity studies revealed local effects that can be expected for an aluminium-adjuvanted 
vaccine. Histopathologic findings in the hearts of rabbits were observed in the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies and were further examined in a serious of investigative studies. It is overall concluded that 
the findings were incidental, or stress induced and do not raise specific safety concerns. 
From a non-clinical point of view, there are no objections against the market approval of 20vPnC.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
No clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with 20vPnC were conducted as these studies are not 
routinely conducted as part of the evaluation of vaccines, as described in the CHMP “Guidance on 
Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005). 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Immunogenicity represents the PD effect of the vaccine. Results are described and assessed below in 
section 2.6.5. 
Mechanism of action 
20vPnC contains 20 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides all conjugated to a CRM197 carrier 
protein, which modifies the immune response to the polysaccharide from a T-cell independent response 
to a T-cell dependent response. The T-cell dependent response leads to both an enhanced antibody 
response and generation of memory B cells, allowing for an anamnestic (booster) response on re-
exposure to the bacteria.  
Vaccination with 20vPnC induces serum antibody production and immunologic memory against the 
serotypes contained within the vaccine.  
In adults, the levels of circulating antibodies that correlate with protection against pneumococcal 
disease have not been clearly defined. 
Assays 
In the clinical programme, vaccine-induced, serotype-specific immune responses in the form of 
opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and IgG for all 20 serotypes included in 20vPnC were measured using 
microcolony OPA assay and direct-binding Luminex immunoassays (dLIA), respectively. Evaluation of 
serotype-specific OPA responses was the primary objective of the Phase 3 studies supporting licensure; 
evaluation of serotype-specific total IgG responses was only performed in the Phase 1 and 2 studies. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Vaccination with 20vPnC induces serum antibody production against 20 pneumococcal serotypes 
contained in the vaccine. Protection against pneumococcal disease is thought to be mediated by 
opsonophagocytic mechanisms.  
No PK studies were conducted which is acceptable and in accordance with the respective EMA 
documents.  
This MAA is based on an immune-bridging approach between 20vPnC and the previously licensed 
vaccines with known efficacy (13vPnC and PPSV23). The strategy relies on a comparative evaluation of 
induction of binding antibodies (Phase 1 & 2 studies) and functional opsonophagocytic antibodies (all 
clinical studies). As no correlate of protection against pneumococcal disease exists in adults, OPA GMTs 
are commonly used as surrogate thereof, which is endorsed. Immunogenicity represents the PD effect 
of the vaccine and is considered main evidence for this MAA since no efficacy studies were conducted 
(see Clinical Efficacy). 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 28/120 
 
  
 
 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pivotal evidence for this Marketing Authorisation Application is based on induction of opsonophagocytic 
antibodies by 20vPnC compared to vaccination with authorised vaccines (13PnC and PPSV23), which is 
acceptable. 
Microcolony OPA assays and direct-binding Luminex immunoassays (dLIA) were used to measure 
opsonophagocytic activity and IgG, respectively. The microcolony opsonophagocytic assay to detect 
functional antibodies is considered validated and fit for purpose.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy (immunogenicity) 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose-finding studies were performed. 20vPnC contains the same number of pneumococcal 
polysaccharides per serotype as 13vPnC: 2.2 μg pneumococcal polysaccharide per serotype (4.4 μg for 
serotype 6B) per single dose of 0.5 mL IM. 
Study B7471001 (Phase 1) 
Study B7471001 was a phase 1 FIH, randomised, controlled (2-arm parallel design), observer-blinded 
trial, conducted at one site in the US to compare the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC to a 
tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (Adacel) in 66 healthy adults aged 18 to 49 
years (randomised 1:1). 
Baseline OPA GMTs of all 20 serotypes were generally similar in the 20vPnC and Tdap groups. There 
was an increase in OPA GMTs from Day 0 to 1 month after vaccination for all 20 serotypes only in the 
20vPnC group. The OPA GMTs measured 1 month after vaccination were higher in the group receiving 
20vPnC compared to Tdap with no overlap in 95% CIs. The results were confirmed with OPA GMFRs 
and the proportion of subjects with an OPA titre ≥ LLOQ. Similar results were observed with IgG GMCs 
and GMFRs, respectively. 
2.6.5.2.  Main studies  
The immunogenicity data obtained in studies B7471007 and B7471006 are considered as the main 
evidence for this MAA. Combined, both studies represent the target population for pneumococcal 
vaccination. 
Study B7471007, is the pivotal Phase 3, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind non-inferiority 
trial in pneumococcal vaccine naïve adults ≥18 years of age (with the majority ≥ 60 years of age). The 
study also includes non-immunocompromised participants with risk factors for pneumococcal disease. 
This study provides the main evidence for the immunological bridge via different steps represented by 
the primary and secondary objectives. Participants (target n= 3880) were enrolled in three cohorts and 
randomised to receive 20vPnC or control (13vPnC groups in Cohorts 2 and 3 were controls for safety 
only):

Figure 1: Design of study B7471007 
Study B7471006 was a phase 3, randomised, multicentre, controlled, open-label trial to evaluate the 
safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC in adults ≥65 years of age with prior pneumococcal vaccination.  
Approximately 875 adults ≥65 years of age were targeted to be enrolled into three different cohorts 
(A, B, C) based on their prior pneumococcal vaccination history. 
•  Cohort A: Approximately 375 participants who had received PPSV23 ≥1 to ≤5 years previously 
but had not been vaccinated with 13vPnC were to be randomised (2:1) to receive either 
20vPnC or 13vPnC (control for safety only). 
•  Cohort B: Approximately 375 participants who had received 13vPnC ≥6 months previously, but 
had not been vaccinated with PPSV23, were to be randomised (2:1) to receive either 20vPnC 
or PPSV23 (control for safety only). 
•  Cohort C: Approximately 125 participants who had previously received 13vPnC followed by 
PPSV23 (PPSV23 vaccination must have been given ≥1 year prior to vaccination in this study) 
were to receive 20vPnC.

Page 33/120 
 
  
 
 
 
B7471007 (pivotal study): The study was sponsor, participant, and investigator blinded. Vaccination 1 
was to be administered in a double-blind fashion, as the appearance and prefilled syringes of 20vPnC 
and 13vPnC were identical. At Vaccination 2 (Cohort 1 only), the PI was supposed to assign the 
responsibility of administering saline and PPSV23 to third-party unblinded site staff who was not to 
participate in the evaluation of any study subject.  
•  Statistical methods 
B7471007: Analysis sets 
Immunogenicity Populations 
Three evaluable immunogenicity populations were defined for the analyses of the immunogenicity 
data: the evaluable 13-matched immunogenicity population (Cohort 1), the evaluable 7-additional 
immunogenicity population (Cohort 1), and the evaluable-20 immunogenicity population. In addition, 
the all-available immunogenicity population was defined as well.  
Subjects were to be included in the vaccine group as randomised. 
All-Available Immunogenicity Population 
This population included all participants who received at least 1 dose of 20vPnC, 13vPnC, PPSV23, or 
saline and had at least 1 valid and determinate OPA titre after any vaccination. For cohort-specific 
analysis, the need for all-available tables was assessed separately within each cohort. Only the 
evaluable population was used for the immunogenicity analyses if there was less than a 5% difference 
in sample size between the all-available and evaluable populations, (ie, if the evaluable sample size 
was ≥95% of the all-available sample size). 
For the cross-cohort analysis where Cohort 2 or Cohort 3 was being compared to the participants 60 
through 64 years of age in Cohort 1, if either cohort in the comparison had less than a 5% difference 
in sample size between the all-available and evaluable populations (ie, if the evaluable sample size was 
≥95% of the all-available sample size), analyses would be based on the evaluable populations only. 
Evaluable 13-Matched Immunogenicity Population, Evaluable 7-Additional Immunogenicity Population 
and Evaluable-20 Immunogenicity Population 
The applicant defined specific primary analysis populations for immunogenicity results of the serotypes 
included in the respective analysis. The populations are defined similarly based on valid respective OPA 
titres, appropriate randomisation and vaccination(s) etc. (for detailed definitions of the analysis sets 
please refer to the clinical AR). 
Safety population 
The safety population will include any subject who: 
1. receives 1 dose of any of the following: 20vPnC, 13vPnC, PPSV23, or saline; and 
2. has safety follow-up after any vaccination. 
Subjects will be included in the vaccine group corresponding to the vaccine actually received. The 
safety population will be the analysis population for safety and reactogenicity endpoints.

Primary Immunogenicity objective 
Hypothesis testing was planned to be performed to assess noninferiority comparing the 20vPnC/saline 
vaccine group against the 13vPnC/PPSV23 vaccine group in Cohort 1 for each of the 20 serotype-
specific OPA titres. The null hypothesis for each serotype specific OPA titre was: 
where 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ln(0.5) corresponds to a 2-fold margin for noninferiority. 
ln(µA) is the natural log of the geometric mean OPA titre 1 month after 20vPnC administration 
for the 20vPnC/saline group. 
ln(µB) is the natural log of the geometric mean OPA titre 1 month after 13vPnC administration 
for the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group when the endpoint is the geometric mean OPA titre from 1 of 
the shared 13 serotypes in 13vPnC, or, 
ln(µB) is the natural log of the geometric mean OPA titre 1 month after PPSV23 administration 
for the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group when the endpoint is the geometric mean OPA titre from 1 of 
the 7 additional serotypes. 
The primary analysis approach was to be based on a linear regression model. For the comparison of 
OPA results in Cohort 1, the following terms will be included in the regression model: corresponding 
baseline OPA titre, age, sex (male or female), smoking status (current smoker, ex-smoker, never 
smoked), and vaccine group. The difference between these least squares (LS) means on the natural 
log scale and associated CI estimated from the linear regression model was to be transformed back to 
the original scale to obtain the GMR and CI. 2-sided 95% CIs were to be used for the noninferiority 
comparisons of the 20vPnC/saline group to the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group.  
As a sensitivity/robustness analysis, the unadjusted serotype-specific OPA GMR and 95%-CI was also 
planned to be calculated for each of the serotypes by calculating differences in means and 95% CIs on 
the natural log scale based on the t-distribution, then exponentiating the results. 
After the noninferiority between the 20vPnC/saline and 13vPnC/PPSV23 vaccine groups in Cohort 1 for 
each of the 7 additional serotypes was established, superiority of serotype-specific OPA titres 
comparing 20vPnC/saline to 13vPnC/PPSV23 was planned to be evaluated for the 7 additional 
serotypes. The 7 superiority hypotheses were planned to be tested at a 0.025 level (1-sided) with 
Hochberg’s step-up procedure to control the type I error rate. Since the superiority hypotheses for the 
7 additional serotypes were planned to be tested only after the noninferiority was achieved for the 7 
serotypes, the familywise type I error rate for all hypothesis assessments in Cohort 1 was considered 
well controlled. 
For Cohort 1, subgroup analyses by age group (60 through 64, 65 through 69, 70 through 79, and ≥80 
years of age), sex (male and female), and race (white, African American, and others [the rest 
combined]) for the following immunogenicity endpoints were planned to be performed: 
-  Serotype-specific OPA GMTs and the associated 95% CIs at baseline and 1 month after 
vaccination. 
-  GMFRs and the associated 95% CIs in serotype specific OPA titres from before to 1 month 
- 
- 
after vaccination. 
Proportion and the associated 95% CIs of subjects with a ≥4-fold rise in serotype-specific 
OPA titres from before to 1 month after vaccination. 
Proportion and the associated 95% CIs of subjects with serotype specific OPA titres ≥ 
LLOQ before and 1 month after vaccination. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 35/120 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Additionally, serotype specific OPA GMTs and the associated 95% CIs at baseline and 1 month after 
vaccination were planned to be summarised by country for subjects ≥65 years of age from Cohort 1. 
Secondary Immunogenicity objective 
Hypothesis testing was also planned to be performed to assess noninferiority comparing the 20 
serotype-specific OPA titres 1 month after vaccination in each of the 20vPnC groups in the younger 
cohorts (subjects 50 through 59 years of age in Cohort 2 and subjects 18 through 49 years of age in 
Cohort 3) against subjects 60 through 64 years of age from Cohort 1 one month after vaccination in 
the 20vPnC/saline group. Again, a 2-fold margin was planned to be used for each of the noninferiority 
hypothesis tests. The null hypothesis for each serotype specific OPA titre was: 
where 
• 
• 
• 
ln(0.5) corresponds to a 2-fold margin for noninferiority. 
ln(µC) is the natural log of the geometric mean OPA titre 1 month after 20vPnC 
administration for the younger group, subjects 50 through 59 years of age (Cohort 2) or 
subjects 18 through 49 years of age (Cohort 3). 
ln(µA) is the natural log of the geometric mean OPA titre 1 month after 20vPnC 
administration for subjects 60 through 64 years of age from Cohort 1. 
The analysis approach was planned to be based on a linear regression model. The following terms were 
to be included in the regression model: corresponding baseline OPA titre, sex (male or female), 
smoking status (current smoker, ex-smoker, never smoked), and cohort. Two separate regression 
models were to be fitted, one for comparing Cohort 2 results to Cohort 1 (subjects 60 through 64 years 
of age) results, and the other for comparing Cohort 3 results to Cohort 1 (subjects 60 through 64 
years of age) results. Only the OPA data from the 20vPnC/saline group in Cohort 1 (subjects 60 
through 64 years of age) and the OPA data from the 20vPnC group in Cohort 2/Cohort 3 were to be 
included in the regression models. 
The difference between these least squares (LS) means on the natural log scale and associated CI 
estimated from the linear regression model were to be transformed back to the original scale to obtain 
the GMR and CI. 2-sided 95% CIs were to be used for the noninferiority comparison of the 20vPnC 
group from Cohort 2/Cohort 3 to the 20vPnC/saline group from subjects 60 through 64 years of age in 
Cohort 1. 
Like in the primary analysis setting, as a sensitivity/robustness analysis, the unadjusted serotype-
specific OPA GMR and 95%-CI was also planned to be calculated for each of the serotypes by 
calculating differences in means and 95% CIs on the natural log scale based on the t-distribution, then 
exponentiating the results. 
In the SAP it was noted that these secondary noninferiority assessments comparing the younger age 
groups (Cohort 3 [subjects 18 through 49 years of age] or Cohort 2 [subjects 50 through 59 years of 
age]) to the subjects 60 through 64 years of age in Cohort 1 were considered meaningful only after the 
establishment of overall comparability between 20vPnC and the corresponding controls in Cohort 1. 
Therefore, there no increase in the type I error rate was formally seen at the planning stage, and no 
type I error adjustments were seen needed in the immunogenicity assessments for the 2 younger age 
cohorts (Cohort 2 or Cohort 3). 
For Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, subgroup analyses by sex (male and female) and race (white, African 
American, and others [the rest combined]) for serotype-specific GMTs and the associated 95% CIs 
were planned to be provided for the 20vPnC group only at both baseline and 1 month after vaccination.

Further secondary and exploratory immunogenicity endpoints and interim analysis 
B7471006: Analysis sets 
Safety population 
The safety population was to include any subject who received 1 dose of 20vPnC, PPSV23, or 13vPnC 
and had safety follow-up after vaccination. Subjects were to be included in the vaccine group 
corresponding to the vaccine actually received. The safety population was planned to be used as the 
analysis population for safety and reactogenicity endpoints. 
Evaluable Immunogenicity Populations 
The evaluable immunogenicity population was planned to include any subject who 
- receives 20vPnC as randomised, 
- is enrolled in the appropriate cohort based on prior pneumococcal vaccination history, 
- has the Visit 2 blood collection within 27 to 49 days after vaccination, 
- has at least 1 valid and determinate OPA titre for any serotype for Visit 2, and 
- does not have any other major protocol deviations as determined by the clinician. 
The evaluable immunogenicity population was planned to be the primary analysis population for 
immunogenicity results. 
All-available Immunogenicity Populations 
The all-available immunogenicity population was planned to include all subjects who receive 20vPnC, 
and had at least 1 valid and determinate OPA titre 1 month after vaccination. The all-available 
immunogenicity population was planned to be the secondary analysis population for immunogenicity 
analysis. Only the evaluable population was to be used for the summary of immunogenicity results if 
there was less than a 10% difference in sample size between the all-available and evaluable 
populations. 
Statistical analysis methods 
Safety/reactogenicity results were summarised by standard statistical analysis methods as described in 
detail in the SAP, separately for each cohort.   
Immunogenicity results of serotype specific OPA titres were to be determined only for subjects who 
received 20vPnC in each cohort as subjects who received 13vPnC or PPSV23 were included in the study 
served as the control for safety. Immunogenicity results from the 20vPnC groups were to be 
summarised side by side from all 3 cohorts. For immunogenicity results of serotype-specific OPA titres, 
geometric mean titres (GMTs) as well as geometric mean-fold rises (GMFR) were to be computed along 
with associated 95% CIs. 
Standard descriptive statistical methodology was pre-planned to summarise: Subject disposition, 
demographic characteristics, prior vaccination status, and medical history.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Study B7471007 
In total 3902 participants were enrolled in the following cohorts based on age: 
•  Cohort  1:  subjects  ≥  60  yoa  (n=3009;  randomised  1:1  to  receive  either  20vPnC/saline  or 
13vPnC/PPSV23) 
•  Cohort 2: 50-59 yoa (n=445; randomised 3:1 to receive 20vPnC or 13vPnC)  
•  Cohort 3: 18-49 yoa (n=448; randomised 3:1 to receive 20vPnC or 13vPnC)  
Primary objectives: Non-inferiority of 20vPnC to comparator in adults ≥60 years of age 
(Cohort 1) 
13 shared serotypes:  
20vPnC met the primary immunogenicity objective for the 13 matched vaccine serotypes. One month 
after 20vPnC or 13vPnC, the immune responses to all 13 matched serotypes induced by 20vPnC were 
non-inferior to those induced by 13vPnC, as demonstrated by the lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% CIs 
for the primary analysis of model-based OPA GMRs (20vPnC relative to 13vPnC group) >0.5 (2-fold NI 
margin).

Note: Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 ✕ LLOQ in the analysis. 
GMTs and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the LS means and the corresponding CIs based on analysis of log-transformed OPA titres using a 
regression model with vaccine group, sex, smoking status, age at vaccination in years (continuous), and baseline log transformed OPA titres. 
GMRs (ratio of GMTs 20vPnC/saline to 13vPnC/PPSV23) and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS means and the corresponding

Seven additional serotypes: 
20vPnC met the primary immunogenicity objective for 6 of the 7 additional serotypes. One month after 
20vPnC or PPSV23, the immune responses to 6 of the 7 additional vaccine serotypes induced by 
20vPnC were non-inferior to those induced by PPSV23, as demonstrated by the lower bounds of the 2-
sided 95% CIs for the primary analysis of model based OPA GMRs (20vPnC/saline relative to 
13vPnC/PPSV23 group) >0.5.  
Although superiority of 20vPnC to PPSV23 couldn't be formally evaluated due to a missed NI for 1 
serotype (serotype 8) as per the statistical analysis plan, the lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% CIs for 
the GMRs were >1, with nominal p values for superiority <0.001 for the 6 serotypes.

Additional results for serotype 8: 
For serotype 8, the model-based GMR (2-sided 95% CI) was 0.55 (0.49, 0.62), narrowly missing the 
statistical non-inferiority criterion. Based on additional analyses that further characterize the immune 
responses to serotype 8, the immune response is expected to provide protection similar to the other 
19 vaccine serotypes in 20vPnC that met non-inferiority: 
•  A GMFR of 22.1 was observed for serotype 8 from before to 1 month after 20vPnC, which is 
within the range of the observed GMFRs (5.8 for serotype 3 to 42.6 for serotype 6A) for the 13 
matched serotypes from before to 1 month after 13vPnC.  
•  After 20vPnC, 77.8% of subjects achieved a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres from before to 1 month 
after vaccination for serotype 8, which is within the range of proportions observed (54.0% for 
serotype 14 to 84.0% for serotype 6A) for the 13 matched serotypes after 13vPnC.  
Secondary objectives: Non-inferiority of 20vPnC in younger age groups (Cohort 2 and 3) 
compared with adults 60 through 64 years of age (subset of Cohort 1) 
20vPnC met the secondary immunogenicity objective for all 20 vaccine serotypes based on

and comparison of the immune responses in subjects 18 through 49 years of age (Cohort 3) to 
those in subjects 60 through 64 years of age in Cohort 1 (Figure 5, Table 16).  
One month after 20vPnC, the immune responses to all 20 vaccine serotypes in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 
were non-inferior to those in Cohort 1 subjects 60 through 64 years of age. The lower bounds of the 2-
sided 95% CIs for the primary analysis of model-based OPA GMRs (younger cohort relative to Cohort 1 
subjects 60 through 64 years of age) were >0.5 (2-fold NI margin). The finding of higher responses in 
younger adults compared with older adults is consistent with the experience with 13vPnC.

Additional  data  to  illustrate  the  immune  response  of  20vPnC  compared  to  13vPnC  (ad  hoc 
analysis by the Rapporteur) 
For cohort 2 and 3 no comparison between both vaccines was intended in the study, nevertheless GMT 
data for both cohorts for 13vPnC were available and are shown below.  
Immune response elicited by 20vPnC is consistently numerically lower in all cohorts compared to 13vPnC 
for  the  13vPnC  serotypes.  In  Cohort  2,  including  50-59-year-old  subjects,  the  difference  seems  even 
more  pronounced,  although  the  conclusions  are  somewhat  hampered  by  the  smaller  sample  size  for 
13vPnC. The observations of reduced response are further confirmed with the proportion of subjects with 
a  ≥4-fold  rise.  Similar  reductions  have  also  been  observed  in  the  lot  consistency  study  B7471008 
(13vPnC was included mainly as control arm for the safety assessment, see section 2.6.5.5 for further 
details  of  this  study)  and  a  paediatric  study,  submitted  by  the  applicant  (B7471003),  although  this 
population is not part of the current indication (study not further described in this report).

Abbreviations:  GMFR  =  geometric  mean  fold  rise;  GMT  =  geometric  mean  titre;  LLOQ  =  lower  limit  of  quantitation;  OPA  = 
opsonophagocytic activity. 
Note: Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 ✕ LLOQ in the analysis. 
a. n = Number of subjects with valid and determinate assay results to the specified serotype from both before and 1 month after 
vaccination blood sample collections. 
b. GMTs, GMFRs, and the corresponding 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres or fold rises 
and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution).

Selected exploratory endpoint: Immune response by risk status 
Approximately one-third of the total evaluable subjects across all 3 cohorts combined had risk factors 
for serious pneumococcal disease (648 subjects), including diabetes mellitus (13.9%), smoking 
(12.8%), chronic pulmonary disease including asthma (8.5%), medical conditions related to chronic 
cardiovascular disease (5.3%), and liver disease (0.4%).  
The initial analysis was criticised by the Rapporteurs and the applicant has performed an additional  
unplanned ad hoc analysis for the participants with and without risk factors by each age cohort in the 
B7471007 study (≥60 years [Cohort 1], 50–59 years [Cohort 2], and 18–49 years of age [Cohort 3]).  
The study was not designed or powered for any formal between-group comparisons in this ad hoc 
analysis.  The 13vPnC arms in Cohorts 2 and 3 were included for safety only, however the 
immunogenicity in all cohorts was measured to maintain blinding during the assay work.  Additionally, 
because the number of participants 18 through 49 years of age in B7471007 is somewhat small when 
split into those subpopulations, an analysis was performed among participants in this age range from 
B7471007 pooled with the participants from B7471008 (all 18–49 years of age) to increase the 
precision. Note that the 13vPnC control group in Study B7471008 was included for safety only, 
however the immunogenicity in all groups was measured to maintain blinding during the assay work. 
There was no other study that overlapped with the adults 50 through 59 years of age. Post hoc 
supplemental data on the proportion of subjects with ≥4-fold rises in OPA titres from before to 1 
month after vaccination are summarised in the tables below.

Substantial increases in OPA GMTs from before to 1 month after 20vPnC were observed in subjects 
with and without risk factors in all cohorts. 20vPnC elicited OPA GMTs in the participants with risk 
factors that were observed to be slightly lower for several serotypes than in participants without risk 
factors. This trend was consistent in both the 20vPnC group and the corresponding control group — 
13vPnC for the 13 serotypes and PPSV23 for the 7 additional serotypes. In participants ≥60 years of 
age with risk factors, approximately 50% to 80% of participants responded to 20vPnC with a ≥4-fold 
increase in OPA titre to the vaccine serotypes, as did approximately 40% to 90% of those 50 through 
59 and 18 through 49 years of age. The sample size becomes relatively small in the subsets of the 
younger populations (for example, as low as 30 participants in 50 through 59 years of age) so that 
results in a few subjects may have a disproportionate effect and increased overall variabilities in the 
summary.

Abbreviations: GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre; LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; LS = least squares; OPA = opsonophagocytic 
activity. Note: Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 ✕ LLOQ in the analysis. 
a. Group with risk factors includes subjects with one or more medical history conditions or other factors (smoker) that puts them with an increased risk for 
serious pneumococcal disease; group with no risk factors includes subjects without an identified medical condition or other factors that would put them with 
an increased risk for serious pneumococcal disease. 
b. n = Number of subjects with valid and determinate OPA titters for the specified serotype. 
c. GMTs and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the LS means and the corresponding CIs based on analysis of log-transformed OPA titres using 
a regression model with vaccine group, sex, age at vaccination in years (continuous), and baseline log transformed OPA titres. 
d. GMRs (ratio of GMTs 20vPnC to 13vPnC) and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS means and the corresponding CIs based 
on the same regression model as above.

a. Group with risk factors includes subjects with one or more medical history conditions or other factors (smoker) that puts them with an increased risk for 
serious pneumococcal disease; group with no risk factors includes subjects without an identified medical condition or other factors that would put them with 
an increased risk for serious pneumococcal disease. 
b. n = Number of subjects with valid and determinate OPA titres for the specified serotype. 
c. GMTs and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the LS means and the corresponding CIs based on analysis of log-transformed OPA titres using 
a regression model with vaccine group, sex, age at vaccination in years (continuous), and baseline log transformed OPA titres. 
d. GMRs (ratio of GMTs 20vPnC to 13vPnC) and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS means and the corresponding CIs based 
on the same regression model as above.

Study B7471006 
Participants were enrolled into different cohorts based on pneumococcal vaccination history: 
•  Cohort A: Approximately 375 participants who had received PPSV23 ≥1 to ≤5 years previously 
but had not been vaccinated with 13vPnC were to be randomised (2:1) to receive either 
20vPnC or 13vPnC (control for safety only). 
•  Cohort B: Approximately 375 participants who had received 13vPnC ≥6 months previously, but 
had not been vaccinated with PPSV23, were to be randomised (2:1) to receive either 20vPnC 
or PPSV23 (control for safety only). 
•  Cohort C: Approximately 125 participants who had previously received 13vPnC followed by 
PPSV23 (PPSV23 vaccination must have been given ≥1 year prior to vaccination in this study) 
were to receive 20vPnC. 
Primary Immunogenicity Endpoint  
Pneumococcal serotype specific OPA GMTs: 
• At 1 month after 20vPnC, OPA GMTs for most of the 20 vaccine serotypes tended to be numerically 
highest in participants with prior 13vPnC only, ranging from 54.3 (serotype 3) to 4156.5 (serotype 
22F) and lowest in participants with prior PPSV23 only, ranging from 31.1 (serotype 3) to 2026.2 
(serotype 33F). OPA GMTs in participants with prior 13vPnC and PPSV23 generally fell in between, 
ranging from 39.3 (serotype 3) to 2717.8 (serotype 22F).

Note: Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ in the analysis. GMTs and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of 
the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints  
Serotype-specific pneumococcal OPA GMFRs From Before to 1 Month After Vaccination: 
Increases in OPA titres for all 20 vaccine serotypes were observed based on OPA GMFRs from before to 
1 month after 20vPnC in all 3 cohorts, regardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination. Immune 
responses to the 7 additional serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC from participants with prior 13vPnC only 
(Cohort B) were substantially higher than before vaccination with 20vPnC. 
For the 13vPnC serotypes, the GMFRs appeared to be generally highest in Cohort B (prior 13vPnC 
only), ranging from 2.3 (serotypes 5 and 14) to 9.3 (serotype 23F), followed by Cohort A (prior 
PPSV23 only), ranging from 1.8 (serotype 14) to 12.6 (serotype 6A) and lowest in Cohort C (prior 
13vPnC and PPSV23), ranging from 1.6 (serotype 7F) to 6.5 (serotype 6A); however, differences were 
small, and as noted above, baseline titres to these serotypes were also higher in participants with prior 
13vPnC and PPSV23 relative to participants with prior PPSV23 only. As PPSV23 does not contain the 
polysaccharide for serotype 6A, participants previously vaccinated with PPSV23 only were naïve to 
vaccination for that serotype. 
For the 7 additional serotypes, GMFRs were higher in participants with prior 13vPnC only, who were 
naïve to these vaccine serotypes prior to receiving 20vPnC, ranging from 5.4 (serotype 33F) to 66.9 
(serotype 22F), than in participants with prior PPSV23 only, ranging from 1.8 (serotype 33F) to 11.1 
(serotype 22F), and in participants with prior 13vPnC and PPSV23, ranging from 1.8 (serotype 33F) to 
9.8 (serotype 22F).

Proportion of Participants Achieving a ≥4-Fold Rise in serotype-specific Pneumococcal OPA Titres From 
Before to 1 Month After Vaccination: 
For most of the 13vPnC serotypes, the proportions of participants who achieved a ≥4-fold rise in OPA 
titres from before to 1 month after 20vPnC were generally numerically highest in Cohort B (prior 
13vPnC only), ranging from 24.9% (serotype 14) to 58.7% (serotype 23F), followed by Cohort A (prior 
PPSV23 only), ranging from 15.7% (serotype 14) to 61.5% (serotype 6A). The proportions of 
participants who achieved a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres from before to 1 month after 20vPnC were 
lowest in Cohort C (prior 13vPnC and PPSV23), ranging from 14.3% (serotype 7F) to 44.9% (serotype 
6A). 
For the 7 additional serotypes, the proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres from 
before to 1 month after 20vPnC were higher in participants with prior 13vPnC only, who were naïve to 
these vaccine serotypes prior to receiving 20vPnC, ranging from 53.6% (serotype 33F) to 83.2% 
(serotype 22F), than in participants with prior PPSV23 only, ranging from 18.7% (serotype 33F) to 
57.0% (serotype 22F) and participants with prior 13vPnC and PPSV23, ranging from 19.2% (serotype 
33F) to 54.8% (serotype 22F).

Evaluable 13-Matched Immunogenicity Population 
This population generally included any participant who: 
1. received the assigned Vaccination 1 (20vPnC or 13vPnC) as randomised, 
2.  was  enrolled  in  the  appropriate  cohort  based  on  age  on  the  day  of  first 
vaccination (ie, 60 years of age or older in Cohort 1), 
3. had the Visit 2 blood collection within 27 to 49 days after Vaccination 1, 
4. had at least 1 valid OPA titre for any of the 13 matched serotypes at Visit 2, 
5. had no other major PDs as determined by the clinician. 
Time point: OPA GMTs one month after vaccination with 20vPnC or 13vPnC 
The immune responses to the 13-matched vaccine serotypes induced by 20vPnC 
were non-inferior to those induced by 13vPnC. 
OPA  GMT  ratios  [20vPnC/13vPnC]  were  consistently  around  0.8.  The  clinical 
relevance of this reduction in most serotypes is unknown as well as the clinical 
relevance of the applied NI margin.

Evaluable 7-Additional Immunogenicity Population 
This population generally included any participant who: 
1. received Vaccination 1 (20vPnC) if randomised to the 20vPnC/saline group or 
received both vaccinations as randomised if randomised to the 13vPnC/PPSV23 
group, 
2. was enrolled in the appropriate cohort based on age on the day Evaluable-20 
Immunogenicity Population of first vaccination (ie, 60 years of age and older in 
Cohort 1), 
3. had either Visit 2 blood collection within 27 to 49 days after Vaccination 1 for 
the  20vPnC/saline group  or  Visit  3 blood  collection  within 27  to  49  days  after 
Vaccination 2 (PPSV23) for the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group, 
4.  had  at  least  1  valid  and  determinate  OPA  titre  for  any  of  the  7  additional 
serotypes  at  either  Visit  2  for  the  20vPnC/saline  group  or  Visit  3  for  the 
13vPnC/PPSV23 group, 
5. had no other major PDs as determined by the clinician. 
Time point: OPA GMTs one month after vaccination with 20vPnC or PPSV23 
The  immune  responses  to  6  of  the  7  additional  vaccine  serotypes  induced  by 
20vPnC were non-inferior to those induced by PPSV23. 
Reduced response to serotype 8 was observed compared to PPSV23. Serotype 8 
is still one of the most prevalent serotypes causing IPD and pneumonia in the 
EU.  Based  on  additional  analyses  that  further  characterize  the  immune 
responses to serotype 8, the immune response is expected to provide protection 
similar to the other 19 vaccine serotypes in 20vPnC that met non-inferiority.

Note 
It is known also from 13vPnC that immune response declines with age. 
A comparison to 13vPnC was not intended but the post-hoc analysis performed 
by  the  applicant  showed  numerically  lower  immune  response  to  20vPnC 
compared to 13vPnC overall similar to cohort 1. 
OPA titres for this cohort are above the titres induced by 13vPnC in cohort 1, 
which is assumed to provide a protective effect.

Results 
Note 
Immune responses to all 20 vaccine serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC were 
observed in adults ≥18 years of age with and without increased risk for serious 
pneumococcal disease based on OPA GMTs, GMFRs, proportions of participants 
achieving a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres, and proportions of participants with OPA 
titres ≥ LLOQ. 
OPA GMTs for patients with risk factors were approx. 20% lower compared to 
subjects  without  risk  factors.  An  analysis  combining  subjects  from  all  cohorts 
was performed, as well as a post-hoc comparative analysis by age cohorts. It is 
not known whether induced titres for patients with risk factors are representative 
for protection.

Participants were included in the vaccine group as randomised in the analyses 
Time points: Day 1 before vaccination and 1 Month after vaccination 
At  1  month  after  20vPnC,  OPA  GMTs  for  most  of  the  20  vaccine  serotypes 
tended to be numerically highest in participants with prior 13vPnC only, ranging 
from  54.3  (serotype  3)  to  4156.5  (serotype  22F)  and  lowest  in  participants 
with prior PPSV23 only, ranging from 31.1 (serotype 3) to 2026.2 (33F). OPA 
GMTs in participants with prior 13vPnC and PPSV23 generally fell in between 
ranging from 39.3 (serotype 3) to 2717.8 (22F).

Results 
Notes 
For  the  13vPnC  serotypes,  higher  OPA  GMFRs  and  higher  proportions  of 
participants with ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres were noted in cohort B compared to 
cohort A and C. 
For  the  additional  7  serotypes,  GMFRs  were  larger  and  proportions  of 
participants with a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres were higher in cohort B compared 
to cohort A and C. 
Immune responses differed considerably between cohorts.  
No comparison to 13vPnC or PPSV23 is possible.  
2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Children: No data has been submitted for children < 18 yoa, as the target population for this MAA are 
adults ≥18 yoa. Studies in children with 20vPnC are currently ongoing. A PIP was discussed with the 
PDCO and a deferral was agreed. 
Elderly: This population is generally considered as one of the most vulnerable for pneumococcal 
disease and is included in the studied population. Compared to younger populations studied (18-49 yoa 
and 50-59 yoa), a generally lower humoral immune response (based on OPA GMTs) was induced by 
20vPnC (and 13vPnC). This is not unexpected and in line with other (pneumococcal) vaccines.

Renal and hepatic impairment: No explicit studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment were 
performed. However, subjects with general risk factors for pneumococcal disease were enrolled in the 
main studies, potentially including respective patients. Respectively, the number of subjects with renal 
or hepatic impairment who received 20vPnC was very low.

Study B7471008 (Phase 3), lot-to-lot consistency 
This was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study with a 4-arm parallel design 
conducted in the US in approximately 1610 adults 18- 49 years of age with no history of pneumococcal 
vaccination. Participants were randomised into 1 of 4 groups in a 2:2:2:1 ratio (20vPnC Lot 1; 20vPnC 
Lot 2; 20vPnC Lot 3; 13vPnC) by site-based randomisation. 
The primary safety objective was to describe the safety profile of 20vPnC in the study population.  The 
13vPnC arm was included as a control for safety assessments. 
The pre-specified equivalence criteria were met for all comparisons between 20vPnC lots. The 2-sided 
95% CIs for the model-based estimate of serotype-specific OPA GMRs 1 month after vaccination for 
each pair of lot comparisons (Lot 1/Lot 2, Lot 1/Lot 3, and Lot 2/Lot 3) are contained in the pre-
specified interval (0.5, 2.0) for each of the 20 serotypes (Figure below). 
OPA GMFRs, proportion of participants with ≥ 4-fold rise in OPA Pneumococcal Titres, and proportion 
of participants with OPA titres ≥ LLOQ were generally similar across all three lots supporting lot 
equivalence.. These results are discussed with the results of the main studies under “ancillary 
analyses”.

Study B7471002 (Phase 2) 
This was a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind study (2-arm parallel 
design conducted in the US) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine in 444 healthy, pneumococcal vaccine naïve adults 60 through 64 years of age 
(randomised 1:1 to receive either 20vPnC/saline or 13vPnC/PPSV23 one month apart). 
Study results 
For each of the 13vPnC serotypes, the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for OPA GMTs 1 month after 
Vaccination 1 overlapped in the vaccine groups, although this was marginal for 19F. 
For the seven additional serotypes, the 95% CIs for the OPA GMTs 1 month after Vaccination 1 for 
the 20vPnC/saline group and 1 month after Vaccination 2 for the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group did not 
overlap for serotypes 10A, 15B, 22F, and 8. The OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination with 20vPnC 
from the 20vPnC/saline group were higher than the OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination with 
PPSV23 from the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group for serotypes 10A, 15B, and 22F, but the OPA GMT from the 
20vPnC/saline group was lower than the OPA GMT from the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group for serotype 8. 
A 6-fold or higher OPA GMFR was observed for all 20 serotypes 1 month after vaccination with 
20vPnC. Overall, a similar tendency between treatment groups was seen as for the GMT analysis. 
Pneumococcal OPA GMTs for all serotypes increased substantially after vaccination and then declined 
but remained elevated above baseline levels (before vaccination) at 12 months after Vaccination 1. 
Examples of patterns of OPA GMTs across the time points for the 13 serotypes matched to 13vPnC 
are denoted by serotype 1 and 19F and for the seven additional serotypes are denoted by serotype 8 
and 10A.

Exact 2-sided CI based upon the observed proportion of subjects, calculated using the Clopper and Pearson method. 
Study B7471005 (Phase 1b) 
Study B7471005 was a phase 1b, randomised, controlled (3-arm parallel design), double-blind trial, 
conducted at 3 sites in the US, to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of multivalent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccines in approximately 99 healthy pneumococcal vaccine naïve Japanese adults 18-49 
yoa. Subjects were randomised equally 1:1:1 to receive a single dose of 20vPnC, c7vPnC (an 
unauthorised investigational vaccine including the 7 serotypes not included in 13vPnC) or 13vPnC as 
control group. 
Immunogenicity results 
One month after vaccination, increased OPA GMTs were observed for all serotypes in the respective 
groups. OPA GMFRs for all 20 serotypes with 20vPnC ranged between 6.1-fold (serotypes 3 and 11A) 
to 150.7-fold (serotype 8).  
The majority of participants vaccinated with 20vPnC achieved a ≥4-fold rise in OPA titres from before 
to 1 month after vaccination for all 20 serotypes (range: 54.8% (serotype 7F) to 97.0% (serotype 
23F)).

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applied indication for 20vPnC/Apexxnar, a 20-valent protein conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, is 
“active immunisation for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and pneumonia 
caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults ≥ 18 years of age”. Currently other vaccines are 
licensed for this indication in adults in the EU: e.g. Prevenar13 (13vPnC) and PNEUMOVAX23 
(PPSV23). Another pneumococcal vaccine is licensed but not for the intended adult population 
(Synflorix). The applicant is also the marketing authorisation holder of 13vPnC and 20vPnC is based on 
the same manufacturing process as Prevenar 13 (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 
19F and 23F) with 7 additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F and 33F). PPSV23 is an 
unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine containing 23 serotypes, including the serotypes of 20vPnC, 
except 6A, which is only included in 20vPnC and 13vPnC. The additional serotypes of PPSV23 are 2, 
9N, 17F, 20. Both vaccines are routinely used in European vaccination programmes. Both vaccines are 
used as comparators for this MAA. The choice of the comparator vaccines is considered acceptable and 
has been agreed in the scientific advice.  
Currently, no correlate of protection has been established in the adult population for pneumococcal 
vaccines. Consequently, efficacy has to be inferred via immunobridging between 20vPnC and vaccines 
with proven protective efficacy: 13vPnC (for the 13 shared serotypes) and PPSV23 (for the 7 additional 
serotypes). This immunobridging approach is in accordance with the respective EMA guidance 
(EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005) and scientific advice.  
The clinical programme for 20vPnC consists of six randomised controlled trials to study safety and 
immunogenicity of 20vPnC. Studies B7471007 (pivotal, pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects) and 
B7471006 (primed subjects) are considered as main evidence for this application as separate 
important aspects of the target population are covered (including relevant age groups, risk factors and 
pneumococcal vaccination history). Supportive data derives from two Phase 1 studies (B7471001 
(FIH), B7471005 (Japanese subjects)), a Phase 2 study (B7471002) and a Phase 3 lot consistency 
study (B7471008).  
No dedicated dose-finding studies were conducted for 20vPnC, since prior experience with its 
predecessor 13vPnC exists. Both 13vPnC and 20vPnC contain 2.2 μg pneumococcal polysaccharide per 
serotype (4.4 μg for serotype 6B) per single dose of 0.5 mL IM.  
No studies with 20vPnC have been performed to evaluate the ability to induce memory, the longevity 
of protection or boosting. Respective information should be extrapolated from 13vPnC given a robust 
bridge has been established. 
Design and conduct of main clinical studies 
The main evidence for the immunological bridge is generated in the pivotal study B7471007 in 
different steps represented by the primary and secondary objectives. The primary comparison between 
20vPnC and 13vPnC is performed in pneumococcal vaccine naïve adults ≥60 years of age (cohort 1) to 
establish non-inferiority of 20vPnC to 13vPnC in this age group. Subsequently, non-inferiority of the 
immune response elicited by 20vPnC should be established in 60-64-year-old subjects (a subset of 
cohort 1) and the younger cohorts 2 and 3 (50 - 59 and 18 - 49 years of age). No additional 
comparison between vaccines (20vPnC and 13vPnC or PPSV23) was intended for these cohorts. This 
approach to bridge to younger cohorts was previously discussed during the scientific advice procedure 
(EMEA/H/SA/3940/1/2018/III CORRIGENDUM). Since it is in line with the previous development 
programme of 13vPnC, it was considered appropriate, if it is confirmed that the vaccine is essentially 
EMA/12384/2022

the same medicinal product as 13vPnC, plus seven additional serotypes. According to the assessment 
of the quality part of the provided dossier, no differences are expected. However, the planned non-
inferiority margin (0.5) was seen critical in this advice as meeting this margin was not considered to 
ensure that adults 18 through 49 and 50 through 59 years of age will have non-inferior immune 
responses to 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC. The clinical (ir)relevance of the employed non-inferiority 
margins is currently not known. Additionally, it is known, also from 13vPnC, that immune response 
declines with age and it is to be expected that the immune response in younger subjects will be higher 
than in older subjects. Consequently, non-inferior immune response in the younger compared to the 
oldest cohort could be expected regardless of whether the immune response is comparable between 
20vPnC and 13vPnC or PPSV23 in younger subjects. The immunological bridge is further discussed with 
the respective results below.  
Study B7471006 enrolled subjects with prior vaccination history. This is considered a relevant part of 
the intended target population, since pneumococcal vaccines are already available for the adult 
population since several years or even decades in the case of PPSV23. Consequently, it is very likely 
that especially the older target population will have received at least one prior vaccination with either 
or both vaccines. Study B7471006 enrolled subjects ≥ 65 years of age into different cohorts based on 
their previously received different pneumococcal vaccination (13vPnC, PPSV23 or both sequentially 
(13vPnC/PPSV23), representing all common prior pneumococcal vaccinations. Unfortunately, the study 
was not designed to generate confirmatory evidence which would have been preferred and has several 
shortcomings, including the open label design, the descriptive reporting of results and the lack of 
immunogenicity data from a control arm to further substantiate the immunological bridge required for 
this MAA.  Nevertheless, the presented data are considered informative for this subset of the target 
population. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally comparable for both main studies. Differences relate 
to definition of relevant subject groups mainly based on age (B7471007) and prior pneumococcal 
vaccination status (B7471006) in line with the study objectives. The majority of subjects who received 
20vPnC were 60-69 years old (in total 1661; naïve: 1312; primed: 349). In addition, a total of 470 
subjects older than 70 years (naïve: 195; primed: 275) received 20vPnC. Overall, the included 
population is considered to adequately reflect the population ≥ 60 yoa, most vulnerable to 
pneumococcal disease. In addition, 334 subjects 50-59 yoa and 335 subjects 18-49 yoa received 
20vPnC in study B7471007. Supportive data for the youngest cohort (18-49 year) is also generated in 
the lot-to-lot consistency study (n=1463). The main evidence for the intended immunobridge was 
generated in pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects ≥ 60 yoa. This population is considered an adequate 
and sensitive population to establish the intended immunobridge since potential interactions with prior 
pneumococcal vaccinations can be excluded. 
The clinical development programme did not specifically aim to recruit subjects at specific risk for 
pneumococcal disease, e.g. with chronic comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease), 
behavioural habits (e.g. smoking) or subjects living in a community/environment with increased risk of 
disease transmission. Nevertheless, about 1/3 of all subjects enrolled in study B7471007 had risk 
factors for pneumococcal disease and a respective analysis comparing subjects with and without risk 
factors has been performed. No studies were performed in immunocompromised patients and the 
applicant argues that respective efficacy can be extrapolated from 13vPnC based on the characteristics 
of a conjugate vaccine. This can currently not fully be agreed on (see below). 
The submitted studies were mainly conducted in the US and at some study sites in Sweden. 
Consequently, the experience with 20vPnC in the European population is limited but prior global 
experience with 13vPnC and PPSV23 do not give rise to concerns regarding potential differences 
relevant for the European population.

The applicant used opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titres for the evaluation of immune response, 
which is endorsed and was agreed on during the scientific advice procedure. OPA titres are commonly 
used as surrogate markers for a protective effect as they reflect the in vivo scenario of antibody-
mediated protection. However, no correlate of protection has been established. Comparisons across 
serotypes are also not possible due to different capsule compositions, potentially resulting in different 
titres required for protection for each serotype. The complementary immunogenicity parameter of IgG 
concentrations was only used in the Phase 1 and 2 studies but not in the main studies. This is 
considered acceptable since OPA GMTs are considered a more relevant parameter.  
In all studies participants received a single dose of either vaccine (20vPnC, 13vPnC or PPSV23), which 
is in line with the approved regimen for 13vPnC and PPSV23. Immune responses were evaluated 
before and one month after vaccination. Serotype-specific OPA geometric mean titres (GMTs) at 1 
month after the respective vaccination were used as variables for the primary endpoints.  
Secondary endpoints to further assess the immune response included differences in geometric mean 
fold rises (GMFRs) in serotype-specific OPA titres, the proportion of subjects with a ≥4-fold OPA GMT 
rise from baseline and the proportion of subjects with titres above LLOQ. Immunogenicity objectives 
and endpoints are generally supported and are in line with the vaccine guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 Rev.1).  
In order to be able to evaluate the immune response of both comparator vaccines, 13vPnC and 
PPSV23 were given to the same subjects one month apart and the respective evaluation was 
performed separately for the respective serotypes one month after the respective vaccination. This 
dosing regimen is not representative for the commonly recommended sequential vaccination of 13vPnC 
and PPSV23. No data concerning a sequential vaccination, as commonly recommended in the EU (with 
an interval between vaccinations of several weeks up to 1 year, depending on the subject’s risk factors 
and age) was submitted neither with 20vPnC nor as comparison thereof. Respective information 
collected with 13vPnC could be extrapolated given a robust immunobridge. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, 20vPnC was immunogenic in all studies and subgroups tested, based on consistently elevated 
OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination compared to baseline.  
The main evidence for the immunological bridge to the comparator vaccines with proven efficacy was 
generated in study B7471007, in several steps:  
(1) Establishing non-inferiority to 13vPnC for the 13 shared serotypes in Cohort 1 (subjects ≥ 60 yoa),  
(2) Establishing non-inferiority to PPSV23 for the seven additional serotypes in Cohort 1 and  
(3) Establishing non-inferiority in a subset of cohort 1 (60-64 yoa) and younger subjects in Cohorts 2 
(50-59 yoa) and 3 (18-49 yoa), respectively.  
Non-inferior immune response is assumed if the lower bound of 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of OPA 
GMTs between the respective comparator arms is >0.5 [2-fold NI margin]. 
(1)  13 shared serotypes: The defined non-inferiority criteria were met for all 13 serotypes 
included in 20vPnC and 13vPnC. Nevertheless, lower immune response was observed for 11 
serotypes. The ratio of OPA GMTs between 20vPnC and 13vPnC was consistently around 0.8 
and the GMR 95%-CI did not include 1. In addition, the 95%-CI of the vaccine specific GMTs 
were non-overlapping between both vaccines for five serotypes and hardly overlapping for 
another five. Although meeting the non-inferiority criteria, these differences are noteworthy, 
especially since both vaccines are essentially the same product (with the additional serotypes 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 73/120 
 
  
 
 
 
for 20vPnC). The clinical relevance of this difference is unclear, especially since no correlate of 
protection exists. However, the protective effect for serotype 3 is unclear given the reduced 
response although the NI criterion was met. Although both vaccines 13vPnC and PPSV23 
contain serotype 3, it is still the most prevalent serotype causing IPD in Europe (14.7% of all 
reported IPD cases; ECDC “Invasive Pneumococcal Disease, Annual Epidemiological Report for 
2018”). Consequently, these findings have been reflected in the PI in order to provide relevant 
information to the prescriber. Further, the applicant outlined that the clinical relevance of 
these findings will be further investigated in the post-marketing setting to confirm 20vPnC 
effectiveness (see section on post-marketing below). 
(2)  7 additional serotypes: The defined non-inferiority criteria were met for six of the seven 
additional serotypes. The GMRs for these serotypes were clearly above 1, indicating higher 
immune response with 20vPnC compared to PPSV23. Only serotype 8 missed the non-
inferiority margin. The clinical relevance of this finding and the impact on vaccine efficacy and 
protection against serotype 8 is not known. The applicant argued that protection similar to the 
other serotypes could be assumed, based on only narrowly missing the criteria (GMR 0.55 
(0.49, 0.62)) and other immunogenicity endpoints in the range of other serotypes, but this is 
not endorsed. In Europe, serotype 8 is the most common serotype causing IPD in subjects 18-
65 yoa (approx. 22-32% of reported IPD cases) and after serotype 3 (14.7%) the second 
most common IPD causing serotype in adults ≥65 yoa (14.0%) (IPD Annual Epidemiological 
Report for 2018; ECDC). The additional benefit for six of the seven additional serotypes can be 
agreed upon. As regards serotype 8, while acknowledging the potential benefits of conjugate-
induced immunity by 20vPnC as opposed to PPSV23, the considerably reduced response to 
this serotype is of concern. The potential reasons for the pronounced difference observed for 
serotype 8 compared to the other six new serotypes are unknown. The clinical relevance of 
this finding will be further investigated to infer vaccine effectiveness against serotype 8 in the 
post-marketing (see section on post-marketing below). Breakthrough disease due to reduced 
vaccine effectiveness (or potential vaccine failure) as well as serotype replacement will be 
followed up via routine pharmacovigilance in the post marketing (see section on post-
marketing below).   
(3)  Bridge to younger cohorts: After establishing the initial immunological bridge to 13vPnC in 
cohort 1, a bridge to the younger cohorts should be established via demonstrating non-
inferiority of immune responses of all 20 serotypes elicited by 20vPnC in a subgroup of cohort 
1 (60-64 years) and Cohorts 2 and 3, respectively. The comparison of Cohort 2 (50-59 years) 
to Cohort 1 (60-64 years) showed GMT ratios around 1 for all serotypes, meeting the NI 
criteria. The comparison of Cohort 3 to Cohort 1 (60-64 years) showed overall ratios clearly 
above 1, except for serotype 3 (GMT ratio: 1.00), meeting all NI criteria.  
Although all endpoints were met, concerns about the intended bridge to younger cohorts 
remain. While this approach to compare the immune response across age groups has been 
accepted in the Scientific Advice, it was also specifically mentioned that the chosen margin 
does not allow any conclusions about whether the immune response between 20vPnC and 
13vPnC would be comparable. Further, it is known also from 13vPnC that higher immune 
responses are elicited in younger subjects, which was also stated by the applicant. Therefore, 
higher and consequently non-inferior immune response in younger subjects were to be 
expected. Information about the comparability of immune response between both vaccines can 
only be provided with comparative data between 20vPnC and 13vPnC in Cohorts 2 and 3. 
Although data for 13vPnC was collected, no pre-specified comparative analysis was performed 
by the applicant. The respective data has been compiled by the assessors and shows that 
immune response elicited by 20vPnC is consistently lower in all cohorts compared to 13vPnC. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 74/120 
 
  
 
 
These observations should be reflected in the SmPC. In Cohort 2, including 50-59-year-old 
subjects, the difference seems even more pronounced compared to Cohort 1, although the 
conclusions are somewhat hampered by the small number of subjects receiving 13vPnC. The 
observations of reduced response are further supported by overall reduced proportion of 
subjects with a ≥4-fold rise. The results raise doubts whether the approach to compare 
immune response between age groups instead of against the comparator vaccine directly is 
appropriate to establish an immunological bridge between a new vaccine and a vaccine with 
proven efficacy. Similar reductions have also been observed in other studies were respective 
data is available: the lot consistency study B7471008 and a paediatric study, submitted by the 
applicant (B7471003), although this population is not part of the current indication.  
Despite the concerns raised regarding the consistently lower immune response compared to 13vPnC in 
each cohort, it has to be acknowledged that almost all GMTs for 20vPnC in Cohorts 2 and 3 were 
higher than the GMTs observed for 13vPnC in subjects ≥60 yoa (cohort 1), which are assumed to 
provide protection against IPD and pneumonia. Consequently, a protective effect of 20vPnC for those 
two cohorts can be assumed. Nevertheless, the clinical relevance of the observed reduced immune 
response is currently unknown. Especially, it is not apparent whether the reduced GMTs observed in 
the most vulnerable age group, subjects ≥60 years, are still predictive for a (long-term) protective 
effect.  
Further, several populations exist in which a reduced immune response was already observed during 
the development of 13vPnC. These include amongst others primed subjects and subjects with risk 
factors, who have also been part of this development programme. For both populations reduced GMTs 
compared to pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects or subjects without risk factors have been observed 
(see below). It is not apparent whether the further reduced immune response to 20vPnC would elicit 
protective titres in these populations or at least in parts of these populations depending potentially on 
age or prior pneumococcal vaccine (see below). The need of another vaccination schedule (e.g. 
additional dose), especially for risk groups was not discussed by the applicant and so far, also no plans 
have been outlined how this could be investigated in the post-marketing (see section on post-
marketing below). 
Even if the observed titres would be representative for protection against IPD and pneumonia, it is not 
apparent how long this protection would last. It has to be assumed that the duration of the provided 
protection would also be reduced. Only limited data with 20vPnC for 12 months are available in about 
200 pneumococcal vaccine naïve adults 60-64 years of age from the Phase 2 study B7471002. The 
data can, however, not be compared to 13vPnC due to the applied dosing regimen and does not 
provide further information for the populations with reduced immune response. The applicant assumes 
that immune persistence for 20vPnC can be extrapolated from experience with 13vPnC since both are 
similar conjugate vaccines. Whether this is the case is, however, currently unclear considering the 
reduced immune response. No further discussion was provided to substantiate the claim of a protective 
effect similar to 13vPnC in adults ≥60 yoa, primed subjects and patients with decreased immune 
response. Therefore, upon request the applicant provided plans for the post-marketing to monitor 
breakthrough disease and potential other indications for lack of efficacy (see section on post-marketing 
below).  
Risk factors 
Adult subjects with risk factors for IPD regardless of age are an important target population for 
pneumococcal vaccines. Although such subjects were not explicitly recruited, about 1/3 of the enrolled 
subjects of the pivotal study had at least one risk factor. While such an analysis is considered 
important for this MAA, the initially performed analysis has several shortcomings: (1) The data analysis 
only compares subjects with risk factor to subjects without risk factor, regardless of type and amount 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 75/120 
 
  
 
 
of risk factors. (2) the presented analysis combined data from all three cohorts, which is not 
considered appropriate, since the GMTs differ substantially between cohorts. Upon request, the 
applicant provided respective analyses for each cohort.  
In general, the immune response in patients with risk factors was clearly detectable and supported by 
other parameters, e.g. a substantial proportion of subjects reached ≥4-fold GMT rise. However, the 
observed immune responses (OPA GMTs) were lower in subjects with risk factors compared to those 
without in all cohorts (GMT ratio ~ 0.6-0.8, ≥ 4-fold rise ~5-10% difference). The effect of reduced 
immune response is also known for 13vPnC. In the requested analyses, the applicant also compared 
the results between 20vPnC and the respective comparator, 13vPnC for all cohorts and PPSV23 in 
cohort 1. While the reduction observed between subjects with and without risk factors is similar 
between 20vPnC and 13vPnC, the reduced immune response of 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC seen in 
the naïve population of the pivotal study is also seen in this population. This further reduction of 
immune response raises concerns regarding a protective effect in patients with risk factors. The 
achieved titres in younger patients (cohort 2 and 3) with risk factors are comparable or above the 
titres achieved with 13vPnC in cohort 1, which are assumed to elicit a protective effect. However, 
whether the observed reduction in patients with risk factors of at least 60 years of age has clinical 
relevance, it is currently unknown. Since the initial titres are reduced, it is likely that the reduced titres 
also affect the long-term protection. The applicant was invited to further substantiate the claim, that 
these titres provide a protective effect, discuss respective implications on long term protection and 
present suitable post-marketing plans. Upon request, the applicant outlined how the clinical impact of 
these findings can be further investigated in the post-marketing in the general target population. 
However, some aspects of 20vPnC vaccine effectiveness are not especially addressed including 
(younger) subjects at risk for pneumococcal disease, primed subjects or immunocompromised 
patients. 
Consequently, it is currently still questioned whether data from 13vPnC can be extrapolated for 
patients at high risk for pneumococcal disease, e.g. immunocompromised subjects, which were not 
included in the development programme of 20vPnC. In order to provide supportive information to the 
prescriber, data derived with 13vPnC are included in the SmPC together with a clear statement that no 
data with 20vPnC are available and that lower titres have been observed. If vaccine effectiveness is 
shown in the respective post marketing studies, this will also be reassuring concerning those 
populations. 
The currently approved vaccines for the adult population in the EU include Prevenar13 (13vPnC) and 
Pneumovax23 (PPSV23, polysaccharide). Since the MAH of 13vPnC is also the applicant for 20vPnC, it 
is a reasonable assumption that 20vPnC is intended to replace 13vPnC in the applicant’s portfolio and 
will be removed from the European market, creating a lack of alternative conjugate vaccines. 
Consequently, remaining uncertainties about the protective effect especially in at-risk populations have 
to be further minimised (see section on post marketing below).  
Primed subjects 
The applicant performed Study B7471006 in adults ≥65 years of age (yoa) with prior pneumococcal 
vaccination separated in three different cohorts based on prior pneumococcal vaccinations. Overall, 
20vPnC elicited immune responses across all serotypes and cohorts but the immune responses differed 
considerably between the different cohorts. Overall, the data indicate that 20vPnC achieved higher 
immune responses after prior vaccination with the conjugate vaccine 13vPnC compared to prior 
vaccination with the unconjugated vaccine PPSV23, either alone or after prior vaccination with 13vPnC.  
It is not known, whether the elicited immune response in any of the cohorts is comparable to 13vPnC 
or PPSV23. The design of the study does not allow for such a comparison, which is regarded as 
shortcoming for this MAA. For cohort A and B, a safety control arm exists with subjects receiving either 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 76/120 
 
  
 
 
13vPnC (cohort A) or PPSV23 (cohort B) but no immunogenicity data exist for these arms. 
Alternatively, one general control arm with pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects would have been 
suitable to establish a bridge to the pivotal data from study B7471007. Since any kind of bridging is 
missing, it is not apparent whether an extrapolation of efficacy from 13vPnC and PPSV23 in primed 
subjects is possible. The applicant did not discuss this issue and argues instead that showing elicited 
immune response in primed subjects in general, is enough to conclude a protective effect. Although 
comparing results across studies is not optimal, the assessors compiled respective data to compare 
results derived in all three cohorts to the GMTs observed in cohort 1 from study B7471007 with a 
similar age group (≥60 yoa, pneumococcal naïve subjects). While similar immune response can be 
concluded for most serotypes between naïve subjects and subjects who received only 13vPnC, a 
reduced response has been observed in both cohorts including subjects who received PPSV23, 
especially as single vaccination. The applicant confirmed upon request that an effect to a similar 
degree was also observed with 13vPnC. However, the clinical relevance of this observation in unknown. 
While it is assumed that the apparent reduced immunity with 20vPnC in subjects previously vaccinated 
with PPSV23 could be induced by a hypo-response phenomenon, this has not been scientifically proven 
yet. In addition, the applicant clarified that the role of the interval between the last dose of PPSV23 (in 
Cohort A and C) and 20vPnC cannot be evaluated since respective data was not collected in the study. 
No data about a potential booster vaccination have been submitted. The applicant argues that 
persistence of immune response can be extrapolated from 13vPnC based on the established 
immunological bridge and nature of the pneumococcal conjugate response. While this might be 
possible for the 13 shared serotypes, given a robust immunological bridge, an extrapolation for the 
seven additional serotypes from 13vPnC is not possible. Although the pivotal study intends to establish 
an immunological bridge to PPSV23 for these serotypes, extrapolation of immune persistence is 
questionable. The comparator PPSV23 is an unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine with known limited 
persistence. Supportive long-term data up to one year is generated in the phase 2 study (B7471002) 
as exploratory endpoint. For this time-point, control data of a sequential vaccination with 13vPnC 
followed one month later by PPSV23 are available. Data from 12 months after the first vaccination 
indicate that OPA GMTs declined similarly over time for both vaccination regimen and OPA titres 
remained above baseline levels. This allows for a comparison of the immune response between 20vPnC 
and PPSV23 against the seven additional (non-13vPnC) serotypes but only between 12 months data for 
20vPnC and 11 months data for PPSV23. Nevertheless, the additional data are considered informative 
for the assessment of immune persistence of these seven serotypes. Unfortunately, no direct 
comparison between 20vPnC and 13vPnC is possible to confirm the extrapolated information for the 13 
shared serotypes. The applicant does not intend to conduct a post-marketing study to assess the need 
for booster vaccination in adults and presented data from a study evaluating multiple doses of 13vPnC 
in HIV infected patients, showing moderately increased titres after 3 doses. Since it is currently not 
known whether the observed reduction in OPA GMTs for 20vPnC would result in a reduced protection or 
whether similar results would be obtained with 20vPnC for multiple doses as presented for 13vPnC and 
whether the gained increase would improve the protective effect, it is agreed that it is currently not 
necessary to perform respective multiple dose studies with 20vPnC. This, however, might change, if 
appropriate post-marketing studies would detect a reduced protection with 20vPnC. 
Lot-to-lot consistency (Study B7471008): The pre-defined equivalence criteria were met for all 
serotypes for all three 20vPnC lots. Each of the pairwise 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
geometric mean ratio (GMR) of OPA titres 1 month after vaccination were contained in the interval 
(0.5, 2.0). Although the clinical relevance of the defined margins is not established, it is acknowledged 
that all CI included 1. Lot-to-lot consistency studies are not routinely required based on the EMA 
guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines.  
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 77/120 
 
  
 
 
No data on concomitant vaccination with other vaccines relevant to the target population (e.g. 
Influenza vaccines) are currently available. A respective trial evaluating 20vPnC co-administered with 
seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine is currently ongoing (variation intended for post marketing). 
Post-marketing assessments to monitor vaccine effectiveness: 
The applicant provided an outline of their post-marketing plans to assess effectiveness of 20vPnC. 
These are considered important to address the remaining uncertainties regarding the lower titres 
induced by 20vPnC vaccination compared to 13vPnC and the considerable low titre against serotype 8 
(compared to PPSV23). The applicant’s plans are as follows: 
1.  A vaccine effectiveness study against vaccine-type community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)  
As a post-marketing requirement with the US FDA (condition of accelerated approval), the applicant 
will conduct a vaccine effectiveness (VE) study against vaccine-type (VT) community-acquired 
pneumonia (CAP) in the USA (B7471015) in adults ≥65 years of age. 20vPnC VE against all 20 
serotypes, VE against the 13vPnC matched and 7 additional serotypes (including serotype 8) will be 
evaluated employing a test-negative design. Study results are expected by 30 November 2027. The 
study protocol has been provided with the applicant’s response. As serotype distribution differs across 
continents, the applicant is expected to provide a detailed discussion on the applicability of study 
results to the European situation together with the study results. With test-negative design, the study 
will also include subjects with risk factors as well as subjects with pneumococcal vaccination history 
(≥65 years of age) and has the potential to also provide further information on VE (against CAP) in this 
population. However, no additional data on subjects at higher risk for pneumococcal disease and/or 
generally lower immune response to pneumococcal vaccination (e.g. with prior PPSV23 vaccination) 
< 65 years of age will be generated.  
As this study is considered relevant to further address remaining uncertainties, it is added as a post-
authorisation obligation (see Product information- Annex II D and Risk Management Plan [RMP]). 
2.  Two Phase 4 Observational, Real-World Studies of 20vPnC Effectiveness. One against VT CAP in 
Europe and one against VT IPD in Europe  
Two additional studies to evaluate the impact of 20vPnC vaccination on vaccine type (VT) CAP and IPD 
in Europe (are currently undergoing feasibility evaluation. The applicant is expected to further 
investigate VE in these populations as part of the post-marketing assessment. 
Completion of the feasibility assessment is ongoing, with submission of both protocols in likelihood by 
end Q1 2024 (date added to RMP). Since the data generated in these studies will be important for the 
future assessment of the remaining uncertainties, the commitment is included as post-authorisation 
measure in Annex II D. Tentative timeline for CSRs submission has been set. 
3.  Monitoring of Pneumococcal Serotype Epidemiology and Vaccine Failures in Europe 
Ultimately, European national IPD surveillance systems as well as the ECDC European IPD surveillance 
system will be employed to monitor serotype epidemiology and breakthrough infections. Annual 
reports will be submitted. This is considered part of the routine pharmacovigilance measures and 
therefore expected regardless of other post marketing studies.  
Taken together, the presented post-marketing plans are expected to provide valuable information on 
20vPnC effectiveness, and the remaining uncertainties related to the clinical impact of reduced immune 
responses elicited by 20vPnC compared to the majority of serotypes shared with 13vPnC and serotype 
8 shared with PPSV23. However, some aspects of 20vPnC vaccine effectiveness are not especially 
addressed including (younger) subjects at risk for pneumococcal disease, primed subjects or 
immunocompromised patients. Nevertheless, if vaccine effectiveness is shown in the respective 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 78/120 
 
  
 
 
studies, this will also be reassuring concerning those populations (Post-authorisation measures stated 
in Annex II D and RMP). 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the results indicate that 20vPnC was immunogenic in all subgroups tested. However, several 
uncertainties were identified concerning numerically lower immune response compared to 13vPnC (for 
most shared serotypes) and compared to PPSV23 (for serotype 8). The SmPC appropriately reflects 
these findings. The applicant will further address these findings in the post-marketing setting and 
evaluate their impact on 20vPnC effectiveness. The RMP and SmPC Annex II were updated accordingly 
to include the respective post-marketing commitments. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
a. In order to further investigate the long-term effectiveness of Apexxnar for active immunisation for 
the prevention of pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the MAH should conduct and 
submit the results of US study B7471015, a Phase 4 study using a test-negative design to evaluate the 
effectiveness of Apexxnar against Vaccine-Type Community-Acquired Pneumonia in adults ≥ 65 years 
of age. 
b. In order to further investigate the long-term effectiveness of Apexxnar for active immunisation for 
the prevention of pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the MAH should conduct and 
submit the results of a Phase 4 Observational, real-world study to evaluate the effectiveness of 
Apexxnar against Vaccine-Type Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Europe according to an agreed 
protocol.   
c. In order to further investigate the long-term effectiveness of Apexxnar for active immunisation for 
the prevention of invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the MAH should conduct and 
submit the results of a Phase 4 Observational, real-world study to evaluate the effectiveness of 
Apexxnar against Vaccine-Type Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in Europe according to an agreed 
protocol.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The 20vPnC adult clinical development programme was designed to characterize the safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of 20vPnC in adults ≥18 years of age. The adult clinical development 
programme for 20vPnC is generally modelled after the 13vPnC adult programme and takes into 
consideration the favourable safety profile established for 13vPnC in the adult clinical development 
programme and the adult post-marketing experience since initial licensure in 2011.  
The safety of 20vPnC was assessed in three early stage (two Phase 1 trials and one Phase 2 trial) and 
three Phase 3 clinical trials. Early phase trials enrolled adults who were naïve to pneumococcal vaccine 
18 through 49 years of age (B7471001 and B7471005) and 60 through 64 years of age (B7471002). 
The Phase 3 safety data are summarised and discussed separately for individuals who were naïve to 
pneumococcal vaccine at trial enrolment (B7471007 and B7471008) and for individuals ≥65 years of 
age who had previously been vaccinated with 13vPnC, PPSV23, or both (B7471006). In all three Phase 
3 trials, the safety of 20vPnC was mainly evaluated in comparison to 13vPnC. 
Data pooling: 
Each Phase 3 trial has distinct study objectives and design, including different subject populations with 
regard to age and prior pneumococcal vaccination status. The only overlapping subject populations 
across studies are pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects 18-49 years of age from B7471007 Cohort 3 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 79/120 
 
  
 
 
and B7471008. Age and prior pneumococcal vaccination status are important factors when interpreting 
safety and tolerability results. As these factors differ by study, safety data are presented mainly by 
study in side-by-side displays, except that data are pooled for subjects 18-49 years of age 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The 6 studies contributing to the evaluation of safety enrolled 7048 adult subjects. In total, 4552 
subjects received 20vPnC and 2496 received control vaccine. The extent of exposure in the different 
studies is presented in Table 38. 20vPnC is given as a single IM dose. 
Table 36: Number (%) of Subjects who Received at Least 1 Study Vaccination in all Adult 
Clinical Studies 
Because adults ≥65 years of age are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, this is the population 
most often targeted by national recommendations for adult pneumococcal vaccination. For this reason, 
safety data are summarised separately for this age group, including both pneumococcal vaccine naïve 
subjects (in B7471007) and subjects with prior pneumococcal vaccination (in B7471006). The Phase 3 
studies enrolled 1885 subjects ≥65 years of age; among these, 1138 received 20vPnC and 747 
received control vaccine (Table 37).

Across the three Phase 3 trials, subjects were predominantly female (52.0% to 65.9% across groups 
defined by age and prior pneumococcal vaccination status within the 20vPnC and control vaccine 
groups). With regard to age, 59.8% of subjects were ≥60 years of age, 6.9% were 50 through 59 
years of age, and 33.3% were 18 through 49 years of age. The Phase 3 trials were conducted in the 
United States and Sweden; subjects in Sweden were enrolled in B7471007 (Cohort 1 only) and 
B7471006 (Cohort A only). Overall, the safety populations in B7471007 and B7471008 reflected a 
diverse racial and ethnic distribution (80.7% white, 14.2% black, 2.1% Asian; and 10.3% Hispanic). 
In B7471006, subjects were predominantly white (92.4%). Entrance criteria for this study required 
that subjects had previously received pneumococcal vaccination, which may have affected the racial 
distribution. In addition, approximately 15% of subjects in the study were enrolled at sites in Sweden. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Data collection and analysis strategy 
The methods for safety data collection and analysis were the same in all three Phase 3 trials.  
Immediate reactions within the first 30 minutes after vaccination were assessed and documented as an 
AE or SAE, as appropriate, in the case report form (CRF).  
Postvaccination safety evaluations were reported by the subject in an electronic diary as follows: 
• 
Specific reactions and events and use of antipyretic or pain medications were reported by subjects 
in response to specific prompts using an electronic diary (e-diary): 
o 
local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) occurring within 10 days 
after vaccination 
o  systemic events (fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain) occurring within 7 
days after vaccination 
o  use of antipyretic or pain medications within 7 days after vaccination 
• 
• 
• 
AEs occurring within 1 month after vaccination 
SAEs occurring within 6 months after vaccination 
NDCMCs occurring within 6 months after vaccination

Immediate adverse events 
After each vaccination, subjects were observed for at least 30 minutes by site staff, who recorded AEs 
occurring during that time. 
The proportion of subjects who reported immediate AEs after vaccination was low, both among 
subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccine (≤0.2% after 20vPnC; ≤0.9% after 13vPnC) and among 
subjects ≥65 years of age by prior pneumococcal vaccination status (≤0.4% after 20vPnC; ≤0.8% 
after control vaccines).

Solicited adverse events 
Subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccine (B7471007 and B7471008) 
Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Across age groups and in both vaccine groups, 
the most frequently reported local reaction was pain at the injection site (55% to 79% after 20vPnC; 
54% to 78% after 13vPnC), with a trend toward decreasing frequency with increasing age. Other local 
reactions were reported at lower frequencies (redness: 7.3% to 8.2% after 20vPnC, 5.4% to 7.3% 
after 13vPnC, and swelling: 7.5% to 9.1% after 20vPnC, 8.0% to 10.8% after 13vPnC). Across age 
groups and after either 20vPnC or 13vPnC, the median onset day for local reactions was generally 
between Day 1 to Day 2.5 and reactions generally resolved with a median duration between 1 to 2 
days.

groups, the most frequently reported systemic event was muscle pain (39% to 63% after 20vPnC; 
37% to 65% after 13vPnC). Across the age groups, the frequency of most systemic events tended to 
decrease with increasing age. Fever ≥38°C was reported at low frequency (0.9% to 1.5% after 
20vPnC; 0.8% to 1.1% after 13vPnC). 
Across age groups and after either 20vPnC or 13vPnC, the median onset day for most systemic events 
was generally between Day 1 to Day 2, and systemic events generally resolved with a median duration 
of 1 to 2 days.

Subjects ≥65 years of age by prior pneumococcal vaccination status (B7471006 and B7471007)  
Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In all groups defined by prior pneumococcal 
vaccination status and after both 20vPnC and control vaccines, the most frequently reported local 
reaction was pain at the injection site (44% to 61% after 20vPnC; 43% to 56% after control vaccines). 
Other local reactions were reported at much lower frequencies (redness: 4.8% to 8.6% after 20vPnC; 
2.5% to 13% after control vaccines; swelling: 4.0% to 9.9% after 20vPnC; 6.6% to 14% after control 
vaccines). In B7471006, after either 20vPnC or control vaccine, and across the cohorts, the median 
onset day for local reactions was Day 1 or Day 2, and reactions generally resolved with a median 
duration of 1 to 2 days.

Population  
Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. In all groups defined by prior pneumococcal 
vaccination status and after both 20vPnC and control vaccines, the most frequently reported type of 
systemic event was muscle pain (32% to 38% after 20vPnC; 31% to 46% after control vaccines). 
Fever ≥38°C was reported at low frequency (0.0% to 1.2% after 20vPnC; 0.0% to 1.6% after control 
vaccines). In B7471006, in the 20vPnC and control vaccine groups, the median onset day for each type 
of systemic event was between Day 1 and Day 3.5. Systemic events generally resolved with a median 
duration of 1 to 2 days.

B7471001 
Local reactions were reported by a similar proportion of subjects in the 20vPnC group and Tdap group 
with the majority being either mild or moderate in severity. One subject who was in the 20vPnC group 
reported severe pain at the injection site and severe limitation of arm movement. The most commonly 
reported local reaction in the 20vPnC and Tdap group was pain at the injection site (69.7% and 63.6%, 
respectively), followed by limitation of arm movement (36.4% and 18.2%, respectively). Redness and 
swelling were reported by 1 (3.0%) subject each in the 20vPnC group, and by no subjects in the Tdap 
group.

Systemic events were reported by a higher proportion of subjects in the 20vPnC group (72.7%) 
compared to the Tdap group (57.6%). The majority of systemic events were mild or moderate in 
severity. The most commonly reported systemic event in the 20vPnC and Tdap groups was new muscle 
pain (45.5% and 42.4%, respectively), followed by fatigue and headache (each reported by 39.4% and 
30.3% of subjects in the 20vPnC and Tdap group, respectively). Fever was reported by 1 (3.0%) 
subject each in the 20vPnC group. One (1) subject who received 20vPnC reported a severe headache 
on Day 3 after vaccination and 1 subject who received Tdap report severe fatigue on Day 7 after 
vaccination. 
A total of 21.2% of subjects in the 20vPnC group and 18.2% of subjects in the Tdap group reported 
the use of antipyretic or pain medication. The median day of onset for the use of medication to treat 
pain/fever was similar between subjects who received 20vPnC (Day 3) and Tdap (Day 4). 
B7471002 
The proportions of participants who reported prompted local reactions within 10 days after vaccination 
with 20vPnC or 13vPnC by maximum severity were similar in the 2 groups (60.9% in the 
20vPnC/Saline group and 56.8 in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group). The most frequent local reaction 
reported was pain at injection site, and most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. 
Redness was observed slightly more often in 20vPnC higher (11.4%) compared to control (6.8%). 
The proportions and maximum severity of prompted systemic events reported within 7 days after 
Vaccination 1 were similar for the 2 groups (54.5% in the 20vPnC/Saline group and 55.9% in the 
13vPnC/PPSV23 group). The most frequent systemic event reported was muscle pain, and most 
systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Muscle pain was slightly higher in 20vPnC (43.2%) 
compared to control vaccine group (36.5%). 
B7471005 
The proportions of participants who reported prompted local reactions within 14 days after vaccination 
by maximum severity in the 20vPnC and c7vPnC groups were similar to the 13vPnC group. The most 
frequent local reaction reported was pain at injection site (77.1% in the 20vPnC group; 76.5% in the 
20vPnC group; 79.4% in the 13vPnC group). Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. 
Swelling was reported by 2 subjects in each arm (<6%). Redness was reported by 2 subjects in 
20vPnC and c7vPnC groups, whereas no events of redness were reported in 13vPnC group. The 
majority of local reactions had a median day of onset of between 1 to 3 days after vaccination. The 
majority of local reactions generally resolved with median durations between 1 to 3 days. 
The proportions and maximum severity of prompted systemic events reported within 14 days after 
vaccination in the 20vPnC and c7vPnC groups were mostly similar to the 13vPnC group, except that a 
higher number of participants reported headache (mostly mild) in the 20vPnC group (13 out of 35 
[37.1%] participants) compared to the c7vPnC group (8 out of 34 [23.5%] participants) and 13vPnC 
group (5 out of 34 [14.7%] participants). The most frequent systemic event reported was muscle pain 
(57.1% in the 20vPnC group; 35.3% in the c7vPnC group; 52.9% in the 13vPnC group). Most systemic 
events were mild or moderate in severity. The majority of systemic events had a median day of onset 
of between 1 to 2.5 days after vaccination, with the exception of headache (5 days in the 20vPnC 
groups, 7 days in the 13vPnC group) , and generally resolved with median durations between 1 to 4 
days. 
Unsolicited adverse events 
Subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccine (B7471007 and B7471008) 
Only AEs (MedDRA Preferred Terms) reported for more than 1% of subjects in either vaccine group 
within each age group are presented here (Table 44). 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 88/120 
 
  
 
 
 
The proportions of subjects reporting any AE within 1 month after vaccination were similar across age 
groups and were similar for subjects who received 20vPnC (8.4% to 10%) and 13vPnC (7.3% to 11%). 
Overall, the AEs reported were generally diseases and conditions often observed in adults in these age 
groups. The most frequently reported AEs were in the Infections and Infestations SOC (3.1% to 5.1% 
after 20vPnC; 3.2% to 5.4% after 13vPnC). Few AEs (MedDRA Preferred Terms) were reported for 
more than 1% of subjects in either vaccine group within each age group.

Group –Safety Population  
Subjects ≥65 years of age by prior pneumococcal vaccination status (B7471006 and B7471007)  
The proportions of subjects reporting any AE within 1 month after vaccination were similar for subjects 
who received 20vPnC (4.9% to 10%) or control vaccines (9.0% to 12%). Overall, the AEs reported 
were generally the types of diseases and conditions often observed in adults ≥65 years of age. The 
most frequently reported AEs were in the Infections and Infestations SOC (1.2% to 3.2% after 
20vPnC; 1.6% to 4.9% after control vaccines). Few AEs (MedDRA Preferred Terms) were reported for 
more than 1% of subjects in any vaccine group.

Supplementary data from phase 1/2 studies B7471001, B7471002 and B7471005 
B7471001: In the 20vPnC and the Tdap vaccine groups, 15 (45.5%) and 11 (33.3%) subjects reported 
AEs within 1 month after vaccination. The most frequently reported AEs in both the 20vPnC and Tdap 
groups were in the gastrointestinal disorders SOC (15.2% and 9.1% of subjects, respectively). The 
most frequently reported AEs in the 20vPnC group (reported by more than 1 subject) were dyspepsia, 
viral upper respiratory tract infection, headache, insomnia and dysmenorrhea (2 [6.1%] subjects 
each). All other AEs in both the 20vPnC and Tdap groups were reported in single subjects. 
B7471002: At 1 month after Vaccination 1, the proportions of participants reporting any AEs were 
similar in the 2 groups (12.2% in the 20vPnC/Saline group and 13.1% in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group). 
From Vaccination 2 to 1 month after Vaccination 2, the proportions of participants reporting any AEs 
were higher in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group than in 20vPnC/saline group, particularly in system organ 
class (SOC) of general disorders and administration site conditions, which may be expected as one 
group received saline while the other received PPSV23 (7% in the 20vPnC/Saline group and 18.7 % in 
the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group). One month after participants received each vaccination, infections and 
infestations were the most frequently reported types of AEs by SOC in both groups. The most 
frequently reported AEs by preferred term within 1 month after each vaccination was upper respiratory 
tract infection in both groups, whereas injection site pain, and injection site swelling were also 
frequently reported in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group 1 month after Vaccination 2. 
B7471005: At 1 month after vaccination, the proportions of participants reporting any AEs were similar 
in the vaccine groups i.e. 2/35 (5.7%) in the 20vPnC group versus 3/34 (8.8%), with no more than 3 
participants from each vaccine group reporting any AEs. No PT was reported in more than 1 
participant. The most frequently reported AEs.  
Related adverse events 
Subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccine (B7471007 and B7471008) 
The proportions of subjects reporting any AE occurring within 1 month after vaccination and considered 
by the investigator to be related to study vaccine were low and were similar after 20vPnC (≤0.9%) or 
13vPnC (≤1.5%) and across age groups (Table 46). The most frequently reported types of AEs 
considered by the investigator to be related to study vaccine were injection site reactions in the SOC of 
general disorders and administration site conditions. 
Subjects ≥65 years of age by prior pneumococcal vaccination status (B7471006 and B7471007)  
AEs considered related to study vaccine were reported for ≤1.6% of subjects after 20vPnC and for 
≤2.4% after control vaccines (Table 47).

Population  
Supplementary data from phase 1/2 studies B7471001, B7471002 and B7471005 
B7471001  
Within 1 month of vaccination there were 2 (6.1%) subjects each in the 20vPnC and Tdap groups who 
reported related AEs. Two (2) subjects in the 20vPnC group reported a total of 2 events and 2 subjects 
in the Tdap group reported a total of 4 events. No subjects reported related AEs after 1 month post-
vaccination. Onset of related events ranged from the day of vaccination (Day 1) to 9 days after 
vaccination and the duration ranged from 1 to 31 days. Related AEs were reported by two subjects 
(decreased appetite [1] and limb discomfort [1]) in the 20vPnC group and by two subjects (limb 
discomfort [1] and photophobia, nausea, and dizziness [1]) in the Tdap group. 
B7471002  
Few participants reported AEs that were considered related to vaccination after receiving Vaccination 1 
to 1 month after vaccination and after receiving Vaccination 2 to 1 month after vaccination in the 2

groups. The most frequent related AEs reported were in the SOC of general disorders and 
administration site conditions. 
B7471005  
Of the few AEs reported in the study, only 2 participants reported AEs that were considered related to 
vaccination. Following AEs were considered vaccine-related AEs: injection site erythema and swelling in 
the 20vPnC group; fatigue, vomiting and headache in the c7vPnC group. In the 13vPnC group no AE 
was considered as vaccine related.  
Severe adverse events 
The proportion of subjects who reported severe AEs after vaccination was low, both among subjects 
naïve to pneumococcal vaccine (≤0.8% after 20vPnC; ≤1.1% after 13vPnC) and among subjects ≥65 
years of age by prior pneumococcal vaccination status (≤1.6% after 20vPnC; ≤2.4% after control 
vaccines).   
Other Significant AEs/ Newly diagnosed medical conditions 
The proportions of subjects reporting NDCMCs within 6 months after vaccination was low, both among 
subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccine (≤2.3% after both 20vPnC and 13vPnC) and among subjects 
≥65 years of age by prior pneumococcal vaccination status (≤4.0% after 20vPnC; ≤2.4% after control 
vaccines). The most frequently reported NDCMCs were in the SOCs of Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders, Metabolism and nutrition disorders (predominantly Type 2 diabetes mellitus), and 
Vascular disorders (predominantly hypertension). Overall, the NDCMCs reported were generally 
diseases and conditions often observed in adults in these age groups.  
Of note that as of the cut-off date, two cases of autoimmune disorders (Basedow’s disease [1] and 
rheumatoid arthritis [1]) were reported after 20nPvC. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths 
Subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccine (B7471007 and B7471008) 
The proportions of subjects reporting one or more SAEs within 6 months after vaccination were low 
and similar after 20vPnC (≤2.4%) or 13vPnC (≤1.9%). SAEs were reported at a slightly higher 
frequency among subjects ≥60 years of age (2.4% after 20vPnC, 1.9% after 13vPnC) than in younger 
age groups (≤0.9% after either vaccine). None of the SAEs reported were considered by the 
investigator to be related to study vaccine. The most frequently reported SAEs were in the Infections 
and infestations SOC. (Table 48).

and similar after 20vPnC (≤3.7% in naïve and 2.4% in previously vaccinated) or control vaccine 
(≤2.8% in naïve or 1.6% in previously vaccinated). None of the SAEs reported were considered related 
to study vaccine by the investigator (Table 49).

Supplementary data from phase 1/2 studies B7471001, B7471002 and B7471005 
B7471001: Two subjects (6.1%) who received 20vPnC reported SAEs from the visit 1 month after 
vaccination through the 6-month follow-up visit. One subject, who received 20vPnC, reported a SAE of 
loss of consciousness caused by exposure to carbon monoxide 30 days after vaccination. Another 
subject, who also received 20vPnC, reported a SAE of back pain 83 days after vaccination. None of the 
reported SAEs were considered related to vaccine. 
B7471002: Few participants reported SAEs at 1 month after each vaccination. The majority of SAEs 
occurred 1 month after Vaccination 2 (5 events in the 20vPnC/saline group and 4 events in the 
13vPnC/PPSV23 group). No SAEs reported were considered related to vaccine.

B7471005: No participants reported SAEs during the study. 
Deaths 
In B7471007 Cohort 1, a 60-year-old male who was naive to pneumococcal vaccine and received 
20vPnC/saline, died 48 days after receiving Vaccination 2. The investigator considered the death not 
related to study vaccine. 
In study B7471001, one subject died during the study due to a motor vehicle accident 75 days after 
vaccination. The cause of death was determined not to be related to the study vaccine by the 
investigator.  
In B7471005, B7471006 and B7471008 no participants died during the studies. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations were not performed systematically in any of the Phase 3 trials. Any 
clinical laboratory values of concern that came to the attention of the investigator were to be reported 
as AEs. 
Supplementary data from phase 1 study B7471001 
Standard laboratory testing for cardiac function, haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis were 
performed. Serial cardiac enzyme (cardiac troponin I) levels were assessed as a response to nonclinical 
observations of microscopic inflammation with degeneration/necrosis of cardiac myocytes or 
myocardial fibrosis in a small number of rabbits in the repeat-dose toxicity study. Nonclinical 
investigations supported that the rabbit cardiac findings were likely related to toxicity study procedures 
and handling, not directly related to 20vPnC, and unlikely to have any translational relevance to 
humans. No elevations in troponin I were observed, and no other cardiovascular concerns were 
identified in the Phase 1 trial. No cardiovascular signals have been identified in the Phase 2 and 3 
trials. No other lab values were clinically significant. There were no clinically significant ECG results and 
no clinically significant ECG findings in the isolated number of subjects with ECGs conducted after 
vaccination for events of interest. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Sex, Race and Age 
Within each Phase 3 trial, as appropriate based on population size and composition, the proportions of 
subjects with local reactions, systemic events, and AEs were summarised by sex (all 3 studies), race 
(B7471007 and B7471008 only), and age (B7471007 only).  
Local Reactions: Within each of the sex, race, and age subgroups, the proportions of subjects reporting 
local reactions were similar after 20vPnC or control vaccine. There were trends toward a higher 
frequency of local reactions among females than among males in both vaccine groups, although this 
varied by study. In B7471007, the frequency of pain at the injection site decreased with increasing age 
across the age cohorts (see Section 2.7.4.2.1.1) and across age subgroups (60-64 years, 65-69 years, 
70-79 years, and ≥80 years).  
Systemic Events: Within each of the sex, race, and age subgroups, the proportions of subjects 
reporting systemic events were similar after 20vPnC or control vaccine. There were trends toward a 
higher frequency of systemic events among females than among males. In B7471007, the frequency of 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 99/120 
 
 
 
  
systemic events decreased with increasing age across the age cohorts (see Section 2.7.4.2.1.2) and 
across age subgroups (60-64 years, 65-69 years, 70-79 years, and ≥80 years).  
Adverse Events: Within each Phase 3 trial, as appropriate, AEs reported by ≥4 subjects in at least 1 
vaccine group were summarised by sex, race, and age. In B7471007 and B7471008, within each of the 
sex, race, and age subgroups, the proportions of subjects reporting at least 1 AE were similar after 
20vPnC or control vaccine. AEs were not summarised by sex for B7471006 because no AEs were 
reported for ≥4 subjects in that study. Overall, there were no consistent trends in the frequency of AEs 
by sex, race, or age.  
Individuals at increased risk for pneumococcal disease 
20vPnC had an acceptable safety profile in the B7471007 safety population, approximately 34% of 
whom were adults ≥18 years of age with risk factors that placed them at increased risk for serious 
pneumococcal disease, including smoking (13%), and medical conditions of chronic cardiovascular 
disease (5.5%), chronic pulmonary disease including asthma (8.7%), chronic liver disease (0.4%), and 
diabetes mellitus (14%). 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Women who were pregnant or lactating were not eligible for studies of 20vPnC. In total eight women 
became pregnant during participation in the Phase 3 trials; seven subjects who received 20vPnC and 1 
subject who received 13vPnC in B7471007 and B7471008. These pregnancies were not associated with 
AEs but were communicated to the sponsor on an SAE form and AE case report form per sponsor 
guidance, and are included in the AE listings within each CSR.  
Among the 7 subjects with reported events of pregnancy who had received 20vPnC, 6 events had an 
outcome of full-term live birth and 1 event had an unknown outcome. The subject who had received 
13vPnC (in Study B7471008) reported being in a motor vehicle accident 187 days after vaccination and 
reported a spontaneous abortion 9 days later. This event occurred outside the safety reporting window 
and therefore was not included in the AE listing in the CSR. The investigator considered there was not 
a reasonable possibility that this event was related to study vaccine. The event was more likely 
triggered by the motor vehicle accident and associated with a foetal genetic anomaly (post-foetal 
demise test results showed “likely trisomy 21”). Further details about the events of pregnancy can be 
found in the CSRs (Module 5.3.5.1 B7471007 Report Body Section 12.5.5; Module 5.3.5.1 B7471008 
Report Body Section 12.5.5). 
It is not known whether 20vPnC is excreted in human milk. No vaccine-related effects on female 
fertility or the development of foetuses or offspring were observed in a fertility and developmental 
toxicity study of 20vPnC in rabbits (Module 4.2.3.5.1 20168231 [18GR287]). 
Vaccination 2 in the Cohort 1 in the Study B7471007 (20vPnC/Saline vs. 13vPnC/PPSV23) 
In B7471007, subjects in Cohort 1 received 2 vaccinations. At Vaccination 1, each subject received 
either 20vPnC or 13vPnC (control vaccine). Subjects in Cohort 1 who received 20vPnC at Vaccination 
1, received saline at Vaccination 2. Subjects in Cohort 1 who received 13vPnC at Vaccination 1, 
received PPSV23 at Vaccination 2. Vaccination 2 took place 28-42 days after Vaccination 1.   
Serious AEs as well as n diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMC) reported from vaccination 2 to 
1 month after vaccination 2 in Cohort 1 are already included in the tables presenting Serious AEs and 
NDCMC reported within 6 months from Vaccination 1 and thus not repeated here. 
In Cohort 1, immediate AEs reported after vaccination 2 (saline or PPSV23) were low in frequency 
(<1%) for the 20vPnC/saline and 13vPnC/PPSV23 groups. Fewer immediate AEs were reported in the 
20vPnC/saline group (0.1%) than in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group (0.6%). Observed AEs were local 
EMA/12384/2022

reactions, pain in extremity, dizziness and headache. In the 20vPnC arm, no PT was reported in more 
than 1 participant.  
The proportion of participants with AEs related to study was lower in the 20vPnC/saline group (0.4%) 
than in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group (6.4%). In the 20vPnC/saline group AEs that were considered to be 
related to the vaccine were diarrhoea, injection site erythema, pyrexia, bronchitis, headache and rash. 
No PT was reported in more than 1 participant in the 20vPnC/saline group. 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity represents the PD effect of the vaccine and represents the main evidence for this 
application. Results are described and assessed in section 3. 
Among pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects, two cases of hypersensitivity considered unrelated to the 
study vaccine were reported. 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interactions were investigated, and no data are available regarding concomitant use of 
20vPnC with other vaccines in adults. A safety and immunogenicity trial of 20vPnC co-administered 
with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in adults ≥65 years of age is currently ongoing. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation from the study were reported only for subjects in B7471007, Cohort 1 
(subjects ≥60 years of age); these included 12 subjects (0.8%) who received 20vPnC and 8 (0.5%) 
who received 13vPnC. All of these subjects were withdrawn from the study after Vaccination 1 (20vPnC 
or 13vPnC) and before Vaccination 2 (saline or PPSV23), except for the subject in the 20vPnC/saline 
group who died (after Vaccination 2). The AEs leading to withdrawal were considered related to study 
vaccine for 5 of the subjects who received 20vPnC and 4 of the subjects who received 13vPnC; most of 
these AEs were injection site reactions.  
Reasons for discontinuation in the 20vPnC arm considered to be related to the study vaccine were 
palpitations and anxiety (moderate/moderate); vaccination site pruritus and vaccination site swelling 
(moderate/moderate); feeling abnormal and pruritus (mild/moderate); swelling (severe); erythema 
(severe). Reasons for discontinuation which were considered not related to the study vaccine by the 
investigator were completed suicide, angioedema (due to concomitant medication, mild), presyncope, 
atopic dermatitis (pre-existing condition), hypersensitivity (seasonal allergens), coronary artery 
disease (cardiac disease), and arthritis (worsening of pre-existing condition). 
Reasons for discontinuation in the 20vPnC arm considered to be related to the study vaccine were 
injection site pain and myalgia (mild/mild); headache (moderate), injection site reaction (mild), 
bronchial hyperreactivity (severe). Reasons for discontinuation which were considered not related to 
the study vaccine by the investigator were cystitis (primary cystitis), lower respiratory tract infection 
(community exposure); muscle rupture (old injury) and COPD (exacerbation). 
A listing of AEs leading to discontinuation is available in Module 5.3.5.1 B7471007 Appendix 
16.2.7.9.1. 
No withdrawals due to AEs were reported in the other cohorts in B7471007 (18-49 and 50-59 years of 
age), nor in B7471006 or B7471008. 
There were no withdrawals due to AEs in phase 1/2 studies B7471001, B7471002 or B7471005.

2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available as 20vPnC has not been marketed for adults in any country. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of 20vPnC was evaluated in 6 clinical trials in adults ≥18 years of age. The three 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials evaluated 20vPnC administered to adults 18 through 49 years of age 
(B7471001 and B7471005) and 60 through 64 years of age (B7471002). The Phase 3 trials included 
pneumococcal vaccine naïve adults≥18 years of age (B7471007 and B7471008) and adults ≥65 years 
previously vaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine (B7471006). Age and prior pneumococcal 
vaccination status were considered as important factors resulting in a pooled analysis from 
pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects 18-49 years of age from B7471007 Cohort 3 and B7471008. 
Safety data from other subjects were displayed side-by-side.  
Methods to assess the reactogenicity and safety of 20vPnC are in principle considered appropriate. 
Local solicited reactions including redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site were followed for 7 
days and systemic solicited events including fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain were 
followed for 10 days. Although known to occur following vaccination with Prevenar 13, late onset local 
reactions were not observed following vaccination with 20vPnC in the early stage of development 
(Phase 1 and 2 studies). The choice of time for solicited local and systemic reactions in the phase 3 
trials is therefore deemed acceptable. Subjects were followed for 6 months, which is considered a 
sufficient period of time to collect relevant adverse events. AEs were collected through 30 days post-
vaccination, SAEs and NDCMCs were collected through 6-month post-vaccination.  
Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials demonstrated that 20vPnC was well tolerated in this population, with a 
safety profile similar to that of 13vPnC, and supported the initiation of Phase 3 studies of 20vPnC in 
adults. 
In all three Phase 3 trials, the safety of 20vPnC was mainly evaluated in comparison to 13vPnC. 
20vPnC contains 13 serotypes already included in the licensed vaccine Prevenar 13 plus 7 additional 
serotypes that are included in the currently marketed unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine, 
Pneumovax 23 (PPSV23). PPSV23 was used as an additional comparator vaccine, although the direct 
comparison between 20vPnC and PPSV23 is based on a too small number of subjects (Study 
B7471006, Cohort B: 246 participants received 20vPnC and 127 participants received PPSV23) to draw 
definite conclusions. 
Study B7471006 was conducted open label while studies B7471007 and B7471008 were double 
blinded. However, in the study B7471007 at Vaccination 2 (Cohort 1 only), saline and PPSV23 were 
prepared and administered by a third-party unblinded site staff member. The applicant clarified that in 
the Study B7471007 blinding of the site staff as well as the study participant was maintained. 
Exposure  
Overall, 4552 subjects received 20vPnC, while 2496 received control vaccine across all studies 
(majority of subjects received 13vPnC, while only a small number received PPSV23). The size of the 
safety database is considered sufficient for the assessment of the safety profile of 20vPnC, also taking 
into consideration that 20vPnC shares 13 serotypes with the licensed Prevenar 13, for which extensive 
safety data are available. Nonetheless, the size of the safety database limits the detection of more rare 
adverse events.  
EMA/12384/2022

Immediate Adverse Events 
The proportion of subjects who reported immediate AEs after vaccination was low, both among 
subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccine (≤0.2% after 20vPnC; ≤0.9% after 13vPnC) and among 
subjects ≥65 years of age by prior pneumococcal vaccination status (20vPnC: ≤0.4; control vaccines: 
≤0.8%).  
Solicited Adverse Events 
Across all age groups and independent of the previous pneumococcal status, observations about 
solicited AEs were consistent, with majority of participants experiencing 1 or more solicited AEs, and 
injection-site pain being the most frequently reported solicited AE, followed by myalgia and fatigue. In 
addition, most AEs were mild to moderate in intensity. Overall, the safety profile of 20vPnC was 
generally comparable to control vaccines 13vPnC/PPSV23. 
The safety results from phase 1/2 studies B7471001, B7471002 and B7471005 resemble the adverse 
event profile evaluated in the phase 3 trials. Adverse events and use of antipyretic or pain medication 
were in general comparable between treatment groups. Limitation of arm movement was not explicitly 
solicited for in the phase 3 trials, however it was solicited for and observed with 20vPnC in the study 
B7471001 (36.4% in the 20vPnC group). The applicant complied with the request to add ‘limitation of 
arm movement’ to the section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
In subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccine, local and systemic reactions were reported with a similar 
frequency after 20vPnC and Prevenar13 across all age groups. Majority of both local and systemic 
solicited AEs were mild or moderate in severity and resolved within 1-3 days in both intervention 
groups. The most frequently reported local reaction across all age groups was pain at the injection site 
(55% to 79% after 20vPnC; 54% to 78% after 13vPnC), with a trend toward decreasing frequency 
with increasing age. Other local reactions were reported at much lower frequencies (redness: 7.3% to 
8.2% after 20vPnC; 5.4% to 7.3% after 13vPnC and swelling: 7.5% to 9.1% after 20vPnC; 8.0% to 
10.8% after 13vPnC). The most frequently reported systemic event across all age groups was myalgia 
(39% to 63% after 20vPnC; 37% to 65% after 13vPnC) followed by fatigue (20vPnC: 30% to 47%; 
13vPnC: 30% to 44%), headache (21.5% to 36.7% following 20vPnC; 23.3% to 36.6% following 
13vPnC) and arthralgia (12.6% to 16.2% following 20vPnC; 13.7% to 20.7% following 13vPnC). 
In subjects ≥65 years of age with prior pneumococcal vaccination local and systemic reactions were 
reported with a similar frequency after 20vPnC or control vaccine (13vPnC or PPSV23). Solicited local 
as well as systemic reactions were primarily mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within 1-3 
days. Most frequently reported local reaction was pain at the injection site (44% to 61% after 20vPnC; 
43% to 56% after control vaccines), followed by redness (4.8% to 8.6% after 20vPnC; 2.5% to 13% 
after control vaccines) and swelling (4.0% to 9.9% after 20vPnC; 6.6% to 14% after control vaccines. 
The most frequently reported type of systemic event was muscle pain (32% to 38% after 20vPnC; 
31% to 46% after control vaccines), followed by fatigue (28.9% to 32.8% after 20vPnC; 22.3% to 
33.3% after control vaccines), headache (13.5% to 19.2% after 20vPnC; 18.2% to 21.4% after control 
vaccines) and joint pain (6.7% to 16.8% after 20vPnC; 10.7% to 15.9% after control vaccines).  
In the 13vPnC arm in Cohort A (previously vaccinated with PPSV23) the frequency of solicited local and 
systemic events was in general slightly lower than in the PPSV23 arm in Cohort B (previously 
vaccinated with 13vPnC). Therefore, frequencies of AE were slightly higher in the 20vPnC arm 
compared to 13vPnC and slightly lower in 20vPnC when compared to PPSV23.  
In subjects ≥65 years of age solicited local reaction were slightly more frequent in previously 
vaccinated (53 to 64,1% in 20vPnC vs 43.8 to 57.9% in control) compared to naïve subjects (46.5 % 
vs 45.8%) over 65 years, mostly due to higher numbers of swelling and pain at injection site. Solicited 
systemic events were comparable. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 103/120 
 
 
 
  
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
In both groups (pneumococcal vaccine naïve and with prior pneumococcal vaccine) the proportions of 
subjects reporting any AE were comparable across age groups and were similar for subjects who 
received 20vPnC or control vaccine. The most frequently reported AEs were in the SOC Infections and 
Infestations (≤5.1% after 20vPnC; ≤5.4% after 13vPnC). 
Among subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccine, the proportions of those reporting any AE within 1 
month after vaccination were 8.4% to 10% following vaccination with 20vPnC and 7.3% to 11% 
following vaccination with 13vPnC. 
In subjects ≥65 years of age unsolicited local reaction were slightly less frequent in previously 
vaccinated (4.9% to 7.5% in 20vPnC vs 9% to 11% in control) compared to naïve subjects (9.1% in 
20vPnC vs 11.6% in control) over 65 years. 
In the Phase 1 trial (B7471001), serial cardiac enzyme (cardiac troponin I) levels were assessed as a 
response to nonclinical observations of microscopic inflammation with degeneration/necrosis of cardiac 
myocytes or myocardial fibrosis in a small number of rabbits in the repeat-dose toxicity study. No 
elevations in troponin I were observed in the Phase 1 trial and no other cardiovascular concerns were 
identified by the applicant in Phase 1 or subsequent phases of vaccine development. However, as 
several cardiac events were reported in phase 2 and 3 studies, the applicant was asked to provide 
reassurance that these were indeed not related to the vaccine. A comprehensive analysis of cardiac 
events was submitted and no apparent evidence of an increased risk of cardiac AEs with the use of 
20vPnC could be observed. 
Related Adverse Events 
AEs considered related to study vaccine were reported with a similar frequency in subjects naïve to 
pneumococcal vaccine after 20vPnC (≤0.9%) and after 13vPnC (≤1.5%) vaccination. The most 
frequently reported types of AEs considered to be related to study vaccine were injection site reactions. 
AEs considered related to study vaccine were reported with a similar frequency in subjects ≥65 years 
of age with prior pneumococcal vaccination status after 20vPnC (≤1.6% of subjects) and after control 
vaccines (≤2.4% of subjects). None of the provided tables for related AEs included solicited adverse 
events, therefore tabular listings of all vaccine-related AEs including solicited injection-site and 
systemic AEs were requested for all studies and for the pooled analysis of studies B7471007 (Cohort 3) 
and B7471008 and respective data have been provided.  
Newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs) 
The proportions of subjects reporting NDCMCs was low, both among subjects naïve to pneumococcal 
vaccine (≤2.3% after both 20vPnC and 13vPnC) and among subjects ≥65 years of age by prior 
pneumococcal vaccination status (≤4.0% after 20vPnC; ≤2.4% after control vaccines). Overall, the 
NDCMCs reported were generally diseases and conditions often observed in adults in these age groups. 
As of the cut-off date, two cases of autoimmune disorders (Basedow’s disease [1] and rheumatoid 
arthritis [1]) were reported after 20nPvC. Regarding the theoretical increased risk of autoimmune 
disorders after immunisation, the applicant was asked to provide additional information about these 
case-reports. Based on the reported information, it was agreed that there is no need to act for the time 
being.  
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 104/120 
 
 
 
  
 
Serious Adverse Events and Death 
Overall, the proportion of patients with SAEs occurring 6 months after vaccination was low and 
comparable between study vaccine in both vaccine naïve (≤2.4%) as well as previously vaccinated 
subjects (20vPnC (≤2.4%) and control vaccine (≤1.6%). In pneumococcal naïve group SAEs were 
reported at a slightly higher frequency among subjects ≥60 years of age (2.4% after 20vPnC, 1.9% 
after 13vPnC) than in younger age groups (≤0.9% after either vaccine). In subjects ≥65 years of age 
serious AE were slightly less frequent in previously vaccinated (0.8% to 2.4% in 20vPnC vs 1.6% in 
control) compared to naïve subjects (3.7% in 20vPnC vs 2.8% in control) over 65 years. Since no 
subject narratives of serious adverse events were submitted, no assessment of SAEs can be made to 
confirm applicant’s claims of unrelatedness. Upon request respective subject narratives for all serious 
adverse events reported in Phase 3 studies were provided. Majority of serious adverse events occurred 
in older participants with significant co-morbidities and investigator’s conclusion that they are most 
likely attributable to underlying medical conditions and confounding factors, which was also concurred 
by the applicant, is agreed. Considering close temporal relationship with the vaccine administration and 
absence of pertinent medical history, the applicant was asked to provide a detailed discussion how the 
unrelatedness to 20vPnC was inferred for the events of pulmonary embolism and transient ischemic 
attack. Based in the provided information, the applicant’s conclusion that there was no causal 
relationship between the 20vPnC and the events of pulmonary embolism and transient ischemic attack 
is agreed. 
Over the course of the 6 studies, 2 participants died. One participant in B7471007 Cohort 1 who 
received 20vPnC and one participant in study B7471001 died 75 days after 20vPnC vaccination, both 
due to traumatic injuries. None were related to study interventions.   
Safety in special populations 
Age, sex, race 
As expected, increasing age led to a decrease in reactogenicity. For the solicited AEs this decrease was 
seen for injection-site pain in study B7471007. Besides the lower frequency, the overall profile of AE 
remained similar.  
Trends of higher frequency of both local and systemic reactions in females compared to males were 
seen, but do not impact the use of the vaccine.    
Sex, race and age did not have a major impact on the overall safety profile of 20vPnC. 
Prior pneumococcal vaccination 
Prior pneumococcal vaccination has no major impact on the safety profile of 20vPnC, as the overall 
safety profile in participants with prior exposure to 13vPnC/PPSV23 was similar to the safety profile in 
the pneumococcal vaccine naïve population and no new safety signals are observed. In subjects ≥65 
years of age solicited local reaction were slightly more frequent in previously vaccinated (53 to 64,1% 
in 20vPnC vs 43.8% to 57.9% in control) compared to naïve subjects (46.5 % vs 45.8%) over 65 
years, mostly due to higher numbers of swelling and pain at injection site. In subjects ≥65 years of 
age unsolicited local reaction were slightly less frequent in previously vaccinated (4.9% to 7.5% in 
20vPnC vs 9% to 11% in control) compared to naïve subjects (9.1% in 20vPnC vs 11.6% in control) 
over 65 years. Beside these slight differences in solicited local reactions and unsolicited reactions, the 
AEs were reported in similar proportions in both intervention groups and no concerns are raised. 
Use in pregnancy/lactation 
Currently there are no clinical data on the use of this vaccine in women who are pregnant/lactating and 
respective adaptions in the SmPC were requested. No vaccine-related effects on female fertility or the 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 105/120 
 
 
 
  
development of foetus or offspring were observed in a fertility and developmental toxicity study of 
20vPnC in rabbits. Eight reports of pregnancy had been received from clinical trials [B7471007 (2), 
B7471008 (6)]; none reported associated clinical adverse events (AEs). There were no cases reporting 
20vPnC administration during breastfeeding. 
However, as currently available data on 20vPnC vaccine administered to pregnant women are 
insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy, 20vPnC should only be considered when 
the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. Respective sections in 
the SmPC were adapted.  
Individuals at increased risk for pneumococcal disease 
In the B7471007 safety population, approximately 34% of participants had risk factors for serious 
pneumococcal disease at enrolment including smoking (13%), chronic cardiovascular disease (5.5%), 
chronic pulmonary disease including asthma (8.7%), chronic liver disease (0.4%), and diabetes 
mellitus (14%). The safety and immunogenicity of 7vPnC and 13vPnC in the high-risk populations 
generally reflected the same profile observed for 13vPnC in the general population, although responses 
were lower in immunocompromised individuals, as would be expected given the altered ability to 
respond to vaccines. Reduced immune response was observed with 20vPnC in comparison to 13vPnC 
(see OC in the efficacy part) which raises doubts about the protective effect of 20vPnC in patients with 
risk factors for IPD. Nonetheless, this is not expected to have negative effects on the safety in this 
group of patients.  
Studies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and bone marrow transplant participants have not 
been conducted with 20vPnC, which could be acceptable. Respective sections were included in the 
SmPC, also referring to data from Prevenar 13. 
In general, the safety profile in the different subgroups was similar to the safety profile in the overall 
population and no new safety signals are observed. 
No concerns arise from the review of reported AEs following Vaccination 2 in the 20vPnC/saline group 
in Cohort 1.  
Immunological events 
Among pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects, two cases of hypersensitivity judged unrelated to the 
study vaccine were reported. Hypersensitivity is listed as an adverse reaction in the PI. 
Concomitant administration 
No data are available regarding concomitant use of 20vPnC with other vaccines in adults. However, a 
safety and immunogenicity trial of 20vPnC co-administered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine 
in adults ≥65 years of age is currently ongoing. No other studies have been conducted to examine the 
concomitant administration of 20vPnC with other vaccines licensed for use in adults 18 years of age 
and older. 
Data from post-marketing clinical study evaluating the impact of prophylactic use of antipyretics 
(ibuprofen and paracetamol) on the immune response to 13vPnC suggest that administration of 
paracetamol concomitantly or within the same day of vaccination may reduce the immune response to 
13vPnC after the infant series (infants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years). The applicant was asked 
to discuss whether the same could also be extrapolated to adults receiving concomitantly 20vPnC and 
the same antipyretics. The applicant provided a reassuring discussion and confirmed that the effect 
observed in infants is not likely to replicate in adults.

Discontinuation due to AE 
Only participants in the Cohort 1 of study B7471007 received a second vaccine (20vPnC/saline or 
13vPnC/PPSV23) and could be discontinued from the study intervention. All subjects in this cohort 
were ≥60 years of age. The proportion of participants who discontinued the study were generally 
comparable across groups (12 subjects (0.8%) who received 20vPnC and 8 (0.5%) who received 
13vPnC). 
Out of AEs which led to discontinuation, 5/12 (20vPnC arm) and 4/8 (13vPnC arm) were vaccine 
related. These AEs were mostly injection site reactions. In both arms, the intensity (severity) of AEs 
ranged from mild to severe, with severe AEs being swelling and erythema (following 20vPnC) and 
bronchial hyperreactivity (following Prevenar 13).  
All adverse reactions reported in clinical trials that were considered related to the IP have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of 20vPnC appears to be comparable to the safety profile of 13vPnC. Furthermore, 
no major safety differences between 20vPnC and PPSV23 were observed, although the number of 
subjects who received PPSV23 was too small to draw definite conclusions. A majority of participants 
reported 1 or more AEs, mostly mild or moderate in intensity and of short duration. The most 
frequently reported AEs by PT were solicited AEs including injection-site pain, myalgia, fatigue, 
headache, joint pain, swelling and redness. As expected, reactogenicity decreased with age, especially 
for solicited local and systemic reactions. The safety profile was also overall comparable between 
pneumococcal vaccine naïve adults ≥18 years of age and adults ≥65 years of age who have previously 
been vaccinated with 13vPnC/PPSV23. No deaths occurred that were considered possibly related. 
All outstanding issues have been resolved. In conclusion, 20vPnC is well tolerated in adults ≥18 years 
and no major safety concerns were identified.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Pneumococcal disease mainly presents as non-invasive disease, such as non-bacteraemic pneumonia, 
sinusitis or acute otitis media (the latter most commonly in young children). The less frequent albeit 
generally more severe invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) occurs when S. pneumoniae gains access 
to more distal, normally sterile anatomical sites. IPD presents as meningitis, bacteraemic pneumonia, 
bacteraemia without focus and septic arthritis. In general, pneumococcal pneumonia is associated with 
complications and long-term sequelae in all age groups (e.g. respiratory failure requiring 
hospitalisation, exacerbations of chronic medical conditions, decline in quality of life, increased risk of 
death within 30 days (acute) and 1 year (long-term) after the event.)  
Pneumococcal disease burden is highest in young children ≤5 yoa and older adults ≥65 yoa. 
Irrespective of age, certain comorbid conditions (e.g. chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, 
chronic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, asthma) and immunodeficiency (e.g. HIV, HSCT patients) and 
lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking) predispose to pneumococcal disease. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Disease Treatment 
S. pneumoniae infections are treated based on clinical presentation and susceptibility data to 
antimicrobials. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are the most commonly used antimicrobials against S. 
pneumoniae. Although S.pneumoniae is not considered as a “classical” multi-resistant pathogen, 
increasing resistance rates have been reported which may lead to treatment failures. 
Disease Prevention 
Recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in adults are typically based on age or risk for 
pneumococcal disease. However national recommendations differ world-wide and also within the EU. 
In the EU, prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults currently includes vaccination with two 
authorised vaccines - Prevenar 13 (13vPnC, protein-conjugated) and PNEUMOVAX23 (PPSV23, 
polysaccharide, unconjugated) - and the prophylactic use of antibiotics in special populations. 
Serotypes currently covered by vaccines are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F 
(Prevenar 13) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 20, 
22F, 23F and 33F (PNEUMOVAX23). 
20vPnC targets the same 13 serotypes as Prevenar 13 plus seven additional serotypes which are also 
targeted by PNEUMOVAX23 (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F). The applicant is also the marketing 
authorisation holder of Prevenar 13. 
During this procedure, Vaxneuvance received a positive CHMP opinion (14 10 2021), with a 
Commission Decision (authorisation) adopted on 13.12.2021. This pertains a 15-valent pneumococcal 
vaccine containing the 13 serotypes included in Prevenar 13 and additionally serotypes 22F and 33F. 
All 15 serotypes are also contained in 20vPnC.

Unmet medical need 
While current vaccination campaigns against S. pneumoniae have led to a substantial reduction in 
pneumococcal disease burden, mortality rates particularly for IPD in older adults and adults with 
certain comorbidities have remained high. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 
2016 Lower Respiratory Infections Collaborators, The Lancet), S. pneumoniae was “the leading cause 
of lower respiratory infection morbidity and mortality globally, contributing to more deaths than all 
other aetiologies combined in 2016 (1 189 937 deaths, 95% UI 690 445–1 770 660)”. 
Serotype replacement (i.e. more frequent isolation of disease-causing serotypes not covered by 
current vaccines) is a commonly observed phenomenon. Vaccines with broader serotype coverage, 
(ideally serotype-independent) and higher effectiveness against certain serotypes targeted by 
authorised vaccines are highly warranted. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical programme to develop 20vPnC consists of six randomised controlled trials (three Phase 3, 
one Phase 2, two Phase 1 studies) to study immunogenicity and safety. No efficacy studies have been 
conducted. Since currently no correlate of protection has been established in the target population, the 
clinical development aims at demonstrating comparative immunogenicity between 20vPnC and 
vaccines with proven protective efficacy: 13vPnC (for the 13 shared serotypes) and PPSV23 (for the 7 
additional serotypes). This immuno-bridging approach is in accordance with the respective EMA 
guidance (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005) and has been agreed on in a Scientific Advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/3940/1/2018/III CORRIGENDUM).  
Immunogenicity data obtained from the Phase 3 studies B7471007 (pivotal) and B7471006 are 
considered main evidence for this MAA. 
B7471007 was the pivotal non-inferiority trial in pneumococcal vaccine naïve adults ≥18 years of age, 
that was intended to establish the immunological bridge to the comparator vaccines. Participants were 
enrolled into 3 cohorts based on age. The applicant plans to establish the required immunological 
bridge to vaccines with known efficacy by establishing non-inferior immune response in cohort 1 first 
(subjects ≥ 60 yoa) and extend the bridge to other age groups by showing non-inferior immune 
response of all 20 serotypes in a subset of cohort 1 and the younger cohorts 2 (50-59 yoa) and 3 (18-
49 yoa).  
Study B7471006 evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC in adults ≥65 yoa with prior 
pneumococcal vaccination. Participants were enrolled into 3 cohorts based on their pneumococcal 
vaccination history (PPSV23, 13vPnC or 13vPnC/PPSV23). 
In all submitted studies, 20vPnC was administered as a single dose, which is in line with both 
comparator vaccines. Immunogenicity data was collected immediately before and one month after 
vaccination in all studies. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titres were used as surrogate marker for immune response in all 
studies. 20vPnC induced immune response against all 20 serotypes in all studies and subgroups. 
Immune responses were generally higher in younger subjects and decreased with age but was still 
present in subjects ≥70 years of age. Subjects without risk factors for pneumococcal disease showed 
higher immune response compared to subjects with risk factors. Further, pneumococcal vaccine naïve 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 111/120 
 
 
 
  
subjects showed higher titres compared to subjects with pneumococcal vaccination history, especially 
when previously vaccinated with PPSV23.  
Non-inferiority against 13vPnC. The defined non-inferiority criteria – the lower bound of the 2-sided 
95% CI for the OPA GMT ratio of 20vPnC/13vPnC > 0.5 - were met for all 13 shared serotypes in 
adults ≥ 60 yoa (cohort 1, B7471007).   
Non-inferiority against PPSV23. The defined non-inferiority criteria – the lower bound of the 2-
sided 95% CI for the OPA GMT ratio of 20vPnC/PPSV23 > 0.5 - were met for six of the seven 
additional serotypes in adults ≥ 60 yoa (cohort 1, B7471007). Serotype 8 missed the lower margin 
with a GMT ratio of 0.55 (0.49, 0.62). OPA GMT ratios for the six other serotypes were clearly above 1. 
Non-inferiority of younger subjects (cohort 2: 50-59yoa, cohort 3: 18-49 yoa) to older 
subjects (60-64 yoa). The defined non-inferiority criteria – the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI 
for the respective OPA GMT ratio of younger cohort/(60-64yoa) > 0.5 - were met for all serotypes for 
both younger cohorts. While the immune responses induced by 20vPnC vaccination in the youngest 
cohorts (adults 18-49) were higher than in adults ≥ 60 yoa, the immune response in cohort including 
adults 50-59 yoa was overall similar or higher compared to the oldest cohort.  
Additional endpoints further showed similar trends to these results (serotype-specific GMFRs, 
proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold in OPA titres, serotype-specific OPA titres ≥LLOQ). 
Long term data for 20vPnC is available for approx. 200 subjects from phase 2 study (B7471002). 
Data from 12 months after the first vaccination indicate that OPA GMTs declined over time to approx. 
30% (range 11-55%) compared to one month after vaccination but remained above baseline levels.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No efficacy or effectiveness data is available for 20vPnC. The application is based on an 
immunological bridge comparing humoral immune responses induced by 20vPnC and authorised 
vaccines (13vPnC and PPSV23) that are known to protect against pneumococcal disease. 
No correlate of protection against pneumococcal disease exists in adults. Opsonophagocytic activity 
(OPA) titres are commonly used as surrogate markers for a protective effect as they reflect the in vivo 
scenario of antibody-mediated protection, yet no threshold for a protective effect has been established. 
Comparisons across serotypes are also not possible due to different capsule compositions, potentially 
resulting in different titres required for protection for each serotype. The comparative approach to 
vaccines with known efficacy is therefore essential for the interpretation of a potential protective effect 
of 20vPnC.  
The clinical relevance of the applied non-inferiority margin of 0.5 has not been justified and it is 
not known whether meeting the defined criteria will result in a clinically relevant protection. The 
applicant has been advised accordingly in a scientific advice procedure (EMEA/H/SA/3940/1/2018/III 
CORRIGENDUM).   
Reduced response compared to 13vPnC: Despite meeting non-inferiority for all 13 shared 
serotypes between 20vPnC and 13vPnC, a consistent trend of numerically lower GMTs with ratios of 
about 0.8 [20vPnC/13vPnC] became apparent. Further, the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the 
GMT ratio did not contain 1.00 for most serotypes. The ~20% reduction has been consistently 
observed in all studies for which respective data for 13vPnC was available. The lower titres are 
especially of concern for serotype 3, which is still the second most common serotype causing invasive 
pneumococcal disease in the EU in younger adults and the most common serotype in subjects >65 yoa 
(~14% across age groups in 2018; ECDC AER) despite being included in currently approved vaccines. 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 112/120 
 
 
 
  
Serotype 8: The immune response against serotype 8 induced by 20vPnC compared to PPSV23 
missed the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion (GMR: 0.55 (0.49; 0.62, 2-sided 95% CI)). Although 
not meeting the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.5, might be explained technically by multiplicity 
aspects, the response differs drastically to all other 6 additional serotypes, which showed much higher 
titres compared to PPSV23. Concerning the lower titres and the potentially reduced protective effect, 
the applicant argued that immune response elicited with PPSV23 and 20vPnC are difficult to compare 
due to the different vaccine types (polysaccharide vs conjugate vaccine), which is in general 
acknowledged, but this does not mitigate the concerns.  
Bridging to younger subjects: A comparison performed by the assessors (based on data in the 
report annex) shows reduced immune response of 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC also in the younger 
cohorts. In subjects 50-59 yoa the non-inferiority criteria might have even been missed for some 
serotypes. Despite being lower compared to 13vPnC in the respective age group, the observed titres 
are higher than the titres obtained with 13vPnC in cohort 1 (≥60yoa), consequently a protective effect 
for the induced immune response in both younger cohorts can be assumed for 20vPnC. 
Persistence. Throughout the clinical development programme, humoral immune responses were 
compared one month after vaccination. The phase 2 study (B7471002) is the only study included in 
the application that provides (exploratory) long-term data one year after vaccination. Unfortunately, 
this study does not allow for a direct comparison between 20vPnC and 13vPnC at this later time point, 
as sequential regimes 20vPnC/saline and 13vPnC/PPSV23 were compared. Therefore, it is unknown 
whether OPA GMTs induced by 20vPnC vs 13vPnC differ over time.  
Whether a protective effect can be claimed or how long such an effect could be claimed for subjects 
with already reduced immune response is currently unclear, including subjects with risk factors 
and subjects with prior pneumococcal vaccination with PPSV23.  
No dedicated studies in adults at high risk for pneumococcal disease (e.g. asplenia, HIV, 
haematopoietic stem cell transplants or other immunocompromising conditions) were conducted. The 
applicant argues that prior (albeit limited) experience with 7vPnC and 13vPnC in these populations is 
also applicable to 20vPnC. This strategy had been considered acceptable in a previous scientific advice 
provided that comparable immunogenicity and safety in immunocompetent subjects can be shown 
between 20vPnC and 13vPnC. Given the observed reduced immune response, it is currently not clear 
whether data from 13vPnC can be extrapolated in this population. 
Concomitant vaccination. No data on concomitant vaccination with other vaccines relevant to the 
target population were provided.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of 20vPnC was overall comparable to the safety profile of the control vaccines 
(13vPnC/ PPSV23).  
Across all age groups and independent of the previous pneumococcal vaccination status, observations 
about solicited AEs were consistent, with the majority of participants experiencing 1 or more solicited 
AEs, and injection-site pain being the most frequently reported solicited AE, followed by myalgia and 
fatigue. In addition, most AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved within 1-3 days.  
In subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccines, local and systemic solicited AEs were reported with a 
similar frequency after 20vPnC and Prevenar 13: 
- 
Pain at the injection site: 55% to 79% after 20vPnC, 54% to 78% after 13vPnC; 
-  Redness: 7.3% to 8.2% after 20vPnC; 5.4% to 7.3% after 13vPnC;  
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 113/120 
 
 
 
  
- 
Swelling: 7.5% to 9.1% after 20vPnC; 8.0% to 10.8% after 13vPnC; 
-  Myalgia: 39% to 63% after 20vPnC; 37% to 65% after 13vPnC; 
- 
Fatigue: 30% to 47% after 20vPnC; 30% to 44% after 13vPnC;  
-  Headache: 21.5% to 36.7% after 20vPnC; 23.3% to 36.6% after 13vPnC; 
- 
Arthralgia: 12.6% to 16.2% after 20vPnC; 13.7% to 20.7% after 13vPnC. 
In subjects ≥65 years of age with prior pneumococcal vaccination local and systemic reactions were 
overall reported with a similar frequency. Frequencies of AE were slightly higher in the 20vPnC arm 
compared to 13vPnC and similar or slightly lower in 20vPnC when compared to PPSV23: 
- 
Pain at the injection site: 44% to 61% after 20vPnC; 43% to 56% after control vaccines; 
-  Redness: 4.8% to 8.6% after 20vPnC; 2.5% to 13% after control vaccines; 
- 
Swelling: 4.0% to 9.9% after 20vPnC; 6.6% to 14% after control vaccines 
-  Myalgia: 32% to 38% after 20vPnC; 31% to 46% after control vaccines; 
- 
Fatigue: 28.9% to 32.8% after 20vPnC; 22.3% to 33.3% after control vaccines;  
-  Headache: 13.5% to 19.2% after 20vPnC; 18.2% to 21.4% after control vaccines; 
- 
Arthralgia: 6.7% to 16.8% after 20vPnC; 10.7% to 15.9% after control vaccines. 
In both groups (pneumococcal vaccine naïve and with prior pneumococcal vaccination) the proportions 
of subjects reporting any AE were comparable across age groups and were similar for subjects who 
received 20vPnC or control vaccine. The most frequently reported AEs were in the SOC Infections and 
Infestations. In subjects ≥65 years of age unsolicited local reaction were slightly less frequent in 
previously vaccinated compared to naïve subjects over 65 years. 
AEs considered related to study vaccine were reported with a similar frequency after 20vPnC and after 
control vaccines for both subjects naïve to pneumococcal vaccine and subjects ≥65 years of age with 
prior pneumococcal vaccination status.  
Overall, the proportion of patients with SAEs occurring 6 months after vaccination was low and 
comparable between study and control vaccine in both vaccine naïve (≤2.4%) and previously 
vaccinated subjects (20vPnC (≤2.4%) and control vaccine (≤1.6%). In pneumococcal naïve treatment 
group SAEs were reported at a slightly higher frequency among subjects ≥60 years of age (2.4% after 
20vPnC, 1.9% after 13vPnC) than in younger age groups (≤0.9% after either vaccine). In subjects 
≥65 years of age serious AE were slightly less frequent in previously vaccinated (0.8% to 2.4% in 
20vPnC vs 1.6% in control) compared to naïve subjects (3.7% in 20vPnC vs 2.8.6% in control) over 65 
years. 
As expected, increasing age led to a decrease in reactogenicity, most noticeably for injection-site pain. 
Beside the lower frequency, the overall profile of AE remained similar. 
Prior pneumococcal vaccination does not seem to have a major impact on the safety profile of 20vPnC, 
as the overall safety profile in participants with prior exposure to 13vPnC/PPSV23 was similar to the 
safety profile in the pneumococcal vaccine naïve population and no new safety signals are observed. 
Deaths: In total, two participants died during the studies due to traumatic injuries, The deaths were 
considered not related to study vaccine.   
In total 20 participants had AEs leading to study discontinuation. Out of AEs which led to 
discontinuation, 5/12 (20vPnC arm) and 4/8 (13vPnC arm) were vaccine related. Related AEs were 
mostly injection site reactions and the intensity (severity) of AEs ranged from mild to severe in both 
arms, with severe AEs being swelling and erythema (following 20vPnC) and bronchial hyperreactivity 
(following Prevenar 13).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Comparison to PPSV23: In all three Phase 3 trials, the safety of 20vPnC was mainly evaluated in 
comparison to 13vPnC. PPSV23 was used as an additional comparator vaccine in most studies. A direct 
comparison between 20vPnC and PPSV23 included only a limited number of subjects, hampering 
conclusions (Study B7471006, Cohort B: 246 participants treated with 20vPnC and 127 participants 
treated with PPSV23).  
Serious AEs: No assessment of SAEs and their relatedness to the study vaccine could be made based 
on the initially provided data. In order to confirm the applicant’s claims of unrelatedness, subject 
narratives for all serious adverse events reported in the Phase 3 studies were requested. Following 
additional information provided by the applicant, investigator’s conclusions on the relationship to the 
medicine (or lack thereof) seemed justified and were accepted.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
This application relies on establishing an immunological bridge to authorised vaccines with known 
protective efficacy against pneumococcal disease (13vPnC and PPSV23). No efficacy or effectiveness 
data has been submitted. This approach is in general acceptable and in line with respective EMA 
guidance and previous scientific advice.  
In the pivotal study, in subjects ≥ 60 yoa, the defined non-inferior criteria were met for all 13 
serotypes shared with 13vPnC and for 6 of the 7 additional serotypes also targeted by PPSV23 (except 
serotype 8, which showed a pronounced difference compared to the other new serotypes). 
Nevertheless, consistently numerically lower titres have been observed for most shared serotypes 
(GMT ratios of about 0.8 [20vPnC/13vPnC] and the upper limit of the 95% CI below 1). This approx. 
20% reduction was consistently observed in all other studies in which 13vPnC comparator data were 
generated. The clinical relevance of this reduction is currently unclear, especially since 20vPnC is 
essentially the same vaccine as 13vPnC. These findings have been reflected in the SmPC to provide 
relevant information to the prescriber. The applicant also outlined how the clinical relevance of the 
numerically reduced immune response of most shared serotypes and serotype 8 will be further 
investigated and how inferring effectiveness of 20vPnC will be further confirmed by appropriate post-
marketing studies. Taken together, the presented post-marketing studies are expected to provide 
EMA/12384/2022  
Page 116/120 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
valuable information on 20vPnC effectiveness, and the remaining uncertainties related to the clinical 
impact of numerically reduced immune responses elicited by 20vPnC compared to the majority of 
serotypes shared with 13vPnC and serotype 8.  
The planned post-marketing studies are included as post-authorisation measures in SmPC Annex II. 
Notably, in Europe serotype 8 is the most common serotype causing IPD in subjects 18-65 yoa 
(approx. 22-32% of reported IPD cases) and after serotype 3 (14.7%) the second most common IPD 
causing serotype in adults ≥65 yoa (14.0%). Both serotypes are increasing in prevalence in the last 
years (2018; ECDC AER). At the same time, however, it is acknowledged, that 20vPnC offers the 
potential benefits of a conjugate vaccine to target serotype 8, which is so far only included in the 
polysaccharide vaccine PPSV23. 
Regarding the bridge to younger subjects, all non-inferiority criteria were met when comparing 20vPnC 
vaccination in adults 60-64 yoa to adults 50-59 yoa or 18-49 yoa. This was expected as immune 
responses generally decline with age. No formal comparison between 13vPnC and 20vPnC in younger 
subjects was performed by the applicant. However, a comparison by the assessors shows similar 
reduced immune response of 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC also in the younger cohorts. The titres 
induced by 20vPnC are, however, higher than the titres induced by 13vPnC in 60-64-year-old subjects, 
which is assumed to provide a protective effect. Therefore, although this aspect of the bridging 
approach is not considered ideal, it can be concluded that 20vPnC has a similar effect regardless of age 
and that initially protective titres are reached in subjects younger than 60 years.  
Even if the titres induced by primary vaccination with 20vPnC can be assumed to provide a protective 
effect, the consistently lower immune response affects the ability to extrapolate other aspects like 
persistence and expected magnitude of a potential booster response from 13vPnC. Numerically lower 
initial titres might lead to an earlier loss of protection compared to 13vPnC. However, OPA GMTs 
induced by 20vPnC and 13vPnC followed one month later by PPSV23 decline to a similar extent one 
year after vaccination, which is preliminarily reassuring. Still, it has to be assumed that, given the 
numerically lower induced titres and a similar decline, the protective effect of 20vPnC will wane off 
earlier than the protective effect induced by 13vPnC. The need of another vaccination schedule (e.g. 
additional dose), especially for risk groups has not been discussed.  
In addition, it is unclear how these findings manifest regarding initial and long-term protection in 
subjects with numerically lower immune response compared to healthy subjects, including subjects 
with risk factors regardless of age or subjects with prior PPSV23 vaccination, for whom no comparative 
data to 13vPnC is available. Furthermore, it is not clear whether data from 13vPnC can be extrapolated 
for subjects at high risk of pneumococcal infection (e.g. with immunocompromising conditions), who 
have not been included in the development programme. Respective wording for the SmPC has been 
implemented.  
Although post-marketing plans have been outlined, some aspects of 20vPnC vaccine effectiveness are 
not specifically addressed including (younger) subjects at risk for pneumococcal disease, primed 
subjects or immunocompromised patients. Nevertheless, if vaccine effectiveness is shown in the 
planned studies, this will provide reassurance concerning those populations. 
The documented safety exposure is considered sufficient for the assessment of the safety profile of 
20vPnC.  
The safety profile of 20vPnC was overall comparable to the safety profile of 13vPnC/PPSV23. In the 
six studies submitted in the dossier, no new safety signals were observed for 20vPnC compared to 
13vPnC/PPSV23. In subjects ≥65 years of age with prior pneumococcal vaccination 20vPnC was 
slightly more reactogenic compared to 13vPnC, leading to a higher percentage of participants 
experiencing 1 or more AEs; and similar or less reactogenic compared to PPSV23. For all three

interventions, most participants experienced 1 or more AEs in all studies and the most commonly 
reported AEs were solicited AEs. 20vPnC is well-tolerated since most of the AEs are mild in intensity, of 
short duration (≤ 3 days) and the discontinuations due to adverse events are low. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
20vPnC was immunogenic across all subgroups tested. Several uncertainties have been identified that 
preclude final conclusions on the potential clinical benefit. Although additional coverage of seven 
serotypes with 20vPnC compared to 13vPnC is considered beneficial, the observed reduced immune 
response of 11 of the 13 serotypes shared with 13vPnC and of serotype 8 are of concern. While the 
advantage of targeting 6 additional serotypes is acknowledged - together they currently account for 
about 21% of confirmed cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (2018; ECDC AER) - the clinical 
relevance of the observed lower GMTs for serotype 8 and serotypes shared with 13vPnC is unknown. 
Since invasive pneumococcal disease/pneumonia can be life-threatening or severely debilitating, 
especially for at-risk populations, the observed reduction in GMTs, especially for both most common 
serotypes causing invasive disease, is still of concern. The applicant confirmed that 20vPnC real –world 
effectiveness as regards impact on IPD as well as VT- CAP will be addressed further in the post-
marketing. Information on breakthrough disease will be collected through European national and ECDC 
surveillance systems to be submitted annually. This is considered important to address the remaining 
uncertainties regarding the lower titres induced by 20vPnC vaccination compared to 13vPnC and to 
serotype 8.  
The currently outlined post-marketing strategy does not foresee to specifically study 20vPnC 
effectiveness in at-risk subjects. However, it is expected that 20vPnC effectiveness data generated 
post-approval in the general population will also provide further information to this more vulnerable 
group.  In addition, these findings have been reflected in the SmPC to provide relevant information to 
the prescriber. 
The safety profile of 20vPnC is characterised by injection-site pain, muscle pain, fatigue, headache, 
joint pain, swelling and redness.  
Overall, the benefit risk balance is deemed positive.   
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Apexxnar is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.

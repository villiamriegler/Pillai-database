events, such as severe nausea, aspiration pneumonia, 
multiple organ failure and death.

In order to fulfil specific obligation (SOB 002), the MAH 
the final overall survival analysis of C16010 China 
Annex II 
submitted the final results and final overall survival (OS) 
continuation study, a phase III study comparing 
ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
versus placebo plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and/or 
refractory multiple myeloma, in order to fulfil SOB 
(Specific Obligation) 002. Annex II.E and the RMP 
(version 2.1) are updated accordingly. In addition 
the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to include the date of marketing 
authorisation in section 9 of the SmPC, to make a 
small correction in the Product Information to the 
Finnish, German and Swedish translations. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
results of the C16010 China continuation study. This was a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study 
conducted in China (N=115) comparing ixazomib plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus placebo plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed 
and/or refractory multiple myeloma, with a similar study 
design and eligibility criteria than the main C16010 study. 
Many of the patients enrolled in the study had advanced 
disease with Durie-Salmon Stage III (69%) at initial 
diagnosis and a treatment history of receiving at least 2 
prior therapies (60%) and being thalidomide refractory 
(63%). At the primary analysis (median follow up of 8 
months and a median of 6 cycles), the median progression 
free survival (PFS) was 6.7 months in the Ninlaro regimen 
compared to 4 months in the placebo regimen (p-

median follow up of 19.8 months, overall survival (OS) was 
improved for patients treated in the ixazomib regimen 
compared with placebo [p-value=0.0014, HR=0.42, 95% 
CI: 0.242, 0.726 ]). Based on the final results of the 
C16010 China continuation study, the pooled safety data 
from the pivotal studies global C16010 and C10610 China 
continuation studies have been reflected in section 4.8 
‘Undesirable effects’ of the SmPC and the frequency of the 
adverse drug reactions ‘Herpes zoster’ was therefore 
updated from ‘uncommon’ to ‘common’ and ‘vomiting’ from 
common to uncommon.

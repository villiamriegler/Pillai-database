TachoSil is a ready-to-use degradable surgical patch developed for topical use to support intraoperative 
haemostasis and tissue sealing. TachoSil was approved by the European Commission in 2004. 
The purpose of this type II variation is to request to expand the currently approved indications of 
TachoSil in adults for use in the paediatric population (see under 2.1.1). 
This application is mainly based on available publications reporting data with off-label use of TachoSil in 
children. As supportive information, the applicant further referred to data from paediatric patients from 
study TC- 2402-040-SP and from a comparative study in adult and paediatric patients undergoing hepatic 
resection surgery (Study TC-019-IN). Data from Study TC-019-IN, a prematurely stopped prospective, 
uncontrolled study in paediatric subjects, were also included into a pool of paediatric data.

2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Haemostasis is a rather complex process. The injury of a blood vessel triggers the following sequence of 
events: (i) vessel constriction to reduce blood flow; (ii) adherence of circulating platelets to the vessel 
wall at the site of the trauma; and (iii) platelet activation and aggregation, coupled with an intricate 
series of enzymatic reactions involving coagulation proteins that produce fibrin to form a stable 
haemostatic plug. The aim of all haemostatic agents (Has) is to act by imitating, promoting, or bypassing 
specific steps of the coagulation cascade. The haemostatic system is incompletely developed at birth and 
matures throughout infancy. Although all key components of the haemostatic system are present at birth, 
important quantitative and qualitative differences exist between neonates and adults. The concentration 
of clotting factors in human blood changes after birth, until adulthood, at different levels (as published in 
the Meta-Analysis by Toulon et (2016), Developmental haemostasis: laboratory and clinical implications. 
Int. Jnl. Lab. Hem., 38: 66-77), Prothrombin (PT, Factor II) and Fibrinogen (Factor I), coagulation factors 
of the last stage of the blood clotting cascade, reach their normal level within the first year after birth. 
The current indication (Section 4.1 SmPC) for TachoSil in adults covers “supportive treatment in surgery, 
improvement of haemostasis, promotion of tissue sealing, suture support in vascular surgery where 
standard techniques are insufficient, and supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative 
cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery”. 
As part of the present  type II variation the MAH applied to expand the above-mentioned indication of 
TachoSil for use in the paediatric population. The claimed indication was as follows: “TachoSil is indicated 
in adults and children aged 1month to 18 years for supportive treatment in surgery, for improvement of 
haemostasis, to promote tissue sealing, for suture support in vascular surgery where standard techniques 
are insufficient, and for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal 
leakage following neurological surgery (see section 5.1).” 
The recommended indication is as follows: “TachoSil is indicated in adults and children from 1 month of 
age for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis, to promote tissue sealing and 
for suture support in vascular surgery where standard techniques are insufficient.  
TachoSil is indicated in adults for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative 
cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery (see section 5.1).” (see SmPC section 4.1). 
Epidemiology  
Based on national data from England, there were an estimated 157,046 operations in which TachoSil may 
be appropriate in a total population of 50.762 million in 2005. This extrapolates to approximately 1.519 
million operations in which TachoSil may be appropriate for the 27 countries EU population of 491.024 
million in 2005.  
Based upon data from a registry of vascular surgery activity in Spain (1996-2011), the mean number of 
vascular surgical procedures performed per hospital per year was 742 [Lozano FS et al, Monitoring the 
practice of vascular surgery: findings from a national registry (1996-2011), World J Surg 
2014;38(1):241-4]. For select vascular surgical procedures, based upon data collected from national and 
regional vascular registries from several countries in Europe, the volume or rate of reported procedures 
performed was as follows: infrainguinal bypass (2.3-24.6 per 100,000 population, 2005-2009), carotid 
artery procedures (53,077, 2005-2010), and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (40,848, 2005-2009).

Management 
Conventional procedures used to control bleeding include the use of direct pressure, sutures, pledges, 
and/or electrocautery. Absorbable haemostatic agents such as bovine gelatine power and sponges, and 
haemostatics agents made from bovine collagen and oxidised cellulose are also used for stopping 
bleeding. Additionally, products containing thrombin and/or fibrinogen are used to assist body´s natural 
clotting mechanism to achieved haemostasis. The versatility of fibrin sealant is due to its capacity to 
cause blood to clot, creating a sealing barrier as well as gluing tissues together.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
TachoSil is a ready-to-use degradable surgical patch developed for topical use to support intraoperative 
haemostasis and tissue sealing. The patch consists of a dry foamed collagen carrier of equine origin, 
coated with human fibrinogen and human thrombin. This fixed combination is intended to be applied 
directly to the wound surface. TachoSil was approved by the European Commission in 2004. 
Predecessors of TachoSil were TachoComb and TachoComb H, both containing aprotinin derived from 
bovine lung. Aprotinin was used for extending the persistence of fibrin clots. However, due to the risk of 
life-threatening anaphylaxis, and due to bovine origin, aprotinin was further disfavored (see below). 
TachoComb is marketed since 1992 in many countries; last batch was manufactured in August 2011, for 
Japan and Korea. Brand name has been kept and is still used in some former USSR countries, although 
with the new TachoSil formulation. TachoComb H was marketed amongst others in Germany and Austria 
from 2001 to 2005, replacing TachoComb; last batch was manufactured in September 2011, also for 
Japan. TachoSil stands for the currently approved formulation, approved by EMA in June 2004; synonyms 
during development were “TachoComb S” and “TachoComb TC-S”. TachoSil differs from its predecessors 
by a successive removal of bovine sourced components (bovine thrombin and bovine aprotinin) and by 
lacking the antifibrinolytic aprotinin. 
TachoSil is a further development of TachoComb and TachoComb H, which were in clinical use for several 
years in a range of countries. Some nonclinical  data on these predecessor product versions were 
transferable to the current TachoSil formulation. TachoSil differs from its predecessors by a successive 
removal of bovine sourced components (bovine thrombin and bovine aprotinin) and by lacking the 
antifibrinolytic aprotinin. Of note, the predecessor products TachoComb and TachoComb H differ from 
TachoSil in bovine components and the addition of aprotinin. Unfortunately, the brand name 
“TachoComb” has been maintained in some countries – according to the MAH despite changing the 
formulation.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No CHMP advice was sought. Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for TachoSil is not in the Scope of the 
Paediatric Regulation due to the approval date of TachoSil (2004) which was before the entry into force of 
the paediatric Regulation. 
Similar products have been subject to PIP-procedures with recommendation of controlled studies in 
paediatric subjects. 
The focus of this application is based on the following points: 
•  Available publications, reporting safety and efficacy data in patients aged 1 day to 19.8 years with 
off-label use of TachoSil; 
•  Nearly 18 years post-marketing safety and efficacy data; 
•  Cumulative exposure of over 10 million patients worldwide (as per June 2021), with a 0.013% 
incidence of adverse events; 
•  Study TC- 2402-040-SP as supporting data: a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multi-
centre trial, to compare the efficacy and safety of TachoSil versus Surgicel Original for secondary 
treatment of local bleeding in adult and paediatric patients undergoing hepatic resection surgery; 
submitted to the FDA in 2014 and based on which a paediatric indication was granted in the US. 
This study fulfilled a commitment stated in the 2010 FDA approval letter, to conduct a deferred 
paediatric study for use of TachoSil as an adjunct to haemostasis in paediatric patients 0-16 years 
undergoing hepatic resection surgery. Since 2015, TachoSil has been used in the US in patients 
from 1 month of age. 
•  Data from Study TC-019-IN, a prematurely stopped prospective, uncontrolled study in paediatric 
subjects, were also included into a pool of paediatric data 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, Fibrinogen and Thrombin are not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment in accordance with the Guideline on environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

In animal studies, TachoSil biodegrades after administration to a wound surface, with few remnants left 
after 13 weeks. Complete degradation of TachoSil was seen in some animals 12 months after its 
administration to a liver wound, whereas small remnants were still observed in others. The degradation 
was associated with infiltration of granulocytes and formation of resorptive granulation tissue 
encapsulating the degraded remnants of TachoSil. No evidence of local intolerability has been observed in 
animal studies. 
From the experience in humans, there have been isolated cases where remnants were observed as 
coincidental findings with no signs of functional impairment. Single dose toxicity studies in different 
species of animals have shown no signs of acute toxic effects.  
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of Human Fibrinogen/Human Thrombin.  
Considering the above data, Human Fibrinogen/Human Thrombin is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Biopharmacokinetics 
TachoSil is intended for topical use during surgical interventions to support vascular sealing to provide 
adjunct local haemostasis in surgery. Therefore, considerations of bioavailability do not apply. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Following contact with physiological fluids (e.g., blood, lymph), or physiological saline solution, the 
coagulation factors of the TachoSil coating dissolve and partly diffuse into the wound surface. 
Subsequently, the fibrinogen-thrombin reaction takes place, which initiates the last step of the 
coagulation cascade. Fibrinogen is converted into fibrin monomers that spontaneously polymerise into 
fibrin strands. These form a viscous and elastic clot, which attaches the patch tightly onto the wound 
surface.  
The fibrin is then cross linked by endogenous factor XIII, creating a firm, mechanically stable network 
with good adhesive properties; therefore, it provides not only haemostasis, but sealing as well, 
independent of the subject’s own coagulation system.  
Fibrin sealants/haemostatics are metabolised in the same way as endogenous fibrin, by fibrinolysis and 
phagocytosis; besides, the fibrin matrix serves as scaffolding for fibroblast migration, which is important 
for the tissue healing process. 
After moistening, the TachoSil patch becomes pliable and can be moulded to the tissue surface. TachoSil 
exhibits extensibility characteristics to accommodate for the physiological movements of tissues and 
organs.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology data were submitted as part of the current application procedure. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology data were submitted as part of the current application procedure. TachoSil 
differs from TachoComb and TachoComb H regarding Aprotinin as an additional active substance, and the 
successive replacement of bovine components. The medicinal products are therefore not considered to be 
interchangeable. This has implications on the clinical data provided below.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
No new study results have been submitted. The applicant provided a discussion on data previously 
submitted data in the scope of post-authorisation measures. 
Study TC-019-IN (hepatic resection surgery): 
Study TC-019-IN was a prospective, multi-centre, non-controlled, phase III-b study of TachoSil in 
paediatric patients scheduled for resection of the liver with or without segmental liver transplantation. For 
the primary (and only) efficacy endpoint of time to haemostasis (ITT, intention to treat population), 13 of 
16 subjects (81.3% [95% CI: 61.8-100%]) obtained haemostasis at 3 minutes after application of 
TachoSil. One subject obtained haemostasis at 8 minutes after application of TachoSil. Two subjects failed 
to achieve satisfactory haemostasis within 10 minutes, which necessitated alternative haemostatic 
measures. 
The study was halted by Takeda after a period of 16 months, and after 16 of planned 40 children had 
been enrolled. The unavailability of hospital records and the complexities of multidisciplinary critical care, 
made comprehensive and consistent data recording in the case report form (CRF) impractical, and 
monitoring, including source data verification, impossible for significant periods. These circumstances 
resulted in the late reporting of a serious adverse event (SAE). This event and the difficulty working to 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) led Takeda to halt the study. Additionally, it became apparent during this 
review that a study in this subject population would primarily collect safety data related to the underlying 
disease/procedure. The study was discontinued and the findings for the subjects included to that point 
were to be reported. 
Study TC-2402-040-SP (hepatic resection surgery, paediatric population): 
Study TC-2402-040-SP was a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multi-centre trial, to compare the 
efficacy and safety of TachoSil versus Surgicel Original for secondary treatment of local bleeding in adult 
and paediatric patients undergoing hepatic resection surgery. For the primary efficacy endpoint, the 
proportion of subjects in the paediatric FAS (Full analysis set, consisting of all 17 paediatric patients who 
were randomly assigned to treatment) who achieved haemostasis within 3 minutes was 87.5% (95% CI: 
47.3, 99.7) in the TachoSil group and 44.4% (95% CI: 13.7, 78.8) in the Surgicel Original group. For the 
paediatric FAS, the proportion of subjects who achieved haemostasis within 5 minutes was higher in the 
TachoSil group (87.5%) than in the Surgicel Original group (77.8%). 
Median (range) observed time to haemostasis was 3.0 (3, 8) minutes in the TachoSil group and 3.5 (3, 8) 
minutes in the Surgicel Original group (FAS).

Pooled Analysis 
The applicant furthermore provided a pooled analysis based on the paediatric patients from the above two 
mentioned studies TC-019-IN and TC-2402-040-SP, which is called the “Paediatric Study Pool”. A total of 
45 paediatric subjects were included in the paediatric study pool: 36 in the TachoSil group (8 randomised 
and 12 from the extension part from study TC-2402-040-SP, as well as 16 patients enrolled in TC-019-
IN) and 9 in the comparator group (from study TC-2402-040-SP, all randomised). 
Table 2: Summary of results from both paediatric populations studied in TC-2402-040-SP and 
TC-019-IN. Adult population from study TC-2402-040-SP included for comparison, FAS – full 
analysis set, SAF – safety analysis set, CI – confidence interval  
Bibliographic data 
To support the extrapolation concept, the following data sources were used:  
•  11 clinical trials from TachoSil development program: 9 prospective, randomised controlled trials 
on adult population, 1 non-interventional, prospective surveillance trial on adult population, one 
prospective, one-arm trial on paediatric population and one paediatric sub-study partly 
prospective, randomised controlled trials and partly one-arm. In total, 5246 patients were 
enrolled, of which 4223 received TachoSil treatment.  
These data were considered adequate and sufficient to gain marketing authorisation for TachoSil for adult 
population in EU and both, adult and paediatric population in USA. Paediatric trials included relatively low 
number of subjects (45 total, 36 of which received TachoSil treatment), which is expected for paediatric 
studies. The 95% confidence interval for point estimates were wide, thus the evidence from paediatric 
trials is considered limited. Ten trials were referenced to published papers, one to ClinicalTrials.gov. In 
general, these studies supported the efficacy of TachoSil, as well as superiority of TachoSil over standard 
treatment in hepatic, renal and cardiac surgeries.  
• 
Twelve (12) scientific publications confirming the use of similar class of medicinal products 
(B02BC30, local haemostatics, combinations) in paediatric population (total of 1292 children aged 
1 day to 18 years received fibrin sealant treatment).  
•  Seven papers presented retrospective chart/cases review, 2 were prospective randomised (1 
open-label, 1 double blind), 3 others were prospective studies (either open label, non-randomised 
or observational cohort study). The quality of evidence from these publications varies and is from 
low to high, depending on the study design. Overall, these studies provide evidence on the use of 
similar medicinal products in paediatric population and support its efficacy. 
• 
Fifteen (15) publications from clinical trials concerning the development of haemostatic system in 
children and similarities/differences between target and reference population. Thirteen studies 
were prospective, non-interventional, with high quality of evidence. Two other studies were 
retrospective chart review, with moderate quality of evidence. These studies showed that despite 
some differences in coagulation and anticoagulation parameters between children and adults, the 
effective haemostatic system was maintained in paediatric population and observed differences 
should be considered physiologic.

• 
• 
Three (3) publications confirming the use of TachoSil in paediatric population: one retrospective 
study and 2 case series presentation. The quality of evidence is low (case series) to moderate 
(retrospective study). The retrospective study (n=117) and one case study (n=6) concerned the 
use of TachoSil during heart surgery. 
Two (2) research articles comparing TachoSil with TachoComb: 1 randomised double blind clinical

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
TC-019-IN: 
The clinical trial report of study TC-019-IN, an open-label, non-controlled prospective, multi-centre, 
phase III-b study of TachoSil in paediatric patients scheduled for resection of the liver with or without 
segmental liver transplantation, was previously submitted in order to fulfil a post-authorisation 
commitment (Follow-up measure (FUM) 012). Respective procedure is referred to (EMEA/H/C/505, 
EU/1/04/277/001-004, 2008). 
Although fourty  children were planned to be enrolled in the study, only 16 were enrolled when the study 
was discontinued due to difficulties to comply with GCP requirements. Median age was 15 (2.5 – 147.5) 
months. The open design of the study, the application of TachoSil on graft tissue and the extremely 
severe clinical situation of the children restricted the evidence of the gained data. Due to the very small 
sample size, the 95% confidence interval for the point estimate of the proportion of obtaining 
haemostasis at 3 minutes after application of TachoSil was very wide and hence the uncertainty in the 
study results was large. Overall, a profound evaluation of efficacy could not be performed based on these 
data. No amendment to the SmPC were recommended based on the evaluation of the data in the 
respective FUM012 procedure. 
Study TC-2402-040-SP 
Study TC-2402-040-SP was a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multi-centre trial, to compare the 
efficacy and safety of TachoSil versus Surgicel Original for secondary treatment of local bleeding in adult 
and paediatric patients undergoing hepatic resection surgery. The study was subject to an Article 46 
procedure (EMEA/H/C/000505/P46 039). 
In the paediatric part including 29 subjects, 17 were randomly assigned to treatment (8 to TachoSil and 9 
to Surgicel), whereas 12 were enrolled open-label in the context of an extension trial and exclusively 
treated with TachoSil. In total 20 paediatric patients were treated with TachoSil. Age-range was 0.4 to 
13.0 years for the TachoSil group. Seventeen out of 20 paediatric subjects treated with TachoSil achieved 
haemostasis within 3 minutes after product application versus 4 (of 9) in the Surgicel-group. Median 
observed time to haemostasis was 3.0 minutes in the TachoSil group and 3.5 minutes in the Surgicel 
Original group, representing quite similar values. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133841/2023 
Page 13/28 
 
 
 
 
Also in this study, due to the small sample size (n=17), the confidence interval for the estimated 
proportion of obtaining haemostasis at 3 minutes after application of TachoSil, the primary efficacy 
endpoint, was very wide and hence the uncertainty large. 
No SmPC amendment was recommended in the respective Article 46 procedure. 
Of note, age-range was between 4 months and 13 years in this study. Data on patients aged 13-18 years 
are not available.  
Pooled Analysis 
In the so-called “integrated analysis”, the applicant just simply pooled the results of the two studies, 
without weighting or accounting for different variances in the two trails. Due to its post-hoc nature as well 
as heterogeneities in the designs of the two pooled trials, these pooled results are subject to a lot of 
uncertainty. Additionally, even after pooling, if the above-mentioned uncertainties are not taken into 
account, the confidence intervals were quite large and the pooled results did not provide any new 
evidence compared to the results of the individual studies. 
Bibliographic data: 
In total, 20 Articles from the scientific literature have been provided.  
5 Articles referred to TachoComb containing aprotinin, and therefore are not relevant for the present 
application considering the  different medicinal products. One of them covers 1633 patients with 
Tonsillectomy. One article (Krivchenia D et al) was in Russian language, containing only a brief statement 
in English language (“trust the safety and efficacy of Tachocomb platelets application in pediatric 
surgery”), and therefore difficult to consider. One article is a citation of the other (Kieran et al and Mele et 
al). One article is the publication of the FUM-study (Mirza et al). One article describes the use of TachoSil 
moistened with gentamicin, a non-approved use - therefore also not considered relevant for the current 
application. 
Two case-reports of neurosurgery described use of a combination of TachoSil with an approved fibrin glue 
– thus not providing clear evidences for TachoSil alone (Keinänen et al and Pennacchietti et al). 
Most of the remaining articles described interesting case-reports or case-series in special circumstances 
(bilateral Wilms-tumor, Cystic fibrosis, Liver transplantation, ruptured neuroblastoma), rare disease 
(Adams-Oliver-Syndrome), and specific surgical techniques (Minimally invasive procedures, intracranial 
bullet removal, neuro-navigation technique, nephron-sparing surgery, bladder-neck surgery). 
Further, experimental approaches (prevention of lymphatic leaks, necrotising enterocolitis with zebra-
technique) were presented. 
Data quality was of considerably differing levels (letter to the editor, retrospective chart reviews, single 
case-reports, prospective study – FUM-study). 
Overall, the literature compilation is considered to be interesting in the sense of surgical progress. Five 
articles and the majority of the data were collected from patients treated with TachoComb, containing 
aprotinin. Hence these data are not to be considered supportive for present TachoSil application. Specific 
clinical data in paedaitric would have been expected in line with the clinical guideline. The company was 
asked to perform an extrapolation exercise.  
Extrapolation exercise: 
Based on the review of the existing knowledge on developmental haemostasis, clinical data on TachoSil in 
adult population and limited information from paediatric patients, an extrapolation concept was developed 
and assumed that the extrapolation of efficacy and safety of TachoSil from reference population (adults) 
to target population (paediatrics) is justified. The data concerning similarities and differences regarding 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133841/2023 
Page 14/28 
 
 
 
 
the patient condition (“disease”, herein postoperative wound and process of its healing), response to 
treatment and pharmacology were reviewed and integrated and are generally considered consistent 
across sources. The differences found between target and reference population are not expected to affect 
the response to treatment. 
Since TachoSil patch is a locally applied medicinal product and the amount of the patch required to be 
applied should be adequate to the wound size and underlying clinical need for the patient, no exposure 
effect is expected to affect the outcome of a treatment. Although, patients’ weight and wound size will 
likely to be different between populations, exposure-response relationship is not expected to differ due to 
local modality of application, and adjustment the size of a patch to wound size and bleeding rate. 
Taken together, it is firstly concluded that the apparently substantial differences in haemostasis 
physiology with pronounced numerical differences in plasma levels of most haemostatic proteins and 
functional readouts provide sound justification for an exclusion of neonates (i.e. children up to 1 month of 
age) from the requested paediatric extension of indication. 
Secondly, it is noted that the question of the exact age at which the coagulation system can be regarded 
fully established cannot be answered conclusively. However, current literature supports the notion of 
most pronounced changes towards adult values within the first month of life and indicates a trend of 
stabilisation beyond the 1-month boundary. Moreover, TachoSil’s composition and its mechanism of 
action argue for a rather minor impact of the patient's own haemostatic system and the few remaining 
potentially relevant aspects of development are not considered likely to exert any significant age-related 
impact beyond the first month of life. 
Hence, overall, the proposed definition of a lower age limit of 1 month in the requested paediatric 
extension of indication (i.e. section 4.1 of the TachoSil SmPC) is considered acceptable. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Both available clinical studies with paediatric involvement (TC-019-IN, TC-2402-040-SP) rely on data 
from hepatic surgery in a narrow patient population with challenging results. Both have been submitted 
and assessed in earlier procedures (FUM and Article 46). From a biostatistics’ point of view, for both 
studies confidence intervals for the primary efficacy endpoint were very wide, and hence the uncertainty 
large. Regarding the pooled data, due to post-hoc nature and heterogeneity of the trial-designs, results 
are even more subject to uncertainty. Bibliographic data reflect a heterogeneous collection, not clearly 
covering the targeted clinical use of TachoSil. Although positive statements regarding efficacy are found 
in several publications, these data cannot replace convincing clinical-study-results according to the clinical 
guideline. 
Overall and mainly based on the extrapolation exercise the requested paediatric extension of indication is 
considered acceptable for vascular surgeries. Furthermore, it has been agreed on a brief reflection of 
available paediatric data in section 5.1 and removal of the statement “TachoSil is not recommended for 
use in children below age 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.” in section 4.2 of the 
TachoSil SmPC

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The MAH presented a pooled safety analysis. 36 paediatric patients have been exposed to TachoSil in 
clinical studies (TC-2402-040-SP and TC-019-IN). 
Patient exposure 
In the study pool of 45 paediatric subjects, 36 (8 randomised, 28 open label) were accounted to the 
TachoSil group and 9 (randomized) to the Comparator group. The majority of paediatric subjects used ≤1 
patch (25 [69.4%]) or >1 to 2 patches (8 [22.2%]). The minimum number of patches used in a single 
paediatric subject was 0.25 and the maximum in a subject treated with TachoSil was 2 patches. 
Age range in the TachoSil group was 0-13 years. 
Adverse events 
The majority of subjects in both treatment groups experienced TEAEs that were considered mild or 
moderate in intensity, all of which were considered not related to study treatment. Incidence of severe 
adverse events was approximately the same across treatment groups and only 20 of 272 total adverse 
events were considered severe. 
Serious adverse event (SAE)/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs were reported by 17 of 34 subjects in the TachoSil group and 4 of 9 subjects in the Comparator 
group. No subjects in either treatment group experienced an SAE that was considered related to study 
treatment. 
Events of special interest (ESI) were presented for the paediatric study pool in comparison to the 
comparator Surgicel. 
Table 3: Overall summary of subjects with ESIs by treatment (paediatric study pool) 
More thrombotic/embolic events and postoperative bleedings were seen in the TachoSil-group. Tissue 
adhesions were similar.

Immunogenicity testing and viral serology was not performed in paediatric subjects up to 6 months of 
age, nor for subjects enrolled in the paediatric extension part. Immunogenicity was tested in 2 children 
treated with TachoSil and 2 children treated with Surgicel. Only 1 paediatric subject had a 1-month 
follow-up test, which was negative for antibodies. 
Immunological adverse events:  
Table 4: Subjects with ESIs by preferred term and treatment (paediatric study pool) 
Immunological events in the TachoSil population cover a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms – including 
respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular, and named drug hypersensitivity. On the comparator side, 1 
subject was reported with a rash – considered to be a multi-causal symptom. 
Two fatal outcomes after TachoSil treatment were submitted as follows: 
(1) A 3-year-old boy treated with TachoSil in Study TC-019-IN had a fatal event of multi-organ failure 
that began on Day of Surgery and ended 62 days post-dose and was considered not related to study 
treatment by the investigator. The subject had concurrent metabolic acidosis, decrease haemoglobin, 
decrease sodium, decrease potassium, ascites, renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, pleural effusion, 
abdominal bleeding, disseminating intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), respiratory distress, and sepsis. 
(2) A 6-month-old girl treated with TachoSil in Study TC-2402-040-SP had a fatal event of exsanguination 
that began and ended 42 days post-dose and was considered not related to study treatment by the 
investigator. The subject had a concurrent illness of end stage renal disease and hyperoxaluria as well as 
concurrent adverse events of hepatic necrosis, portal vein thrombosis, septic shock, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, Stenotrophomonas infection, Enterobacter infection, Mycobacterium abscess 
infection, anastomotic complication, and splenic rupture. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the paediatric study pool, 6 subjects discontinued the study: 4 out of 35 subjects in the TachoSil- and 
2 out of 9 subjects in the Comparator-group. 4 subjects (2 in each group) were lost to follow-up or had 
“other” reasons for discontinuation. 2 subjects from the TachoSil group discontinued due to death or 
Adverse event.

Up to 08 June 2021, a total of 1,283 spontaneously worldwide reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
have been received; 556 ADRs were considered serious, and 713 ADRs were considered non serious. The 
review of post-marketing cumulative data revealed no new safety concerns and no amendments of the 
product labelling for safety are considered necessary at this time. 
Bibliographic data: 
One article (Ekici et al) is considered to be of special interest regarding safety: The article described a 3 
year-old girl presenting with spinal cord “tumour”. From her medical history it was learned that she was 
operated on cervical meningocele during her neonatal period with use of TachoComb due to 
CerebroSpinal Fluid (CSF) leakage. At the age of 3 years a “tumour” was removed. Histologically the 
whole mass constituted a foreign body reaction against TachoComb for dural repair.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Beyond the safety-analyses from the preceding procedures, pooled safety-analyses have been presented. 
Safety-data were pooled from both above described studies. Overall numbers are low (36 TachoSil-, and 
9 Surgicel-treated subjects), and results are difficult to interpret due to various confounding factors. Most 
of the patients were enrolled open-label. Comparative design applies only for 8 TachoSil-treated subjects. 
SAEs were reported by 17 of 34 subjects in the TachoSil group and 4 of 9 subjects in the Comparator 
group. No subject in either treatment group experienced an SAE that was considered related to study 
treatment. 
Evaluation of ESIs revealed more thrombotic/embolic events and postoperative bleedings in the TachoSil-
group. Tissue adhesions were similar for TachoSil and Comparator. However, no conclusions should be 
drawn from such low numbers. Two fatal case-reports concern the TachoSil group – both outcomes not 
related with the TachoSil treatment. 
Immunogenicity testing was not done sufficiently. Pattern of adverse events on potential immunological/ 
allergic reactions seem to be in favour of Surgicel. However, all events were reported for single patients, 
only – precluding valid comparisons. 
Low patient numbers in age-group-related subgroup-analyses similarly are considered to be challenging 
and do not allow valid conclusions. Of note, TachoSil patient-group covers the age of 0-13 years – 
bearing a gap from 13 to 18 years to the adult studies. As this adolescent age-group represents a phase 
of significant growth and maturation of organs and body-systems, this gap is considered to be relevant. 
In summary, safety evaluation of clinical-study-data does not allow valid conclusions, mainly due to low 
patient numbers. 
Bibliographic data: 
The article (Ekici et al) described a 3 year-old girl presenting with spinal cord “tumour”. From her medical 
history it was learned that she was operated on cervical meningocele during her neonatal period with use 
of TachoComb due to CerebroSpinal Fluid (CSF) leakage. At the age of 3 years a “tumour” was removed. 
Histologically the whole mass constituted a foreign body reaction against TachoComb for dural repair. The 
causative collagen-sponge in TachoComb is the same as in TachoSil, and the described reaction is at least 
clinically plausible. Therefore, the following statement has been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC: “Some 
cases of product residue, that might have caused a foreign-body reaction in the form of granuloma, have 
been reported.” 
In order to improve the safety monitoring of TachoSil and to collect additional safety information in the 
paediatric population, a non-interventional post-authorisation study is warranted and the company is 
asked to submit a variation to update the RMP strictly according to the latest EU-RMP template, including 
part V.3, and to include a cat. 3 PASS protocol, by August 2023. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the safety data provided, the paediatric extension of indication can be recommended in the 
following indication: TachoSil is indicated in adults and children from 1 month of age for supportive 
treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis, to promote tissue sealing and for suture support in 
vascular surgery where standard techniques are insufficient.  
It was agreed not to recommend the paedaitric extension of indication for supportive sealing of the dura 
mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery.

A bibliographical case-report on histologically proven foreign-body-reaction-granuloma 3 years after dura-
repair raises concern. Therefore, the following statement warning has been added in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC: “Some cases of product residue, that might have caused a foreign-body reaction in the form of 
granuloma, have been reported.”  
In order to improve the safety monitoring of TachoSil and to collect additional safety information in the 
paediatric population, a non-interventional post-authorisation study is warranted and the company is 
asked to submit a variation to update the RMP strictly according to the latest EU-RMP template, including 
part V.3, and to include a cat. 3 PASS protocol, by August 2023. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 9.0 is acceptable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH included editorial changes to the 
product information which are acceptable. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH has applied for the following paediatric indication: “TachoSil is indicated in adults and children 
aged 1month to 18 years for supportive treatment in surgery, for improvement of haemostasis, to 
promote tissue sealing, for suture support in vascular surgery where standard techniques are insufficient, 
and for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following 
neurological surgery (see section 5.1).” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
At present, none of the centrally approved fibrin sealants has yet received an authorisation for patients 
<18 years of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133841/2023 
Page 23/28 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
No new study-results have been submitted. Previously submitted data include results from clinical studies 
TC-019-IN and TC-2402-040-SP. Bibliographical data have also been provided as well as an extrapolation 
exercise.  
3.1.4.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy is mainly based on the extrapolation exercise. TachoSil patch is a locally applied medicinal 
product and the amount of the patch required to be applied should be adequate to the wound size and 
underlying clinical need for the patient, no exposure effect is expected to affect the outcome of a 
treatment. Although, patients’ weight and wound size will likely to be different between populations, 
exposure-response relationship is not expected to differ due to local modality of application, and 
adjustment the size of a patch to wound size and bleeding rate. 
The apparently substantial differences in haemostasis physiology with pronounced numerical differences 
in plasma levels of most haemostatic proteins and functional readouts provide sound justification for an 
exclusion of neonates (i.e. children up to 1 month of age) from the requested paediatric extension of 
indication. 
Secondly, it is noted that the question of the exact age at which the coagulation system can be regarded 
fully established cannot be answered conclusively. However, current literature supports the notion of 
most pronounced changes towards adult values within the first month of life and indicates a trend of 
stabilisation beyond the 1-month boundary. Moreover, TachoSil’s composition and its mechanism of 
action argue for a rather minor impact of the patient's own haemostatic system and the few remaining 
potentially relevant aspects of development are not considered likely to exert any significant age-related 
impact beyond the first month of life. 
3.1.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The submitted data do not provide an appropriate evidence base for serving as a stand-alone paediatric 
development. Both available clinical studies (TC-019-IN, TC-2402-040-SP) rely on a narrow patient 
population. Provided clinical-study data have been submitted in previous procedures (FUM and Article 46) 
and reveal challenging results due to a severely ill patent collective (TC-019-IN) and low patient 
numbers. From a biostatistics point of view, for both studies, confidence intervals for the primary efficacy 
endpoint were very wide, and hence the uncertainty large. Regarding the pooled data, due to post-hoc 
nature and heterogeneity of the trial-designs, results are even more subject to uncertainty. 
Moreover, clinical study data are limited to a paediatric age-range of 0-13 years leaving a relevant gap in 
knowledge with regard to the treatment of adolescents, which due to significant growth and maturation of 
organs and body-systems may represent a particularly challenging age-group. 
The presented bibliographic data reflect a heterogeneous collection, not clearly targeting the approved 
clinical use of TachoSil. No robust efficacy-data are reflected in these reports. Although individual positive 
statements regarding efficacy are found in several publications, these data cannot replace convincing 
clinical-study-results. 
3.1.  Unfavourable effects 
A published case-report on a clinically relevant cervical tumour formation (i.e. a histologically proven 
foreign-body granuloma) in a 3-year-old child that had been treated with TachoSil for dura repair led to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/133841/2023 
Page 24/28 
 
 
 
 
the identification of multiple post-marketing reports of incomplete bio-resorption and foreign-body 
granuloma formation upon TachoSil treatment. Even though the majority of these reports concerned 
adults and cases were apparently not limited to neurosurgical procedures, the only limited amount of 
available data precludes drawing conclusions with regard to potential impacts of patient age and / or 
therapeutic indication. However, the risk of granuloma formation is considered particularly relevant in the 
context of anatomically confined spaces (e.g. neurosurgery) and the immunological basis of this foreign-
body reaction may suggest a possible impact of patient age. Given its potential clinical relevance and the 
clear relationship to an incomplete bio-resorption of TachoSil material, foreign-body granuloma formation 
has been added as an identified risk of TachoSil treatment and hence a statement has been included in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
3.1.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Pooled safety-data from both above described studies cover 36 TachoSil- and 9 Comparator- (Surgicel-) 
treated subjects. However, data-pool is considered to be narrow and heterogeneous. No valid information 
is available on immunogenicity. However, no specific additional risk has been identified.  
In order to improve the safety monitoring of TachoSil and to collect additional safety information in the 
paediatric population, a non-interventional post-authorisation study is warranted and the company is 
asked to submit a variation to update the RMP strictly according to the latest EU-RMP template, including 
part V.3, and to include a cat. 3 PASS protocol, by August 2023. 
3.2.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.2.1.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The MAH performed a paediatric extrapolation exercise which provided additional support for i) the 
expectation of an age-independent pharmacological (i.e. haemostatic) activity of TachoSil beyond the first 
month of life and ii) an age-independent treatment effect in the context of hepatic resection.  
However, particularly due to remaining concerns with regard to its use for dura repair in neurosurgery, 
the presented evidence base was not considered appropriate to justify a paediatric extension across the 
entire spectrum of currently approved indications in adults, as originally proposed by the MAH. 
A paediatric extension of indication from 1 month of age, restricted to the product’s use for tissue sealing 
and vascular surgery (i.e. excluding its use for dura mater repair in neurosurgery) has been considered 
acceptable.  
Foreign-body granuloma formation has been added as an identified risk of TachoSil treatment and hence 
a statement has been included in section 4.8 of the  SmPC. In order to improve the safety monitoring of 
TachoSil and to collect additional safety information in the paediatric population, a non-interventional 
post-authorisation study is warranted and the company is asked to submit a variation to update the RMP 
strictly according to the latest EU-RMP template, including part V.3, and to include a cat. 3 PASS protocol, 
by August 2023.

3.3.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of TachoSil is positive for this paediatric extension of indication for supportive treatment 
in surgery for improvement of haemostasis, to promote tissue sealing and for suture support in vascular 
surgery where standard techniques are insufficient.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 
10 March 2023. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA 
website at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-agencies/european-
medicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-confidential-information_en.pdf 
In addition, should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains personal data, please 
provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in “track changes” and 
with detailed justification by 10 March 2023. We would like to remind you that, according to Article 
4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) ‘personal data’ 
means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the ‘data subject’). 
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by 
reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online 
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, 
cultural or social identity of that natural person. 
It is important to clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that the 
personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional 
information (e.g. key-coded data).  
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data 
which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for 
instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. 
information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable 
individual.” 
2. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, if there will be one within 2 months from adoption of the CHMP Opinion, or 
prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. If the Commission Decision will be adopted 
within 12 months from CHMP Opinion, the closing sequence should be submitted within 30 days 
after the Opinion. For additional guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for 
eCTD Submissions in the EU. 
3. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the 
RMP ‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the MAH 
is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the ‘Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the 
receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, 
headers and footers.

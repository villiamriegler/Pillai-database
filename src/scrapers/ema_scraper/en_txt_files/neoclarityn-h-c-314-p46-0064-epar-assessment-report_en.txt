1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
It concerns a submission according to the P-46 article of the EU Paediatric Regulation (EC No 
1901/2006) i.e. the results of two clinical studies (P201 – P202) conducted in Japan with desloratadine 
as these studies included subjects that were younger than 18 years old. 
These studies are not being submitted in support of a new pediatric indication for desloratadine in the 
EU.

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure P46-064  
P201 
Study design: multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to 
study the safety and efficacy of desloratadine (DL) tablets in Japanese subjects 12 years and older with 
chronic urticaria.  
Participants: 239 randomized subjects, including 11 subjects 12-17 years of age  
Study medication: after the screening period, subjects meeting all eligibility criteria received study 
treatment orally for 2 weeks in a double-blinded manner. They were randomized to one of 3 
treatments: 
  DL 10 mg once daily (10 mg group) 
  DL 5 mg once daily (5 mg group)  
 
Placebo once daily (placebo group)  
Primary efficacy endpoint: change from baseline in sum of pruritus/itch (either day- or nighttime 
whichever was higher than the other) and rash (overall assessment of rash) scores, as assessed by the 
(sub-) investigator at Week 2.

Efficacy Results: Primary endpoint: 
Conclusion on efficacy:  
The change from baseline in the primary endpoint sum score of pruritus/itch (either day- or nighttime 
whichever was higher than the other) and rash was statistically significantly superior in the DL 10 mg 
group and the DL 5 mg group compared to the placebo group, demonstrating superiority of both DL 
groups over the placebo group.  
Safety Results  
The incidence of adverse events was 30.0% (24/80 subjects) for DL 5 mg group, 22.8% 
(18/79 subjects) for DL 10 mg group and 20.3% (16/79 subjects) for placebo group.  
The incidence of drug-related adverse events was 8.8% (7/80 subjects) for DL 5 mg group, 13.9% 
(11/79 subjects) for DL 10 mg group and 2.5% (2/79 subjects) for placebo group.

The incidence of drug-related somnolence was generally low: 3.8% (3/80) in DL 5 mg, 6.3% 
(5/79) in DL 10 mg and 2.5% (2/79) in the placebo group. Recovery occurred during the study drug 
treatment period or within 2 days from the final dose. 
No serious adverse events or deaths were reported.  
The incidence of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 0.0% for the DL 5 mg 
group, 0.0% for DL 10 mg group and 2.5% (2/79 subjects) for placebo group i.e. because of 
dermatitis contact and seasonal allergy.  
One of the subjects 12-17 years old experienced 2 non serious adverse events, that were mild in 
intensity and resolved after completion of treatment i.e. pyrexia and nasopharyngitis. The investigator 
considered these events to be unrelated to the study drug. 
Conclusion on safety: 
DL 10 mg and 5 mg administered once daily for 14 days were generally safe and well-tolerated. 
P202 
Study design: multi-center, open-label long-term Phase III trial to study the safety and efficacy of 
desloratadine (DL) tablets in Japanese subjects 12 years and older with eczema/dermatitis and dermal 
pruritus who were treated up to 8 to 12 weeks.  
Participants: 94 enrolled and treated subjects, including 10 subjects 12-17 years of age in the 
eczema/dermatitis group and 4 in the dermal pruritus group. 
Study medication: after the screening period, subjects meeting all eligibility criteria received open-
label DL 5 mg once daily in an unblinded way.  
After 4 weeks, an up-titration to DL up to 10 mg once daily was possible if the (sub-)investigator 
judged there was insufficient anti-pruritic efficacy and no safety concern. Only one dose increase was 
allowed from Week 4 (Visit 6) to Week 8 (Visit 8).  
When DL was increased, the higher dose was maintained, but if the (sub-)investigator determined that 
there was a safety concern of the subject, dose reduction to DL 5 mg/day was allowed, depending on 
symptoms and the degree of severity of itching. After a dose reduction, no new increase of the dose 
was allowed. 
Primary efficacy endpoint: change from baseline in the sum pruritus/itch scores (day- and nighttime), 
as assessed by the (sub-) investigator at Week 2. 
Efficacy Results: Primary endpoint: 
Conclusion on efficacy:  
A significant improvement from baseline in the primary endpoint sum score of pruritus/itch (sum of 
day- and nighttime) was observed both in the eczema/dermatitis group and the dermal pruritus group.  
However, the significance of these data is limited as it concerned an open-label trial.

Safety Results  
The incidence of adverse events was 53.8% (35/65 subjects) in the eczema/dermatitis group and 
48.3% (14/29 subjects) in the dermal pruritus group.  
The incidence of drug-related adverse events was 10.8% (7/65 subjects) in the eczema/dermatitis 
group and 3.4% (1/29 subjects) in the dermal pruritus group.  
The most commonly reported drug-related adverse event was somnolence: 6.2% (4/65 subjects) in 
the eczema/dermatitis group, 0.0% (0/29 subjects) in the dermal pruritus group; all of them resolved 
during the study drug administration.  
No serious drug-related adverse events or deaths were reported.  
One serious adverse event of mild skin neoplasm requiring hospitalization was reported in 1 subject 
in the eczema/dermatitis group which was considered as unrelated to study drug. The subject was 
recovered after surgical removal of the neoplasm.  
Other AEs leading to discontinuation included acarodermatitis, gastroenteritis, and headache (in 
one subject each) in the eczema/dermatitis group and asteatotic eczema and back pain (in one subject 
each) in the dermal pruritus group. Among them, only the asteatotic eczema was considered as a 
drug-related AE. The event was mild and resolved after the discontinuation of the study drug. 
Dose increase 
The dose of the study drug was increased to 10 mg once daily after Week 4 in 66 of 94 subjects 
(47 in the eczema/dermatitis group and 19 in the dermal pruritus group) in the trial. The 
incidence of an AE with and without dose up-titration in the groups was 51.5% (34/66 
subjects) and 53.6% (15/28 subjects), respectively. Drug-related AEs developing after 
increased dose included laboratory adverse events in 3 subjects, one of whom was associated with 
dose reduction due to increased hepatic enzymes. All events were mild and resolved after 
completion of treatment. 
In the eczema/dermatitis group, 6 of the subjects 12-17 years old experienced 9 non serious adverse 
events, most were mild in intensity and all resolved during study drug administration.  
In the dermal pruritus group, 2 of the subjects 12-17 years old experienced 2 non serious adverse 
events, all were mild in intensity and most resolved during study drug administration.  
The investigator considered all of these events to be unrelated to the study drug.

Conclusion on safety: 
DL 10 mg (increased dose) and 5 mg administered once daily for up to 8 to 12 weeks days were 
generally safe and well-tolerated. 
Assessment of the necessity for an update of the EU SmPC: 
The 2 discussed studies (P201 and P202) have provided limited additional data on the efficacy and 
safety of desloratadine in a total of 25 subjects that were 12-17 years old.  
The SmPC already contains the following information in this context: 
 
 
4.2 “There is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in 
adolescents 12 through 17 years of age”. 
5.1 “The efficacy of Aerius/Azomyr/Neoclarityn has not been clearly demonstrated in trials 
with adolescent patients 12 through 17 years of age.” 
The results of the study are covered by what is already mentioned in the SmPC about the efficacy of 
desloratadine in adolescent patients. Therefore, it is concluded that no update to the EU SmPC is 
necessary.

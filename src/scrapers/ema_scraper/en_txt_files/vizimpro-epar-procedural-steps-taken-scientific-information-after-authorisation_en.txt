SmPC and PL 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Vizimpro in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, 
Based on results of study A7471058, a dedicated hepatic 
Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order 
PL 
Vizimpro, dacomitinib exposure was unchanged for AUCinf 
Labelling and 
impairment trial, following a single oral dose of 30 mg 
to revise the dosing recommendation for patients 
with hepatic impairment and include relevant 
pharmacokinetics data based on results of Study 
A7471058, evaluating the effect of severe hepatic 
impairment on the plasma PK, safety and tolerability 
after a single dose of dacomitinib. As a consequence, 
the MAH is proposing to remove the missing 
information “Safety in Patient with Severe Hepatic 
Impairment” from the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP v2.0. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 10.1. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
and increased by 31% for Cmax in subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C; N=8), when 
compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (N=8). 
As a consequence, the starting dose of Vizimpro should be 
adjusted to 30 mg once daily in patients with severe (Child-
Pugh class C) hepatic impairment. The dose may be 
increased to 45 mg once daily based on individual safety 
and tolerability after at least 4 weeks of treatment.

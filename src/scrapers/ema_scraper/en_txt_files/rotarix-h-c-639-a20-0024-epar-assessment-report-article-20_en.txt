1.  Background information on the procedure 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) was made aware on 15 March 2010 by the marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) of Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK Biologicals), of new 
information regarding the unexpected presence of a non-pathogenic viral strain of porcine circovirus 1 
(PCV-1) DNA in its rotavirus vaccine. The detection of PCV-1 was not part of the product specifications 
routine screening and was done using an analytical detection method (metagenomics analysis, with 
pyrosequencing) which was not part of the current control method used; this was initially reported in a 
research paper1.  
The matter was discussed at the March 2010 Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
plenary meeting. On 22 March 2010 the Agency informed the European Commission that further in-
depth analysis of this issue were appropriate.  
In view of the above the European Commission initiated on 23 March 2010 a procedure under Article 
20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The European Commission requested the CHMP to assess the 
impact of the above findings on the quality of Rotarix, and to give its opinion on measures necessary 
to ensure the quality of this product, and on whether the marketing authorisation for this product 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or withdrawn. 
The Vaccine and Biologics Working Parties were consulted for the assessment of this procedure, as 
appropriate. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
Rotarix (rotavirus vaccine, live) is a live attenuated vaccine indicated for the active immunisation of 
infants from the age of 6 weeks for prevention of gastro-enteritis due to rotavirus infection; Rotarix is 
administered orally. Rotarix safety profile has been established based on placebo controlled clinical 
trials data, including monitoring of non serious and serious adverse events. More than 100 000 
subjects have been included in clinical trials, of which over 50 000 subjects received Rotarix in over 20 
trials. It is estimated that over 68 million infants have been exposed to this vaccine.  
The initial evidence indicated that Rotarix vaccine had been tested positive for PCV-1 DNA. The data 
suggested that the PCV-1 DNA could also be present in the Vero working cell bank (WCB) and the 
working virus seed (WSV).  
PCV-1 is a small (<20 nm), non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus of the Circoviridae family. 
Mammalian circovirus include only two closely related species (PCV-1 and PCV-2), infecting pigs. PCV 
type 1 is widespread in swine and the virus has not been linked to any animal or human disease. PCV-
1 is highly prevalent in healthy pigs, thus human dietary and respiratory exposure to this virus is likely 
to be common through pork consumption and/or inhalation of particles from pig faeces in the swine 
industry.  
In order to investigate the unexpected presence of PCV in Rotarix, several experiments were initiated. 
The evaluation focused mainly on investigating the root cause, determining the nature and the content 
in PCV-1 DNA or viral particles and their infectivity, identifying in which batches PCV-1 had been 
detected, and if those had been used for vaccination, seroconversion data was to be provided. Efforts 
also included establishing plans to remove PCV-1 from the vaccine.  
2.1.  Assessment of the impact of the PCV-1 finding on Rotarix 
2.1.1 PCV-1 detection and potential root cause 
PCV-1 presence was investigated in several stages of development, from the routine manufacturing 
process to preparation of current seed materials. Clinical trial and commercial lots were also tested.

The results confirmed that HRV (human rotavirus) strain  in parent material was negative but at 
passages upstreamfrom the HRV Master seed, PCV-1 DNA was detected. All starting materials and 
clinical lots showed the presence of PCV-1 DNA, which indicates that PCV-1 has been present from 
early stages of the Rotarix production process.  
The origin of the confirmed PCV-1 presence in Rotarix was investigated, and it is likely that PCV was 
introduced into the manufacturing process during HRV strain passages. Rotarix is manufactured using 
raw materials of animal origin (e.g., trypsin, gelatin derived amino acids). Based on available data, the 
source of PCV-1 was most probably the porcine-derived trypsin or animal-derived amino acids used to 
produce starting materials from which Rotarix vaccine is derived, including the Vero Master Cell Bank 
(Vero MCB). Current testing guidelines have been followed and the quality of porcine trypsin used 
today by the MAH in commercial vaccine production is guaranteed by strict sourcing conditions 
(porcine pancreas from USA and Canada) and a testing program for potential adventitious viruses, 
bacterial or fungal contaminations. Prior to gamma irradiation, all the porcine trypsin batches are 
submitted to the specific virological testing. At present, a test to screen each new trypsin lot for PCV 
will be developed by the MAH. However, it cannot be excluded that the (non-irradiated) porcine trypsin 
used for the establishment of the Vero MCB (in 1983) contained PCV-1. Therefore, the potential root 
cause of PCV-1 presence is likely related with the development of the vaccine, leading to PCV-1 
material to be present in the vaccine lots produced.  
To confirm the identity of the circovirus genetic material detected, sequencing analysis were 
performed. Results were compared with known sequences of PCV-1, PCV-2, DCV (duck circovirus) and 
BCV (bovine circovirus). Identity with PCV-1 was demonstrated at all tested steps of the rotavirus 
production process (Vero WCB, HRV seed, harvest, final container). An alignment of the PCV-1 
nucleotidic sequences found in the rotavirus vaccine manufacturing process with the consensus wild 
type PCV-1 sequence was performed. The results confirmed that PCV-1 DNA was present.  
2.1.2 Serology and stool samples 
Since the probable root cause pre-dates the establishing of the master cell bank, clinical lots used for 
phase III clinical trials and commercial vaccine lots from both lyophilised and liquid formulation contain 
PCV-1 material and have been used for vaccination. Therefore, seroconversion data and stool from 
vaccinated subjects were analysed.  
Blinded retrospective laboratory evaluations to assess serologic response to PCV-1 in infants aged 6 to 
12 weeks following administration of Rotarix was performed. Serum samples collected at pre-
determined time points (pre-vaccination and post dose 2 or 3) from a subset of subjects who 
participated in clinical studies with Rotarix were tested. Randomised, blinded, placebo controlled 
clinical trials was selected in order to be able to differentiate between an immune response due to 
PCV-1 present in the study vaccine (HRV group) or any potential natural PCV-1 exposure (placebo 
group). The immune response to PCV-1 was assessed using antibodies against PCV-1.

2 Rota -048: phase II, double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled study with 4 parallel groups. Subjects received 2 doses 
of either liquid or lyophilised formulation of HRV vaccine, or the respective placebo formulation, according to a 0, 1 month 
schedule given to healthy infants previously uninfected with HRV and aged 2 months (6 to 12 weeks) at the time of first 
vaccination. This study had been previously assessed in the context of a Line Extension.  
3 Rota-039: evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of Rotarix when the vaccine was used in conditions 
different from the recommendations: i.e. when not reconstituted with buffer or when stored for 7 days at 37°C before 
administration. In addition, the effect of feeding was explored when the vaccine was reconstituted with and without buffer, 
though stored at recommended temperature. This study had been previously assessed in the context of a follow-up 
measure.

Results showed that: 
Study Rota-048 
The stool from one infant in the HRV group tested positive for PCV DNA at Day 7 post-vaccination, the 
earliest time point evaluated in the study, and negative at Day 15. The DNA sequence analysis 
confirmed that the PCV DNA detected had a sequence identical to the PCV-1 sequence present in 
Rotarix. One infant in Rota-048 had an inconclusive Q-PCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) 
result at Day 7.  
Study Rota-039:  
The stool from one infant in the HRV group tested positive for PCV DNA at Day 7 post-vaccination, the 
earliest time point evaluated in the study, and negative at Day 15. The DNA sequence analysis 
confirmed that the PCV DNA detected had a sequence identical to the PCV-1 sequence present in 
Rotarix. 
Study Rota-033:  
The stools from two infants in the HRV group tested positive for PCV DNA at Day 3. In one of these 
infants, the sample at Day 7 was inconclusive and in the other infant, the sample at Day 7 was 
negative. DNA sequence analysis at Day 3 confirmed that the DNA detected had a sequence identical 
to the PCV-1 sequence present in Rotarix. In the placebo group, one infant had PCV DNA detected by 
Q-PCR at Day 15. However the DNA sequence analysis was negative and did not confirm PCV-1 
sequences. Two other subjects in the placebo group had inconclusive Q-PCR results at Day 15 and 30. 
Study Rota-022:  
No PCV DNA was detected in the stools of any of the HIV-positive infants who received Rotarix.  
None of the infants showed evidence of PCV-1 seroconversion.

2.1.3 Special patient groups and medication errors  
The Committee considered also data from special patient groups, e.g. immunocompromised infants, 
and data available from medication errors (parental instead or oral administration).  
Clinical trial data of the study including HIV-positive infants (study rota 022, see above) were reviewed 
as immune suppression could favour the development of opportunistic infections. In this trial 50 
subjects received HRV and 50 received placebo. Reactogenicity, safety and immunogenicity results 
were compared and the incidence of fever, vomiting or diarrhoea within the 15-day post-vaccination 
period was not significantly different between groups. The reactogenicity and safety profile of the HRV 
group appeared similar to the placebo group. There were 15 fatal cases (6 subjects in the HRV group 
and 9 subjects in the placebo group) reported. A review of the solicited, unsolicited and serious 
adverse events reported, did not suggest any association between Rotarix and a hypothetical human 
PCV infection among these subjects. In fact, no adverse events were found to be significantly more 
frequently reported among immunocompromised subjects who received Rotarix vaccine compared to 
the placebo. The only adverse event for which a numerical significant difference was noteworthy was 
upper respiratory infections occurring at a frequency of 14.2 % in the Rotarix group and 9.9% in the 
placebo group. This event is not expected to be related to the presence of Rotavirus or PCV-1 in the 
vaccine.

A review of the available spontaneous adverse event reports received for infants with a medical history 
of immune-suppression (three cases) was performed. The review of these cases did not reveal any 
signals suggestive of hypothetical PCV-1 infection or development of opportunistic infections. 
Regarding the accidental parental instead of oral administration of Rotarix, 347 spontaneous reports of 
accidental occurrences of parenteral administration were reviewed. Among these reports, 100 
mentioned an associated adverse event. Ten of these events were considered serious. In the remaining 
ninety non-serious reports, 161 events were reported. The review of these cases of inadequate 
administration did not reveal any signals suggestive of hypothetical PCV infection. 
2.1.4 Infectivity assays  
The number of PCV-1 DNA copies per cell were measured using Q-PCR  on the master cell bank MCB, 
on the working cell bank and at different cell passages before inoculation of the rotavirus in order to 
understand if and when PCV-1 replication occurred. The results showed that Vero cells at production 
passage contain 3000 times more PCV DNA copies when compared to the WCB. This data showed that 
PCV-1 is able to replicate in Vero cells. The load of PCV material measured by Q-PCR in the successive 
manufacturing steps decreased from the HRV working seed to the single harvest. The results suggest 
that a replicative activity is present, mainly during cell substrate preparation when the cells are in the 
exponential phase of growth..  
Vero and PK15 cell line studies 
Cell culture assays were developed in order to evaluate the presence of PCV-1 replication-competent 
particles in the Rotarix test samples. A step wise approach was followed based on the availability of the 
required cells and reagents.  
Initially tests to ascertain the presence of competent viral particles included reverse transcriptase (RT) 
PCR, which was performed to detect the presence of circovirus RNA. The experiment was conducted to 
verify if DNA sequences of PCV-1 detected in Rotarix could be amplified during the vaccine production 
process. A Q-RT-PCR assay  was used to detect mRNAs in nucleic acid material extracted from both the 
Vero cell bank and from Rotarix harvest. The results indicated that most of the PCV-1 RT-PCR signal 
was derived from DNA targets rather than RNA targets. 
Experiments were then also developed to provide data on possible presence of PCV-1 viral proteins or 
viral particles in the different stages of the manufacturing process and in different batches of the final 
vaccines.  
Test samples (Vero cells, neutralised HRV harvest and neutralised final container vaccine) were 
inoculated into PCV-1 free Vero cells, known as a permissive cell line. Neutralisation was achieved 
using a mixture of two HRV-specific monoclonal antibodies.  
The same test samples were also inoculated into PK15 (porcine kidney) cells. This cell line is also 
recognised to efficiently support the replication of porcine circovirus.  
Vero or PK-15 cells were seeded in flasks and inoculated with test samples.. The flasks were incubated 
with regular cells passages. At each passage, cells were collected and the presence of PCV-1 
transcripts was tested by reverse transcriptase RT-Q-PCR assay.  
In addition, Vero cells from the first or second passage were seeded into microplates for 
immunofluorescence readout., in order to detect the presence of PCV-1  
The detection of PCV-1 transcriptional activity and immunostained Vero cells during the infectivity 
assay suggested that replication of PCV-1 on Vero cells is occurring. Results up to the third passage of 
the infectivity assay using the RT-Q-PCR readouts are presented below for Vero and PK-15 cells. The 
assay was stopped after the third passage considering that positive results were consistently 
demonstrated 9 days post-inoculation and after three cell passages. 
At Day 0, a few mRNA transcripts were detected in the positive control (cells incubated for 2 hours 
with 103 CCID50
 from a PCV-1 viral stock). The high threshold cycle (Ct) suggests that the amount of 
mRNA in the positive control is low. This result is most probably due to the presence of residual mRNA 
in the inoculum. No transcriptional activity was detected in the negative control or in cells inoculated 
with the test samples. 
Up to the third passage, PCV-1 transcriptional activity was detected in the positive controls and in 
purified bulk test samples. These results confirm the presence of transcriptional activity in HRV purified 
bulk.

Positive (31.8) 
A first evaluation of the PCV-1 titre in HRV harvest samples was performed on Vero cell substrate after 
immunoperoxidase staining using an anti-PCV-1 pig polyclonal antibody as primary antibody. This first 
evaluation led to conclude to a titre of maximum 3 CCID50 per final container, considering the titre of 
102 CCID50/ml obtained on a pool of HRV harvests and considering the dilution factor which should be 
applied in order to reach the targeted vaccine dose in the final container vaccine. A second estimate of 
the PCV-1 titre in purified bulks was deduced from the infectivity assay conducted on Vero and PK-15 
cells and using RT-PCR as readout. This estimate was based on the comparable results obtained for the 
HRV purified bulk sample (1500 dose-equivalent) and the positive PCV-1 control titrated at 1000 
CCID50. It is recognised that the read-out assay used in this determination does not allow accurate 
quantification of the PCV-1 transcripts, however the MAH considered that comparison with the positive 
control allowed to conclude that the PCV-1 load as expressed in CCID50 and present in the HRV 
purified bulk test sample was at the same level than the PCV-1 positive control, leading to an 
estimated virus load of maximum 1 CCID50 per vaccine dose.  
In addition to these results, two sets of titration results on HRV purified bulks or HRV vaccine in final 
containers were also generated and are shown below.

From these PCV-1 titres as measured at the purified bulk level, the expected titre that should be 
detected at the final container stage would range from 8 to 26 CCID50 of PCV-1 per Rotavirus vaccine 
dose, taking into account a 30-fold dilution which is applied on average at vaccine formulation.  
The titre obtained on PK-15 cells for the pool of five HRV purifed bulks was 5.0 x 102 CCID50 per ml, 
which was in line with the titration results obtained on Vero cells (see below).

Consideration was given to spiking Rotarix final container samples with a well characterized PCV-1 viral 
stock to determine the putative interference effect that the rotavirus vaccine components may have on 
detection of PCV-1 particles by the different assays, but stocks of PCV-1 virus with high titre are 
difficult to obtain even from PK-15 cells. The MAH committed to investigate spiking experiments, and 
to continue to perform infectivity experiments with the titration assay. The availability of anti-PCV-1 
antibodies may be a limiting factor and will also be followed up.  
Human cell lines studies 
Previous studies demonstrated that although PCV gene expression and replication took place in human 
cells, the infection is non-productive (Hattermann et al, 2004). Therefore, in order to clarify the host 
range, the infectivity of the PCV-1 material detected in rotavirus vaccine was tested on MRC-5 (human 
diploid cell line), U937 (human monocytic cell line) and Hep2 cells (transformed human cell line) with 
testing being done mostly at day 0, day 3, day 6 and day 9 post-inoculation. Referring to the infection 
studies described by Hattermann et al., (2004), PCV-1 replication was observed in Hep2 cells. These 
cells were therefore used as positive control cell line in the infectivity assay on human cells. 
Expected results were obtained on Hep2 cell line, and mRNA transcripts were detected after the first 
and second passages for both PCV-1 positive control and Rotavirus purified bulk. From the third 
passage, mRNA transcripts were no longer detected. As already observed in previous assays on 
permissive cells, at day 0, a few mRNA transcripts are detected in the positive control, suggesting the 
presence of residual mRNA in the inoculum. No transcriptional activity is detected in the negative 
control or in Hep2 cells inoculated with the test samples. 
Similar results were observed for both MRC-5 and U-937 cell lines, i.e. no mRNA transcript detected in 
cell lysates up to the second or third cell passage.  
In addition, further inoculation of day 3 supernatant from all inoculated human cells also gave negative 
results using rep’ RT-Q-PCR readout, including positive Hep2 cells inoculated with the PCV-1 stock.  
These results showed that if PCV-1 is able to enter human permissive cells, further inoculation of PK-
15 permissive cells with the supernatant from PCV-infected cells fails to transmit the infection, clearly 
indicating that PCV-1 infection of human cells is non-productive (Hattermann et al., 2004).  
Electron microscopy studies 
Electron microscopy experiments were performed on Vero cells, Rotarix bulk and final vaccine but did 
not reveal the presence of PCV-1 virions. The difficulties and pre-requisites to conduct these analysis 
were noted, but the MAH committed to continue to investigate detection by electron microscopy and 
attempt to detect PCV-1 by this method in final container by combining immunoaggregation and on-
grid centrifugation.

2.2.  Measures to ensure Rotarix quality 
PCV-1 free vaccine  
A vaccine should not include any other component than necessary for obtaining the vaccination effect, 
thus the removal of PCV-1 from the vaccine is deemed necessary. The MAH has initiated steps to 
develop a PCV-1 free vaccine. Proposed actions included the impact of including clearance 
chromatographic step(s) and other means to remove PCV-1 particles or the development of a new cell 
bank and a new viral seed. This is however a very complex development, therefore scientific advice 
has been requested by the MAH and is presently ongoing.  
The MAH’s proposals and efforts to attempt to eliminate PCV-1 from Rotarix and to develop a PCV-free 
manufacturing process were endorsed by CHMP. The MAH will provide an implementation plan and 
continue to update the Committee on this matter on a regular basis.  
2.3.  Product Information 
The MAH initially proposed to update the SPC qualitative and quantitative composition information to 
reflect that PCV-1 had been detected, but this proposal was not considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
However, the quality development in light of these findings and the condition to develop a PCV-1 free 
vaccine was reflected in annex II.  
3.  Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
New information became available regarding the unexpected presence of DNA sequences of a non-
pathogenic viral strain of porcine circovirus 1 (PCV-1) in Rotarix. This DNA had been detected using a 
new non-specific analytical detection method (metagenomics analysis, with pyrosequencing) which was 
not part of the approved control method used. PCV-1 is a small (<20 nm), non-enveloped, single-
stranded DNA virus, that infects many different mammalian cells but does not cause any visible 
changes. PCV-1 is not known to be pathogenic for humans or animals. 
Subsequent analysis performed by the MAH revealed that PCV-1 has been present in the vaccine since 
early development, thus clinical batches (as used in clinical trials) as well as all commercial batches 
tested were positive to PCV-1 DNA. At the time of the marketing authorisation application, and despite 
fulfilment of all the relevant regulatory requirements in force at this time, PCV-1 DNA had not been 
detected. It is noted that as technology evolves, more relevant and sensitive methods are successively 
developed and introduced in order to detect viral sequences that had remained undetected before.  
Experiments were performed in several stages of Rotarix manufacturing process. It was noted that the 
total amount of PCV-1 DNA increased during the preparation of the Vero cell substrate. Further 
downstream (steps that do not involve dividing Vero cells), the PCV-1 DNA titre decreased in 
accordance with the dilution factor applied during the manufacturing. These data indicate that PCV-1 
DNA replicates in the initial phases of the Rotarix manufacturing process (where dividing Vero cells are 
involved), but no longer in the subsequent steps (downstream from single harvest). Results from 
infectivity studies indicate that the majority of the PCV-1 DNA in Rotarix does not represent intact PCV-
1 virions. These findings show that PCV-1 genome replication (and possibly also expression of viral 
PCV-1 proteins) occurs in the Vero cells but that few infective PCV-1 virions are produced during the 
Rotarix manufacturing process. The results in animal cell lines thus confirmed the presence of a very 
small amount of viral PCV-1 particles. Additional testing also showed that PCV-1 infection of human 
cells is non-productive.  
Seroconversion data and stool from vaccinated subjects were analysed. No seroconversion was 
observed in all subjects tested and the presence of PCV-1 in a few subjects’ stools was transient 
disappearing one week after vaccination. When considering immunocompromised infants, as immune 
suppression could favour the development of opportunistic infections, no signals suggestive of PCV-1 
infection or development of opportunistic infections were observed.  
Rotarix is indicated for the active immunisation of infants from the age of 6 weeks for prevention of 
gastro-enteritis due to rotavirus infection; the vaccine is effective in preventing rotavirus infections 
which are responsible for half a million deaths each year, mostly in developing countries. Its safety 
Assessment report for Rotarix

profile has been established based on placebo controlled clinical trials data, including monitoring of non 
serious and serious adverse events. More than 100 000 subjects have been included in clinical trials, of 
which over 50 000 subjects received Rotarix in over 20 trials. It is estimated that over 68 million 
infants have been exposed to this vaccine. There are no signals indicating that the presence of PCV-1 
has a negative effect on the efficacy or on the safety of the vaccine.  
Therefore, the PCV-1 presence does not raise any safety concerns; it is considered an early historical 
event at the time of establishment of the vaccine, not detected by analytical methods available at that 
time. This represents a general case for findings following implementation of more sensitive methods 
as science evolves, which, upon encountering such results, requires a risk-based approach as to what 
conclusions to draw, as it has been done with Rotarix. Although the PCV-1 findings do not pose a risk 
to public health, vaccines should not include any other component than necessary for obtaining the 
vaccination effect; the MAH is committed to eliminate PCV-1 from Rotarix and to develop a PCV-free 
vaccine. These efforts were endorsed by the Committee as reflected by the condition included in 
annex II.  
Benefit/risk balance 
Taken all the above into account, the benefit risk balance for Rotarix is considered favourable.  
4.  Overall conclusion 
Having considered the overall submitted data provided by the MAH in writing on the quality and in 
relation to the detection of PCV-1 in Rotarix the CHMP concluded that the benefit risk balance of 
Rotarix remains positive.  
The CHMP also concluded that information regarding the development of a PCV- free vaccine should be 
set out as a condition and recommended the amendment of annex II.  
Therefore the CHMP recommended the variation of the marketing authorisation for which the annex II 
is set out in the annexes of the opinion. 
Follow-up measures undertaken by the marketing authorisation holder 
The MAH must ensure that the registration dossier is updated to reflect the technical and scientific 
progress and information which might influence the benefit/risk of the medicinal product. 
In relation to this obligation and as requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to submit the follow-up 
measures as listed below :

5.  Conclusion and grounds for the recommendation 
The Committee considered the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Rotarix 
initiated by the European Commission. 
The Committee considered all available data submitted by the MAH on the quality and in relation to the 
detection of PCV-1 in Rotarix.  
The Committee concluded that the benefit still outweighs the risks in the currently authorised 
therapeutic indication for Rotarix.  
The Committee concluded that a PCV-1 free vaccine should be developed.  
The Committee concluded that the marketing authorisation for Rotarix should contain information 
regarding the development of a PCV-1 free vaccine and therefore recommended the amendment of 
annex II.

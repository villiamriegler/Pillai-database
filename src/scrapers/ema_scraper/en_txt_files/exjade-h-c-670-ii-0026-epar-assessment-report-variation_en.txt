2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Exjade is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions 
( ≥ 7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years 
and older. 
Exjade is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
- 
- 
in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions 
(≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood 
transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older, 
- 
in patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
Chronic iron overload may result from repeated transfusions (transfusional hemosiderosis) or from an 
increased intestinal absorption of iron, which is the primary source of iron overload in such conditions 
as hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT). Chronic iron 
overload, if left untreated, often results in serious complications such as liver abnormalities as well as 
cardiac, metabolic and endocrine disturbances. The goals of iron chelation therapy are to remove the 
amount of iron administered in blood transfusions or through intestinal overabsorption and, as 
required, to reduce the existing iron burden. 
Thalassaemic disorders are a heterogeneous group of congenital blood disorders characterized by a 
partly or completely suppressed production of normal haemoglobin due to impaired synthesis of 
haemoglobin subunits, namely α-globin and β-globin.  
The clinical picture of thalassemia may be mild (thalassemia minor), moderate (NTDT) or severe 
(thalassemia major). Patients with thalassemia minor are asymptomatic, while patients with 
thalassemia major present with severe anaemia early in life requiring regular blood transfusions and 
chelation therapy to prevent or reverse transfusional iron overload. Patients with non-transfusion 
dependent thalassemia (e.g., β-thalassemia intermedia, HbE β-thalassemia, and HbH α-thalassemia) 
have milder anaemia compared to thalassemia major and therefore they require no or only occasional 
blood transfusions. Despite that, NTDT patients develop clinically relevant iron overload, mainly due to 
an increased intestinal absorption of iron driven by anaemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis. 
The mechanism of iron loading in NTDT is considered similar to that described for HH in that it is a 
direct result of down-regulation of hepcidin, leading to increased gastro-intestinal absorption of iron. In 
HH the low hepcidin levels are related to a mutation in the HFE gene while in NTDT, the low hepcidin 
levels are a compensatory response to the anaemia. 
In this application, the MAH proposed a new indication of Exjade for the treatment of chronic iron 
overload requiring chelation therapy in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia 
syndromes aged 10 years and older.  
This proposed new indication for deferasirox is based on a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II 
Study CICL760A2209 and Study A2202/E Study CICL670A2202/E, a phase I/II open-label, dose 
escalation study in HH patients, provides additional safety data.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
In this application, the MAH assumed that the prevalence of non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia 
patients with clinically significant iron overload is assumed to be in the same range as the prevalence 
of transfusion-dependent thalassemia intermedia (which represents 2 - 14% of the total number of 
transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients). As a consequence, it was not expected to lead to any 
significant increase in the environmental exposure to deferasirox drug substance for the following 
reasons: 
(1) in Europe, iron-overloaded patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) 
syndromes constitute a small minority of patients with chronic iron overload requiring chelation 
therapy; 
(2) unlike in transfusional iron overload, where life-long, continuous chelation therapy is required, 
treatment of NTDT patients will be intermittent and is estimated to be needed during less than 10% of 
a patient’s lifetime. The number of patients on treatment at any one time is expected to reflect this 
ratio; 
(3) because of the absence of ongoing transfusional iron intake, a lower maximum dose will be 
recommended in these patients (20 mg/kg/day, as opposed to 40 mg/kg/day in transfusional 
haemosiderosis). 
Furthermore, the ERA submitted at the time on initial marketing authorisation was based on a 
conservative approach for the calculation of the potential environmental exposure. 
Therefore, this new indication is not expected to adversely affect the initial environmental risk 
assessment.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study CICL670A2202 was a Phase I/II open-label, dose-escalation trial to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of deferasirox in patients with iron overload resulting from hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). 
Pharmacokinetic blood sampling were performed only at the week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and last visit (week 
24) in the core phase. The pharmacokinetic blood sampling was performed just prior to administration 
of the next deferasirox dose or approximately 24 hours after the previous dose (pre-dose trough 
value). This visit was scheduled in the morning, in order to allow patients to withhold deferasirox. 
All subjects with evaluable PK parameters were to be included in the data analysis. The relationship 
between drug concentration and the pharmacodynamic variable were to be examined by fitting PK 
model, (type of model, software, statistical tests). 
Summary statistics of deferasirox trough concentrations is provided in Table 1.

Table 1 – Descriptive statistics for deferasirox trough concentrations [umol/L], by dose 
cohort (Per-protocol population) 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Steady-state pharmacokinetics of deferasirox was achieved by week 4 for 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg. Mean 
trough concentrations at week 4 were approximately dose proportional. 
This is only true for week 4. Indeed, concentrations corresponding to 10 and 15 mg/kg/day from Week 
8 appear similar (the expected ration was not observed). That may explain that the overall efficacy in 
the 15 mg/kg/day group was not statistically better than in the 10 mg/kg/day group.  
Difference in deferasirox plasma exposure between HH or NTDT versus patients with transfusion-
dependent iron overload (i.e., higher exposure in patients with HH or NTDT) and difference in 
Deferasirox plasma exposure between healthy subjects versus patients with transfusion-dependent 
iron overload (i.e., higher exposure in healthy subjects) are consistent: greater exposure due to the 
fact “that chelatable iron levels are much lower in healthy patients” or both HH or NTDT patients than 
in patients with transfusion-dependent iron overload. 
Therefore, the lower recommended initial daily dose of Exjade in non-transfusion-dependent patients in 
comparison with transfusion-dependent patients is justified (10 and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively).

2.4.  Clinical efficacy  
2.4.1.  Main study CICL670A2209 (THALASSA)  
Methods 
Study No CICL670A2209 (THALASSA) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II 
study to evaluate efficacy and safety of deferasirox in non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients 
with iron overload. 
Study Participants  
The main criteria for inclusion were: male or female patients ≥10 years of age (≥18 years in Greece 
only) with NTDT syndromes, who had not received any transfusion within the 6 months prior to entry 
into the study with LIC ≥ 5 mg Fe/g dw measured by R2 MRI and serum ferritin >300 ng/mL at 
screening (two consecutive values at least 14 days apart from each other). 
Treatments 
Two different deferasirox starting doses (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) were evaluated. The placebo control 
comprised matching dose. Patients received treatment for 52 weeks. Doubling of the randomization 
dose (up to 20 mg/kg/day) was considered after 24 weeks of treatment in patients without ≥15% 
decrease in LIC and with LIC ≥ 7 mg Fe/g dw. At end of study patients could enter a one-year 
extension study. 
Any additional therapy aimed to treat non-transfusion dependent thalassemia during this trial (e.g. 
therapy with hydroxyurea, erythropoietin, butyrate) is not allowed. Except for the study medication, no 
other iron chelation therapy was administered while patients were enrolled in this trial. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To compare the efficacy of two regimens of deferasirox administration (starting doses of 5 and 
10 mg/kg/day) in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) based on change in 
liver iron content (LIC) from baseline after one year of treatment compared to placebo treated 
patients. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To compare the efficacy of two regimens of deferasirox administration (starting doses of 5 and 
10 mg/kg/day) based on change in LIC from baseline after 6 months of treatment with the 
placebo-treated patients 
To compare change in serum ferritin over one year of treatment between deferasirox and 
placebo 
To evaluate the safety of both regimens of deferasirox versus placebo in NTDT patients 
To evaluate efficacy and safety of dose doubling 
To evaluate the last LIC value under doubled dose to the last value of LIC before the doubling 
of the dose 
To evaluate the relationship between serum ferritin and LIC

• 
• 
To assess the change from baseline in haematological and iron metabolism parameters (e.g. 
haemoglobin, transferrin saturation) 
To evaluate the iron accumulation rate based on LIC assessment in NTDT patients treated with 
placebo. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: The primary efficacy parameter was the change in LIC from baseline after 12 months of 
treatment with study drug. Change in LIC at 6 months was a secondary efficacy endpoint. Other 
secondary objectives were serum ferritin assessment, change from baseline in haematological and iron 
metabolism parameters and iron accumulation rate evaluation. 
LIC was measured using a validated R2 MRI technique both at screening (Visit 1 or Visit 2), Month 6 
(Visit 12), and EOS. All patients enrolled in the study had MRI scans using a specific sequence and raw 
image data was analysed centrally to determine the patient’s LIC value. 
Serum ferritin levels were measured at screening (Visit 1 and Visit 2) and then at Visit 7 and at every 
subsequent study visit (except Visits 121, 122 and 123) by a central laboratory. 
Haematological and iron metabolism parameters: total serum iron, serum transferrin, transferring 
saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, non-transferrin-bound iron [NTBI], labile plasma iron [LPI], 
serum erythropoietin, reticulocyte count, nucleated red blood cell count [NRBC], haemoglobin, plasma 
haemoglobin, plasma haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], plasma hepcidin and growth 
differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). 
Safety: Safety was assessed by monitoring the frequency, duration and severity of adverse events 
(AEs), clinical evaluations (physical examinations, vital signs, body weight, auditory and ocular tests, 
echocardiography, ECG) throughout the study, as well as clinical laboratory analyses. 
Sample size 
The sample-size was determined to obtain 90% power for showing superiority of at least 1 deferasirox 
treatment group over placebo with respect to change from baseline in LIC at Week 52. A sample-size 
of 46 patients in each deferasirox group and 23 in each matching placebo group (138 patients in total) 
is sufficient to achieve 90% power to reject at least 1 of the 2 null hypotheses comparing deferasirox 
to placebo with the multiplicity adjustment described in study protocol. 
Considering a potential of 10% patients without any post-baseline LIC value, the sample-size needed 
to be increased to 52 patients for each deferasirox group and to 26 for each placebo group (156 
patients in total). 
Randomisation 
The randomization ratio was 2:1:2:1 (5 mg/kg/day deferasirox / matching placebo dose / 10 
mg/kg/day deferasirox / matching placebo dose). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study (treatment was blinded, dose was not blinded), and patients, 
investigator staff, persons performing the assessments and data analysts remained blind to the 
identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock.

Statistical methods 
Primary efficacy analysis (Absolute change of LIC at Week 52) 
The primary efficacy variable was the absolute change in LIC from baseline to Week 52, i.e. the 
difference of LIC at Week 52 minus LIC at baseline. If no LIC measurement was available at Week 52, 
the last available post-baseline LIC measurement before Week 52 was used. The study was to be 
claimed successful if the superiority of at least 1 deferasirox treatment group (starting dose of 5 or 10 
mg/kg/day) relative to placebo could be demonstrated with regard to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Multiplicity was addressed by statistical test procedures controlling a 1-sided family-wise type I error 
rate to 0.025 and 2-sided simultaneous 95% confidence intervals. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
was performed with 1-sided t-tests using Dunnett’s adjustment for multiple comparisons to the placebo 
control group. In case both deferasirox groups were statistically superior to placebo (and only in this 
case), the 2 deferasirox groups were compared by means of a 2- sided t-test at a significance level of 
5%. 
Secondary efficacy analysis 
Absolute Change from baseline LIC at Week 24 was analysed in the same way as the primary efficacy 
variable on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). 
For serum ferritin quarterly change from baseline, a mixed effect model was fitted on the with-fixed 
factors treatment, quarter, and treatment-by-quarter interaction. An unstructured correlation matrix 
was assumed for measurements taken within the same patient. In the rare situation that a post-
baseline average for a quarter was missing the last available quarter prior was carried forward. For the 
fourth quarter, each deferasirox group was compared to placebo by 1-sided t-tests using Dunnett’s 
adjustment for multiple comparisons to the placebo control group (family-wise type I error rate 0.025). 
the 2 deferasirox groups were compared by means of a 2-sided t-test at a significance level of 5%. 
The correlation of LIC versus serum ferritin at baseline was assessed as well as the correlation of 
relative change in LIC versus relative change in serum ferritin at week 24 and week 52. The effect of 
dose increase was evaluated by summarizing the last LIC value after the Week 24 LIC assessment and 
the last value before or at the Week 24 LIC assessment with descriptive statistics by treatment group 
and separately for patients with and without increase. Patient subgroup analyses were also performed. 
Analyses of exploratory haematological and iron metabolism parameters observed values (and changes 
from baseline) averaged at baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12 and last available month 
were summarized by descriptive statistics and in figures showing means and 95% confidence intervals. 
Total serum iron, observed value (and changes from baseline) averaged at baseline, monthly average 
and last available month were summarized similarly as were serum erythropoietin, plasma hepcidin 
and growth differentiation factor (GDF 15).

Supportive study ICL670A2202 
Study ICL670A2202 was an open label, multi-centre, dose-escalation study of ICL670 consisting of 
4 planned dose levels: dose level 1 (5 mg/kg/day), dose level 2 (10 mg/kg/day), dose level 3 
(15 mg/kg/day) and dose level 4 (20 mg/kg/day). All patients received treatment for 24 weeks in core 
study and an additional 6 month in the extension phase. Enrolment into dose level 2, 3 and 4 was 
based on the data generated and safety review by MAH and DMC from the previous dose level.  
The primary objective of this trial was to explore the safety of deferasirox (dose range 5 to 20 
mg/kg/day) in adult hemochromatosis patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation, with iron 
overload. The secondary objectives were to explore the effect of ICL670 on serum ferritin and to 
characterize the pharmacokinetics of deferasirox in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. 
At least 40 patients were planned to be treated. Forty nine patients were recruited into the study, out 
of which 37 patients completed the core study (10, 11 and 16 patients in the 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day 
doses, respectively). Out of the 37 patients completing the core study, 26 chose to continue with the 
Assessment report

extension and 23 completed the extension study (9, 6 and 8 patients in the 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day 
doses, respectively). 
The main efficacy variable was the effect of deferasirox on serum ferritin, especially the change in 
serum ferritin from baseline at 24 weeks and 48 weeks. The secondary efficacy variables consisted of 
further characterizing the effect of deferasirox on serum ferritin (longitudinal course and time to 
normalization) and pharmacokinetics of deferasirox. 
The primary objective of this study was safety, with incidence and severity of adverse events being the 
primary endpoints. 
As indicated in section 2.3.2, characterisation of the pharmacokinetics was conducted in order to 
obtain the trough values of deferasirox which were summarized descriptively and plasma 
concentrations were to be plotted over time by dose group. 
Patient baseline demographics were comparable between treatment groups. The patient population 
was Caucasian consisting of mainly male patients, with a mean age of 50.6 years and mean BMI of 
27.16 kg/m2. The mean time since initial diagnosis of hemochromatosis was 3.1 years with a mean 
serum ferritin value of 1149.7 μg/L. In the core study, out of 49 patients, 37 (75.5%) completed the 
core study and the main cause for discontinuations were due to AEs (7/49, 14.3%).Out of the 
26 patients who continued with the extension, 23 (88.5%) completed the extension study wherein 
there were 3 discontinuations - 2 due to AEs and 1 due to administrative problems. 
Results of the main efficacy endpoint are presented in the table below.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  MAH  submitted  this  type  II  variation  to  extend  Exjade  to  the  treatment  of  chronic  iron  overload 
requiring  chelation  therapy  in  patients  with  non-transfusion-dependent  thalassaemia  syndromes  aged 
10 years and older.  
Data are mainly taken from one pivotal and one supportive study. 
The pivotal Study A2209 was a phase II randomised double blind placebo controlled study designed to 
assess  the  efficacy  and  the  safety  of  deferasirox  in  NTDT  patients  (aged  >10  years-old)  with  iron 
overload. One hundred and sixty-six (166) patients were included and followed during 52 weeks. The 
supportive study A2202 was designed to determine both safety and efficacy of deferasirox in a limited 
number of adult patients (49) with iron overload from hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Results taken 
from  this  last  study  should  however  be  taken  with  caution  since  the  patient's  population  is  not 
comparable to that studied in the pivotal study. 
As  the  objective  was  to  reverse  iron  overload,  only  patients  with  LIC  ≥  7  mg  Fe/g  dw  and  serum 
ferritin > 500 ng/mL should have been included and an active comparator should have been used as 
recommended  by  treatment  guidelines  issued  by  the  Thalassaemia  International  Federation  (2007). 
The primary endpoint should have been a success rate (responders analysis).  
The  non-inferiority  of  Exjade  against  deferoxamine  has  not  been  formally  demonstrated  as  no  direct 
comparison is available due to the design of the study. Advantages of an orally available chelator are 
acknowledged,  but,  iron  burden  reversal/prevention  in  this  indication  is  probably  obtained  with 
relatively short treatments. Advantage of the oral route is in this context less convincing. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results  of  Study  2209  showed  a  decrease  in  iron  overload  in  patients  with  NTDT.  The  effect  seems 
dose-dependent.  
However,  based  on  the  above  considerations,  without  data  on  relative  efficacy  and  safety  profiles  of 
deferasirox  and  deferoxamine,  possible  inferiority  cannot  be  excluded.  Therefore,  similarly  to  the 
currently approved indication of Exjade in second-line treatment of TDT patients, the use of Exjade in 
NTDT  patients  should  be  restricted  to  the  treatment  of  chronic  iron  overload  requiring  chelation 
therapy when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
Finally,  the  indication  on  when  it  is  convenient  to  start  chelation  therapy  was  based  on  predicted 
results  and  it  was  not  soundly  supported.  The  trend  in  serum  ferritin  by  monthly  evaluation  may  be 
helpful  in  monitoring  the  efficacy  of  the  therapy,  but  it  cannot  substitute  the  direct  measurement  of 
iron overload in the target organs. Thus, the cut-off of ferritine levels >800 µg/L is not the preferred 
criterion to initiate chelation in NTDT patients and a direct evaluation of liver i.e. LIC and, eventually 
heart overload, assessment by MRI is a better element to decide when to start iron chelation treatment 
and to monitor iron overload risk. 
As the MAH no longer claimed any prevention of overload in NTDT, and considering that maintenance 
after  successful  treatment  is  secondary  prevention,  Exjade  should  be  approved  only  to  correct  iron 
overload in NTDT with treatment being interrupted as soon as correction is obtained.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study  A2209  results  showed  a  decrease  in  iron  overload  in  patients  with  NTDT. However,  due  to  the 
lack of comparison with deferoxamine the use of Exjade in NTDT should be limited when deferoxamine 
therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile in this dossier is primarily based on data from Study A2209 as well as the supportive 
safety data from the core and core plus extension populations of Study A2202/E. 
Patient exposure 
In study A2209, a total of 166 patients were randomized: (i) 110 patients were treated with 
deferasirox 5 or 10 mg/kg/day, and (ii) 56 were treated with placebo 5 or 10 mg/kg/day. 
The mean duration of exposure ranged from 11.4 months in the 5 mg/kg/day deferasirox group to 
11.8 months in the 10 mg/kg/day placebo group. The majority of patients had at least 9 months of 
exposure (89.1% of patients in each deferasirox group, and 94.6% of patients in the combined placebo 
group).  
A majority of patients (89.2%) completed the study. The rate of discontinuation was slightly higher in 
the deferasirox groups (12.7% and 10.9% of patients in the 5 and 10 mg/kg/day groups, respectively) 
compared to 8.9% of patients in the combined placebo group. The major reasons for discontinuation 
were AEs, abnormal laboratory values and withdrawal of consent, combined as 3 (5.5%), 5 (9.1%), 
and 4 (7.1%) patients in the deferasirox 5 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day and combined placebo groups, 
respectively. Patients lost to follow-up were 3 (5.5%) and 1 (1.8%) in deferasirox 5 mg/kg and 
10 mg/kg, treatment groups, respectively. 
The proportion of patients with a dose increase based on the Week 24 LIC assessment was slightly 
lower in the deferasirox 10 mg/kg/day group (45.5%) and in the deferasirox 5 mg/kg/day group 
(47.3%) than in the combined placebo group (53.6%). According to the MAH, this could be explained 
by the fact that more patients in the active treatment groups were responding, and hence, a lesser 
percentage needed a dose increase compared to placebo. As a consequence of the dose increase, the 
average actual daily dose tended to be above the randomized dose in all treatment groups: mean 
(±SD) was 5.6 (±1.4), 11.5 (±2.93), 5.9 (±1.4) and 11.8 (±2.88) mg/kg/day for the deferasirox 
5 mg/kg/day group, deferasirox 10 mg/kg/day group, placebo 5 mg/kg/day group, and placebo 
10 mg/kg/day group, respectively.  
The safety population of Study A2202/E included all patients (N=49) who received at least one dose 
of study drug within the core study and had at least one safety assessment within the core study.  
The extension safety population included all patients (N=26) who received at least one dose of study 
drug within the extension study and had at least one safety assessment within the extension study. 
Safety was evaluated for the core period using the safety population, and for the core plus extension 
period using the extension safety population.  
Two-thirds of the patients in the A2202/E Safety Population were male, and all patients were 
Caucasian (consistent with the genetic patterns of C282Y homozygous hemochromatosis). Patients 
were older than in Study A2209: the median age was 53 years with no patients <18 years of age 
(range 19 to 87). 
Assessment report  
EMA/44672/2013  
Page 22/44 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean duration of exposure in the core was 18.3 weeks: 22.2 weeks in the 5 mg/kg/day group, 
19.0 weeks in the 10 mg/kg/day group and 15.9 weeks in the 15 mg/kg/day group. The mean 
duration of exposure in the core plus extension for the extension safety population was 40.4 weeks: 
43.4 weeks in the 5 mg/kg/day group, 48.4 weeks in the 10 mg/kg/day group and 33.6 weeks in the 
15 mg/kg/day group. 
Adverse events  
Study A2209 
The system organ classes (SOC) with the highest incidence of AEs overall (at least 20% in any 
treatment group) were infections and infestations, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and 
administration site conditions, nervous system disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders, and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.  
The incidence of AEs in the SOC infections and infestations and nervous system disorders were similar 
between each deferasirox arm and its matching placebo arm. For the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders, 
the overall incidences were higher with placebo than with deferasirox and the incidences were higher 
with the higher doses. 
The number of patients with AEs per preferred term was small. Overall, the most frequent AEs (at least 
10% in any deferasirox or the combined placebo group) were headache, upper respiratory tract 
infection, oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia, rash, diarrhoea, and nausea. 
Headache, rash, fatigue, rhinitis, and dyspepsia were more frequent (at least 5% difference) in the 
10 mg/kg/day deferasirox group than in the 5 mg/kg/day deferasirox group. Upper abdominal pain 
and dyspepsia occurred in at least one deferasirox group and not on placebo. Upper respiratory tract 
infection and pyrexia were more frequently reported in either placebo group compared to either 
deferasirox group. 
Study A2202/E 
In the Core phase, the majority of patients in all dose levels reported at least one AE (95.9% overall). 
The SOC with the highest incidence of AEs (at least 20% of all patients) was gastrointestinal disorders, 
followed by infections and infestations, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, investigations, 
nervous system disorders and general disorders and administration site conditions. 
Twenty-five of the 26 patients (96.2%) in the Extension safety population reported at least one AE 
during core plus extension. The frequencies were comparable to those reported in the core for the 
Safety population. The highest incidence of AEs (at least 20% of all patients) was reported for the 
SOCs gastrointestinal disorders (65.4%), followed by musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
(50%), infections and infestations (42.3%), investigations (38.5%), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (34.6%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (30.8%) and nervous 
system disorders (26.9%) and eye disorders (23.1%). 
By preferred term, the most frequent AEs overall (at least 10%) in the core phase were diarrhoea, 
headache, nausea, abdominal pain, back pain, increased blood creatinine, increased ALT, rash, 
flatulence and nasopharyngitis. In general, the frequencies of AEs were lower in the 5 mg/kg/day 
group than in the 10 mg/kg/day or 15 mg/kg/day groups. Some preferred terms (e.g., headache, 
nausea and rash) were reported more frequently in the 15 mg/kg/day group than in the 10 mg/kg/day 
(or 5 mg/kg/day) group, whereas the incidence of other preferred terms (e.g., diarrhoea, abdominal 
pain) were similar between the 15 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day groups (but lower in the 5 
mg/kg/day group). 
Assessment report  
EMA/44672/2013  
Page 23/44 
 
 
 
 
By preferred term, the most frequent AEs in the core plus extension (at least 15%) were diarrhoea, 
back pain, increased blood creatinine, headache, arthralgia, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, 
fatigue and rash.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study A2209 
There were no deaths in Study A2209. 
Twenty-four patients reported serious adverse events (SAEs). The overall incidences of SAEs in Study 
A2209 were comparable between deferasirox and placebo, with slightly higher incidences being 
reported in the 10 mg/kg/day dose groups than in the 5 mg/kg/day dose groups both for deferasirox 
and placebo.  
SAEs considered related to study drug by the investigator were reported for 4 patients: 3 in the 
deferasirox 5 mg/kg/day group (abdominal pain, cellulitis and hepatotoxicity), and one in the 
deferasirox 10 mg/kg/day group (pruritus and rash). The patients experiencing the abdominal pain and 
cellulitis SAEs resolved and the patients continued on the study. The hepatotoxicity event occurred at 
the end of the core treatment and was ongoing as of the last report. The patient who experienced 
pruritus/rash SAEs discontinued study treatment. 
AEs of special interest were analysed for Study A2209 based on signals observed during previously 
conducted clinical MAH has described the 9 groups of terms that comprise the adverse events of 
special interest in this dossier. By grouped term, each group had no more than 2 patients with one AE 
each. 
In addition, regarding skin rash, few patients met the event criteria for severe or persistent skin rash: 
1 patient in the 5 mg/kg/day deferasirox group, 3 patients in the 10 mg/kg/day deferasirox group, and 
1 patient in the placebo 5 mg/kg/day group. One of the patients in the 10 mg/kg/day deferasirox 
group had 2 episodes of severe or persistent rash, the others had a single episode each. Study drug 
was interrupted within 10 days of event onset for 2 of the patients in the 10 mg/kg/day deferasirox 
group. Two patients, both in the 10 mg/kg/day deferasirox group, had rash events that were ongoing 
at end of study. One patient had SAEs of severe rash and pyrexia for which he was hospitalized. The 
events were suspected to be related to study drug. Study drug was later discontinued due to rash and 
pruritus. The other patient had mild macular rash that was not suspected to be related to study drug 
that had started on Day 57 and was ongoing at end of study. 
Study A2202/E 
No deaths occurred either in the core study or in the extension study.  
One SAE (prostate cancer recurrent) was reported in the extension study, while none were reported in 
the core study. The patient had a history of prostate cancer and prostectomy. He was diagnosed with 
recurrence of prostate cancer on day 28 of the core phase. The patient received medical treatment and 
radiotherapy and recovered on day 119. 
In the core, moderate skin rash was reported for 2 patients, and severe skin rash was reported for 
1 patient (all 3 were in the 15 mg/kg/day group). No additional events were reported in the extension. 
Median time to event could not be estimated due to low number of events. The durations of the 
2 events of moderate skin rash were 11 and 21 days, respectively, and of the severe skin rash was 
5 days.

Laboratory findings 
For Study A2209, notably abnormal values in key safety laboratory parameters post-baseline are 
summarised in the table below.  
Table 6 – Post-baseline laboratory results meeting criteria for notable values  
(Study A2209 – Safety set) 
Haematology  
In Study A2209, there were no patients with AEs related to decreases in platelet or neutrophil counts. 
No relevant differences were observed over time across the treatment groups for any of the 
haematology parameters assessed. Subgroup analyses of haematology parameters did not reveal any 
relevant differences for age, gender, or race. 
In the core study A2202/E, there were no shifts to notable values for platelets (<100 x 109/L) or 
neutrophils (<1.5 x 109/L) in the core study and no clinically relevant changes from baseline. Shifts 
from low/normal at baseline to high were infrequent for most haematology parameters and not 
considered clinically relevant by the MAH.  
In the core+extension, there were no patients with a shift to a notable value for platelets (platelet 
<100 x 109/L). One patient with a low neutrophil count at baseline had at least 2 consecutive 
neutrophil values <1.5 x 109/L during the core plus extension, and 4 patients with normal neutrophil 
counts at baseline had a neutrophil value (but not consecutive measurements) that was <1.5 x 109/L 
during the core plus extension.  
Clinical Chemistry  
With the exception of changes in parameters of renal and hepatic function (discussed below), no 
relevant differences in clinical chemistry parameters were observed over time across the treatment 
groups in Study A2209. 
No relevant changes were noted for the other clinical chemistry parameters in study A2202/E. A slight 
increase in creatinine that was more pronounced with the higher doses was noted by Week 4; 
creatinine levels remained stable thereafter across all dose groups. No further change in creatinine 
levels was apparent with longer follow-up in the extension study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/44672/2013  
Page 25/44 
 
 
 
 
 
In the core study, shifts from low/normal at baseline to high were most frequently observed for the 
following parameters: creatinine (54.2%), ALT (41.7%), AST (34.1%), and bilirubin (15.2%). The 
shifts tended to be less frequent in the 5 mg/kg/day dose group than in the 10 mg/kg/day or 
15 mg/kg/day dose groups. Similar results were observed in the extension. 
Renal function  
Study A2209 
Analysis of AEs of special interest revealed only a few patients with AEs related to renal function. None 
were severe, and only one event (moderate proteinuria) led to discontinuation of study drug.  
Proteinuria was reported for 2 patients: One mild proteinuria after 2 months on deferasirox treatment 
(5 mg/kg/day) which resolved after a week without intervention. This patient had slightly elevated 
UPCR at baseline; One moderate proteinuria following dose escalation of deferasirox to 10 mg/kg/day 
which led to discontinuation of study drug (event ongoing). 
As indicated in the above table, notable abnormalities in creatinine, creatinine clearance and/or UPCR 
were reported for 5 patients (all on deferasirox treatment).  
Resolution was evident for all the above cases except one patient for whom the decrease in creatinine 
clearance occurred towards the end of the study and there were no further study visits. None of these 
events led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Evaluation of shifts for additional categories of creatinine, creatinine clearance and UPCR showed that 
these shifts were infrequent overall, and occurred across treatment groups. The frequencies of shifts 
were similar in the placebo groups and the 5 mg/kg/day deferasirox group, and slightly higher in the 
10 mg/kg/day deferasirox group.  
Categorical analyses of relative changes in creatinine clearance from baseline to last value were 
conducted. Most patients had an increase or a decrease in creatinine clearance falling into either the 
0 to 10% or 10 to 20% categories. The distribution of categorical changes in CrCl was similar in the 
deferasirox and the placebo groups. Decreases of >20% were infrequent: 2 patients (3.6%) and 
9 patients (16.4%) in the deferasirox 5 and 10 mg/kg/day groups, and 4 patients (7.1%) in the 
combined placebo group). 
Serum creatinine levels and creatinine clearance remained relatively constant over time across 
deferasirox and placebo groups. UPCR values fluctuated over time in all treatment groups without 
showing any clear trends. Evaluating creatinine clearance by average actual daily dose showed similar 
results for placebo and the lowest deferasirox dose category, and a slightly higher decrease in 
creatinine clearance with higher deferasirox doses, although it remained within the boundaries of the 
mean intra-subject variability of 18.7% in creatinine clearance assessment (Toffaletti et al 2008). At 
Month 12, the relative change from baseline in creatinine clearance was as follows: -3.1±12.8% for 
placebo, -2.1±13.5% for deferasirox >0 to <7.5 mg/kg/day, -5.8±13.9% for deferasirox ≥ 7.5 to 
≤ 12.5 mg/kg/day, and -9.1±13.1% for deferasirox >12.5 to ≤ 17.5 mg/kg/day. 
Study A2202/E 
A total of 14 patients had AEs related to renal function (renal impairment, blood creatinine increased, 
and/or creatinine renal clearance decreased) during core and/or extension treatment.  
By dose group, these AEs were reported for 1 patient (9.1%), 6 patients (40.0%) and 7 patients 
(30.4%) in the 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day groups, respectively.  
Four patients experienced renal impairment (2 patients in the 10 mg/kg/day group and 2 patients in 
the 15 mg/kg/day group; one of the latter had also creatinine increased). One of these 4 patients

(10  mg/kg/day group) discontinued the study due to renal impairment). In addition, 2 patients had 
dose adjustments and no action was needed for the fourth patient. None of these events were severe 
and all resolved. 
Eleven patients experienced blood creatinine increased (including the patient who also had renal 
impairment mentioned above). One patient (10 mg/kg/day group) also had decreased creatinine 
clearance (this patient had 3 episodes of increased creatinine) Most events were mild in intensity. 
Study drug was temporarily interrupted for 9 of the 11 patients due to increased creatinine. The events 
of increased creatinine resolved for 10 of the 11 patients. 
In the core part, creatinine levels increased slightly with treatment in all dose groups and remained 
stable thereafter. Eleven of 48 patients (22.4%) with normal creatinine at baseline had 2 consecutive 
values during the study that were >33% increased from baseline and >ULN (5 patients were in the 
10 mg/kg/day group and 6 patients were in the 15 mg/kg/day group).  
A total of 77.6% of patients had a decrease in creatinine clearance (centering mainly on the 0 to 10% 
category, but also in the 10 to 20% and 20 to 30% categories), and 22.4% had an increase. The shift 
in patients in the 5 mg/kg/day group tended to be smaller (mostly <10% in either direction) than in 
the 10 or 15 mg/kg/day dose groups. Decreases of >20% were seen for 2 patients (18.2%), 4 patients 
(26.7%), and 6 patients (26.1%) in the 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively 
Creatinine levels remained relatively stable; there were 7 patients (26.9%) in the extension safety 
population with creatinine >33% increased from baseline and > ULN on 2 consecutive visits at least 
7 days apart.  
A total of 92.3% of patients had a decrease in creatinine clearance (mostly in the 0 to 10%, 10 to 
20%, 20 to 30% categories). Decreases of >20% were seen for 2 patients (22.2%), 2 patients 
(33.3%), and 4 patients (36.4%) in the 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively. 
Hepatic function  
Study A2209 
ALT and AST decreased slightly over time in patients on deferasirox, which was more evident in the 
higher dose group. Shifts from below ULN at baseline to above ULN occurred in about a third of the 
patients with normal baseline values, and there were no relevant differences between deferasirox- and 
placebo-treated patients (respectively 30 and 35%). There is no cases of ALT >5N in deferasirox 
groups.  
Two patients (one in the 10 mg/kg/day deferasirox group and one on placebo) had shifts to AST and / 
or ALT >5 x ULN and >2x baseline.  
One patent in the 10 mg/kg/day deferasirox group had an AST value of 457 U/L that met the criteria of 
notable abnormality. He also had ALT of 185 U/L, which did not meet the above criteria of notable, and 
was reported as an AE (SOC: Investigations) with suspected relationship to study drug.  
One patient in the 10 mg/kg/day placebo group had a single occurrence of concurrent notable AST 
(228 U/L) and ALT (271 U/L) values. Neither ALT nor AST were reported as an AE for this patient. 
Analysis of AEs of special interest revealed 3 patients with AEs related to hepatic function (one with 
hepatotoxicity, and 2 with increased ALT or AST). No patient in Study A2209 discontinued due to 
increases in transaminases.  
Study A2202/E 
Assessment report  
EMA/44672/2013  
Page 27/44 
 
 
 
 
 
One patient from the 15 mg/kg/day group had an ALT value >5 times the ULN. No such value occurred 
in the 5 and 10 mg/kg/day groups. No AST value >5 times the ULN occurred for any of the extension 
safety population patients. The majority of increases in AST and ALT occurred in the 15 mg/kg/day 
dose cohort, and in all cases where available, follow-up lab values returned to within baseline range 
within a period of 2-4 weeks, usually in conjunction with a dose interruption. 
In Study A2202/E, increased ALT, AST and/or transaminase were reported as AE(s) for 9 patients 
(8 patients during the core and one additional patient during the extension). Most of the events were 
mild or moderate in intensity and considered related to study drug.  
By dose group, these AEs were reported for 3 patients (20.0%) and 5 patients (21.7%) in the 10 and 
15 mg/kg/day groups, respectively during core treatment and 1 additional patient in the 5 mg/kg/day 
group during the extension. Four patients discontinued, 4 patients had temporary interruption of study 
drug, and no change in study drug was required for 1 patient. The events resolved for all except one of 
the patient who discontinued. Two of the patients with increased ALT had also increased AST reported 
as AE (one of them discontinued). Elevated serum transaminase led to discontinuation during 
extension treatment for one patient with concurrent renal impairment. In addition, one patient in the 
10 mg/kg/day group had hepatic function abnormal reported as an AE. The event was mild, not 
suspected to be related to study drug, and resolved in 3 weeks without intervention. 
One of the above-mentioned patients had dose escalation of study drug (from 5 mg/kg/day to 
10 mg/kg/day) about a month prior to the event during extension treatment; none of the other 
patients had dose escalation during the core or extension of the study. 
ECGs, vital signs, body weight and physical examinations  
In Study A2209, evaluation of vital signs and weight revealed no relevant differences between the 
treatment groups in terms of notable abnormalities or any relevant changes in these parameters from 
baseline. On ECG, 2 patients on the deferasirox 5 mg/kg/day group and one patient on the deferasirox 
10 mg/kg/day group had new or worsened clinically significant abnormalities; none was suspected to 
be related to study drug. Audiometric test, and ocular examinations showed no notable abnormalities. 
In Study A2202/E, 3 patients had AEs related to lens opacities, retinal changes and optic neuritis: 
2 patients with cataract (both in the core), and one patient with maculopathy (in extension). 
AEs related to hearing loss were reported for 5 patients. All hearing loss-related AEs were mild, none 
warranted a change in study medication and all were ongoing at the end of study (i.e. core or 
extension). Two patients (both in the 15 mg/kg/day groups) had hearing loss-related AEs that were 
considered related to study medication (one neurosensory hypoacusis (mild) and one hypoacusis 
(mild)). 
Safety in special populations 
AEs and laboratory results were analysed by demographic subgroups (gender, age, race), by baseline 
LIC and SF categories, and by underlying disease subgroups in Study A2209. No relevant differences 
were observed in the safety profile for deferasirox across demographic subgroups, underlying disease, 
or baseline LIC or SF categories, although the number of patients in each subgroup was small. No 
relevant differences were seen in the incidence of AEs when comparing patients with and without a 
dose increase.  
Study A2209 enrolled 21 patients who were <18 years old (6 and 7 patients in the deferasirox 5 and 
10 mg/kg/day groups, respectively, and 8 patients in the combined placebo group). The number of 
severe AEs was comparable between paediatric and adult population in deferasirox groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/44672/2013

Nausea occurred in two deferasirox-treated patients and one placebo-treated patient. Abdominal 
discomfort occurred in one placebo-treated patient. Rash occurred in three deferasirox-treated 
patients, and in one placebo-treated patient. 
No patients <18 years of age discontinued due to an AE. Two deferasirox-treated paediatric patients 
had a dose adjustment or interruption treatment due to an AE.  
None of the deferasirox- or placebo-treated paediatric patients showed : an >33% increase in serum 
creatinine above ULN on two consecutive occasions; a creatinine clearance values below 60 mL/min on 
two consecutive occasions or a UPCR > 1mg/mg on 2 consecutive occasions. 
One deferasirox-treated paediatric patient had at least one episode of AST increased from normal to 
>ULN and ≤5xULN. Four placebo-treated paediatric patients had at least one episode of AST increased 
from normal to >ULN and ≤5xULN.  
Two deferasirox-treated paediatric patient had at least one episode of ALT increased from normal to 
>ULN and ≤5xULN. Four placebo-treated paediatric patients had at least one episode of ALT increased 
from normal to >ULN and ≤5xULN.  
None of the deferasirox- or placebo-treated paediatric patients had a decrease in absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) below 1.5×109/L during the study.  
No subgroup analyses were performed for study A2202/E. No pregnancies were reported in this 
study. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study A2209 
Adverse events led to drug discontinuations in 8 patients. Two of these 8 patients discontinued due to 
pregnancy. Three patients (all on deferasirox) discontinued due to AEs considered related to study 
drug by the investigator: one patient with anaemia, one patient with proteinuria (after dose increase 
from 5 to 10mg/kg/day), and one patient with pruritus and rash (SAEs). The 3 remaining patients 
were a placebo treated patient with severe anaemia, a placebo-treated patient with optic neuritis (SAE) 
and a deferasirox 5 mg/kg/day-treated patient with a pelvic fracture (SAE). 
The incidence of AEs requiring dose adjustment or interruption of study drug in Study A2209 was 
21.8% and 18.2% for deferasirox 5 and 10 mg/kg/day groups, and 17.9% and 14.3% for placebo 
5 and 10 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Most preferred terms occurred in only one or two patients 
each. These are: blood creatinine increased, pyrexia, rash, anaemia, and influenza. 
Study 2202/E 
Out of the 8 discontinuations from the core study which occurred due to AEs (mainly increased 
transaminases), 5 occurred in the 15 mg/kg/day dose cohort (21.7%), while the remaining 3 (20%) 
occurred in the 10 mg/kg/day dose cohort. Two patients had increased transaminase (all in deferasirox 
15 mg/kg/day); other preferred terms were reported for only 1 patient each. 
Two discontinuations from the core plus extension study occurred due to AEs (diarrhoea and increased 
transaminases) in the 15 mg/kg/day dose cohort.  
Assessment report  
EMA/44672/2013  
Page 29/44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of AEs requiring a dose reduction or interruption was higher in the 15 mg/kg/day group 
(13 patients, 56.5%) and the 10 mg/kg/day group (6 patients, 40%) than in the 5 mg/kg/day group 
(1 patient, 9.1%). Most of these AEs were laboratory abnormalities (e.g., blood creatinine increased, 
ALT increased), or GI related (e.g., diarrhoea, nausea) and considered related to study drug. Renal 
impairment was reported for 2 patients; other preferred terms were reported for at most 1 patient 
each. 
Similarly to the core, the incidence of AEs requiring a dose reduction or interruption in the core plus 
extension was higher in the 15 mg/kg/day group (6 patients, 54.5%) than in the 10 mg/kg/day group 
(2 patients, 33.3%) and in the 5 mg/kg/day group (2 patients, 22.2%). Most of these AEs were 
laboratory abnormalities (e.g., increased creatinine or increased ALT); other preferred terms were 
headache, or related to rash, renal function, or GI disorders. Most of these AEs were considered 
related to study drug. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In general the safety profile was comparable to that already described for the other approved 
indications. 
The most frequent AEs (at least 10% in any deferasirox treatment group) in the NTDT patients (target 
population) were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia, and rash. 
The overall adverse event profile was consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and 
complications of underlying conditions. Both studies do not bring any new relevant information 
regarding the safety profile of Exjade. However, the number of young patients (aged of 10-18 years-
old) with NTDT is too low to draw any firm conclusion on the safety in this subpopulation (n=13 in 
deferasirox groups + 8 in cross over group participating in the one-year study extension).  
The renal risk with Exjade has been assessed. The planned duration of treatment in NTDT patients is 
still uncertain: firstly planned to be more or less one year, the median duration was established in 
study 2209 around 21 months (less than 2 years) depending of clinical features of the patients. In 
study 2209, to achieve the target LIC of 3 mg Fe/g dw in a patient with baseline LIC of 20mg/Fe/g dw, 
the mean treatment duration could reach 4.8 years [3.92 – 6.11] with a dose of 10mg/kg/day. One 
should consider the importance of renal risk in NTDT patients, with a long term exposure and 
especially in those patients in whom kidney function is often already compromised. It is difficult to 
assess whether renal toxicity can be manageable in these patients as the duration of treatment and 
dose tapering have not been addressed in the pivotal study. Indeed, one should keep in mind that 
deferasirox could be a long term treatment, and that renal dysfunction is a severe factor of morbidity. 
Available data do not allow affirming that there is a reversibility of the renal events associated with 
deferasirox use, after a drug interruption.  
Overall, renal and hepatic toxicities with Exjade therapy persist and are not yet fully understood: 
increases in serum creatinine might be manageable with dose reduction/interruption but cases of acute 
renal failure, some requiring dialysis, have also been reported following use of deferasirox. Risk 
minimisations are in place with respect to these issues. 
The risk of overchelation the NTDT population cannot be excluded in this population with moderate 
overload, especially when patients are exposed to 10mg/kg/day (even 20 mg/kg/day). The 
recommended doses and stopping rules when target LIC and SF were reached could be adequate to 
avoid this risk, and has been included in both SmPC and risk minimisation tools.  
Assessment report  
EMA/44672/2013  
Page 30/44 
 
 
 
 
 
Study A2209 only included 21 patients (n=13 in deferasirox groups + 8 in cross over group 
participating in the one-year study extension) under 18 years old (ie 12,7% of patients included) which 
is very few to draw any firm conclusion on efficacy and safety in this population. Therefore, a close 
follow-up of these patients is essential and risk minimisation measures should be strengthened. The 
SmPC includes a specific warning concerning uncertainties on consequences of a long-term exposure in 
this category of patients 
Specifically for paediatric population, a warning for prescribers on the necessity of closer monitoring of 
LIC and SF and on the uncertainties of the safety consequences in the long term treatment has been 
included in the risk minimization activities.  
Furthermore, as an obligation to conduct post-authorisation measure, the MAH should conduct an 
observational study (cohort) for all paediatric NTDT patients over 10 years-old for whom deferoxamine 
is contra-indicated or inadequate (as the registry performed for patients between 2 and 5 years-old) in 
order to obtain long-term safety data from a significative sample of paediatic patients in real life. A 
specific section for paediatric NTDT patients in the future PSURs should also be provided.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:  
• 
The MAH should conduct an observational study (cohort) for all paediatric NTDT patients over 
10 years-old for whom deferoxamine is contra-indicated or inadequate (as the registry 
performed for patients between 2 and 5 years-old) in order to obtain long-term safety data 
from a significative sample of paediatic patients in real life, with the following timeframe: 
o  Submission of feasibility assessment: April 2013  
o  Submission of protocol: after CHMP review of feasibility assessment 
o  Annual updates on enrolment will be provided 
o  Annual updates of 5-year results of patients enrolled will be provided. 
o  Final Clinical study report to be submitted by June 2021 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure which included a 
risk minimisation plan.

2012 
The following updates to the additional risk minimisation activities were required:  
The physician information for use of Exjade in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia 
(NTDT) syndromes should contain the following key elements: 
Information that only one course of treatment is proposed for NTDT patients 
o 
o  The recommended doses and the rules for starting treatment 
o  The rules for stopping when target liver iron concentration and serum ferritin are 
reached 
o  A warning to minimise the risk of over-chelation 
o  A warning on the necessity of closer monitoring of liver iron concentration and serum 
ferritin in the paediatric population 
o  A warning on the currently unknown safety consequences of long-term treatment in 
the paediatric population and the need to detect side effects 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Exjade is an efficient oral iron chelator already approved to reverse iron overload and maintain normal 
values  in  patients  suffering  from  various  transfusion  dependent  conditions.  An  iron  chelating  agent 
permit  to  achieve  safe  levels  of  body  iron.  This  is  a  slow  process  because  only  a  small  proportion  of 
body iron is available for chelation at any moment.  
The pivotal study A2209 was a phase II randomised double blind placebo controlled study designed to 
assess  the  efficacy  and  the  safety  of  deferasirox  in  NTDT  patients  (aged  >10  years-old)  with  iron 
overload. One hundred and sixty-six (166) patients were included and followed during 52 weeks. The 
supportive study A2202 was designed to determine both safety and efficacy of deferasirox in a limited 
number of adult patients (49) with iron overload from hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Study A2209 
results  showed  a  decrease  in  iron  overload  in  patients  with  NTDT.  The  effect  seems  dose-dependent. 
On  average,  liver  iron  concentration  decreased  by  3.80  mg  Fe/g  dw  in  patients  treated  with  EXJADE 
(starting  dose  10  mg/kg/day)  and  increased  by  0.38  mg  Fe/g  dw  in  patients  treated  with  placebo 
(p<0.001).  On  average,  serum  ferritin  decreased  by  222.0  µg/l  in  patients  treated  with  EXJADE 
(starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 115 µg/l in patients treated with placebo (p<0.001). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
There was no prospective challenge of any long-term treatment (with stopping rules after correction, 
maintenance recommendations and planned re-introduction of Exjade). Data showing that deferasirox 
was not only an active iron chelator, but can also be used a safe and efficient drug in NTDT patients on 
a long term ware thus lacking. No information is available on retreatment to correct a relapsed 
Assessment report  
EMA/44672/2013  
Page 37/44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overload. As a consequence, retreatment cannot be recommended as indicated in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. 
There was no direct comparison with deferoxamine, the current gold standard in secondary 
hemosiderosis, to demonstrate that inferior efficacy or safety can be 
 excluded. Thus, the use of Exjade in NTDT should be limited when deferoxamine therapy is 
contraindicated or inadequate. 
Data in NTDT children are limited as only 21 paediatric patients were included in the study A2209 (with 
solely 13 patients in deferasirox groups). As a consequence, a warning has been included in section 4.4 
of the SmPC to inform prescriber and highlight that paediatric patients should be closely monitored. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the most frequent AEs (at least 10% in any deferasirox treatment group) in the NTDT patients 
(target population) were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia, and 
rash. In general the safety profile can be considered as comparable to that one already described for 
the other approved indications. 
The overall adverse event profile was consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and 
complications of underlying conditions. Both studies (A2209 and A2202) provided in the context of this 
submission do not bring any new relevant information regarding the safety profile of Exjade. However, 
the number of paediatric patients (aged of 10-18 years-old) with NTDT was too low (n=13 in 
deferasirox groups) to draw any firm conclusion on the safety in this subpopulation.  
Although no renal tubular damage were reported in the study population, the renal risk with Exjade is 
recognised and the mechanism of this risk is not yet fully understood.  
As the planned duration of treatment in NTDT patients varies (more or less one year) depending of 
clinical features of the patients, of the renal risk in NTDT patients, with a long term exposure and 
especially in those patients in whom kidney function is often already compromised, should be carefully 
considered. It is difficult to assess whether renal toxicity can be manageable in these patients as the 
duration of treatment and dose tapering have not been addressed in the pivotal study. Indeed, 
deferasirox could be a long term treatment, and renal dysfunction is a severe factor of morbidity. The 
data provided do not allow affirming that there is a reversibility of the renal events associated with 
deferasirox use, after a drug interruption. As a consequence, retreatment cannot be recommended. 
No new safety information related to hepatotoxicity have been reported;  a close monitoring should be 
maintained in this population as per the current SmPC recommendation in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Overchelation cannot be excluded in this population with moderate overload, especially when patients 
are exposed to 10mg/kg/day. Due to an increased potential risk of overchelation, a close monitoring of 
deferasirox treatment is warranted particularly in patients affected by HbE beta-thalassemia or alpha-
thalassemia. The hypothesis of overchelation as a possible mechanism to explain the renal finding was 
considered interesting but not sufficient to explain the renal disorders associated with deferasirox. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/44672/2013

potential risk of overchelation could be addressed by the LIC and SF treatment stopping rules as well 
as the close monitoring and dosing recommendations as included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Further data are needed to address concerns on the ong term safety  (particularly with respect to renal 
and hepatic toxicity) in paediatric patients, in view  of the potential long term duration of therapy.As a 
consequence, risk minimisation measures concerning the paediatric population have been be 
strengthened. 
Specifically for paediatric population, a warning for prescribers on the necessity of closer monitoring of 
LIC and SF and on the uncertainties of the safety consequences in the long term treatment should be 
include in the product information and risk minimization educational materials.  
Furthermore, the MAH will conduct an observational study (cohort) withpaediatric NTDT patients over 
10 years-old for whom deferoxamine is contra-indicated or inadequate in order to obtain long-term 
safety data from a significant sample of paediatic patients in real life. A specific section for paediatric 
NTDT patients in the future PSURs should also be provided.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Exjade is an efficient oral iron chelator already approved to reverse iron overload and maintain normal 
values in patients suffering from various transfusion dependent conditions. An iron chelating agent 
permit to achieve safe levels of body iron. This is a slow process because only a small proportion of 
body iron is available for chelation at any moment.  
Study 2209 results (submitted in the context of the indication extension for NTDT patients over 10 
years-old) show a decrease in iron overload in patients with NTDT. The effect seems dose-dependent. 
On average, liver iron concentration decreased by 3.80 mg Fe/g dw in patients treated with EXJADE 
(starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 0.38 mg Fe/g dw in patients treated with placebo 
(p<0.001). On average, serum ferritin decreased by 222.0 µg/l in patients treated with EXJADE 
(starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 115 µg/l in patients treated with placebo (p<0.001).  
Overall, the most frequent AEs (at least 10% in any deferasirox treatment group) in the NTDT patients 
(target population) were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia, and 
rash. In general the safety profile can be considered as comparable to that one already described for 
the other approved indications. The renal risk with Exjade has been recognised (renal risk mechanism 
is not yet fully understood).  
However, as there was no comparison with the standard of care deferoxamine to demonstrate that loss 
of chance can be excluded (due to low efficacy or poor safety profile), the use of Exjade should be 
limited to NTDT patients when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
Furthermore, in view of the uncertainties of long-term use and lack of information on retreatment, the 
use of Exjade in these patients should be limited to a single course of treatment. 
Finally, the long-term safety in paediatric patients needs to be closely monitored, through additional 
risk minimisation, PSURs and an observational cohort study.

Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk of Exjade in NTDT was positive in a restricted 
indication for patients aged 10 years and older when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or 
inadequate. The CHMP also considered that based on the data available, retreatment cannot be 
recommended. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balanceDue to the lack of comparison with deferoxamine (gold standard 
for secondary hemosiderosis) and so the potential loss of chance for these patients, the use of Exjade 
should in NTDT should be limited to patients when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or 
inadequate.  
Due to uncertainties regarding long-term use and lack of information on retreatment with Exjade in 
NTDT patients, the use should be limited to only one single course of treatment. Also, to address the 
risk of potential overchelation, a close monitoring of efficacy parameters is needed, with SF to be 
evaluated monthlyand even in children where LIC should be assessed every 3 months when serum 
ferritin (SF) levels reach the limit of 800ng/ml. 
Additionally, in order to ensure a narrow monitoring of the NTDT patients with thalassemia syndromes, 
recommended doses and starting/stopping rules when target LIC and SF are reached have been 
included in the product information as well as additional risk minimisation activities (i.e. educational 
materials). 
Moreover, uncertainties remain concerning the long term use of Exjade, particularly in paediatric 
patients where data are very limited. As a consequence  the long-term safety in paediatric patients 
needs to be closely monitored, through additional risk minimisation, PSURs (with a specific section on 
paediatric NTDT patients) and an observational cohort study. 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk of Exjade in NTDT was positive in a restricted 
indication for patients aged 10 years and older when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or 
inadequate. The CHMP also considered that based on the data available, retreatment cannot be 
recommended.

4.  Changes to the Product Information 
The CHMP finally agreed to the following indication to be added in section 4.1 of the SmPC: 
“EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when 
deferoxamine  therapy  is  contraindicated  or  inadequate  in  patients  with  non-transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older.” 
In addition, consequently to this new indication, section 4.2 of the SmPC was updated with respect to 
the  posology  requirements  in  NTDT,  a  warning  was  added  in  section  4.4  due  to  the  limited  data  in 
paediatric patients and need for close monitoring. Section 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were also update 
with  information  on  the  clinical  trials  conducted  in  NTDT  patients.  The  Package  leaflet  was  updated 
accordingly. 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  PI  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  current  Agency/QRD  template,  SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s), which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
User consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet was submitted at the time of the 
initial marketing authorisation of Exjade. The MAH considered that no user consultation was required 
for this application as no significant changes were made to the package leaflet, which was accepted by 
the CHMP. 
5.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
New indication of Exjade for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5. of 
the SmPC and the package leaflet have been updated. Annex II has also been updated to include an 
obligation to conduct a post-authorisation measure. The Marketing Authorisation Holder also took the 
opportunity to update the product information with the latest QRD template (version 8.1).  
The requested variation proposed amendments to: Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1. of the 
Marketing Authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

Introduction 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) is the salt of the oral prodrug of tenofovir. Tenofovir, a 
nucleoside  monophosphate  (nucleotide)  analogue  is  metabolised  to  the  active  metabolite,  tenofovir 
diphosphate,  a  competitive  inhibitor  of  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  type  1  (HIV-1)  reverse 
transcriptase.  Tenofovir  has  an  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  antiviral  activity  against  retroviruses  and 
hepadnaviruses, including HIV-2 and hepatitis B Virus (HBV).  
Viread (tenofovir DF), 245 mg film coated tablets in a once daily regimen is approved in the European 
Union (EU) for the therapeutic management of HIV-1 infected adult patients since 5 February 2002.  
Tenofovir  DF  is  also  approved  in  fixed-dose  combination  products  (emtricitabine/tenofovir  DF  and 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir  DF)  for  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  infected  adult  patients  as  part  of  a 
combination antiretroviral therapy. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for an extension of the therapeutic indication of 
Viread  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  Hepatitis  B  adult  patients  in  the  present  type  II  variation 
application. 
Hepatitis B infection represents a major global health problem with nearly 350 million people being 
infected.  In  Europe  the  carrier  rate  varies  from  around  0.5%  in  the  northern  regions  to  1-8%  in  the 
Mediterranean and Eastern regions. The goal of therapy in chronic hepatitis B infected adult patients is 
to prevent progression to cirrhosis and /or hepatocellular carcinoma and the current treatment strategy 
is  the  achievement  of  a  profound  and  durable  suppression  of  HBV  DNA.  Current  inter-/national 
guidelines  recommend  treatment  in  patients  with  HBeAg-positive  and  HBeAg-negative  chronic 
hepatitis  B  with  moderate/severe  hepatitis  on  biopsy,  serum  HBV  DNA  (>105  copies/ml  and  >104 
copies/ml, respectively) and elevated ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels. 
Currently available treatment options include in addition to interferon the following anti-virals: 
(cid:131)  Lamivudine: rapid development of resistance if used as monotherapy (about 2/3 after 4 years); 
(cid:131)  Adefovir dipivoxil: estimated cumulative resistance at 5 year about 25%; 
(cid:131)  Entecavir: reduced activity in case of lamivudine resistance; 
(cid:131)  Telbivudine: selects for mutants cross-resistant to lamivudine/entecavir. Sparse long-term data 
available; 
There  is  a  medical  need  for  new  therapeutic  options  for  naïve  patients  as  well  as  for  patients  with 
resistant  HBV  with  improved  efficacy  and  safety  profiles,  with  durable  response  and  with  low 
potential for developing viral resistance.  
Non-clinical aspects 
Comprehensive non-clinical study programmes have been performed and reviewed at the time of the 
Marketing  Authorisation  Applications  (MAA)  of  tenofovir  DF,  or  fixed  combination  products  with 
tenofovir  DF,  for  the  treatment  of  HIV  infection.  A  summary  of  non-clinical  pharmacokinetics  and 
toxicology with the key findings was submitted together with new non-clinical pharmacology data in 
relation to the applied therapeutic indication.  
Pharmacology 
Mechanism of action 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is converted to tenofovir by serum esterases. Intracellularly, tenofovir is 
phosphorylated into its active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate was reported 
in  human  hepatic  cells,  and  in  primary  human  hepatocytes  with  a  half  life  of  95  hours.  Tenofovir 
diphosphate  inhibited  recombinant  HBV  polymerase  with  a  kinetic  inhibition  constant  (Ki)  of 
0.18 μmol/l.  Inhibition  of  viral  polymerases  occurs  by  direct  binding  competition  with  the  natural 
deoxyribonucleotide  substrate  (deoxyadenosine  triphosphate  -  dATP)  and,  after  incorporation  into 
DNA, by DNA chain termination.

In vitro anti-HBV activity 
The  in  vitro  antiviral  activity  of  tenofovir  against  an  HBV  laboratory  strain,  assessed  in  the  HepG2 
2.2.15 cell line, was characterised by EC50 values in the range of 0.14 to 1.5 μmol/l, with CC50 (50% 
cytotoxicity concentration) values > 100  μmol/l. Tenofovir inhibited various wild-type HBV clinical 
isolates (genotypes A, C, D) with a comparable activity with values ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 μmol/l. 
In vitro resistance 
No  HBV  polymerase  mutations  associated  with  resistance  to  tenofovir  DF  have  been  currently 
identified.  
An  HBV  rtA194T  mutation,  developed  in  the  background  of  the  rtL180M+rtM204V  lamivudine 
associated  combined  mutation,  was  reported  in  two  patients  receiving  antiretroviral  treatments 
including  tenofovir  DF  and  lamivudine.  Studies  showed  that  rtA194T  mutation  alone  has  no 
significant  effect  on  tenofovir  DF  susceptibility  (1.5-fold  increase  in  tenofovir  EC50).  The  rtA194T 
mutation in combination with the rtL180M+rtM204V mutations led to a 2.4-fold increase in tenofovir 
EC50 which is not significantly different from the 2.1-fold increase observed with rtL180M+rtM204V 
mutations alone.  
Clinical studies have shown that tenofovir DF inhibited lamivudine-resistant HBV suggesting that a 2- 
to 3- fold change in in vitro susceptibility to tenofovir is not clinically relevant.  
Tenofovir  DF  demonstrated  similar  activity  against  all  four  major  patterns  of  lamivudine  resistance 
mutations identified in patients who failed lamivudine therapy.

In  cell  based  assays,  HBV  strains  expressing  the  rtV173L,    rtL180M,  and  rtM204I/V  mutations 
associated  with  resistance  to  lamivudine  and  telbivudine  showed  a  susceptibility  to  tenofovir  DF 
ranging from 0.7 to 3.4-fold that of wild type virus. 
HBV  strains  expressing  rtA181V  and  rtN236T  mutations  associated  with  resistance  to  adefovir 
dipivoxil showed a 2.9- to 4.5-fold reduced sensitivity to tenofovir DF in vitro. The effects of other 
adefovir  resistance  associated  mutations  or  combinations  of  mutations,  rtA181T,  rtA181V/rtN236T 
and  rtA181T/rtN236T  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  susceptibility  to  tenofovir  of  1.5-,  10-  and  3.0-fold 
each, respectively. The clinical significance of these in vitro results is currently unknown.

The mutations conferring resistance to entecavir have been identified as changes at rtI169T, rtT184G, 
rtS202I/G and rtM250V in combination with the pre-existing lamivudine resistance mutations. In vitro 
phenotypic  analysis  showed  that  the  tested  entecavir  resistance  mutations  resulted  in  increased  EC50 
values for tenofovir DF ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold.

In  vitro  activity  of  tenofovir  is  similar  to  that  of  adefovir.  Combinations  of  tenofovir  DF  with 
lamivudine,  telbivudine,  entecavir,  adefovir  and  emtricitabine  resulted  in  additive  to  slightly 
synergistic  anti-HBV  activity.  Tenofovir  DF  has  shown  activity  against  lamivudine,  telbivudine  and 
entecavir  resistant  HBV  and  appears  to  retain  activity  against  some  adefovir  resistant  HBV  strains. 
Mutations in the HBV polymerase associated with resistance to tenofovir DF are currently unknown.  
In vivo efficacy in animal models 
An  in  vivo  study  in  HBV  infected  woodchucks  showed  that  tenofovir  DF  administered  orally  at  15 
mg/kg  for  48  weeks  produced  a  mean  serum  viral  load  reduction  of  2.9  log10  copies/ml  and 
combination with  lamivudine  or  emtricitabine  resulted  in  a  reduction  of  5.8  and  6.1  log10  copies/ml, 
respectively. There was no evidence of toxicity in woodchucks treated with tenofovir DF, either alone 
or in combination. There were 11 deaths during the study. Post mortem findings in 7 cases included 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Group sizes were small to allow a definitive conclusion. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of tenofovir/tenofovir DF were evaluated in a 
variety  of  animal  models  in  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicokinetic  studies  at  the  time  of  the  MAA  of 
tenofovir  DF,  or  fixed  combination  products  with  tenofovir  DF.  In  addition,  the  in  vitro  interaction 
profile was characterised with human cytochrome 450 (CYP) isoforms and renal transporters. 
Upon hydrolysis, the prodrug forms two molecules of formaldehyde for each molecule of the active 
compound.  Formaldehyde  exposure  was  estimated  to  be  0.5  mg/kg/day  for  a  70  kg  person.  The 
potential  effects  of  formaldehyde  were  discussed  in  a  comprehensive  summary  of  long  term  oral 
studies  in  rats.  Based  on  a  no-observed-effect  level  (NOEL)  of  30  mg/kg/day  for  gastro-intestinal  
toxicity in the chronic rat study, a 6-fold safety margin relative to formaldehyde exposure in humans 
following  a  300-mg/day  dose  of  tenofovir  DF  could  be  determined.  Mouse  and  rat  carcinogenicity 
studies  previously  performed,  concluded  that  there  were  no  significant  concerns,  regarding  the 
carcinogenic potential of tenofovir DF in patients.  
Little or no inhibition of CYP P450 isozymes was observed in human hepatic microsomes. The protein 
binding of tenofovir DF was low. Tenofovir was excreted unchanged in the urine of all animal species 
tested,  and  renal  excretion  was  identified  as  the  primary  route  of  elimination.  Results  of  in  vitro 
studies indicate that active renal tubular secretion of tenofovir DF in humans is mediated by the uptake 
of tenofovir from the plasma into proximal tubule cells by the influx transporters hOAT1 and hOAT3 
(human  organic  anion  transporters  1  and  3)  and  its  efflux  from  proximal  cells  into  the  urine  by  the 
MRP4 (multidrug resistant protein 4). The active transporters involved in the luminal transport and the 
possibility of polymorphism in these were further discussed has predictor factors of renal toxicity. The 
currently available information is limited and not consensual to allow a conclusion. 
Toxicology 
High doses of tenofovir DF have been coupled to nephrotoxicity resulting in acute renal failure. No 
effect dose levels were identified in monkey and dogs. Clinical data on long-term use of tenofovir DF 
Page 4 of 22 
 
 
  
 
in  HIV-1 infected  patients  suggests  no  causal  association  between  tenofovir  DF  therapy  and  renal 
events.  However,  postmarketing  safety  data  indicates  that  tenofovir  DF  may,  in  rare  circumstances, 
cause  renal  adverse  reactions,  including  renal  failure,  Fanconi  syndrome,  and  other  proximal 
tubulopathies.  
The  potential  for  renal  toxicity  of  tenofovir  DF  is  well  known  and  has  been  documented  clinically. 
Management of the risk of renal toxicity is recommended in the product information.  
In  rat  and  monkey,  tenofovir  DF  was  shown  to  decrease  serum  phosphate  levels.  Clinical  data 
(studies GS-98-902 and GS-99-907) showed that the incidence of hypophosphatemia in the tenofovir 
DF group was slightly higher than in the placebo group following 24 weeks of treatment (13% vs 8% 
of patients). The rate of occurrence of hypophosphatemia does not appear to increase over time.  
In  non-clinical  studies,  the  bone  was  a  target  organ  (osteomalacia  or  reduction  in  bone  mineral 
density).  Currently,  there  is  no  evidence  from  clinical  studies  that  dosing  with  tenofovir  DF  is 
associated with an increased risk of fractures. Long-term clinical data demonstrated a minimal risk of 
bone  toxicity.  Osteomalacia,  occurring  as  a  result  of  tenofovir  DF  associated  proximal  tubulopathy, 
was identified as a rare adverse reaction during postmarketing surveillance. 
No  marked  hepatotoxicity  of  tenofovir  DF  was  reported  in  non-clinical  studies.  Tenofovir  is  not 
metabolised, does not interact significantly with P450 enzymes, and is not excreted to any significant 
extent  by  the  liver.  Results  from  a  pharmacokinetic  study  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment 
demonstrated  that  tenofovir  DF  300  mg  once  daily  may  be  administered  without  regard  to  hepatic 
function.  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  ecotoxicology/environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  according  to  the  currently  applicable 
guidelines  was  submitted.  In  Phase  I  a  worst-case  PEC  (predicted  environmental  concentration)  in 
surface  water  of  3.0  µg/l  was  calculated.  This  was  higher  than  the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/l  and  a 
Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis was performed. 
The phase II analysis did not indicate any environmental concerns with the use of tenofovir DF. The 
final  report  of  study  AD-104-2007  (Tenofovir  Disoproxil  Fumarate  −  Aerobic  and  Anaerobic 
Transformation  in  Aquatic  Sediment  Systems  Following  OECD  Guideline  308)  for  which  interim 
results were available will be provided as a post-approval follow-up measure. 
Clinical aspects 
The main clinical data to support this application included efficacy and safety information of tenofovir 
DF 300 mg once daily in patients with chronic HBV from two identical randomised, 48 week double-
blind, controlled phase III studies evaluating tenofovir DF vs adefovir dipivoxil:

Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The results of pharmacokinetic studies of tenofovir DF, including studies in HIV-1 infected subjects, 
special populations, and drug interaction studies, have been previously submitted and are reflected in 
the product information for Viread.  
One new clinical pharmacology study (GS-US-174-105) was submitted. This is an interaction study, 
evaluating  potential  pharmacokinetic  interaction  between  tacrolimus  and  the  fixed-dose  combination 
of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF. 
Target population 
No pharmacokinetics studies have been performed with tenofovir DF in patients with hepatitis B virus 
infection.  Due  to  the  renal  excretion  of  tenofovir  and  to  the  low  degree  of  protein  binding  no 
pharmacokinetic differences are expected as compared to healthy subjects. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  tenofovir  DF  in  non−HIV-1  and  non-HBV  infected  subjects  with 
either normal renal function or varying degrees of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD)  requiring  hemodialysis,  is  mainly  based  on  study  GS-01-919  results.  The  current  dosing 
recommendation  (interval  adjustment)  in  HIV-1  infected  patients  with  various  degrees  of  renal 
impairment is based on limited data and at the time considered not an optimal option. However, as no 
other  alternative  dosage  formulation  was  available  and  due  to  the  identified  medical  need  it  was 
agreed not to absolute contraindicate the use of tenofovir DF in severe renal impairment HIV infected 
patients. 
The  main  clinical  studies  submitted  in  support  of  tenofovir  DF  in  HBV  infected  patients,  excluded 
patients  with  creatinine  clearance  <70  ml/min.  This  again  raised  concerns  regarding 
the 
appropriateness  of  the  current  dose  recommendation  in  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe  renal 
impairment in cases where treatment benefit outweighs the risk in this new patient population.  
The  MAH  presented  simulated  tenofovir  steady-state  pharmacokinetic  parameters  following  dose-
interval  adjustment  for  subjects  with  varying  degrees  of  renal  impairment  from  study  GS-01-919 
(Table  4),  based  on  which  estimations  for  each  24  hours  over  the  week  were  done  in  subjects  with 
severe renal impairment (Table 5).

Even considering that the estimated in vitro hepatocellular half-life is 95 hours, the consequences of 
having Cmin values ranging from 1.75 to 157 (Table 4) in the severe renal impairment group and with 
a dosing interval of 72-96 hours cannot be clearly determined.  
The  exposure  for  each  24  hours  for  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  illustrates  variability  in 
addition to difference in renal function. The exposure is very high during the days of dosing (3-6 times 
higher than subjects with creatinine clearance >50 ml/min but with a wide range at later hours). The 
CHMP  agrees  that  the  current  dosing  is  not  optimal.  However,  it  is  acknowledge  that  due  to 
circumstances of medical need, in which tenofovir DF could be the only option even in the setting of 
moderate  or  severe  renal  compromise  with  end-stage  liver  disease,  lamivudine-resistant  virus  or 
persistent viral replication on adefovir dipivoxil treatment, the CHMP agrees that tenofovir DF should 
not be absolute contraindicated in severe renal impairment patients. Rather a strong warning stressing 
that  tenofovir  DF  should  only  be  used  in  patients  with  chronic  HB  and  moderate/severe  renal 
impairment,  if  the  potential  benefits  of  treatment  outweigh  the  potential  risks,  was  included  in  the 
SPC. Consequently the wording on dosing regimens was amended. 
The  MAH  committed  to  generate  additional  data  in  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe  renal 
impairment  and  chronic  HBV  infection,  including  safety  data  and  steady-state  pharmacokinetics. A 
comprehensive  plan  of  action  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  approval  for  the  hepatitis  B 
indication.  A  new  study  in  HBV  patients  with  decompensated  liver  disease with  baseline  creatinine 
clearance  between  20  and  60  ml/min  will  be  submitted, and  data  will  be  collected  from  2  ongoing 
studies (study GS-203-107 in stable subjects who have undergone orthotopic liver transplantation with 
calculated clearance ≥ 40 ml/min and study GS-174-108 in subjects with decompensated liver disease 
with calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min).  
In  addition  to  the  above  plans  pertaining  to  moderate/severe  renal  impairment,  there  will  be  a  250-
patient,  multicenter,  randomised  study  including  participants  with  mild  renal  impairment  (creatinine 
clearance ≥ 50 ml/min) and lamivudine-resistant HBV.  
Furthermore, the MAH has undertaken the post-approval commitment to provide the CHMP with the 
status of the development of an alternative dosage formulation.

The  pharmacokinetics  of  tenofovir  after  a  300  mg  dose  of  tenofovir  DF  were  studied  in  non  HIV-1 
infected  patients  with  varying  degrees  of  hepatic  impairment  according  to  the  Child-Pugh-Turcotte 
(CPT)  classification  (Study  GS-01-931  A/B).  Tenofovir  pharmacokinetics  were  not  substantially 
altered as compared with unimpaired patients. No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
Gender  
An Ad hoc analysis of study GS-US-174-102 comparing tenofovir DF pharmacokinetic parameters in 
female and male subjects with chronic HB showed no major difference in plasma pharmacokinetics. 
However, based on the average profiles it seems as the plasma concentration time profile differs i.e. 
females have higher Cmax (65%) and slightly higher AUCtau (22%). From the findings in the HIV 
Page 7 of 22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
programme  it  is  agreed  that  in  general  tenofovir  plasma  exposure  are  similar  between  females  and 
males.   
Elderly 
Pharmacokinetics has not been studied in the elderly population (subjects>65). Considering that this 
population is more likely to have a decreased renal function, caution should be exercised when treating 
elderly with tenofovir DF. 
Interactions 
Study GS-US-174-105, an open-label, randomised, three-way crossover study evaluated the effect of 
coadministration  of  tacrolimus  on  the  steady-state  pharmacokinetics  of  emtricitabine/tenofovir  DF 
fixed  dose  combination  in  31  healthy  volunteers  (18-45  years  of  age).  The  pharmacokinetics  of 
tacrolimus was not altered upon coadministration with emtricitabine/tenofovir DF.  
The  geometric  mean  Cmax  for  tenofovir  was  the  only  pharmacokinetic  parameter  with  the  90% 
confidence intervals (CI) upper bound above the predefined limit of 125%. The 13% increase in Cmax 
of tenofovir in the presence of tacrolimus, is unlikely to be of clinical relevance.  
The  possibility  that  tacrolimus  inhibits  any  of  the  transport  proteins  involved  in  active  secretion  of 
tenofovir,  potentially  increasing  the  risk  for  renal  toxicity  was  further  discussed,  as  well  as  other 
possible inhibitors of transport proteins (e.g cyclosporine) expected to interact with the luminal efflux 
transport.  Based  on  the  currently  available  data,  no  renal  drug  interactions  caused  by  inhibition  of 
these transport proteins have been identified. 
All  clinically  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interactions  between  tenofovir  DF  and  other  antiretroviral 
drugs tested are reflected in the interaction section of the SPC. Furthermore, it has been shown that the 
co-administration  of  atazanavir/ritonavir  or  lopinavir/ritonavir  with  tenofovir DF  increased  tenofovir 
exposure. A precautionary statement was included in the SPC to inform prescribers that, in case of co-
administration,  the  higher  tenofovir  concentrations  could  potentiate  tenofovir  associated  adverse 
events, including renal disorders. In vitro studies suggested that the  mechanism is  mediated through 
inhibition of intestinal p-glycoprotein (p-gp) by these protease inhibitors. 
Based on raw data no interactions have been currently observed between entecavir and tenofovir DF. 
This information is reflected in the interactions table of the product information.  
No  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interactions  have  been  identified  when  a  single-dose  of  adefovir 
dipivoxil was co-administered with tenofovir DF in healthy volunteers. However, given their common 
renal  toxicity,  their  co-administration  is  not  recommended.  A  warning  statement  was  therefore 
included in the SPC and referred in the interactions table. 
Clinical efficacy 
Dose-response studies 
No dose-activity studies were conducted in patients with chronic HB. The Ki of tenofovir against HBV 
polymerase (0.18 µmol/l) was similar to the Ki against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (0.02-1.6 µmol/l).  
Similar  concentration  produced  50%  inhibition  of  viral  replication  (EC50)  in vitro  (HBV  EC50 = 
0.14−2.5 μmol/l, HIV EC50 = 0.5−2.2 μmol/l). Since 300 mg of tenofovir DF has been established as 
the optimal dose for HIV-1, it is also considered to be optimal for HBV.  
However, given the potency of the drug, it cannot be excluded that a lower dose could have allowed to 
obtain an acceptable efficacy level with an improved renal tolerance as compared to that observed in 
HIV infected patients.  
Main Studies 
The 48 week results from two pivotal phase III studies (GS-US-174-102 and GS-US-174-103) were 
submitted. These studies were similar in design, involving 48 weeks of double blind therapy with TDF 
300  mg  once  daily  (QD)  or  adefovir  dipivoxil  (ADV)  10  mg  QD,  followed  by  open-label  TDF 
treatment  through  week  240  (ongoing).  An  overview  of  the  main  clinical  studies  is  presented  in  the 
table below.

The inclusion criterion on renal function was considered too restrictive. Although the criteria for study 
-103 seemed consistent with the inclusion of the HBeAg+ target population on need for HBV therapy, 
a necroinflammatory score ≥ 4 (rather than ≥ 3) should have preferably been chosen. 
Endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  both  studies  was  complete  response  at  week  48  (HBV  DNA 
levels < 400 copies/ml  and  histologic  improvement  defined  as  at  least  a  2-point  reduction  in  the 
Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in Knodell fibrosis score). 
The secondary endpoints included histology, virologic response, biochemical and serology response, 
and genotypic changes from baseline. 
In line with the EU guideline on anti-HBV drugs development the composite primary endpoint should 
have encompassed the biochemical response. The MAH was therefore requested to present the studies 
results  as  recommended  in  the  guideline,  i.e.  combining  virological,  histological  and  biochemical 
response (see the “efficacy results” below). 
Statistical analysis 
For both studies, primary efficacy analyses were performed using the randomised-and-treated (RAT) 
analysis set, which included all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of study 
medication, with no data exclusion.  
The population for ALT normalisation analyses was all RAT subjects with an ALT value above the 
ULN  at  baseline.  In  study  -102  subjects  with  a  normal  ALT  value  at  baseline  were  excluded  from 
these analyses. This population is referred to as the biochemically evaluable RAT analysis set. 
For study -103 the population for analyses of HBeAg loss and seroconversion was all RAT subjects 
with a baseline value of positive for HBeAg status. Subjects with a value of negative at baseline for 
HBeAg  were  excluded  from  all  serology  related  analyses.  This  population  is  referred  to  as  the 
serologically evaluable RAT analysis set. 
Efficacy  analyses  were  adjusted  for  the  covariate  baseline  ALT  (≤ 2 ×  ULN  or  > 2× ULN  for  study  
-102 and ≤ 4 × ULN or > 4 × ULN for  study -103) but not for the geographical region nor for prior 
lamivudine or emtricitabine experience for study -102.

Results 
Population  
The majority of patients in both studies completed the first year of blinded treatment: 95.6% (239/250) 
in  the  TDF  group  vs  92.8%  (116/125) in  the  ADV  group  in  study  -102  and  89.8%  (158/176)  in  the 
TDF group vs 93.3% (84/91) in the ADV group in study -103.  
In  both  studies,  screening  failure  accounted  for  nearly  70%  due  to  failure  in  meeting  the  eligibility 
criteria for ALT levels, HBV DNA levels, or both. The ALT criterion was the main reason for screen 
failure in both studies, in a higher percentage in HBeAg+ study (30% in study -103 vs 17% in study -
102). The lower bound for ALT criteria for HBeAg+ patients was consistent with the EU guidelines. 
These screening failures do not hamper the extrapolation of the data to the target population in clinical 
practice.  
Some demographic and baseline disease characteristics of patients from studies -102 and -103 (RAT 
population) are displayed in Table 6, below. Seven and 6 patients did not receive study medication in 
study -102 and -103, respectively.

For  both  studies,  the  baseline  characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  the  tenofovir  and  the 
adefovir  treatment  groups.  The  European  population  was  well  represented  (62.4%  in  study  102  and 
54.9% in study 103). The genotype distribution reflects the ethnicity of the enrolled patients.  
Approximately  17%  and  16%  of  patients  in  study  -102  and  -103  respectively  had  prior  interferon 
exposure.   
Overall  approximately  20%  percent  of  patients  in  study  -102  had  cirrhosis  at  baseline;  a  similar 
percentage was seen in study -103, 18%.

Efficacy results  
An overview of the efficacy endpoints achieved in both studies is shown in the following table: 
Study -102 
The mean reduction from baseline in plasma HBV DNA at week 48 was significantly greater in the 
tenofovir  DF  group  (−4.57  log10  copies/ml)  than  in  the  adefovir  dipivoxil  group  ((−4.07  log10 
copies/ml  (p  <  0.001)).  Nearly  all  subjects  treated  with  tenofovir  DF  reached  the  assay  LLQ  (lower 
limit of quantification).  
Most biochemically evaluable subjects in both groups had normalised ALT at week 16 even though at 
baseline, normal ALT was uncommon (5.6% in both groups).  
At week 48, mean change from baseline in ALT was −95.0 U/l (102.31) in the tenofovir DF group and 
was  −124.4  U/l  (137.23) in  the  adefovir  dipivoxil group  (p  = 0.040).  Mean  (SD)  baseline  ALT  was 
higher,  however,  in  the  adefovir  group  (163.6  U/l  [146.02])  than  in  the  tenofovir  group  (127.5  U/l 
[101.21]).  
Study -103 
A significant higher percentage of patients achieved the primary endpoint in the tenofovir DF group 
compared  to  the  adefovir  dipivoxil  group.  This  superiority  of  tenofovir  was  mainly  driven  by  the 
higher virological response (HBV DNA <400 copies/ml), with a difference estimate between arms of 
65.9%.  
The mean reduction from baseline in plasma HBV DNA at week 48 was significantly greater in the 
tenofovir  group  (−6.17  log10  copies/ml)  than  in  the  adefovir  group  (−3.93  log10  copies/ml) 
(p < 0.001). The observed mean change in the tenofovir DF group was limited by the LLQ (lower limit 
of  quantification)  of  the  assay,  since  the  majority  of  subjects  in  that  group  reached  the  LLQ. 
Borderline significant superiority in terms of normalised ALT was also demonstrated. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  HBV  DNA  <  400  copies/ml  over  time  showed  that  virological 
response was rapidly achieved in the tenofovir DF group, where more than 50% of patients had HBV 
DNA < 400 copies/ml after 24 weeks of treatment.  
Although few patients achieved HBsAg loss (n= 5), a statistically significant difference in number of 
patients who achieved HBsAg loss is reported in the tenofovir DF group. Two subjects in the tenofovir 
Page 11 of 22 
 
 
 
DF treatment group had achieved HBsAg seroconversion (defined as HBsAg loss and positive result 
for anti-HBs) at week 48.  
In  line  with  the  virological  response,  a  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  in  terms  of 
biochemical response in the tenofovir DF group as compared to the ADV group.   
However,  the  high  difference  in  terms  of  virologic  response  was  not  associated  with  any  statistical 
difference in terms of histological response, with most of the patients having no change in the fibrosis 
score. The magnitude of the treatment difference in terms of histological response is around 10% of 
that  in  terms  of  virologic  response.  Nevertheless,  the  histological  response  is  expected  to  take  more 
time  to  develop  and  48  weeks  might  not  be  sufficient  to  observe  any  translation  of  the  virological 
suppression on the progression of the disease. 
The  MAH  was  requested  to  present  combining  virological,  histological  and  biochemical  results 
reported with and without adjustment for base stratification variables. An adjusted analysis as regards 
the  protocol  defined  primary  endpoint  was  also  requested.  ALT  change  [from]  baseline  data  using 
baseline  ALT  level  as  covariate  was  also  needed.  A  secondary  analysis  using  a  combined  endpoint 
was  performed.  Consistent  with  the  protocol-specified,  composite,  primary  endpoint,  tenofovir  DF 
was  superior  to  adefovir  dipivoxil  (p < 0.001)  for  the  triple  combined  endpoint.  Results  for  both 
studies  were  similar  regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  statistical  analyses  were  adjusted  for  baseline 
ALT. However, the CHMP request was only partially addressed. The combined endpoint for HBeAg+ 
patients  (study  -103)  did  not  include  HBeAg  loss.  Given  that  no  statistically  significant  difference 
between tenofovir DF and ADV was achieved on HBeAg loss, the superiority of tenofovir DF might 
have been lost on this combined endpoint.  
In  addition,  the  CHMP  requested  an  analysis  with  and  without  adjustment  for  base  stratification 
variables which was not provided. ALT change from baseline using baseline ALT level as covariate 
was not provided for study-103. 
Given  the  reliability  of  the  efficacy  demonstration  on  the  HBV  DNA  driven  primary  endpoint,  the 
CHMP agreed that the remaining points could be addressed in a post approval follow-up measure. 
The  viral  response  data  (as  plots  of  viral  load  over  time)  reported  separately  for  patients  with  and 
without  HBeAg  seroconversion  at  week  48,  showed  that  for  the  subgroup  of  seroconverters  in  both 
tenofovir  DF (n = 36)  and  adefovir  dipivoxil (n = 16)  groups,  mean  HBV  DNA  at  the  time  of 
seroconversion  was  2.51 log10  copies/ml  and  3.68  log10  copies/ml,  respectively.  Twenty-four  weeks 
after  seroconversion,  the  mean change  in  HBV  DNA  (log10 copies/ml)  was  −0.27  and  −0.69  for 
tenofovir DF-treated subjects (n = 19) and adefovir dipivoxil-treated subjects (n = 7), respectively.  
Overall, seroconverters had a more pronounced decrease in HBV DNA during the first 24 weeks of 
treatment, however no major difference in mean change in HBV DNA was observed in tenofovir DF-
treated patients with vs without seroconversion. The MAH did not provide the evolution of HBV DNA 
after  conversion,  precluding  further  discussion  on  the  durability  of  seroconversion.  This  will  be 
address by the MAH as a post-approval follow-up measure. 
The  per  protocol  analysis  result  requested  by  the  CHMP  for  both  studies  were  consistent  with  the 
results from the ITT analysis, providing further confidence in the superiority of TDF over ADV on the 
primary endpoint and viral suppression in the pivotal studies.  
Resistance analysis 
Study -102  
Genotypic testing was performed in all 50 viremic subjects (13.3% of the total RAT population) as a 
component of the year 1 resistance surveillance. After 48 weeks of treatment with tenofovir DF, 4/250 
(1.6%) subjects had active viral replication (HBV DNA levels > 400 copies/ml) without experiencing 
viral rebound during the study. Four of 250 (1.6%) subjects had experienced viral rebound. No subject 
in the tenofovir DF group discontinued after week 24 with active viral replication. No subject in the 
tenofovir DF group had conserved site change at week 48.  
At  baseline  two  individuals  in  the  tenofovir  group  harboured  virus  with  lamivudine  resistance 
mutations.  Both  achieved  full  suppression  (<LOQ).  At  baseline  one  subject  in  the  adefovir  group 
harboured virus with lamivudine resistance mutations and also achieved full suppression (<LOQ). 
Page 12 of 22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No  conserved  site  mutations  were  detected  in  association  with  tenofovir  DF  therapy  for  48  weeks. 
However,  at  this  stage  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  mutations  in  polymorphic  sites  may  be  associated 
with reduced sensitivity. It is expected that this issue will be addressed in patients with rebound viral 
failure in the ongoing resistance follow-up. 
Study -103 
Genotypic testing was performed in all 106 viremic subjects (39.8% of the total RAT population 13) 
as a component of the year 1 resistance surveillance. After 48 weeks of treatment with tenofovir DF 
24/176  (13.6%)  subjects  had  active  viral  replication  (HBV  DNA  levels  ≥  400  copies/ml)  without 
experiencing viral rebound during the study. Six of 176 (3.4%) had viral rebound1, and 1 additional 
subject  discontinued  after  week  24  with  active  viral  replication  (6.1-log10  decrease  from  baseline  in 
HBV  DNA  at  time  of  discontinuation).  Two  subjects  in  the  tenofovir  DF  group  had  conserved  site 
changes at week 48 with decreases in HBV DNA levels ranging from 5.3 to 6.6 log10 copies/ml. These 
conserved-site changes occurred at the following loci: rtS74 and rtH156.  The clinical significance of 
these  changes  is  currently  unknown.  The  fact  that  certain  mutations  in  polymorphic  sites  may  be 
associated with reduced sensitivity cannot be excluded. 
Overall, 426 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive subjects were evaluated for genotypic changes in 
HBV  polymerase  and  no  nucleoside-naïve  or  nucleoside-experienced  subject 
treated  with 
tenofovir DF for 48 weeks developed mutations associated with tenofovir DF resistance. 
The activity of tenofovir in case of lamivudine resistance has been documented in in vitro studies and 
in some literature data. Given the limited in vitro cross resistance, the MAH will conduct a phase IIIb 
study in lamivudine-resistant subjects for which the protocol synopsis will be submitted to the CHMP 
as a post-approval follow-up measure.  
Resistance  will  be  monitored  quarterly  in  all  patients  without  viral  suppression  in  the  HBV  pivotal 
studies. Quarterly results should be reported yearly with PSURs submission or upon CHMP request. 
Results of sub group analyses 
Integrated  subgroup  analyses  were  performed.  For  each  treatment  group  the  effect  of  several 
demographic  (age,  gender  and  race)  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  (HBV  DNA,  ALT,  Knodell 
necroinflammatory  and  fibrosis  scores,  genotype  [A−D],  prior  lamivudine/emtricitabine  experience) 
on  complete  response  and  its  components  (HBV  DNA  response  and  histological  response)  were 
assessed. Age subgroups were examined within each rather than across each of the two studies due to 
the known age difference between HBeAg+ and HBeAg− subjects.  
The  histological  results  reported  in  the  sub-group  of  patients  having  cirrhosis  at  baseline  (81  in  the 
tenofovir group and 42 in adefovir group) were similar to those reported in each treatment group in the 
whole chronic HBV population. No advantage of tenofovir DF over adefovir dipivoxil was seen in this 
subgroup of patients. 
A marginal influence of baseline HBV DNA level on complete response and the proportion of subjects 
with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 48 was observed. This finding was more pronounced within 
the  adefovir  dipivoxil-treated  subjects,  leading  to  an  overall  larger  difference  between  treatment 
groups in favour of tenofovir DF in the subjects with baseline viral load above the median across the 
two studies.  
In both studies, the percentage of tenofovir DF treated subjects achieving complete response (73% and 
69%)  and  HBV  DNA  below  400  copies/ml  (90%  and  88%)  were  similar  in  treatment-experienced 
subjects (n = 51) and treatment-naïve subjects (n = 375), respectively.

Analysis of potential predictors of response for the tenofovir DF-treated subjects using the endpoint of 
HBV DNA < 400 copies/m at week 48 were performed using pooled data from the two pivotal studies. 
Baseline HBV DNA (≤ 9 log10 copies/ml vs. > 9 log10 copies/ml) (p < 0.0001) and baseline body mass 
index  (BMI)  (< 30  vs.  ≥ 30)  (p = 0.0052)  were  the  two  identified  baseline  factors  significantly 
associated with virologic response. However, considering the under-exposure of patients with BMI ≥ 
30 kg/m2, the MAH will comment on the possibility to recommend a higher dose in patients with BMI 
≥ 30 kg/m2. This will be address as a post-approval follow-up measure. 
Moreover,  results  showed  response  at  24-week  as  a  strong  positive  predictive  value  on  treatment 
response at week 48 in both populations. However, given the poor negative predictive value of the 24-
week results on treatment response at week 48 in HBeAg positive and negative patients, this cannot be 
used to support therapeutic decision. The analysis of the predictive value of the 24-week response on 
treatment-emergent resistance will have to be assessed when long-term data are available. In addition 
the MAH will assess predictive factors of seroconversion.  
Supportive studies 
Twenty-four  week  interim  data  from  a  phase  II,  randomised,  double-blind  study  GS-US-174-106 
exploring  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  tenofovir  monotherapy  vs  emtricitabine/tenofovir  DF  fixed-
combination in the treatment of HBeAg+ and HBeAg- chronic HB infected patients being treated with 
adefovir dipivoxil and having persistent viral replication was submitted.  
The  majority  of  subjects  were  male  (76%),  mean  age  39  years  and  mean  baseline  HBV  DNA  5.97 
log10 copies/ml. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma  HBV  DNA levels 
< 169 copies/ml  (LLQ)  at  week  48.  A  total  of  105  patients  were  randomised  and  treated  and 
60 individuals  were  evaluated  for  efficacy  at  week  24:  46/60  (76.7%)  subjects  showed  HBV  DNA 
<400 copies/ml and 37/60 (61.7%) had plasma HBV DNA level <LLQ (169 copies/ml).  
Clinical studies in special populations 
A  prospective  “Adult  AIDS  Clinical  Trials  Group”  study–  ACTG  study  A5127  –  performed  in 
HIV/HBV co-infected patients was provided. This was a randomised, 48 week double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial of 10 mg daily of adefovir dipivoxil vs 300 mg of tenofovir DF in patients with HBV 
and HIV co-infection on stable ART, with serum HBV DNA > 100,000 copies/ml, and plasma HIV-1 
RNA < 10,000 copies/ml.  The study was closed early as interim results showed that the primary non 
inferiority end point had been achieved without safety issues.  
Fifty-two  subjects  were  randomised.  At  baseline,  73%  of  subjects  had  a  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  
< 50 copies/ml, 86% were HBeAg+, 94% were lamivudine resistant, median serum ALT was 52 IU/l, 
and  98%  had  compensated  liver  disease.  The  mean  time-weighted  average  change  in  serum  HBV 
DNA from baseline to week 48 was -4.44 log10 copies/ml for tenofovir DF and -3.21 log10 copies/ml 
for adefovir. 
No  difference  in  terms  of  toxicity  between  the  2  treatment  groups  was  observed.  Eleven  
patients  (5  adefovir  group  and  6  tenofovir  DF  group)  experienced  elevations  of  serum  ALT  on 
treatment but none accompanied with signs of hepatic decompensation. Over 48 weeks, treatment with 
either adefovir or tenofovir DF resulted in clinically important suppression of serum HBV DNA.  
Clinical safety 
The safety assessment was based on the data from the main pivotal studies (GS-174-102 and GS-174-
103).  Additional  safety  data  was  provided  from  blinded  phase  of  study  GS-US-174-108,  comparing 
tenofovir  DF,  emtricitabine/tenofovir  DF,  and  entecavir  in  the  treatment  of  chronic  hepatitis  B  in 
subjects with decompensated liver disease.  
Patient exposure 
In the two pivotal studies, a total of 603 subjects (94%, 399/426 in the tenofovir DF group and 95%, 
204/215 in the adefovir group) completed 48 weeks of double-blind treatment. The mean duration of 
exposure was similar between treatment groups (328.9 in the tenofovir DF group and 327.4 in adefovir 
group).  Long-term  data  (exposure  more  than  one year)  for  tenofovir  DF  in  the  treatment  of  patients 
with chronic hepatitis B is currently not available. The 96 week and the final 240 week report for the 
Page 14 of 22 
 
 
 
 
 
two  pivotal  studies  will  be  provided  to  substantiate  the  long  term  safety  of  tenofovir  in  chronic  HB 
patients. 
Cumulative worldwide exposure to tenofovir DF (mainly in HIV-1 indication) since 26 October 2001 
to 31 May 2007 is estimated to be 1,364,784 patients-years of treatment.

The more commonly reported adverse events in the tenofovir DF group irrespective of causality were 
gastro-intestinal disorders. Abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea were reported at a higher frequency 
in tenofovir DF treatment compared to treatment with adefovir. This is in line with the current safety 
profile of tenofovir DF in HIV-1 infected patients. 
The  higher  frequency  of  nausea  in  the  overall  tenofovir  DF  group  was  mainly  due  to  the  greater 
frequency of this adverse event reported in in HBeAg+ patients (13.6% in tenofovir DF group vs 1.1% 
in  adefovir  group)  compared  to  HBeAg-  patients  (6.4%  in  tenofovir  DF  group  vs  4.0%  in  adefovir 
group).  The  large  difference  observed  in  the  reporting  of  nausea  between  tenofovir  group  in  each 
studies is unclear. 
Serious adverse events (SAE) and Death 
No deaths were reported in the two pivotal studies -102 and -103. However, 3 subjects died during the 
course of study -108, in subjects with decompensated liver disease. None were considered related to 
study  medication.  The  data  are  still  blinded  for  study  -108  therefore  this  will  be  further  discussed 
when the final report for this study is provided. 
Treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  events  occurred  at  similar  frequencies  in  both  treatment  groups 
(6.3%  tenofovir  DF  and  6.5%  adefovir  dipivoxil).  The  most  frequently  SAE  reported  was  ALT 
increased, reported in 9 patients (2.1%) treated with tenofovir DF and in 4 patients (1.9%) treated with 
adefovir dipivoxil. Increased in ALT in 5 (1.2%) of the 9 patients was considered related to tenofovir 
DF  treatment.  Other  SAEs  reported  in  more  than  1  subject  was  AST  increased  in  4  subjects  (3  on 
tenofovir  DF  and  1  on  adefovir  dipivoxil)  with  1  considered  related  to  tenofovir  treatment. 
Thrombocytopenia,  and  hepatitis  B  (ALT  flare)  were  also  reported  as  SAE  related  to  tenofovir 
treatment (1 subject each). 
Hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  and  hepatitis  B  were  reported  in  three  patients  on  tenofovir  DF 
treatment, compared to none on adefovir. Further information provided is not sufficient to determine 
the causality to tenofovir DF. HCC will be specifically monitored in future PSURs and in any ongoing 
or planned clinical studies.  
Adverse events of interest 
Liver toxicity  
(cid:190)  ALT flares  
In  the  pivotal  studies,  a  slight  trend  towards  a  higher  proportion  of  on-treatment  ALT  flares2  was 
observed in tenofovir DF treated patients (2.6%, n=11) compared to adefovir-treated (1.9%, n=4).  
Most of ALT flares occurred in patients with HBeAg+ chronic hepatitis B (8/11 tenofovir DF-treated 
and  3/4  adefovir  –treated).  Among  the  8  in  the  tenofovir  DF  group,  5  had  a  seroconversion  to  anti-
HBe at week 24 or 36. Among the 3 in the adefovir group, 1 seroconverted to anti-HBe at week 8. The 
majority  of  ALT  flares  occurred  in  patients  with  baseline  ALT  >  2N  or  with  baseline  HBV  DNA  
> 7.88 log10 copies/ml. No patients with ALT flares had signs of hepatic decompensation.  
2 Defined by: elevation of ALT > 2 × baseline and > 10 × ULN with or without associated symptoms or, 
abnormal  laboratory  parameters  suggestive  of  worsening  hepatic  function  (abnormal  bilirubin  ≥  2  mg/dl  above  baseline, 
abnormal PT ≥ 2 sec above baseline, international normalised ratio (INR) ≥ 0.5 over baseline, abnormal albumin ≥ 1 g/dl 
decrease from baseline, or elevated serum lactate levels >2 × ULN) along with any ALT elevation (i.e., 1-grade shift or 2 × 
previous value). 
Page 16 of 22 
  
  
  
 
 
                                                      
 
In  the  tenofovir  DF,  all  except  one  patient  experienced  ALT  flares  during  the  first  two  months  of 
study. All patients responded to tenofovir DF treatment and had concomitant decreases in HBV DNA.  
Overall, on-treatment ALT flares reported in tenofovir DF-treated patients seemed more likely related 
to  immunologically-mediated  inflammatory  response  associated  with  viral  clearance  since  all  had  a 
reduction from baseline in HBV DNA that coincided with the ALT flare. 
A  warning  on  the  risk  of  exacerbations  of  hepatitis  in  some  patients  with  serum  HBV  DNA  levels 
decrease  and  on  the  higher  occurrence  observed  in  HBeAg+  chronic  HB  patients  was  added  to  the 
SPC.  
Study  drug  discontinuation  with  treatment-free  follow-up  was  contraindicated  for  subjects  with 
bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis due to the potential risk of exacerbation of hepatitis. 
As of 25 January 2008, post-treatment exacerbation developed in 3 patients in study -102 and in no 
patient  in  study  -103.    Lesser  ALT  elevations  were  observed  in  3  additional  patients  (1  from  study  
-102  and  2  from  study  -103)  who  had  grade 3  ALT  levels  ≥ 2  months  following  study  drug 
discontinuation with no other liver function test abnormalities coincident with grade 3 ALT elevation. 
Of the 3 subjects with post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis B, 1 with cirrhosis who discontinued 
study  -102,  developed  flare  with  concomitant  grade  3  bilirubin  (3.7  mg/dl).  Commercial  anti-HBV 
treatment  (entecavir)  was  started  within  2  days  of  flare  onset  with  resolution  of  the  exacerbation 
episode. 
Data  on  post-treatment  exacerbation  of  hepatitis  B  following  discontinuation  of  tenofovir  DF  is 
currently  limited  due  to  the  small  sample  size  and  incomplete  (currently  ongoing)  follow-up.  Post-
treatment flare is a known consequence of withdrawal of oral nucleoside or nucleotide treatment.  
In case of treatment discontinuation, hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical 
and  laboratory  follow-up  for  at  least  several  months.  Warnings  on  post-treatment  hepatic  flare  are 
included in the SPC. 
A  specific  section  pertaining  to  all  cases  of  on-treatment  and  post-treatment  ALT  flares  reported  in 
chronic HB patients should be presented and discussed in each future PSUR for tenofovir DF. 
(cid:190) Hepatic events  
Hepatitis and increased liver enzymes (most commonly AST, ALT, and gamma-glutamyl transferase) 
have been identified as potential adverse drug reactions from postmarketing HIV experience. 
Fourteen  patients  (3.3%)  treated  with  tenofovir  DF for  chronic HBV  and  13  subjects  (6.0%)  treated 
with  adefovir  dipivoxil  experienced  treatment-emergent  hepatobiliary  disorders  by  week  48.  Only  2 
were  considered  to  be  related  to  tenofovir  DF  and  one  related  to  adefovir  dipivoxil.  All  cases  of 
hepatic events will be closely monitored.  
Renal toxicity 
The number of patients with renal impairment studied in tenofovir DF clinical trials is very low. The 
clinical  studies  performed  in  patients  with  HBV  excluded  patients  with  creatinine  clearance  
<70  ml/min.  Therefore,  the  patient  population  possibly  more  prone  to  experience  safety  problems 
(renal and possibly bone) with tenofovir DF, has not been studied. 
Renal/urinary  adverse  events  considered  treatment-related  were  seen  in  7/426  patients  (1.6%)  on 
tenofovir  DF  and  in  7/215  patients  (3.3%)  on  adefovir  dipivoxil.  Overall  the  percentage  of  patients 
with renal and urinary adverse events was 6.5% tenofovir DF vs 5.1% adefovir dipivoxil. Confirmed 
decreased  in serum  phosphorus  <  2mg/dl  was  reported  in  1.4%  of  patients  on tenofovir  DF  vs  none 
adefovir group. One case of drug-related hypophosphatemia was reported in the tenofovir DF group. 
No  renal  event  or

laboratory  abnormality  resulted 
in  dose  modification, 
The MAH provided a summary report regarding renal and bone safety in all patients (HIV and HBV) 
with renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min), who were long-term exposed to tenofovir in 
clinical studies by CHMP request.  
Data  from  the  pivotal  HBV  studies  showed  that  none  of  the  25  tenofovir  DF-treated  patients  with 
creatinine  clearance  <  80ml/min  at  baseline  had  experienced  significant  alteration  in  renal  function. 
Data available from other studies (GS-US-174-106 and GS-US-174-108) are limited and the treatment 
Page 17 of 22 
 
 
 
 
remains blinded. Data from HIV development program regarding subjects with mild renal impairment 
(creatinine  clearance  >  50ml/min  to  <80ml/min)  from  HIV  studies  is  very  limited  (GS-99-903,  GS-
US-934 (n=28) and GS-104-235 (n=5)).  
From  the  clinical  experience  of  tenofovir  in  the  treatment  of  HIV  infection,  it  is  clear  that  the  renal 
safety of tenofovir is compromised in  patients with  moderate renal dysfunction or with concomitant 
therapy  including  medicinal  products  that  (moderately)  lower  tenofovir  clearance.  Hence,  for  the 
present dosage 300 mg QD, patients with a clearance of ~50-70 ml/min will be studied separately with 
focus  on  renal  (tubular)  as  well  as  bone  safety.  The  MAH  will  conduct  a  phase  3b  study  in 
lamivudine-resistant patients. This patient population will include patients with mild renal impairment 
(with a lower threshold for creatinine clearance of 50 ml/min). A protocol synopsis will be provided to 
the CHMP within 3 months of approval of the indication of hepatitis B.  
The renal monitoring should be focused on parameters related to tubular damage (serum phosphorus, 
urine-albumin,  urine-β2  microglobuline)  rather  than  renal  function  as  measured  by  creatinine 
clearance.  As  retrospective  dosages  of  urine-β2-microglobulin  and  bone-specific  ALP  from  stored 
samples are not feasible, the MAH will conduct DEXA scans of the spine and hip at regular intervals 
(every 6 to 12 months) through week72- 240 for patients in studies GS-US-174-102 and -103. 
The  CHMP  agreed  not  to  absolute  contraindicate  tenofovir  DF  in  severe  renal  impairment  patients. 
Rather  a  strong  warning  stressing  that  tenofovir  DF  should  only  be  used  in  patients  with 
moderate/severe renal impairment if the potential benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the 
potential risks was included in the SPC. Consequently the wording on dosing regimens was restricted 
accordingly. 
Bone toxicity 
In  the  pivotal  studies  in  HBV,  bone  toxicity  was  monitored  by  phosphorus  levels  in  serum  and  by 
reported  fractures.  Other  serum  bone  markers  were  not  reported  and  DEXA  scanning  was  not 
undertaken. This issue was more intensely studied in the treatment of HIV-infection. 
Tenofovir does not appear to be bone toxic per se. However, as tenofovir will be given to patients with 
chronic  hepatitis  B  for  long  time  periods,  including  women  (with  higher  background  incidence  of 
osteoporosis), the renal function of these patients will eventually decrease, as part of aging process and 
this way increasing the group of patients which might be more prone to tenofovir toxicity.  
Renal – and bone – toxicity is better studied in HBV patients than in HIV patients. In the former group 
tenofovir DF is given as a single agent, and co-morbidities and other complicating factors are likely to 
be  more  common  in  HIV  patients.  Hence,  the  MAH  will  include  DEXA  scanning  as  part  of  the 
requested safety study in patients with moderate renal dysfunction.   
Gastro-intestinal toxicity 
The  most  commonly  gastro-intestinal  disorders  in  tenofovir  DF-treated  patients  are  nausea  and 
vomiting. A slightly higher incidence of mild nausea (20%) was observed among tenofovir DF-treated 
subjects  compared  with  control  subjects  (15%)  in  a  pooled  analysis.  Similar  trend  was  observed  in 
tenofovir DF clinical program in patients with chronic hepatitis B. 
Nausea  was  more  frequent  among  females  treated  with  tenofovir  DF  (23.7%)  than  among  females 
treated with adefovir (7.4%). In males, the incidence of nausea was slightly higher in tenofovir DF but 
the difference was less pronounced than in female patients.  
Overall,  female  patients  on  tenofovir  DF  experienced  more  gastro-intestinal  disorders  than  female 
patients on adefovir and with a higher rate compared to male patients. Similar differences are observed 
for most gastro-intestinal disorders, fatigue and dizziness. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
No major difference was observed between both treatment groups. The proportion of patients having 
discontinued  study  treatment  was  similar  in  tenofovir  DF-treated  patients  and  adefovir–treated 
patients.  
Dose  modifications  and  interruptions  were  also  reported  in  a  similar  number  of  patients  in  each 
treatment  group  (0.9%  for  both  adefovir  and  tenofovir  DF).  In  tenofovir  DF  group,  the  reasons  for 
interruption or dose modification included nausea, vomiting and headache in one subject and cervical 
haemorrhage, head injury and increased creatinine phosphokinase in one subject each.

Special populations 
Safety  data  of  tenofovir  DF  used  in  HIV/HBV  co-infected  subjects  are  available  from  study  ACTG 
A5127;  from  small  subsets  of  co-infected  subjects  who  participated  in  clinical  studies  in  HIV-1 
infection  (studies  GS-99-903,  GS-01-934,  GS-99-907  and  GS-98-902)  and  from  investigators-led 
studies on HIV/HBV co-infected subjects. 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  tenofovir  DF  in  subjects  with  HIV/HBV  co-infection  did  not  seem  to 
differ  from  that  in  subjects  with  HBV  mono-infection.  However,  due  to  the  risk  of  development  of 
HIV  resistance,  tenofovir  should  only  be  used  as  part  of  an  appropriate  antiretroviral  combination 
regimen in HIV/HBV infected patients.  
No data are available for the use of tenofovir DF in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Special 
attention should be paid to the off label use of TDF in this specific population of patients since they 
are  at  higher  risk  of  having  underlying  renal  insufficiency  (the  authorisation  did  not  include  liver 
transplant  patients).  Moreover,  the  potential  for  an  increased  risk  when  tenofovir  is  combined  with 
other nephrotoxic medicinal products must be taken into account. 
Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted a revised risk management plan (RMP), which covered the approved indication 
in  HIV-1  infected  patients  and  the  applied  indication  in  the  treatment  of  chronic  HBV  infected 
patients. 
Furthermore the MAH will distribute a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) to all 
new

provided for CHMP agreement on the final wording at the April 2008 plenary meeting.

In addition to the above identified safety concerns and activities, the MAH will include black patients 
as important missing information in the next update of the RMP. Comparing HBV-infected patients to 
HIV-infected patients in clinical studies, there were more Asian (32.3% vs 0.7%) and less black (5%
Page 21 of 22 
 
 
 
 
 
vs  16.4%)  in  HBV-infected  patients  treated  with  tenofovir  DF.  The  information  in  this  population 
(only 39 HBV-infected black patients treated with tenofovir DF) is therefore limited. 
Overall conclusion and Benefit-Risk assessment 
The data provided showed superiority of tenofovir DF over adefovir dipivoxil in term of proportion of 
patients  with  a  complete  response  (defined  as  HBV  DNA  <  400  copies/ml  and  histological 
improvement indicated by at least a 2-point in Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in 
Knodell fibrosis score) at week 48 in both populations of Hbe Ag positive and negative patients.  
The  superiority  of  tenofovir  DF  was  mainly  driven  by  the  virological  response.  No  significant 
difference was seen in terms of histological and serological responses.  
No mutations demonstrated to be associated with viral failure have been detected for tenofovir DF in 
the  submitted  studies  at  week  48.  Resistance  will  be  monitored  every  quarterly  and  results  will  be 
reported yearly. 
As  for  the  HIV  infected  patients  the  prominent  aspects  of  tenofovir  DF  safety  profile  remains.  The 
renal  safety  that  would  need  particular  monitoring  is  already  recommended.  A  strong  warning 
stressing that tenofovir DF should only be used in patients with chronic HB and moderate/severe renal 
impairment,  if  the  potential  benefits  of  treatment  outweigh  the  potential  risks,  was  included  in  the 
SPC.  Additional  data  in  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment  and  chronic  HBV 
infection,  including  safety  data  and  steady-state  pharmacokinetics  will  be  provided. In  addition,  a 
study  including  participants  with  mild  renal  impairment  and  lamivudine-resistant  HBV  will  be 
conducted.  A  Direct  Healthcare  Professional  Communication  (DHPC)  will  be  send  to  all  concerned 
Health Care professionals in order to adequately inform them of the risk of renal toxicity associated 
with tenofovir and the existence of specific recommendations to manage the renal toxicity.  
Regarding bone toxicity, periodic DEXA scanning will be performed ongoing HBV pivotal trials and 
in  the  planned  study  in  lamivudine  resistant  patients.  Warning  regarding  potential  ALT  flares,  on-
treatment  and  post-treatment  exacerbations  of  hepatitis,  are  reflected  in  the  product  information  and 
will be periodically monitored.  
Long term efficacy and safety data will be provided from ongoing and planned studies as committed 
by the MAH.  
In conclusion, the benefit/risk balance for tenofovir DF in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults 
with compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis 
is positive. 
Conclusion 
On  19  March  2008  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet.

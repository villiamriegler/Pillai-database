CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Therapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will 
regularly monitor the intake of the medicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made 
according to current guidelines. The tolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a 
regular basis, preferably within three months after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of 
memantine and the patient's tolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to 
current clinical guidelines. Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit 
is favourable and the patient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine 
should be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does 
not tolerate treatment. 
Adults 
Dose titration 
The maximum daily dose is 20 mg per day. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable effects the 
maintenance dose is achieved by upward titration of 5 mg per week over the first 3 weeks as follows: 
Week 1 (day 1-7): 
The patient should take half a 10 mg film-coated tablet (5 mg) per day for 7 days. 
Week 2 (day 8-14): 
The patient should take one 10 mg film-coated tablet (10 mg) per day for 7 days. 
Week 3 (day 15-21): 
The patient should take one and a half 10 mg film-coated tablet (15 mg) per day for 7 days. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
From Week 4 on: 
The patient should take two 10 mg film-coated tablets (20 mg) per day. 
Maintenance dose 
The recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day. 
Elderly  
On the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is 
20 mg per day (two 10 mg tablets once a day) as described above. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min) no dose 
adjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
30-49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, 
the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5-29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. 
Hepatic impairment  
In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B) no dose 
adjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are 
available. Administration of Memantine Accord is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Children and adolescents 
Memantine Accord is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on 
safety and efficacy. 
Method of administration 
Memantine Accord should be administered once a day and should be taken at the same time every 
day.The film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Caution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with 
predisposing factors for epilepsy. 
Concomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or 
dextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as 
memantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be 
more frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5). 
Some factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 'Elimination') may necessitate careful 
monitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a 
vegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by 
states of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. 
In most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart 
failure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited 
data are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised.

Memantine Accord contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, 
the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactosemalabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following 
interactions may occur: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and 
anticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as 
memantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant 
administration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify 
their effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary. 
Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of 
pharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The 
same may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one 
published case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. 
Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and 
nicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly 
interact with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. 
There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when 
memantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. 
In post-marketing experience, isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases 
have been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal 
relationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for 
patients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants. 
In single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects, no relevant active substance-
active substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed. 
In a clinical study in young healthy subjects, no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics 
of galantamine was observed. 
Memantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, 
epoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For memantine, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies indicate a 
potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher 
than at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine 
should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the 
lipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
No adverse effects of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and 
compromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, memantine has minor to moderate 
influenceon the ability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take 
special care. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with memantine and 
1,595 patients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with memantine did 
not differ from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. 
The most frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the memantine group than 
in the placebo group were dizziness (6.3 % vs 5.6 %, respectively), headache (5.2 % vs 3.9 %), 
constipation (4.6 % vs 2.6 %), somnolence (3.4 % vs 2.2 %) and hypertension (4.1 % vs 2.8 %). 
The following adverse reactions listed in the table below have been accumulated in clinical studies 
with memantine and since its introduction in the market. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable 
effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alzheimer's disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-
marketing experience these events have been reported in patients treated with memantine. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Only limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing 
experience. 
Symptoms 
Relative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with 
either only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases 
below 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system 
(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) 
and/or of gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). 
In the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2,000 mg 
memantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and 
agitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered 
without permanent sequelae. 
In another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received 
400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as 
restlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and 
unconsciousness. 
Treatment 
In the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or 
overdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric 
lavage, carbomedicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, 
forced diuresis should be used as appropriate. 
In case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful 
symptomatic clinical treatment should be considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. 
There is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at 
NMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in 
neurodegenerative dementia. 
Memantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It 
modulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal 
dysfunction.

Clinical studies 
A pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe 
Alzheimer's disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3-14) included 
a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in comparison 
to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician´s interview based impression of 
change (CIBIC-plus): p = 0.025; Alzheimer´s disease cooperative study – activities of daily living 
(ADCS-ADLsev): p = 0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p = 0.002). 
A pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease 
(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10-22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed a 
statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: 
Alzheimer´s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p = 0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p = 0.004) at week 24 
last observation carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate 
Alzheimer's disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. 
In the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary 
efficacy endpoint at week 24. 
A meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (MMSE total scores < 20) 
from the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies 
with patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically 
significant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. 
When patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a 
statistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated 
7 patients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21 % vs. 11 %, 
p < 0.0001). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Memantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100 %. tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. 
There is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. 
Distribution  
Daily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 
70-150 ng/ml (0.5-1μmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5-30 mg were 
administered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of 
distribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45 % of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. 
Biotransformation  
In man, about 80 % of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. 
Main human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4-and 6-hydroxy-
memantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit 
NMDA-antagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. 
In a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84 % of the dose was recovered within 
20 days, more than 99 % being excreted renally. 
Elimination  
Memantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½ of 60-100hours. In 
volunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m² and part 
of total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The 
renal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7-9 
(see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to 
a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. 
Linearity 
Studies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10-40 mg. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
At a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) 
of memantine, which is 0.5 μmol in human frontal cortex. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal 
vacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum 
concentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the 
effects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical 
relevance of these findings is unknown. 
Ocular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but 
not in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not 
disclose any ocular changes. 
Phospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was 
observed in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic 
properties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed 
in lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these 
findings is unknown. 
No genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no 
evidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in 
rats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on 
fertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly 
higher than at human exposure.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following 
interactions may occur: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and 
anticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as 
memantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant 
administration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify 
their effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary. 
Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of 
pharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The 
same may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one 
published case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. 
Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and 
nicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly 
interact with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. 
There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when 
memantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. 
In post-marketing experience, isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases 
have been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal 
relationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for 
patients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants. 
In single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects, no relevant active substance-
active substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed. 
In a clinical study in young healthy subjects, no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics 
of galantamine was observed. 
Memantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, 
epoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For memantine, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies indicate a 
potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher 
than at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine 
should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the 
lipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
No adverse effects of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and 
compromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, memantine has minor to moderate influence 
on the ability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with memantine and 
1,595 patients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with memantine did 
not differ from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. 
The most frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the memantine group than 
in the placebo group were dizziness (6.3 % vs 5.6 %, respectively), headache (5.2 % vs 3.9 %), 
constipation (4.6 % vs 2.6 %), somnolence (3.4 % vs 2.2 %) and hypertension (4.1 % vs 2.8 %). 
The following adverse reactions listed in the table below have been accumulated in clinical studies 
with memantine and since its introduction in the market. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable 
effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Alzheimer's disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In 
post-marketing experience these events have been reported in patients treated with memantine.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Only limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing 
experience. 
Symptoms 
Relative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with 
either only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases 
below 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system 
(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) 
and/or of gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). 
In the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2,000 mg 
memantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and 
agitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered 
without permanent sequelae. 
In another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received 
400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as 
restlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and 
unconsciousness. 
Treatment  
In the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or 
overdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric 
lavage, carbomedicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, 
forced diuresis should be used as appropriate. 
In case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful 
symptomatic clinical treatment should be considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. 
There is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at 
NMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in 
neurodegenerative dementia. 
Memantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It 
modulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal 
dysfunction. 
Clinical studies 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe 
Alzheimer's disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3-14) included 
a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in comparison 
to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician´s interview based impression of 
change (CIBIC-plus): p = 0.025; Alzheimer´s disease cooperative study – activities of daily living 
(ADCS-ADLsev): p = 0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p = 0.002). 
A pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease 
(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10-22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed a 
statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: 
Alzheimer´s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p = 0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p = 0.004) at week 24 
last observation carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate 
Alzheimer's disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. 
In the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the 
primaryefficacy endpoint at week 24. 
A meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (MMSE total scores < 20) 
from the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies 
with patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically 
significant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. 
When patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a 
statistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated 
7 patients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21 % vs. 11 %, 
p < 0.0001). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Memantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100 %. tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. 
There is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. 
Distribution  
Daily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 
70-150 ng/ml (0.5-1μmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5-30 mg were 
administered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of 
distribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45 % of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. 
Biotransformation: 
In man, about 80 % of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. 
Main human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4-and 6-hydroxy-
memantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit 
NMDA-antagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. 
In a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84 % of the dose was recovered within 
20days, more than 99 % being excreted renally. 
Elimination 
Memantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½ of 60-100hours. In 
volunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m² and part 
of total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The 
renal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7-9 
(see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to 
a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. 
Linearity 
Studies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10-40 mg. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  
At a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) 
of memantine, which is 0.5 μmol in human frontal cortex. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal 
vacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum 
concentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the 
effects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical 
relevance of these findings is unknown. 
Ocular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but 
not in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not 
disclose any ocular changes. 
Phospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was 
observed in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic 
properties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed 
in lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these 
findings is unknown. 
No genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no 
evidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in 
rats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on 
fertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly 
higher than at human exposure.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Posology 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Therapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will 
regularly monitor the intake of the medicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made 
according to current guidelines. The tolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a 
regular basis, preferably within three months after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of 
memantine and the patient's tolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to 
current clinical guidelines. Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit 
is favourable and the patient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine 
should be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does 
not tolerate treatment. 
Adults 
Dose titration 
The recommended starting dose is 5 mg per day which is stepwise increased over the first 4 weeks of 
treatment reaching the recommended maintenance dose as follows: 
Week 1 (day 1-7): 
The patient should take one 5 mg film-coated tablet per day (white) for 7 days. 
Week 2 (day 8-14): 
The patient should take one 10 mg film-coated tablet per day (white, scored) for 7 days. 
Week 3 (day 15-21): 
The patient should take one 15 mg film-coated tablet per day (orange to grey-orange) for 7 days. 
Week 4 (day 22-28): 
The patient should take one 20 mg film-coated tablet per day (pale red to grey-red, scored) for 7 days. 
Maintenance dose 
The recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day. 
Elderly 
On the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is 
20 mg per day (20 mg tablets once a day) as described above. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min) no dose 
adjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
30-49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, 
the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5-29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B) no dose 
adjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are 
available. Administration of Memantine Accord is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Children and adolescents 
Memantine Accord is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on 
safety and efficacy. 
Method of administration 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Memantine Accord should be administered once a day and should be taken at the same time every day. 
The film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Caution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with 
predisposing factors for epilepsy. 
Concomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or 
dextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as 
memantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be 
more frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5). 
Some factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 'Elimination') may necessitate careful 
monitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a 
vegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by 
states of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. 
In most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart 
failure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited 
data are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised. 
Excipients 
Memantine Accord contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, 
the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactosemalabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following 
interactions may occur: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and 
anticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as 
memantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant 
administration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify 
their effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary. 
Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of 
pharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The 
same may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one 
published case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. 
Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and 
nicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly 
interact with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. 
There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when 
memantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. 
In post-marketing experience, isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases 
have been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal 
relationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for 
patients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants. 
In single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects, no relevant active substance-
active substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a clinical study in young healthy subjects, no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics 
of galantamine was observed. 
Memantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, 
epoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For memantine, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies indicate a 
potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher 
than at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine 
should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the 
lipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
No adverse effects of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and 
compromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, memantine has minor to moderate influence 
on the ability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile

4.9  Overdose 
Only limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing 
experience. 
Symptoms 
Relative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with 
either only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases 
below 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system 
(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) 
and/or of gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). 
In the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2,000 mg 
memantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and 
agitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered 
without permanent sequelae. 
In another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received 
400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as

Treatment 
In the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or 
overdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric 
lavage, carbomedicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, 
forced diuresis should be used as appropriate. 
In case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful 
symptomatic clinical treatment should be considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. 
There is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at 
 NMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression 
inneurodegenerative dementia. 
Memantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It 
modulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal 
dysfunction. 
Clinical studies 
A pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe 
Alzheimer's disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3-14) included 
a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in comparison 
to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician´s interview based impression of 
change (CIBIC-plus): p = 0.025; Alzheimer´s disease cooperative study – activities of daily living 
(ADCS-ADLsev): p = 0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p = 0.002). 
A pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease 
(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10-22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed a 
statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: 
Alzheimer´s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p = 0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p = 0.004) at week 24 
last observation carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate 
Alzheimer's disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. 
In the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary 
efficacy endpoint at week 24. 
A meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (MMSE total scores <20) 
from the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies 
with patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically 
significant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. 
When patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a 
statistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated 
7 patients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21 % vs. 11 %, 
p < 0.0001). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Memantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100 %. tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. 
There is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. 
Distribution 
Daily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 
70-150 ng/ml (0.5-1 μmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5-30 mg were 
administered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of 
distribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45 % of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. 
Biotransformation 
In man, about 80 % of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. 
Main human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4-and 6-hydroxy-
memantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit 
NMDA-antagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. 
In a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84 % of the dose was recovered within 
20 days, more than 99 % being excreted renally. 
Elimination 
Memantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½ of 60-100hours. In 
volunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m² and part 
of total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. 
Renal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The 
renal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7-9 
(see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to 
a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. 
Linearity 
Studies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10-40 mg. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
At a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) 
of memantine, which is 0.5 μmol in human frontal cortex. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal 
vacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum 
concentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the 
effects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical 
relevance of these findings is unknown. 
Ocular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but 
not in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not 
disclose any ocular changes. 
Phospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was 
observed in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic 
properties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed 
in lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these 
findings is unknown. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no 
evidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in 
rats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on 
fertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly 
higher than at human exposure.

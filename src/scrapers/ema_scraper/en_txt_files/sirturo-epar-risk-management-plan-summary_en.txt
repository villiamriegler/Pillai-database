PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of Risk Management Plan for SIRTURO (Bedaquiline)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  SIRTURO.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of SIRTURO, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about SIRTURO's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
SIRTURO's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  Package  Leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how SIRTURO should be used. 
This summary of the RMP  for SIRTURO should  be read in the context of  all this  information 
including the assessment  report of the evaluation and its  plain-language summary,  all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of
SIRTURO's RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What it is Used For
SIRTURO is  authorized  for  use  as  part  of  an  appropriate  combination  regimen  for  pulmonary 
multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) in adults and adolescent patients (12  years to less 
than 18  years of  age and weighing  at least 30 kg) when  an  effective treatment regimen cannot 
otherwise  be  composed  for  reasons  of  resistance  or  tolerability (see  SmPC  for  the  full 
indication). It contains bedaquiline as the active substance and it is given as oral tablets (100 mg 
of bedaquiline).
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  SIRTURO’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  SIRTURO’s 
EPAR,  including in its plain-language summary,  available on the European  Medicines Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/sirturo 
II.
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks
Important risks of SIRTURO, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about SIRTURO's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:



Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the  PL
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;

The  medicine’s  legal  status  — the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (eg, with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analyzed,  including  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (PSUR)  assessment, so  that 
immediate  action  can  be

II.A.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important  risks  of  SIRTURO  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  taken.  Important 
risks  can be regarded as  identified or  potential.  Identified risks  are concerns for which there is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  SIRTURO.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine);

Summary of Important Risks
Important Identified Risk: Electrocardiogram QT prolonged
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Risk factors and risk 
groups
In vitro data indicated that bedaquiline and N-monodesmethyl metabolite
(M2) have the potential to inhibit the human ether-à-go-go-related gene 
channel. In vivo, QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) prolongation was 
seen in a 6-month repeated-dose study in dogs given 40 mg/kg/day up to 
2 months and disappeared after lowering the dose to 20 mg/kg/day.
A direct relationship between bedaquiline or M2 plasma concentration and 
QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia (QTcF) 
prolongation has not been found based on the results from the Phase 2b trials
in adult subjects. 
QTcF prolongation in association with bedaquiline has been reported during 
the clinical development program and was identified as an adverse drug 
reaction (ADR). This ADR is described in the SmPC for SIRTURO.
Risk factors include a history of heart failure, a QT interval >450 ms, as 
confirmed by repeat electrocardiogram (ECG), a personal or family history of 
congenital QT prolongation, a history of or ongoing hypothyroidism, a history 
of or ongoing bradyarrhythmia, a history of Torsade de pointes or 
hypokalemia. Concomitant administration of bedaquiline with 
fluoroquinolone antibiotics that have a potential for significant QT 
prolongation (gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and sparfloxacin) is also considered 
a risk factor for QT prolongation. There is limited information available on 
the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between bedaquiline and 
medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval (including delamanid and 
levofloxacin).

Important Potential Risk: Severe hepatotoxicity
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Liver histopathological changes were seen in mice, rats, and dogs 
which were associated with relevant increases in liver biomarkers 
(ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and/or gamma-
glutamyltransferase). The observed liver histopathological changes 
did not include evidence of cholestasis and no elevation of bilirubin 
was seen.
Liver-related adverse events including increases in hepatic enzyme 
levels (eg, ALT increased, AST increased, transaminases increased, 
hepatic enzyme increased) were reported during the clinical 
development program. These events have been identified as ADRs 
and are described in the SmPC for SIRTURO.
Potential risk factors for anti-TB drug-induced hepatotoxicity 
include advanced age, female sex, low body mass index or 
malnutrition, HIV, pre-existing liver disease, genetic factors, and 
alcoholism. In the published literature, factors associated with 
hepatotoxicity include elevated baseline transaminases (ALT, AST)

Important Potential Risk: Pancreatitis
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Changes in the pancreas were observed in dogs and consisted of 
focal to multifocal chronic pancreatitis. Microvacuolation of acinar 
cells sometimes associated with minimal single acinar cell necrosis 
was observed in mice. Changes were associated with increases in 
amylase and lipase in mice, whereas there were no relevant changes 
in amylase, lipase, or trypsin-like immunoreactivity in dogs.
The risk for pancreatitis, based on nonclinical findings, is described 
in the SmPC for SIRTURO.
Pancreatic involvement in TB is more common among subjects who 
are coinfected with HIV. Among pancreatic TB cases, 23% occur in 
subjects who are HIV-positive. The prevalence of pancreatitis in the 
general population is higher for alcoholics than for nonalcoholics, 
19.9 versus 17.7 per 100,000, respectively.

Important Potential Risk: Myopathy
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Degenerative/necrotic lesions in skeletal muscle were noted in mice, 
rats, and dogs. These changes were accompanied by increases in 
AST, total creatine kinase, and myoglobin. This myopathy only 
occurred after prolonged or high dose administration and was 
usually reversible after treatment cessation or a decrease in dose.
Myalgia was reported during the clinical development program and 
has been identified as an ADR. This ADR is described in the SmPC
for SIRTURO.

Important Potential Risk: Myocardial injury
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Myocardial degeneration was seen in dogs after administration of 
bedaquiline for 6 months at high dose (40 mg/kg/day). Cardiac 
lesions consisted of minimal multifocal lymphohistiocytic infiltrates 
with degeneration of cardiomyocytes and/or minimal to slight 
endocardial fibrosis. The changes were associated with elevated 
levels of total creatine kinase and increase in cardiac troponin I.
Myocardial injury-related laboratory abnormalities were reported 
during the clinical development program; however, in the 
randomized blinded trials population the frequencies of the observed 
abnormalities were similar for bedaquiline-treated subjects and 
placebo-treated subjects with MDR-TB.
The risk for myocardial injury, based on nonclinical findings, is 
described in the SmPC for SIRTURO.
Subjects with TB myocarditis typically suffer from disseminated 
disease. It is unknown whether age or the presence of other 
symptoms are linked to the likelihood of development of 
disseminated disease. 
In the general population, elevated C-reactive protein and creatine 
kinase concentrations, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, 
and intraventricular conduction disturbances have been found to be 
associated with the risk of fulminant acute myocarditis. Risk factors 
for pericarditis include an immune-compromised state and cardiac 
surgery.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets the immune system and weakens people's defence against 
many infections and some types of cancer that people with healthy immune systems can fight off. As the virus 
destroys  and  impairs  the  function  of  immune  cells,  infected  individuals  gradually  become  immunodeficient. 
Immune function is typically measured by CD4 cell count. The most advanced stage of HIV infection is acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which can take many years to develop if not treated, depending on the 
individual. AIDS is defined by the development of certain cancers, infections or other severe long-term clinical 
manifestations. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
There were approximately 37.6 million people across the globe with HIV in 2020. Of these, 35.9 million were 
adults and 1.7 million were children (<15 years old). In 2020, 680 000 [480 000–1.0 million] people died from 
HIV-related causes and 1.5 million [1.0–2.0 million] people acquired HIV. 
As of the end of 2020, 27.4 million people with HIV (73%) were accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally. 
That means 10.2 million people are still waiting. People with HIV who are aware of their status, take ART daily 
as prescribed, and get and keep an undetectable viral load can live long, healthy lives and have effectively no 
risk of sexually transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partner. UNAIDS reports that in 2020, of all people with 
HIV worldwide: 84% knew their HIV status, 73% were accessing ART, and 66% were virally suppressed. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to be most 
infectious in the first few months after being infected, many are unaware of their status until the later stages. 
In the first few weeks after initial infection people may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness 
including  fever,  headache,  rash  or  sore  throat.  As  the  infection  progressively  weakens  the immune  system, 
they can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and 
cough.  Without  treatment,  they  could  also  develop  severe  illnesses  such  as  tuberculosis  (TB),  cryptococcal 
meningitis, severe bacterial infections, and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Standard of care for the treatment of HIV-1 infection uses combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress 
viral replication to below detectable limits, increase CD4 cell counts, and stop disease progression. For ART-
naive  HIV  infected  patients,  current  treatment  guidelines  suggest  that  initial  therapy  consist  of  two 
nucleos(t)ide  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  (N[t]RTIs)  and  either  a  non-  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase 
inhibitor  (NNRTI),  a  boosted  protease  inhibitor  (PI)  or  an  integrase  strand-transfer  inhibitor  (INSTI). 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 8/88 
 
 
 
Virologically  suppressed,  HIV  infected  patients  may  switch  from  their  current  regimen  because  of  safety  or 
tolerability  concerns  or  for  regimen  simplification.  All  patient  populations  may  benefit  from  once  daily  fixed 
dose combination (FDC) regimens as these have been shown to provide increased adherence and improved 
clinical and virologic outcomes.  
The success of ART means that morbidity and mortality in the HIV infected population is increasingly driven by 
non-AIDS–associated  comorbidities.  Clinical  attention  has  become  more  focused  on  the  optimization  of 
tolerability, long term safety, and adherence to potent ART regimens. There remains a significant medical need 
for new, effective therapies that take into consideration the non-HIV comorbidities, demographics of the aging 
HIV infected population, antiretroviral (ARV) resistance and regimen simplification.  
Chronic  kidney  disease  is  important,  since  observational  studies  have  demonstrated  a  relationship  between 
kidney disease and progression to AIDS and death. Moreover, HIV associated nephropathy presents in up to 
30% of patients and this is a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.  
ART  with  proven  efficacy  and  safety  in  both  the  elderly  and  young  patients  is  important;  limited  data  and 
treatment options are available in both populations. The elderly have increased risks for comorbidities, including 
those related to renal and bone. There are specific and complex challenges for the treatment of adolescents, 
who also represent the population that will require ART for the longest time.  
Tenofovir  (TFV)  is  a  nucleotide  analogue  with  limited  oral  bioavailability  that  inhibits  HIV-1  reverse 
transcription. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), an oral prodrug of TFV, has improved bioavailability, and 
delivers high systemic exposures of TFV with favourable efficacy and safety data. TDF is a preferred NtRTI for 
use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.  
While  TDF  is  used  broadly  in  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  infection,  an  important  identified  risk  with  its  use  is 
nephrotoxicity,  which  is  associated  with  increased  creatinine  in  some  patients,  increased  protein  loss 
(particularly tubular), and occasional cases of proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT) (including Fanconi syndrome). 
These risks necessitate increased renal monitoring with use of TDF-containing products, placing burden on the 
patient  and  healthcare  provider.  Reductions  in  bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  have  also  been  seen  after  the 
initiation of ART, with larger decreases in BMD observed with TDF than with other NRTIs.  
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an oral prodrug of TFV. TAF is more stable in plasma than TDF, provides higher 
intracellular levels of the active phosphorylated metabolite tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), and approximately 
90% lower circulating levels of TFV relative to TDF. The distinct metabolism of TAF offers the potential for an 
improved safety profile compared with TDF.  
2.2.  About the product 
Genvoya (GEN; elvitegravir [E, EVG]/cobicistat [C, COBI]/emtricitabine [F, FTC]/tenofovir alafenamide [TAF]; 
E/C/F/TAF) is an oral, once daily fixed dose combination (FDC) that provides a potent, convenient, tolerable, 
and  practical  regimen  for  the  long-term  treatment  of  patients  with  HIV-1.  At  a  so-called  “adult  strength” 
(E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg), GEN is approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients ≥ 6 years 
of  age  weighing  ≥ 25 kg  by  regulatory  authorities  including  the  United  States  (US)  Food  and  Drug 
Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) under the trade name Genvoya. 
Within the European Union (EU), Genvoya (E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg) is indicated for the treatment of 
HIV-1  infection  without  any  known  mutations  associated  with  resistance  to  the  integrase  inhibitor  class, 
emtricitabine, or tenofovir in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years and with body weight ≥ 35 kg, and in

original principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  finished  product  subject  of  this  line  extension  is  presented  as  immediate  release  film-coated  tablets 
containing  a  fixed  dose  combination  (FDC)  of  four  active  pharmaceutical  ingredients,  elvitegravir  (EVG), 
cobicistat  (COBI),  emtricitabine  (FTC),  and  tenofovir  alafenamide  fumarate  (TAF),  also  referred  to  as 
E/C/F/TAF, as 90 mg/90 mg/120 mg/6 mg film-coated tablets.  
This is a line extension of a marketed formulation containing 150/150/200/10 mg; in the market, since 2015 
(EU/1/15/1061/001-002).  
The  other  ingredients  in  the  tablet  core  are:  lactose  (as  monohydrate),  microcrystalline  cellulose  (E460), 
croscarmellose  sodium,  hydroxypropylcellulose  (E463),  silicon  dioxide  (E551),  sodium  laurilsulfate  and 
magnesium stearate. The film-coating contains: poly(vinyl alcohol) (E1203), titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol 
(E1521), talc (E553b), iron oxide yellow (E172), iron oxide black (E172).  
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene continuous-thread, 
child-resistant cap, lined with an induction activated aluminium foil liner containing 30 film-coated tablets. Each 
bottle contains silica gel desiccant and polyester coil. 
2.4.2.  Active substances 
As the finished product is a line extension of the marketed formulation Genvoya 150/150/200/10 mg tablets

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
 Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The finished product is presented as green, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablets of dimensions 16 mm x 7 mm, 
debossed with “GSI” on one side of the tablet and scored on the other side of the tablet.  
The 150/150/200/10 mg tablets are green, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablets with “GSI” debossed on one 
side and “510” on the other side. Tablet dimensions are 19 mm x 8.5 mm. The aspect of Genvoya tablets is 
shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1 - Images of Genvoya E/C/F/TAF tablets 
A. Tablet, 150/150/200/10 mg 
B. Tablet, 90/90/120/6 mg 
The composition of Genvoya tablets (current approved strength 150/150/200/10 mg and proposed strength 
90/90/120/6 mg of E/C/F/TAF) is presented in the dossier.  
Both strengths (the already authorised and the new one) of E/C/F/TAF tablets are prepared from a common 
powder blend and are dose-proportional. Tablet cores are compressed to a different core weight to achieve the 
target strength. The film coating material used for 90/90/120/6 mg tablets, is similar to that of 150/150/200/10 
mg tablets but contains different colour pigments. 
E/C/F/TAF tablets, 90/90/120/6 mg, are packaged in white, high density polyethylene bottles containing three 
(3) grams of silica gel desiccant and polyester coil. Each bottle contains 30 tablets and is capped using a white, 
continuous  thread,  child-resistant  polypropylene  screw  cap  with  an  induction-sealed,  aluminium-faced  liner. 
The container closure systems are identical (in terms of materials used) for both strengths. 
Genvoya should be taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2). The score on the proposed 90/90/120/6 
mg tablets was introduced for ease of administration. Subjects unable to swallow the whole tablet, can split it 
into halves and swallow each piece one after the other. The score line is not intended for dividing the tablets 
into equal doses. Patients are instructed to take tablets immediately after splitting and not store split tablets. 
This information is duly provided in the SmPC. Minimal loss of tablet mass during splitting was demonstrated, 
ensuring that full dose is taken when subjects split tablet and take both halves as instructed.  
During  the  procedure  the  applicant  was  asked  about  acceptability/palatability  for  the  younger  paediatric 
population. In response, it was clarified that it is not recommended to chew or crush and mix the film-coated 
tablet with food/liquids, mainly due to the poor palatability profile of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) and 
also an anticipated lower TAF exposure following crushing of tablets.

The pharmaceutical development, manufacture and control of finished product is based on those of the already 
approved  commercial  150/150/200/10  mg 
tablets.  The  pharmaceutically  and  clinically  relevant 
physicochemical  properties  of  the  active  substance  were  duly  identified,  being  adequately  specified  and 
adequately controlled. 
All excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, 
with the exception of the film-coating components which are tested against an in-house standard. There are 
no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Their functions and amounts used are well justified. No novel 
excipients or materials of animal are used in the finished product. The safety of the amount of sodium dodecyl 
sulfate (SLS) in each tablet, in long-term treatment for the paediatric population, was sufficiently addressed 
and no adverse reactions has been associated with SLS included in oral formulations. 
The dissolution testing method has been previously approved for the already approved commercial formulation 
(Tablet strength 150/150/200/10 mg). Its discriminatory power concerning crucial parameters, such as tablet 
hardness, and particle size have been addressed. 
 Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  several  main  steps:  blending  of  the  active  substance  with 
intragranular/extragranular excipients, fluid-bed granulation/dry granulation and milling, compression, tablet 
film-coating and packaging. 
The finished product is produced using a standard manufacturing process. No design space has been proposed. 
The manufacturing process for 150/150/200/10 mg tablets and 90/90/120/6 mg tablets, is identical through 
to the final blending step. A portion of the final blend is used for manufacturing the 90/90/120/6 mg tablets. 
The  compression  and  coating  steps  are  fundamentally  equivalent  between  the  two  strengths  except  for  the 
differences introduced by tablet size, shape, film-coating material and the scale of the compression and coating 
processing equipment.  
In–process  controls  during  the  manufacture  have  been  established  based  on  data  and  manufacturing 
experience  from  development,  clinical,  primary  stability  and  scale-up  batches.  Manufacturing  process  and 
control strategy used to produce E/C/F/TAF final powder blend for 90/90/120/6 mg tablets is identical to that 
developed and validated for 150/150/200/10 mg strength tablets. 
The material output at each process step is controlled by the equipment operating parameters and by testing 
intermediates during the manufacturing process. Manufacturing process validation data for the 90/90/120/6 
mg tablets comply with acceptance criteria for content uniformity and the process is considered fully validated.  
The validation plan for the manufacturing process of E/C/F/TAF tablets, 90/90/120/6 mg has been provided 
and found to be acceptable. 
 Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The release and shelf-life specifications for the finished product Genvoya 90/90/120/6 mg tablets, include tests 
for  appearance,  identification  (HPLC,  UPLC/UV),  water  content  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (UPLC/UV),  degradation 
products  (UPLC/UV),  uniformity  of  dosage units  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  microbial  examination 
(Ph. Eur.). 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 12/88 
 
 
The justification of the tests and acceptance criteria are provided. Specifications are well justified and aligned 
with the recommendations of ICH guidelines Q6A and Q3B(R2). The 90/90/120/6 mg tablets, have the same 
formulation composition as the 150/150/200/10 mg tablets, apart from the slight difference in the film-coating 
and tablet core weight. A common powder blend is used in the manufacture of both tablet strengths. Therefore, 
except  for  appearance,  the  tests,  test  methods,  and  acceptance  criteria  for  90/90/120/6  mg  tablets,  are 
equivalent to those for the approved 150/150/200/10 mg tablets. 
No information is provided in section 3.2.P.5.5. characterisation of impurities. As this section is applicable to 
both  the  approved  strength  and  for  the  new  strength  and  no  changes  have  been  made  within  the  current 
extension of indication, this is acceptable.  
The specified degradation products for the active substances COBI on silicon dioxide, FTC, TAF fumarate, in the 
specification  for  90/90/120/6  mg  tablets,  have  been  toxicologically  qualified  and  the  qualification  levels  are 
supportive of the acceptance limits in for the administration of E/C/F/TAF tablets to the paediatric population 
of age 2 to <12 years old, body weight of 14 to <25 kg. 
Elemental  Impurities  and  nitrosamine  impurities  were  considered  for  inclusion  in  the  finished  product 
specification, according to ICH guidelines Q3C, Q6A and Q3D. After evaluation of the control strategy for these 
attributes and relevant data, it is considered that a test for these attributes was not necessary.  
The elemental impurities risk assessment provided for 150/150/200/10 mg tablets, applies also 90/90/120/6 
mg tablets. Therefore, testing for elemental impurities in the latter is considered unnecessary. Likewise, the 
nitrosamines risk assessment provided for 150/150/200/10 mg tablets applies also to 90/90/120/6 mg tablets. 
This  is  because  the  formulation  compositions,  manufacturing  processes,  manufacturing  equipment  and 
packaging  components  are  similar.  Therefore,  no  risk  is  identified  on  the  formation  and  contamination  of 
nitrosamines 90/90/120/6 mg tablets, at the end of product shelf-life. 
The methods of analysis and the reference standards are the same as those used for the authorised strength; 
the information is sufficient. 
The  manufacturing  history  on  the  batches  90/90/120/6  mg  tablets,  manufactured  for  clinical  and  stability 
studies, is presented and batch analysis results are provided. All results comply with the specifications. 
 Stability of the product 
Stability data from several commercial scale batches of the 90/90/120/6 mg tablets stored for up to 36 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Stability  studies  included  all  quality  attributes:  appearance,  strength,  degradation  product  content,  water 
content, dissolution, and microbiological purity. All parameters met the proposed shelf-life specifications. 
No  significant  change  on  any  of  the  test  attributes  monitored  at  the  accelerated  storage  condition  of 
40 °C / 75% RH.  
Stress  and  photostability  studies  were  not  conducted  on  low  dose  FDC,  because  studies  have  already  been 
conducted, and approved, on 150/150/200/10 mg tablets, which have the same formulation composition, apart 
from the film-coating material. The 150/150/200/10 mg tablets are stable when stored for up to 4 days at -20

°C, 50 °C and 60 ºC, and are not photolabile. Considering that in-use stability data has been obtained for the 
higher strength which is manufactured from the same final powder blend, and therefore the composition of the 
tablet core is the same, it is acceptable that the in-use study is not repeated for the lower strength.  
Based on stability studies, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years for the finished product packaged in the proposed 
container closure system without any special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) 
is acceptable. The post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment is also acceptable.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  During  the  procedure  the  safety  of  the  formulation  for  the  proposed 
paediatric  population  has  been  demonstrated.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacologic basis to recommend the E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg for the treatment of HIV infection in 
children ≥ 2 years old and weighing ≥14 kg to < 25kg is scientifically sound based on the nonclinical in vitro 
and in vivo efficacy data available for the individual components and the combination of the agents.

The  E/C/F/TAF  FDC  is  not  anticipated  to  produce  any  new  human  metabolites.  Because  significant 
pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely (other than the intended pharmacokinetic boosting of EVG by COBI) 
and  that  the  target  organ  profiles  are  different,  administration  of  the  combination  product  is  unlikely  to 
exacerbate known toxicities of the individual agents. The increase in TAF exposure due to inhibition of intestinal 
efflux by COBI has been taken into account during the TAF clinical dose selection for E/C/F/TAF FDC. 
No new pharmacology data was presented as part of this submission. This is acceptable given the existing data 
and previously assessed data. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of EVG, COBI, FTC, TAF, and TFV are well characterized in multiple animal species 
and the findings are pertinent in consideration of the use of these agents in combination. Additional data from 
clinical studies of the E/C/F/TAF FDC demonstrated acceptable tolerability and safety profiles to support use in 
patients ≥ 2 years old.

efflux by COBI has been taken into account during the TAF clinical dose selection for E/C/F/TAF FDC. 
No new pharmacokinetic data was presented as part of this submission. This is acceptable given the existing 
data and previously assessed data. 
2.5.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicologic profile of EVG, COBI, FTC, TAF, and TFV are well characterized in multiple animal species and 
the findings are pertinent in consideration of the use of these agents in combination. Data from clinical studies 
of the E/C/F/TAF FDC demonstrated acceptable tolerability and safety profiles to support use in patients ≥ 2 
years old. 
The  toxicity  profiles  of  the  4  agents  differ  substantially  with  no  clinically  significant  overlapping  toxicity. 
Nonclinical  studies  with  EVG  have  not  identified  any  specific  target  organ  toxicities  or  cause  for  concern. 
Potential toxicities related to COBI observed in nonclinical toxicology studies (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
and  urinalysis  changes;  lower  IgG  antibody  titers;  and  adaptive  liver  and  thyroid  changes)  have  not  been 
observed in clinical studies with the E/C/F/TAF FDC tablet. The only toxicity observed in chronic animal studies 
with  FTC  was  mild,  reversible  anemia  at large  multiples  of  clinical exposure;  therefore,  these hematological 
findings are not considered relevant to clinical use. Emtricitabine has an established clinical safety profile in 
children with no significant toxicities observed. The principal target organs of toxicity in animals following oral 
administration of TAF were the kidney (karyomegaly, tubular degeneration) and bone. 
Available non-clinical data, along with clinical data, suggest that COBI reversibly blocks secretion of creatinine 
in humans. With no apparent pathological change in the kidney due to COBI, the routes of excretion differ for 
TFV and COBI, and that COBI would not be expected to inhibit the major renal transporters of TFV at clinically 
relevant  concentrations,  it  is  not  anticipated  that  the  combination  of  E/C/F/TAF  could  exacerbate  the  renal 
toxicity  of  TAF.  The  small  increase  in  serum  creatinine  levels  may  be  associated  with  inhibition  of  MATE1 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 15/88 
 
 
mediated creatinine secretion by COBI. In fact, in the Phase 3 pivotal trials, the E/C/F/TAF FDC produces a 
smaller increase in serum creatinine than the E/C/F/TDF FDC. 
The  mild  hematological  changes  with  FTC  should  not  cause  an  overlapping  toxicity  with  COBI  which  was 
associated with minimal decreases in RBC parameters in rats. 
Cobicistat, EVG, and FTC have not shown any potential for bone toxicity in chronic rat and dog toxicity studies; 
thus, exacerbation of any TAF effects on bone is not expected. 
None of the 4 compounds had positive findings in genotoxicity studies. The E/C/F/TAF FDC is not anticipated 
to alter the genotoxicity profiles of the individual agents. 
EVG,  COBI,  FTC,  and  TDF/TFV  have  all  demonstrated  low  carcinogenic  potential  in  conventional  2-year 
bioassays. Combination dosing would not be expected to change these profiles, and no exacerbation of toxicity 
is expected. 
EVG, FTC, TAF, and COBI have not shown significant adverse effects in reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies. In the EVG juvenile toxicity phase of the pre/postnatal study in rats, daily oral gavage administration 
of  EVG  to  F1  generation  pups  from  postnatal  day  (PND)  22  to  49  was  well  tolerated  at  doses  up  to  2000 
mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for toxicity of EVG is 2000 mg/kg/day for juvenile rats where the mean exposure on 
PND  28  (169  μg.h/mL)  was  5-fold  higher  than  therapeutic  human  exposures  at  the  90  mg  dose  in  HIV-1 
infected subjects ≥2 years old administered E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg (GS-US-292-0106 Interim 5 CSR). In 
the COBI juvenile toxicity phase of the pre/postnatal study in rats, daily oral gavage administration of COBI to 
F1 generation pups from PND 22 to 49 was well tolerated at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for toxicity 
of COBI is 75 mg/kg/day for juvenile rats where exposures on PND 49 (20.9 μg.h/mL) was 1.4-fold higher than 
therapeutic  human  exposures  at  the  90  mg  dose  in  HIV-1  infected  subjects  ≥  2  years  old  administered 
E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg (GS US 292 0106 Interim 5 CSR). 
Identified  impurities  and  degradants  have  been  assessed  as  part  of  the  routine  toxicology  or  qualification 
studies with the individual agents and with the EVG/COBI and FTC/TDF combinations. No unexpected toxicity 
was observed. 
The absence of nonclinical safety studies with the E/C/F/TAF combination is in accordance with the CHMP 
Guideline on the Non-Clinical Development of Fixed Combinations of Medicinal Products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005, January 2008). There are no anticipated clinically relevant pharmacokinetic 
or toxicological interactions expected in the E/C/F/TAF FDC beyond the anticipated pharmacokinetic boosting 
of EVG by COBI. EVG, COBI, FTC and TAF have been assessed individually in comprehensive nonclinical 
programs. Information from all nonclinical studies with EVG, COBI, FTC and TAF are, therefore, considered in 
the context of the substantial clinical experience with E/C/F/TAF for the treatment of HIV 1 infection. No new 
adverse drug reactions have been identified from the post marketing cases of ≥ 6 year olds prescribed 
E/C/F/TAF for treatment of HIV-1 infection. The E/C/F/TAF FDC is considered to have low potential for toxicity 
in the pediatric patient population ≥ 2 years of age and the existing nonclinical and clinical data supports the 
proposed use. 
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  was  performed  separately  for  each  active  substance,  elvitegravir 
(EVG), cobicistat (COBI), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) fumarate, based on the CHMP 
guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  EU  guideline

(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, EMA 2006) and according to  EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1 (EMA- 
Questions and answers on “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human 
use” -CHMP 2016). 
ERA  report’s  structure  and  requirements  fulfilled  the  relevant  EU  guidelines.  The  studies  were  conducted 
according  to  appropriate  OECD  test  guidelines  and  under  GLP  conditions.  Protocols  of  the  ecotoxicological 
studies were sufficiently detailed to confirm compliance and references made to OECD tests were appropriate. 
A comprehensible, concise, and detailed ERA report for the 4 active substances was provided, comprising Phase 
I, Phase II Tier A, and Phase II Tier B.  GLP compliant fate and effects studies were reported. All the relevant 
information  required  was  given  and  based  on  the  scientific  discussion  of  the  results  obtained,  the  potential 
environmental impact related to their use was assessed.  
The main results for Phase I and II assessment and the analysis of the results are reported in the following 
tables (Tables 3-6).

2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH did not conduct the usual nonclinical studies to specifically support the use of Genvoya in children 
≥ 2 years  of  age  weighing  ≥  14  to  <  25  kg  and  consequently,  no  module  2.6  data  were  provided  with  this 
application. According to the MAH, the summary of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies 
of EVG, COBI, FTC and TAF provided in module 2.4 Nonclinical Overview included in the submission to support 
the extension of the indication for E/C/F/TAF in children 6 to <12 years old and weighing at least 25 kg with 
HIV-1 infection is relevant to the current assessment of E/C/F/TAF in children ≥ 2  years of age, and this is 
endorsed. The MAH made an updated Integrated Assessment, to support the use of E/C/F/TAF in children ≥ 2 
years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg considering the available data. This is acceptable given the existing and 
previously assessed data. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
The  n-octanol/water  partition  coefficient  experimental  values  for  EVG,  COBI,  FTC  and  TAF  were  determined 
experimentally  in  accordance  with  OECD  guideline  107  Partition  Coefficient  (n-octanol/water):  Shake  Flask 
Method. For each active ingredient the result was < 4.5, the guideline Phase I action limit for PBT(Persistence, 
Bioaccumulation,  Toxicity)  assessment.  Therefore,  no  further  assessment  of  PBT  was  required.  All  4  active 
substances were not considered to have met the persistent, bioaccumulation and toxic (PBT) criteria. 
The  predicted  environmental  concentrations  PECsurfacewater,  both  the  worst-case  and  refined  values  for 
prevalence of HIV, for the 4 active substances were higher than the trigger value of 0.01 µg/L and therefore a 
full Phase II assessment is required. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 31/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Phase II: The most relevant methods were used, and the results obtained were discussed. Scientific evidence 
is summarised for each active substance in tables 1 to 4. 
All the 4 active substances are classified as not readily biodegradable according to OECD 301 and are considered 
potentially  persistent.  Therefore,  an  OECD  308  test  was  performed  to  evaluate  P  criterion,  and  FTC  was 
considered to be persistent in the environment. 
The log Pow of FTC and TFV at both pH 7 and 9 were below the Phase II A trigger of 3, as such, no further 
assessment of bioconcentration and secondary poisoning was required in Phase II B. Nevertheless, both EVG, 
COBI have a Kow value that triggered an assessment of the potential for bioconcentration. Neither EVG nor 
COBI bioconcentrate in fish tissues. 
EVG strongly adsorbed to sewage solids (Kd > 3,700) requiring an assessment in the terrestrial environment 
in Phase II tier B. However, RQ value for the most sensitive endpoint is less than 1, indicating that EVG poses 
an acceptable risk to the terrestrial environment. 
All four active substances partition to sediment to an extent that triggered assessment of the risk to sediment 
dwellers. The calculated RQs for sediment dweller was < 1 demonstrate that EVG, COBI, FTC and TFV poses 
an acceptable risk to sediment dwelling organisms. 
EVG, COBI, FTC and TFV risk quotient (RQ) values less than 1 were obtained for sewage microbes, fish, aquatic 
invertebrates and algae. Similarly, an RQ below the trigger value of 1 was obtained for groundwater. The data 
indicate  that  the  environmentally  relevant  residues  of  EVG,  COBI,  FTC  and  TFV  are  of  low  risk  for  all 
compartments. Therefore, no risk for the environment is to be expected. 
From the results of ERA studies, no significant environmental safety issues were identified. 
Since no environmental concerns are apparent, it is assumed that EVG, COBI, FTC and TAF (as TFV) are unlikely 
to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients, including the children and 
adolescents (aged ≥ 2 years weighing at least 14 Kg>), the purpose of the current line extension. 
Based on the data obtained for the Phase II-A and B assessments, the proposed use of Genvoya as a treatment 
for HIV poses an acceptable risk to the environment. 
The  approval  of  the  current  line  extension  will  not  lead  to  any  unacceptable  risks  to  aquatic  or  terrestrial 
environments. 
As a general rule for all pharmaceutical products, in order to reduce environmental exposure, it is recommended 
not to dispose them via wastewater or the municipal drainage system and to return them to the pharmacy for 
appropriate disposal. The precautionary and safety measures taken to reduce any risk to the environment by 
including the general statement on the SmPC and PL have been applied, which is agreed on and appreciated. 
2.5.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The overall existing non-clinical programme to date, including data from the combination and individual drug 
studies, supports the efficacy and safety of E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg tablet in the sought indication. 
Based  on  the  available  data,  the  use  of  Genvoya,  a  fixed  dose  combination  product,  containing  elvitegravir 
(EVG), cobicistat (COBI), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), 90/90/120/6 mg tablet, in the 
sought indication, poses an acceptable risk to the environment.

2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
 Pharmacokinetics 
A primary objective in relation to subjects enrolled in Cohort 3 in Study GS-US-292-0106 was to evaluate the 
PK  of  EVG  and  TAF  and  confirm  the  dose  of  a  GEN  LD  tablet  (E/C/F/TAF  90/90/120/6  mg)  in  virologically 
suppressed HIV-1 infected children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg. The safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral  activity  of  GEN  LD  tablets  were  also  evaluated  in  Cohort  3.  Dose  selection  for  the  GEN  LD  tablet 
targeted systemic exposures similar to those observed in adults, and took into consideration WT/body surface 
area  and  potential  ontogenic  changes  in  transporters  and  metabolic  enzymes  that  govern  the  disposition  of 
EVG, COBI, FTC, TAF, and TFV (TAF major metabolite). 
Intensive PK data were available for 27 HIV-1 infected children who received the GEN LD tablet (E/C/F/TAF 
90/90/120/6  mg).  No  clinically  relevant  differences  in  exposures  of  EVG,  COBI,  FTC,  TAF,  and  TFV  were 
observed between pediatric subjects who received the GEN LD tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) and adults 
who received the adult-strength GEN tablet (E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg). 
Population  PK  models  were  developed  to  characterize  the  exposures  of  EVG,  COBI,  TAF,  and  TFV  in  HIV-1 
infected adolescents and children, including the use of all available intensive and sparse plasma concentration 
data. Population PK parameters for EVG, COBI, TAF, and TFV were predicted and are presented in the following 
sections. For FTC, PK parameters estimated from the intensive PK samples from Cohort 3 subjects were used.

To confirm the appropriateness of the E/C/F/TAF dose in virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected children ≥ 2 
years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg:  
1) PopPK parameters AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau for EVG, and AUCtau and Cmax for TAF (Ctau was not included 
due to  the  short  t1/2 of  TAF)  were  compared  to  historical  PopPK  data in  HIV-1  infected  adults  treated with 
E/C/F/TAF using a PK equivalence boundary of 70% to 143% for AUCtau;  
2) Pop PK parameters AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau for COBI and TFV were compared to historical PopPK data in 
HIV-1 infected adults treated with E/C/F/TAF;  
3) PK parameters AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau for FTC estimated from intensive PK samples from Cohort 3 were 
compared to historical PopPK data in HIV-1 infected adults treated with E/C/F/TAF. 
Pharmacokinetics of TAF in HIV-1 Infected Paediatric Subjects 
Predicted systemic exposures of TAF in children weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg (Cohort 3, Study GS-US-292-0106) 
receiving the GEN LD tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) were compared with those from HIV-1 infected adult 
subjects receiving the GEN adult-strength tablet (E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg) in Phase 2 Studies GS-US-
292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 (N = 539). 
TAF AUCtau in children weighing ≥ 14 to < 25  kg receiving the GEN LD tablet was similar to that in adults 
(Table 7). The 90% CIs of the associated geometric least squares mean (GLSM) ratio for AUCtau were within 
the predefined PK equivalence boundary of 70% to 143%. The modestly lower (29%) TAF Cmax in children 
weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg was not deemed clinically relevant based on the favourable efficacy profile of the 
GEN LD tablet, and was within the safe and efficacious range of historical data in adult and paediatric subjects 
in the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF and E/C/F/TAF development programs.

Pharmacokinetics of EVG in HIV-1 Infected Paediatric Subjects 
Predicted systemic exposures of EVG in children weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg (Cohort 3, Study GS-US-292-0106) 
receiving the GEN LD tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) were compared with those from HIV-1 infected adult 
subjects receiving the adult-strength tablet (E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg) in the Phase 2 Study GS-US-292-
0102 (N = 19). 
The  geometric  mean  of  EVG  AUCtau  in  children  weighing  ≥  14  to  <  25  kg  was  26%  higher  than  in  adult 
subjects.  The  upper  limit  of  the  90%  CIs  of  the  GLSM  ratios  for  AUCtau  exceeded  the  143%  equivalence 
boundary (Table 9). EVG Cmax and Ctau in children weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg receiving the LD E/C/F/TAF were 
similar to those in adults. 
The modestly higher EVG AUCtau in children weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg is not deemed clinically relevant based 
on the favourable safety profile of the GEN LD tablet, and is within the safe and efficacious range of historical 
data in adult and paediatric subjects in the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF and E/C/F/TAF development programs.

COBI  Cmax  and  Ctau  in  children  weighing  ≥  14  to <  25  kg  were  similar  to those  in  adults  (Table 10).  The 
modestly higher (23%) COBI AUCtau in children weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg was not deemed clinically relevant 
based  on  the  favourable  safety  profile  of  the  GEN  LD  tablet,  and  is within the  safe  and  efficacious  range  of 
historical  data  in  adult  and  paediatric  subjects  in  the  EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF  and  E/C/F/TAF  development 
programs.

Pharmacokinetics of FTC in HIV-1 Infected Paediatric Subjects 
Observed  systemic  exposures  of  FTC  derived  from  intensive  PK  data  in  children  weighing  ≥  14  to  <  25  kg 
(Cohort 3, Study GS-US-292-0106; Table 11) receiving the GEN LD tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) were 
compared with those from HIV-1 infected adult subjects receiving the adult-strength GEN tablet (E/C/F/TAF 
150/150/200/10 mg) in the Phase 2 Study GS-US-292-0102 (N = 19). 
The geometric means of FTC Ctau were similar in children weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg in Cohort 3 and adult 
subjects in the Phase 2 Study GS-US-292-0102. The geometric means of FTC AUCtau and Cmax in children in 
Cohort 3 were, respectively, 61% and 39% higher than in adult subjects. These differences are not deemed 
clinically relevant based on the favourable safety profile of the GEN LD tablet, and FTC exposure parameters 
were within the safe and efficacious range of historical data in adult and paediatric subjects in the E/C/F/TAF 
development program.

Impaired renal function 
EVG, COBI, and TAF 
Baseline  CLCRSW  (i.e.  the  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate)  was  not  identified  as  a  statistically  significant 
covariate for EVG, COBI, or TAF PK in their respective final PopPK models. The impact of baseline CLCRSW on 
EVG, COBI, and TAF exposures for Cohort 3 subjects ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg in Study GS-
US-292-0106 were presented. In paediatric subjects, EVG, COBI, and TAF exposures were generally similar 
across the range of baseline CLCRSW values. 
TFV 
Baseline CLCRSW was identified as a statistically significant covariate for TFV PK in the final PopPK model. This 
was as expected since TFV is renally eliminated. The impact of baseline CLCRSW on TFV exposure in Cohort 3 
subjects ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg receiving the GEN LD tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) 
in  Study  GS-US-292-0106  is  presented  in  Table  12.  Among  these  paediatric  subjects,  TFV  exposures  were 
generally similar across the range of baseline CLCRSW values.

No new information was submitted. 
Gender 
Sex was not identified as a statistically significant covariate for EVG, COBI, TAF, or TFV in their respective final

Race was not identified as a statistically significant covariate for EVG, COBI, or TFV in the respective final PopPK 
model.  In  paediatric  subjects,  EVG,  COBI,  and  TFV  exposures  were  generally  similar  between  race  groups. 
However, the comparisons may not be robust due to the limited sample sizes within each race category. 
TAF 
Race was identified as a statistically significant covariate for TAF PK in its final PopPK model once body size 
was accounted for, with a lower apparent VC/F estimated in Asian subjects, but this did not result in significant 
changes in PK exposure parameters. The impact of race on TAF exposures in Cohort 3 subjects ≥ 2 years of 
age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg receiving GEN LD tablets (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) in Study GS-US-292-

sample sizes within each race category.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Study  GS-US-292-0106  is  an  open-label,  multicentre,  multicohort,  single-group  study  of  the  PK,  safety, 
tolerability, and antiviral activity of GEN (E/C/F/TAF) in HIV-1 infected, ART-naive adolescents and virologically 
suppressed  children.  Subjects  received  1  GEN  LD  tablet  (90/90/120/6  mg)  daily,  orally  with  food,  at 
approximately the same time each day. Intensive PK assessments were made at the Week 2 visit for 27 patients 
and  a  non-compartmental  PK  analysis  was  made.  The  primary  PK  endpoint  was  AUCtau  for  TAF  and  EVG. 
Geometric mean AUCtau values for TAF and EVG, respectively, were 93% and 39% higher than in E/C/F/TAF-
treated,  HIV-1  infected  adults  in  historical  studies.  For  TFV,  the  exposure  parameter  AUCtau  was  similar  to 
those observed in adult subjects. For COBI, the geometric mean AUCtau was 37% higher in Cohort 3 subjects 
than  in  adult  subjects.  For  FTC,  the  geometric  mean  of  AUCtau  was  61%  higher  than  in  adult  subjects. 
Generally, the exposures are higher than the ones observed with adult patients, although inside the expected 
values of that population. The GEN LD tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) was well tolerated and High rates 
of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) were maintained. 
Validation methods for tenofovir alafenamide (GS-7340), tenofovir (TFV) emtricitabine (FTC), elvitegravir (GS-
9137)  and  cobicistat  (GS-9350)  were  provided.  The  analytical  methods  used  in  the  clinical  studies  for  the 
determination of the studied drugs were well developed and sufficiently validated (both pre- and within study) 
and have been already used (and assessed) in previous applications. All samples were analysed within the time 
frame supported by long-term storage stability data. ISR analysis was performed for all the analytes.  
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  estimated  using  Phoenix  WinNonlin  software  by  application  of  standard 
noncompartmental methods. The linear/log trapezoidal rule was used in conjunction with the appropriate non-
compartmental model with input values for dose, time of dose, plasma concentration, and corresponding real-
time  values  based  on  drug  dosing  times  whenever possible.  This  is  standard  and  acceptable.  Population  PK 
modelling was conducted using NONMEM and models were established to describe the plasma PK for COBI, 
EVG, TAF, and TFV in HIV-1 infected adolescents and children using data collected across several studies, and 
estimate typical values and between-subject variability of PK parameters. No PopPK study was presented for

emtricitabine. The applicant justified the reason for not presenting a PopPK analysis by the fact that the original 
dose  selection  of  emtricitabine  at  the  registration  of  Emtriva  was  made  based  on  rich  sampling  and 
noncompartmental  analysis.  However,  the  applicant  has  already  made  a  commitment  with  the  PDCO  for 
developing a PopPK model for FCT. 
Two PopPK studies were presented.  
The first considered a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Cobicistat and Cobicistat-Boosted Elvitegravir in 
HIV-1 Infected Adolescents and Children and included data from Studies GS-US-292-0106, GS-US-292-1515, 
GS-US-236-0112, and GS-US-216-0128. The base model for pediatric EVG was developed based on previously 
developed models and the addition of covariates was made by forward addition and backward deletion. The 
final  pediatric  EVG  model  was  described  by  a  2-compartment  model  with  sequential  zero  and  first-order 
absorption and first-order elimination. Between-subject variability was included on CL/F, Vp/F, Q/F, and D1. A 
combined error model was used to characterize residual variability (RV). Baseline WT effects were included on 
clearance (ie, CL/F, Q/F) and distribution-related parameters (ie, Vc/F, Vp/F) using fixed allometric exponents 
of  0.75  and  1,  respectively.  In  addition,  ka  was  estimated  separately  for  each  FDC  (E/C/F/TAF  and 
EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF  [Stribild])  to  improve  the  fit  of  the  absorption  phase.  No  additional  covariates  were 
included. The final model parameters were estimated with good confidence (the percentage of RSE was < 30% 
for  fixed-effects  parameters  and  <  40%  for  random-effects  parameters),  presented  reasonable  to  high 
shrinkage  (<72%  for  Q/F)  and  were  confirmed  by  bootstrapping.  GOF  plots  were  acceptable  as  well  as  the 
presented  pcVPC  (stratified  by  weight).  The  base  model  for  paediatric  COBI  was  developed  also  based  on 
previously developed models and the addition of covariates was again made by forward addition and backward 
deletion. The final paediatric COBI model was described by a 1-compartment model with sequential zero-order 
and first-order absorption with a lag time and first-order elimination. Between-subject variability was included 
on CL/F, D1, and lag time (ALAG), with an OMEGA block to estimate the correlation between CL/F and D1. A 
proportional  error  model  with  between-subject  variability  was  used  to  characterize  RV.  Effects  of  WT  were 
included on CL/F and Vc/F using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively. No additional covariates 
were  found  to  significantly  affect  COBI  exposure.  The  final  model  parameters  were  estimated  with  good 
confidence  (percentage  of  RSE  for  fixed-effect  parameters  were  generally  <  30%  and  <  55%  for  ETA 
[variability] terms) and were confirmed by bootstrapping. Bayesian shrinkage values were low for CL/F and 
proportional error (< 10%), but higher shrinkage values were observed for D1 and ALAG (42% for each). GOF 
plots were acceptable as well as the presented pcVPC (stratified by weight) although the 95th percentile showed 
a tendency toward overprediction. 
The second considered a population pharmacokinetic analysis of tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir following 
administration of tenofovir alafenamide-containing–fixed-dose combinations in HIV-1-infected adolescents and 
children. Data was collected across various TAF-based regimens (Studies GS-US-292-0106, GS-US-292-1515, 
GS-US-311-1269, and GS-US-380-1474) and was used to develop sequential PK model(s) of TAF and TFV in 
HIV-1-infected  adolescents  and  children.  Addition  of  covariates  was  again  made  by  forward  addition  and 
backward deletion. The final paediatric TAF model, simplified from previous TAF PopPK analysis due to various 
reproducibility and robustness issues, was described by a 1-compartment model with sequential zero- and first-
order absorption and first-order elimination. Between-subject variability was included on the duration of zero-
order absorption only and resulted in a high value of 108%. A combined error model was used to characterize 
residual variability, with the inclusion of between-subject variability on the proportional error term. Baseline 
WT  effects  were  included  on  CL/F  and  Vc/F  using  fixed  allometric  exponents  of  0.75  and  1,  respectively. 
Cobicistat  was  found  to  affect  relative  bioavailability  of  TAF  (163.6%  increase),  whereas  lopinavir/ritonavir-
boosted TAF was found to yield comparable exposure to unboosted TAF. In addition, TAF Vc/F was found to be 
lower  in  Asian  subjects  (-78.8%  reduction).  No  additional  covariates  were  found  to  significantly  affect  TAF

exposure.  The  final  model  parameters  were  estimated  with  good  confidence  (%RSE  <10%),  presented  low 
shrinkage (<25%) and were confirmed by bootstrapping. GOF plots were acceptable as well as the presented 
pcVPC (stratified by weight and by booster groups) although missing on the higher observed values and not 
entirely able to predict the values around Tmax. This was the result of several model simplifications that were 
made in order to achieve stability. The final paediatric sequential TAF-TFV model was described by the previous 
sequential 1-compartment TAF model and a 2-compartment TFV model with first-order elimination was found 
to  best  describe  the  TFV  paediatric  data.  A  parallel  absorption  compartment  with  first-order  process  was 
introduced  in  the  model  to  describe  TFV  data  in  the  presence  of  the  LPV/RTV  booster.  Between-subject 
variability was included on apparent oral clearance of TFV (CLM/F), apparent inter-compartmental clearance of 
TFV  (QM/F),  VcM/F,  and  apparent  peripheral  volume  of  distribution  of  TFV  (VpM/F);  and  a  combined 
proportional and additive error model was used to characterize the Residual Variability. The estimated LPV/RTV 
effect on TFV relative bioavailability (F) was 209.5% increase. Effects of WT were included on CLM/F, QM/F, 
VcM/F, and VpM/F using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, for clearances and volumes of distribution, 
respectively. In addition, baseline creatinine clearance derived by Schwartz equation was found to significantly 
affect CLM/F. No additional covariates were found to significantly affect TAF exposure. Most of the final model 
parameters  were  estimated  with  good  precision  (%RSE  <25%)  and  presented  low  shrinkage  (<20%). 
Parameter were also confirmed by bootstrapping. GOF plots were acceptable as well as the presented pcVPC 
(stratified by weight and by booster groups).  
Taking into account that the experimental data to build the model are the same in modeling reports QP-
2018-1027 TAF TFV HIV Pediatric Pop PK and CTRA-2020-1048 TAF-TFV Peds Pop PK, it is unclear how the 
TAF structural model may differ between both reports. Similarly, the discrepancies in terms of parameter 
estimates of TAF and TFV between the two reports are not reassuring. Based also on these concerns, a new 
PopPK analysis was performed by the applicant with updated models for TAF and COBI. These updated 
models included a better description of the absorption process (inclusion of lag time for TAF and removal of 
the lag time for COBI) and better description of the IIV, as well as some addition of new available data. A 
comparison of results from the different versions of the models was presented and the current version 
parameter estimates now are better related to the initial version model developed in 2018. Overall, these 
changes improved also considerable the model performance for both drugs when compared to the previous 
2020 version.  
Besides the typical summary statistics, comparison of the rich data PK in children in Cohort 3 against adults 
from  historical  studies  for  TAF  EVG,  COBI,  FTC,  and  TFV  was  made  by  one-way  analysis  of  variance  model 
fitted to the natural logarithmic-transformed PK values. This is acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
The  new  proposed  low  dosage  (LD)  strength  was  not  directly  compared  in  a  bioequivalence  study  with  the 
original dosage strength already approved. However, this new LD was used in the clinical Study GS-US-292-
0106 in the target population. The two dosage strengths are fully dose proportional and the applicant provided 
the  in  vitro  dissolution  profiles  at  pH  1.2,  4.5,  6.8  dissolution  medium  and  at  the  QC  medium.  These were 
similar in all the conditions and for all the drugs. 
Regarding  the  pharmacokinetics  in  target  population,  a  primary  objective  in  relation  to  subjects  enrolled  in 
Cohort 3 in Study GS-US-292-0106 was to evaluate the PK of EVG and TAF and confirm the dose of the GEN 
LD tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) in HIV-1 infected children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg 
(Cohort  3).  Dose  selection  for  the  GEN  LD  tablet  targeted  systemic  exposures  similar  to  those  observed  in 
adults and took into account WT and body surface area and potential ontogenic changes in transporters and

metabolic enzymes that govern the disposition of EVG, COBI, FTC, TAF, and the TAF metabolite TFV (a prior 
work performed based on PBPK simulations). 
Intensive  PK  data  were  available  from  27  virologically  suppressed  HIV-1  infected  Cohort  3  subjects  who 
received the GEN LD tablet. Based on this PK parameters AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau for EVG, COBI FTC and TFV 
and AUCtau and Cmax for TAF (Ctau was not included due to the short t1/2 of TAF) were compared to historical 
PopPK data in HIV-1 infected adults treated with E/C/F/TAF using a PK equivalence boundary of 70% to 143% 
for AUCtau; Although not always with the 90% CI inside the acceptance criteria (in particular TAF with a AUCtau 
90%CI of 166% to 224% and FTC with a AUCtau 90% CI of 143% to 180%), most of the GLSM ratios were 
included in the equivalence boundaries, not only for AUCtau but also for the remaining parameters. The same 
was generally observed when the PK parameters were determined by PopPK analysis for TAF, TFV, EVG and 
COBI.  It  seems  that,  where  there  were  differences,  these  exposures  are  falling  within  safe  and  efficacious 
ranges  of  historical  data  in  adult  subjects  variously  in  the  EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF  and  E/C/F/TAF  development 
programs.  
Intrinsic Factors 
The impact of renal function was tested by the PopPK model considering ClCr as a covariate. Baseline CLCRSW 
was  not  identified  as  a  statistically  significant  covariate  for  EVG,  COBI,  and  TAF  PK  in  their  respective  final 
PopPK models. In addition, EVG, COBI, and TAF exposures were generally similar across the range of baseline 
CLCRSW  values  In  paediatric  subjects.  On  the  contrary,  baseline  CLCRSW  was  identified  as  a  statistically 
significant covariate for TFV PK in the final PopPK model. This is as expected since TFV is renally eliminated. In 
paediatric subjects, TFV exposures were generally similar across the range of baseline CLCRSW values (115 – 
179 ml/min/1.73m2 for the Cohort 3 population). These findings go in line with the adult population, although 
all paediatric HIV-1 Infected Subjects presented normal renal function. 
Gender was not considered a relevant covariate on the EVG, COBI, TAF or TFV popPK models and goes in line 
with previous findings in the adult population. 
Race was identified as a statistically significant covariate for TAF PK in its final PopPK model once body size 
was  accounted  for.  However,  the  limited  sample  sizes  within  each  race  category  would  prevent  a  robust 
quantification of the effects of race on BIC exposures. For the adult population, Race seems not to influence 
the PK of EVG, COBI, TAF or TFV. 
Baseline WT was included as a covariate on apparent clearance and volume of distribution in the final PopPK 
models for EVG, COBI, TAF, and TFV. Consistent with the identified WT effect, exposures for EVG, COBI, TAF, 
and TFV were found to increase at decreasing WT. The applicant was asked to discuss if the subjects in Q1 are 
in increased risk due to higher exposure. The applicant performed the required analysis, focusing in particular 
on the lower bound of the weight classes. This analysis was preceded by the update of the poppk models for 
TAF and COBI, by including additional subjects and improved description of the absorption phase and IIV on 
the  models.  These  changes  improved  significantly  the  performance  of  the  models  when  compared  to  the 
previous versions (as seen by the parameters estimates, GOF and VPCs). 
In  general,  and  as  expected,  patients  from  the  lower  weight  bounds  result  in  higher  exposures  (AUC)  and 
especially higher Cmax for all drugs. However, these results are usually inside the range of values observed 
for adults. Reducing the dose in these weight bands appears not to be possible as it could result in an increased 
number of patients with Ctau bellow the observed in adults, resulting in a potential loss of efficacy.  
Age and weight are confounding factors. Age was not identified as a statistically significant covariate for EVG, 
COBI, TAF, or TFV in their respective final PopPK model.

Due  to  the  inability  for  presenting  a  QSP  approach  able  to  serve  as  a  useful  predictor  of  bone  remodelling 
effects  and  of  BMD  changes  when  considered  for  both  TAF  25  mg  QD  and  TDF  300  mg  QD  administration, 
empirical regression models were alternatively explored concluding for the safety profile for TAF (boosted and 
unboosted) versus TDF in the paediatric population and supported the weight-band-based dosing regimen for 
both boosted- and unboosted-TAF in the paediatric population.

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
 Main study 
A  Phase  2/3,  Open-Label  Study  of  the  Pharmacokinetics,  Safety,  and  Antiviral  Activity  of  the 
Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir  Alafenamide  (E/C/F/TAF)  Single  Tablet  Regimen 
(STR) in HIV-1 Infected Antiretroviral Treatment-Naïve Adolescents and Virologically Suppressed 
Children 
Methods 
Study GS-US-292-0106 is a Phase 2/3 study initially designed to characterize the PK and confirm the dose of 
the adult GEN tablet (E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg) in ART-naïve, HIV-1 infected adolescents ≥ 12 to < 18 
years of age (Cohort 1) and virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age weighing 
≥ 25 kg (Cohort 2). The study was extended in Protocol Amendment 4 to characterize the PK and confirm the 
dose of a low-dose (LD) GEN tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) in virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected 
children ≥ 2  years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25  kg enrolled in an additional cohort, Cohort 3. The safety, 
tolerability, and antiviral activity of the adult and LD GEN tablets were also evaluated in the cohorts to which 
they were administered. 
The submitted data described the results of the study for subjects in Cohort 3 as determined by an interim 
analysis performed when all subjects in this cohort had completed their Week 48 visit. 
Study Participants 
Cohort 3 included virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected children ≥ 2 years of age, with a screening weight 
≥ 14 to < 25 kg, with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 consecutive months prior to screening, 
on  a  stable  antiretroviral  regimen  (ie,  stable  for  ≥  6  months,  or  newly  initiated  within  6  months  prior  to 
screening for a reason other than virologic failure) without documented history of resistance to any component 
of GEN.  
Subjects were enrolled at 9 sites in 5 countries: 3 in South Africa, 1 in Thailand, 1 in Uganda, 3 in the US, and 
1 in Zimbabwe. 
A total enrolment of up to 25 subjects was planned for Cohort 3, all of whom were to participate in an intensive 
PK evaluation at Week 2, following which subjects would continue to receive study drug and return for scheduled 
study visits through Week 48.

Treatments 
Subjects received one low-dose FDC tablet daily, orally with food, at approximately the same time each day. 
Subjects were instructed to take their tablet with food at the same time each morning (with breakfast) during 
the  days  leading  up  to  intensive  PK  assessments  at  the  Week  2  visit.  On  the  day  of  the  intensive  PK  visit, 
subjects were administered the study drug dose, with food, in the clinic, after an overnight fast of at least 8 
hours. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives for cohort 3 were: 
−  To  evaluate  the  PK  of  EVG  and  TAF  and  confirm  the  dose  of  the  STR  in  virologically  suppressed  HIV-1 
infected  children  ≥  2  years  of  age  weighing  ≥  14  to  <  25  kg  administered  E/C/F/TAF  low  dose  (LD) 
(90/90/120/6 mg) STR 
−  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of E/C/F/TAF LD STR through Week 24 in virologically suppressed 
HIV-1 infected children ≥ 2 years of age and weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg 
The secondary objectives for cohort 3 were: 
−  To  evaluate  the  antiviral  activity  of  switching  to  E/C/F/TAF  LD  STR  through  Week  48  in  virologically 
suppressed HIV-1 infected children ≥ 2 years of age and weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg 
−  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of E/C/F/TAF LD STR through Week 48 in virologically suppressed 
HIV-1 infected children ≥ 2 years of age and weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg 
The exploratory objective of this study for all cohorts (1, 2 and 3) was to explore the PK of TFV-DP in PBMCs 
following administration of E/C/F/TAF STR in Cohort 1 and 2, or E/C/F/TAF LD STR in Cohort 3. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoints for cohort 3 were: 
−  The PK parameter AUCtau for EVG and TAF 
−  The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  and  all  treatment-emergent  AEs 
through Week 24 
The secondary endpoints for cohort 3 were: 
−  The percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 as defined by the 
US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm 
−  The change from baseline in CD4 cell count (cells/μL) and percentage at Weeks 24 and 48 
−  The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 (missing = failure [M = 
F] and missing = excluded [M = E] analyses) 
−  The incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs and all treatment-emergent AEs through Week 48 
−  The PK parameters Ctau, Cmax, apparent CL/F, and apparent Vz/F for EVG; Cmax, apparent CL/F, and apparent 
Vz/F for TAF; and AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau for FTC, tenofovir (TFV), and COBI

The 25 subjects planned for intensive PK evaluation in Cohort 3 is deemed sufficient for the evaluation of safety 
due to the large number of subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 combined who have contributed to the safety profile of 
GEN at exposures predicted to be similar to those of Cohort 3. The number of included subjects was calculated 
to provide adequate power to conclude exposure equivalence between children and adults when compared to 
historical adult data. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Study GS-US-292-0106 is a non-randomized open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses used the FAS, which included all subjects who were enrolled into the study and received at 
least 1 dose of study drug.   
The proportions of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 were evaluated using 
both the US FDA defined snapshot algorithm and M = F and M = E analyses. The 95% CIs for these percentages 
were constructed using the Clopper-Pearson Exact method.  
All safety analyses were performed using the safety analysis set.

The Interim Analysis 6 data-cut date occurred when all subjects had completed their Week 48 visit. Immediately 
prior to that point, 33.3% (9 of 27) of treated subjects were receiving study drug in the main phase of the 
study (i.e. 48 weeks), and 66.7% (18 of 27) of subjects were receiving study drug in the extension phase of 
the study. No subject in either the main or the extension phase of the study prematurely discontinued either 
study drug or the study. 
Recruitment 
The first subject was screened for cohort 3 on 12 December 2018. The Last Subject Last Visit for the primary 
endpoint occurred on 11 May 2020. The evaluation of subjects continued through 6 October 2020 (Last 
Subject Last Visit for the fifth Interim Report).

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol (4 February 2013) was amended 6 times (22 March 2013, 09 January 2015, 11 August 
2016, 11 June 2018, 17 August 2018, and 21 February 2020). Cohort 3 was introduced into the protocol at 
Protocol Amendment 4, dated 11 June 2018. All subjects in Cohort 3 were enrolled under Protocol 
Amendment 5 or the South Africa-specific Protocol Amendment 5.1, both dated 17 August 2018; the two 
amendments are identical, and a South Africa-specific protocol was required only because the study is 
considered to be Phase 1/2 in that country, rather than Phase 2/3 as in the other participating countries. In 
Protocol Amendment 5, the inclusion criteria were updated to require a CD4 cell count ≥ 400 cells/μL for 
potential subjects (previously > 100 cells/μL). 
Sensitivity analyses were performed in respect of the main efficacy endpoint (percentage of subjects with 
HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 as defined by the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm) and 
palatability/acceptability assessments, in which subjects who switched from the LD tablet to the adult GEN 
tablet (E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg) by virtue of having attained a weight ≥ 25 kg during the main phase 
of the study were excluded from the FAS and Safety Analysis Set, respectively, at the appropriate time 
points. 
A total of 35 important protocol deviations were reported for 19 subjects in Cohort 3 during the study 
through the data-cut date. Of the 19 subjects, 9 subjects had a single important deviation, 4 subjects had 2 
important deviations, and 6 subjects had 3 important deviations. The most common important protocol 
deviations (30 of 35) were in connection with missing data at the Week 24 and/or Week 48 visits.  
A total of 25 important protocol deviations related to COVID-19 were reported for 17 subjects. The most 
common important protocol deviations (24 of 25) were in connection with missing data at the Week 24 
and/or Week 48 visits. 
According to the MAH, none of these important protocol deviations affected the overall quality or 
interpretation of the study data. 
Adherence to study drug was based on pill count. 
The median rates of adherence to study drug up to the Week 24 and Week 48 visits, and up to the data-cut 
date, were 98.2%, 98.5%, and 98.6%, respectively. The percentage of subjects with an adherence rate ≥ 
95% was 85.2% up to the Week 24 visit, 88.9% up to the Week 48 visit, and 92.6% up to the data-cut date.  
Adherence to LD E/C/F/TAF was good, with more than 23 out of the 27 subjects with adherence ≥ 95% and 
no subject with adherence <80%.

The entry criteria described in the protocol were followed to include virologically suppressed children without 
advanced disease. The relevance of the efficacy results to other populations (ARV-naïve with advanced disease) 
is still unknown.

Numbers analysed 
All 27 enrolled subjects, who each received at least 1 dose of study drug, were included in each of the specified 
analysis sets (Safety, Full, DXA [Spine and TBLH], Intensive PK [all analytes], and PK [all analytes]). Even if 
limited, all subjects enrolled were included in the analyses that were made. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Percentage of Subjects with Plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 Copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 Using the US FDA-
Defined Snapshot Algorithm 
At baseline, all Cohort 3 subjects (27 of 27) had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. 
At both Week 24 and Week 48, 96.3% (26 of 27) of subjects in the FAS had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, using 
the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm. 
Sensitivity analyses in which subjects who had switched from the LD to the adult GEN tablet by virtue of having 
attained a weight ≥ 25 kg as the study progressed were excluded from the FAS demonstrated a similarly high 
maintenance of virological suppression. Percentages of subjects receiving the GEN LD tablet at the Week 24 
and 48 time points with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL were as follows: Week 24: 96.2% (25 of 26 subjects); 
Week 48, 95.8% (23 of 24 subjects). 
One subject who remained on the LD tablet through the data-cut date, had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at both 
Week 24 and Week 48. This subject had previously had HIV-1 RNA levels < 20 copies/mL through Week 16, 
and again at Weeks 32 and 60. Values were > 50 copies/mL at Weeks 20, 40, and 48 in a rather erratic fashion, 
possibly reflecting inconsistent study drug adherence. 
Change from Baseline in CD4 Cell Count (Cells/μL) at Weeks 24 and 48 
Twenty-five of the 27 enrolled subjects in Cohort 3 had a CD4 cell count ≥ 500 cells/μL at baseline; 2 
subjects had a CD4 cell count in the category 350 to ≤ 499 cells/μL). 
A change from baseline in mean CD4 cell count was observed at Week 2 (the first available time point) 
following which the mean value appeared stable through Week 48. 
Mean (SD) and median (Q1, Q3) values for baseline CD4 cell count (FAS; based on observed data) were 
1153 (459.9) and 1061 (895, 1315) cells/μL, respectively (Section 15.1, Table 12). Mean and median 
changes from baseline in CD4 cell count were as follows: 
•  At Week 24: Mean (SD) −137 (278.3) cells/μL; median (Q1, Q3) −63 (−190, −3) cells/μL 
•  At Week 48: Mean (SD) −179 (319.2) cells/μL; median (Q1, Q3) −187 (−370, 44) cells/μL 
The 2 subjects with baseline CD4 cell counts in this category, aged 7 and 9 years, with baseline CD4 cell 
count values of 446 and 383 cells/μL, respectively, both had a CD4 cell count ≥ 500 at both Week 24 and 
Week 48. 
Change from Baseline in CD4 Percentage 
Mean CD4% values for subjects in Cohort 3 remained stable through Week 48. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 53/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mean (SD) and median (Q1, Q3) values for baseline CD4% (FAS) were 35.9% (6.73%) and 37.4% (30.6%, 
40.3%), respectively. 
Mean and median changes from baseline in CD4 cell count were as follows: 
•  At Week 24: Mean (SD) 0.0% (4.40%); median (Q1, Q3) −0.1% (−3.1%, 3.5%) 
•  At Week 48: Mean (SD) 0.2% (3.78%); median (Q1, Q3) 0.4% (−2.0%, 2.8%) 
Percentage of Subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 Copies/mL (M = F and M = E) Analyses 
Percentages of subjects in Cohort 3 with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 and Week 48 as determined 
using M = F and M = E methods were as follows: 
•  M = F: Week 24, 96.3% (26 of 27 subjects); Week 48, 96.3% (26 of 27 subjects) 
•  M = E: Week 24, 96.3% (26 of 27 subjects); Week 48, 96.3% (26 of 27 subjects) 
The subject with HIV-1 RNA > 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 had levels < 20 copies/mL through Week 16 
and at Weeks 32 and 60.  
Based on efficacy analyses at Week 24 and Week 48 using the USFDA defined snapshot algorithm, the rates 
of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) were maintained in the analysed population of 
virologically suppressed children. There were no clinically relevant changes in CD4 cell counts and CD4%.  
Virology Resistance Analyses 
Of the 27 subjects in Cohort 3 receiving the GEN LD tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) through Week 48, 1 
subject (3.7%) met the virologic failure criteria and qualified for viral resistance testing. No resistance to study 
drug was detected and the subject remained on study drug, subsequently resuppressing HIV-1 RNA to < 50 
copies/mL.  
No subjects developed treatment-emergent drug resistance substitutions in integrase or reverse transcriptase. 
Ancillary analyses 
No subgroup analysis were performed.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To  support  the  current  line  extension/variation,  the  applicant  has  submitted,  as  interim  report,  the  data 
obtained  from  one  ongoing  study  (GS-US-292-0106)  that  evaluated  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy  data  of  LD 
E/C/F/TAF in paediatric patients aged ≥ 2 years weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg.  
A total of 27 subjects were included. Eligible subjects were virologically suppressed HIV-1 subjects aged ≥ 2 
years weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg on a stable antiretroviral regimen for ≥ 6 months prior to screening; HIV-1 
RNA  <  50  copies/mL  at  screening;  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  (eGFR)  ≥  90 mL/min/1.73  m2  (as 
calculated using the Schwartz formula; eGFRSchwartz); and adequate hematologic and hepatic function.  
The CHMP considered the design and conduct of the study GS-US-292-0106 appropriate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  virologic  response  rate,  defined  as  the  number and  percentage  of  subjects  with  plasma  viral load  < 50 
HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at Week 48 (per FDA Snapshot approach, FAS population) was 96.3% (26/27) in Cohort 
3. The results were consistent with M=F and M=E analysis.  
Sensitivity analyses in which subjects who had switched from the LD to the adult GEN tablet by virtue of having 
attained a weight ≥ 25 kg as the study progressed were excluded from the FAS demonstrated a similarly high 
maintenance of virological suppression. Percentages of subjects receiving the GEN LD tablet at the Week 24

and 48 time points with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL were as follows: Week 24: 96.2% (25 of 26 subjects); 
Week 48, 95.8% (23 of 24 subjects). 
One subject (3.7%) met the virologic failure criteria and qualified for viral resistance testing. No resistance to 
study drug was detected and the subject remained on study drug, subsequently resuppressing HIV-1 RNA to 
< 50 copies/mL. 
In this virologically suppressed paediatric study population with high baseline mean CD4 cell count and CD4%, 
there were no clinically relevant changes from Baseline in CD4 cell counts and CD4% for Cohort 3. 
The efficacy data were not the primary endpoints, but they were considered supportive by the CHMP. The study 
design  and  the  limited  population  of  virologically  suppressed  children  could  limit  the  extrapolation  of  these 
results to other populations (e.g. ARV-naïve subjects or with high viral load). 
Almost all (26) of the 27 subjects maintained virological suppression at Week 48. One subject had detectable 
HIV-1 RNA at Weeks 24 and 48, but he had undetectable viral load between these weeks and at Week 60. No 
Genvoya-related resistance associated mutations were identified.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  efficacy  data  support  the  lower  dose  of  Genvoya  in  the  extended  paediatric 
population (patients aged ≥ 2 years weighing ≥ 14 kg). 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The MAH submitted the safety data of LD EVG/C/F/TAF in HIV-1-infected, virologically suppressed paediatric 
subjects ≥ 2 years weighing ≥ 14 kg and < 25 kg participating in Cohort 3 of Study GS-US-292-0106. 
The  safety  data  from  Cohort  3  provides  additional data  on the  safety  profile of  Genvoya  in  a  new  low-dose 
tablet. 
 Patient exposure 
All 27 paediatric subjects ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg received at least 1 dose of study drug. At 
the data-cut date, the median (Q1, Q3) exposure to the GEN LD tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) was 48.3 
(48.0, 60.1) weeks, and 77.8% (21 of 27) subjects had received E/C/F/TAF for ≥ 48 weeks. 
 Adverse events 
Safety is reported on a cumulative basis and the Safety Analysis Set includes 3 subjects who switched to the 
adult GEN tablet (E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg) having attained a weight > 25 kg during the main phase of 
the study, 1 at Week 12, 2 at Week 32). The overall summary of adverse events is presented in tables 21 and 
22. 
74.1% (20 of 27) of subjects had at least 1 AE, the majority of which were Grade 1 (mild) in severity and not 
considered  related  to  study  drug.  No  subject  had  a  Grade  3  or  4  AE,  or  an  AE  leading  to  premature

discontinuation of study drug. One subject had an SAE, which was not considered related to study drug. There 
was no treatment emergent death. 
Two  subjects  had  a  Stage  3,  HIV-1  related  opportunistic  illness,  neither of  which  was  considered  related  to 
study drug. 
No subject experienced an AE for COVID-19 or a suspected COVID-19 infection. 
The most commonly reported AEs were as follows: 
•  Upper respiratory tract infection (29.6%, 8 subjects) 
•  Cough (18.5%, 5 subjects) 
•  Decreased appetite and vomiting (each 14.8%, 4 subjects)

paediatric population. 
 Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No treatment-emergent death was reported through the data cut date. 
Serious adverse events 
Pneumonia, considered not related to study drug, and not leading to premature discontinuation of study drug, 
was reported as an SAE for 1 subject through the data-cut date. 
Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
Adverse  events  related  to  study  drug  were  reported  for  4  subjects  (14.8%).  Study  drug-related  AEs  that 
occurred in > 1 subject were diarrhoea and vomiting, each of which was reported for 2 subjects.  
Other events 
As  for  other  trials  assessing  cobicistat  and  tenofovir-containing  FDCs  particular  attention  was  paid  to  bone 
safety and renal safety. 
Bone safety 
Fracture Events 
Fracture events were assessed in this study because of the importance of bone safety in a paediatric population 
accruing bone mass. No fractures were reported.

Spine 
Mean (SD) increases from baseline of 3.094% (4.7951%) and 5.275% (5.7970%) in spine BMD were observed 
at Weeks 24 and 48, respectively. 
Total Body Less Head 
Mean (SD) increases from baseline of 3.816% (3.3616%) and 7.160% (4.1588%) in TBLH BMD were observed 
at Weeks 24 and 48, respectively. 
The percentages of subjects with ≥ 4% decrease from baseline at Week 24 or Week 48 in spine or TBLH BMD 
were: 
•  Spine: Week 24, 2 of 27 subjects (7.4%); Week 48, 1 of 27 subjects (3.7%) 
• 
TBLH: Week 24, 1 of 27 subjects (3.7%); Week 48, 0 of 27 subjects (0.0%) 
One  subject  had  percentage  decreases  ≥  4%  from  baseline  in  both  spine  (Week  24,  −7.544%;  Week  48, 
−6.805%) and TBLH BMD (Week 24, −4.354%). Height-age spine BMD Z-scores at baseline, Week 24, and 
Week 48 for this subject were 1.54, 0.72, and 0.71, respectively; the corresponding height-age TBLH BMD Z-
scores were 0.84, 0.06, and 0.18. A second subject had a percentage decrease ≥ 4% from baseline in spine 
BMD  at  Week  24  (−5.451%).  Height-age  spine  BMD  Z-scores  at  baseline,  Week  24,  and  Week  48  for  this 
subject were −0.97, −1.39, and −1.19, respectively; the corresponding height-age TBLH BMD Z-scores were 
−0.83, −1.19, and −0.98. 
Change from Baseline in Bone Mineral Density Z-Scores 
BMD status was also assessed using BMD Z-scores. Z-scores are the measurement of choice to interpret BMD 
outcomes in paediatric populations. The Z-score for any BMD value is the number of SDs that value lies below 
or above the mean BMD of an age, sex, and race matched control group, and is therefore more informative 
than  an  absolute  BMD  value  or  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  BMD.  A  Z-score  ≤  −2.0  is  “below  the 
expected range for age” and is considered to reflect a low bone mineral mass or BMD, while a Z-score > −2.0 
is within the expected range for age. 
Spine 
Baseline spine standard and height-age BMD Z-scores and changes from baseline in each at Weeks 24 and 48 
are shown in the below Table 23.

Spine and Total-Body-Less-Head Clinical Status 
Clinical BMD status was assessed using height-age BMD Z-scores. A height-age BMD Z-score that changes from 
> −2 at baseline to ≤ 2 has been used as a means to identify possible significant bone loss as this is considered 
a  “low-for-age”  outcome.  The  diagnosis  of  osteoporosis  in  children  is  appropriate  only  when  both  low  bone 
mass (BMD Z-score ≤ −2) and a clinically significant fracture history are present. 
No subject showed a worsening (change from > −2 to ≤ −2) from baseline in spine height-age BMD Z-score 
at Week 24 or 48. 
Two subjects showed a worsening from baseline in TBLH height-age BMD Z-score at Week 48. Neither subject 
had a clinically significant fracture history. 
Median (Q1, Q3) baseline values and percentage changes from baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 for serum levels 
of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D, and 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D are presented in the 
below table 25. Changes in levels of each between baseline and Week 48 are not considered clinically relevant.

parameters at weeks 24 and 48 (Safety analysis set, cohort 3) 
The bone safety parameters assessed did not show any new safety concern with only two subjects showing a 
worsening from baseline in TBLH height-age BMD Z-score at Week 48. 
Renal Safety 
Renal Events 
Renal safety was of interest for this study because renal toxicity has been associated with TFV, and because 
COBI inhibits tubular secretion of creatinine, leading to an increase in serum creatinine and a decrease in eGFR, 
without an effect on actual glomerular filtration in adults. There were no AEs of renal tubulopathy (including 
Fanconi syndrome), and no renal AEs that led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Renal Laboratory Parameters 
Serum Creatinine 
Median (Q1, Q3) baseline serum creatinine was 0.44 (0.38, 0.49) mg/dL. Values remained stable through Week 
48. Median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 were as follows: 
•  Week 24: 0.00 (−0.05, 0.04) mg/dL 
•  Week 48: −0.01 (−0.04, 0.04) mg/dL 
No graded serum creatinine abnormality was reported. 
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate

EMA/682126/2022 
Page 62/88 
 
 
 
Median  (Q1,  Q3)  baseline eGFR  using the  Schwartz formula  was  147.0  (139.1,  159.1)  mL/min/1.73 m2.  An 
increase from baseline was observed at Week 1 that remained relatively stable through Week 48. Median (Q1, 
Q3) changes from baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 were as follows: 
•  Week 24: 4.1 (−13.8, 26.8) mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Week 48: 9.6 (−11.2, 19.3) mL/min/1.73 m2 
Phosphorus 
Median  serum  phosphorus  values  were  within  the normal  reference  range  throughout  the  study.  No  graded 
abnormalities of serum phosphorus were reported. 
Glycosuria 
No graded abnormalities in urine glucose were reported. 
Treatment-Emergent Proteinuria by Urinalysis (Dipstick) 
At  baseline,  2  subjects  (7.4%)  had  Grade  1  proteinuria  as  assessed  by  dipstick  analysis.  Postbaseline, 
treatment-emergent proteinuria (Grade 1) was reported for 6 subjects (22.2%). No obvious correlation was 
observed between these instances of proteinuria and any other renal laboratory abnormality. 
Proteinuria by Quantitative Assessment 
The UPCR was ≤ 200 mg/g (and urinary protein < 4.0 mg/dL) for all subjects at baseline and at all subsequent 
time points (Weeks 8, 12, 24, and 48). 
Urine Retinol Binding Protein to Creatinine Ratio and Beta-2 Microglobulin to Creatinine Ratio 
The median (Q1, Q3) baseline urine RBP to creatinine ratio was 122.1 (68.4, 138.3) μg/g. A variable decrease 
in the urine RBP to creatinine ratio was observed at Week 8 (the first time point) and maintained through Week 
48. Median (Q1, Q3) percentage changes from baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 were as follows: 
•  Week 24: −15.7% (−31.0%, 9.6%) 
•  Week 48: −21.9% (−41.3%, 41.7%) 
The  median  (Q1,  Q3)  baseline  urine  beta-2  microglobulin  to  creatinine  ratio  was  158.8  (106.3,  190.3).  A 
variable decrease in the urine beta-2 microglobulin to creatinine ratio was observed at Week 8 (the first time 
point) and maintained through Week 48. Median (Q1, Q3) percentage changes from baseline at Weeks 24 and 
48 were as follows: 
•  Week 24: −24.4% (−68.1%, 34.3%) 
•  Week 48: −26.6% (−43.4%, −0.9%) 
No  notable  change  in  renal  safety  parameters  was  noted  through  week  48  in  this  virologically  suppressed 
paediatric population. 
 Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline for median values of haematology or clinical chemistry 
at Weeks 24 or 48. Median values were within the relevant reference ranges.

Most subjects (92.6%; 25 of 27) had at least 1 graded laboratory abnormality during the study through the 
data-cut date; for 24 of these 25 subjects the maximum toxicity was Grade 1 or 2. One subject, with a platelet 
count within the normal reference range at baseline, had a Grade 3 decrease in platelets at Week 24, which 
persisted at a lesser toxicity grade through Week 60. This was reported as a Grade 1 AE (thrombocytopenia) 
considered not related to study drug, ongoing at the data-cut date. 
No subject met Hy’s Law criteria, defined as concurrent increases in AST or ALT > 3 × ULN and total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN with alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN and no alternative aetiology. 
Median  (Q1,  Q3)  change  from  baseline  in  fasting  glucose  and  lipid  parameters  at  Weeks  24  and  48  are 
presented in the below Table 26.

(hyperglycaemia, 3.7%, 1 of 27 subjects). All graded fasting lipid and glucose abnormalities were Grade 1 (the 
majority) or Grade 2. 
Vital signs 
There have been no clinically relevant changes in any vital signs parameter reported in any subject in Cohort 
3. 
Tanner Stage 
Tanner stages for genitalia in males and breasts in females at baseline and Weeks 24 and 48 were consistent 
with the paediatric study population ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg. 
Body Weight 
At baseline, the median (Q1, Q3) body weight was 19.3 (17.0, 20.5) kg, and the median (Q1, Q3) Z-score for 
weight was −0.88 (−1.72, −0.32). 
There were no notable changes in body weight Z-score during the study. Changes in body weight Z-scores at 
Weeks 24 and 48 were as follows: 
•  Week 24: Mean (SD) 0.05 (0.269); median (Q1, Q3) 0.04 (−0.17, 0.28) 
•  Week 48: Mean (SD) 0.21 (0.313); median (Q1, Q3) 0.24 (0.01, 0.46) 
Height 
At baseline, the median (Q1, Q3) body height was 116.1 (106.0, 123.0) cm, and the median (Q1, Q3) Z-score 
for height was −0.28, (−1.42, 0.23). 
There were no notable changes in body height Z-score during the study. Changes in body height Z-scores at 
Weeks 24 and 48 were as follows: 
•  Week 24: Mean (SD) −0.06 (0.379); median (Q1, Q3) −0.10 (−0.32, 0.23) 
•  Week 48: Mean (SD) 0.03 (0.558); median (Q1, Q3) 0.00 (−0.41, 0.33) 
 Safety in special populations 
Palatability and Acceptability Assessments 
Palatability  and  acceptability  were  assessed  to  confirm  the  appropriateness  of  the  LD  Genvoya  tablets. 
Responses from subjects who had switched to the adult GEN tablet (E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg) having 
attained a weight ≥ 25 kg (1 subject at Week 12; 2 subjects at Week 32) are excluded from assessments at 
Week 24 and/or Week 48, as applicable. 
The majority of Cohort 3 subjects (≥ 2 years of age and weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg) had a neutral (“maybe 
good or maybe bad/could not taste it”) or positive (“good” or “super good”) palatability response to the GEN 
LD  tablet  (E/C/F/TAF  90/90/120/6  mg)  at  baseline  (92.6%,  25  of  27  subjects),  Week  24  (93.8%,  15  of  16 
subjects), and Week 48 (91.7%, 22 of 24 subjects). 
The majority of Cohort 3 subjects had a neutral or positive acceptability response at baseline and Weeks 24 
and 48 for ease of swallowing, shape, and size of the GEN LD tablet when the tablet was swallowed whole. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 65/88 
 
 
 
There were some concerns on the acceptability of the tablet considering its size.  
Overall the tablet was well taken and tolerated by all patients, irrespective of the age (some with the splitting 
of the tablet). Interestingly, with time, patients (even the younger ones) developed skills to take the whole 
tablet. 
Data  regarding  acceptability  of  a  similar  size  tablet  of  Biktarvy  (B/F/TAF)  also  pointed  to  its  tolerability  in 
children ≥ 2 years of age and weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg. 
A score line was added to the tablet to facilitate the process of splitting. On all occasions when the LDT was 
taken split, both halves were taken within 10 minutes. The information regarding the possibility to split the 
tablet is already included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. The SmPC has been updated to provide guidance that if 
the tablet is split both halves should be taken immediately. 
Palatability was also assessed with a good or at least neutral response being reported by the vast majority of 
the patients. The data presented by the MAH regarding the acceptability/palatability studies for the younger 
paediatric  population  (new  indication  is  for  ≥ 2  years  old,  ≥ 14  kg)  is  acknowledged.    The  MAH  does  not 
recommend tablet chewing or crushing and mixing with food/liquids, mainly due to the poor palatability profile 
of TAF, as well as an anticipated lower TAF exposure following crushing of Genvoya LDT. Therefore, splitting 
the tablet in half is recommended as reflected in section 4.2 of the proposed SmPC. 
Summary of long-term safety and efficacy in HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 
Previous interim clinical study reports (CSRs) describing results for adolescents and children in Cohorts 1 and 
2 receiving the adult-strength GEN tablet have included safety, efficacy, and PK data for all subjects in Cohort 
1 through at least 96 weeks of treatment, and for Cohort 2 subjects through at least 96 weeks (subjects in 
Cohort 2 Part A) or 48 weeks (subjects in Cohort 2 Part B) of treatment. 
The MAH submitted a long-term safety report that describes safety (with a particular focus on bone and renal 
safety) and efficacy results for adolescent and child subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 receiving the adult-strength 
GEN  tablet  through  median  (Q1,  Q3)  exposures  of  312.1  (132.7,  336.0)  and  168.1  (156.4,  251.9)  weeks, 
respectively. 
Safety evaluation 
Adverse events 
Cohort 1 (≥ 12 to < 18 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 35 kg) 
Most subjects (96.0%, 48 of 50 subjects) had at least 1 AE. The majority of AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity;

Bone safety and Growth parameters  
Fracture Events 
In cohort 1, traumatic fracture events were reported for 2 subjects: a Grade 2 AE of hand fracture in 1 subject 
and Grade 3 SAEs of radius fracture and ulna fracture in 1 subject. No fracture was considered related to study 
drug. 
In cohort 2 traumatic fracture events were reported for 3 subjects. Individual events of radius fracture, foot 
fracture, and hand fracture were reported. All were reported as Grade 1 AEs unrelated to study drug. 
Bone Mineral Density 
Percentage Change from Baseline in Spine and Total-Body-Less-Head Bone Mineral Density 
Cohort 1 (≥ 12 to < 18 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 35 kg) 
Overall,  spine  and  TBLH  BMD  increased  relative  to  baseline  through  Week  336.  At  Weeks  96  and  288, 
respectively, mean (SD) percentage increases in spine BMD were 9.082% (8.3758%) and 31.823% (20.532%), 
and mean (SD) percentage increases in TBLH BMD were 3.552% (4.8549%) and 11.717% (8.9851%). 
Spine 
Overall, 5 of 47 subjects had a ≥ 4% decrease from baseline in spine BMD at some time point, 4 subjects at 
one time point and one at 2 time points (Section 8.1, Listing req13011.14). In only 1 subject was the ≥ 4% 
decrease in spine BMD accompanied by a shift in HA BMD Z-score from > −2 to ≤ −2. 
TBLH 
One subject had a ≥ 4% decrease in TBLH BMD, at Week 144, which was not accompanied by a shift in HA 
BMD Z-score from > −2 to ≤ −2. 
Cohort 2 (≥ 6 to < 12 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 25 kg) 
Overall,  spine  and  TBLH  BMD  increased  relative  to  baseline  through  Week  240.  At  Weeks  96  and  192, 
respectively,  mean  (SD)  percentage  increases  in  spine  BMD  were  9.532%  (10.8790%)  and  28.041% 
(15.6760%),  and  mean  (SD)  percentage  increases  in  TBLH  BMD  were  8.458%  (6.6464%)  and  18.073% 
(9.3998%). 
Spine

Page 67/88 
 
 
Overall, 10 of 50 subjects (20%) had a ≥ 4% decrease from baseline in spine BMD at some time point. For 2 
subjects such a decrease was noted only at Week 24. For the remaining 8 subjects, all enrolled at a single site, 
decreases ≥ 4% were generally observed at more than one time point. With 2 isolated and transient exceptions 
(HA BMD Z-scores of −2.01 and −2.48), these ≥ 4% decreases in spine BMD were not accompanied by a shift 
from > −2 to ≤ −2 in spine HA-BMD Z-score. 
TBLH 
Overall, 4 of 52 subjects (7.7%), all from the single site referred to above, had a ≥ 4% decrease from baseline 
in TBLH BMD at some time point. For 2 subjects the ≥ 4% decrease was noted only at Week 24, while for the 
remaining 2  subjects,  decreases  ≥  4%  were  observed  at  more  than one  time  point.  With  a  single  transient 
exception (HA BMD Z-score of −2.06) the ≥ 4% decreases in TBLH BMD were not accompanied by a shift from 
> −2 to ≤ −2 in TBLH HA BMD Z-score.

From the provided long term bone safety data in 50 children aged 6-12 followed for up to 240 weeks there 
seems to be some loss of bone mineral density compared to baseline, which may be interpreted as progressive. 
The MAH  was asked to discuss the post baseline Z score development for bone mineral density in the 6-12 
years old along with the methodological strength on evidence that there is a loss of BMD secondary to starting 
Genvoya, as well as what would be the clinical implications of the measured value: 
Bone Safety 
Exposure to TAF regimen in children aged 6 to 12 years resulted in a ≥ 4% decrease in spine BMD at one or 
more  timepoints  in  10  of  50  exposed  patients  but  this  was  reversed  throughout  the  subsequent  timepoint 
assessments up to Week 240 in most of them. The applicant argues that this early BMD decrease results from 
the fact that patients have rich in metabolically active trabecular bone that would mostly be affected in the first 
weeks of exposure.  Nine (9) participants experienced a shift (5 in spine and 7 in TBLH) in HA BMD Z-score 
from > −2 to ≤ −2 at any visit; 3 of these 9 participants shifted back to a Z-score > −2 at subsequent visits. 
Among the other 6, 5 increased their BMD values in spine and TBLH, and increased or maintained a stable HA 
BMD Z-score compared with baseline, although failing to increase BMD as it would be expected with growth. 
One participant experienced a bone fracture (following traumatic event) that the applicant considers unrelated 
to the study drug but for which we cannot for sure exclude causality (how would the bone behave if with normal 
mineralization?). PK assessments did not correlate TAF exposure to impact on BMD (maximum peak exposure 
does not correlate to higher impact on MBD). 
For children aged 2 to 6 years old, despite the smaller sample size (n = 27) and shorter follow-up (only up to 
Week 48) the rate of mineralization was as expected for this age group, with spine HA BMD Z-scores improving 
from baseline (as expected with growth). Two participants (1 in spine and 1 in both spine and TBLH) showed 
a ≥ 4% decrease in BMD without a shift in spine HA BMD Z-score from > −2 to ≤ −2. Two further participants 
showed a shift in TBLH HA BMD Z-score from > −2 to ≤ −2 at Week 48 without a decrease in their absolute 
TBLH BMD. Height and weight Z-scores were stable or improved, and no participant experienced a bone-related 
AE. Longer exposure times are not expected to further affect bone mineral density as per results of patients 
treated with TDF-containing regimens, and considering also the stability/improvement seen in older cohorts 
following exposure to TAF-regiments. 
The  changes  in  BMD  did not  correlate  with  clinical  outcomes  (for  fractures,  apart  from  the  above  described 
case) nor biomarkers of bone formation or resorption.  
Compared to TDF-containing regimens, patients exposed to TAF had lower impact on Bone mineralization as 
measured by DXA. A discussion on the lower PK exposures to TFV following TAF  Vs TDF  (where long terms 
outcomes are available), is also used to point to the long term safety profile of TAF containing regimens. 
The  MAH  also  presented  data  pointing  to  the  benefit  on  BMD  of  the  change  from  TDF-to  TAF-containing 
regimens in adults that he believes would be similar for the paediatric population. 
In conclusion, the concerns about the impact of TAF containing regiments on bone mineralization are considered 
to be addressed in children aged 6-<12 years old. The lack of longer follow-up period for the younger subset 
(2-<6 years of age) seems to be the most challenging aspect when looking at the available data. The MAH has 
addressed this topic by discussing the impact on bone mineralization with time for the older patients that overall 
showed  a  normalization  of  even  improvement  of  BMD  with  longer  periods  of  exposure  to  TAF  containing 
regimens.

Spine and Total-Body-Less-Head Clinical Status 
Clinical BMD status was assessed using HA BMD Z-scores. 
Cohort 1 (≥ 12 to < 18 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 35 kg) 
No subject had a concurrent fracture history. 
A shift in spine BMD HA Z-score from > −2 at baseline to ≤ −2 at some time point post-baseline was observed 
for 3 subjects. A shift in TBLH BMD HA Z-score from > −2 at baseline to ≤ −2 at some time point post-baseline 
was observed for 3 subjects. 
Cohort 2 (≥ 6 to < 12 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 25 kg) 
No subject had a concurrent fracture history. 
A shift in spine BMD HA Z-score from > −2 at baseline to ≤ −2 post-baseline was observed for 5 subjects. A 
shift in TBLH BMD HA Z-score from > −2 at baseline to ≤ −2 post-baseline was observed for 7 subjects. 
Bone Laboratory Parameters 
No clinical relevance was derived from the changes in any of the bone biomarkers (serum levels of parameters 
of  bone  resorption  (collagen  type  I  N-and  C-terminal  telopeptides)  and  bone  formation  (osteocalcin,  bone-
specific alkaline phosphatase, procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide), parathyroid hormone, 25-OH vitamin 
D, and 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D) from baseline to 336 weeks. 
Renal Safety 
Renal Events 
Cohort 1 (≥ 12 to < 18 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 35 kg) 
There were no AEs of renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome). As previously reported on the Interim 
4 CSR, one subject with a prior history of urinary retention reported a Grade 2 SAE of urinary retention that 
resulted in hospitalization. The event was unrelated to study drug and resolved 6 days later. 
Cohort 2 (≥ 6 to < 12 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 25 kg) 
There were no AEs of renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome). One subject reported a Grade 3 SAE of 
acute glomerulonephritis that resulted in hospitalization; the event was unrelated to study drug and resolved 
30  days  later.  This  event  was  preceded  by  an  AE  of  pyrexia  and  was  reported  concurrently  with  an  SAE  of 
hypertension. 
Renal Laboratory Parameters 
Serum Creatinine 
Cohort 1 (≥ 12 to < 18 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 35 kg) 
Median (Q1, Q3) baseline serum creatinine was 0.58 (0.50, 0.79) mg/dL. A gradual increase from baseline was 
observed from Week 1 that continued through at least Week 336. Median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline at 
Weeks 48, 96, 192, 288, and 336 were as follows: 
•  Week 48 (N = 48): 0.07 (0.02, 0.15) mg/dL 
•  Week 96 (N = 46): 0.10 (0.05, 0.15) mg/dL 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 72/88 
 
 
•  Week 192 (N = 33): 0.13 (0.05, 0.24) mg/dL 
•  Week 288 (N = 31): 0.16 (0.11, 0.30) mg/dL 
•  Week 336 (N = 4): 0.28 (0.18, 0.33) mg/dL 
Absolute serum creatinine values remained within normal reference ranges, and the gradual increase seen over 
several years is consistent with the physiological changes accompanying growth in adolescents. 
No Grade 3 or 4 serum creatinine abnormalities were reported. 
Cohort 2 (≥ 6 to < 12 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 25 kg) 
Median (Q1, Q3) baseline serum creatinine was 0.51 (0.45, 0.55) mg/dL. A gradual increase from baseline was 
observed at Week 4 that continued through Week 228. Median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline at Weeks 48, 
96, 192, and 228 were as follows: 
•  Week 48 (N = 51): 0.03 (−0.01, 0.07) mg/dL 
•  Week 96 (N = 45): 0.08 (0.01, 0.13) mg/dL 
•  Week 192 (N = 19): 0.10 (0.05, 0.21) mg/dL 
•  Week 228 (N = 19): 0.10 (0.05, 0.22) mg/dL 
Absolute serum creatinine values remained within normal reference ranges, and the gradual increase seen over 
several years is consistent with the physiological changes accompanying growth in children. 
No Grade 3 or 4 serum creatinine abnormalities were reported. 
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 
Cohort 1 (≥ 12 to < 18 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 35 kg) 
Median (Q1, Q3) baseline eGFR calculated using the Schwartz formula was 156.0 (129.0, 185.0) mL/min/1.73 
m2. A decrease from baseline was observed from Week 1. Median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline at Weeks 
48, 96, 192, 288, and 336 were as follows: 
•  Week 48 (N = 48): −12.2 (−31.5, −1.0) mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Week 96 (N = 46): −19.5 (−34.6, −4.4) mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Week 192 (N = 33): −19.8 (−46.4, −6.0) mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Week 288 (N = 31): −31.0 (−59.0, −9.1) mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Week 336 (N = 4): −38.9 (−57.3, −26.3) mL/min/1.73 m2 
No clinical relevance was attached to this gradual decrease over a period of years given the high median (Q1, 
Q3)  eGFR  at  both  baseline  (156.0  [129.0,  185.0]  mL/min/1.73  m2)  and  Week  288  (138.7  [120.1,  150.2] 
mL/min/1.73 m2) for subjects in this cohort during a transition from adolescence to early adulthood. 
Cohort 2 (≥ 6 to < 12 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 25 kg) 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 73/88 
 
 
Median (Q1, Q3) baseline eGFR calculated using the Schwartz formula was 150.3 (137.8, 165.1) mL/min/1.73 
m2. A decrease from baseline was observed at Week 1 that remained stable through Week 228. Median (Q1, 
Q3) changes from baseline at Weeks 48, 96, 192, and 228 were as follows: 
•  Week 48 (N = 51): 0.2 (−14.3, 14.9) mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Week 96 (N = 45): −2.2 (−20.8, 16.7) mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Week 192 (N = 19): −2.4 (−17.2, 21.1) mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Week 228 (N = 19): −2.9 (−13.9, 14.9) mL/min/1.73 m2 
Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities 
Cohort 1 (≥ 12 to < 18 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 35 kg) 
Grade  3  or  4  laboratory  abnormalities  were  observed for  30.0%  (15  of  50)  of  subjects.  Grade  3  laboratory 
abnormalities reported with greater than single subject incidence were as follows: 
•  Urine red blood cells (RBCs) (20.0%, 10 of 50 subjects; all female) 
•  Neutrophils decreased (8.0%, 4 of 50 subjects) 
•  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (4.0%, 2 of 50 subjects) 
Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities reported were as follows: 
•  Creatine kinase increased (6.0%, 3 of 50 subjects) 
Cohort 2 (≥ 6 to < 12 Years of Age, Weighing ≥ 25 kg) 
Grade  3  or  4  laboratory  abnormalities  were  observed  for  34.6%  (18  of  52)  of  subjects.  Grade  3  laboratory 
abnormalities reported with greater than single subject incidence were as follows: 
•  Neutrophils decreased (15.4%, 8 of 52 subjects) 
•  Urine RBCs (13.5%, 7 of 52 subjects; all female) 
The reported Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities were as follows: 
•  Serum potassium (hyperkalemia; 1.9%, 1 of 52 subjects) 
•  Neutrophils decreased (1.9%, 1 of 52 subjects) 
No notable change to the safety profile of Genvoya was identified in the continued evaluation of safety in the 
extension phase in both cohorts (median duration of exposure for cohort 1: 312.1 weeks; median duration of 
exposure for cohort 2: 168.1 weeks). 
Regarding bone safety only a few subjects experienced a clinically relevant shift from baseline in BMD while 
spine and TBLH HA BMD Z-scores were not significantly changed from baseline through the data-cut date. 
After initial changes from baseline in serum creatinine and eGFR, the following changes were consistent with 
physiological changes associated with growth. Changes over the long-term in eGFR were within normal ranges 
of variability and not considered clinically relevant.

Impact of TFV on kidneys/renal function 
There were no renal AEs nor documented impact on serum creatinine nor eGFR in children 6years and older. 
Again considering adult data the impact of TAF vs TDF containing regimens in renal function is significantly 
lower.  
Data for children 2-<6 years is scarce and only up to W48 of exposure but in line with what is reported for 
older patients. Considering that the impact on renal function is mostly in the first weeks of exposure, this is 
considered to be adequately covered with no need for age or weight base restrictions. 
Clarifications have been provided on the number of patients having eGFR falling below 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 
and below 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 throughout the study. All those patients had transient decreases of eGFR and 
the only case of eGFR value < 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 (single value at Week 96) was not considered related to 
study drug, and fully recovered without suspension of the study treatment. 
Clarification has been made confirming that no cases of infraclinical renal tubulopathy were identified in any 
participant in any cohort of Study GS-US-292-0106. 
Ocular toxicity of TAF-containing products 
Clarifications have been provided on the reported AE with a discussion on the possible causality to TAF- 
containing products exposure which seems of low probability. A discussion on the ocular substudy is also 
made which results led to a removal of this concern as an important potential risk from the EU-RMPs for TAF-
containing products as agreed with the CHMP. 
Potential risk “increased cholesterol and triglycerides with associated cardiovascular events” linked to 
exposure to TAF-containing medicines and long-term exposure of paediatric patients to these medicines 
Considerations have been made regarding the possible impact of this treatment regimen on lipid profile. The 
conclusions seem reassuring of the safety profile. It is acknowledged that, again, the time of 
exposure/follow-up period regarding paediatric patients age 2-<6years of age is still significantly lower but 
this is not seen at this point as problematic considering the time of exposure – effect seen in older patients. 
The  MAH  has  conducted  a  review  of  BMD  data  for  children  ≥  2  to  <  6  years  of  age  receiving  TAF-based 
treatment in Study GS-US-292-0106 and compared the data with BMD information available in the literature 
for children 2 to 6 years of age. Mean TBLH and spine BMD values obtained at baseline in Cohort 3 participants 
(≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg) were similar to those in other populations of children with HIV of 
the same age band, and similar or less than the values reported for different groups of healthy children in age 
groups  that  reflect  the  range  of  ages  of  children  enrolled  in  Cohort  3.  However,  skeletal  gains  shown  by 
increases in BMD after 1 year on E/C/F/TAF in Cohort 3 were comparable to the difference in BMD observed in 
healthy children in the same age group in a 1-year interval.  
 Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No relevant data on this topic could be retrieved from the currently evaluated trial. 
 Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subject discontinued study drug or the study due to an AE through the data cut-off date.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In Cohort 3, i.e. in children aged ≥2 years to <6 years weighting ≥14 kg to <25 kg (n=27), the most commonly 
reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection, cough and decreased appetite and vomiting. The overall 
types of common AEs were consistent with those expected in the study population. Most AEs reported were 
grade 1 in severity.  No Grade 3 or 4 AE and deaths have been reported. No subjects discontinued the study 
due to AE in this cohort. An SAE (pneumonia, not related to study drug) was reported for 1 subject. There were 
no AEs of renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) or traumatic bone fracture. 
AEs related to study drug were reported for 4 subjects, among which only diarrhoea and vomiting, reported for 
2 subjects each, occurred with greater than single subject incidence.  
No  safety  issue  was  identified  regarding  laboratory  abnormalities.  Serum  creatinine  values  remained  stable 
through Week 48; Median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 were 0.00 (−0.05, 0.04) mg/dL 
and  −0.01  (−0.04,  0.04)  mg/dL,  respectively.  Regarding  eGFR  Schwartz,  an  increase  from  baseline  was 
observed at Week 1 that remained relatively stable through Week 48. Median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline 
at Weeks 24 and 48 were 4.1 (−13.8, 26.8) mL/min/1.73 m2 and 9.6 (−11.2, 19.3) mL/min/1.73 m2. 
There were mean increases in both spine and TBLH BMD through Week 48 (spine: Week 24, 3.094%; Week 
48, 5.275%; TBLH: Week 24, 3.816%; Week 48, 7.160%). Two subjects had a ≥ 4% decrease in spine and/or 
TBLH BMD during the study, neither of whom had a clinical shift in their height-age BMD Z-score from > −2 to 
≤ −2. Overall, no subject showed a worsening (change from > −2 to ≤ −2) from baseline in spine height-age 
BMD Z-score at Weeks 24 and 48, while 2 subjects showed such a worsening in TBLH height-age BMD Z-score 
at Week 48. 
Switching to E/C/F/TAF appeared to be well tolerated by virologically suppressed paediatric subjects ≥ 2 years 
of age (weighing ≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg). However, safety data have been gathered in a very limited number of 
patients (n=27) and for a median duration of exposure of 48.3 weeks. 
All issues raised during the assessment were adequately discussed and are generally considered resolved.  
Following a request for further data the MAH has has provided additional data to accommodate for the 
concerns raised on the comparability of BMD in the youngest age group cohort of children aged 2 to 6 years, 
to BMD in healthy children aged 2 to 6 years. Apart from the recognized decreased reproducibility of BMD 
assessment in children younger than 3 years, which is already acknowledged in paediatric guidelines, some 
methodological limitations were reported that could interfere with interpretability of the data, namely a) the 
cross-sectional design of the studies in healthy children; b) the fact that studies in healthy children assessed 
populations of different ethnicities and different ages and c) the fact that different DXA machines and 
software differ among studies.  
The MAH conclusions on the gathered data points to the similarity of mean TBLH and spine BMD values 
obtained at baseline in Cohort 3 participants to those in children with HIV of the same age band, and similar 
or less than those of different groups of healthy children in age groups that reflect the range of ages of 
children enrolled in Cohort 3. Skeletal gains shown by increases in BMD after 1 year on E/C/F/TAF in Cohort 
3 were comparable to the difference in BMD observed in healthy children in the same age group in a 1-year 
interval.

The MAH was asked to address the fact that some uncertainties remain in children concerning the impact of 
long-term exposure to tenofovir delivered by TAF on the growing bone in terms of fracture risk associated with 
renal toxicity even if the impact is lower than with TDF-containing products. Also the fact that renal and bone 
safety data are very limited quantitatively in the 2-6-years-old children was also asked to be discussed.  
A  new  set  of  data  has  been  provided  by  the  MAH  namely  from  study  GS-US-311-1269  were  participants 
received Descovy (F/TAF) were grouped into 2 cohorts (Cohort 1: virologically suppressed adolescents 12 to < 
18 years of age weighing ≥ 35 kg; Cohort 2 Group 1: virologically suppressed children 6 to < 12 years of age 
weighing ≥ 25 kg; Cohort 2 Group 2: virologically suppressed children 2 to < 6 years weighing 17 to < 25 kg). 
Comparing the results the CHMP considered that: 
a) BMD at baseline was similar to children with HIV but lower compared to healthy children which is as expected 
considering the impact of chronic HIV infection on bone health 
b)  Changes  in  BMD  did  occur  in  children  treated  with  TAF  containing  regimens.  These  changes  were  more 
significant  in  the  2-6  years  old  cohort.  Other  possible  causes  of  poor  bone  health  were  not  possible  to  be 
controlled and might have affected the results.  
c) Bone mineralization in the spine and TBLH was comparable in TAF treated with impaired BMD compared to 
healthy children.  
d) When occurring, the negative changes in BMD occur early with treatment with a trend for normalization with 
time.  
e) No fractures were described within the study timeframe and, as the negative consequences on BMD seem 
to improve with time. 
Comparing the results of Cohort 2 of the study GS-US-292-0106 and Cohort 2 Group 1 of the study GS-US-
311-1269, both concerning virologically suppressed children 6 to < 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg, several 
aspects have not been fully addressed by the MAH: 
a)  TBLH  BMD  (g/cm2)  and  Percentage  Change  from  Baseline  by  Visit;  Spine  BMD  (g/cm2)  and  Percentage 
Change from Baseline by Visit - having the similar baseline values there are significant differences in subsequent 
visits assessment; 
b) Spine BMD Height-age Adjusted Z-score and Change from Baseline by Visit - the trend in the evolution is 
different with much earlier improvement in study study GS-US-311-1269 compared to GS-US-292-0106.  
c) The Percentage of Participants with at ≥ 4% Decline from Baseline in TBLH/Spine BMD by Visit is also 
different among the cohorts. 
Overall, the CHMP was of the opinion that existing uncertainties should be managed with appropriate wording 
in the SmPC: 
Section 4.4 
Paediatric population 
Reductions in BMD (≥4%) of the spine and total-body-less-head (TBLH) have been reported in patients aged 
between 3 to <12 years receiving Genvoya for 48 weeks in study GS-US- 292-0106 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
The long-term effects of changes in BMD on the growing bone, including the risk of fracture, are uncertain. A 
multidisciplinary approach is recommended to decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment.

Paediatric population 
The safety of Genvoya was evaluated through 48 weeks in HIV 1 infected adolescent patients aged 12 to < 18 
years weighing ≥ 35 kg (n=100), in children aged 7 to < 12 years weighing ≥ 25 kg (n = 52), and in children 
aged 3 to 9 years and weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg (n = 27).  The safety profile in paediatric patients who received 
treatment with Genvoya was similar to that in adults. After 48 weeks of treatment with Genvoya, reductions in 
BMD of the spine and of the TBLH ≥ 4% have been reported in 2.1% (1/47) and 0.0% of adolescents, in 12.2% 
(6/49) and 3.9% (2/51) of children weighing at least 25 kg, and in 3.7% (1/27) and 0.0% of children aged at 
least 2 years and weighing 14 kg respectively. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of LD Genvoya in children ≥ 2 years of age (weighing ≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) was not 
significantly different from the already known safety profile of standard dose Genvoya. However, safety data 
have been gathered in a very limited number of patients (n=27) and for a median duration of exposure of 48.3 
weeks. 
No notable change to the safety profile of Genvoya was identified in the continued evaluation of safety in the 
extension phase in both cohorts (median duration of exposure for cohort 1: 312.1 weeks; median duration of 
exposure for cohort 2: 168.1 weeks). 
Regarding bone safety only a few subjects experienced a clinically relevant shift from baseline in BMD while 
spine and TBLH HA BMD Z-scores were not significantly changed from baseline through the data-cut date. 
After initial changes from baseline in serum creatinine and eGFR, the following changes were consistent with 
physiological changes associated with growth. Changes over the long-term in eGFR were within normal ranges 
of variability and not considered clinically relevant.  
In light of the limitations in long-term data on the effects of tenofovir on bone and renal health in paediatric 
patients, and furthermore the scarcity of data in the 2–6-year-olds, a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC was 
added along with a description of the decrease in BMD observed with Genvoya in section 4.8. 
In addition to the precautionary statement concerning the bone and renal safety in children 2- < 6 years of 
age, these events shall be monitored in upcoming PSURs. Furthermore, as treatment with INSTIs or TAF may 
be  associated  with  weight  increase,  it  is  considered  critical  to  closely  monitor  this  also  for  the  paediatric 
population. 
In  terms  of  renal  toxicity,  and  considering  the  assessment  performed  during  this  procedure,  it  is  currently 
difficult to identify, in the renal function parameters as presented for Cohort 3, changes over time that are of 
concern.  However,  for  some  of  the  normative  ranges  of  reference  for  these  parameters  (e.g.  RBP)  are  not 
available  in  the  paediatric  population  and  the  interpretation  of  the  ratios  to  urine  creatinine  is  not  always 
straightforward, adding more uncertainty. The discussion on whether TFV levels after the proposed doses of 
TAF for each age/weight band cohort are associated to renal toxicity cannot be based on a simple discussion 
(as provided by the MAH) of data of each of these parameters in isolation and for each of the paediatric cohorts 
per each study.

In what refers to renal and bone toxicity, the SmPC of Genvoya (and of the other medicinal products containing 
tenofovir  alafenamide)  will  be  subject  to  further  revisions/amendments  when  more  data  becomes  available 
(including, but not limited to, data from study -0128, Cohort 3, Cohort 4 and any other cohort as available, 
from study -1474, Cohort 4 and also including paediatric subjects treated with TAF for chronic hepatitis B in 
study -1092).  
The MAH committed to submitting an updated popPK-PD (renal and bone endpoints) report at the time of the 
next paediatric regulatory submission which considers the above. The next anticipated submission is the final 
CSR for GS-US-292-0106 in Q2 2024. Final CSRs for all paediatric studies where TAF-containing products have 
been  evaluated  presenting  and  discussing  the  totality  of  the  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy  data  for  all  age 
cohorts/weight bands will be submitted when all studies are completed will be submitted to the respective MAs 
when available.  
Current expected final CSR dates for the paediatric studies of Gilead’s TAF-containing products are listed below: 
Study GS-US-380-1474, LPLV Dec-24, Submission of CSR Jun-25 
Study GS-US-216-0128, LPLV Mar-26, Submission of CSR Sep-26

Study GS-US-311-1269, LPLV Dec-23, Submission of CSR Jun-24 
Study GS-US-320-1092, LPLV Oct-29, Submission of CSR Apr-30 
Study GS-US-292-0106 is currently in the extension phase and will continue to enable paediatric participants 
to receive Genvoya until such a point as an access program is available. The final CSR is therefore expected to 
be available for submission Q2 2024.

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 6.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Based on the new indication in patients aged ≥ 2 years weighing ≥ 14 kg and considering that efficacy and 
safety data in this age group were collected in a very limited number of patients and for a short median 
duration of exposure, the PRAC is of the opinion that the already existing entry in the EURD list for cobicistat 
/ elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle for the 
medicinal product should follow a half-yearly cycle. The next data lock point will be 4 November 2022.  
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Genvoya 150 mg/150 mg/200 mg/10 mg film-coated tablets. The 
bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HIV-1  infection  continues  to  have  a  significant  global  burden  with  approximately  38  million  people  infected 
worldwide,  including  an  estimated  1.8  million  children  under  15  years  of  age.  There  were  an  estimated 1.7 
million newly acquired cases of HIV infection worldwide in 2019, of which 150,000 (9% of the total) were in 
children under 15 years of age, principally (84%) in sub-Saharan Africa. There were, additionally, an estimated 
95,000 AIDS-related deaths worldwide in children under 15 years of age. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Other INSTI-based ARV indicated in paediatric subjects are as follows: 
- Dolutegravir (Tivicay): available as dispersible tablets and film-coated tablets, indicated in children ≥ 4 weeks 
of age and weighing ≥ 3 kg. 
- Raltegravir (Isentress): available as granules for oral suspension and chewable tablets, indicated in children 
weighing ≥ 3 kg. 
Four other single-tablet regimens (STRs) are currently approved in the EU for once daily administration in the 
in  adolescents  (≥12  years  old):  EVG/COBI/FTC/  TDF  (Stribild),  
treatment  of  HIV-1 
infection

abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine  (Triumeq),  FTC/  RPV/TAF  (Odefsey),  and  DRV/COBI/FTC/TAF  (Symtuza). 
Genvoya is the only once daily STR approved in children. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study GS-US-292-0106 is a Phase 2/3 study initially designed to characterize the PK and confirm the dose of 
the adult GEN tablet (E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg) in ART-naive, HIV-1 infected adolescents ≥ 12 to < 18 
years of age (Cohort 1) and virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age weighing 
≥ 25 kg (Cohort 2). The study was extended in Protocol Amendment 4 to characterize the PK and confirm the 
dose of a low-dose (LD) GEN tablet (E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) in virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected 
children ≥ 2  years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25  kg enrolled in an additional cohort, Cohort 3. The safety, 
tolerability, and antiviral activity of the adult and LD GEN tablets were also evaluated in the cohorts to which 
they were administered. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
For Cohort 3, at Week 48, high rates of virologic suppression (>90%) were maintained in these virologically-
suppressed  paediatric  subjects,  and  CD4  cell  counts  remained  stable.  No  subject  had  treatment-emergent 
resistance  to  study  drug. Although  the efficacy  data  from  this  paediatric  study  were  not  primary  endpoints, 
these data could be considered supportive. 
Week 48 data for cohorts 1 and 2 were previously submitted. The MAH submitted additional long term results 
from the extension phase of study GS-US-292-0106. Virologic suppression and an accompanying immunologic 
response were maintained in both cohorts through the data-cut date (336 weeks for cohort 1 and 240 weeks 
for cohort 2). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The interpretation of the efficacy results is limited by the design of the study (non-comparative, limited sample 
size).  
Cohort 1 included ARV-naïve subjects while cohorts 2 and 3 included only virologically suppressed subjects. All 
subjects had stable disease and the relevance of the efficacy results to patient with more advanced disease is 
unknown. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The analysis of safety data (GS-US-292-0106) has shown that the overall safety profile of Genvoya (adult dose 
and low dose) in the paediatric population seems comparable to the safety of Genvoya in adults.  
Safety data have been gathered in 50 children ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age weighing ≥ 35 kg, 52 children ≥ 6 to 
< 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg and 27 children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg). The most 
commonly reported AEs were respiratory tract infection and upper respiratory tract infection, cough, abdominal 
pain, decreased appetite and vomiting consistent with those expected in the study population. Most AE were 
grade 1 and 2. One death was reported in cohort 1 (road traffic accident). One subject in cohort 1 had a study 
drug-related SAE. No grade 3 / 4 AE have been considered as related to E/C/F/TAF. Initial increases in serum 
creatinine and decreases in eGFR Schwartz were observed in cohorts 1 and 2, consistent with the known effect 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 83/88 
 
 
of cobicistat on renal tubular secretion. Both renal safety parameters subsequently stabilize as observed in the 
provided  results  from  the  analysis  of  the  extension  phase.  Among  Cohort  3  subjects  receiving  the  GEN  LD 
(E/C/F/TAF 90/90/120/6 mg) tablet, however, the effects on serum creatinine and eGFR were not observed, 
the  possibility  being  that  they  were  masked  by  the  increase  in  eGFR  that  occurs  with  kidney  maturation  in 
childhood. Regarding bone safety only a few subjects experienced a clinically relevant shift from baseline in 
BMD while spine and TBLH HA BMD Z-scores were not significantly changed from baseline through the data-
cut date. Overall no new safety issue has been identified. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data have been gathered in a limited number of children. Safety data is available for a longer exposure 
in cohorts 1 and 2 than for cohort 3 (median duration of exposure for cohort 1: 312.1 weeks; median duration 
of exposure for cohort 2: 168.1 weeks; median duration of exposure for cohort 3: 48.3 weeks). 
The MAH has provided long term bone safety data in 50 children aged 6-12 followed for up to 240 weeks. 
There seems to be some loss of bone mineral density compared to baseline, which may be interpreted as 
progressive. The MAH was asked to discuss the post baseline Z score development for bone mineral density 
in the 6-12 years old and the methodological strength on evidence that there is a loss of BMD secondary to 
starting Genvoya, as well as what would be the clinical implications of the measured values.  
• 
 Bone Safety and growth 
Exposure to TAF regimen in children aged 6 to 12 years resulted in a ≥ 4% decrease in spine BMD at one or 
more timepoints in 10 of 50 exposed patients but this was reversed throughout the subsequent timepoint 
assessments up to Week 240 in most of them. The applicant argues that this early BMD decrease results 
from the fact that patients have rich in metabolically active trabecular bone that would mostly be affected in 
the first weeks of exposure.  Nine (9) participants experienced a shift (5 in spine and 7 in TBLH) in HA BMD Z 
score from > −2 to ≤ −2 at any visit; 3 of these 9 participants shifted back to a Z-score > −2 at subsequent 
visits. Among the other 6, 5 increased their BMD values in spine and TBLH, and increased or maintained a 
stable HA BMD Z-score compared with baseline, although failing to increase BMD as it would be expected 
with growth. One participant experienced a bone fracture (following traumatic event) that the applicant 
considers unrelated to the study drug but for which causality could not be excluded. PK assessments did not 
correlate TAF exposure to impact on BMD (maximum peak exposure does not correlate to higher impact on 
MBD). 
For children aged 2 to 6years old, despite the smaller sample size (n = 27) and shorter follow-up (only up to 
Week 48) the rate of mineralization was as expected for this age group, with spine HA BMD Z-scores 
improving from baseline (as expected with growth). Two participants (1 in spine and 1 in both spine and 
TBLH) showed a ≥ 4% decrease in BMD without a shift in spine HA BMD Z-score from > −2 to ≤ −2. Two 
further participants showed a shift in TBLH HA BMD Z-score from > −2 to ≤ −2 at Week 48 without a 
decrease in their absolute TBLH BMD. Height and weight Z-scores were stable or improved, and no 
participant experienced a bone-related AE. Longer exposure times are not expected to further affect bone 
mineral density as per results of patients treated with TDF-containing regimens, and considering also the 
stability/improvement seen in older cohorts following exposure to TAF-regiments. 
The changes in BMD did not correlate with clinical outcomes (for fractures, apart from the above described 
case) nor biomarkers of bone formation or resorption.  
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 84/88 
 
 
 
 
Compared to TDF-containing regimens, patients exposed to TAF had lower impact on Bone mineralization as 
measured by DXA. A discussion on the lower PK exposures to TFV following TAF Vs TDF (where long terms 
outcomes are available), is also used to point to the long term safety profile of TAF containing regimens. 
The MAH also presented data pointing to the benefit on BMD of the change from TDF-to TAF-containing 
regimens in adults that he believes would be similar for the paediatric population. 
The concerns about the impact of TAF containing regiments on bone mineralization seem to be well 
addressed in children aged 6-<12 years old. The lack of longer follow-up period for the younger subset (2-<6 
years of age) seems to be the most challenging aspect when looking at the available data. The MAH has 
addressed this topic by discussing the impact on bone mineralization with time for the older patients, that 
overall showed a normalization of even improvement of BMD with longer periods of exposure to TAF 
containing regimens.  
• 
Impact of TFV on kidneys/renal function 
There were no renal AEs nor documented impact on serum creatinine nor eGFR in children 6years and older. 
Again, considering adult data the impact of TAF vs TDF containing regimens in renal function is significantly 
lower. Data for children 2-<6 years is scarce and only up to W48 of exposure but in line with what is reported 
for older patients.  
Clarifications have been provided on the number of patients having eGFR falling below 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 
and below 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 throughout the study. All those patients had transient decreases of eGFR and 
the only case of eGFR value < 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 (single value at Week 96) was not considered related to 
study drug, and fully recovered without suspension of the study treatment. 
No cases of infraclinical renal tubulopathy were identified in any participant in any cohort of Study GS-US-
292-0106. Despite the clarifications provided, the available data, though scarce and fraught with uncertainty, 
do seem to indicate an impact of BMD after initiating TAF, and therefore a certain level of risk cannot be 
excluded. Whether the potential magnitude of this, is acceptable or not, may be considered in relation to the 
benefits of the drug in the paediatric population, and may be determined by the prescriber on a case-by-case 
basis.  
In light of the limitations in long-term data on the effects of tenofovir on bone and renal health in paediatric 
patients, and furthermore the scarcity of data in the 2–6-year-olds, a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC was 
added along with a description of the decrease in BMD observed with Genvoya in section 4.8. 
In addition to the precautionary statement concerning the bone and renal safety in children 2- < 6 years of 
age, these events shall be monitored in upcoming PSURs. Furthermore, as treatment with INSTIs or TAF may 
be  associated  with  weight  increase,  it  is  considered  critical  to  closely  monitor  this  also  for  the  paediatric 
population. 
In  terms  of  renal  toxicity,  and  considering  the  assessment  performed  during  this  procedure,  it  is  currently 
difficult to identify, in the renal function parameters as presented for Cohort 3, changes over time that are of 
concern.  However,  for  some  of  the  normative  ranges  of  reference  for  these  parameters  (e.g.  RBP)  are  not 
available  in  the  paediatric  population  and  the  interpretation  of  the  ratios  to  urine  creatinine  is  not  always 
straightforward, adding more uncertainty. The discussion on whether TFV levels after the proposed doses of 
TAF for each age/weight band cohort are associated to renal toxicity cannot be based on a simple discussion 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 85/88 
 
 
 
(as provided by the MAH) of data of each of these parameters in isolation and for each of the paediatric cohorts 
per each study.  
In what refers to renal and bone toxicity, the SmPC of Genvoya (and of the other medicinal products containing 
tenofovir  alafenamide)  will  be  subject  to  further  revisions/amendments  when  more  data  becomes  available 
(including, but not limited to, data from study -0128, Cohort 3, Cohort 4 and any other cohort as available, 
from study -1474, Cohort 4 and also including paediatric subjects treated with TAF for chronic hepatitis B in 
study -1092).  
The MAH committed to submitting an updated popPK-PD (renal and bone endpoints) report at the time of the 
next  paediatric  regulatory  submission  which  considers  the  above.  An  updated  popPK-PD  (renal  and  bone 
endpoints) report will be submitted at the next appropriate paediatric regulatory submission for Gilead’s TAF-
containing products. The next anticipated submission is the final CSR for GS-US-292-0106 in Q2 2024. Final 
CSRs for all paediatric studies where TAF-containing products have been evaluated presenting and discussing 
the  totality  of  the  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy  data  for  all  age  cohorts/weight  bands  will  be  submitted  when  all 
studies are completed will be submitted to the respective MAs when available.  
Current expected final CSR dates for the paediatric studies of Gilead’s TAF-containing products are listed below: 
Study GS-US-380-1474, LPLV Dec-24, Submission of CSR Jun-25 
Study GS-US-216-0128, LPLV Mar-26, Submission of CSR Sep-26

Study GS-US-311-1269, LPLV Dec-23, Submission of CSR Jun-24 
Study GS-US-320-1092, LPLV Oct-29, Submission of CSR Apr-30 
Study GS-US-292-0106 is currently in the extension phase and will continue to enable paediatric participants 
to receive Genvoya until such a point as an access program is available. The final CSR is therefore expected to 
be available for submission Q2 2024. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  efficacy  data  observed  in  either  cohort  of  study  GS-US-292-0106  and  the  efficacy  data  from  adult 
populations is reassuring of a similar antiviral activity and virological suppression with the proposed weight-
doses of Genvoya. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  proposed  doses  of  the  combination  of  elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir  alafenamide  in 
paediatric subjects are expected to be as effective as in adults. Regarding safety, the analysis of the continued 
evaluation of subjects in cohorts 1 and 2 did not show any clinically relevant change from the previously known 
safety profile, specifically in what regards bone and renal safety. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/682126/2022 
Page 86/88 
 
 
The existing restriction of the indication in 6-12 years old is due to the impact of tenofovir on bone turnover 
secondary to its effect on renal calcium and phosphate handling. Exposure to tenofovir in this age stratum is 
higher than in adults, where the safety of tenofovir alafenamide was established. 
The available data, though scarce and limited with uncertainty, indicate an impact of BMD after initiating TAF, 
and therefore a certain level of risk cannot be excluded. Whether the potential magnitude of this, is acceptable 
or not, may be considered in relation to the benefits of the product in the paediatric population, and may be 
determined by the prescriber on a multidisciplinary approach basis.  
These data and concerns were therefore reflected in the product information. In light of the limitations in long-
term  data  on  the  effects  of  tenofovir  on  bone  and  renal  health  in  paediatric  patients,  and  furthermore  the 
scarcity  of  data  in  the  2–6-year-olds  group,  a  warning  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  was  added  along  with  a 
description of the decrease in BMD observed with Genvoya in section 4.8. These events should be monitored 
in upcoming PSURS. Further, as treatment with INSTIs or TAF may be associated with weight increase, it is 
considered key to closely monitor this also for the paediatric population. 
The CHMP also considered that the PSUR cycle will be changed to a 6-monthly interval to allow for increased 
monitoring. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The  overall  benefit/risk  balance  of  Genvoya  is  positive,  subject  to  the  conditions  stated  in  section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of, Genvoya 90 mg/ 90 mg/ 120 mg/ 6 mg is favourable in the following indication: 
•  Genvoya is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection without any 
known mutations associated with resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir in 
adults and paediatric patients aged from 2 years and with body weight at least 14 kg. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Genvoya subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any 
agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan PIP P/0435/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation(s) to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning the 
following change(s):

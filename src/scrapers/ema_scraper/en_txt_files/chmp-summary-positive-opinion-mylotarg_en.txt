Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Mylotarg 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
On 22 February 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Mylotarg, 
intended for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. Mylotarg was designated as an orphan medicinal 
product on 18 October 2000. The applicant for this medicinal product is Pfizer Limited. 
Mylotarg will be available as a 5-mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. The active substance of 
Mylotarg is gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a humanised immunoglobulin G subtype 4 (IgG4) antibody (ATC code: 
L01XC05) directed at CD33 which is conjugated to calicheamicin, a toxin which induces breaks in 
double-stranded DNA, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. 
The benefit with Mylotarg is improvement in event-free survival. The most common (> 30%) side effects of 
Mylotarg when used together with daunorubicin and cytarabine are haemorrhage and infection.  
The full indication is: “Mylotarg is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine 
(AraC) for the treatment of patients age 15 years and above with previously untreated, de novo 
CD33-positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL).” 
It is proposed that Mylotarg should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the use of anticancer 
medicinal products. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made 
available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been granted by the 
European Commission.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Suliqua (insulin glargine/lixisenatide) is the fixed ratio combination of the long-acting human insulin 
analogue insulin glargine U100 with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) lixisenatide.  
Insulin glargine, a recombinant analogue of human insulin providing a 24-hour basal insulin supply after a 
single-dose subcutaneous (SC) injection. Insulin glargine U100 has been marketed as Lantus for 
approximately 18 years. 
Lixisenatide, a primarily postprandial-acting GLP-1 RA, has been approved since 2013 as Lyxumia in the 
European Union (EU). Lixisenatide is currently approved in over 70 countries worldwide. 
The fixed ratio combination of insulin glargine U100 and lixisenatide (hereafter referred to as FRC) 
administered as a once daily (QD) injection has been developed for the treatment of patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not adequately controlled on oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) and/or basal insulin. 
In contrast to a fixed-dose combination, the concept of the FRC allows both insulin glargine titration to 
fasting glucose targets and concomitant slow dose increase of lixisenatide. 
The FRC was approved in the EU in January 2017, under the trade name of Suliqua in combination with 
metformin for the treatment of adults with T2DM to improve glycaemic control when this has not been 
provided by metformin alone or metformin combined with another oral glucose lowering medicinal 
product or with basal insulin. 
In the current application, the MAH proposed to update the product information, based on the results of 
the first 26-week (randomized, open-label, active-controlled) period of the Phase 3b EFC13794 (LixiLan-
G) study. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the FRC in patients with T2DM 
not sufficiently controlled on OAD therapy (metformin ± pioglitazone ± sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 
[SGLT-2] inhibitor treatments) and GLP-1 RA therapy (liraglutide, exenatide, exenatide extended-release, 
albiglutide, and dulaglutide). This population was not studied during the Phase 3 program. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The current application is based on the results of one study, HOE901/AVE0010-EFC13794, hereafter 
referred to as Study EFC13794. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study EFC13794 
This was a 26-week randomized, open-label, active controlled, parallel-group study assessing the efficacy 
and safety of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination in adults with Type 2 Diabetes 
inadequately controlled on GLP-1 receptor agonist and metformin (alone or with pioglitazone and/or 
SGLT-2 inhibitors), followed by a fixed ratio combination single-arm 26-week extension period (LixiLan-
G). 
Methods 
The study was designed as an open-label, 1:1 randomized, active-controlled, 2-arm, 26-week treatment 
duration, parallel group multinational and multicenter Phase 3b study comparing: 
- 
Insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination (FRC) group; 
-  Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist group. 
At the end of the 26-week randomized treatment period, patients from the FRC group were invited to 
participate in a 26-week single arm extension period (data not reviewed in the current application). 
The study comprised 4 periods (see Figure 1): (1) an up-to 2-week screening period; (2) a 26-week 
open-label randomized treatment period; (3) a 26-week single-arm extension period and (4) a post 
treatment safety follow-up period (patients who prematurely discontinue the study treatment will 
continue in the study up to the scheduled date of study completion).

Study participants 
The study recruited outpatients with T2DM diagnosed at least one year prior to screening and who have 
been treated with a once/twice daily (QD/BID) GLP-1 RA (liraglutide, exenatide) for at least 4 months (at 
stable dose for at least 3 months) or a weekly GLP-1RA (exenatide extended-release, albiglutide, 
dulaglutide) for at least 6 months at a stable dose corresponding to the maximal tolerated dose, in 
combination with metformin with or without pioglitazone and/or a SGLT-2 inhibitor prior to screening. Key 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1. 
Table 1 - Key inclusion and exclusion criteria – Study EFC13794 
Inclusion criteria 
- 
T2DM diagnosed at least one year prior to screening visit 
-  Current treatment with GLP-1 RAs for at least 4 months (Liraglutide, Exenatide) or 6 months 
(Exenatide extended-release, Albiglutide or Dulaglutide) in combination with metformin ± 
pioglitazone ± SGLT-2 inhibitor 
Exclusion criteria 
-  HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol) and >9% (75 mmol/mol) 
- 
Body mass index (BMI) ≤20 or >40 kg/m² 
-  Use of anti-diabetic drugs within 3 months prior to screening visit other than those described 
in inclusion criteria 
- 
Previous treatment with insulin in the year prior to screening visit (except for short-term 
treatment due to intercurrent illness including gestational diabetes) 
-  History of hypoglycaemia unawareness 
-  History of metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis within 1 year prior to screening 
visit 
- 
Personal or immediate family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or genetic conditions 
that predispose to MTC (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndromes) 
-  History of stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or heart failure requiring 
hospitalization within the last 6 months prior to screening visit. 
-  Calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L) at screening 
Treatments 
Patients received study treatment with FRC or unchanged GLP-1 RA, both on top of previous OAD therapy 
(metformin ± pioglitazone ± SGLT-2 inhibitors) at stable doses. The dose of the FRC was titrated 
according to the patient’s need for insulin glargine. There were two pens with different insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratios, which allowed insulin glargine titration from 10 to 60 U while limiting 
lixisenatide dose to a maximum of 20 μg/day: 
- 
Peach Pen: pre-filled disposable SoloStar pen-injector containing 3 mL of sterile solution of 100 
U/mL insulin glargine and 50 μg/mL lixisenatide in ratio of 2:1 (2 units of insulin glargine per 1 μg 
lixisenatide); 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 8/56 
 
 
  
  
-  Olive Pen: pre-filled disposable SoloStar pen-injector containing 3 mL of sterile solution of 100 
U/mL insulin glargine and 33 μg/mL lixisenatide in ratio of 3:1 (3 units of insulin glargine per 1 μg 
lixisenatide). 
Initial daily dose of FRC to be administered was 10 U (10 U insulin glargine / 5 μg lixisenatide). During 
the first 8 weeks of treatment, the dose was to be titrated twice a week based on the insulin glargine 
dose, until the patient reached a target fasting SMPG of 4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L (80 to 100 mg/dL) while 
avoiding hypoglycaemia episodes. Thereafter, from Week 8 until Week 26, the dose in units was to be 
adjusted as necessary to maintain this fasting SMPG target. 
The total daily dose of FRC was capped at 60 U. If glucose parameters exceeded the threshold value 
defined for rescue therapy at the maximum defined daily dose of 60 U, the FRC dose was maintained at 
60 U and a rescue therapy was added.  
Choice of comparator 
In the comparison/reference product arm, GLP-1 RAs were administered as per local labelling at the same 
dose schedule as prior to randomization. Per protocol, the dose of GLP-1 RA at screening had to be the 
highest dose approved unless not tolerated according to Investigator’s judgment as documented in the 
patient’s medical file. The GLP-1 RA dose was to be kept stable during the study. 
Non-IMP background therapy (metformin ≥1500 mg/day with or without pioglitazone and/or a SGLT-2 
inhibitor, all at stable doses for at least 3 months) was administered according to the respective local 
product labelling at a stable dose (unchanged versus screening) throughout the study unless there was a 
safety issue related to this treatment. 
Rescue therapy could be given for refractory hyperglycaemia, either as rapid acting insulin for patients in 
the FRC arm who already reached the maximal daily dose of 60 U or as basal insulin for patients in the 
GLP-1 RA arm. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of Study EFC13794 was to demonstrate the superiority of the insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide FRC versus GLP-1 RA in HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26. 
The secondary objectives of the study were: percentage of patients reaching HbA1c targets, FPG, 7-point 
SMPG profile, glycaemic control after a standardized meal test, body weight and safety and tolerability.  
Other objectives included: insulin glargine and lixisenatide doses in the combination group, development 
of anti-insulin antibodies (FRC group), development of anti- lixisenatide antibodies (FRC group) and total 
plasma concentration of lixisenatide before and following injection (FRC group). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c (%) from baseline to Week 26.  
Secondary endpoints included continuous and categorical endpoints, as follows: 
•  Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints 
-  Change in FPG from baseline to Week 26 
-  Change in 7-point SMPG profiles from baseline to Week 26 (each time point and average daily 
value)

Page 9/56 
 
 
  
  
-  Change in 2-hour PPG and in blood glucose excursion during standardized meal test from 
baseline to Week 26 
-  Change in body weight from baseline to Week 26 
•  Categorical secondary efficacy endpoints 
- 
- 
- 
Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c ≤6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at Week 26 
Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol) at Week 26 
Percentage of patients requiring rescue therapy during the 26 weeks treatment period 
•  Other exploratory endpoints: 
- 
Insulin glargine and lixisenatide doses at Week 26 in the FRC group 
-  C-peptide evaluation during standardized meal test from baseline to Week 26 
- 
- 
Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol) with no body weight gain from 
baseline to Week 26 
Percentage of patients reaching the fasting SMPG target (≤100 mg/dL) at Week 26 in the FRC 
group 
- 
Percentage of patients with no weight gain at Week 26 
Sample size 
The sample size calculations are based on the primary efficacy variable change in HbA1c from baseline to 
Week 26 and ITT analysis, with the following assumptions: 
-  A common standard deviation of 1.1% 
-  A 0.4% mean difference between FRC and GLP-1 receptor agonist in change in HbA1c from 
baseline to Week 26 
-  A drop-out rate of 20%. The patients in the FRC group who discontinued treatment are assumed 
to respond the same as the control patients, i.e., no treatment difference between the patients in 
the FRC group who discontinued treatment and the control patients. 
-  A t-test at a 2-sided 5% significance level with at least 90% power. 
Based on the above assumptions, 500 patients (250 per group) were needed for this study. 
Randomisation 
At the end of screening period, eligible patients were centrally randomized (using permuted block 
randomization schedule) via IRT in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment groups. The patients were stratified 
by value of HbA1c at screening (<8%, ≥8%) and GLP-1 receptor agonist subtype at screening (once 
(QD)/twice daily (BID) formulations, once weekly (QW) formulations). 
The study was designed as open-label because of differences in the type and number of pens used to 
administer the FRC and the various GLP-1 RAs in the comparator arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 10/56 
 
 
  
  
Blinding (masking) 
This study had an open-label design. To compensate for lack of blinding, the Investigator and the Sponsor 
did not have access to the data of the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e., HbA1c) nor to the data of the 
standardized meal test endpoints obtained after baseline visit until the end of the 26-week randomized 
comparative study period. The Sponsor’s study team could review the data for the primary efficacy 
parameter in descriptive statistics with the name of the IMP treatment masked during data review 
meetings. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analysis 
The efficacy analysis was based on the modified Intent-to-treat (mITT) population using efficacy 
assessment collected during the study, including those obtained after investigational medicinal product 
(IMP) discontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy. The mITT population consisted of all randomized 
patients who had both a baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment of any primary 
or secondary efficacy variables, irrespective of compliance with the study protocol and procedures. 
Primary efficacy endpoint analysis – primary analysis: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures MMRM) 
under the missing at random framework. The MMRM model included treatment group (FRC or GLP-1 RA), 
randomization strata of HbA1c (<8%, ≥8%) at V1 (Week -2), randomization strata of GLP-1 RA subtype 
(once/BID formulations, QW formulations) at screening, visit (Week 8, Week 12, Week 18, Week 22 and 
Week 26), treatment by-visit interaction and world region as fixed effects, and baseline HbA1c value-by-
visit interaction as a covariate. The adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 for each 
treatment group was estimated in the framework of this model, as well as the between group difference 
in least square (LS) means and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The statistical test was 
2-sided at the significance level of 5%. The primary efficacy endpoint was also analysed by various 
sensitivity analyses including the ANCOVA with missing data at Week 26 imputed with respect to jump to 
control under missing not at random assumption. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary endpoint: 
• 
• 
• 
The same MMRM model as described in the primary analysis including only the scheduled 
HbA1c measurements collected during the 26-week on-treatment period. 
The same MMRM model on the 26-week completers in the mITT population (ie, all mITT 
patients who completed the 26-week open-label randomized treatment period and did not 
start any rescue therapy before the end of the 26-week randomized treatment period) using 
the observed Week 26 values and the same MMRM model as described above. 
The same MMRM model as described in the primary analysis excluding the measurements 
after receiving the rescue therapy. 
•  An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using multiple imputations with respect to jump to 
control under the missing not at random assumption. 
Secondary efficacy endpoint analysis: 
Except for 2-hour PPG and glucose excursion, all continuous secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed 
using the same MMRM approach with the corresponding baseline value-by-visit interaction as a covariate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 11/56 
 
 
  
  
to compare FRC with GLP-1 RA. Differences between treatment groups and CI were estimated within the 
framework of MMRM. 
2-hour PPG and glucose excursion (for each of which only 1 post-baseline assessment was scheduled) 
were analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the missing data at Week 26 imputed by LOCF 
to compare FRC with GLP-1 RA. 
All categorical secondary efficacy endpoints defined were analysed by a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method 
stratified by the randomization strata. The proportion in each treatment group was provided, as well as 
the differences in proportions between groups with associated 2-sided 95% CIs. 
A step-down testing procedure was applied in order to control the type 1 error. Once the primary 
endpoint was statistically significant at the 5% 2-sided level, testing was performed according to the 
following order: percentage of patients reaching HbA1c < 7% at Week 26, FPG, average 7-point SMPG, 2-
hour PPG and/or glucose excursion. When an endpoint was not statistically significant at the 5% level, 
subsequent tests were not performed. 
Additional efficacy analyses: 
Analyses of other efficacy endpoints were descriptive, and no statistical test was performed. 
Safety analysis 
The safety analysis was descriptively performed, based on the safety population, defined as all 
randomized patients who received at least one dose of open-label IMP, regardless of the amount of 
treatment administered. Patients were analysed according to the treatment actually received (as treated). 
Results 
Participant flow 
Subject disposition is shown in Figure 2. Of the 840 patients screened, 514 were randomized (257 
patients in the FRC group and 257 in the GLP-1 RA group) in 112 sites across 9 countries. Of these, 3 
patients (2 in the FRC group and 1 in the GLP-1 RA group) were randomized but not treated, all of them 
per subject’s request and due to “other” reasons. The main reason for screen failures was HbA1c outside 
range at screening visit (198 patients [23.6% of screened patients]). 
Most of the patients completed the 26-week randomized treatment period (89.5% in the FRC group and 
95.7% in the GLP-1 RA group). 
The percentage of patients who permanently discontinued IMP during the 26-week randomized treatment 
period was low in both groups and higher in the FRC group (25 patients [9.7%]) than in the GLP-1 RA 
group (10 patients [3.9%]). The main reasons for IMP discontinuation were other reasons and AEs in the 
FRC group (4.7% and 3.9% respectively) and other reasons in the GLP-1 RA group (3.9%) (Table 2). Of 
note, other reasons did not include any safety-related findings.

Recruitment 
Patients from 9 participating countries were enrolled (Canada, Estonia, Germany, Israel, Romania, 
Slovakia, Spain, Italy, and the United States). Of the 124 centres that conducted screening, patients were 
randomized in 112 sites. 
The study was initiated on 06 July 2016 and completed on 25 May 2018 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
The number of critical or major automatic protocol deviations (i.e., deviations identified from the database 
based  on  preconfigured  rules)  was  small  and  balanced  across  treatment  groups,  with  no  apparent 
distribution pattern (12 [4,7%] in the FRC group vs 8 [3,1%] in the GLP1-RA group). Accordingly, these 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 14/56 
 
 
  
  
 
were unlikely to have any impact on the overall outcome of the study. The most frequent category of major 
or critical automatic deviations in the FRC group was IMP administered but not as per protocol.  
Amendments 
Two  amendments  were  made  to  the  original  protocol.  In  September  2016,  a  single-arm  FRC  26-week 
extension period was introduced to provide additional assessment of all safety, efficacy and other endpoints 
over  52  weeks  in  total.  Additionally,  pharmacokinetic  and  antibody  assessments  were  added  in  the  FRC 
treatment group to gain information about exposure to lixisenatide and to assess the immunogenicity of 
insulin  glargine  and  lixisenatide.  In  May  2017,  inclusion  of  patients  receiving  background  treatment  of 
SGLT-2 inhibitors was allowed. 
Baseline data 
The demographics (Table 3) and patient (Table 4) baseline characteristics were well balanced between 
treatment groups. The median age of patients was 60.0 years and the majority of patients were white 
(94.4%), and males (52.5%). The mean BMI of patients at baseline was about 33 kg/m2, and 
approximately 73% of the patients had a BMI value ≥30 kg/m2, indicating that most patients were obese. 
The diabetic history and disease characteristics at baseline (Table 5) were generally comparable between 
the treatment groups and so did the rate of diabetes microvascular complications. The mean diabetes 
duration was approximately 11 years.  
All patients were on maximal tolerated dose of GLP-1 RA at screening as well as metformin (as per 
inclusion criteria). The mean daily dose at baseline was similar between the treatment groups. Overall, 
16.3% of patients were receiving another OAD at screening: SGLT-2 inhibitors (10.1%) and/or 
pioglitazone (6.6%).

Numbers analysed 
The efficacy analyses based on the mITT population included 505 patients (252 [98.1%] patients in the 
FRC group and 253 [98.4%] patients in the GLP-1 RA group). In addition, 2 patients in the FRC group 
were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses because they did not have post-baseline HbA1c data 
(Table 7).

Outcomes and estimation 
Change in HbA1c (%) from baseline to Week 26 (primary endpoint) 
Mean HbA1c levels throughout the duration of the trial are depicted by treatment group in Figure 3. 
Mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.7% in the FRC group and 7.8% in the GLP-1 RA group. After 26 weeks of 
treatment, HbA1c had on average decreased by -1.02% for the FRC group and -0.38% for the GLP-1 RA 
group, a mean value at Week 26 of 6.74% and 7.41%, respectively. In both treatment groups, mean 
HbA1c decreased during the study with the lowest mean HbA1c value at Week 26. 
The reduction in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 was statistically significant greater in the group treated 
with FRC vs GLP-1 RA (LS mean difference: -0.64%; 95% CI: -0.770 to -0.508; p <0.0001). Four 
sensitivity analyses showed consistent results with the primary analysis.

Responders for HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment 
At Week 26, the percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% was significantly higher in the FRC group 
(61.9%) compared with the GLP-1 RA group (25.7%) (p<0.0001) (Table 8). The percentage of patients 
reaching HbA1c ≤6.5% was also markedly higher in the FRC group (p<0.0001).

Fasting plasma glucose 
The reduction from baseline to Week 26 in fasting plasma glucose was significantly greater in the FRC 
group (-2.28 mmol/L [-40.99 mg/dL]) compared to the GLP-1 RA group (-0.6 mmol/L [-10.88 mg/dL]). 
The LS mean difference between the treatment groups was -1.67 mmol/L (-30.10 mg/dL) (p<0.0001). in 
In the FRC group, FPG reduction mainly occurred during the initial 8 to 12 weeks of treatment, and FPG 
trended toward stabilization after Week 12 (Figure 4).

randomized treatment period - mITT population 
7-point self-monitored plasma glucose profile 
The reduction from baseline to Week 26 in the average daily 7-point SMPG was significantly greater in the 
FRC group (-1.69 mmol/L [-30.36 mg/dL]) compared to the GLP-1 RA group (-0.67 mmol/L [-12.06 
mg/dL]). The LS mean difference between the treatment groups was -1.02 mmol/L (-18.31 mg/dL) 
(p<0.0001) The 7-point SMPG profiles in the FRC group showed a marked decrease from baseline in 
mean plasma glucose values at Week 26 at all time points. The mean plasma glucose values at all time 
points were lower in the FRC group compared to the GLP-1 RA group (Figure 5). 
Prandial glycaemic control during a standardized meal test 
Treatment with the FRC improved postprandial glycaemic control after a standardized liquid breakfast in 
comparison to GLP-1 RA (-3.96 mmol/L [-71.32 mg/dL] in the FRC group and -1.11 mmol/L [-19.99 
mg/dL] in the GLP-1 RA group. The LS mean difference between the treatment groups was -2.85 mmol/L 
(-51.33 mg/dL) (p<0.0001) There was also a greater reduction from baseline in 2-hour plasma glucose 
excursion for the FRC compared to GLP-1 RA: -1.51 mmol/L (-27.20 mg/dL) in the FRC group and -0.52 
mmol/L (-9.40 mg/dL) in the GLP-1 RA group. The LS mean difference between the 2 treatment groups 
was −0.99 mmol/L (p<0.0001)

Body weight 
Body weight increased in the FRC group and decreased in the GLP-1 RA group with a LS mean change 
from baseline to Week 26 of +1.89 kg and -1.14 kg, respectively (LS mean difference was 3.03 kg; 95% 
CI: 2.417 kg to 3.643 kg).  
Percentage of patients requiring rescue therapy 
The percentage of patients who required rescue therapy was lower in the FRC group (4.8%) compared to 
the GLP-1 RA group (15.0%), with a risk difference of -10.00% (95% CI: -14.93%, -5.06%). Of the 12 
patients requiring rescue therapy in the FRC group, 11 had reached the 60 U dose.  
Insulin glargine and lixisenatide dose in the FRC group 
For the FRC group, the mean daily FRC dose increased steadily during the study and reached at Week 26 
a mean dose of 43.5 U for the insulin glargine component and 16.55 μg for the lixisenatide component. 
The final FRC dose at the end of the 26-week randomized treatment period was ≥30 U and ≤60 U for 
79.6% of the patients, with 67 patients (26.3%) receiving the maximum daily dose of 60 U. For the 
subgroup reaching the maximum dose (60 U), the mean HbA1c level at Week 26 was 6.87%, compared 
to 6.69% for those having a final dose <60 U. In the subgroup reaching the maximum FRC dose, 50.7% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020

of the patients had an HbA1c level <7% at Week 26 versus 65.9% for the subgroup having a final dose 
<60 U. 
Patients reaching HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol) with no body weight gain from baseline to Week 26 
At Week 26, the percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol) with no body weight gain 
was 23.0% in the FRC group and 20.9% in the GLP-1 RA group during the 26-week randomized 
treatment period. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analysis of the primary efficacy analysis by baseline factors showed consistent treatment 
effects across most subgroups, including the type of previous GLP-1 RA treatment and the use of SGLT-2 
inhibitors at screening. The 95% CI of the between-group difference included 0 in the subgroups of black 
patients (N=17) and patients aged ≥75 years at screening (N=21) (Figure 6). However, due to limited 
number of patients in these subgroups and the wide CIs, these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Figure 6 - Forest plot of mean change in HbA1c (%) by baseline factor – mITT population 
The post-hoc analysis of the proportion of patients reaching the HbA1c <7% target at Week 26 without 
documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia showed that markedly more patients in the FRC group reached 
this composite endpoint versus the GLP-1 RA group for the plasma glucose threshold ≤3.9 mmol/L (≤70 
mg/dL) (43.3% and 25.3% respectively) and for the threshold <3.0 mmol/L [<54 mg/dL]) (56.7% and 
25.3% respectively).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
This dossier is based on a single Phase 3b Study (EFC13794) and therefore, no pooling of studies was 
performed.  
In Study EFC13794, the overall treatment effect of FRC on glycaemic control in patients with T2DM who 
were inadequately controlled with OAD therapy and GLP-1 RA therapy was consistent with that observed 
in the previously submitted Phase 3 pivotal studies EFC12404 and EFC12405 in patients with T2DM who 
were inadequately controlled with OAD therapy ± basal insulin (Table 10).

Table 10 - Comparison of key efficacy results with FRC in pivotal Phase 3 studies 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No dedicated studies in special populations were performed. The number of patients ≥75 years was small 
(6/252 in the FRC group and 15/253 in the GLP-1 RA group), therefore no conclusions on treatment 
efficacy can be made in this patient group. 
No patients with eGFR < 30 (mL/min/1.73m2) were included in study EFC13794.  
Supportive studies 
In order to support the extension of the indication to allow concomitant treatment with metformin with or 
without SGLT-2 inhibitors, data from two additional clinical trials were provided. 
Study EFC14112, a randomized, 26-week, active-controlled, open-label, 2-treatment arm, parallel-
group and multicentre study comparing the efficacy and safety of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed-
ratio combination to lixisenatide on top of oral antidiabetic drugs in Japanese patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs with a 26-week safety extension 
period. 
In this study, 34 patients (21.1%) received concomitantly the FRC and a SGLT2i. 
In both treatment groups, patients receiving a SGLT2i at screening tended to be younger, had slightly 
higher BMI and shorter diabetes duration as compared to those not receiving a SGLT2i inhibitor. 
Otherwise baseline demographics, patient and disease characteristics were similar. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 28/56 
 
 
  
  
 
 
The difference between the FRC and lixisenatide treatment groups in LS mean HbA1c change from 
baseline was -1.00% (95% CI: -1.429, -0.573) in the subgroup of SGLT2i users, and -1.11% (95% CI: -
1.325 to -0.890) in SGLT2i non-users. Although small and not relevant differences can be observed, 
efficacy results (change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c and FPG) in both FRC and lixisenatide 
treatment groups were generally similar in SGLT2i users and non-users. The results are consistent with 
those observed for the entire population. 
Study EFC14114, a randomized, 26-week, active-controlled, open-label, 2-treatment arm, parallel-
group and multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed-
ratio combination to insulin glargine on top of oral antidiabetic drugs in Japanese patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs. 
In this study, 59 patients (22.7%) received concomitantly the FRC and a SGLT2i. 
In both treatment groups, patients receiving a SGLT2i at screening tended to be younger, had slightly 
higher BMI and shorter diabetes duration as compared to those not receiving a SGLT2i. Otherwise, 
baseline demographics, patient and disease characteristics were similar. 
The difference between the FRC and insulin glargine treatment groups in LS mean HbA1c change from 
baseline was -0.70% (95% CI: -0.952, -0.455) in the subgroup of SGLT2i users, and -0.65 (95% CI: -
0.780 to -0.518) in SGLT2i non-users. Although small and not relevant differences can be observed, 
efficacy results (change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c, FPG and 2-hour PPG) in both FRC and insulin 
glargine treatment groups were generally similar in SGLT2i users and non-users. In particular there was 
no indication of a decreased efficacy of the FRC in the SGLT2i user subgroup and the results were 
consistent with those observed for the entire population. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study EFC13794 was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the FRC of insulin glargine and 
lixisenatide in patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled with GLP-1 RAs in combination with 
OADs. Previous Phase 3 clinical trials have supported the use of the FRC in patients with insufficient 
glycaemic control with OADs (insulin naïve) or basal insulin in combination with OADs (without GLP1-RA 
treatment). The FRC has only been indicated in combination with metformin. 
The study had a 1:1 randomized, active-controlled, 2-arm, 26-week treatment duration, parallel group, 
multinational and multicenter Phase 3b design. At the end of the study, patients in the FRC group were 
offered the possibility to enter an FRC single-arm 26-week extension period (data not included in this 
application). Patients were stratified according to HbA1c (<8%, ≥8%) and GLP-1 RA subtype (once/BID 
formulations, QW formulations). Trial design is considered adequate. The objectives as well as the 
primary and secondary endpoints were relevant. 
This study included 514 patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with daily (about 60% of the 
patients) or weekly (approximately 40%) GLP-1 RAs combined with metformin with or without 
pioglitazone and/or an SGLT-2 inhibitor. At screening, 16.3% of patients were treated with metformin and 
another OAD (SGLT-2 inhibitors [10.1%] and/or pioglitazone [6.6%]). The most common GLP-1 RAs 
received at screening were liraglutide (54.5%) and dulaglutide (20.4%). 
The reasons for choosing an open-label design are understood and accepted although it should be kept in 
mind that the fact that this could introduce bias regarding both the efficacy and safety assessments. 
Patients randomised to their usual treatment may be less prone to intensify their background treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 29/56 
 
 
  
  
whereas patients on the new treatment may be more motivated for lifestyle changes. The awareness for 
adverse events could also be affected by the open-label design. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate and reflect the proposed target population. Patients 
with a BMI>40, severe renal impairment or hepatic impairment were not included. It is worth noting that 
patients with significant concomitant illnesses (e.g. cardiovascular) were excluded. 
Patients entering the study were randomized to either FRC or unchanged GLP-1 RA, both on top of OAD 
therapy (metformin ± pioglitazone ± SGLT-2 inhibitors). In the comparator/reference group arm, a wide 
range of currently available GLP-1 RAs were selected. The choice of comparator is adequate, considering 
the primary objective of the study, which is to investigate the transfer from any GLP-1 RA to Suliqua. 
For the FRC, a titration algorithm was provided. The dosing recommendations were based on the 
approved product information. As in previous phase 3 trials, two pens with different insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratios were used.   
The sample size calculation has considered the fact that missing data will be imputed with a “jump to 
reference” method and hence dilute the treatment effect. This is encouraged. The true mean difference 
between FRC and GLP-1 receptor agonist in change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 is assumed to be 
0.4%. 
The mITT population used for efficacy analyses required patients to have post-baseline assessment of 
efficacy for inclusion. This is not strictly according to the ITT principle and might in theory introduce a 
bias in the comparison between treatment groups. However, less than 2% of patients were excluded from 
the mITT population and hence this is accepted. 
Four sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary efficacy endpoint, whereof one was based on a 
missing not at random assumption. The sensitivity analyses described address slightly different estimands 
as compared to the primary analysis. With the small amount of missing data presented in this study, the 
sensitivity analyses are considered adequate. 
The type I error is controlled with a hierarchical testing procedure which is accepted. The statistical 
methods were adequate. 
The study appears adequately conducted. One major protocol deviation related to the randomization 
procedure was adequately handled. Two major amendments where done to the original protocol dated 11 
February 2016, being the most important the inclusion of patients treated with SGLT2i. 
The baseline demographics seems to be well-balanced between study groups. The study population was 
representative of inadequately controlled T2D patients, thus qualifying for intensification of therapy. The 
study groups had a similar HbA1c at baseline. Stratification by HbA1c and type of GLP1-RA was similar 
between groups. The majority of patients were obese (72.8 %). 
Disease characteristic and metabolic control were similar between study groups. Patients with severe 
renal impairment were not included in the study. This is accepted as the use of Suliqua has not been 
investigated this patient group. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study EFC13794 met the primary objective, showing a difference of 0.64% in HbA1c in favour of the 
FRC group after 26 weeks. The difference was already seen at 8 weeks. Significantly more patients 
reached the 7.0 % HbA1c target in the FCR treated group (respectively 61.9% and 25.7%) (p<0.0001). 
Starting from slightly different baseline levels (9.06 mmol/L for FRC and 9.45 mmol/L for GLP-1 RA), the 
reduction in FPG was greater in the FRC group compared to the GLP-1 RA group (p<0.0001), and patients

in the FRC group reported a greater decrease in the average 7-point SMPG profile from baseline to Week 
26 compared to patients in the GLP-1 RA group (p<0.0001). Seven-point SMPG profiles showed that 
values at all Week 26 time points were reduced from baseline and lower in the FRC group compared to 
the GLP-1 RA group. 
Treatment with FRC improved prandial glycaemic control during a standardized meal test compared to 
GLP-1 RA, as shown by the results of change from baseline in 2-hour PPG (treatment difference: -2.85 
mmol/L [-51.33 mg/dL], p<0.0001) as well as in 2-hour plasma glucose excursions (treatment 
difference: -0.99 mmol/L [-17.80 mg/dL], p<0.0001). 
As expected, body weight increased in the FRC group and decreased in the GLP-1 RA, due to the addition 
of insulin treatment (+1.89 kg and -1.14 kg, respectively; LS mean difference was 3.03 kg). 
The percentage of patients requiring rescue therapy in the FRC group (4.8%) was lower compared to the 
GLP-1 RA group (15.0%). 
The mean daily insulin dose increased over the study period, reaching a mean value of 43.50 U (0.46 
U/kg) at Week 26. Most patients (79.6%) had final insulin daily doses of ≥30 U to ≤60 U. At week 26, the 
mean daily dose of the lixisenatide component in the FRC group was 16.55 μg/day, and most patients 
(75.3%) had a final dose of ≥15 to ≤20 μg.  
Ancillary analyses support the primary outcome. No conclusion can be made on the effect of the FRC in 
black patients and those >75 years old due to the limited amount or data. 
The effects related to glycaemic control of the FRC observed in this population were consistent with those 
observed in the overall population of Phase 3 studies. Following the switch from the pre-trial GLP-1 RA, 
no relevant increase in mean fasting SMPG values was observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment, 
mitigating the risk of potential deterioration of glycaemic control after switch from pre-trial GLP-1 RA to 
FRC. 
Data from the subgroup analysis in patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors in study EFC13794 together 
with supportive data from two Japanese studies were provided to support the concomitant use of the FRC 
with SGLT-2 inhibitors. The efficacy data for this group were consistent across the different studies 
showing an added benefit of SGLT-2 inhibitors. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study EFC13794 was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the FRC Suliqua (insulin glargine and 
lixisenatide) in patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled with GLP-1 RAs in combination with 
OADs. Suliqua is already approved in patients treated with metformin alone or combined with OADs 
(insulin naïve) or those on basal insulin in combination with OADs. 
The data shown in Study EFC13794 provide evidence that T2DM patients with suboptimal metabolic 
control on GLP1-RA may benefit from the addition of basal insulin by switching incretin therapy to the FRC 
of Suliqua. The study also provides limited information on the concomitant use of Suliqua and 
pioglitazone and/or SGLT2i in addition to metformin. The use of Suliqua concomitantly with SGLT-2 
inhibitors was further supported by subgroups from 3 prospective clinical studies. Even if the data are 
limited, SGLT2i seem to have an added benefit when combined with the FRC. 
No further measures are considered necessary to address issues related to clinical efficacy.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evaluation of this variation is based on data collected during the first 26-week (randomized) of 
Study EFC13794. The cut-off date for this dossier was 09 July 2018 (database lock of the first 26-week 
[randomized] treatment period). No pooling of studies was performed for safety. The 26-week extension 
period is ongoing. 
Patient exposure 
The safety population of Study EFC13794 consisted of all randomized patients who received at least 1 
dose of open-label drug (regardless of the amount of treatment administered). Patients were analysed for 
safety analyses according to the actual treatment received. 
Of the 840 patients screened, 514 were randomized (257 patients in each treatment group). The 
percentage of patients completing the 26-week randomized treatment period was high in both treatment 
groups (89.5% in the FRC group and 95.7% in the GLP-1 RA group). The most common reason for 
discontinuation were other reasons (not caused by adverse events, hypoglycaemia, lack of efficacy or 
poor compliance to protocol) and AEs in the FRC group (4.7% and 3.9%, respectively). 
During the 26-week randomized treatment period, the cumulative duration of treatment exposure was 
similar between the two treatment groups, 121 PY and 127 PY for FRC and GLP-1 RA group, respectively 
(Table 11). Median treatment duration was 183 days in both treatment groups. The majority of patients 
in both treatment groups were exposed for ≥169 days (90.2% in the FRC group and 95.7% in the GLP-1 
RA group).

treatment period – Safety population 
Adverse events 
Definition of safety variables in Study EFC13794 was consistent with the safety analyses performed in 
previous Phase 2/3 studies. Safety analysis focused on the following variables: 
-  Symptomatic hypoglycaemia (documented, probable, severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia); 
-  Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 33/56 
 
 
  
  
 
-  Adverse events of special interest (AESI): confirmed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase >3 
x upper limit of the normal (ULN), pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the study or 
in a female partner of a male patient entered in a study with IMP/non-investigational medicinal 
product (NIMP), and symptomatic overdose with IMP or NIMP; 
-  Other significant AEs: AEs related to injection site reactions, allergic/hypersensitivity events, 
pancreatic events, patients with increased calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL, and device-related events 
(DREs); 
-  Safety laboratory values, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
- 
Immunogenicity (FRC group): anti-insulin antibodies (AIAs) and anti-lixisenatide antibodies 
(ADAs). 
Adjudication committees 
Two external and independent adjudication committees (listed below) reviewed and adjudicated events 
reported during the study using blinded data: 
- 
- 
The Allergic Reaction Assessment Committee (ARAC) adjudicated allergic or possible allergic 
events; 
The Pancreatic Safety Assessment Committee (PSAC) adjudicated pancreatic events. 
Common adverse events 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) observed in Study EFC13794 during the 26-week treatment 
period are summarized in Table 12 . The percentage of patients who had at least one TEAE was higher in 
the FRC group than in the GLP-1 RA group (163 patients [63.9%] vs. and 121 patients [47.3%]). The 
rate of serious TEAEs was similar in both treatment groups (3.9% in the FRC group and 3.5% in the GLP-
1 RA group) (Table 12 ). The percentage of patients who permanently discontinued due to a TEAE was 
higher in the FRC group (3.5%) compared with the GLP-1 RA group (no discontinuations); Five of nine 
patients in the FRC group discontinued due to TEAEs in the gastrointestinal disorder system organ class 
(SOC). The majority of patients across both treatment groups had TEAEs that were considered as mild or 
moderate in intensity. 
Table 12 - Overview of adverse event profile: treatment-emergent adverse events during the 
26-week randomized treatment period in Study EFC13794 
The following TEAEs at the SOC level were reported more frequently in the FRC group compared with the 
GLP-1 RA group: gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders, general disorders and 
administration site conditions, metabolism and nutrition disorders, and investigations. The most 
commonly reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (9.8% of patients in the FRC group versus 9.0% of 
patients in the GLP-1 RA group), nausea (8.6% and 2.3%, respectively) and diarrhoea (5.5% and 2.3%, 
respectively) Table .

group) by primary SOC and PT during the 26-week randomized treatment period 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
During the 26-week randomized treatment period, no patient died or experienced TEAE leading to death 
(Table 12). The percentage of patients who had at least 1 serious TEAE was similar between the 
treatment groups (3.9% in the FRC group and 3.5% in the GLP-1 RA group), and there were no 
significant differences between the treatment groups regarding the type of events reported. The serious 
TEAE of fall was reported in 2 patients (0.8%) in the FRC group (both events unrelated to 
hypoglycaemia), and all other SAEs were reported in no more than 1 patient in either treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 35/56 
 
 
  
  
 
None of the serious TEAEs were considered by the Investigator as possibly related to drug except for an 
event of hypoglycaemic unconsciousness in the FRC group.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
During the 26-week treatment period, 84 patients (32.9%) in the FRC group experienced at least one 
symptomatic hypoglycaemic event compared to 11 patients (4.3%) in the GLP-1 RA group (Table 14). 
The corresponding numbers of events per patient-year were 2.03 and 0.13, respectively. There were no 
symptomatic hypoglycaemic events leading to treatment discontinuation. 
Furthermore, more patients in the FRC group experienced at least 1 documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemic event with plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L (≤70 mg/dL) (71 patients [27.8%]) compared to 
6 patients (2.3%) GLP-1 RA group). 
There was a single severe symptomatic hypoglycaemic event, reported in the FRC group. This event 
(preferred term [PT]: Hypoglycaemic unconsciousness) was also assessed as an SAE.

Adverse events related to injection site reactions 
The incidence of any injection site reactions was 2.0% (n=5) in the FRC group and no patients in the 
GLP-1 RA group reporting an event. None of the injection site reaction TEAEs were serious, had a severe 
intensity or led to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Allergic/hypersensitivity events 
Two events (occurring in 2 patients) were adjudicated as allergic reactions by the ARAC: Urticaria (hives), 
originally reported as “allergic reaction to nitrofurantoin mono-mcr” (PT: drug hypersensitivity) and 
asthma, originally reported as “worsening/relapse of seasonal allergies” (PT: seasonal allergy). Neither 
event was assessed as related to drug by the ARAC. No allergic reaction was reported in the GLP-1 RA 
group.  
Pancreatic events 
Per protocol, any increase in amylase and/or lipase >2 x ULN that had been confirmed by a repeat 
measurement was to be monitored and documented on a specific AE form and its associated 
complementary forms to be sent to an independent PSAC for adjudication. 
During the first 26-week on-treatment period, the rate of TEAEs reported was similar in the FRC group 
and GLP-1 RA group (6 patients in each group; 2.4%, respectively).  All events were sent to PSAC for 
adjudication of pancreatitis. There was a single positively adjudicated pancreatic event: one patient in the 
FRC group had pancreatic enzymes increase that was adjudicated by the PSAC as chronic pancreatitis not 
related to the IMP. 
Pancreatic neoplasm related events were searched for based on a coding list of high-level terms (HLTs) 
and PTs related to pancreas, as well as using the Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities

(MedDRA) Query (SMQ) Malignancies and by searching for the term “pancreas” among PTs. No event was 
sent to PSAC for adjudication of pancreatic neoplasm. 
Device-related events (DREs) 
The percentage of patients with events reported on the DRE questionnaire was higher in the FRC group 
(21 patients [8.2%]) compared with the GLP-1 RA group (5 patients [2.0%]). None of the events were 
associated with a clinical event (i.e., symptomatic hypoglycaemia or any other AE) 
Immunological events 
Anti-insulin glargine antibodies 
During the study, the anti-insulin antibody (AIA) status and concentrations were studied. The percentage 
of AIA positive patients increased from 2.1% (3 of 144 patients) at baseline to 17.4% (39 of 224 
patients) at Week 26. The median AIA titer value did remained stable at Week 26 as compared to 
baseline.  
The percentage of patients experiencing at least 1 TEAE was similar in AIA positive patients (67.5%) and 
AIA negative patients (64.9%). The number of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic events with 
plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L (≤70 mg/dL) per patient year was similar in AIA positive patients (1.34) 
and AIA negative patients (1.60).  
In patients with positive AIA status, the percentage of patients with antibodies cross-reacting with human 
insulin was 100% (3 of 3 patients) at baseline and 94.7% (36 of 38 patients) at Week 26. 
Anti-lixisenatide antibodies 
The percentage of Anti-lixisenatide (ADA) positive patients increased from 16.8% (24 of 143 patients) at 
baseline to 44.5% (98 of 220 patients) at Week 26. At baseline, 7 of the 24 ADA positive patients had 
quantifiable ADA concentrations (median 16.13 nmol/L), and one of these patients had an ADA 
concentration above 100 nmol/L. At Week 26, 29 of the 98 ADA positive patients had quantifiable ADA 
concentrations (median 22.04 nmol/L), and 7 of these patients had ADA concentrations above 100 
nmol/L.  
The percentage of patients experiencing at least 1 TEAE was similar in ADA positive patients (67.2%) and 
ADA negative patients (63.2%). The number of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic events with 
plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L (≤70 mg/dL) per patient year was similar in ADA positive patients (1.43) 
and ADA negative patients (1.58)  
The percentage of patients with antibodies cross-reacting with GLP-1 was 0% at baseline (0 of 24 
patients) and 4.1% (4 of 98 patients) at Week 26. The percentage of patients with antibodies cross-
reacting with glucagon was 4.2% at baseline (1 of 24 patients) and 2.0% (2 of 98 patients) at Week 26. 
Laboratory findings 
Lipids 
There were no relevant differences between the two treatment groups and no relevant changes in either 
treatment group from baseline value to last on-treatment value for total cholesterol and high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Change from baseline in triglycerides differed between the two treatment 
groups: median change from baseline to Week 26 was -13.67% in the FRC group and 1.75% in the GLP-1 
RA group. Change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol differed between the two 
treatment groups: median change from baseline to Week 26 was 7.12% in the FRC group and 2.18% in 
the GLP-1 RA group.

Pancreatic enzymes 
Mean lipase and amylase values remained relatively constant throughout the study with no relevant 
increases in the FRC group versus the GLP-1 RA. The percentage of patients with at least 1 lipase value 
≥3 x ULN during the first 26-week on-treatment period was low in both treatment groups with no 
relevant difference between the treatment groups (2.0% and 2.4% for the FRC and GLP-1 RA group, 
respectively). One patient (0.4%) in the FRC group and no patients in the GLP-1 RA group reported at 
least 1 amylase value ≥3 x ULN. 
Calcitonin 
Calcitonin values ≥20 and <50 ng/L were reported in 1 patient (0.4%) in the FRC group and 1 patient 
(0.4%) in the GLP-1 RA group; although, none of these values were confirmed by a repeat measurement. 
No patients had a serum calcitonin value ≥50 ng/L (pg/mL). 
Electrolytes 
There was no relevant change from baseline value in either treatment group for electrolytes (sodium, 
potassium, calcium, phosphorus). 
Liver function 
There was one TEAE of confirmed ALT increase (>3 x ULN), reported in 1 patient (0.4%) in the FRC 
group. The event was not serious, did not lead to treatment discontinuation and was not considered as 
possibly related to the drug by the Investigator. 
No patients had ALT >5 x ULN in either treatment group. One patient (0.4%) in each treatment group 
had ALT >3 x ULN; however, no subject had a value that met Hy’s law criteria. 
Renal function 
The percentage of patients with mild or moderate renal impairment during the first 26-week on-treatment 
period was similar between the treatment groups. No severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease 
was reported. Two patients (0.8%) in each treatment group had creatinine values ≥150 μmol/L (1.70 
mg/dL). The number of patients with a creatinine value of ≥30% change from baseline was low with no 
relevant differences between treatment groups. The percentage of patients with post-baseline uric acid 
values >408 μmol/L (6.858 mg/dL) was similar between the treatment groups. 
Vital signs 
During the study period, there were small changes from baseline in sitting systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate with no relevant differences between the treatment groups. The 
percentages of patients with PCSAs for blood pressure and heart rate during the first 26-week on-
treatment period was low and similar between the treatment groups. Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg 
and increase from baseline ≥20 mmHg was reported in 4.4% of patients in the FRC group and 2.7% of 
patients in the GLP-1 RA group. Diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥10 
mmHg was reported in 1 patient in the GLP1-RA group.  
No heart rate ≥120 bpm and increase from baseline ≥20 bpm was reported in any patients. 
Use in pregnancy 
Pregnancy 
One pregnancy was reported in a woman randomized in the FRC group. She had her last menstrual 
period on Day 74 of the study, and pregnancy was detected on Day 127. The IMP was permanently 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 39/56 
 
 
  
  
discontinued with the last dose administered on Day 126. On Day 343, the patient delivered a healthy 
baby via caesarean section. 
Another pregnancy started during the pre-treatment period and was detected in the blood sample taken 
on Day 1 of the study. However, before the results were received and the patient contacted, she was 
exposed to IMP for 7 days during her pregnancy. Her glycemia was not well controlled at screening as 
indicated by the screening HbA1c value (8.9%). She had a history of miscarriage. The last menstrual 
period was on Day -30 of the study. The IMP and metformin were permanently discontinued with the last 
dose administered on Day 7 for FRC and Day 8 for metformin. On Day 62, the patient had a missed 
abortion (PT: abortion missed). Pregnancy was terminated on Day 64 with no complications, and the 
patient recovered.  
Both events of pregnancies were assessed as not related to the IMP by the both Investigator and the 
Sponsor. 
Overdose 
No TEAEs of symptomatic overdose was reported during the first 26-week on-treatment period. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In the current study, no relevant differences in the proportion of patients reporting TEAEs by age group 
(<50 years, ≥50 to <65 years, ≥65 to <75 years, ≥75 years) were identified in either treatment group 
(range: 59.5% to 66.7% in the FRC group and 44.6% to 66.7% in the GLP-1 RA group). 
In the FRC group, the highest number of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic events (plasma 
glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L [≤70 mg/dL]) per patient year was observed in the ≥65 to <75 years age group 
(2.05 events per patient year versus 1.37 in the ≥50 to <65 years age group and 1.19 in the <50 years 
age group; the comparison is not meaningful for the ≥75 years age group because of the small number of 
patients [N=21]; of note, no patients reported such events in this group). In the GLP-1 RA group, the 
numbers of events per patient year were low and similar in all age groups (between 0 and 0.13 events 
per patient year).  
The numbers of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic events (plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L [≤70 
mg/dL]) were similar across age groups (between 1.4 and 1.6 events per patient year). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
N/A 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During the 26-week randomized treatment period, TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation 
were reported in 9 (3.5%) patients in the FRC group versus none in the GLP-1 RA group (Table 15 ). The 
most common TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were nausea (3 patients [1.2%]) 
and weight increased (2 patients [0.8%]). All other PTs were reported only for 1 patient in the FRC group. 
None of the TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were serious.

Post-marketing experience 
The FRC has not been approved for the treatment of T2DM in patients not sufficiently controlled on OAD 
therapy and GLP-1 RA therapy. Therefore, no post-marketing data is available for this patient population. 
Safety data from supportive studies 
Study EFC14112 
Overview of safety did not reveal differences between SGLT2i users and non-users. Regarding common 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs in the gastrointestinal disorder System Organ Class

(SOC) were reported less frequently in the FRC treatment group in SGLT2i users when compared to the 
SGLT2i non-users (17.6% versus 32.3%, respectively). Similarly, documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L [≤70 mg/dL]) in the FRC group tended to be reported less 
frequently in SGLT2i users compared to non-users (number of events per patient year: 0.18 and 1.14, 
respectively).  
Study EFC14114 
Overview of safety did not reveal differences between SGLT2i users and non-users. Regarding common 
TEAEs, TEAEs in the gastrointestinal SOC were also reported numerically less frequently in the FRC group 
in SGLT2i users when compared to SGLT2i non-users (22.0% versus 27.4%, respectively). Documented 
symptomatic hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L [≤70 mg/dL]) was reported in similar 
proportions of SGLT2i users and non-users.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population from Study EFC13794 consisted of all randomized patients who received at least 1 
dose of open-label fixed ratio combination of insulin glargine/lixisenatide (FRC) or GLP-1 receptor agonist 
(albiglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide or liraglutide). Of the 257 randomized patients in each treatment 
group, 90% completed the study in the FRC group and 96% in the GLP-1 RA group. The most common 
reason for IMP discontinuation were AEs and other reasons (not caused by adverse events, 
hypoglycaemia, lack of efficacy or poor compliance to protocol) in the FRC group (3.9% and 4.7%, 
respectively). 
The percentage of patients who had at least 1 TEAE was higher in the FRC group than in the GLP-1 RA 
group (64% vs. 47%). Most patients across both treatment groups had TEAEs that were considered as 
mild or moderate in intensity. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (9.8% and 9.0%), nausea (8.6% and 2.3%), 
and diarrhoea (5.5% and 2.3%) in the FRC and the GLP-1 RA groups, respectively, which are expected 
and labelled events for Suliqua. In the initial MAA, nausea was reported in 10% of FRC-treated patients, 
in line with the observed rate in the current study. 
The percentage of patients who permanently discontinued drug due to a TEAE was overall low with a 
higher percentage of patients in the FRC group (3.5%) compared with the GLP-1 RA group (no 
discontinuations). The majority of patients (5 of 9) in the FRC group discontinued due to events of 
gastrointestinal disorders. GI events occurred shortly after initiation of FRC, which is not expected in this 
population as all patients in the FRC group had been transferred from a GLP1-RA. The imbalance in GI 
events between groups could however be explained by the fact that patients continuing GLP-1 RA 
treatment were shown to be tolerant to this therapy. Different GLP-1 RA may have a slightly different AE 
profile related to their pharmacokinetics, e.g. the mode of action of lixisenatide (predominantly post-
prandial) is slightly different from other GLP1-RAs used as background medication (e.g. a longer-acting 
compounds). Indeed, 54.5% of the patients were treated with liraglutide, 20% with dulaglutide and 
18.1% with exenatide extended-release. However, the percentage of patients who discontinued 
treatment due to GI AEs remains low (2%). 
Similar numbers of serious TEAEs were reported in the FRC group (10 patients [3.9%]) and in the GLP-1 
RA group (9 patients [3.5%]). None of the events were assessed as related with drug intake, except for 
one SAE of severe hypoglycaemia in the FRC group. No deaths occurred in either study group during the 
trial.  
As expected, the frequency of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was higher (33% in the FRC group as 
compared to the GLP1-RA group (4.3%). That was even the case for documented symptomatic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 42/56 
 
 
  
  
hypoglycaemic events with plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L (≤70 mg/dL) (28% compared to 2.3%) and 
≤3.0 mmol/L (≤54 mg/dL) (9.4% compared to 0.4%). The higher rate of hypoglycaemia in the FCR 
group is concomitant with the addition of insulin treatment, as expected. Only one episode of severe 
hypoglycaemia (FRC group) was reported during the study. 
The incidence of any injection site reactions was 2.0% (n=5; all non-serious) in the FRC group and no 
event in the GLP-1 RA group. 
Two events of allergic reactions (urticaria and asthma) were reported in two patients in the FRC group 
and no events in the GLP-1 RA group. Both events were adjudicated as not related to the drug.  
One FRC-treated patient reported a pancreatic TEAE; however, adjudicated as a chronic pancreatitis and 
not related to FRC.  
The incidence of pancreatic neoplasm was and adverse event of ‘special interest’. No pancreatic neoplasm 
was reported in either treatment group; however, the risk for developing malignancies cannot be fully 
explored in this study with a rather short observation period.  
The incidence of device-related events (such as device performance failure, confusing instructions or use 
error difficulty) was higher in the FRC-group (8.2%) compared with the GLP-1 RA group (2.0%). This 
difference may be explained by the fact that patients in the GLP1-RA group continued with the same 
injection device they were familiar to prior to the inclusion in the study. However, none of the events 
were associated with a clinical event (i.e. symptomatic hypoglycaemic event, hyperglycaemic AE or any 
other AE). 
During 26 weeks of treatment, the percentage of AIA (anti-insulin antibodies)-positive patients increased 
from 2.1% to 17% and ADA (anti-lixisenatide antibodies)-positive patients from 17% to 45%. In the FRC 
group, there was no substantial difference in the TEAE profile or documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
incidence between the antibody-positive and antibody-negative populations. In particular, there was no 
indication of any impact of antibody status on allergic reactions. The 5 cases of injection site reactions 
occurred in ADA-positive patients. However, the small number and the nature of reported events 
precluded any meaningful conclusion from the summaries of events by the ADA status. Low percentages 
(<5%) of patients with positive ADA status and having a cross-reactivity assessment had antibodies 
cross-reacting with GLP-1 or glucagon.  
Change from baseline in triglycerides was -14% in the FRC group and 1.8% in the GLP-1 RA group. 
Change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was 7.1% in the FRC group and 2.2% 
in the GLP-1 RA group. Improvement in LDL and triglycerides in the FRC group is most likely related to 
the improvement in glucose metabolism.  Lipase values ≥3xULN increased similar in the FRC group 
(2.0%) and GLP-1 RA group (2.4%); and amylase values ≥3 x ULN was reported in one patient (0.4%) in 
the FRC group and in no patients in the GLP-1 RA group. 
Two pregnancies were reported during the study and the treatment was immediately discontinued 
according to the study protocol. Suliqua should not be used during pregnancy, as stated in section 4.6 of 
the SmPC. No relevant differences in the proportion of patients reporting TEAEs by age group (<50 years, 
≥50 to <65 years, ≥65 to <75 years, ≥75 years) were identified in either treatment group (range: 
59.5% to 66.7% in the FRC group and 44.6% to 66.7% in the GLP-1 RA group). Based on the current 
available data, Suliqua can be used in elderly patients, although experience of use in patients ≥75 years 
of age is limited. 
Overall, the FRC was well tolerated during the 26-week treatment period. The safety profile of the FRC 
group generally reflected those of its components, and no new or unexpected safety signals were 
identified.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile for the fixed combination of lixisenatide/insulin glargine in Study EFC13794 is similar to 
that of its components and in line with previous phase 3 studies. As with other GLP1-RAs, gastrointestinal 
side effects remain the most common AE. The higher rate of hypoglycaemia in the insulin naïve FRC 
group is concomitant with the addition of insulin treatment, as expected. Only one episode of severe 
hypoglycaemia was reported in the FRC group. The study provides limited safety data on the concomitant 
use of Suliqua and pioglitazone and/or SGLT2i in addition to metformin. No new safety concerns were 
identified from the analysis of AEs reported in Study EFC13794. Gastrointestinal events, injection site 
reactions and urticaria are labelled and expected events for Suliqua.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Suliqua is the fixed ratio combination (FRC) of the GLP-1 RA lixisenatide and the basal insulin glargine. 
Lixisenatide is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with T2DM. Insulin glargine is used 
in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients.  
The currently applied indication for Suliqua is; 
“Suliqua is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to 
improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise in addition to metformin and/or SGLT-2 
inhibitors. (For study results with respect to effects on glycaemic control, and the populations studied, see 
Section 4.4 and 5.1).” 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Due to the pathophysiology of the disease, the majority of T2DM patients require more treatment as the 
disease progresses and beta-cell function declines over time. A poly-pharmaceutical approach is often 
preferred in order to achieve good metabolic control. The aim of the current variation application is to 
investigate the feasibility of switching patients inadequately controlled on treatment with GLP1-RAs (on 
top of OADs) to the FRC. Both GLP1-RAs and insulin are administered as subcutaneous injections. Based 
on the results of a new study, the MAH proposed changes to several sections of the SmPC, including the 
wording of the indication. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
Study EFC13794 was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the FRC Suliqua (insulin glargine and 
lixisenatide) in patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled with GLP-1 RAs in combination with 
OADs. Patients randomised to Suliqua continued their background OAD treatment throughout the study. 
The study had a 1:1 randomized, active-controlled, 2-arm, 26-week treatment duration, parallel group, 
multinational and multi-center Phase 3b design. It included 514 patients with T2DM inadequately 
controlled with daily or weekly GLP-1 RAs combined with metformin with or without pioglitazone and/or 
an SGLT-2 inhibitor. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate and reflect the proposed target 
population. The study appears adequately conducted. The subject population included in the study was 
representative of the expected target population. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met the primary objective. The change in HbA1c was greater with Suliqua when compared to 
unchanged GLP1-RA therapy (LS mean difference: -0.64%; 95% CI: -0.770 to -0.508; p <0.0001). 
HbA1c decreased on average -1.02% in the FRC group and -0.38% in the GLP-1 RA group. 
All studied secondary endpoints support the primary outcome. The percentage of patients reaching HbA1c 
<7% was significantly higher in the FRC group (61.9%) compared with the GLP-1 RA group (25.7%). The 
reduction in fasting plasma glucose was significantly greater in the FRC group (-2.28 mmol/L) compared 
to the GLP-1 RA group (-0.6 mmol/L). The mean plasma glucose values at all time points in the 7-point 
SMPG profiles were lower in the FRC group compared to the GLP-1 RA group. Treatment with the FRC 
improved postprandial glycaemic control after a standardized liquid breakfast in comparison to GLP-1 RA 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020

(-3.96 mmol/L [-71.32 mg/dL] in the FRC group and -1.11 mmol/L [-19.99 mg/dL] in the GLP-1 RA 
group. There was a greater reduction from baseline in 2-hour plasma glucose excursion for the FRC 
compared to GLP-1 RA: -1.51 mmol/L (-27.20 mg/dL) in the FRC group and -0.52 mmol/L (-9.40 mg/dL) 
in the GLP-1 RA group. 
The percentage of patients who required rescue therapy was lower in the FRC group (4.8%) compared to 
the GLP-1 RA group (15.0%), with a risk difference of -10.00% (95% CI: -14.93%, -5.06%). 
To support the proposed extension of the indication to concomitant treatment with sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), data for a total of 115 patients treated simultaneously with SGLT2i 
and FRC in clinical trials (including data on 93 patients included in Japanese Phase 3 trials) have been 
provided. The outcome with regard to change in HbA1c was consistent across the different studies and 
comparable with the outcome for the overall study populations as previously described. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Of the 12 patients requiring rescue therapy in the FRC group, 11 had reached the 60 U dose. This fact 
demonstrates that some patients require a higher insulin dose than what can be managed by use of the 
FRC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile for the fixed combination of lixisenatide/insulin glargine in Study EFC13794 is similar to 
that of its components and in line with previous experience from FRC insulin glargine/lixisenatide clinical 
studies.  
The frequency of patients who had at least 1 TEAE was 64% in the FRC group and 47% in the GLP-1 RA 
group. Most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. The incidence of serious TEAEs was 3.9% in 
the FRC group and 3.5% in the GLP-1 RA group; however, none of the events were assessed as related, 
except for one SAE of severe hypoglycaemia in the FRC group. No deaths occurred in either study group 
during the trial.  
Nine patients (3.5%) discontinued permanently in the FRC group and no patients discontinued in the GLP-
1 RA group. Most patients (5 of 9) in the FRC group discontinued due to events of gastrointestinal 
disorders.  
The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was 33% in the FRC group and 4.3% the GLP1-RA group 
and the incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (≤3.9 mmol/L) was 28% and 2.3% for the 
FRC group and GLP-1 RA group, respectively. 
Events of any injection site reactions were frequently more common in the FRC group (2.0%; all non-
serious) than in the GLP-1 RA group (no event). 
Two events of allergic reactions (urticaria and asthma) were reported in two patients in the FRC group 
and no events in the GLP-1 RA group. Both events were adjudicated as of not related to the drug. 
One FRC-treated patient reported a pancreatic TEAE; however, adjudicated as a chronic pancreatitis and 
not related to FRC. 
During treatment, the incidence of AIA (anti-insulin antibodies)-positive patients increased from 2.1% to 
17% and ADA (anti-lixisenatide antibodies)-positive patients from 17% to 45%.   
The incidence of device-related events (such as device performance failure, confusing instructions or use 
error difficulty) was higher in the FRC-group (8.2%) compared with the GLP-1 RA group (2.0%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/82348/2020 
Page 52/56 
 
 
  
  
However, none of the events were associated with a clinical event (i.e. symptomatic hypoglycaemic 
event, hyperglycaemic AE or any other AE). 
Lipase values ≥3xULN increased similarly in the FRC group (2.0%) and GLP-1 RA group (2.4%). Amylase 
values ≥3 x ULN was reported in one patient (0.4%) in the FRC group and in no patients in the GLP-1 RA 
group. 
No relevant differences in the proportion of patients reporting TEAEs by age group were identified in 
either treatment group. 
To support the proposed extension of the indication to concomitant treatment with sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), data for a total of 115 patients treated simultaneously with SGLT2i 
and FRC in clinical trials (including data on 93 patients included in Japanese Phase 3 trials) have been 
provided. No safety concerns arise from the assessment of the safety data from these studies. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In summary, the safety profile of fixed combination of lixisenatide/insulin glargine is in line with findings 
from previous studies and no new safety concerns arise.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The change in HbA1c achieved by changing from GLP1-RA to Suliqua is clinically relevant and in line with 
other studies. The effect is similar across genders, age groups, ethnicity, independent of HbA1c or BMI at 
baseline. The study population was treated with a wide range of GLP1-RA, both short- and long-acting, 
supporting the validity of this treatment strategy. More patients in the FRC-group reached a level of 
HbA1c recommended by international health authorities in the field of diabetes, which in turn may result 
in fewer secondary complications. 
The observed increase in body weight is expected after the initiation of insulin treatment. As beta-cell 
function declines, insulin treatment may be the most suitable therapeutic option. The achievement of 
good metabolic control outweighs the possible consequences of increased body weight in this patient 
population. 
Suliqua is currently approved in combination with metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 
diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control when this has not been provided by metformin alone or 
metformin combined with another oral glucose lowering medicinal product or with basal insulin. The 
restriction to combination with metformin is due to the fact that all other OADs, as well as basal insulin, 
were discontinued at baseline in the pivotal studies supporting the initial MAA. 
With the current application, the MAH initially proposed to extend the indication to include concomitant 
treatment with other OADs than metformin (“as an adjunct to diet and exercise in addition to other oral 
medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes”). As this was not accepted by the CHMP due to a lack 
of, or very limited data, on the combination with other OADs than metformin, the MAH proposed during 
the procedure to include concomitant treatment with metformin and/or SGLT2i (“as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise in addition to metformin and/or SGLT-2 inhibitors”). The data supporting the extension to include 
the simultaneous use of SGLT2i is provided by study EFC13794, where 26 patients (10,1%) were treated 
with the FRC and SGLT2i. Further, the MAH has provided supplementary data from 93 patients treated 
with SGLT2i and FRC included in Japanese Phase 3 trials (34 patients (21.1%) from study EFC14112 and 
59 patients (22.7%) from Study EFC14114). The data from the clinical trials, albeit limited, are 
considered to support the efficacy and safety of the combination with SGLT2i. However, for clarity the 
final wording was amended as follows: “as an adjunct to diet and exercise in addition to metformin 
and/or with or without SGLT-2 inhibitors” 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
T2DM is a progressive disease, eventually leading to beta-cell burnout and the need for insulin 
replacement therapy. As the disease progresses, polypharmacy is inevitable, challenging compliance. 
Introduction of basal insulin therapy by means of the FRC offers a simple step towards improved 
metabolic control in this patient population, without the addition of a second subcutaneous injection. 
While body weight increases after the initiation of insulin treatment, this effect may be ameliorated by the 
concomitant use of GLP1-RA. Having a GLP1-RA with a post-prandial profile may even delay the need of 
prandial insulin. Hypoglycaemia remains a cornerstone of insulin treatment, especially prandial insulin. 
Postponing the initiation of prandial insulin may indeed limit the total risk for hypoglycaemia in this 
patient group. 
The current study shows that patients inadequately controlled with GLP1-RA on top of metformin may 
benefit from a change to the FRC Suliqua, achieving a better metabolic control, although being at risk of 
getting more hypoglycaemias and increasing in body weight. The FRC may improve compliance by

combining two drugs in the same subcutaneous injection. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance is 
considered positive in patients inadequately controlled with GLP1-RA.  
Limited efficacy and safety data from clinical trials have been provided to support the proposed extension 
of the indication to include concomitant treatment with metformin with or without SGLT-2 inhibitors, 
which are considered to support an extension of the indication to “in addition to metformin with or 
without SGLT-2 inhibitors”. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
An extension of the indication should preferably be supported/explained in section 5.1 of the SmPC and 
the MAH has proposed the following wording, which is considered acceptable: 
Concomitant use of Suliqua with SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) 
The concomitant use of Suliqua with SGLT2i is supported by subgroup analyses from three Phase 
3 randomized clinical trials (119 patients on the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio 
combination (FRC) who also received SGLT2i).  
One study conducted in Europe and North America included data from 26 patients (10.1%) who 
concomitantly received insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC, metformin and an SGLT2i. Two more 
Phase 3 studies from the dedicated Japanese clinical development program performed in patients 
not reaching sufficient glycaemic control on OADs provided data for 59 patients (22.7%) and 34 
patients (21.1%), respectively, who concomitantly received SGLT2i and insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide FRC. 
The data from these 3 studies show that initiation of Suliqua in patients inadequately controlled 
with a treatment including SGLT2i leads to improved change in HbA1c versus the comparators. 
There was no increased risk of hypoglycemia and no relevant differences in the overall safety 
profile in SGLT2i users compared to non-users. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Suliqua in “the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes 
mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise in addition to metformin with or 
without SGLT-2 inhibitors” is positive.

Extension of Indication to include “treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes 
mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise in addition to metformin with or 
without SGLT-2 inhibitors” based on the phase 3 Study EFC13794;  a 26-week randomized, open-label, 
active controlled, parallel-group, study assessing the efficacy and safety of the insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination in adults with Type 2 Diabetes inadequately controlled on 
GLP-1 receptor agonist and metformin (alone or with pioglitazone and/or SGLT-2 inhibitors), followed by 
a fixed ratio combination single-arm 26-week extension period. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the contact details of the 
local representatives in Denmark, the Netherlands and Malta in the Package Leaflet and to implement 
minor editorial changes in the annexes. An updated RMP version 4.1 was agreed during the procedure.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II, IIIA and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended.

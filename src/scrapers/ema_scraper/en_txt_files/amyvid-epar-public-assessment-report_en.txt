2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting approximately 
3.7 to 5.1 million people in the European Union (EU). The current standard of diagnosis based on the 
current internationally accepted standardized clinical criteria, however, has only a sensitivity and 
specificity of approximately 81% and 70%, respectively (Knopman et al. 2001). This is a considerable 
error margin if measured against the gold standard of diagnosis of AD on the basis of pathology: this can 
be made only after the patients’ death and includes autopsy histopathology (Mirra et al. 1991). 
Diagnosis and treatment opportunities of AD have been hampered by the absence of reliable, non-
invasive markers for its underlying pathology. Given the limitations regarding both accuracy of an AD 
diagnosis and early identification of AD, a reliable biomarker could increase the validity of a clinical 
Amyvid
Assessment report

Page 7/78
diagnosis of AD and reduce the frequency of false positive diagnoses by documenting the presence or 
absence of AD-associated pathological changes. 
Recently, the use of AD pathology biomarkers has been included in the new consensus diagnostic 
guidelines for AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) proposed by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) 
and the Alzheimer’s Association. Whereas the original NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., 1984) 
assumed that AD is a clinical-pathological entity, the new criteria take into account that AD dementia is 
part of a continuum of clinical and biological phenomena (McKhann et al., 2011). Accordingly, in the 
revised NIA-Alzheimer’s Association criteria, a semantic and conceptual distinction is made between the 
AD pathophysiological process (AD-P) and the clinical manifestation (AD-C) (Jack et al., 2011, Dubois et 
al., 2010). This distinction should be carefully considered when the role of biomarkers is evaluated.
Neither new diagnostic criteria nor potential biomarkers have yet been validated for diagnostic purposes 
in the context of AD.  The best ways to diagnose, stage and follow AD premortem, are matters being 
actively debated in the scientific literature and consensus has not yet been reached.  Controversy also 
exists on the validity of certain diagnosis referring to cognitive impairment in its pre-dementia stages.  
It is not yet settled if mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as an episodic memory impaired group, is an 
intermediate stage that a patient with AD will pass through before becoming demented.  On the other 
hand, the concept of minimal cognitive impairment (as defined by the Petersen Criteria 2003) or the 
prodromal AD (as defined by Dubois Criteria 2007) reflects a different population.
Recently the CHMP published a number of qualification opinions on the use of biomarkers in the context 
of AD 1. These are to be used solely to identify subjects with clinical diagnosis of predementia at 
increased risk of underlying AD neuropathology or to identify patients with clinical diagnosis of mild to 
moderate AD, for the purposes of enriching recruitment into clinical trials aimed at studying drugs 
potentially slowing the progression/conversion to (severe) AD dementia of the included patients, but not 
for its use as a diagnostic tool or as an outcome or longitudinal measure.
Aβ peptide, as β-amyloid fibrils, and neuritic β-amyloid plaques are a defining component of the 
neuropathological criteria for autopsy-based diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The amyloid cascade 
hypothesis suggests that accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) is the key pathological step in the pathogenesis 
of AD (Karran et al 2011). However, imperfect correlation between cognitive status and Aβ deposits in 
brain have been described (Golde at al., 2011), as amyloid deposition can occur as well in normal aging 
(Davis et al., 1999; Price et al., 1999; Knopman et al., 2003; Aizenstein et al., 2008) and amyloid 
pathology has been observed in autopsy brains of older persons without dementia (Bennett et al., 2006).
β-amyloid plaques may also be present in patients with MCI, with other dementias (dementia of Lewy 
Body, Parkinson disease dementia), Niemann-Pick disease type C, and severe brain injury.  
This has led to the view that Aβ is only one of the factors that causes AD and that other non Aβ factors 
also contribute to AD (Pimplikar et al., 2009).
Indeed, pre-specified levels of age-related brain neuritic  β-amyloid plaques at autopsy should be 
integrated with the presence of a clinical history of dementia to arrive at a diagnostic level of certainty 
with regard to AD (Mirra et al. 1991). Although neuritic plaques are a common factor for the post-
mortem definitive diagnosis of the disease, the diagnostic value of different brain β-amyloid plaque types 
(diffuse plaques with pre-amyloid, neuritic and cored), as well as of different β-amyloid isoforms/species 
(oligomeric, fibrillar or non-fibrillar) may well be different.
Both the degree of β-amyloid deposition, but also its neuroanatomical localization is obviously important 
for determination of β-amyloid-related pathology in the brain. The characteristic pattern of deposition for

different stages of typical AD is well-known (Braak et al. 1994).  The regional pattern of β-amyloid 
accumulation is different in typical AD (Edison et al. 2007) compared to other pathological entities that 
present amyloid deposition.
Only a portion of patients with MCI progress to clinical AD dementia over 5-10 years (Petersen et al., 
1999; Ritchie et al., 2001; Visser et al., 2006; Mitchell et al., 2009) and a recent meta-analysis 
concluded that most people with MCI will not progress to dementia even after 10 years of follow-up 
(Klunk et al., 2011). In a longitudinal study of 143 MCI cases followed for 4 or more years 43% 
developed clinical AD, 42% remained cognitively stable and 15% developed other dementias (mostly 
vascular) (Hansson et al., 2006). Two community-based studies have shown over one-third of patients 
diagnosed with MCI at baseline may return to normal cognition (Ganguli et al., 2004; Larrieu et al., 
2002).
It is agreed that it would be of great value to be able to predict which patients, who upon comprehensive 
diagnostic testing are found to have cognitive impairment but are not demented and thus do not meet 
diagnostic criteria for AD (e.g. patients with MCI), are destined to progress to a clinical diagnosis of AD 
dementia. In this context there is an unmet medical need for non-invasive methods for assessing Aβ 
pathology in vivo.
About the product
Florbetapir (18F) is a novel radiopharmaceutical agent which has been developed for imaging β-amyloid 
neuritic plaques in the human brain by PET. Florbetapir (18F) binds with high affinity and specificity to Aβ 
aggregates in brain tissue homogenates from patients with AD.
PET was chosen as the most suitable imaging modality for imaging β-amyloid because of its superior 
resolution and sensitivity compared to other Nuclear Medicine techniques, and because of the promising 
results for PET imaging of Aβ reported in the literature (Klunk, 2004; Nordberg, 2004). Fluorine (18F) was 
chosen over other positron-emitting isotopes because of its ease for incorporation into potential ligands 
and well established use in current PET clinical practice. Fluorine (18F) has a longer radioactive half-life 
(110 minutes) than carbon (11C) and regional preparation and shipping of fluorine (18F) labelled doses is 
both possible and practical (as demonstrated by fludeoxyglucose (18F)), thus making florbetapir (18F) PET 
imaging of Aβ potentially available to imaging centres across the EU.
2.2.  Quality aspects

for imaging β-amyloid neuritic plaques in the human brain by PET.
The finished product is presented as solution for injection containing 800 MBq/ml of florbetapir (18F) and 
1900 MBq/ml of florbetapir (18F) at the date and time of calibration. The composition is described in 
section 6.1. of the SmPC.
The product is available in clear Type I borosilicate glass vials with FluroTec-coated chlorobutyl 
elastomeric closures and aluminium overseals.  Each vial is enclosed in a shielded container of 
appropriate thickness to minimise external radiation exposure.
2.2.2.  Active Substance
According to Guideline on Radiopharmaceuticals information on chemical precursors including those for 
synthesis of PET radiopharmaceuticals is presented in a separate section. Such section is submitted and 
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 9/78
elaborated by the precursor (AV-105) manufacturer. The submitted data assures an adequate quality of 
this chemical precursor.
Florbetapir (18F) is a small organic chemical substance containing fluorine-18. The active substance is 
characterized by radiochemical identity, radiochemical purity, volumic activity, radionuclidic identity and 
radionuclidic purity.
The chemical name is (E)-4-(2-(6-(2-(2-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)pyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-N-
methylaniline, alternative: Benzenamine, 4-[(1E)-2-[6-[2-[2-[2-(fluoro-18F)ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]-3-
pyridinyl]ethenyl]-N-methyl4-[(1E)-2-[6-[2-[2-[2-(fluoro-18F)ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]-3-
pyridinyl]ethenyl]-N-methyl- and has the following structural formula:
Florbetapir 18F, contains the radioactive isotope fluorine-18 (F-18). F-18 undergoes radioactive decay 
primarily through emission of a positively-charged beta particle having maximum and average energies 
of 635 and 249 keV respectively. The half-life of F-18 is 109.77 minutes. 
Manufacture
The active substance (Florbetapir (18F)) is not isolated during the manufacturing process. Active 
substance and Finished Product (Florbetapir (18F) Solution for Injection) are manufactured in one 
continuous process. One manufacturing process is used at all manufacturing sites. 
The Florbetapir 18F manufacturing process is standardized across all manufacturing sites, with minor 
changes at each site in order to be consistent with local manufacturing operations. However, because 
active substance and finished product are manufactured in one continuous process, process validation is 
performed on the active substance/finished product process together.
Specification
The active substance is not isolated during the manufacturing process. Therefore, information on 
specification is provided in the finished product section.
Stability
The active substance is not isolated during the manufacturing process. Therefore, information on stability 
is provided in the finished product section.
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product
Pharmaceutical Development
The formulation was developed to be compatible with intravenous administration, to contain simple, safe 
and European pharmacopoeial quality excipients, to solubilise the lipophilic active substance, to allow 
sterilization of the finished product by filtration and to protect the active substance from the effects of 
radiolysis.
Two volumic activities were developed, 1900 MBq/ml and 800 MBq/ml in order to obtain the maximum 
shelf-life and to ensure an injection volume of not less than 1 ml at times shortly after the end of 
synthesis.
Florbetapir (18F) Solution for Injection formulation contains simple and safe European pharmacopoeial 
excipients: ethanol, sodium ascorbate, and sodium chloride. Ethanol solubilises the active substance and 
the used concentration is suitable for intravenous injection, sodium ascorbate protects the active 
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 10/78
substance from the effects of radiolysis and sodium chloride is used as isotonic agent. The aseptic steps 
of the manufacture of the finished product are the assembly of the intermediate and bulk product vials, 
the sterile filtration of the finished product and diluent and the dispensing of the quality control vials and 
multi-dose vials. Sterile filtration was chosen instead of terminal sterilization using an autoclave as the 
finished product is not stable to the conditions for terminal sterilization using autoclave. 
The primary packaging proposed is Type I glass vials; a compatibility study was performed to evaluate 
the compatibility of Florbetapir 18F Solution for Injection with the container closure system.
Adventitious agents
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.
Manufacture of the product
The active substance and the finished product (Florbetapir (18F) Solution for Injection) are manufactured 
in one continuous process in which the active substance is produced using a radiosynthesizer, formulated, 
and sterile filtered to form the finished product. The active substance (Florbetapir (18F)) is not isolated 
during the manufacturing process. However, the manufacturing steps comprise the manufacture of 
Florbetapir (18F) and its preparation as a solution in the finished product matrix. The steps in the finished 
Product manufacturing process begins in the radiosynthesiser with the last elution step of the active 
substance from solid phase purification using an excipient solution to gain the active substance in solution 
as an intermediate of the finished product and result in the finished product after dispensing in multi-
dose Vials. The dispensing step is performed in a Class A environment, comprising sterile filtration of the 
intermediate solution and final formulation (dilution with sterile filtered diluent).
The manufacturing process has been validated by a number of studies for the major steps of the 
manufacturing process and has been demonstrated to be capable and to be able to reproducibly produce 
finished product of the intended quality. The in process controls are adequate for this 
radiopharmaceutical preparation.
The batch analysis data on 3 manufacturing batches at each manufacturing site shows that the product 
can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification.
Product specification
The finished product prior to release specifications include appropriate tests for appearance, pH, volumic 
activity, radionuclidic identity by half life (radioactive half life), radionuclidic identity by gamma energy 
emission (MCA), radiochemical identity by comparison to external florbetapir F19 Reference standard 
(Radiometric and UV HPLC), radiochemical purity (radiometric, HPLC), radiochemical impurities 
(radiometric, HPLC), chemical impurities (UV-HPLC), florbetapir 19F concentration (UV-HPLC), assay of 
sodium ascorbate (reflectance photometry), assay of ethanol (GC), residual solvents (GC), cryptand 222 
(colorimetry), filter integrity (13 mm for finished product and 33 mm filter for diluent), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph Eur). The specifications post release are sterility (Ph Eur) and radionuclidic purity (gamma 
spectroscopy).
Batch analysis results confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is 
capable and under control.

Stability of the product
Stability data were presented for 9 production scale batches stored at room temperature for up 10 hours 
in multi-dose vials manufactured at a manufacturing site within each contract manufacturing 
organization. Additional supporting stability studies were performed to assess the stability of florbetapir 
(18F) solution for Injection. These additional studies were: stability study of florbetapir (18F) solution for 
injection in upright and inverted vials at room temperature (25°C± 2 °C) and accelerated condition 
(40°C± 2 °C), stability study of florbetapir (18F) solution for injection in 10 ml and 50 ml vials at room 
temperature, stability study of florbetapir (18F) solution for injection stored as a whole batch volume, 
shipping stability study and stress stability (hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide, high temperature 
(90°C) and full spectrum light). A stability study was also performed to evaluate the stability of 
florbetapir (18F) solution for injection at the lower concentration (800 MBq/mL) stored in multi-dose vials 
stored at room temperature.  This study demonstrates that florbetapir (18F) solution for injection 
manufactured at the minimum concentration is stable for the defined shelf –life when stored at room 
temperature.
Samples in the stability studies were tested for appearance, pH, volumic activity, radiochemical identity 
radiochemical purity radiochemical impurities, chemical impurities, florbetapir 19F concentration, and 
assay of sodium ascorbate.
All studies support that Florbetapir (18F) Solution for Injection is stable for 10 hours.
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable.
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development
Not applicable
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Pharmacology
Binding of florbetapir 18F to its intended target, β-amyloid, has been characterized in nonclinical studies 
on brain tissue sections and homogenates from human subjects with pathologically verified diagnoses of 
neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. The data obtained in these primary pharmacodynamic studies 
indicate that florbetapir 18F selectively binds to and labels β-amyloid in human brain tissue and, 
furthermore, that the binding intensity of florbetapir 18F is quantitatively correlated with the density of β-
amyloid measured by standard neuropathological techniques. The Kd for the binding of florbetapir 18F to 
its target, β-amyloid, was measured at 3.7± 0.3 nM. Extensive counter screening on known drug

receptors and binding sites has not identified any other binding site for florbetapir 18F at up to 1000-fold 
higher concentrations.
There is accumulating evidence that soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers, rather than amyloid fibrils, are the 
principal pathogenic species in Alzheimer disease. It is not known if florbetapir (18F) binds to different 
types of β-amyloid plaque other than neuritic plaque and to different forms of β-amyloid. However, taking 
into account that the binding of florbetapir (18F) to neuritic Aβ plaque has been demonstrated by the 
applicant in preclinical in vitro studies, and considering the therapeutic indication, the knowledge of the 
florbetapir (18F) binding to other different types of Aβ plaque may not be imperative.
The first safety pharmacology study consisted of the testing of florbetapir against a panel of 46 CNS and 
cardiovascular receptor binding sites from various species. florbetapir bound weakly to the rat peripheral 
benzodiazepine receptor and the rabbit vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2), although the 
affinity for these targets was 1000 times lower than for β-amyloid.
Further safety pharmacology evaluations of florbetapir 18F did not reveal any undesired off-target 
activities. Standardized behavioural studies in rats did not reveal any effects up to and including the 
highest dose tested, which corresponded to 25 times the maximum human dose (MHD). Specific 
nonclinical in vitro tests on hERG channels and in vivo evaluations in dogs for potential adverse effects on 
the cardiovascular and respiratory system did not reveal any  effects up to and including the highest dose 
level tested (100 times the MHD). Nonclinical radiation safety studies identified a radiation risk similar to 
that of the approved PET imaging agent 18F-FDG. Pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies 
conducted in vitro did not identify any drugs commonly used in the elderly or prescribed for AD patients, 
or any experimental AD drugs, which may be able to interfere with florbetapir 18F binding to its intended 
target, β-amyloid.
No secondary pharmacodynamics evaluation is considered necessary.
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics
Nonclinical studies on absorption were not conducted. Florbetapir 18F is administered intravenously and is 
therefore 100% bioavailable.
Nonclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism studies with florbetapir 18F showed a profile suitable for its 
intended use as a single-dose IV injectable radiopharmaceutical. Following IV injection in mice and 
monkeys, florbetapir 18F rapidly entered the brain and quickly washed out from the brain. It was swiftly 
transformed to two major desmethylated metabolites, which did not show any significant binding affinity 
to β-amyloid. Thus it is unlikely that metabolites of florbetapir 18F will affect its binding to β-amyloid. In
vitro metabolism studies using liver microsomes did not reveal any species- or gender-specific differences 
in metabolism of florbetapir 18F.
No nonclinical data on the excretion of florbetapir 18F were collected. Whole body distribution of 18F from 
florbetapir 18F injection was studied in humans via whole body PET imaging. The primary route of 
excretion is through the hepatobiliary system. Based on the short radioactive half-life and the low mass 
of florbetapir 18F that is administered, the quantitation of 18F collected in urine and faeces was considered 
impractical and of limited meaning.
2.3.3.  Toxicology
The toxicity of florbetapir 19F (the non radioactive version of florbetapir 18F) was evaluated in single and 
repeat-dose studies under GLP conditions.

Single dose toxicity
In the single dose study, conducted in rats, the animals received 50 and 100 times the MHD, 
respectively. Half of the animals were necropsied 2 days after dosing, and half of them were allowed to 
recover for 14 days. The study endpoints included clinical observations, ophthalmology, haematology, 
clinical chemistry, food consumption, body weight, gross pathology, and histopathology. There were no 
adverse effects observed in any of the groups. Based on all observations including histopathology, the no 
observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was determined to be equal to or greater than the highest dose 
level tested, ie, ≥ 448 μg/kg or ≥ 100 times the intended MHD of 50 μg/70 kg.
Repeat dose toxicity
The potential toxicity of AV-45 after repeated dose was investigated in rats over 28 days. The animals 
(10 males/10 females in each dose group) were given 5, 12.5 and 25 times the MHD, respectively. 
5 animals of each group were necropsied the day after the last dosing, the others were allowed to 
recover for 14 days. There were no adverse effects observed in any of the groups, so that the NOAEL in 
rats was determined to be be equal to or greater than the highest dose level tested, ie, ≥112 μg/kg/day 
for the 28- day repeated dose (≥ 25 times the MHD of 50 μg/70 kg.
Repeated administration of AV-45 was further investigated in a 14 day and a 28 day study in the dog.
In the 14 day study the dogs (6 males, 6 females in each dose group) received 5, 10 or 25 times the 
intended MDH. Half of the animals were necropsied the day after the last dose, the remaining ones were 
allowed to recover for 14 days. Since there was variability in the concentration of the formulated test 
article, the NOAEL was thus calculated based on the lowest results of the dose verification analysis and 
estimated to be ≥11.2 μg/kg/day corresponding to ≥8.7 times the MHD.
In the 28 day study the dog (6 males, 6 females of each dose group) were given 8.7 and 25 times the 
MHD, respectively. Half of the animals were sacrificed at the end of the treatment, the others after a 
recovery period of 14 day. There were no test article-related changes in any of the parameters evaluated 
during the study, except of some statistically significant but clinically minor increases in monocytes, 
fibrinogen, and globulin observed after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in both sexes. They did not correlate 
with inflammatory processes by light microscopy and did not show a consistent dose- or time-
relationship. They were, thus, not considered clinically relevant. In this study the NOAEL was determined 
to be equal or greater than 25 times the MHD.
Carcinogenicity
No studies on carcinogenicity have been performed with florbetapir, which is considered acceptable 
regarding the intended diagnostic use.
Genotoxicity
Potential genotoxicity was tested in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Bacterial reverse mutation assay 
results showed positive responses in 2 out of 5 tested strains. The HPL chromosomal aberration assay 
showed no statistically significant test-article–related increases in the percent of cells with structural 
aberrations after 3 hours of exposure, but a statistically significant positive result was seen after 22 hours 
of exposure. In the in vivo micronucleus assay, AV-45 produced no evidence of genotoxicity when 
administered at doses up to the highest practically-achievable dose (83 times the MHD) for 3 consecutive 
days. The different results in the in vitro bacterial mutation and chromosome aberration assays and the 
in vivo micronucleus study are likely related to differences in the exposure conditions encountered by the
target cells in the different test systems. In vivo, AV-45 is cleared rapidly; however, the in vitro 
Amyvid
Assessment report

experiments employ static, prolonged exposure of cells to high concentrations of the test article. The 3-
hour incubation is substantially longer than the in vivo exposure, due to the rapid clearance of florbetapir 
18F from circulation, providing an adequate margin of safety with respect to potential genotoxicity.
AV-45 is positive in vitro in bacteria for mutation induction and in mammalian cells for clastogenic 
damage. It was negative in the in vivo test in rats. Exposure in vivo is low as no signs of toxicity were 
seen at the highest dose. Given that florbetapir (18F) is expected to be administered in single doses at 
very low quantities and its short circulating half-time, the genotoxicity risk for this product is considered 
to be low.
Reproduction Toxicity
It was not considered necessary to undertake reproductive toxicology studies for florbetapir, because of 
the target population of elderly male or post-menopausal females patients, additionally a single dose of 
this rapidly excreted molecule will be administered, and exposure of reproductive organs is limited. 
It is extremely unlikely that a pregnant woman would undergo a scan with AV-45, given that the 
intended population is primarily aged >50 years. However, appropriate statements are included in the 
SmPC, based on the recommendations in the CHMP core SmPC for radiopharmaceuticals.
Toxicokinetic data
In the clinical studies there are not metabolites at exposures >10% of total drug-related exposures, with 
metabolites present in circulation at levels of ~4.6% of the original injected 18F dose after the first five 
minutes following injection, with each individual metabolite present at <2% of the original injected dose. 
Therefore, no additional nonclinical characterization is necessary.
Other toxicity studies
No other toxicity studies eg in juvenile animals or on immunotoxicity have been conducted. This is 
acceptable because of the intended clinical use and the results of the pharmacological and toxicological 
investigations.

The applicant has provided an environmental risk assessment according to Phase I of 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00. The PEC surface water according to the guideline is calculated to be 2.5 x 10-
4  µg/L. As this value is below the action limit a Phase II environmental risk assessment has not been 
conducted. The logKow is given as 3.36. Measurements at a range of different pH values were used to 
calculate the log Kow for the neutral species. This value is representative for the environmentally relevant 
pH range. According to EMEA/CHMP/SWP/ERA/4447/00 in general a study according to OECD 107 or 122 
would be required, however, due to the very low predicted exposure and the special nature of the active 
ingredient the presented information is considered acceptable.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
The non-clinical pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies conducted 
with florbetapir 18F and its non radioactive analog florbetapir 19F (or AV-45) have shown that florbetapir 
18F binds with high affinity and selectivity to its intended target, the β-amyloid plaques in the brain of 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and has a high margin of safety in animal toxicological studies. It meets 
the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic requirements for a PET pharmaceutical for the visualisation of 
β-amyloid plaques.
The absence of substantial parts of classical parts of pharmacology and toxicology (eg toxicokinetics, 
reproduction toxicology, carcinogenicity) is justified because of the intented clinical use of florbetapir 18F: 
the administration of a single very low dose in elderly patients.
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
The potential toxicity of florbetapir 18F was tested in rats with single acute doses up to 100 fold the 
maximum human dose (50 μg for a 70 kg person) and up to 28 days of repeated doses up to 25 times 
the maximum human dose in beagle dogs. In none of these studies significant adverse effects were 
observed with regard to clinical observation, weight changes, clinical chemistry, gross pathology and 
histopathology. In each rat and dog study conducted, the NOAEL was determined to be equal or higher 
than the highest dose.
Florbetapir is positive in vitro in bacteria for mutation induction and in mammalian cells for clastogenic 
damage. It was negative in the in vivo test in rats. Exposure in vivo is low as no signs of toxicity were 
seen at the highest dose. However considering the maximum therapeutic dose of 50 µg the highest dose 
tested in vivo with 372 µg/kg/d seems to be high enough to provide a sufficient level of safety.
No reproductive and developmental toxicity or carcinogenicity evaluations were conducted, given the 
intended single-dose use of the drug product and the age of the patient group in which it will be used.
2.4.  Clinical aspects
GCP
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.
2.4.1.  Introduction
The development programme of florbetapir (18F) focused on three main areas of investigation: correlation 
of florbetapir (18F) PET image uptake with histopathology assays at autopsy, diagnostic performance, and 
impact on diagnostic thinking. The number of patients exposed to at least one dose of florbetapir (18F) 
during six clinical trials was 496 subjects. The clinical trial programme conducted by the company 
included 13 completed clinical studies:

Four phase 1 studies (A01, A02, A03, A04) evaluating radiation exposure and dosimetry, tracer 
time course, optimal dose, and test-retest reliability.

One phase 2 study (A05) evaluating the efficacy (diagnostic performance) to differentiate healthy 
controls from subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AD or MCI
Amyvid


Two pivotal phase 3 studies (A07, A16) confirmatively evaluating the efficacy (diagnostic 
performance) and safety using histopathology as the standard of truth. The remaining six studies (A11, 
A13, A08, A09, A06 and PT01) enrolled no new patients, but consisted of extended follow-up of 
patients or re-analysis/re-read of images from subjects enrolled and imaged in the other seven studies.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics
Absorption, Distribution, Elimination
Following intravenous administration florbetapir (18F) is rapidly cleared and metabolized so that only 
around 5% of the original dose is present in circulation at 5 minutes: 18F is distributed primarily to the 
liver and brain, approximately 1% of is present at 20 minutes and less than 0.5% by 45 minutes post-
administration. 
As the quantity of florbetapir in the blood during the terminal phase is too low to be accurately measured, 
and due to rapid clearance, the terminal half-life has not been calculated. The primary route of clearance 
from circulation is through the liver, followed by GI excretion. A low amount of 18F (< 5%) accumulates in 
the urinary bladder in the form of more polar metabolites of florbetapir (18F) and is eliminated in the 
urine. 
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 20/78
Dose proportionality and time dependencies
The stable brain SUVR image results in AD patients that were seen in Studies A01 and A03 after 
30 minutes following dose administration are consistent with the lack of effect of the very low levels of 
metabolites in the circulation over the imaging period of 30-90 minutes post-injection. The radiation 
dosimetry is similar to approved PET drugs like fludeoxyglucose (18F) and is not substantially affected by 
patient weight. The radioactive half-life of (18F) is approximately 110 minutes. The biological half-life of 
florbetapir has not been determined. 
Special populations
Due to rapid brain uptake of florbetapir (18F) and rapid clearance of the compound from circulation and 
the microdose applied, the omission of pharmacokinetic studies in special populations with hepatic or 
renal impairment is justified. However the respective standard text from the Radiopharmaceuticals Core 
SmPC is included in the SmPC for safety reasons. No use is expected in children.
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics
Florbetapir (18F) is administered in doses no higher than 50 µg and does not have any detectable 
pharmacological activity.
In a dose comparison study, the brain uptake and distribution of florbetapir (18F) was investigated in 2 
different dose groups (111 MBq and 370 MBq). Based on the improvement in the visual image quality 
ratings and acceptable radiation dose observed, a dose of 370 MBq was chosen as the standard dose for 
clinical application, and this was the dose level selected for use in all subsequent clinical studies.
The time course of florbetapir (18F) brain uptake was investigated in two studies in which the standardized 
uptake value ratio of target cortical brain regions versus cerebellum (SUVR) was greater in subjects with 
AD compared with cognitively healthy control subjects (HC). The average cortical to cerebellar SUVR 
values showed a continual substantial increase from time zero through 30 minutes post-administration, 
with only small changes thereafter, reaching asymptote by 50 minutes. There were no clinically 
significant differences in SUVR for images acquired at time points between 30 and 90 minutes post-
injection for AD and HC subjects, and this is therefore the supposed optimal time window for image 
acquisition.
The correlation of florbetapir (18F) binding to β-amyloid deposition was investigated in three in vitro
studies in brain tissue from 64 subjects with a pathological diagnosis of AD, other neurological diseases, 
or healthy control subjects. It was confirmed that florbetapir (18F) binds to and labels β-amyloid in human 
brain tissue. There was also a correlation between florbetapir (18F) binding measured by autoradiography 
and the density of β-amyloid measured by immunohistochemical assays. 
In the pivotal study A16 in 59 end-of-life patients whose cognitive impairment status was not accurately 
settled, a positive correlation (=0.76; 95%CI:0.62 to 0.85) was demonstrated between the in vivo
florbetapir (18F) uptake in cortical grey matter (the mean of the 5-point semiquantitative visual PET rating 
measured by three independent readers) and the total β-amyloid burden averaged from six particular 
cortical regions (anterior cingulate and frontal cortex, temporal cortex, posterior cingulate, precuneus and 
lateral parietal cortex) using 4G8 anti-amyloid antibody that stains β-amyloid found in both neuritic and 
diffuse plaques.

The binding of florbetapir (18F) to other β-amyloid structures (such as cored, vascular or soluble) or to 
other brain structures (neurofibrillary tangles, other amyloid structures, etc.) has not been assessed in 
vivo. 
18F in vivo uptake (radioactivity accumulation) was found in some extracerebral structures in the head 
(scalp, salivary glands, muscles and cranial bone) in some cases of the electronic training programme 
(case 103, 108, 112, 113 and others). The reason for that extracerebral uptake (if due to accumulation of 
florbetapir (18F) or to any of its radioactive metabolites or to blood radioactivity) is unknown but the 
company has stated that residual 18F blood activity at the time of the scan may contribute to the signal.
Uptake in these structures might be located in the same transverse slice in which cortical uptake should 
be interpreted in florbetapir (18F) PET images, and then might interfere with image interpretation. 
Therefore, a wording in the SmPC was proposed to reflect this.
It was demonstrated that there is β-amyloid deposition in the frontal lobe and a comparison of a 
florbetapir (18F) PET scan with a Pittsburgh compound B scan clearly shows the same distribution pattern 
in the frontal lobe with both compounds.
The observed residual activity found in white matter is considered to be linked to the regional cerebral 
blood flow in white matter, which is likely to contribute to slower radiotracer washout from the white 
matter relative to the grey matter. Even in healthy control subjects a characteristic white matter pattern 
of the PET image is observed. However, the grey matter retention is at least threefold higher than the 
white matter retention on the PET images of subjects with AD pathology, and this is the rationale for the 
visual binary read methodology.
For the time being, the binary method rating method of florbetapir-PET imaging is considered to be 
robust in different clinical settings but the CHMP proposed to develop the quantitative method further.
As cerebral amyloid angiopathy primarily shows up in the occipital lobe, which is one of the lowest 
neocortical sites of Aβ radiotracer retention in subjects with AD pathology interference with cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy is not suspected.
A wording was included in the SmPC section 5.2:
Healthy controls show relatively low levels of florbetapir (18F) retention in cortex and cerebellum. 
Regional analyses show slightly higher levels of retention in the caudate, putamen and hippocampus. The 
highest level of uptake is in regions mainly composed of white matter (pons and centrum semiovale). In 
AD subjects, cortical regions and putamen show significantly greater uptake compared to controls. In AD 
subjects, as in controls, there is low retention in cerebellum and hippocampus and high retention in pons 
and centrum semiovale.
The biophysical basis of the white matter retention of florbetapir (18F) in the living human brain cannot 
be definitively explained. It is hypothesized that slower clearance of the radiopharmaceutical may 
contribute to white matter retention since regional cerebral blood flow in white matter is less than half of 
that of cortex. Uptake has also  been identified in some cases in extracerebral structures such as scalp, 
salivary glands, muscles and cranial bone.  
The reason for this uptake is unknown, but may be due to accumulation of florbetapir (18F) or to any of 
its radioactive metabolites or to blood radioactivity.
Given that the maximum concentration of cold florbetapir (19F) in the average human brain is about 100 
fold less than the target concentration of labeled florbetapir (18F), there is a very low potential for 
substantial competitive binding between 19F and 18F forms of florbetapir to be expected in patients with 
AD pathology.
There is no evidence for any influence of clinical symptoms on the target’s binding properties.

The test-retest reproducibility of florbetapir (18F) PET imaging was investigated in two imaging sessions 
which were less than 4 weeks apart. SUVRs were highly repeatable between test and retest image results 
for AD and HC subjects indicating a high degree of test-retest reproducibility.
Due to rapid brain uptake of florbetapir (18F) and rapid clearance of the compound from circulation and 
the microdose applied, influence of hepatic or renal impairment on the florbetapir F18 safety is not 
suspected and the omission of pharmacokinetic studies in special populations with hepatic or renal 
impairment is justified. However the respective standard text from the Radiopharmaceuticals Core SmPC 
is included in the SmPC for safety reasons.
A comparison of florbetapir (18F) PET with alternative techniques in the field as CSF sampling for 
determination of β-amyloid and tau, volumetric MRI of the medial temporal lobe/hippocampus and 
fludeoxyglucose (18F) PET shows that florbetapir (18F)  is the only direct measure of a defining 
pathological feature of AD pathology in situ, the presence of amyloid accumulation in the brain whereas 
the other modalities provide rather indirect measurements (fludeoxyglucose (18F) ), are invasive (CSF 
sampling) or are not unequivocal in determining AD (Volumetric MRI).
Interaction studies
Potential pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions with a number of drugs belonging to classes that may 
be frequently used by elderly patients have been evaluated in vitro using tissue binding assays and in 
vitro film autoradiography (see section “Non clinical aspects”). There were no drug-drug interaction 
effects on florbetapir (18F)  cortical brain binding found in AD subjects taking acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors or the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine which represent the current available 
therapeutical options for AD.
No in vivo pharmacodynamics drug-drug interaction studies have been performed.
Mechanism of action
Amyloid ß (Aß) neuritic plaques are a defining neuropathology of AD.  Florbetapir (18F) binds to Aß 
neuritic plaques, and the 18F isotope produces a positron signal that is detected by a PET scanner.
The correlation of florbetapir (18F) binding to β-amyloid deposition was investigated in three in vitro
studies in brain tissue from 64 subjects with a pathological diagnosis of AD, other neurological diseases, 
or healthy control subjects. It was confirmed that florbetapir (18F) binds to and labels β-amyloid in human 
brain tissue. These in vitro studies were part of the pre-clinical studies, and are described in that section 
of the assessment report.  There was also a correlation between florbetapir (18F) binding measured by 
autoradiography and the density of β-amyloid measured by immunohistochemical assays.   
In the pivotal study A16 in 59 end-of-life patients whose cognitive impairment status was difficult to 
determine, correlation (=0.76; 95%CI:0.62 to 0.85) was obtained between the in vivo florbetapir (18F) 
uptake in cortical grey matter (the mean of the 5-point semiquantitative visual PET rating measured by 
three independent readers) and the total β-amyloid burden averaged from six particular cortical regions 
(anterior cingulate and frontal cortex, temporal cortex, posterior cingulate, precuneus and lateral parietal 
cortex) using 4G8 anti-amyloid antibody that stains β-amyloid found in both neuritic and diffuse plaques.
The binding of florbetapir (18F) to other β-amyloid structures or to other brain structures or receptors has 
not been assessed in vivo.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology
In a dose comparison study (study A03 detailed in section 2.5.1), the brain uptake and distribution of 
florbetapir (18F) was investigated in 2 different dose groups (111 MBq and 370 MBq). Based on the 
improvement in the visual image quality ratings and acceptable radiation dose observed, a dose of 370 
MBq was chosen as the standard dose for clinical application, and this was the dose level selected for use 
in all subsequent clinical studies.
The time course of florbetapir (18F) brain uptake was investigated in study A01 in which the standardized 
uptake value ratio of target cortical brain regions versus cerebellum (SUVR) was greater in the 16 
recruited subjects with AD compared with the 16 recruited cognitively healthy control subjects (HC).  
The target regions were precuneus, frontal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, parietal and temporal.  
The average cortical to cerebellar SUVR values showed a continual substantial increase from time zero 
through 30 minutes post-administration, with only small changes thereafter, reaching asymptote by 50 
minutes. There were no clinically significant differences in SUVR for images acquired at time points 
between 30 and 90 minutes post-injection for AD and HC subjects, and this is therefore the supposed 
optimal time window for image acquisition.
Study A04 was designed to evaluate test-retest reliability of florbetapir (18F) PET imaging in two 
imaging sessions. Fifteen AD subjects and 10 healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. At each 
of two imaging sessions, less than 4 weeks apart, subjects were injected with a single IV bolus of 370 
MBq of florbetapir (18F). Approximately 50 minutes after the injection of florbetapir (18F), the subject 
received a 20 minute continuous dynamic PET scan.  SUVRs were highly repeatable between test and 
retest image results for AD and HC subjects indicating a high degree of test-retest reproducibility.
No clinical data on secondary pharmacology are available.
It was demonstrated that there is β-amyloid deposition in the frontal lobe and a comparison of a 
florbetapir (18F) PET scan with a Pittsburgh compound B scan clearly shows the same distribution pattern 
in the frontal lobe with both compounds.
The observed residual activity found in white matter is considered to be linked to the regional cerebral 
blood flow in white matter, which is likely to contribute to slower radiotracer washout from the white 
matter relative to the grey matter. Even in healthy control subjects a characteristic white matter pattern 
of the PET image is observed. However, the grey matter retention is at least threefold higher than the 
white matter retention on the PET images of subjects with AD pathology, and this is the rationale for the 
visual binary read methodology.
White matter retention of florbetapir (18F) was adressed by a wording included in the SmPC:
“Healthy controls show relatively low levels of florbetapir (18F) retention in cortex and cerebellum. 
Regional analyses show slightly higher levels of retention in the caudate, putamen and hippocampus. The 
highest level of uptake is in regions mainly composed of white matter (pons and centrum semiovale). In

18F in vivo uptake (radioactivity accumulation) was found in some extracerebral structures in the head 
(scalp, salivary glands, muscles and cranial bone) in some cases of the electronic training programme 
(case 103, 108, 112, 113 and others). The reason for that extracerebral uptake (if due to accumulation of 
florbetapir (18F) or to any of its radioactive metabolites or to blood radioactivity) is unknown but the 
company has hypothetised that residual 18F blood activity at the time of the scan may contribute to the 
signal. Uptake in these structures might be located in the same transverse slice in which cortical uptake 
should be interpreted in florbetapir (18F) PET images, and then might interfere with image interpretation. 
Examination of sagittal images and co-registered CT or MR images could help to distinguish occipital bone 
from occipital grey matter. A wording was proposed to adress this proceeding in case of extracerebral 
uptake in the SmPC.
As cerebral amyloid angiopathy primarily shows up in the occipital lobe, which is one of the lowest 
neocortical sites of Aβ radiotracer retention in subjects with AD pathology, interference with cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy is not suspected.
Given that the maximum concentration of cold florbetapir (19F) in the average human brain is about 100 
fold less than the target concentration of labeled florbetapir (18F), there is a very low potential for 
substantial competitive binding between 19F and 18F forms of florbetapir to be expected in patients with 
AD pathology.
There is no evidence for any influence of clinical symptoms on the target’s binding properties.
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
The Applicant has provided little data on PD in this submission, however, the CHMP considered that the 
data provided are sufficient for a radiopharmaceutical which has (as opposed to conventional medicinal 
products) no pharmacological activity due to the nanodoses applied.
A dose finding study and an image time-finding study were performed before phase III trials 
(see section “Dose-response study(ies)”).
Blood clearance, brain uptake and specific distribution in the brain and the whole body as well as 
elimination of florbetapir (18F) have been investigated in healthy volunteers in the pharmacokinetic 
studies. Radiation dosimetry is similar to other (18F) containing approved PET drugs. The omission of 
pharmacokinetic studies in special populations with hepatic or renal impairment is fully justified.
It was confirmed in vitro that florbetapir (18F) binds to β-amyloid aggregates in human brain tissue. The 
correlation of in vivo florbetapir (18F) uptake and cortical ß-amyloid deposition at pathology in the pivotal 
studies refers to β-amyloid plaque combining both neuritic and diffuse plaques. The binding of florbetapir 
(18F) to other β-amyloid structures (such as cored, vascular or soluble) or to other brain structures 
(neurofibrillary tangles, other amyloid structures, etc.) has not been assessed in vivo.  Moreover, some 
extracerebral structures in the head (scalp, salivary glands, muscles and cranial bone) showed high 
uptake (radioactivity accumulation) in vivo in some cases of the training programme unknowing if due to 
accumulation of florbetapir (18F) or to any of its radioactive metabolites or to blood radioactivity. The 
observed residual activity found in white matter is thought to be linked to the regional cerebral blood flow 
in white matter.
The optimal time window for image acquisition was determined and even the test-retest reproducibility 
documented.
No in vivo pharmacodynamics drug-drug interaction studies have been performed.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
Although clinical pharmacology in radiopharmaceuticals is different to clinical pharmacology in chemicals, 
the florbetapir (18F) development programme included relevant studies on the main clinical 
pharmacological aspects for a MAA.  The company has elucidated that in vivo florbetapir (18F) correlates 
with β-amyloid plaque deposition (combining both neuritic and diffuse plaques) at autopsy. The uptake of 
florbetapir (18F) in other ß-amyloid structures or brain structures has not been assessed. Some 
extracerebral structures in some cases showed uptake, and the reason is unknown.
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study
Dose response study A03
This study compared two different doses (111 MBq [3mCi] and 370 MBq [10 mCi]) of florbetapir (18F) 
to determine the appropriate dose range for future studies. Nine subjects (5 with clinical diagnosis of 
mild/moderate AD, 4 YHC) were enrolled in the 111 MBq (3 mCi) dose group and 11 subjects (4 with 
clinical diagnosis of mild/moderate AD, 7 YHC) in the 370 MBq (10 mCi) dose group.
Images were evaluated quantitatively by SUV and SUVR of cortex areas versus either cerebellum or 
semiovale centrum, and qualitatively by visual evaluation.
Concerning the quantitative evaluation of SUVR of cortex areas versus cerebellum, results for the 111 
MBq and 370 MBq dose groups were about the same in the HC group, whereas there were slight 
quantitative differences in clinical AD subjects in favour of the 111 MBq group. 
Visual assessments of the PET imaging quality for the 370 MBq dose were overall slightly better than the 
111 MBq dose group. As the visual binary read of the PET images is the intended clinical practice it was 
concluded that the use of the 370 MBq activity is justified.
Both tested activities (111 and 370 MBq) allowed subjective visual differentiation of amyloid burden (Aβ+ 
or Aβ-) with acceptable image quality between 9 subjects with clinical diagnosis of mild/moderate AD and 
11 cognitively healthy subjects aged less than 55 years.
For dose finding the image fractionation approach was applied. The rationale for chosing the higher 370 
MBq dose, particularly to minimise movement artefacts through usage of shorter image acquisition time 
is considered to be acceptable particularly as the radiation exposure to the patient is comparable to the 
one of the widely used PET radiopharmacetical (18F) fludeoxyglucose.
2.5.2.  Main studies
The pivotal efficacy studies, Study A07 and its extension Study A16, enrolled 152 subjects with a life 
expectancy of six months or less.  Enrolled subjects were followed and those who came to autopsy within 
1 year following the PET imaging procedure were included in study A07.  Study A16 was an extension to 
enlarge the population at study A07 with patients autopsied within 12 months after the closure of study 
A07. These studies are described together below.
Methods
Pivotal study A07
This study tested the relationship between uptake in florbetapir (18F) PET imaging and true levels of β-
amyloid determined by histopathological analysis at autopsy.

Pivotal Study A16 (Extension of Study A07)
The A16 trial was an expansion of the A07 study to include all additional subjects who consented to 
autopsy and died within 12 months after the closure of study A07.
Study Participants
Two groups were enrolled in study A07: an autopsy cohort of end-of life subjects, and a specificity cohort 
of young (<40 years) subjects, cognitively and neurologically healthy. Study A16 participants were all 
end-of–life ones autopsied in study A07 enlarged with those patients autopsied within 12 months after 
the closure of study A07.
To study the relationship between PET image and histopathology results in a reasonable timeframe, an 
end-of-life population was chosen to verify the correlation between PET and histopathology as 
histopathology was more likely to be obtained in these persons.
Treatments
In study A07, all participants received 370 MBq (10 mCi) Florbetapir (18F) as one time intravenous (IV) 
bolus.
No radiopharmaceutical was administered in the A16 study.
Objectives
Study A07 was designed to: (1) the test the correlation between measurements of brain uptake in 
florbetapir (18F) PET imaging and the levels of β-amyloid measured post-mortem (Autopsy Cohort) by 
histopathology, and (2) confirm the specificity of florbetapir (18F) PET in a cohort of young, cognitively-
normal individuals with a very low likelihood of brain amyloid plaque (Specificity Cohort).
In study A16, by expanding the number of subjects available for image to histopathology comparisons 
(from the A07 trial) the following specific aims were explored:
• Determine the diagnostic performance measured as sensitivity and specificity of an independent blinded 
visual read assessment of the florbetapir-PET scan versus the final blinded neuropathological modified
CERAD diagnosis made at autopsy as reference standard;
• Reassess (using a larger number of subjects) the correlation between the semiquantitative visual rating 
(0 to 4 scale) on an independent blinded read of the florbetapir-PET scan with true levels of cortical
amyloid burden at autopsy as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Outcomes/endpoints
Subjects that came to autopsy within 1 year following the PET imaging procedure (n=35) in study A07, 
enlarged with those patients autopsied within 12 months after the closure of study A07 (n=24) in study 
A16 were evaluable for efficacy.
Endpoints tested in the efficacy population included:

In study A07, 1) correlation between imaging and amyloid levels (measured by comparing the 
uptake of the florbetapir-PET image with the underlying amyloid levels determined by post-mortem 
histopathology) in the autopsy cohort, and 2) specificity of florbetapir-PET in a cohort of young, 
cognitively-normal individuals with a very low likelihood of brain amyloid plaque (Specificity Cohort).

In study A16:
•1) Determine the diagnostic performance measured as sensitivity and specificity of an independent 
blinded visual read assessment of the florbetapir-PET scan (majority rating among 5 blinded readers used 
the binary read methodology: positive or negative) versus the final blinded neuropathological diagnosis 
made at autopsy as reference standard (modified CERAD neuropathological diagnosis of probable/definite 
AD = positive, no/possible AD = negative) which is based on the density of neuritic plaques on sections 
of frontal, temporal or parietal cortex with maximum involvement in autopsy specimens (see table below). 
For the florbetapir studies, a modified CERAD neuropathological diagnosis of No, Possible, Probable and 
Definite AD, was assigned to each autopsy case.

None (<1)
Sparse (1-5)
Moderate (6-19)

The number of readers in Study A16 was defined beforehand by using statistical modeling to assess the 
impact of the number of readers on the Fleiss kappa statistic: 5 readers was optimal because the range 
of the 95% confidence interval on Fleiss kappa improved the most with 5 readers. All physicians 
interpreting images for the diagnostic performance endpoints of sensitivity and specificity were blinded to 
the neuropathological results and other clinical information.
• 2) Reassess (using a larger number of subjects) the correlation between the semiquantitative visual 
rating (0 to 4 scale) on an independent blinded read of the florbetapir-PET scan with true levels of cortical 
amyloid burden at autopsy as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) expressed as average area % of 
the slides examined for a given region of the brain (which includes both neuritic and diffuse plaques).
The cognitive status of the recruited patients was difficult to determine, as their clinical diagnosis of 
dementia subtype is likely inaccurate as settled only on the basis of previous clinical history and a brief 
cognitive battery at the screening visit without mandatorily performing either MRI or other laboratory 
tests to exclude the presence of either significant white matter disease or other non-neurodegenerative 
dementias.
In the studies, standardisation took place in several aspects of the florbetapir (18F) PET scan: dosing, 
subject preparation, positioning and duration of imaging.
A binary visual reading methodology of florbetapir (18F) PET scan as positive or negative was used in 
clinical study A16 and is identical to the read method proposed for clinical use in the SmPC.
A semi-quantitative (on a 5-point scale from 0 =no amyloid to 4 =high levels of amyloid) and 
quantitative PET reading methodology were also implemented in the pivotal studies. The company 
selected six particular cortical regions (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, precuneus, parietal cortex, 
anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate) for the quantitative and semi quantitative PET reading 
methods as being showed, early in the development programme, that had consistently shown to have 
high florbetapir (18F) uptake in patients with clinically probable AD and tracked well with the visual 
impression.  The qualitative PET reading method, however, does not limit image assessment to specific 
cortical regions but to the whole cortex.
Histopathology was performed on autopsy samples by the immunohistochemistry and the Bielchowsky 
staining method. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), which measures both neuritic and diffuse plaques 
combined, was used as a histopathology standard of truth for the correlation endpoint. Standardised 
brain sectioning and tissue embedding were performed for each brain. The chosen brain regions and 
slides to read were according to published standard techniques.  The six brain regions analysed were the

same already selected in the quantitative PET reading methodology, and included those 3 regions whose 
assessment is required for the confirmatory diagnosis of AD according to the CERAD criteria.  Each region 
might have a probability of significant β–amyloid deposition.   The modified CERAD neuropathology 
diagnosis method was the reference standard for the diagnostic performance endpoints (sensitivity and 
specificity). This method used a cut-off between none-sparse (negative) and moderate-frequent 
(positive) neuritic plaque density measured by Bielchowsky staining method on sections of frontal, 
temporal or parietal cortex with maximum involvement in autopsy specimens.
To study the relationship between image and histopathology results, FDA requested an autopsy 
population to verify the correlation between PET and histopathology: the end-of-life population was the 
one in whom histopathology was more likely to be obtained in a reasonable timeframe.
Sample size
Out of 152 subjects end of life population who consented to autopsy, all subjects who were autopsied 
within 12 months or their PET imaging procedure (study A07), enlarged with those patients autopsied 
within 12 months after the closure of study A07 (study A16).
Randomisation
Three independent imaging physicians evaluated the florbetapir-PET scans from the autopsy cohort in 
randomized blinded fashion in study A07 (five different readers in A16). The presumed negative 
florbetapir-PET images from the specificity cohort were mixed in random order with 40 images from the 
autopsy cohort. 
Blinding (masking)
In study A07, separate groups of three readers were used for the autopsy and specificity cohort read. 
All PET scan readers were blinded to any clinical or histopathology data on the subject scans being 
evaluated. Images were read by three different readers than those used for the correlation analysis 
conducted on the autopsy cohort.
In study A16, there were five blinded and independent image readers for primary analyses (sensitivity 
and specificity calculations). Additionally, a semi-quantitative visual evaluation was done by by three 
blinded and independent image readers.
The possible impact of unblinded results of Study A07 on the protocol and analysis plan of study A16 was 
discussed. A considerable bias would have been expected for the binary read against dichotomized 
neuropathology results introduced in the Study A16 if results of Study A07 were known. However, it was 
shown that the protocol for Study A16 and Statistical Analysis Plan for Study A07 were finalized before 
data and results of Study A07 were available.
Readers in Study A16 were different from those in study A07. Results for sensitivity and specificity are 
only available for the 5 readers in Study A16.
Statistical methods
All correlation analyses were one-sided while all other statistical tests were two-sided with a significance 
level of α=0.05 and were performed using statistical analysis system (SAS) version 9.0 or higher. Data 
were summarized using descriptive statistics.
For the primary efficacy correlation analysis and the secondary efficacy analysis, Spearman’s rank order 
correlation was determined as well as the asymptotic standard error (ASE) and 95% CI using Fisher z-

transformation. For the primary efficacy specificity analysis, the number and percent of Aβ- and the 95% 
CI was determined using the florbetapir F 18 PET scan. Exploratory efficacy analyses were also 
conducted.
All adverse event summaries were prepared using the set of treatment-emergent adverse events only. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events were summarized by cohort (autopsy, non-autopsy specificity) as 
well as all subjects (both cohorts). The change from baseline in clinical laboratory values and vital sign 
measurements were analyzed within treatment group.
Results
Participant flow
Autopsy Cohort
A total of 226 subjects were enrolled in the study. For the autopsy cohort, 152 subjects were enrolled 
from various end-of-life (e.g., hospice/hospital/nursing home) and late-life (longitudinal studies of aging) 
populations to yield 35 autopsies within 1 year following the PET imaging procedure. The first 6 subjects 
to come to autopsy were considered front runners, and an interim analysis was completed on data from 
these subjects in order to refine the study methods (PET and autopsy). No significant changes in the 
clinical study protocol, the PET image Independent Review Charter, or the Neuropathology Analysis 
Protocol were made following the front runner review. The front-runner analysis confirmed that an 
autopsy study population of 29 was sufficient to test the primary correlation hypothesis in the main phase 
of the trial.

for specificity analysis of florbetapir (18F) PET. ApoE ε4 carriers or persons with unknown ApoE ε4 status

subject completed). Study A16 ended 18th March 2011 (last subject completed).Out of 226 subjects 
recruited in the autopsy cohort, 59 autopsies were obtained in the 2 years.
Conduct of the study
Study A07 was conducted at 34 study centres in the United States.  Study A16 was conducted at 22 
study centres in the United States.
The main protocol amendment was the use of first 6 patients with autopsy results as test cases to refine 
methods. These results were not included in the primary analysis, but sensitivity analyses including these 
patients are in line with the primary results.

Baseline data
Of the 59 subjects composing the primary analysis population, 29 subjects had a clinical diagnosis of AD, 
13 had another type of clinically-diagnosed dementing disorder, 12 had no history of cognitive 
impairment or dementia, and 5 had a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It has to be 
noted that the clinical diagnosis of dementia subtype is likely to be inaccurate, as attributed only on the 
basis of previous clinical history and a brief cognitive battery at the screening visit without mandatorily 
performing either MRI or other laboratory tests to exclude the presence of either significant white matter 
disease or other non-neurodegenerative dementias.
Numbers analysed
Fifty-nine subjects who came to autopsy within 12 months of their florbetapir-PET scan (study A07) plus 
those patients autopsied within 12 months after the closure of study A07 (study A16) comprised the 
primary analysis population. Of these, 46 had valid images and came to autopsy within 12 months of the 
florbetapir-PET scan and comprised the secondary analysis population. The other 13 subjects had an 
average interval of 16 months between image and autopsy.
Outcomes and estimation
Study A07
• Primary Endpoint -Correlation Analysis (Autopsy Cohort) 
A statistically significant Spearman’s ρ of 0.78 (p<0.0001, 95% CI: 0.58 - 0.89) was observed between 
the median of the independent reader semi-quantitative visual ratings of the florbetapir-PET image and 
the true cortical amyloid level as assessed by quantitative IHC (average percent cortical grey matter area

of β-amyloid on the IHC slides, staining both neuritic and diffuse plaques) in 29 patients of the autopsy 
cohort. Thus, the study met its primary hypothesis #1 as a significant correlation (ρ>0) was obtained.
• Primary Endpoint - Specificity Analysis (Specificity cohort)
In the specificity cohort, 100% (47/47) of young healthy control subjects were rated as negative on the 
visual binary reading of florbetapir-PET scan. The 95% CI for the primary specificity analysis blinded read 
was 91% to 100%. Thus, the study met its primary hypothesis as ≥90% of the florbetapir-PET scans 
from subjects in the specificity cohort were rated as negative on an independent visual PET reading, 
using the majority view of three readers.
• Secondary Endpoint - Regional Correlation Analysis of Semi-quantitative Visual Blinded PET Read with 
Measurement of Cortical Amyloid Burden (IHC)
Statistically significant relationships were observed between the 6 regional semi-quantitative visual 
ratings of the florbetapir-PET image (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, precuneus, parietal cortex, anterior 
cingulate, and posterior cingulate) and the regional cortical amyloid levels as assessed by quantitative 
IHC. The correlation coefficients between the six analysis regions and regional measures of IHC ranged 
from 0.68 - 0.77 (p<0.0001, 95% CI: 0.42 - 0.88).
Study A16
Primary Endpoint: Diagnostic Performance--Sensitivity and Specificity of florbetapir (18F) PET Scan Visual 
Qualitative Read Compared to the Neuropathologist’s modified CERAD Diagnosis
The primary analysis was performed on the 59 subjects who came to autopsy within 12 months of the 
original florbetapir-PET scan or those autopsied within 12 months after closuring study A07 (efficacy 
population). The diagnostic agreement of the visual binary qualitative rating of the florbetapir-PET scan 
imaging (positive, negative) with the neuropathologist’s modified CERAD diagnosis was determined. Of 
the 59 subjects of the efficacy population 30 (51%) subjects had a neuropathologic diagnosis of definite 
AD, 9 (15%) had a classification of probable AD, 5 (8%) had a classification of possible AD, and 15 
(25%) had a classification of no AD. In this analysis, the visual qualitative PET rating of amyloid burden 
was the majority rating among five blinded readers’ assessments. The sensitivity and specificity and 
accuracy for detection of the neuropathologist’s modified CERAD diagnosis of probable/definite AD 
pathology were:
Sensitivity = 92% (95% CI: 78% to 98%)
Specificity = 100% (95% CI: 80% to 100%)
Accuracy = 95% (95% CI: 85% to 99%).
The NPV and PPV in the autopsy population sample were 87% (65-97%) and 100% (88-100%), 
respectively.
Some patients had PET-only images and others had both PET and CT images to be fused.  It would 
appear that the fusion of PET and CT scan helps avoid interpretation errors due to technical problems in 
the scan itself or in brain anatomy (levels of atrophy). Therefore, the SmPC encourages the use of CT 
scans whenever there is uncertainty about the location of grey matter and grey/white matter border in 
the PET scan.
Primary Endpoint: Correlation Between Florbetapir-PET Visual Semiquantitative Rating and Cortical 
Amyloid Levels (IHC)
A correlation analysis between the florbetapir-PET visual semi-quantitative rating on a 5-point scale (from 
0 =no amyloid to 4 =high levels of amyloid) and the cortical amyloid as determined by IHC revealed a 
Amyvid
Assessment report

Page 34/78
significant Spearman’s ρ of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.85, p<0.0001).  On the other hand, the true β–
amyloid burden by IHC was very variable and overlapped for most semiquantitative PET rates.
The binary method rating method of florbetapir-PET imaging is considered to be robust in different clinical 
settings but the CHMP proposed to develop the quantitative method further.
Ancillary analyses
Clinical Diagnosis Comparison (study A07)
On an exploratory basis, the clinical diagnosis was compared to final autopsy diagnosis (the so-called 
“binary neuropathological diagnosis”). Of the 23 subjects in the autopsy cohort who had a clinical 
dementia diagnoses (AD or other dementias), 3 (13%) had a clinical diagnosis that did not match the 
final autopsy diagnosis: a single subject had a clinical diagnosis of probable AD in life, but was negative 
for AD at autopsy; and 2 subjects had a clinical diagnosis of other dementing disorders (one each with 
Parkinson’s disease dementia and Lewy body dementia), but both received a final autopsy diagnosis 
consistent with AD. The florbetapir-PET scan blinded read result agreed with the autopsy diagnosis in all 
three of these cases.
Diagnostic Test Performance--Sensitivity and Specificity of Florbetapir-PET Quantitative Analysis (SUVR) 
versus the Neuropathologist’s modified CERAD Diagnosis (study A16)
An exploratory analysis was performed on the 59 subjects who came to autopsy within 12 months of 
their florbetapir-PET scan or within 12 months after closuring study A07. The diagnostic agreement 
between the automated SUVR quantitation of the florbetapir-PET scan (Aβ+, Aβ-) using a pre-defined 
cut-off and the neuropathologist’s modified CERAD diagnosis was determined.
The sensitivity and specificity for the neuropathologist’s modified CERAD diagnosis of probable/definite 
AD pathology was 97% and 100% respectively. The accuracy was 98%, and the NPV and PPV were 95% 
and 100%, respectively. Overall, the SUVR measure was discordant with autopsy for a single subject 
(137-002).
Secondary analysis in study A16 (subgroup of subjects with autopsies within 12 months)
Inter-Reader Reliability
A total of 295 image evaluations of florbetapir-PET scans were performed and compared with autopsy 
results. 
The pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI: 82% to 91%), pooled specificity was 95% (95% CI: 88% to 
98%), and the accuracy was 90% (95% CI: 86% to 93%). The Fleiss’ kappa statistic was 0.75 for the 
inter-reader agreement analysis using qualitative (binary) reads. In only 6% of all image reads was an 
individual reader’s result different from the majority reader outcome.  The inter-reader agreement 
(kappa) was ≥0.82 (p<0.0001) for all reader comparisons except those for reader 5.  Such reader 
presented sensitivity and negative predictive values as low as 69% while for the other four readers were 
closed to the majority analysis (87-95%). There is not really an explanation for the different behaviour of 
reader 5 in comparison to the other readers. It was however hypothesised that due to the fact that 
advanced AD subjects being prone to movement, or with atrophy and a thinned cortical ribbon, the 
images from these subjects are more difficult to interpret. A wording was proposed for inclusion in the 
SmPC, section 4.4:
Some scans may be difficult to interpret due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon, or 
image blur, which could lead to interpretation errors. For cases in which there is uncertainty about the 
location of grey matter and of the grey/white matter border on the PET scan, and a co-registered recent 
CT or MR image is available, the interpreter should examine the fused PET-CT or PET-MR image to clarify 
the relationship of the PET radioactivity and the grey matter anatomy.

Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 35/78
The interreader agreement for the correlation analysis between semiquantitative PET rating and 
histopathology was only moderate (kappa=0.47) between reader 1 and 2 while mildly substantial (kappa 
values of 0.64 and 0.62) for the other paired readers.
Clinical Pathologic Comparison
On an exploratory basis, clinical diagnosis was compared to final autopsy diagnosis (the so-called “binary 
neuropathological diagnosis”). Of the 42 subjects in the autopsy cohort who had clinical dementia 
diagnoses (AD or other dementias), one subject had a clinical diagnosis of probable AD in life, but was 
negative for AD at autopsy; and 8 subjects did not have a clinical diagnosis of AD in life, but did have a 
neuropathologic diagnosis of AD at autopsy. In addition, one of the 12 subjects in the autopsy cohort with 
a clinical diagnosis of normal cognition at enrolment had an autopsy diagnosis of definite AD. The 
florbetapir-PET scan blinded read result agreed with the autopsy diagnosis in all of the cases where there 
was discordance between clinical and autopsy diagnosis.
Range and Distribution of β-amyloid Pathology for Study Subjects
The β-amyloid histology observed in this autopsy study population ranged from none to frequent neuritic 
plaques and from 0% to 14% β-amyloid by IHC staining. The distribution of the modified CERAD 
diagnosis revealed that 30 (51%) subjects had a neuropathologic diagnosis of definite AD, 9 (15%) 
subjects had probable AD, 5 (8%) had possible AD, and 15 (25%) were classified as no AD. 
When PET images were quantitatively read, correlation of PET uptake (averaging 6 prespecified cortical 
regions) versus the measurement of β-amyloid deposition by IHC was ρ=0.75 (p<0.0001).
Among the nine cases that had sparse/no plaques at autopsy, all were correctly rated as “negative” using 
the binary PET read method.  Among the four cases that had moderate/frequent plaques at autopsy, two 
were correctly read as “positive” and two were read as “negative” (i.e. false negative scan results, which 
in one case is explained by a possible change between image acquisition and autopsy) at PET images.

Design
Study A07 was designed to: (1) the test the correlation between uptake at 
florbetapir-PET imaging and the levels of β-amyloid measured post-mortem 
(Autopsy Cohort) by histopathology, and (2) confirm the specificity of 
florbetapir-PET in a cohort of young, cognitively-normal individuals with a very low 
likelihood of brain amyloid plaque (Specificity Cohort).
Study A16 was designed to test the relationship between uptake at florbetapir 
(18F) PET imaging and true levels of amyloid burden determined at autopsy, and to 
evaluate the diagnostic performance of florbetapir (sensitivity and specificity) for 
detecting the modified CERAD neuropathological diagnosis of probable/definitive 
AD based on histopathology

Hypotheses
Study A07 Primary hypothesis #1: Correlation analysis
There is a statistically significant correlation (ρ>0) between the semi-quantitative 
visual rating of the florbetapir-PET scan and the cortical amyloid burden 
(combining both neuritic and diffuse plaques) at autopsy as assessed by 
quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC). Spearman’s Rank Order Correlation,
one-sided, p < 0.05, ρ>0, is used to assess a significant correlation
Study A07 Primary hypothesis #2: Specificity analysis
The observed specificity of florbetapir-PET imaging is ≥90% in young healthy 
controls (i.e., ≥90% of the florbetapir-PET scans from subjects in the specificity 
cohort would be rated as negative, which yields 95% CI bounds of 80% to 98% 
for n=40).
Study A16 Primary hypothesis A: Observed sensitivity of florbetapir-PET scan is ≥ 
80%. 
Study A16 Primary hypothesis B: Observed specificity of florbetapir-PET scan is ≥ 
80%.

Descriptive 
Study A07 Statistics All correlation analyses were one-sided while all other statistical 
statistics 
tests were two-sided with a significance level of α=0.05 and were performed using 
statistical analysis system (SAS) version 9.0 or higher. Data were summarized using 
descriptive statistics.
For the primary efficacy correlation analysis and the secondary efficacy analysis, 
Spearman’s rank order correlation was determined as well as the asymptotic standard 
error (ASE) and 95% CI using Fisher z-transformation. For the primary efficacy 
specificity analysis, the number and percent of Aβ- and the 95% CI was determined 
using the florbetapir (18F) PET scan.
Study A16 Statistics All correlation analyses were tested with a one-sided significance 
level of α=0.05. The diagnostic statistical measurements (e.g., sensitivity, specificity) 
were provided with two-sided 95% CIs. Analyses were performed using Statistical 
Analysis System (SAS) version 9.0 or higher. Data were summarized using descriptive 
statistics. Statistical analyses evaluated the performance of the qualitative PET image 
read (using neuropathology as the reference standard). Additional analyses evaluated 
the Spearman’s rank correlation between global and regional PET image scores and 
neuropathology measurements.
Study A07 Participant flow A total of 226 subjects were enrolled in the study, 152 in 
the autopsy cohort and 74 (all cognitively normal) in the specificity cohort. At the end 
of the study, 110 subjects in the autopsy cohort were alive and had valid images, and 
37 subjects had died. Of the 37 subjects who had died, consent to perform the autopsy 
for 2 subjects was withdrawn by their families. Thus, there were 35 subjects in the 
autopsy cohort who completed the trial and had data available for the correlation 
efficacy analyses. The first six subjects to come to autopsy were used in the front-
runner analysis, and the remaining 29 subjects comprised the primary efficacy 
population for the autopsy cohort. Of the 74 subjects in the specificity cohort, 47 were 
identified as non-ApoE ε4 carriers and were included in the primary specificity efficacy 
analyses. All 226 subjects injected with florbetapir (18F) were included in the safety 
analyses.
At the close of the A07 study, 35 subjects were part of the autopsy efficacy population 
and 108 subjects with valid imaging data were alive and enrolled in the A16 extension 
study. At the end of the A16 study, 79 subjects were alive and an additional 29 
subjects had died. Five subjects withdrew consent for autopsy resulting in 24 subjects 
added to the efficacy population. 
Thus, a total of 59 subjects had completed brain autopsy neuropathology procedures. 
All 59 had valid images and had come to autopsy within 24 months of their florbetapir-
PET scan. 
Twenty-nine subjects had a clinical diagnosis of AD, 13 had another type of clinically-
diagnosed dementing disorder, 12 had no history of cognitive impairment or dementia, 
and 5 had a clinical diagnosis of MCI. These 59 subjects comprised the primary 
analysis population.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis)
An analysis of subpopulation factors known to influence β-amyloid deposition (clinical presentation, age 
and ApoE status) was performed by pooling data across the following studies: A01, A03, A04, A05 and 
A07. Furthermore an analysis according to gender, race and concomitant use of Alzheimer’s disease 
medication was undertaken. In order to do a common analysis on the maximum number of subjects, the 
quantitative SUVR evaluation of florbetapir-PET scans was chosen as the primary imaging parameter for 
the integrated analysis. A quantitative cut-point was applied so that SUVR values > 1.10 were considered 
amyloid positive and values less than 1.10 were considered amyloid negative.
No meta-analysis was done.
Relationship between clinical presentation and PET Amyloid Levels (SUVR)
Mean florbetapir-PET signal was highest in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD, lowest in HC. 
MCI subjects showed concentrations of both high and low SUVR values consistent with the expected 
heterogeneity of this group. Approximately 85% of clinical AD subjects, 40 % of MCI subjects, and 15% 
of cognitively normal subjects were rated positive using any florbetapir-PET measure, which is similar 
with findings from autopsy literature
The applicant states that the cognitive scales collected from subjects of the Autopsy Cohort of Study A07 
were excluded since they were not considered to be reliable in this terminally ill population.
Age
The integrated analysis demonstrated a positive association between age and uptake on florbetapir-PET, 
particularly in the clinically normal HC group and the MCI group. 
ApoE Status
Genotyping data were collected in Studies A04, A05, and A07. In the integrated analysis of these data, 
ApoE ε4 was highly associated with increased β-amyloid florbetapir-PET scans across multiple 
presentation groups. The pooled analysis indicates that the florbetapir-PET signal is consistent with the 
increased risk of amyloid pathology of ApoE ε4 and seems to be also sensitive to detect the reduced risk 
associated with ApoE ε2 allele. In the clinical setting sporadic Alzheimer cases without obvious 
association to genetics are of interest.
Gender and Race
There is no evidence for differences in efficacy based on gender and race.
Concomitant use of Alzheimer’s disease medication
The integrated database was used to investigate whether there is an interaction of florbetapir (18F) with 
AD medications. The use of AD medication remained in the model as a possible explanatory factor (0.05 
<p<0.15) for only memantine, but was not statistically significant. However, memantine is considered to 
be a symptomatic treatment and not a disease modifying treatment. Therefore interaction is unlikely.
Clinical studies in special populations
There were no studies in renal or hepatic impaired patients. With respect to subpopulation factors see 
analysis performed across trials below. The use of florbetapir (18F) in children cannot be recommended, 
and it is not expected.

Supportive study(ies)
Data to the clinical efficacy of florbetapir-PET was provided from a Phase 2 study (A05) and its clinical 
follow-up extension study (A11), primarily aimed to differentiate clinical probable AD from normal 
cognition by both a quantitative and a binary visual interpretation of florbetapir (18F) PET images, and 
secondarily to differentiate them from MCI. 151 subjects who received florbetapir-PET scans in Study 
A05 agreed to participate in Study A11, a 36-month longitudinal study to evaluate cognitive outcomes. 
Interim results from the 18-month follow-up visit of Study A11 and only very limited results from the 36-
month follow-up were provided.
The potential of florbetapir-PET to impact diagnostic thinking was investigated in Study A13 by 
simulating a diagnostic situation.  In this study, experts in the clinical diagnosis and management of AD 
reviewed case histories prepared for 44 subjects enrolled in Study A05 while blinded to the subject’s 
florbetapir-PET results.  The experts were asked to assign a diagnosis, a confidence value associated with 
the diagnosis, and a proposed clinical management plan.  The subject’s florbetapir-PET results were then 
revealed, and the experts were again asked to provide the diagnosis, confidence value, and a new clinical 
management plan, if applicable.
Supportive studies were also those assessing the training methods in the sense of diagnostic performance 
and inter/intra-reader reproducibility (Study A08, A09 and PT01) and the test-retest reproducibility 
(Study A04).
Study A05
This study was an open label, parallel group, multicenter study, evaluating the safety and imaging 
characteristics of 18F-AV-45 in healthy volunteers, patients with MCI and patients with clinical diagnosis 
of probable Alzheimer’s disease. The study was primarily aimed to differentiate clinical AD from normal 
cognition by both a quantitative and a binary visual interpretation of florbetapir (18F) PET images, and 
secondarily to differentiate them from MCI.
A total of 184 subjects (45 subjects with clinical diagnosis of probable AD and mild/moderate dementia, 
60 subjects with MCI as cognitive impairment of non-obvious cases lasting less than 12 months, and 79 
cognitively normal subjects) were enrolled in the study.
Results

Florbetapir 18F PET image assessments: The semi-quantitative median PET rating (0-4) was 
highly correlated with the quantitative mean cortical SUVR (r=0.808, P<0.0001), and there was excellent 
agreement between the qualitative binary (Aβ+ and Aβ-) and semi-quantitative visual reads (100% 
agreement) and between mean cortical SUVR and qualitative visual reads (91% agreement).

Concerning the technical performance for binary reads (positive or negative) there were 
differences observed between the different readers. A very good agreement was observed for 2 of the 
three readers (Kappa= 0.86), while Reader 2 had unacceptable agreement with the two other readers 
(Kappa=0.46 and Kappa=0.48, respectively). These results are in line with observations of in the A16 
study, indicating that results for individual readers could vary substantially, and further supporting the 
importance of adequate training.

Clinical diagnostic group: The 18F-AV-45 PET cortical brain signal was highest in subjects with a 
clinical diagnosis of AD, lowest in cognitively normal subjects, and intermediate in subjects with MCI. 
Results show 75.6% of subjects with AD, 38.3% of subjects with MCI, and 14.1% of cognitively normal 
subjects were rated as positive in PET images. Subjects with clinically diagnosed probable AD were rated 
as negative by qualitative rating of the 18F-AV-45 PET scan in 24.4% of cases.

EMA/30808/2013
Page 41/78

Age: In cognitively normal subjects, rates of PET positivity increased with age: 5.3%, 10.5%, 
15.0%, and 25.0% of cognitively normal subjects aged 50 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 years or 
more, respectively, were rated as PET positive.

ApoE genotype: Subjects in the ApoE2 group had statistically significantly lower mean cortical 
SUVRs than subjects in the ApoE4 group, regardless of diagnostic category, and no subjects in the ApoE2 
group were rated as PET positive, regardless of diagnostic category.

Cognitive testing: For subjects with clinical AD, there were statistically significant negative 
correlations between median PET uptake and scores on the Digit-Symbol Substitution (P=0.0162) and on 
the GDS (P=0.0310). Subjects with clinically diagnosed AD and low PET uptake, tended to score higher 
on the depression scale. The applicant concludes that these data suggest clinical depression as an 
alternative cause for clinical dementia in these subjects. This is not totally endorsed since patients with 
AD also have depressive symptoms. For subjects with MCI, there was a statistically significant negative 
correlation between median PET uptake and scores on the Digit-Symbol Substitution (P=0.0239), with 
high PET uptake correlating with poorer performance. Overall there is only a weak correlation between 
generally used cognitive tests such as ADAS-cog and  ADCS-ADL and PET uptake in the MCI and AD 
group.
The CHMP considered that enrolled subjects may not encompass the anticipated population in which 
florbetapir (18F) will be used. Not all tests standardized for management of patients suspected of AD 
(e.g. concurrent MRI, blood tests, …) were utilised to confirm the absence of systemic disorders or other 
brain diseases that could account for the progressive cognitive impairment.
Overall there was only a weak correlation between generally used cognitive tests such as ADAS-cog and  
ADCS-ADL and PET uptake in the MCI and AD group.
Study A05 is therefore not considered a study of confirmatory nature but supportive.
Statistical methods for exploratory analyses performed were considered appropriate.
Study A11- Diagnostic utility
This was an extension of study A05, a longitudinal study of long-term (36 month) cognitive outcomes in 
healthy volunteers, patients with MCI and patients with AD who have previously had PET imaging with 
Florbetapir (18F). A total of 151 subjects (31 subjects with clinical diagnosis of probable AD and 
mild/moderate dementia, 51 subjects with MCI as cognitive impairment of non-obvious cases lasting less 
than 12 months, and 69 CN-cognitively normal- subjects) who participated in the previous phase II study 
(A05) were enrolled in this study. A total of 140 subjects completed the study as of Month 18 (27 
subjects with AD, 46 subjects with MCI, and 67 CN subjects), and 142 as of Month 36 (28 with clinical 
AD, 47 MCI and 67 CN).
The primary analysis focused on an analysis of the risk of cognitive deterioration in MCI in a 36-month 
follow-up in subjects with PET positive and negative, and also depending on a pre-defined value of SUV.
There was a planned  interim analysis at 18 of 36 months, a report of which was included in the MAA. 
The study concluded during the dossier evaluation procedure, and a limited summary of the final results 
at month 36 were provided by the applicant (the final study report was not available at the time of 
opinion).
Primary Outcomes (in MCI Subjects)
• Clinical conversion (improvement or worsening) in MCI subjects. Most of the patients had an 
unchanged MCI status after 18 or 36 months irrespective of the PET result (see table below).

of MCI progression to clinical AD.
Sensitivity of Amyvid scan to show the MCI conversion rate to AD in 9 converters was 66.7% 
• Progressive cognitive impairment in MCI subjects:

At the 18-month follow-up visit, 41.2% out of the MCI subjects at baseline who had a positive 
florbetapir-PET scan experienced a clinically significant deterioration in ADAS-Cog score of ≥4 while such 
deterioration was observed in  13.3% of MCI subjects with PET images rated as negative (p<0.0001).

For subjects with MCI at baseline, there was a significant relationship between PET scan positivity 
and decreases in cognitive performance, as measured on a number of the functional and psychometric 
assessments. Within this clinical diagnostic group, there were statistically significant relationships 
between the majority of the functional and psychometric assessments and PET uptake, as measured by 
the binary visual image assessment (positive or negative) or the quantitative image assessment (SUVR), 
with positive scans associated with worse cognitive performance. As a group, the MCI subjects with a 
positive PET scan showed a greater mean worsening of functional and psychometric test scores over time 
than MCI subjects with a negative PET scan. Of the 3 clinical diagnostic groups, differences in the 
changes from baseline functional and psychometric test scores at Month 18 between subjects with PET 
images rated as positive and those with images rated as negative were most pronounced in subjects with 
MCI.

Secondary Outcome
• Stability of clinical diagnosis of AD

One subject who had a clinical diagnosis of AD at baseline received a different clinical diagnosis at 
the 18-month follow-up visit. This subject had a PET image rated negative and was diagnosed with non-
AD dementia at the 18-month follow-up visit.
Additional Results
• Progressive cognitive impairment in CN subjects

CN subjects showed relatively minor changes in most functional and psychometric test scores 
over the 18-month interval; however, both ADAS-Cog (p=0.0112) and the CDR global score (p=0.0151) 
showed statistically significant declines in subjects whose PET images were classified as positive.

From the CN subjects at baseline with a positive florbetapir-PET scan, 40.0% experienced a 
clinically significant change (≥4 points) on the ADAS-Cog.  It happened in 5.3% of CN subjects at 
baseline with a negative florbetapir-PET scan, respectively) (p<0.0001).
Most individual functional and psychometric test scores showed only minor changes which were not 
statistically significant over the 18-month follow-up interval.
• Clinical conversion in CN subjects

20% of CN subjects with a positive baseline florbetapir-PET scan and 3.5% of CN subjects with a 
negative baseline florbetapir-PET scan converted to a clinical diagnosis of MCI or AD at the 18-month 
follow-up. This difference was not statistically significant (p=0.1029).  Percentage comparisons are based 
on very low absolute numbers. Only 2 patients in the CN group with PET scans rated as positive 
converted to MCI or clinical AD after 18 months. Of note the absolute number was identical in the CN 
group with negative PET scan.

Baseline PET results in all three groups
It should be pointed out that of the 31 patients initially diagnosed with cllinical AD 10 had a negative PET 
scan, while the remaining 21 had a positive scan. There were 19 MCI patients at baseline with a positive 
PET scan, while 32 MCI patients had a negative scan.  In cognitively normal subjects at baseline, there 
were 10 with a positive PET while 59 had a negative scan.  Agreement of PET scan results with the

Conclusions: Sensitivity for diagnosis of AD by PET was 70 % of patients using the clinical diagnosis of 
probable AD as standard, and it was only 37% for the diagnosis of MCI.
After the 36-month follow-up, 9 out of 47 (19%) MCI subjects had converted from MCI at baseline to AD, 
independently if they had a positive or a negative florbetapir (18F) PET scan.  Out of the total of 17 MCI 
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 44/78
subjects at baseline who had a positive PET scan, only 6 (35%) were classified clinically as converted to 
AD after 36 months.  10.0 % (n=3) of patients with MCI rated PET negative progressed to clinical AD.
With respect to clinical diagnosis of AD sensitivity of florbetapir PET imaging is not as in the autopsy 
population. The data indicate that Florbetapir-PET scan results are more closely related to the 
histopathological changes than to the clinical symptoms of AD and that they may somehow complement 
but not replace the complex clinical diagnosis of AD.
Although the primary aim of the study is clinically very relevant, the power of the study is considered to 
be rather low. With full enrollment and the assumptions the applicant presents (60 MCI patients with one 
half with positive PET and one half with negative PET, population MCI to AD conversion rate 15% for 18-
month period) the study would have a power of 75% for a conversion ratio of 8/1 for positive PET and 
negative PET subjects, respectively. For a conversion ratio of 7/2 for positive PET and negative PET 
subjects, respectively, the power would be only 41%. Actually the A11 protocol enrolled only 51 MCI 
patients and this further diminishes the power.
The statistical methods are considered appropriate and methods for additional analyses are acceptable.
Study A13 (Impact on Diagnostic Thinking)
The primary objective of this study was to determine the impact of qualitative visual read of florbetapir 
(18F) PET (as performed in study A05) on diagnostic thinking by 3 independent expert clinicians.
The following exploratory endpoints were determined: If a florbetapir-PET scan could:
a)
b)
c)
change expert clinicians’ initial clinical diagnoses to be consistent with the florbetapir-PET scans
change expert clinicians’ diagnostic certainty
change expert clinicians’ patient management plans
Clinical data and florbetapir imaging results from 44 subjects who participated in a previous phase II 
study (A05) were included. New subjects were not evaluated in this study. Twenty-two subjects with 
enrolling clinical diagnosis of AD and 22 subjects with enrolling clinical diagnosis of MCI were included in 
this study. Half the subjects in each group had a scan previously (in A05) read as PET negative; 
the other half had scans previously read as PET positive (based on majority read).
It is a retrospective study and there were no longitudinal observations. An expert clinician review  panel  
(ECRP) issued a pretest and posttest diagnosis among many clinical diagnostic categories (cognitively 
normal, MCI -indeterminate etiology, due to AD or unlikely due to AD- or dementia -indeterminate 
etiology, due to AD and unlikely due to AD-).
Study Results:
Primary Endpoint:
After reviewing the clinical case report (blinded to the initial clinical diagnosis made by the enrolling 
physician in A05), and prior to receiving information about the patient’s florbetapir-PET amyloid imaging 
results, the expert’s diagnosis indicated either cognitive impairment of indeterminate origin or 
suggested an origin inconsistent with PET scan results (e.g., dementia due to AD in a patient with an 
amyloid negative PET scan) in 59% of the 44 cases (range 50-66%). When presented with the 
florbetapir-PET scan results, these experts changed their diagnosis in 85% (range 66-100%) of the cases 
with indeterminate origin or inconsistent with PET scan results. This represented a significant shift in 
diagnostic thinking (p <0.001, 95% CI 80-100%).
Exploratory Endpoints:
Exploratory #1: Consistency of Diagnosis with florbetapir-PET:
Overall, the ECRP provided a diagnosis that was consistent with the florbetapir-PET-scan results 87% of 
the time. This is less than the pre-specified outcome of consistency of diagnosis with florbetapir scan of 
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 45/78
at least 90% and is explained by the fact that only two of three expert clinicians had diagnoses consistent 
with florbetapir-PET 95% and 98 % of the time.
Exploratory #2: Clinician diagnostic certainty:
For cases where the clinician’s initial and final diagnoses were the same, regardless of agreement with 
the PET scan, confidence in their final diagnoses improved after unblinding of scan results, as indicated 
by a shift from 76 to 92 on a 100 point scale, where higher numbers indicated increased confidence 
(p <0.0001).
Exploratory #3: Clinician management plan:
For the entire group of 44 cases, the three expert clinicians altered specific components of their 
management plan in 80% of the cases they reviewed (range 75-84%, p < 0.0001) as a consequence of 
the information provided by the florbetapir-PET scan.
Conclusions: This study attempted to demonstrate that information from a florbetapir-PET scan could 
have a significant effect on a physician’s clinical diagnosis, diagnostic confidence, and patient 
management.  However, it could not be concluded whether this observed change in diagnostic thinking 
leads to a clinically relevant change in patient management.
Study A06 (Time window imaging Study)
This study is a comparison of PET images acquired at 30 min and 50 min post injection of 18F-AV-45 in 
Healthy Volunteers and AD Patients. It serves as the primary source for characterisation of the time 
course of florbetapir (18F) PET imaging in this MAA.  It is about the results of an independent, randomized 
blinded read of images collected in two previous studies, A01 and A03, at 5 imaging centers. The 
objectives of this trial were:
• To test whether a qualitative read of a PET scan collected at 30-40 minutes post-injection (the 30-
minute image) provides equivalent results to a qualitative read of a PET scan collected at 50-60 minutes 
post-injection (the 50-minute image).
• To compare the results of a semi-quantitative read of the 30-minute image to a semiquantitative read 
of the 50-minute image.
• To measure and summarize inter-reader reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients) for qualitative 
and semi-quantitative assessments of the 30-minute images and 50-minute images.
• To measure and summarize SUVRs obtained from the 30-minute images and 50-minute images.
Results:
Using the majority qualitative read of the 3 readers, there was 100% agreement between the 30-minute 
image evaluation and the 50-minute image evaluation (100% agreement within each clinical diagnostic 
subgroup). Similarly, agreement measured using the kappa statistic was 100% for each diagnostic 
subgroup. Overall inter-reader reliability (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient) using the qualitative reads 
was observed to be 0.816 at both 30-minute and 50-minute post-injection time points. Using the median 
semi-quantitative read of the 3 readers, agreement between the 30-minute images and 50-minute 
images measured using the Cohen-Fleisser (quadratic) kappa statistic was 0.946 for the overall efficacy 
population. Correlation between the 30-minutes images and 50-minutes images semi-quantitative 
median reads was observed to be 0.948 which is highly statistically significant (1-sided p-value <0.0001). 
Overall inter-reader reliability (ICC) using the semi-quantitative reads was observed to be 0.812 at both 
the 30-minute and 50-minute post-injection time points. The average cortical to cerebellar SUVR values 
in AD patients, but not the HV subjects, show continual substantial increases from time zero through 30 
minutes post-administration, with only small changes thereafter up to 90 minutes post-injection. The 
time activity curve for YHV was similar to that for HV. The ratio of AD to HV cortical average SUVRs 
appeared relatively constant between 30 and 90 minutes, and the effect size using Cohen’s d were 
comparable at 30 and 50 minutes (3.25 and 2.84, respectively). Similar results were obtained comparing

AD subjects to YHV at 30 and 50 minutes. The correlation between the two time points, across all 
subjects analyzed, was 0.988 and was highly statistically significant (1-sided p-value <0.0001).
Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated that there is no significant difference between 
florbetapir-PET scans acquired at 30 and 50 minutes post-injection with respect to the blinded reader 
visual assessment or the SUVR quantitative analysis.
Study A09
This was an evaluation of physician training for interpretation of florbetapir-PET scans, in particular 
evaluation of inter-reader reliability using images from subjects with a clinical presentation of AD or MCI. 
This study was to evaluate an “in person” reader training program developed to educate physicians in the 
binary visual interpretation of florbetapir-PET images and using images previously collected in Study 
A05. The training program was evaluated by measuring the consistency (inter-reader agreement) of 
image assessment among readers trained in this program.
Results:
Inter-reader agreement was high for 6 of the 7 readers. One reader (reader 3) had a strong bias to rate 
scans as positive, and thus had low agreement (kappa=0.25) with the other readers. With the exception 
of this reader, median kappa values for individual reader compared to every other reader ranged from 
0.68 to 0.83 and each inter-reader comparison produced significantly higher than chance agreement, 
with p values <0.0001. The Fleiss’ kappa across all inter-reader comparisons was 0.61 (p<0.0001), and 
with reader 3 excluded, the overall kappa was 0.76 (p<0.0001) indicating excellent agreement across 
readers for the binary read in the population of interest. This study also demonstrated the consistency of 
the reader results as compared to the majority read; kappa statistics comparing individual reader results 
to the majority read were generally near perfect (values ranging from 0.75 to 0.95, excluding reader 3) 
and agreement between individual readers and the median read ranged from 88% to 98%. Overall 
(including reader 3), 89% (248/280) of individual reads agreed with the majority read. Excluding reader 
3, 93% (223/240) of individual reads agreed with the majority read.
Conclusions: The results of study A09 indicate that the proposed reader training methodology, using a 
prospectively-defined binary visual rating scale, produces consistent image interpretation of florbetapir-
PET scans from patients with recently diagnosed MCI or clinical diagnosis of probable AD with 
mild/moderate dementia, patients not unlike those included in the population of intended florbetapir use.
Supportive studies concerning Diagnostic performance
Study A08 (“in-person” training program)
The objective of this study was to evaluate an “in-person” training programme developed to educate 
physicians in the binary visual interpretation of florbetapir-PET images on images from all 35 subjects 
who received florbetapir-PET scans and subsequently came to autopsy in study A07.
Results:
The median sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy across the 9 individual reviewers relative to the 
pathology reference standard (to estimate the neuritic plaque density) was 100%, 93.8% and 94.3% 
respectively. In addition, 8 of the 9 readers achieved greater than 90% accuracy relative to the reference 
standard. Overall, 96.2% of individual reads agreed with the majority read. The overall Fleiss’ kappa was 
0.85 (P < 0.0001) comparing multiple individual readers, indicating excellent reader-to-reader agreement.
Conclusions: The results of study A08 indicate that the proposed reader training methodology is effective 
in teaching readers how to accurately interpret florbetapir-PET scans using a prospectively-defined binary 
visual rating scale. In addition, the reader training methodology resulted in excellent interreader 
reproducibility using the binary assessment.

Study PT01 (web-based self-study reader training programme)
The primary objective of this study was to validate a web-based self-study reader training programme
that would be used to educate Nuclear Medicine and Radiology physicians in the methods of interpreting 
florbetapir PET scans in a standard clinical setting. The secondary objective was to demonstrate the 
sensitivity and specificity of reader assessments to estimate the neuritic plaque density following web-
based training using the florbetapir scans from subjects who came to autopsy in five individual readers.
Results:
The primary aim was to examine the inter-reader reliability in florbetapir PET scan interpretation. The 
Fleiss’ kappa statistic of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75 to 0.87) for the inter scans in the initially defined primary 
data set, exceeded the target value of 0.64 (95% LCI 0.58). The percent of image reads that were 
different from the majority of readers was 5.5% (95% CI: 4% to 7.7%). The kappa values for each 
individual reader relative to every other reader also exceeded the pre-specified target value of 0.64.
The secondary aim was to evaluate the performance of each of the five readers in florbetapir (18F) PET 
scan interpretation by calculating the sensitivity and specificity among those scans in patients with 
autopsy data to estimate the neuritic plaque density. In the All-Autopsy Population (comprised of scans 
from all 59 subjects that came to autopsy,) all 5 of the 5 readers achieved the protocol specified success 
criterion of lower bound of 95% confidence interval for both sensitivity and specificity > 0.50, relative to 
the autopsy reference standard. The median sensitivity and specificity across the 5 individual reviewers 
relative to the pathology reference standard were 82% and 95%, respectively. The lowest sensitivity was 
seen in Reader #3 with 69% (95% CI: 53.6% - 81.4%) and the lowest specificity was seen in Readers 
#1 and 2 with 90% (95% CI: 69.9% - 97.2%).
In the Autopsy Analysis Population (comprised of scans from those 46 subjects that came to autopsy 
within 12 months of having a PET scan) all 5 of the 5 readers again achieved the protocol specified 
success criterion of lower bound of 95% confidence interval for both sensitivity and specificity > 0.50, 
relative to the autopsy reference standard. The median sensitivity and specificity across the 5 individual 
reviewers relative to the pathology reference standard were 89% and 94%, respectively indicating that 
the performance for each reader was slightly higher in this population. In the All Autopsy population, 
which includes all autopsies even when they occurred greater than 12 months after PET scan (n=59), all 
five readers exceeded the pre-specified success criteria of lower bounds of a 95% CI for both sensitivity 
and specificity above 50%. The mean   (pooled, GEE) sensitivity and specificity were 82% and 93% 
respectively and the median   sensitivity and specificity for the five readers were 82% and 95%. 
The lowest sensitivity was seen in Reader #3 with 69% (95% CI: 53.6% - 81.4%) and the lowest 
specificity was seen in Readers #1 and 2 with 90% (95% CI: 69.9% - 97.2%).
The difference in sensitivity between the a.m. two populations was attributable to two patients, 054-001 
and 137-002 that were borderline positive for amyloid by neuropathology (highest neuritic plaque score 
in diagnostic regions 6 and 7 respectively, with a score of 6 required for a classification of moderate 
plaques) at autopsy 22 and 14 months, respectively, post scan. All 5 PET readers classified these cases 
as negative and post-hoc review of these cases confirms that they did not meet criteria for a positive 
scan.
Conclusion: in this study all pre-defined success criteria with respect to inter-reader reproducibility, intra-
reader reproducibility and sensitivity and specificity were met.
Study A04 (Test-retest reproducibility)
This study was done to evaluate test-retest reliability of florbetapir (18F) PET imaging. In fifteen clinical 
AD subjects and 10 healthy control subjects which were imaged twice less than 4 weeks apart.
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 48/78
There was a high degree of test-retest reproducibility. SUVRs were highly repeatable between test and 
retest image results for AD and control subjects whether comparing the 10-minute (50 to 60 minutes 
post-injection) or 20-minute (50 to 70 minutes post-injection) scans. SUVRs for the cortical average 
relative to cerebellum of test versus retest 20-minute scans were 1.42 ± 0.25 versus 1.41 ± 0.27 for AD 
subjects and 1.00 ± 0.06 versus 1.01 ± 0.06 for control subjects.
Conclusion: Results showed that: 1) test-retest reproducibility of florbetapir (18F) PET was good both in 
AD and control subjects, with intra-subject variance of <3% observed between the two scans, and 2) a 
10-minute florbetapir (18F) PET image provided equivalent results to a 20-minute image.  The rate of 
dose administration (slow versus fast injection) did not substantially alter the results for the 4 AD 
subjects.
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
For the validation of florbetapir (18F) as an imaging PET agent, two stages have to be considered:
a.
An initial phase in which it is established how well (the relevant types of) brain β–amyloid 
deposition can be visualized and quantified by florbetapir (18F) in the relevant areas.
b.
Further development where the efforts are aimed at demonstrating which particular practical 
purpose(s) the imaging is useful for and how this is achieved, i.e. for a particular use in clinical practice.
Those two stages were attempted in the pivotal study A07 and its follow-up extension study A16 using 
histopathology as the standard of truth. The approach using autopsy data as standard of truth is 
acceptable to demonstrate that the results obtained with the investigational diagnostic agent are valid for 
estimation of the Aβ deposition (quantity and topography).  Such standard of truth, without considering 
the dementia status and the patient age, is however not acceptable for establishing the 
probable/definitive diagnosis of AD.
The choice of endpoints and populations of the pivotal studies was discussed by the CHMP SAWP   which 
considered how the choice of the “end-of-life” population and healthy subjects for the primary analyses 
has an impact on the external validity of the pivotal study, and the diagnostic utility in the intended 
clinical population has to be established.
The overall study design of pivotal study A07 was acceptable, including the primary correlation analysis. 
The co-primary analysis of specificity in healthy controls is adequate to rule out false positive scans, but 
conclusions on external validity are limited to the enrolled population for this analysis, which may not 
reflect real life population.
The statistical methods used in the pivotal study A07 are considered appropriate. The main change in 
study conduct was the use of first 6 patients with autopsy results as test cases to refine methods which is 
acceptable. Their results were not included in the primary analysis. Changes to the statistical analysis 
plan were considered acceptable and had no impact on the interpretation of the study results.
The overall study design of pivotal study A16, which was implemented as an extension study of protocol 
A07 to include further patients from the study 07 autopsy cohort, was also acceptable. Statistical 
methods for analysis and calculation of confidence intervals are considered appropriate. The number of 
readers, however, was changed from 3 to 5 in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The motivation for this 
change was not described and the change in readers was not implemented by amendment in the study 
protocol. Several changes to the study protocol were implemented via amendment, including change of a 
co-primary aim of the study. This reflects the change in focus towards a sensitivity/ specificity analysis. 
An influence of the protocol amendments on the conduct of the study is, however, unlikely.
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 49/78
The pivotal study A07 and its extension study A16 have however the following limitations:
1.
For practical reasons, the participants recruited in the autopsy cohort had a  prerequisite of an 
anticipated life expectancy ≤6 months (resulting in patients with very different pathologies: cancer, heart 
failure, as well as pre-defined dementia and other non-dementia medical conditions). Even if they were 
age-matched population to the AD population, their end-of-life status could impact on their brains in 
unanticipated ways, reflecting neither the actual range/distribution of brain β–amyloid deposits nor the 
cognitive status expected in the intended population for routine clinical use of florbetapir (18F).  This 
limitation was also discussed in the Scientific Advice. There is the possibility that their clinical diagnosis of 
dementia subtype (if any) is inaccurate, as settled only on the basis of previous clinical history and a brief 
cognitive battery at the screening visit without mandatorily performing either MRI or other laboratory 
tests to exclude the presence of either significant white matter disease or other non-neurodegenerative 
dementias.
2.
In 93 out of 152 recruited patients, brain CT images were not available.  However, the remaining 
59 patients had PET images acquired or fused (manually or automatically) with CT images, and then 
structural information (cortical atrophy) from CT images was available at PET reading and may have 
influenced the PET’s reader decision. This was addressed by the  CHMP request to couple a co-registered 
CT/MRI scan if needed to correctly assign the position of the grey matter.
3.
Study A16 was designed as an extension of pivotal study A07 in order to reach a more significant 
sample size. However, the main objective of study A16 did not respect the original aim of analyzing the 
correlation between PET imaging and pathology and was expanded to include also diagnostic 
performance.  Moreover, the first 6 subjects to come to autopsy in study A07 were included in the 
efficacy population in study A16 whenever they had been recruited exclusively to refine the study 
methods and then excluded from the efficacy population in study A07.  The number of raters for 
qualitative evaluation of PET images in study A16 increased from study A07 (5 vs 3), which might result 
in greater indices of sensitivity and specificity because the final rating used to establish sensitivity and 
specificity was that expressed by the majority of readers.
4.
Three different methods of PET image interpretation were implemented for different statistical 
analyses: visual qualitative binary, visual semi-quantitative and quantitative.  The qualitative method 
(the one to be adopted) changed between the pivotal study and its extension  (different color scale, 
different reference area, and different interpretation criteria).  Histopathological techniques used (IHC 
and the Bielschowsky silver staining method) are well-accepted for the assessment of β-amyloid 
deposition in the brain postmortem and, as stated by the company, performed according to previously 
published standardized methods.  However,
-
The six brain regions to read were chosen to match with those regions involved in the 
quantitative PET reading method.  Each region might have a probability of significant β–amyloid 
deposition. Only 3 of those 6 regions are accepted for the confirmatory diagnosis of AD at autopsy.
-
The Bielschowsky method requires that a neuropathologist usually counts the number of 
stained neuritic plaques in an autopsy brain specimen, and then inter-reader agreement becomes crucial 
but was not confirmed.
The company should continue to develop and validate a quantitative PET reading methodology based on 
their product.
The pivotal studies did not address the impact on diagnostic thinking or on patient management of 
florbetapir (18F) PET, and this should be further explored.
Therefore, the choice of primary endpoints in pivotal studies A07 and A16 allows, by comparison to the 
histopathology, only conclusions on correlation on the brain β–amyloid deposition (combining both

neuritic and diffuse plaques) and diagnostic performance (as implemented by additional exploratory 
analyses in supportive studies A08 and PT01) related to the brain β–amyloid neuritic plaque density. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses
Diagnostic Performance
In two pivotal studies A07 and its extension A16 diagnostic performance was evaluated using 
histopathology as the standard of truth. This approach using autopsy data as standard or truth is justified 
as it can demonstrate that the results obtained with the investigational diagnostic agent are valid for 
estimation of plaque detection, but not for diagnosis of a particular disease.
In pivotal study A07 the diagnostic performance of florbetapir (18F) PET imaging was evaluated in a 
population with a life expectancy of six months or less by a primary analysis of the comparability of 
florbetapir (18F) PET with histopathology. Semi-quantitative florbetapir measurements of the amyloid 
burden were compared with histopathological levels of amyloid burden determined at autopsy. 
152 subjects were enrolled from various end-of-life (e.g., hospice/hospital/nursing home) and late-life 
(longitudinal studies of aging) populations to yield 35 autopsies within 1 year following the PET imaging 
procedure. At the end of the study 29 of 37 subjects who had died were the primary analysis population 
(withdrawal in 2 cases and 6 subjects were used in a front-runner analysis).
The correlation (Spearman’s ρ of 0.78, p<0.0001, 95% CI: 0.58 - 0.89) was assessed between 
florbetapir-PET (semiquantitative PET reading) and histopathologic measurements of β-amyloid by IHC 
(combining neuritic and diffuse plaques). However, of the 19 (of 35) subjects which met neuropathologic 
modified CERAD criteria for AD only 18 were florbetapir-PET scan positive, whereas all 19 were 
considered positive by quantitative analysis (i.e. in one neuropathologic positive case the visual PET 
interpretation was negative).
Considering the clinical dementia diagnoses of 23 end-of-life patients, in 3 cases the clinical diagnosis did 
not match the final autopsy diagnosis: one subject with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD was negative 
for AD at autopsy; two other subjects with a clinical diagnosis of other dementing disorders than AD (one 
each with Parkinson’s disease dementia and Lewy body dementia) were positive for AD at autopsy. The 
clinical diagnoses in this end-of-life population are likely to be inaccurate, as discussed above. This 
outcome shows, however, the necessity of an additional validated test supporting the clinical decision 
making. The true histopathologic status of the subjects remains unclear (until post mortem), as it is
possible to have β-amyloid deposition in the brain without any cognitive symptoms.
The specificity of florbetapir-PET to identify the absence of amyloid plaque deposition was additionally 
evaluated in a cohort of 47 young healthy controls (HC). In this population the qualitative visual PET 
rating was 100% negative, thereby establishing that clinically defined negatives can be confirmed 
negative by florbetapir-PET in healthy subjects. The true histopathologic status of these subjects is 
however unclear as it is possible to have β-amyloid deposition in the brain without any symptoms 
regarding cognition.
Limitations of study 07 were the use of end-of life patients and YHC instead of the population of intended 
use, that the performed correlation statistic (between florbetapir and β-amyloid) is not directly 
translatable into diagnostic performance statistics, that the semi-quantitative visual PET read training did 
not define criteria for readers to classify images as positive versus negative which is needed for 
measuring diagnostic performance and that the size of the autopsy population was too small to set tight 
confidence intervals around sensitivity and specificity measurements.

The pivotal study A16 included additional subjects from the A07 study end of life population who 
consented to autopsy and died within 24 months of the florbetapir-PET scan. It was designed to 
overcome the fact that the size of the autopsy population was too small to set tight confidence intervals 
around sensitivity and specificity measurements. 24 more subjects were included and a pooled data a set 
of 59 subjects was analysed which had both valid florbetapir-PET images and autopsy data.   Primary 
objectives of study A16 were 1.) to determine the correlation between the visual semi-quantitative read 
of florbetapir (18F) PET scan and quantitative assessement of amyloid burden at autopsy by IHC (staining 
and counting both neuritic and diffuse plaques) and also 2.) to assess sensitivity and specificity of a 
binary visual read (positive or negative) of the florbetapir-PET scan in relation to the histopathology 
diagnosis (the estimation of the neuritic plaque density) as standard of truth.
This study aimed at demonstrating correlation between uptake by the whole cortex on florbetapir (18F) 
PET images (evaluated by three readers on a 5-point semiquantitative visual scale) and the quantitative 
measurement by IHC at pathology as an appropriate gold standard.  Achieving success required a 
statistical significant (p≤0.05) clinically irrelevant correlation of only Spearman’s ρ>0.  The actual 
correlation was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.85, p<0.0001), similar to the correlation versus the neuritic 
plaque density measured at autopsy by the Bielschowksy method (ρ=0.71) on an exploratory analysis 
but inferior to that obtained in vitro (ρ=0.88, p<0.0001, n=47).
On the other hand, the true β–amyloid burden by IHC was very variable and overlapped for most 
semiquantitative PET rates.  Almost no subjects were considered as PET rating 2.  Moreover, by using the 
median of the semiquantitative PET rating measured by 3 independent readers, a biased greater 
correlation might have been obtained because the attenuation produced by the lack of reproducibility 
across readers has been diminished. Indeed, the interreader agreement was only moderate 
(kappa=0.47) between reader 1 and 2 while mildly substantial (kappa values of 0.64 and 0.62) for the 
other paired readers.  This underlines the importance of appropriate reader training.
When PET images were quantitatively read, correlation of uptake by PET (averaging 6 prespecified 
cortical regions) versus the measurement by IHC or Bielschowsky was ρ=0.75 (p<0.0001). 
In this study, the prespecified hypotheses with respect to sensitivity and specificity were confirmed and a 
sensitivity of 92% (78%-98%) and specificity of 100% (80%-100%) was shown (data with 95% CI) to 
estimate the neuritic plaque density. Concerning subjects with positive modified CERAD neuropathology 
diagnosis, 36 subjects were correctly identified as PET positives while 3 subjects were falsely rated as PET 
negative. Concerning subjects with negative modified CERAD neuropathology diagnosis a diagnostic 
agreement was found in 20 of 20 subjects rated as PET negative with no subjects declared as false 
positive. Diagnostic performance in this population translates into a Negative Predictive Value (95% CI) 
of 87% (65%-97%) for patients with negative results at PET, and a Positive Predictive Value (95% CI) of 
100% (88%-100%) for PET positive patients. These results provide strong support that florbetapir-PET 
images estimate the neuritic plaque density in the brain with high sensitivity (92%) and specifity (100%).
Although the expected sensitivity and specificity (>80%) of the qualitative PET reading was met, it might 
be biased due to the already mentioned five study limitations and the following ones:
1.
By using the majority of the qualitative PET rating of 5 independent readers for the analysis of 
sensitivity and specificity, the inter-reader variability was obscured.  On an exploratory analysis in study 
A16 it was seen that the inter-reader agreement was almost perfect (kappa≥0.82, p<0.0001) for all 
reader comparisons except those for reader 5.  Sensitivity and negative predictive value of this reader 
was as low as 69% while for the other four readers were closed to the majority analysis (87-95%).
2.
Sensitivity and specificity in study A16 was calculated versus an endpoint called “final pathologic 
diagnosis of AD” or also called “binary neuropathology diagnosis” made at autopsy, which is neither the 
Amyvid

gold standard nor an acceptable reference standard.  It is a non-validated subjective interpretation of the 
standardized widely used post-mortem CERAD criteria for the definitive diagnosis of AD. The company 
modified these CERAD criteria to convert the semiquantitative assessment of neuritic plaques of 3 
particular neocortical areas directly into a neuropathologic diagnosis of AD, notwithstanding patient age 
or clinical information regarding the presence or absence of dementia.  This way, the “final pathologic 
diagnosis of AD” just refers to the presence of moderate/frequent or none/sparse neuritic plaque density 
and not to the definitive diagnosis of AD. The clinical relevance of this endpoint is unknown (when and in 
what clinical circumstances the detection of beta-amyloid deposition is useful).
Quantitative measurement of brain florbetapir (18F) retention performed in 6 pre-specific cortical regions, 
and averaged for the whole brain, yielded better results of sensitivity and specificity: 97% (CI 85-100%) 
and 100% (CI 80-100%), respectively.
Additional data show a significant positive correlation between the florbetapir-PET visual semi-
quantitative rating on a 5-point scale (from 0 =no amyloid to 4 =high levels of amyloid) and the 
neuropathology diagnoses.  Data from the pivotal studies A07 and A16 were further assessed in the 
supportive studies A08 and PT01, in which different sets of readers interpreted images from the A07/A16 
study autopsy subjects using similar criteria of PET positivity/negativity of than in study A16 to calculate 
diagnostic performance of the visual binary PET reading.  However, readers trained (“in-person” and 
“web-based”, respectively) were different than the in-person training in study A16 (see table below). For 
limitations of the training methods implemented during florbetapir (18F) development clinical program, 
see discussion hereinafter.

In Study PT01 an additional 5 nuclear medicine physicians, with no previous experience in amyloid 
imaging, completed an interactive web-based reader training program before conducting a blinded binary 
image interpretation of 151 subject scans. These scans included the 59 autopsy case images from Study 
A16 randomized together with 92 subject scans from AD, MCI, and HC subjects of Study A05.  In Study 
PT01 results from the autopsy cases were less convincing about diagnostic performance when compared 
to Study A16 with 5 false negative cases with negative PET results and 1 false positive case with positive 
PET scan. This translates into a NPV of 79% (58%-93%) for subjects with negative PET results and a PPV 
97% (85%-100%) for subjects with positive PET results in the population under study (data with exact 
binomial 95% CIs).  Overall Kappa for all interrater comparisons was high (0.81 (0.75-0.87))
In Study A08, nine independent Nuclear Medicine readers, with no previous experience in amyloid 
imaging, provided binary interpretations of the florbetapir-PET scans from the original 35 cases that came 
to autopsy in Study A07. Readers underwent an “in-person” training slightly modified for Study A16 (see 
table above).  Sensitivity and specificity in study A08 were calculated for each reader by comparing a 
binary read (positive or negative) of the florbetapir-PET scan in relation to the histopathology diagnosis 
as standard of truth. The median sensitivity and specificity across the 9 individual reviewers relative to 
the estimation of the neuritic plaque density was 100% and 93.8% respectively and 8 of the 9 readers 
achieved greater than 90% accuracy relative to the reference standard. Two readers (#5 and #6) had

lower results for specificity (#5) or sensitivity (#6). Overall Kappa for all interrater comparisons was high 
(0.85) and the results of study A08 are more convincing than the inter-reader comparisons from study 
A16. Outcome of this study is that a reader training for interpretation of florbetapir-PET scans can lead to 
high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in the binary interpretation of flobetapir-PET scan images.
In total, diagnostic performance (sensitivity and specificity) to estimate the neuritic plaque density has 
been investigated for a total of 19 readers (9 in A08, 5 in A16 and 5 in PT01) for the 35 autopsy cases 
from Study A07, including 10 readers (5 in A16 and 5 in PT01) for all 59 autopsy cases from Study A16. 
Results show that readings of single individual readers can deviate from the majority read and this 
finding emphasizes the importance of reader training.
Clinical usefulness
The ability of a positive florbetapir-PET scan to differentiate patients with clinical diagnosis of AD, of MCI 
and HC was the objective of Phase 2 study A05 and its clinical follow-up extension -the longitudinal study 
A11- which actually aimed to evaluate the risk of cognitive deterioration or progression to AD. It has to 
be taken into account that in these studies no histopathological confirmation of imaging results could be 
obtained. The reference standard in this setting is the clinical evaluation only (since nor other biomarkers 
have been measured), which is not an appropriate reference to support claims for neither imaging AD 
pathology nor AD diagnosis, and the link to populations of known brain amyloid status (autopsy study, 
YHC) has to be justified.  Moreover, enrolled subjects do not encompass the overall anticipated 
population in which florbetapir (18F) will be used. Indeed, not all tests standardized for management of 
patients suspected of AD (e.g. concurrent MRI, blood tests, …) were followed to confirm the absence of 
systemic disorders or other brain diseases that in and of themselves could account for the progressive 
cognitive impairment. For all these reasons, neither study A05 nor study A11 directly support the 
proposed indication for use.
Study A05 represents a clinical scenario where amyloid imaging (both quantitative and binary qualitative 
read) is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. 75.6% of subjects with clinical diagnosis of probable AD 
with mild/moderate dementia, 38.3 % of patients with cognitive impairment of non-obvious cause lasting 
less than 12 months and even 14.1% of cognitively normal subjects were Aβ positive. The numbers for 
AD are slightly below the expected prevalence of amyloid-negative individuals in a clinically diagnosed AD 
population, based on literature reports of the false positive rate for the clinical diagnosis of AD versus 
autopsy. Lim et al. (1999) reported that 20% of clinically-diagnosed AD subjects did not have AD at 
autopsy and lacked amyloid pathology and Pearl et al. (1997) reported that 23% of clinically diagnosed 
AD subjects did not have AD at autopsy and lacked amyloid pathology.
The observation that 38.3% of MCI subjects were positive by florbetapir-PET scan is consistent with the 
autopsy literature that shows 33% to 62% of MCI subjects are positive at post-mortem examination 
(Bennett, 2005; Petersen, 2006). Finally, the observation that 14.1% of HC were rated as positive on 
visual read of the florbetapir-PET scan is consistent with literature reports that 13% to 45% of apparently 
cognitively healthy subjects have significant β-amyloid pathology at autopsy (Hulette et al 1998, Davis et 
al 1999, Price et al 1999, Schmitt et al 2000, Knopman et al 2003, Aizenstein et al 2008) and also 
consistent with findings from other PET amyloid tracers (Mintun, 2006; Jagust, 2010).
Amyloid imaging detects brain pathophysiology but in itself does not make a clinical diagnosis. Overall 
there was only a weak correlation between generally used cognitive tests such as ADAS-cog and ADCS-
ADL and PET uptake in the MCI and AD group in this study.
Study A11, was developed to help to understand the clinical relevance of detecting a pathologically 
significant density of Aβ neuritic plaques and specifically to determine whether florbetapir (18F) is 
predictive of cognitive decline by following subjects from study A05 over a 36-month period.  However, 
the design of this study does not allow estimating the risk of MCI progression to clinical AD.

Study A11 is an extension of study A05 and subjects in A11 were previously enrolled in Study A05. 
The primary analysis focuses on a longitudinal analysis of conversion from MCI at baseline to AD or CN in 
subjects with PET positive and PET negative. The planned analysis is an interim analysis at 18 of 36 
months, but the study concluded during this application and some preliminary final results at the 36-
month follow-up were also presented.
Although the primary aim of the study is clinically very relevant, the power of the study is considered to 
be rather low. With full enrolment and the assumptions the applicant presents (60 MCI patients with one 
half with positive PET scan and one half with negative PET scan, population MCI to AD conversion rate 
15% for 18-month period) the study would have a power of 75% for a conversion ratio of 8/1 for PET 
positive and PET negative subjects, respectively. For a conversion ratio of 7/2 for PET positive and PET 
negative subjects, respectively, the power would be only 41%. Actually the A11 protocol enrolled only 51 
MCI patients and this further diminishes the power.  Of the originally 31 subjects with AD, 51 subjects 
with MCI, and 69 CN subjects that were enrolled, 27 subjects with AD, 46 subjects with MCI, and 67 CN 
subjects completed the study as of month 18. Overall these numbers are considered to be very low.
At 36-month follow-up, of the patients who had been clinically diagnosed with MCI at study entry, 9 
(19%) converted to clinical AD.  This value is not particularly remarkable since studies have shown that 
MCI progresses to dementia at a rate of about 10% to 15% per year (Petersen 2007; Plassman et al 
2008). Those who have amnestic mild cognitive impairment (prodromal AD) or prodromal vascular 
dementia (those who have had at least 1 stroke) make the conversion to dementia at an even more rapid 
rate of 17% to 20% per year.
Of 17 MCI patients at baseline who had a positive PET scan, 6 (35%) were diagnosed with clinical 
probable AD 36 months later compared to 3 (10%) of 30 who had a negative scan.  Sensitivity of Amyvid 
scan to show the MCI conversion rate to AD in 9 converters was 66.7% (95% CI: 35-88%), specificity in 
38 non-converters was 71.0% (95% CI: 55-83%) and positive likelihood ratio was 2.31 (95% CI: 1.2-
4.5%).  But it has to be taken into account that most of the patients had an unchanged MCI status after 
36 months irrespective of amyloid status (58.8% with positive PET and 73.3 % with negative PET). 
Moreover, 16.7 % (n=5) patients converted to a cognitive normal status at the 36-month follow-up.
Predictive values ratios provide information on the probability that a subject may in fact have the disease 
when the test is positive. Alternatively, likelihood ratios, when used in the context of diagnostic 
assessment, provides an estimate of how much a test result will change the odds of having (or not 
having) the disease. Both parameters are considered to be appropriate endpoints to evaluate the 
diagnostic performance of a diagnostic agent (CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev1.). The PPV in the MCI population 
is low and the +LR is at the lower threshold of modest incremental improvement. Positive likelihood 
ratios between 2 and 5 are considered to provide modest incremental improvements to the ultimate 
diagnosis while likelihood ratios of greater than 5 provide a significant improvement 
(EMEA/H/SAB/005/1/FU/2/QA/2011).
Of the 51 patients initially diagnosed with MCI only 19 had a positive PET scan (37.3%).  The positive 
lilkelihood ratio of florbetapir (18F) for agreement with baseline diagnosis of MCI was 1.20.
Furthermore, of the 31 patients initially diagnosed with AD 10 had a negative PET scan. Taken out the 
one patient who after 18 months had non-AD dementia this means that only 70% (21/30) of clinically AD 
patients had a positive PET scan which is below the expected rate of histopathologically confirmed AD 
based on literature data (Lim et al 1999, Pearl et al 1997). An alternative explanation for the lower 
sensitivity in the AD group of study A11 may be attributed to a bias for selective dropout of subjects with 
positive scans. 10 of the 31 study participants with diagnosis of AD dementia might indeed have had 
another etiologic diagnosis. Apart from that recent publications report that the binding patterns of tracers 
Amyvid
Assessment report

may be affected by atypical amyloidβ assembly structure or plaque organization which might also 
increase the potential for false-negative scans (Ringman JM et al. The exception makes the rule. Not all 
Aβ plaques are created equal; Neurology 2012; 79:206-207; Schöll M et al. Low PiB PET retention in 
presence of pathologic CSF biomarkers in Arctic APP mutation carriers: Neurology 2012: 79:229-236).
Overall, the available data after 36 months do not support that amyloid detection alone allows accuracy 
for diagnosis of AD or other cognitive diseases nor prognostic accuracy. Respective wording was 
introduced in sections 4.1 and 4.4 of the SmPC. Unfortunately, no correlation with other potential 
biomarkers (CSF β42amyloid, tau, hippocampal volume) was provided. On the other hand, a prognosis 
indication is not the requested intended use for florbetapir (18F) at the moment.
Impact on diagnostic thinking
The potential of florbetapir-PET to impact diagnostic thinking was investigated in study A13. After 
reviewing the clinical case report (blinded to the initial clinical diagnosis made by the enrolling physician 
in A05), and prior to receiving information about the patient´s florbetapir-PET amyloid imaging results, 
the expert´s diagnosis indicated either cognitive impairment of indeterminate origin or suggested an 
origin inconsistent with PET scan results (e.g., dementia due to AD in a patient with an amyloid negative 
PET scan) in 59% of the 44 cases (range 50-66%). When presented with the florbetapir-PET scan results, 
these experts changed their diagnosis in 85% (range 66-100%) of the cases with indeterminate origin or 
inconsistent with PET scan results. This represented a significant shift in diagnostic thinking (p <0.001, 
95% CI 80-100%).
When evaluating these data it has to be taken into account that only two of the three physicians changed 
diagnosis in nearly every case where the algorithm classified the scan result as inconsistent with pre-scan 
diagnosis. The third clinician differed from the other two primarily in the evaluation of cases given a pre-
scan diagnosis MCI of indeterminate aetiology or dementia of indeterminate aetiology. When the 
florbetapir-PET was  positive, this clinician changed the diagnosis to indicate an impairment likely due to 
AD, but when the scan was negative this clinician maintained a diagnosis of indeterminate aetiology 
(rather than unlikely due to AD). So in clinical practice a negative scan may not change diagnostic 
thinking.
The subgroup of 44 subjects with cognitive impairment included, from those previously recruited in study 
A05, are likely not representative of the population in whom this radiopharmaceutical has demonstrated 
diagnostic performance (who are still pending to be confirmed), not even of the intended population.  
Neither the impact was assessed in the particular diagnostic purpose in which the test has been validated 
(which is none yet) to judge whether changes in patient management are likely to be based on correct 
test results or in scan interpretation errors.  Nor was assessed for the intended diagnostic purpose (i.e. to 
change a pretest diagnosis of “suspected but not confirmed diagnosis of AD” to a posttest one of either 
“confirmed diagnosis of AD pathology” or “excluded diagnosis of AD”).
Because of its retrospective design and of the absence of longitudinal observations, this study might 
show the potential impact, but it would NOT report the actual impact florbetapir (18F) PET imaging has on
diagnostic thinking.  Indeed, the experts did not decide to request the test, as happens in clinical practice, 
and just reviewed all participants in which the test was mandatorily done as recruited for a clinical trial.  
Nor did they have option to interview the patient or to ask for any particular additional specific test, 
especially considering that this radiopharmaceutical is intended to be used in combination to other 
diagnostic evaluations (not defined yet).
The guideline on clinical evaluation of diagnostic agents (CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev. 1) establishes as a 
requirement on study data for new diagnostic agents, that “……relevant impact on diagnostic thinking 
and/or patient management in the appropriate clinical context should be demonstrated, if therapeutic 
Amyvid
Assessment report

Page 57/78
consequences of the diagnosis obtained with a new agent are not obvious, or the benefit/risk balance is 
unclear…..”. This applies to florbetapir (18F) although this has not been demonstrated for this diagnostic 
agent.
As therapeutic consequences of the diagnosis of labelling brain β-amyloid are not obvious, the company 
is recommended to perform a study to assess the impact on diagnostic thinking and patient 
management.
These findings have an impact on the initially proposed indication: the wording of the indication refers to 
“AD pathology” (AD-P), expression referring to a pathology which is a still non-validated entity, and it is 
different from clinical AD (AD-C) (Jack et al 2011) and implies furthermore that the detection of amyloid 
plaques with PET scan can be regarded as a reliable biomarker for AD pathology. The wording of the 
indication continues that a negative scan on the other hand makes the diagnosis of AD unlikely. Here two 
distinct domains although pathopysiologically connected are mixed. Recently the National Institute on 
Aging and the Alzheimer´s Association workgroups published a consensus for a revision of diagnostic and 
research criteria for AD, which are still non validated. Whereas the original NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (Mc 
Khann e al. 1984) assumed that AD is a clinical-pathological entity the new criteria take into account that 
AD dementia is part of a continuum of clinical and biological phenomena (McKhann et al 2011).  
Accordingly, in the revised NIA-Alzheimer ‘Association criteria, a semantic and conceptual distinction is 
made between AD pathophysiological process (AD-P) and the clinical manifestation (AD-C) (Jack et al 
2011, Dubois et al. 2010).
The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that accumulation of Aβ is the key pathological step in the 
pathogenesis of AD (Karran et al 2011). However, imperfect correlation between cognitive status and Aβ 
deposits in brain have been described (Golde at al 2011) as amyloid deposition can also occur in normal 
aging as well (Davis et al 1999, Price et al 1999, Knopman et al 2003, Aizenstein et al 2008) and amyloid 
pathology has been observed in autopsy brains of older persons without dementia (Bennett et al 2006). 
β-amyloid plaques may also be present in patients with MCI, with other dementias (dementia of Lewy 
Body, Parkinson disease dementia), Niemann-Pick disease type C and severe brain injury.  This has led to 
the view that Aβ is only one of the factors that causes AD and that other non Aβ factors also contribute to 
AD (Pimplikar et al 2009).  Indeed, pre-specified levels of age-related brain neuritic β-amyloid plaque at 
autopsy should be integrated with the presence of a clinical history of dementia to arrive at a diagnostic 
level of certainty with regard to AD (Mirra et al. 1991).
Aβ-accumulation may reach a plateau early in the course of the disease and does not change much with 
disease progression. This makes amyloid an useful marker for early diagnosis of AD pathology, but not 
for determining further prognosis (van Rossum et al 2012). Genetic, other pathological and 
environmental factors could modulate progression, disease course and manifestation of illness. Factors 
that enhance neuroplasticity may make an individual more resistant to and delay clinical manifestations 
of the illness (Golde et al 2011). Protective factors also exist which may modify a relationship between Aβ 
pathology and clinical expression of cognitive impairment (Quigley et al 2011).
The last statement of the indication is crucial since it may trigger decisions that patients with clinical 
features of AD may not be treated on the basis of these findings. Although florbetapir (18F) imaging is 
not proposed as a stand-alone diagnostic tool for the definitive diagnosis of AD its role in the clinical 
setting has to be more clearly defined. Amyloid imaging only captures one aspect of Alzheimer pathology 
and does not assess other potentially important changes in CSF tau and other markers. No correlation 
with other biomarkers has been shown in the intended population and it remains unclear how to grade 
conflicting results. Taking all this into account the following revised indication is proposed:
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 58/78
Amyvid is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of β-amyloid 
neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated 
for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive impairment. Amyvid should be used in 
conjunction with a clinical evaluation. 
A negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD. For the 
limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, see sections 4.4 and 5.1.
It is clearly indicated that it has to be prescribed by physicians skilled in the clinical management 
neurodegenerative disorders.
The SmPC recommends a dose of 370 MBq of florbetapir (18F) with a total volume not exceeding 10 mL 
given as an IV bolus administration, and to acquire a 10-minute PET image starting approximately 30 to 
50 minutes after injection.  The only dose finding trial was the study A03. Although both tested activities 
(111 and 370 MBq) allowed to subjective visual differentiation of uptake (positive or negative) between 
mild/moderate clinical AD and cognitively healthy subjects with acceptable image quality, the highest 
dose was chosen for the phase III and subsequent trials. However, the lowest dose would have been 
enough for visual PET interpretation avoiding exposition to an excessive dose of radioactive.
Quantitative measurements of PET images showed consistent uptake levels in the time period between 
30-90 minutes postinjection, with clear separation between activity in cortical target areas and 
cerebellum in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD beginning around 15 minutes after dosing but not in 
the control subjects.  The florbetapir (18F) uptake at 50-60 minutes postadministration in clinical AD 
subjects and controls should be justified on the basis of concordance with histopathology, particularly if 
the target(s) are amyloid plaques which occupy cortical gray matter exclusively.  This pattern consisted 
on the highest SUV values appearing in the centre semiovale white matter similarly in both AD and 
controls independently of the dose, a high SUV in the neocortex and putamen in AD patients, and in 
normal cognitively controls a high SUV in both basal ganglia, pons and hippocampus.
The primary source for characterisation of the time window for image acquisition was the study A06 in AD 
patients and cognitively normal subjects.  There was agreement/correlation between the 30-40 min and 
50-60 min time points for the qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative PET interpretation. The 
applicant presented data in study A04 showing that there is demonstrated test-retest reproducibility of 
PET findings AD and controls in a time interval of 4 weeks.  Results from image acquisition of 10-minutes 
showed to be similar to a 20 -minute period.
Despite all this above, the selected activity of florbetapir (18F) to inject and the time window for image 
acquisition could not be useful for the full spectrum of intended population but only to the subjects with 
mild/moderate AD by clinical criteria with mild/moderate dementia.  Neither patients with any type of 
cognitive impairment without dementia nor patients with probable AD severely demented were recruited.  
The reason for selection of the six brain regions to consider on the quantitative PET interpretation 
methods (either as target or reference areas) was provided, and the 3 regions to be assessed for the 
confirmatory diagnosis of AD were included amongst them.
Concerning interpretation of PET images, three distinct methods have been used during the development 
programme: a binary qualitative visual, a semi-quantitative visual, and a quantitative one. The PET 
reading method to be considered for principal analysis, the scoring technique, the interpretation criteria 
and the readers’ training changed during the clinical development. In the most recent studies (A08, A09, 
A16 and PT01) and in the SmPC, the Applicant has chosen the binary qualitative method as principal for 
image PET reading, readers were trained in this methodology and inter-reader concordance addressed in 
different populations using different reference/truth standards. 
For the qualitative reading in pivotal study A16, which is the visual inspection method recommended in 
the SmPC, the visual global determination of whether the scan was positive or negative was used. An

influence of choice of the regions on the visual global determination of amyloids status by florbetapir 18F 
PET scan is not expected.
The chosen qualitative (binary) reading criteria of florbetapir (18F) PET scans as positive or negative to be 
used in clinical practice has inherent difficulties and is a real challenge.  First of all it has the difficulty of 
reading PET images of the brain, and secondly the difficulty derived from the intrinsic characteristics of a 
PET amyloid tracer.   The interpretation criteria in the binary method is looking at loss of reduction of 
contrast between white matter (with invariably high uptake) and grey matter (with either no 
radiopharmaceutical uptake (if normal) or some level of uptake (if abnormal)).  Traditional scanners in 
use today often lack the fine volumetric resolution and high-contrast ratio required to precisely 
differentiate between grey and white matter.  Because grey and white matters are interlaced in such a 
compact way, and also due to the short width of the grey matter (about 5 mm), distinguishing the two 
can be challenging.  Moreover, in cases where the uptake in grey matter is insufficient (as for example in 
borderline cases with insufficient intensity of amyloid deposition, or in cases with reduction of grey matter 
width as in brain atrophy), it may become challenging to accurately interpret florbetapir (18F) PET scans 
based on visual assessment.  
Statistics improve the accuracy of diagnosis beyond that attainable by a human observer who relies on a 
familiarity with image appearances in both health and disease.  The strength of this approach is that, no 
a priori hypothesis is required about which locations may be affected and the whole volume is 
automatically analyzed.  Comprehensive packages are available for statistical comparison of brain 
perfusion SPECT.  The differences between the normal database and the test subjects are expressed and, 
to help to interpretate the differences, functional images are displayed.  They may allow for a single 
subject diagnosis.
A methodology to distinguish white matter and grey matter in PET scans and to quantify the intensity of 
amyloid uptake in grey matter is important and is potentially achievable nowadays in clinical practice.  
The company already used a quantitative PET reading methodology in the clinical programme and has 
collaborated to the development of quantitative methodology software.  For all this, the CHMP highly 
recommends that the company should continue to develop and validate a quantitative reading PET 
methodology based on their product.
The company acknowledges that technical problems in the scan itself or in brain anatomy (levels of 
atrophy) can affect the anatomical location of the gray matter/white matter border and is important to 
consider in the interpretation of a florbetapir (18F) PET scan. They also suggest that CT scans may also be 
helpful for discerning anatomy in cases in which atrophy or a low quality scan complicate the PET-only 
image interpretation. Therefore, availability of a co-registered recent CT scan or MR image is highly 
recommended for the qualitative (binary) interpretation of florbetapir (18F) PET scans.  This has been 
included in the SmPC.
Due to the difficulties for visual qualitative interpretation of florbetapir (18F) PET scans, it is mandatory to 
complete an appropriate reader training prior to routine clinical image interpretation. The company says 
to be committed to providing high quality training in all countries where florbetapir (18F) is available, and 
that the training materials will be available in both in-person and electronic programmes in clinical 
practice.  The company assures that both training programmes will contain identical material to that used 
in 3 studies (A08, A16 and PT01), which were handicapped by lack of training on fused PET-CT images, a 
low number of cases and lack of qualification of readers after reading.
Only information from the electronic training programme, but not for the in-person training, has been 
recently supplied by the company by either digital means or via a log-in to www.amyvidtraining.com

(currently for clinical training use by US physicians) to be reviewed.  The CHMP expressed concerns about
the lack of readers’s validation after training and lack of training on PET-CT images.  Some training cases 
presented with drawbacks which might falsely influence the image interpretation: incorrect image 
orientation, images very noisy or very smooth, images of very low quality or serious misregistration PET-
CT.  These drawbacks should be addressed in the training programme.  
As the training programme on the visual qualitative reading method should be changed to be adapted to 
the European market (different indication wording than in the US, different languages), it should be 
improved as follows:

Information on amyloid pathology in Alzheimer Disease; relevant information on Amyvid as an β-
amyloid PET tracer, including the approved indication according to the SmPC, limitations of Amyvid use, 
interpretation errors, safety information and the results of clinical trials informing on the diagnostic use of 
Amyvid

Review of the PET reading criteria, including method of image review, criteria for interpretation, and 
images demonstrating the binary read methodology

The material should include Amyvid PET demonstration cases with correct PET scan interpretation by 
an experienced reader; Amyvid-PET scans for self-assessment; and a self-qualification procedure to be 
offered to each trainee. Training should include a sufficient number of clearly positive and negative cases 
as well as intermediate level cases. Cases should be histopathologically confirmed, if possible.

Expertise and qualification of trainers in both electronic and in-person training should be ensured.
This improvement of the training programme should be considered in parallel of the study which the 
company will conduct in the USA to assess the impact of different reader training methods on the 
reliability of Amyvid scan interpretations as they are performed in clinical practice and to help determine 
the performance of the reader training processes as compared to the experts at the central reading 
facility.
No efficacy subanalysis has been presented for the use of florbetapir (18F) in patients with atypical 
presentations of AD (asymmetric, frontal variants, posterior cortical degeneration and a single positive 
abnormal region).
The paediatric use of this radiopharmaceutical has neither been assessed nor expected. A product-
specific waiver for paediatric studies was granted.
No dedicated clinical studies have been presented to evaluate efficacy of florbetapir (18F) in patients with 
impaired renal function and impaired hepatic function.
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The primary evidence of efficacy of florbetapir-PET is derived from the diagnostic performance (i.e., 
sensitivity and specificity) reported in pivotal Study A16 using the binary read method (positive or 
negative) conducted by 5 independent academic nuclear medicine physicians. This is the read method 
proposed in the SPC for clinical use. The florbetapir-PET scan was compared to autopsy as standard of 
truth for detection of pathologically significant density of Aβ neuritic plaques (i.e. moderate to frequent 
neuritic plaque density).
In this study, a sensitivity of 92% (78%-98%) and specificity of 100% (80%-100%) was shown for 
detection of pathologically significant density of Aβ neuritic plaques (data with 95% CI). 36 subjects with 
positive modified CERAD neuropathology diagnosis were correctly identified as PET positive while 3 
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 61/78
subjects were falsely rated as PET negative. A diagnostic agreement was found in 20 of 20 subjects with 
negative modified CERAD neuropathology diagnosis rated as PET negative with no subjects declared as 
false positive. Due to the limited number of subjects, confidence intervals have considerable width.
Another evidence of efficacy is the correlation of florbetapir-PET read results with total amyloid (both 
neuritic and diffuse plaques) by histopathology at autopsy initially evaluated in the first 35 autopsy 
subjects in pivotal Study A07 and later expanded in Study A16 to include all 59 autopsy cases. A 
statistically significant and relevant correlation between the semi-quantitative image assessment and the 
quantitative amyloid levels measured at autopsy was found. Additionally, in YHC subjects in the pivotal 
Study A07 a specificity (with 95% CI) of 100% (91-100%) was observed. 47 of the 47 subjects in the 
specificity cohort were correctly rated as PET negative by the majority read of three readers.
The selection of an “end-of-life” population and healthy subjects for the primary analyses in the pivotal 
studies implies that extrapolation of the efficacy results to the intended target population for florbetapir 
application would be necessary.
However, the two pivotal studies in end-of-life patients have limitations which might have biased their 
main results.
The sensitivity and specificity of florbetapir-PET for detection of moderate to frequent neuritic plaque 
density was further confirmed in two supportive studies A08 and PT01, in which different sets of readers 
interpreted images from the A07/A16 study autopsy subjects. In total, diagnostic performance 
(sensitivity and specificity) has been investigated for a total of 19 readers (9 in A08, 5 in A16 and 5 in 
PT01) for the 35 autopsy cases from Study A07, including 10 readers (5 in A16 and 5 in PT01) for all 
59 autopsy cases from Study A16. Results show that readings of single individual readers can deviate 
from the majority read and this finding emphasizes the importance of appropriate reader training.
Overall, the proposed florbetapir (18F) PET reading methodology to be used in clinical practice has not 
been shown to be the one with the highest technical performance.  A methodology to distinguish white 
matter and grey matter in PET scans and to quantify the intensity of amyloid uptake in grey matter is 
important and is achievable nowadays in clinical practice. Therefore it is strongly recommended that the 
company should continue to develop and validate a quantitative reading methodology.
For visual qualitative interpretation of florbetapir (18F) PET scans, a co-registered recent CT or MR 
imaging should be available in cases of uncertainty about the location of grey matter and of the 
grey/white matter border in the PET scan.  Moreover, it is mandatory to complete an appropriate reader
training prior to routine clinical image interpretation.   The proposed programme should be changed to be 
adapted to the European market (different indication wording than in the US, different languages, 
information about study A16 and not A07), and improved as discussed above.
It is clearly indicated that Amyvid PET examinations have to be prescribed by physicians skilled in the 
clinical management of neurodegenerative disorders.
The clinical usefulness was investigated in Study A11 with a focus on conversion from MCI at baseline to 
AD or CN in relation to the PET scan result (positive or negative). Study A11 is an extension of study A05 
and subjects in A11 were previously enrolled in Study A05 were amyloid imaging was related to clinical 
diagnosis and more or less matched autopsy literature data. The available data after 18 and 36 months 
however, do not support that in the clinical setting amyloid detection alone allows prognostic accuracy in 
patients with cognitive impairment being evaluated for suspected AD. No correlation with other potential 
biomarkers (CSF β42amyloid, tau, hippocampal volume) was provided. 
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 62/78
Overall, florbetapir-PET imaging, with its high sensitivity and specifity in the autopsy population, has the 
potential of being a valuable additional diagnostic tool in the clinical evaluation of patients with cognitive 
impairment who are being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive decline. 
The indication has been reworded to clearly indicate that a positive scan alone is not synonymous with 
the diagnosis of AD or other cognitive diseases and emphasizes that a negative scan is considered 
inconsistent with a diagnosis of AD.  Moreover, the low diagnostic performance of florbetapir (18F) PET in 
subjects with MCI at baseline, and particularly their conversion rate at 36-month follow-up when the PET 
was positive, are a reason of concern and consequently provided in the SmPC.
The limitations of use of florbetapir (18F) are described in section 4.4 of the SmPC.
The actual impact of florbetapir (18F) PET scan on diagnostic thinking and patient management has not 
been assessed, and the company is highly encouraged to further investigate these aspects.
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:
1. The company should continue to develop and validate a quantitative PET reading methodology 
based on their product.
2. The company is encouraged to perform a study to assess the impact on diagnostic thinking and 
patient management since the therapeutic consequences of the diagnosis of labelling brain β-amyloid 
are not obvious. For the design, parallel HTA/scientific advice is recommended.
2.6.  Clinical safety
Patient exposure
In the database at submission, the integrated safety database for florbetapir (18F) contained safety data 
from 496 subjects who received one dose or, in the case of 25 individuals, two doses in one study of 
florbetapir (18F). At day 150, the company also included the safety data from 3 company’s sponsored 
studies which were ongoing at submission but had already been completed. These 3 studies involved 59 
new patients who were intravenously injected florbetapir (18F) – 370 MBq-. One of those 3 studies, study 
A11, did not involve additional patients receiving the radiopharmaceuticals but 86 cases in which a 
second dose of florbetapir (18F) was administered 18-24 months after the first one.  
Overall, the sample exposed to a single administration of florbetapir (18F) in the safety database was 
286 subjects with cognitive impairment and 269 cognitively normal controls. Additionally, 110 out of 
them received two doses (24 patients within 4-weeks in study A04, and 86 cases delayed at 18-24 
months after the first injection in study A11).  All them received 370 MBq except 9 cases who received 
110 MBq.
The company also updated the profile of severe AEs with the data of the 6 still ongoing company’s 
sponsored trials (amounted a total of 1,124 exposed subjects) and with data from other ongoing trials 
with florbetapir (18F) sponsored by other companies or investigator-sponsored (with 1,455 subjects) as 
to date 15 April 2012.
Adverse events 
In the database at submission, the overall rate of adverse events (AEs) was low, with 47 of 496 (9.5%) 
subjects experiencing a total of 63 Treatment Emergent AEs nearly all of which were assessed as mild or 
moderate in severity (62 of 63 AEs), and the majority was assessed by the clinical investigators as not

related (43 of 62 AEs) to study drug. No subject was discontinued from a study because of an AE. The 
most frequently reported TEAEs (>0.5%; in descending order of frequency) were headache, 
musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and nausea. AEs are summarized in the tables below.

Only 5 additional related AEs were identified in the updated database: 2 reports of headache and 1 report 
of injection site pain, one report of dizziness, and one case of insomnia.  This makes the profile of related 
AE to change from 15 cases (3.0%) in the original database to 20 cases (3.6%) in the updated database. 
The percentages are almost similar for cognitively impaired and cognitively normal subjects. The most 
commonly reported related AE are headache (n=6 (1.1%)) and nausea (n=2 (0.4%)).
The causality of adverse events which were considered to be related to the study drug by the investigator 
was evaluated, taking into consideration the biological plausibility, frequency, severity and the PET 
procedure itself. The rationale for exclusion of adverse events as not related to florbetapir (18F) 
Amyvid

Page 66/78
administration was elucidated by the applicant: exclusion of adverse events due to reasons such as lack 
of temporal relationship, lack of biological plausibility or the presence of clear confounding factors was 
considered acceptable. The following adverse reactions are proposed to be added in SmPC section 4.8:


Common: headache
Uncommon: nausea, dysgeusia.
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
A total of 7 SAEs, including 3 deaths have been reported worldwide across florbetapir (18F) studies 
involving a total of 2,578 subjects exposed. None of these events was considered to be related to 
florbetapir (18F) by the investigators, and none of the deaths was inconsistent or unusual for the 
population and individuals in which the event occurred. The currently ascertained profile of serious drug 
related related AEs is 0%.
Laboratory findings
Clinical laboratory investigations, vital signs and ECG were evaluated as a function of subject age, 
cognitive status, gender, race, comorbid cardiac rhythm disturbance (by baseline ECG), and presence of 
AD medications or medications that might prolong QTc.
There were no clinically meaningful pre-dose to post-dose changes in the mean values associated with 
any laboratory value when considering the entire safety population or when evaluating changes by 
cognitive status. There were no changes in vital signs thought to be due to drug administration. However, 
statistically significant increases in blood pressure were seen between screening and baseline 
measurements (i.e., prior to administration of drug) as well between baseline and both t = 0 and t = 75 
minutes post dose after the completion of the PET scanning session. Changes in blood pressure were not 
related to the mass dose of compound administered and no other notable changes in vital signs were 
observed in the integrated analysis. In the 344 subjects with pre- and post-treatment ECG 
measurements, the only statistically significant finding was a small (3 msec) mean increase in QTcF at 
the 75 minutes post-dose time point shortly after completion of imaging. This change may be a 
consequence of the algorithm used to correct for heart rate decrease rather than a true physiological 
change, as the algorithm tends to under-correct when heart rate is low and produce spurious high QTc 
values. This is supported by the observation that the mean QTcB did not change significantly from 
baseline at any post-dose time point. No individuals had increases in QTcF or QTcB more than 60 msec 
from baseline, and no absolute QTc values exceeded 500 msec.  Combined with the absence of hERG 
channel binding and the lack of effects on cardiovascular function in preclinical studies, these results 
suggest florbetapir (18F) has no significant effect on cardiac electrophysiology.
Overall there were no significant differences in clinical laboratory investigations, vital signs and ECG 
across any of the examined populations.
Safety in special populations
Subpopulation analyses were conducted to look for any differential safety effects related to gender, age, 
race, concomitant use of AD medications, history of cardiac rhythm disturbances, and concomitant use of 
medications that could prolong QT. No consistent changes in safety parameters were observed in any of 
these subpopulations. In particular, there seems to be no selective vulnerability in the likely target 
population of older individuals.
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 67/78
An analysis of subjects with altered renal function (i.e. elevated serum creatinine) or hepatic function 
(i.e. elevated serum liver enzymes) from Study A07 did not show any discernible differences in AEs or lab 
values versus those with normal-range renal or hepatic parameters.
Amyvid is not expected to be used in women of child-bearing potential.
Immunological events
Although the applicant states that no immunological events have been reported, the fact that chills, rash, 
and urticaria have been observed might indicate a potential for development of at least slight 
hypersensitivity reactions, although only chills were considered by the investigators to be related to the 
product. Based on the available safety data it is currently not possible to draw definite conclusions but 
hypersensitivity reactions can not be ruled out.
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
AD medications included the cholinesterase inhibiting drugs donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and 
memantine. Overall, there were no significant differences in the incidence of AEs in subjects taking 
(7.0%) and those not taking (10.2%) AD medications. There are no known drug-drug interactions. 
Patients taking or not taking AD medications tolerated florbetapir-PET similarly well. Thus, the currently 
available data do no indicate safety concerns related to drug-drug interactions.
Discontinuation due to adverse events
No discontinuation due to AEs has been reported from any of the florbetapir (18F) trials.
Dosimetry and radiation protection
The human radiation dosimetry of florbetapir (18F) has been studied in three different clinical studies, 
two conducted by the sponsor (study A01 and A02) and one investigator-sponsored study of Lin et al. 
2010. The mean human effective dose of 0.013 mSv/MBq in Study A01, 0.019 mSv/MBq in Study A02, 
and 0.019 mSv/MBq in the Lin study.
As results of weight-adjusted calculations show no significant differences over the range of 50 to 80 kg 
body mass, no dose adjustments are recommended based on patient’s weight.
The SmPC includes specifications related to radiation protection in the context of manipulation and 
elimination of the radiopharmaceutical by healthcare professionals, and radiation protection for the 
family.

The overall number of patients exposed to florbetapir (18F) in the completed clinical trials sponsored by 
the company up to September 15th, 2012 is small (n= 555), particularly considering the prevalence of AD 
in the general population. All of them received 370 MBq as a single dose except 5 patients with AD and 4 
HC who received 110 MBq.  No post-marketing data is available since no marketing authorization had 
been issued in the world until the start date of this application procedure.

Overall, the sample exposed to a single administration of florbetapir (18F) in the updated safety database 
is 286 with cognitive impairment and 269 cognitively normal controls.  Additionally, 110 out of them 
received two doses (24 patients within 4-weeks in study A04, and 86 cases delayed at 18-24 months 
after the first injection in study A11).
Florbetapir was generally well tolerated. The most common AE related with the study drug was headache 
and nausea occurring in less than 2% of subjects. Other notable AEs were, however, more likely related 
to the procedure of IV injection (<1% of subjects with injection site bleeding, bruising or pain) or to the 
PET-procedure (musculoskeletal pain in 0.8% of subjects) than the study drug itself. This view is 
supported by the observation that the rate of these AEs was highest in studies requiring prolonged 
imaging times for dosimetry measurement.
Only few serious adverse events have been reported, and none was considered related to the study drug, 
the administration, or the imaging procedure.
There were small but statistically significant changes in lab parameters and vital signs, but most 
appeared non-detrimental. No changes in safety labs or vital sign measurements suggested toxicity of 
the study drug.
There was no safety signal related to the cognition status of the subject (cognitively impaired subjects 
versus cognitively normal subjects). Even in the A07 Autopsy Cohort end-of-life population, in which 
several individuals had many severe concomitant illnesses, the study drug was well tolerated.
No consistent changes in safety parameters were observed in any subpopulation related to gender, age, 
race, concomitant use of AD medications, history of cardiac rhythm disturbances, and concomitant use of 
medications that could prolong QT.
The human radiation dosimetry of florbetapir (18F) yields an effective dose of 0.019 mSv/MBq. The results 
of weight-adjusted calculations show no significant differences over the range of 50 to 80 kg body mass. 
Therefore no dose adjustments are needed in principle based on patient’s weight.
Specifications related to radiation protection in the context of manipulation and elimination of the 
radiopharmaceutical by healthcare professionals, and radiation protection for the family, as appearing in 
the SmPC were considered appropriate and in accordance with those approved for other fluorine (18F) 
radiopharmaceuticals.
No safety for repeated injections can be concluded due to the low number of patients exposed within a 
short time period (only 24).
The specifications of use of this radiopharmaceutical in pregnancy and lactation was drafted in line with 
the EMA core SmPC for radiopharmaceuticals.
The paediatric use of florbetapir (18F) cannot be recommended, and is not expected. A full waiver to 
perform paediatric investigations was granted.
An analysis of subjects with altered renal/hepatic function from study A07 showed no discernible 
differences in AEs or lab values versus those with normal-range renal or hepatic parameters. No specific 
safety data in patients with impaired renal function or impaired hepatic function have been provided. In 
these cases, the higher irradiation in the body caused by slower hepatic and/or renal clearance of the 
radiopharmaceutical itself or their radioactive metabolites should be taken into account and is reflected in 
the SmPC in the sense that careful consideration of the activity to be administered is required.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on Clinical Safety
Amyvid has been studied in a limited number of patients (safety population of completed clinical trials 
n=555). Overall, there were no significant safety signals identified with florbetapir-PET imaging. 
In particular there were no safety signals in cognitively impaired subjects compared to cognitively normal 
subjects or as compared to the whole safety population.  In addition, the study drug was well tolerated 
even in the A07 Autopsy Cohort end-of-life population which had many severe concomitant medical 
illnesses.
Considered together with the substantial safety margins in non-clinical studies, these safety results meet 
the expectations for a single-dose diagnostic agent and in particular for low, non-pharmacodynamically 
active amounts of a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical.
The paediatric use of florbetapir (18F) is not recommended, and the use in patients with impaired renal 
function and impaired hepatic function should be recommended with caution.
The available nonclinical findings do not show any significant nonclinical safety issues that could 
adversely affect the clinical use of Amyvid in the context of the proposed indication. Non-clinical radiation 
safety studies showed a radiation exposure risk for florbetapir (18F) which is similar to that of the 
approved PET imaging agent fludeoxyglucose (18F).
No studies have been conducted with pregnant or nursing females or with subjects under the age of 18. 
In addition, patients with hepatic or renal impairment, clinically meaningful cerebrovascular disease, or 
subpopulations carrying known and relevant genetic polymorphism (other than the ApoE gene), patients 
with BMI<19 and BMI>32 were not included in clinical trials. Due to the microdose administered and the 
rapid clearance of Amyvid, safety in patients with renal impairment is not considered to represent 
important missing information. Based on the data available it is not anticipated that florbetapir binding or 
radiation exposure will differ in patients with ApoE polymorphisms, BMI<19 and BMI>32.
As Amyvid is not intended nor expected to be used in pregnant or nursing females, the safety in this 
population is not considered relevant for inclusion in the RMP as an important safety concern.
The applicant discussed risks related to incorrect diagnosis. The key risk for Amyvid leading to incorrect 
diagnosis is considered to be incorrect scan interpretation. As the SmPC states that diagnosis cannot be 
established based on Amyvid scans alone without taking into account a clinical evaluation, the risks 
related to incorrect diagnosis beside image interpretation errors are not considered to represent safety 
concerns for Amyvid.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance
Benefits
Beneficial effects
Accuracy of clinical diagnosis of AD may be as low as 70% when compared to the definitive diagnosis of 
AD (based on a pre-specified levels of age-related brain beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density at autopsy 
in the presence or not of clinical history of dementia).  This clearly shows the high need for better 
diagnostic procedures for AD.
The intended use of florbetapir (18F) is for diagnosis.  According to the Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of 
Diagnostic Agents (CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev.1) two aspects should be considered for assessment of 
efficacy of a diagnostic:
- Diagnostic Performance (e.g. sensitivity and specificity against (reference) standard of truth)
- Clinical usefulness (impact on diagnostic thinking and/or patient management)
For florbetapir (18F), the diagnostic performance was evaluated versus the histopathological diagnosis at 
autopsy of the β-amyloid neuritic plaque density.  On the other hand, clinical usefulness was assessed 
regarding the clinical diagnosis of AD. There is a wide gap between the clinical diagnosis of AD and the 
histopathological diagnosis of neuritic plaque density at autopsy.  The uncertainties introduced by this 
gap must be considered when the efficacy of florbetapir (18F) is assessed for either diagnostic 
performance or clinical usefulness.
Diagnostic performance was the primary focus of the pivotal efficacy studies A07 (n=226, 152 autopsy 
cohort; 74 young healthy controls) and its extension study A16 (N= 108 from autopsy cohort of A07), 
which investigated the relationship between uptake on the PET image and the underlying true amyloid 
levels determined by post-mortem histopathology.  Results from the co-primary analyses achieved the 
pre-specified study objectives. The sensitivity (92%, 95% CI: 78% to 98%), and specificity (100%, 95% 
CI: 80% to 100%) of the majority visual PET read score for detecting moderate-frequent or none-sparse 
β-amyloid neuritic plaque score at autopsy, clearly exceeded the target value of 80%.
Florbetapir (18F) accurately estimates moderate-frequent or non-sparse neuritic plaque density, and 
therefore contributes additional information that is not yet included in the current clinical diagnostic 
standard of AD. In the current status of lack of reliable and validated biomarkers, and the non-feasibility 
of biopsies, this kind of accurate information on amyloid burden is not available by any other approach.  
.Moreover, information on amyloid burden is made available for the physician at a time when this 
information may still be useful for patients’ management decisions (i.e. prior to autopsy).
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects
The “end–of-life” patients and data from young healthy volunteers presumably without amyloid burden in 
the submitted pivotal studies are not representative of the intended patient population. Various 
extrapolations are made to conclude from the patients in those studies to the intended use. The selection 
of an “end-of-life” population for the primary analyses in the pivotal studies implies the extrapolation of 
the efficacy results to the intended target population of patients with remaining therapeutic options, 
preferably NOT “end-of-life” patients. In the healthy subjects (demonstration of selectivity) no 
histopathological confirmation of the absence of amyloid is available, leaving the (admittedly highly 
improbable) possibility that a significant amyloid burden may have been present in a putatively healthy 
volunteer. More importantly, the absence of false positive results in young healthy volunteers cannot be

considered conclusive proof of the absence of false positive results in (elderly) patients with neurological 
diseases other than AD. There are very little data on patients with other neurological diseases.
Amyvid is not a stand-alone diagnostic tool, and needs to be used in conjunction with a clinical 
evaluation.
Due to the limited number of subjects in the pivotal trials, confidence intervals for both sensitivity and 
specificity have considerable width, but the CHMP concluded it was reassuring that the lower limits were
still at about 80%.
The impact of reader’s subjectivity on the subjective interpretation of florbetapir-PET images was obvious 
even in the controlled setting of the clinical trials, and could not be completely eliminated by training. It 
is unknown what extent of either inter-reader variability or of individual readers with a high rate of wrong 
readings must be expected in a “real world setting”, regardless of any training provided. Similarly, it is 
unclear to what extent any reached success of the readers’ training in the clinical trials may be 
representative for the effect of a training of users post-marketing.This is addressed by a post-
authorisation measure regarding the assessment of the effectiveness of readers training.
Actual impact on physician’s diagnostic thinking (diagnosis and diagnostic intervals) was not 
demonstrated except for exclusion of amyloid burden and it is unclear to what extent any change in 
diagnostic thinking will lead to changes in patient management. Further to this, it remains unclear 
whether a tangible benefit for the patients can be expected from a change in patient management.
In the future, the clinical usefulness of florbetapir (18F) may change in line with the ongoing discussions 
on the importance and exact meaning of amyloid burden for the pathophysiology and clinical course of 
AD.   Nowadays, in the absence of treatments to stop or revert AD:

the clinical benefit to the patient brought by early AD diagnosis is unclear.

In false negative cases, omitting/delaying treatment is not crucial, and florbetapir (18F) would not 
avoid other diagnostic tests (eg. MRI, CT, blood tests, etc.): these are generally performed before PET to 
exclude non-neurodegenerative dementias when suspicions of AD exists.
The Applicant is invited to seek HTA/scientific advice on the design of a study to explore the impact on 
diagnostic thinking and patient management.
Risks
Unfavourable effects
Preclinical and clinical studies did not reveal specific safety concerns. Whereas the radiation exposure 
appears acceptable, a further minimization might be considered. A dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) provided 
slightly better visual imaging quality than a lower dose of 111 MBq in dose-finding studies; however, it is 
not clear whether an intermediate activity (e.g. of about 185 MBq) might be used with the same imaging 
quality.
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects
The high specificity, and particularly the high sensitivity to estimate the neuritic plaque density are 
appreciated. Nevertheless, false positive findings with the possible consequence of a wrong diagnosis of 
AD (and its consequences) cannot be excluded. Although no immunological events have been reported, 
the observed chills, rash, and urticaria might indicate a potential for development of these events, of at 
least of slight hypersensitivity reactions. These are included in the RMP.

Benefit-risk balance
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Diagnosis of AD has severe consequences for the patients. The current diagnosis of AD based on 
standardized clinical criteria has a limited accuracy. A final “true” diagnosis can be made only after the 
patients’ death and includes autopsy histopathology. Florbetapir (18F) accurately estimates neuritic plaque 
density, only achievable at autopsy nowadays, when the patient is still alive.  This density is one of the 
key issues, but not the only one, for the definitive diagnosis of AD at autopsy. This is regarded as a 
significant improvement in the diagnostic procedures for patients with cognitive impairment suspected of 
AD.
With no relevant adverse effects, the fact remains that false positive readings of florbetapir-PET images 
may result in wrongly diagnosed AD with the medical, psychological, and sociological consequences that 
this entails.
Benefit-risk balance
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance
There is clear evidence that florbetapir-PET images reflect the presence of moderate to frequent β-
amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brain, with high sensitivity and even higher specificity, in a 
population of end-of-life patients whose cognitive status was not accurately established.  Such capability 
has been only achievable at autopsy up to now, not when the patient is still alive.  This is regarded as a 
significant improvement in the diagnostic procedures for adult patients with cognitive impairment who 
are being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive impairment.  Currently, for a significant 
percentage of patients clinically diagnosed with AD on the basis of clinical criteria, the post-mortem 
neurohistopathology findings fail to confirm this diagnosis.
Based on current estimates on specificity and sensitivity of the neuritic plaque density, the use of 
florbetapir (18F) is expected, but not confirmed, to reduce number of patients with discrepancies between 
clinical diagnosis and histopathological findings at autopsy. Such density is one of the defining 
components of the criteria for definitive diagnosis of AD at autopsy. The absence of increased amyloid is 
not compatible with a diagnosis of AD, while there might be β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brain 
in asymptomatic elderly and other neurodegenerative demented patients.
While the safety profile of florbetapir (18F) is reassuring, the risk remains of false positive readings of 
florbetapir-PET images that may result in wrongly diagnosed AD. Therefore every effort must be made to 
minimize false positive readings. This includes restricting the use of florbetapir (18F) to its approved use, 
ensuring that florbetapir-PET scans are perceived as an additional diagnostic tool to be associated with 
clinical investigation, addressing inter-reader variability (e.g. by readers’ training and continued 
monitoring of the success of the training) and possible user non-compliance.
In the submitted supportive trials in the intended population physicians frequently changed their previous 
diagnosis when the findings in the florbetapir-PET were made available. However, information came from 
a retrospective study, which could introduce bias. Therefore it is highly recommended that the company 
performs a well-designed prospective study to assess impact on diagnostic thinking and patient 
management.
The immediate consequences of an improved diagnostic procedure for AD on the clinical course of the 
disease are less straightforward: it has not been shown that a changed diagnosis results in an altered 
treatment strategy translating in a tangible clinical benefit for the patients. This is at least partly due to 
Amyvid
Assessment report
EMA/30808/2013
Page 75/78
the rather limited effect of all currently available treatments for AD. In the absence of treatments to stop 
or revert AD, it is not clear that early AD diagnosis means benefits and omitting/delaying treatment in 
false negative cases is not crucial.
The improvement in the diagnostic procedures of AD with a non-invasive method and with the good 
safety profile of florbetapir (18F) is therefore considered of benefit even without strong evidence for an 
immediate improvement in the patient’s management and patient’s outcome of the intended population.

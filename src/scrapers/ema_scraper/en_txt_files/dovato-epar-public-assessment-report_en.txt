1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant ViiV Healthcare B.V. submitted on 13 September 2018 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Dovato, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 14 September 2017. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: ”Dovato is indicated for the treatment of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents above 12 years of age 
weighing at least 40 kg, with no known or suspected resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, or 
lamivudine.” 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to applications for fixed combination products 
The application submitted is a new fixed combination medicinal product. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0074/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and a waiver in children less than 
2 years of age. At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0074/2017 was not yet completed 
as some measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant indicated the active substance dolutegravir / lamivudine contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a known active substance. The active substances dolutegravir sodium and 
lamivudine are already authorised and marketed in the European Union. 
Scientific advice 
A central CHMP advice was sought in 3Q 2015 (decision in October 2015). A main topic discussed was the 
design of the Clinical studies to support the use of the dual regimen. The company had planned to perform 
one study in previously untreated patients and one switch study in suppressed patients. They were 
advised to perform both studies in previously untreated, using DTG plus TDF/FTC as control regimen in 
one, and a widely-recommended triple therapy regimen in the other study. The company did perform 
both studies in previously untreated patients, although identical including the control regimen (DTG+ 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 6/102 
 
 
 
 
 
TDF/FTC). The latter is considered acceptable, where DTG+ TDF/FTC is indeed a widely-recommended 
triple therapy regimen by now, and there are no regimens that would be considered more effective to 
date. The issue of interest can still be evaluated, namely whether the addition of 3TC to DTG, rather than 
a triple regimen with 2 NRTIs, is sufficient from an efficacy perspective. 
One of the questions was related to the proposed bioequivalence study approach. The CHMP agreed that 
the proposed bioequivalence study is in line with the EMA guideline on “Fixed Combination Medicinal 
Products” (CPMP/EWP/240/95) and can be considered acceptable to establish the pharmacokinetic 
equivalence of the proposed DTG/3TC FDC to the concomitant administration of the single-entity tablets. 
A primary comparison based on dosing in the fasted state is appropriate. Generating additional data when 
the FDC is given with food would be useful to confirm that there is no important effect on either agent 
when they are dosed using the FDC.  
A central CHMP advice was sought in 2018 concerning quality development. Two questions were raised: 
- 
The company proposed to change the liner system of the child resistant closure of the HDPE 
bottles and the primary stability study is performed prior to this change. These stability results 
could be considered relevant to conclude a shelf-life taken into account that the product is a solid 
oral dosage form and that both liners has identical contact layer. 
- 
Primary stability results will be provided at the long-term storage condition of 30ºC/75% RH. This 
is acceptable in accordance with ICH Q1F.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Current treatment guidelines recommend the lifelong use of 3 drugs to construct a complete regimen for 
the treatment of HIV, usually a 2-drug NRTI backbone plus a third drug in a non-NRTI class (e.g., INI, PI, 
or NNRTI). The NRTIs used to date in practice concern abacavir in combination with 3TC or tenofovir 
(disoproxil (TDF) or alafenamid (TAF)) in combination with FTC. Abacavir is associated with some 
subjective side effects and the potential to increase the risk of myocardial infarctions in high risk patients 
is still debated. TDF is also associated with some subjective side effects and carries a risk for renal toxicity 
long term. The two cytidine analogues, 3TC and FTC, are considered to have a very favourable safety 
profile, both with regards to every day side effects and long-term safety. 
Triple therapy, with the intention to create a “resistance barrier of 3”, has been used since 1996/1997.  
However, some agents have a resistance barrier that is > 1. Boosted PIs have such qualities, and 
darunavir/r given in monotherapy or in combination with 3TC yielded similar results to darunavir/r + 2 
NRTIs as maintenance therapy (i.e. in switch studies in virologically suppressed patients). DTG has also 
a resistance barrier >1, and maintenance therapy with DTG+ rilpivirine (rilpivirine with a resistance 
barrier of 1) yielded the same high response rate as DTG+ 2 NRTIs in two large scale trials, the SWORD 
1 + 2 studies, pivotal for the approval of that fixed dose regimen. DTG given as maintenance 
monotherapy, however, resulted in an unacceptable high rate of virological breakthrough over 48 weeks 
(DOMONO-study).  
Should DTG+3TC in combination provide a sufficient regimen efficacy wise, without an increased risk of 
resistance development, this would reduce the cumulative drug exposure, provide a potential safety 
advantage and reduce costs. Studies in previously untreated patients, i.e. with a high viral load when 
therapy is initiated, are the most stringent way to test the efficacy of a regimen. If such studies yield 
favourable results, the regimen can be used for the treatment of HIV-infection overall, taking any prior 
documented (or suspected) resistance into account. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant seeks the following therapeutic indication for Dovato:  ”Treatment of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents above 12 years of age 
weighing at least 40 kg, with no known or suspected resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, or 
lamivudine.”

2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
HIV-1 infection results in chronic activation of the immune system and a subsequent gradual loss of CD4+ 
T cells eventually leading to a state of acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). One of the predictors for HIV-1 
disease progression is the level of HIV-1 RNA in the blood (i.e. viral load). The aim of treatment of HIV-1 
infection is therefore to suppress, and subsequently maintain, the HIV-1 viral load to levels that are at 
least below the limit of detection of most commonly used assays (50 copies/ml of blood). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Acute HIV-1 infection is often missed, as it usually presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms 
(including fever, rash, or diarrhoea), or goes without clinical symptoms. If symptoms are present, these 
generally emerge approximately 2 weeks following HIV infection. Among those presenting with 
symptoms, the number of symptoms correlates with higher pre-seroconversion peak plasma viral load. 
Diagnostic tests for HIV-1 infection include assays for HIV-1 RNA, p24 antigen, and HIV-1 and HIV-2 
antibodies. Serological tests, such as rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) or enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), 
detect the presence or absence of antibodies to HIV-1/2 and/or HIV p24 antigen. It is important that 
these tests are used in combination and in a specific order that has been validated and is based on HIV 
prevalence of the population being tested.  Diagnosis many times occurs during chronic infection. Leading 
causes of mortality among adults with advanced HIV disease globally include tuberculosis (TB), severe 
bacterial infections, cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. 
AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by more than 51% since the peak in 2004. 
2.1.5.  Management 
According to EU HIV treatment guidelines, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended in all patients 
with HIV infection, irrespective of CD4 cell counts. The main goal of ART is to suppress viral replication to 
below detectable limits (<50 c/ml), increase CD4+ cell counts, and prevent transmission. It is a life-long 
treatment, as the viral load will rebound as soon as an individual stops taking effective antiretroviral 
therapy. 
Current treatment options are generally considered to be potent, with an overall acceptable toxicity 
profile. Mutations in the viral genome can, however, occur when the virus replicates, which can make the 
virus resistant to antiretroviral drugs or classes of drugs. Therefore, there is a continued need for 
development of new antiretroviral treatment options. 
About the product 
Lamivudine (approval in1996), a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (cytosine analogue), is 
phosphorylated to its active 5’-triphosphate metabolite (3TC-TP) intracellularly. The principal mode of 
action of 3TC-TP is the inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after 
incorporation of the nucleotide analogue into viral DNA. 
Dolutegravir (approval in 2014), an integrase inhibitor, binds to the HIV integrase active site and thereby 
blocks the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration, an essential step in the HIV replication cycle. 
This fixed dose product combines the two agents and delivers exposures suitable for adults and 
adolescents.

Prior knowledge of the existing products Tivicay (dolutegravir sodium) EMEA/H/C/002753, Epivir 
(lamivudine) EMEA/H/C/000107 and Triumeq (dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine) EMEA/H/C/002754 has 
been used throughout the development of Dovato (dolutegravir / lamivudine). 
2.2.2.  Active  substances 
Dolutegravir sodium 
General information 
The chemical name of dolutegravir sodium is sodium 
(4R,12aS)-9-{[(2,4-difluorophenyl)methyl]carbamoyl}-4-methyl-6,8-dioxo-3,4,6,8,12,12a-hexahydro-
2H-pyrido[1',2':4,5]pyrazino[2,1-b][1,3]oxazin-7-olate corresponding to the molecular formula 
C20H18F2N3NaO5. It has a relative molecular mass of 441.37 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Dolutegravir sodium structure 
The chemical structure of dolutegravir sodium was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C-NMR, IR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The solid state properties of the active 
substance were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRPD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 
The active substance is a white to light yellow, non-hygroscopic powder. Dolutegravir sodium is slightly 
soluble in water, but very slightly soluble at pH 5.0 and 6.5 and practically insoluble at pH 1.2 in aqueous 
media. The solubility increases to a maximum between pH values of 8 to 10. Based on the solubility data 
along with its high permeability, it is considered to be a BCS Class 2 compound.  
Dolutegravir sodium exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres and has potential 
for stereoisomerism (one enantiomer and two diastereomers). The chirality is controlled during the 
manufacturing. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC.  
Polymorphism has been observed for dolutegravir sodium. The anhydrous solid state Form 1 is generated 
by the manufacturing process and maintained after micronisation. This is the proposed commercial solid 
state form and is confirmed by XRPD in the active substance specification. Several solid state forms of 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 10/102 
 
 
 
 
dolutegravir sodium have been identified. The anhydrous crystalline Form 1, is generated by the 
manufacturing process and is the proposed commercial solid state form. Other identified forms with 
sufficient stability to enable isolation and investigation, are a THF solvate and a hydrate. In addition, an 
unstable desolvated solvate can form upon drying of the THF solvate or hydrate but rapidly reverts to the 
hydrate under ambient conditions.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured following two different synthetic routes: B and C. A sufficiently 
detailed description of both synthetic routes is given.  
Route B was used to prepare active substance used in clinical trials, non-clinical trials, and active 
substance and finished product primary stability batches. Route C was introduced subsequently as an 
alternative route of synthesis. 
The manufacturing processes of synthetic routes B and C were developed using a Quality by Design (QbD) 
approach in line with ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, and Q11. The information provided for this application is similar 
to that provided for Tivicay. A systematic, science and risk-based approach has been applied in evaluating 
and understanding the manufacturing process for dolutegravir sodium. The manufacturing process is 
described in terms of proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and Design Spaces (DS). For each stage, the 
processing parameters expressed in molar equivalents, volumes, time and temperatures are based on the 
current scientific knowledge and understanding of the process.  
Based on these studies, design spaces have been proposed for all the manufacturing steps of the active 
substance: stage 1 to 5, milling and reprocessing. The design space has been developed at pilot scale. 
The design spaces were verified at commercial scale. The available development data, the proposed 
control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design 
space. Based on these studies, proven acceptable ranges have been defined for the following steps of the 
manufacturing process of the active substance. The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
In combination with the input specifications, the control strategy for dolutegravir sodium manufactured 
by each process has been established to ensure that the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of dolutegravir 
sodium are controlled and that final material produced will meet its specification. The CQAs for 
dolutegravir sodium are description, solid state form, identity, dolutegravir sodium content, impurities 
and genotoxic impurities, residual solvents, water content, residue in ignition, sodium content and heavy 
methal. The CQAs for route B and route C are similar except for the different process-related impurities 
and process-related mutagenic impurities. 
Reprocessing may be done in each route of synthesis for the intermediates and active substance 
whenever the intermediates or active substance fail to comply with the approved specifications. 
Reprocessing steps are identified and justified.  
The proposed manufacturing processes (route B and route C) and the correspondent starting materials 
are considered acceptable. Satisfactory details of the quantities of the starting materials, solvents and 
reagents, together with the expected yield are given.  
Adequate in-process controls (IPCs) are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
Batch release and stability data confirm the equivalence of the active substance manufactured by the two 
proposed commercial routes and the reproducibility of the respective manufacturing processes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 11/102 
 
 
 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised for each synthetic route. 
Actual and potential impurities formed during route B process to manufacture dolutegravir sodium have 
all been considered for their genotoxicity by screening through the DEREK software program. The Route 
C manufacturing process for dolutegravir sodium was assessed for potential mutagenic impurities in 
accordance with the ICH M7 guidance Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in 
Pharmaceuticals to Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk along with the outcome of (Q)SAR assessment and 
Ames results. A full discussion on each of these identified genotoxic impurities including control, source 
and fate, and spiking and purging data, is provided. 
The micronised active substance is stored in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags and sealed with ties. 
The bags are stored within metal, fibre or plastic containers. The LDPE bags comply with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 
Polyolefines and the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification   
The active substance specification include tests for description, identification (IR), assay (HPLC), sodium 
content (ICP-AES), related substances (HPLC), enantiomeric and diastereomeric purity (chiral HPLC), 
residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), solid state form (XRPD) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
Specifications are identical for the active substance manufactured from both routes with the exception of 
the process related impurities. The proposed acceptance limits comply with the requirement of ICH Q3A, 
Q3C and M7 guidelines. 
The enantiomer of dolutegravir sodium may be present. A chiral HPLC method is used to determine the 
level of the enantiomer in dolutegravir sodium. As discussed above, the anhydrous Form 1 solid state 
form of dolutegravir sodium is generated by the described manufacturing process and is maintained.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for six production scale batches active substance are provided (three for each 
synthetic route). The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
produced using route B and stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the 
market for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Equally, stability data from two commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturers synthetised using route C and stored in a container closure system representative of that 
intended for the market for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. 
For both routes, no significant changes were observed in description, identification, related substances, 
water, content, enantiomer, diastereomer, solid state form and particle size distribution, and all results 
complied with the specification.

In addition, data are presented following short-term storage of one of the three batches of dolutegravir 
sodium under a range of stress conditions like high temperature, high humidity and extreme light (. 
solution phase: 0.1N HCl:DMSO (3:2), 80C, 1 day, water:NMP (3:2), 80˚C, 2 weeks under nitrogen, air, 
and oxygen headspaces, 0.1N NaOH:DMSO (1:4), 60˚C, 5 days; solid state: 60˚C, 7 weeks, 
80˚C/75%RH, 2 weeks and D65 light (option 1), 2 x ICH)).The results demonstrate the chemical and 
physical stability of dolutegravir sodium at all storage conditions. No significant changes were observed.  
The results from this study were used to confirm the stability indicating nature of the HPLC method 
No evidence of significant levels of degradation products have been observed under long-term or 
accelerated storage of dolutegravir sodium. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Dolutegravir sodium 
is labile. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 5 year stored up to 30ºC and 
protected from light in the proposed container. 
Lamivudine 
General information 
The chemical name of lamivudine is 
(2R-cis)-4-amino-1-(2R-hydroxymethyl-[1,3]oxathiolan-5S-yl)-1H-pyrimidin-2-one corresponding to 
the molecular formula C8H11N3O3S. It has a relative molecular mass of 229.25 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Figure 2: lamivudine structure 
The chemical structure of lamivudine was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR, ultraviolet and 
infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. All results are consistent with the 
proposed chemical structure. Additionally, X-ray crystallography, confirmed the absolute 
stereochemistry. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by XRPD and DSC. 
Lamivudine exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC.  
Polymorphism has been observed. Lamivudine may exist as either of two pseudo-polymorphs (Form I or 
Form II). The synthesis of Lamivudine is controlled to produce only Form II. 
The active substance is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic solid, which is sparingly soluble in methanol 
and slightly soluble in ethanol. Lamivudine is highly soluble in water and is considered to be a BCS Class 
3 compound.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Lamivudine is synthesised in four main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications. Lamivudine is sourced from two manufacturers that use the same route of 
synthesis. The information regarding manufacturing process and control of starting materials and 
intermediates is acceptable and it is similar to the information provided for the approved product 
Triumeq. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program.  
Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. A different synthetic 
route (known as route 2) was used to manufacture lamivudine for pre-clinical and clinical studies. 
Lamivudine made by route 4 has been used in pre-clinical and clinical studies. The result was the 
commercial route of synthesis (modified route 4). Manufacture by modified route 4 is significantly more 
efficient than by route 4 and results in smaller waste streams. Nevertheless, the final two stages of route 
4 and modified route 4 are identical and have been performed at the same sites of manufacture using the 
same equipment to give active substance of equivalent quality. Lamivudine made by modified route 4 has 
been used in clinical studies. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
Lamivudine is stored in LDPE bags and sealed with ties. The bags are stored within metal, fibre or plastic 
containers. The LDPE bags comply with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 Polyolefines and the EC directive 2002/72/EC and 
EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
Lamivudine is described in European Pharmacopoeia. The specifications applied to lamivudine include 
tests for: appearance, appearance of solution, degree of colouration (UV), as well as identification (IR 
spectroscopy and chiral HPLC), lamivudine content and related substances content (HPLC), enantiomeric 
purity (chiral HPLC,) residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) as 
described in the British Pharmacopoeia, Appendix IXA, Method 1 or by a harmonised pharmacopoeial 
method as described in Ph. Eur. 2.4.14 or USP General Chapter <281>.  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
A risk assessment has been conducted to evaluate the potential for elemental impurities to be present in 
lamivudine. This risk assessment has been performed in accordance with option 2b of the ICH Q3D 
Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The active substance used in the finished product presents very little 
risk of contributing to elemental impurities. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis data for nine batches of lamivudine (six and three for each of the two suppliers), were 
provided. The results show that all batches met the quality requirements of the proposed specification. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from the each of the proposed 
manufacturers, stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term 
conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was 
performed on two batches. Results on stress conditions (solid state: 80ºC for 14 days, 80ºC/75% RH for 
14 days; solution: 0.1N HCl 60ºC for 7 days, 0.1N NaOH 60ºC for 2 hours, oxidation by 1% H2O2 ambient 
temperature for 1 hour) were also provided on one batch.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release.  The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. All tested parameters were within specifications. Degradation 
products did not increased under accelerated conditions and remained within the proposed specification. 
In the solid state, lamivudine is stable under heat, heat and humidity, and light stress conditions. 
Lamivudine content and impurity levels in the stressed samples were essentially the same as those for the 
unstressed sample. Under solution phase stress conditions, lamivudine undergoes significant 
degradation. The results from this study were used to confirm the stability indicating nature of the HPLC 
method 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 5 years stored up to 30˚C in 
the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release bilayer tablet for oral administration containing a fixed dose 
of dolutegravir sodium and lamivudine. The tablets are oval (approximately 18.5 x 9.5 mm), biconvex, 
white, debossed with “SV 137” on one face.  
The pharmaceutical development is based on prior knowledge of the existing products Tivicay 
(dolutegravir sodium), Epivir (lamivudine) and Triumeq (dolutegravir sodium/abacavir/lamivudine). It 
used a science and risk-based approach, applying elements of QbD and quality risk management in 
accordance with ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10. The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) identified fell under the 
following categories: dosage form and strength, finished product quality criteria, drug delivery and 
release considerations, container closure system and stability criteria. 
Initially a monolayer tablet was assessed using a dolutegravir component similar to the granulation used 
to manufacture Tivicay 50 mg tablets with an extra-granular lamivudine component. Due to differences in 
pharmacokinetic (PK) performance of the monolayer tablet compared to the reference dolutegravir and 
lamivudine single formulations a bilayer tablet was subsequently developed.  
The bilayer tablet consists of a dolutegravir layer (layer 2), and a lamivudine layer (layer 1). The 
development work has especially focused on the unit operation of bilayer tablet compression. 
Experimental studies have been conducted to understand the impact of process variables to ensure a 
robust process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 15/102 
 
 
 
The finished product CQAs of description, identity, assay and content uniformity, drug related impurities 
and dissolution are in line with ICH Q6A and general regulatory and pharmacopoeial expectations for oral 
solid dosage forms.  
A quality risk management approach, in line with the principles of ICH Q9, has been applied to 
development of the control strategy for the tablets. It has been used to direct experimental activities to 
gather product and process knowledge and understanding of relationships, and assure product quality 
through the defined product and process and associated control strategy. The risk management process 
was initiated following selection of the finished product formulation and manufacturing process. This 
began with an overview of the manufacturing process which, together with risk identification tools and 
prior knowledge, was used to identify risks (failure modes) and process variables that could impact 
product quality. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was then used to prioritise development 
activities to understand and subsequently mitigate or control the risks identified to acceptable levels. 
A design space has been defined for two manufacturing steps; the granulation of dolutegravir and the 
bilayer compression. A commercial scale process stretching campaign consisting of four batches was used 
to study potential critical process parameters (CPPs) in a multivariate fashion with a Design of Experiment 
(DoE) bridging across granulation of dolutegravir and bilayer tablet compression and to define the design 
spaces. A full-factorial experimental design was used to verify the design spaces. All data presented were 
generated at commercial scale. Therefore, the PARs/design spaces proposed are considered verified at 
the proposed commercial scale. 
The selected manufacturing process produces a product which meets the required finished product CQAs 
and the requirements of the QTPP for the tablets. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 
2.1.1 of this report. 
Detailed information of the dissolution method for the tablets was provided. The data obtained shows 
significantly lower variability and full release was obtained for each active component. Dissolution 
samples are analysed by HPLC with UV detection. A discussion on the development of this method and its 
discriminating power are provided. A comparison of the dissolution profiles of the tablets dosed in the 
Bioequivalence study (204994) and the primary stability batches is provided.  
The  primary  packaging  consists  of  HDPE  bottles,  closed  with  PP  child  resistant  closures  with  a 
polyethylene-faced induction heat seal liner. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consist of preparation of the layer 1 and layer 2 compression blends followed 
by compression of layer 1 and layer 2 into a bilayer tablet which is film-coated and packed into bottles. 
The process is described in sufficient detail and the in-process parameters are considered adequate. The 
manufacturing uses conventional manufacturing technologies and is considered as a standard process. 
No process validation has been performed, but a validation scheme is provided. The validation will be 
completed prior to marketing and will include a minimum of three consecutive production scale batches. 
The validation plan focuses on blending of lamivudine layer 1, bilayer tablet compression and 
film-coating. The validation strategy and the proposed plan are considered adequate and acceptable. 
The film-coated tablets are stored in bulk containers. Based on provided stability data, storage for up to 
12 months is accepted.

CPPs, in-process material CQAs, and IPC tests that measure in-process material CQAs and their target 
values or ranges, are identified. Future changes to the defined CPP or in-process material CQA target 
values or ranges will be managed under the site’s pharmaceutical quality system with regulatory action in 
conformance with post-approval regulations and guidance. 
The process parameters and associated target values or ranges for non-critical process parameters (PPs) 
included in the process description for completeness are identified by italicised text. Future changes to the 
defined target values or ranges for these parameters are not anticipated to impact product quality.  
As indicated above, design spaces have been defined for the unit operations granulation of dolutegravir 
and bilayer tablet compression of the manufacturing process. The design spaces are described as the 
multivariate combination of ranges for CPPs and associated process parameters as applicable. The design 
spaces have been developed in conjunction with control of relevant attributes of input active substance 
and excipients as applicable as part of the overall control strategy. 
PARs are described in the process description. Future changes within each PAR will be managed under the 
site’s pharmaceutical quality system without regulatory action in line with the CHMP questions and 
answers on NORs, PARs and DS (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/354895/2017). 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification of dolutegravir and lamivudine (UV, HPLC), dolutegravir and lamivudine 
content (HPLC), drug related impurities (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC) 
and microbial tests (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification parameters are relevant and the limits are sufficiently justified. The development of the 
dissolution method is properly addressed and the discriminatory power is demonstrated (see 
pharmaceutical development section). A risk assessment of potential presence of elemental impurities in 
line with ICH Q3D has been performed. 
Batch analysis data are provided for six production scale batches manufactured according to the proposed 
manufacturing process confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product and three commercial scale 
supportive batches stored for up to 12months, under long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing (container closure system intended for 
commercial supply has equivalent barrier protection to the liner used for primary stability). No significant 
changes were observed in tablet description, dolutegravir and lamivudine content, drug-related 
impurities, microbial limits and dolutegravir and lamivudine dissolution. All results complied with the 
proposed specification. 
In addition, data have been generated following short-term storage of one primary and one supportive 
stability batch of tablets under stress conditions of 50°C/AmbH for 3 months, after a freeze/thaw cycle 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019

(-20°C/30°C) (supportive batch only), at 30°C/75% RH exposed for 1 month and after exposed 
photo-stability testing in accordance with ICH Q1B (Option 2). No significant changes were observed in 
tablet description, dolutegravir and lamivudine content, drug-related impurities, and dolutegravir and 
lamivudine dissolution. All results complied with the proposed commercial specification. The results 
demonstrate the chemical and physical stability of the finished product at all storage conditions. 
Forced degradation studies for the tablets support the stability indicating nature of the HPLC methods 
used for related substances and assay for each active substance. 
Simulated patient in-use stability data at the start of shelf-life has been presented for one primary 
stability batch following storage at 30°C/75% RH for 30 days and for 30 days at 30°C/75%RH. No 
significant changes were observed in tablet description, dolutegravir and lamivudine content, 
drug-related impurities, and dolutegravir and lamivudine dissolution. All results complied with the 
proposed commercial specification. Thus, the results demonstrate the chemical and physical stability of 
the finished product following in-use storage at the conditions tested and no separate in-use shelf-life 
needs to be defined. Aged in-use stability data will be generated at the end of the proposed shelf-life on 
a different primary and supportive stability batch. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and “this medicinal product does not 
require any special storage conditions” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The finished product is a FDC immediate release, bilayer tablet for oral administration. Prior knowledge of 
the existing monocomponent products Tivicay (dolutegravir sodium) 50 mg tablets, and Epivir 
(lamivudine) 300 mg tablets, has been used throughout the design and development of this new 
formulation. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. This information is the same as provided in the 
existing monocomponent products, when relevant. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished product 
and their manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the manufacture 
of the active substance and finished product. The design spaces have been adequately verified. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No new study assessment has been conducted for DTG or 3TC as no new data has been added for the 
present procedure. Non-clinical combination studies with DTG and 3TC were not considered warranted to 
support the current application. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Dolutegravir: DTG is referred to as a second-generation integrase inhibitor, with activity against 
raltegravir resistant viruses. DTG inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and 
blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration which is essential for the viral replication 
cycle. DTG has low nM activity against wildtype HIV-1 and HIV-2 in a variety of cell lines, regardless of 
subtype. DTG is additive or synergistic when assayed in combination with other antiretroviral agents. The 
IC50 of DTG against purified HIV-1 integrase ranges between 2.7 and 12.6nM. Corresponding values 
using more biological realistic cell assays show a 5-10x difference, with IC50 ranging between 0.51 to 
0.71nM. 
Lamivudine: 3TC is a chiral pyrimidine nucleoside analogue, with the therapeutic form being the left 
enantiomer (due its parent compound having two chiral centres: 1S, 4R absolute configuration). It is 
incorporated and metabolised intracellularly to an active moiety, lamivudine 5’-triphosphate (3TC-TP), 
which interferes with the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme so that the outcome is a stop of nucleic 
acid strand extension due to lack of a 3’-OH group. It also acts as a competitive inhibitor of RT. The 
insertion of the defective base in the RT-DNA transcript is irreversible. The IC50 for viral replication ranged 
from 2nM to 15μM. The Ki for the inhibition of RT is 10-12μM. The in vitro intracellular half-life of 3TC 
monophosphate was 10-15h.  3TC had no activity against a number of other pathogens [RNA and DNA 
viruses (except hepatitis) bacteria and fungi] normally occurring during HIV disease, indicating anti-HIV 
specificity. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Dolutegravir:  In a screening of a total of 93 target molecules and isolated tissues, the only interaction 
effect was detected for melanocortin receptors (MC). MC3 and MC4 were the most high affinity targets of 
DTG with an IC50 of 5.77uM and 5.31uM respectively. The relevance of a potential binding to MC3 and 
MC4 remains unclear. MC3 and MC4 are both the predominant MC subtypes in the brain, and have – based 
on academic animal experiments - been linked to the effects of drugs of abuse. MC3 is also likely involved 
in energy metabolism while MC4 has been linked to the regulation of appetite, blood glucose, and blood 
pressure. Based on a human DTG Cmax of 3.7ug/mL and plasma protein binding data, this gives a 
systemic marginal of at least 60x. DTG does not appear to have been tested for potential inhibitory 
activities against DNA topoisomerase I and II that are involved in DNA replication, recombination and 
transcription. 
Lamivudine: Cytotoxicity was investigated using different in vitro cell systems (e.g. human erythroid 
precursors, human bone marrow progenitor cells). LC50 (concentration reducing cell viability by 50%) was 
>30μM. Depending on the test systems used, the therapeutic index (i.e. the ratio between LC50 and IC50) 
was in general large. No data are available regarding receptor screen with 3TC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 19/102 
 
 
 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Dolutegravir: Results from safety pharmacology studies based on single oral doses of DTG up to 500 (rat) 
and 1000 (monkey) mg/kg indicate a low likelihood of inducing acute effects on major organ function in 
brain, respiratory and cardiovascular system. The maximum concentration of DTG tested in the hERG 
assay was rather low (20μM) for a proper analysis (due to solubility issues) but the absence of 
cardiovascular adversity in the toxicological studies indicate this not to be an issue. While gastrointestinal 
toxicity was reported in the toxicological program, no safety pharmacology assessment of the GI system 
was conducted and a weakness in the non-clinical program. That being said, this is still considered 
acceptable in the presence of clinical safety data. 
Lamivudine: Safety pharmacology studies with lamivudine showed no major effects on cardiovascular or 
respiratory parameters or on intestinal transport. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Due to different routes of metabolism and elimination and minimal effect of DTG and 3TC on drug 
metabolizing enzymes or transporters, no clinically significant drug interactions are expected between 
DTG and 3TC. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption - Dolutegravir: DTG was rapidly absorbed in the animal models. After oral exposure, DTG 
levels peaked in mouse blood after 2h, 6h in rat and 2h in cynomolgus. Bioavailability of DTG in rat and 
monkey ranged from 25% to 34% and increased to levels of 76% to 87% after fasting. The bioavailability 
in dog was reported to 39%. The bioavailability results suggest that the absorption of free acid DTG could 
be limited by the solubility and dissolution rate. With increasing doses systemic exposure levels increased 
in the different animal models although less than dose-proportionally in rat (adult and juvenile) and dog 
and dose-proportional in cynomolgus up to 50mg/kg (but not above 50mg/kg to 500mg/kg). There were 
no clear differences in exposure extent between given intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. 
There were no signs of dose accumulation over time (up to 104w) in rodents. Intravenous absorption of 
DTG was also investigated but is not included in this overview. 
Distribution - Dolutegravir: Protein binding of DTG was 99.9% in rat, 95.4% in dog, 99.1% in monkey and 
99.3% in human. In mice, the blood to plasma ratios of radioactivity ranged from 0.49 to 0.54. The blood 
to plasma ratios of total radioactivity ranged from 0.51 to 0.53 in rat. In monkey, the blood-to-plasma 
ratio ranged from 0.64 to 0.79 through 24 hours post-dose. Overall, these data indicate that radioactivity 
was largely associated with plasma components of blood. Distribution studies after single oral doses of 
DTG in partially pigmented rats indicated highest levels of radiolabel at 2-6h postdose with the top target 
tissues being: in small intestine mucosa, lungs, the bulbo-urethral gland, liver, pigmented skin, adrenal 
medulla and renal medulla and cortex. Levels in brain were low (~2% of the blood radiocarbon 
concentration), but quantifiable. Studies in pregnant rats demonstrated that DTG crossed the placenta 
and that foetal radioactivity was highest in blood, myocardium and muscle. In addition lacteal transfer of 
DTG was evident (mainly in the form of the parent compound). Mean milk to blood concentration ratios 
were 0.45 at 1 hour post-dose, steadily increased to a maximum of 2.3 at 8 hours post-dose, and then 
decreased to 1.3 at 24 hours post-dose. 
Metabolism - Dolutegravir: The DTG metabolite profiles in the animal models (rodents, cynomolgus) 
showed an overall comparable pattern of metabolites with no unique metabolites formed in humans and 
not found in animals. However, for rabbit, used as an animal model in segment II DART studies, no 
metabolite data were included. Metabolic profiling in rodents (mouse and rat) showed that the parent 
compound (DTG) was the major radiolabelled compound in plasma, liver and faeces. In isolated perfused 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 20/102 
 
 
 
rat liver DTG was shown to be metabolised via routes involving N-dealkylation (M1), oxidation (M7), 
hexose conjugation (M2), glucuronidation (M3) and hexose or glucuronide conjugation in combination 
with N-dealkylation (M4 and M5) or with oxidation (M6 and M8). In monkey, a metabolite resulting from 
loss of fluorine and addition of cysteine and oxygen was found (16% of radiocarbon, 3.1% of dose). In 
faeces, DTG was the major component. In urine the major component was DTG glucuronide (M3) 
accounting for 68%. Minor components in urine were a hexose conjugate and an N-dealkylated 
metabolite. DTG in faeces appeared to be due to a contribution from deconjugation of biliary metabolites 
as well as from lack of absorption. In vitro studies in rat and human liver microsomes (at 100uM DTG) 
indicated that a reactive electrophilic metabolite of DTG, consistent with addition of glutathione through 
oxidative defluorination was formed. The significance of the formation of this metabolite is considered to 
be limited at doses relevant for the clinical setting. 
Elimination - Dolutegravir: Most of the DTG dose was eliminated within 24h post-dose. DTG radioactivity 
was mainly eliminated in faeces, corresponding up to 93-94.1% in the mouse, 90.7-92.6% in the rat and 
between 67% and 78% in cynomolgus. In contrast, mouse urine accounted for 2%, rat urine accounted 
for <4% and cynomolgus urine for 4.4-6%. Based on bile duct cannulated animal studies, biliary 
excretion accounted for approximately 2.5% of the dose in mouse, 7% of the dose in rat and 12% of the 
dose in cynomolgus. The majority of dose was eliminated within 24 hours post-dose. No sex differences 
were found. It can be noted that DTG was found to be a major component in milk from lactating rat (82.9 
to 97% over 24 hours).  
Absorption - Lamivudine: 3TC is rapidly cleared from rat and dog after a single i.v. administration with a 
terminal half-life between 1.5 and 1.7h. At very high 3TC doses in rat (up to 2000mg/kg), the data 
suggests that 3TC was distributed extra-vascular (the clearance was 4 mL/min and the volume of 
distribution was 540 mL). The rat renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 3.3mL/min (at the 
highest dose of 2000mg/kg, the clearance was reduced to 2.0mL/min). This value is higher than the 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR), indicating that tubular secretion plays a significant role in the clearance 
of 3TC. For dog, the clearance was approximately 5.5-5.7 L/h and renal clearance accounted for about 
1.5-2.3 L/h. The renal clearance value in dog for 3TC was lower than the GFR, indicating that tubular 
secretion does not play a significant role in the elimination in dog. No sex differences were observed. The 
kinetics of 3TC (45 or 2000 mg/kg) after single oral administration were investigated in juvenile rats on 
postnatal day 16. The mean AUC and Cmax values obtained indicate that systemic exposure to 3TC of a 
juvenile rat is at least twice that of an adult rat receiving an equivalent dose.  
After oral administration, 3TC was rapidly absorbed in rats and dogs with a bioavailability of 60% to 69% 
(rat) and 67% to 83% (dog). In rats dosed orally with 3TC, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) 
ranged from 41μg/mL at the lowest dose level (600mg/kg) to 107μg/mL at the highest dose level 
(2000mg/kg) at 1 to 2h after dosing. The plasma half-life increased from 3.7h at 600mg/kg to 4.6h at 
1500 and 2000mg/kg. Both Cmax and AUC in the dose range 600 to 2000mg/kg were dose proportional. 
Following single oral administration of 3TC to rabbits (45 mg/kg), Cmax was 13.7μg/mL within 1h. In dog, 
peak plasma concentrations (13.6-26.6μg/mL) were observed at approximately 40 minutes after dosing. 
Both Cmax and AUC increased less than dose proportional in dog.  
The limiting factor of bioavailability in dogs was metabolism while in the rat it was absorption from the 
gastrointestinal tract. In rat, 3TC was mostly absorbed (50 to 85%) within 2h from the small intestine 
(duodenum, jejunum, and ileum). Only 4-5% was absorbed in the stomach. The systemic exposure after 
a single oral administration was dose-proportional in rat but less than dose-proportional in dog.  
Distribution - Lamivudine: The plasma protein binding profile of 3TC was concentration-dependent with 
saturation at higher concentrations in both rat (49% at 0.1ug/mL to 16% at 1ug/mL) and dog (42% at 
0.1ug/mL to 12% at 1ug/mL). It can be noted that the concentration-dependent binding was also true for 
human plasma proteins although with more rapid saturation (with 36% binding at 0.1ug/mL and <10% 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 21/102 
 
 
 
at >1ug/mL). The top 3TC organ/tissue distribution targets in rat were: kidney (with the highest levels in 
the renal papilla, followed by the medulla and then the cortex) and the bladder. The tissue distribution 
occurred with 15 min and peaked around 1h after administration. Pregnant rat studies showed that 3TC 
crosses the placenta but that the levels in maternal blood and placentae were markedly higher than those 
in the foetuses. There was no particular localisation bias in any foetal organ or tissue. On GD19, at 24h 
post-dose, radiolabelled 3TC had been eliminated from both maternal and foetal tissues. Studies in 
lactating rats at PND14 demonstrated a 3TC transfer into the maternal milk with the milk/plasma ratio 
peaking after 8h at 16-fold. 
Metabolism - Lamivudine: The main 3TC metabolite in mouse, rat and dog was a metabolite that was a 
trans-sulphoxide product with cytosine. The metabolite was a minor metabolite in rodents but a major 
metabolite in dogs. In rodents, there was relatively little biotransformation of 3TC. Most of the 3TC was 
excreted in unchanged form (>90%) via the urine. The remainder of the urinary radioactivity was 
accounted for by the trans-sulphoxide (GI138870X) and the cis-sulphoxide in approximately equal 
proportion. The metabolic profile of 3TC in pregnant rats was the same as that seen in non-pregnant rats. 
In contrast, in dog, only around 30% was unchanged in the urine. The trans-sulphoxide metabolite was 
also present at 5% to 10% of the dose in humans. Chiral analysis was performed to determine if chiral 
inversion of 3TC occurs in vivo. No chiral inversion of 3TC was observed. 
Elimination - Lamivudine: In mouse, after oral exposure, urinary excretion accounted for approximately 
54% of the administered 3TC radioactivity, the majority within the first 24 hours after dosing. Faecal 
excretion accounted for approximately 29% of the orally administered dose. In rats, 57-59% of the oral 
dose was excreted via the urine and 24.5% was eliminated via faeces during the first 24h. Studies in 
pregnant and non-pregnant female rats (and rabbits) indicate pregnancy has no effect on the excretion 
pattern for the elimination of 3TC material. In male dogs, about 97% of the 3TC oral dose radioactivity 
was recovered in urine (with two metabolites accounting for 52%). On the basis of urinary recovery of 
unchanged 3TC, the oral bioavailability was 80% which is in close agreement with the value of 83% 
derived from AUC data. In female dogs around 78% of the dose was excreted in the urine. Faecal 
elimination accounted for approximately 1% of the oral dose. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The assessments for DTG and 3TC derive from previous procedures (Tivicay for DTG, Epivir for 3TC), in 
the case of Tivicay, the juvenile toxicity study assessment derived from an extension procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/2753/X/018/G). An overview of the toxicological data is provided below. Animal model 
selection: For DTG, the main animal models selected were rats (Sprague Dawley) and monkeys 
(Cynomolgus). In the DTG toxicological program, dog was found to be an inappropriate species due to 
DTG intolerance vomiting observed after a single dose at ≥150mg/kg. For 3TC, the main animal models 
were rat (Allen and Hanburys Albino rat or AHA) and dog (Beagle dog). In the DART studies, the DTG 
studies used Japanese white rabbit as the second non-rodent EFD study animal model whereas the 3TC 
program used Dutch rabbit. The basis of the selection was the similarities in their pharmacokinetic and 
metabolic profiles to humans and extensive historical background data available for these species. 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose studies were performed with DTG but it can be noted that DTG was not tolerated at doses 
≥300 mg/kg/day in the 14d monkey toxicity study (resulting in severe gastrointestinal intolerance leading 
to morbidity and mortality). A single dose toxicokinetics study in dogs was conducted at doses up to 
500mg/kg. DTG was not tolerated and resulted in vomiting at doses ≥150 mg/kg.  
For 3TC, single dose toxicity was studied in rats and mice with no signs of acute toxicity for doses up to 
2000 mg/kg i.v. (both species) or 2x2000 mg/kg orally (mice only).

Repeat dose toxicity 
General toxicity - Dolutegravir: The general toxicity of DTG after oral administration was mainly studied 
in rats (up to 26w) and cynomolgus monkey (up to 38w). One 13w mouse study (as a precursor to a 
two-year mouse carcinogenicity study) was also conducted.  
Mortality and moribundity: Mortality was mainly observed in the cynomolgus studies (14d) at doses of 
1000mg/kg. There were signs of hepatotoxicity (liver hypertrophy and liver single cell necrosis), 
gastrointestinal toxicity (atrophy and haemorrhage of mucosal epithelium in the stomach) and renal 
toxicity (renal tubule dilatation) in the moribund animals. It can be noted that there was some mortality 
among rat juvenile animals at 75mg/kg in the juvenile toxicity study. 
Overall effects: The principal treatment-related effects of DTG in rats and monkeys were related to 
gastrointestinal toxicity. Gastric mucosal haemorrhage was seen in both rats (at 500mg/kg) and 
cynomolgus (50/30mg/kg). Cynomolgus also demonstrated multifocal erosions in the stomach and 
mucosal atrophy and/or haemorrhage in the cecum, colon, and rectum (at 50/30mg/kg). 
Rodent studies: In a only mouse study (13w oral gavage), DTG at 500 mg/kg generated slight increases 
in bilirubin and liver transaminases levels and the mucous neck cells in stomach appeared increased. 
Systemic exposure at a dose of 500 mg/kg corresponded to ~15x the expected clinical exposure. Gastric 
mucosal changes and lesions were found in all rat studies (from 2w to 26w) with findings including 
eosinophilic infiltration, thickening of the limiting ridge mucosa, oedema, acanthosis as well as incidences 
of microscopic haemorrhage in the glandular stomach at doses of 500 mg/kg and higher. These effects 
were reversible during a 1 month recovery period. The NOAEL in the 26w rat toxicity study was 50 
mg/kg/day (Cmax = 47ug/mL, AUC0-24 = 765 ug x h/mL), giving a margin of roughly 14-15x to the 
expected clinical exposure. 
Cynomolgus studies: Besides the gastrointestinal toxicity noted above (i.e. gastric mucosal 
haemorrhage, stomach multifocal erosions and cecum/colon/rectum mucosal atrophy), cynomolgus 
demonstrated hepatic effects. In non-moribund animals, liver function change indicating effects (ALT 
increase) was seen from 300mg/kg and histological (hepatocellular single cell necrosis and vacuolation) 
was seen from 1000mg/kg. In the moribund animals in the 14d study, there were increases in bilirubin 
and liver transaminases and decreases in red blood cells and reticulocytes and lymphocytes from 
50mg/kg. Renal effects (renal tubule dilatation plus increased BUN and CRE levels) were seen from 
50mg/kg. Bone marrow and lymphoid changes (thymic atrophy, splenic lymphoid atrophy, decreased 
lymphocytes of the submandibular and mesesenteric lymph nodes, adrenal hypertrophy/increased 
weight) were seen at 100mg/kg. The most sensitive cynomolgus NOAEL was set at 15mg/kg with a 
gender mean Cmax of 5.1ug/mL and AUC0-24 of 39ug x h/mL. This gives a (AUC-based) margin of ~0.7X 
to the expected human exposure for a 50 mg QD. 
General toxicity - Lamivudine: The general toxicity of 3TC after oral administration was mainly studied in 
rats (up to 26w) and dogs (up to 52w).  
Mortality and moribundity: In a 13w exposure of dogs, one female receiving a dose of 3000 mg/kg/day 
died during week 5 and, over the following 2 weeks, 2 further animals from this group were killed for 
humane reasons. Besides being exposure linked, the proximate causes of mortality/morbidity remain 
unclear. No deaths among dogs were seen after 52w exposure with a max dose of 2000mg/kg.  
Overall effects: The main target organs of toxicity in both rats and dogs (with more pronounced effects in 
dogs) were within the haematopoietic system (toxicity manifest as anaemia, decreased platelet count, 
leukopenia and splenic hemosiderosis). There was incomplete recovery following the exposure periods. 
Minor haematopoietic system effects (red blood cell changes) were observed at the low dose in the 52w 
dog study. After extended exposure periods (13w and 26w for rats, 13w and 52w for dogs) animals 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 23/102 
 
 
 
demonstrated indications of impaired liver function (increased ALT and AST levels but without major 
histological effects except some minor lipid deposition in dogs) and gastrointestinal effects.  
Rat studies: Changes in the caecum were observed in high 3TC dosed rats (2000mg/kg BID) after one 
month and after six months. In the 26w study, a chronic low-grade irritation of the cecum/anus was seen. 
The overall most sensitive NOAEL was 300mg/kg/day BID in rats (in the ~1 and 3-month studies), giving 
a Cmax of 30.9ug/mL (end of study) and AUC0-t of 145ug x h/mL (end of study). The animal to human 
AUC margin (at 300mg QD) was 23-24x. The AUC margin was slightly lower for the 26w rat study NOAEL 
of 425mg/kg BID (21-22x).  
Dog studies: There were histopathological findings of slight centrilobular lipid deposition in the liver and 
moderate thymic atrophy in high dose animals (3000 mg/kg/day) in the 13w study, and minimal 
hemosiderosis in the spleen in the high dose group of the 52w study. It can be noted that in the 52w dog 
study, there were also unexplained treatment related increases in plasma folate and Vitamin B12. The 
MAH has speculated that as 3TC is a cytidine analogue and both folate and Vitamin B12 are involved in 
nucleotide metabolism it may be due to a biochemical response overlap. These effects showed incomplete 
recovery. The overall most sensitive NOAEL was 45mg/kg BID (52w study) corresponding to a Cmax of 
22.9ug/mL (end of study) and AUC0-t of 343ug x h/mL (end of study). The animal to human AUC margin 
(at 300mg QD) was ~12x. Based on the presence of haematological/clinical chemistry changes in low 
dose males in the 52w study, the NOEL was <45 mg/kg/day BID. 
Genotoxicity 
Dolutegravir: For DTG, two pivotal in-vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames test, and two mouse lymphoma 
assays) and one pivotal in-vivo genotoxicity test (oral gavage rat micronucleus test) were conducted. Two 
long term carcinogenicity studies (one main rat study and one less powered mouse study) were 
conducted. 
Genotoxicity studies: The in-vitro tests used DTG up to cytotoxic concentrations. Negative results were 
reported except for a weakly positive result in the mouse lymphoma assay at high cytotoxicity. A previous 
non-GLP mouse lymphoma test was positive at high dose but cytotoxicity may have confounded results.  
The in vivo rat micronucleus test was negative. Taken together the data did not indicate any relevant 
genotoxic potential of DTG. 
Lamivudine: For 3TC, six pivotal in-vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames test, mouse lymphoma TK assays, 
mouse cell transformation assay, human peripheral lymphocyte test) and six pivotal in-vivo genotoxicity 
tests (oral gavage and i.v. rat micronucleus tests, oral rat bone marrow metaphase analysis, rat liver UDS 
assays) were conducted. Two 3TC two-year carcinogenicity studies mouse and rat) were conducted.  
Genotoxicity studies: 3TC was not mutagenic in the Ames test at concentrations up to 5000µg/plate. In 
the mouse lymphoma assay, small increases in mutant frequency were observed with concentrations 
from 1000µg/mL. In human peripheral lymphocytes, 3TC showed clastogenicity at the highest 
concentrations of 300µg/mL without S9 and 2292.5µg/mL in the presence of S9. The concentration of 
300µg/ml is 150 times higher than the mean steady-state Cmax at the 300 mg once daily clinical dose so 
this is not considered to be an issue. There was no indication of genotoxicity in the cell transformation 
assay or in the in-vivo genotoxicity tests. The plasma levels in the bone marrow metaphase analysis 
assay were around 30 to 40 times higher than clinical levels. Cytotoxicity: In a study on 3TC effects on 
cells and mitochondria (a human leukaemia cell line and HepG2), there were no 3TC specific effects on 
cellular/mitochondrial content or lactate production, cell growth, glucose consumption and LDH leakage.

Carcinogenicity 
Dolutegravir: Long term (two year) carcinogenicity studies for DTG were conducted in mouse and rat. The 
mouse study is more relevant as it had 45 animals per sex and dose group whereas the rat study had only 
a maximum of 12 animals per sex and dose group. The rat study dose range was 7.5, 25 and 500mg/kg. 
The mouse study dose range was 2, 10 and 50mg/kg. Overall DTG did not exhibit any significant 
neoplastic activity in either study. There were some apparent increases in tumours of the kidney, liver and 
urinary bladder in mouse when compared with vehicle control, but not when considering water control. 
Similarly, in rat there were some increases such as hyperplasia of the non-glandular stomach, 
hepatocellular adenoma in high dose animals, but there was no dose-response and incidences were within 
historical values and likely the relevance of these findings is limited.  In rat, 3 oligodendrogliomas, a rare 
neoplastic finding, were reported at mid dose. Exposure at the high dose was only 2.1 to 1.6-fold higher 
than at mid dose. However, in an overall view, and considering the lack of any clinically relevant 
carcinogenicity of DTG, these data are not considered to provide a likely indication of human 
carcinogenicity. 
Lamivudine: Two long term dietary 3TC exposure studies were conducted in mouse and rat (exposure 
between 180 and 2000mg/kg). These were preceded by palatability and 13-week preliminary studies for 
the oral (dietary) route. The mouse study included groups of 60 males and 60 females. A dose-related 
reduction in mouse body weight gain was seen at all dose levels. In the rat study, there were 55 animals 
per sex and group in the main study. A reduction in body weight gain was seen was 8 to 18% lower than 
controls in groups at the high dose. The systemic exposure of animals was 10-58x than the systemic 
exposure of humans at clinical use. Overall, there was no clear indication of 3TC linked carcinogenesis in 
mouse or rat. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
DART – Dolutegravir: Based on a segment I study, male and female rat fertility did not appear to be 
affected at doses up to 1000 mg/kg (NOAEL 1000mg/kg). In the segment II EFD studies, 1000mg/kg 
gave a slight increase in pre-implantation loss in rat but the relevance of these effects was uncertain and 
there were no malformations or increase in variations at the high dose (NOAEL 1000mg/kg). In rabbits, 
doses of 1000 mg/kg were associated with maternal toxicity in the form of decreased food consumption 
and body weight, but no clear embryotoxic effects were observed (maternal NOAEL 200mg/kg, 
embryo-foetal NOAEL 1000mg/kg). The rat EFD toxicokinetic profile for DTG ranges from AUC0-24h 
949-1252ugxh/mL (100mg/kg low dose) to AUC0-24h 1841-2032ugxh/mL (1000mg/kg high dose and 
maternal and embryo NOAEL). The rabbit EFD toxicokinetic profile for DTG ranges from AUC0-24h 
2.1-2.6ugxh/mL (40mg/kg low dose) and 14.5-15.6ugxh/mL (200mg/kg middle dose and maternal 
NOAEL) to 30.1-36.8ugxh/mL (1000mg/kg high dose and embryonic NOAEL). The animal to human 
systemic exposure margin for rat were 37.9x and for rabbit 0.27-0.56x (AUC ratio based on human 
AUC0-24h value from 50mg QD). In the perinatal and postnatal development study (exposure duration: 
GD6 to PND20), statistically significant decreases were noted in the body weights of female offspring (F1) 
in the 1000 mg/kg group between PND11 and PND42 as compared to the control group. The NOAEL was 
set at 50mg/kg. 
Juvenile toxicity study: Postnatal/juvenile rats were orally exposed to DTG between PND4 to PND66 (0.5, 
2 or 75mg/kg). Offspring of both sexes where overall more sensitive to exposure during pre-weaning (age 
specific manifestation of growth reduction and death) but male offspring recovered their weight loss 
during post-weaning (PND21 to PND66) while female offspring did not. This indication of postnatal rat 
female specific sensitivity is in line with the results from the peri- and postnatal study (exposure duration 
GD6 to PND20) where only female offspring where found to have a statistically significant growth 
reduction. The juvenile rat NOAEL was set at 2mg/kg (Cmax 7.5-16.4ug/mL, AUC 85.7-316ug x h/mL, 
min and max across male and female animals) and the LOAEL at 75mg/kg. Overall, the study indicates 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 25/102 
 
 
 
that postnatal to juvenile rats have a decreasing systemic exposure with age and that postnatal/juvenile 
animals are much more sensitive to adverse effects of DTG compared to adult animals. The estimated 
animal to human exposure ratio gives a NOAEL margin of 4.6x to 8.4x for PND13 and 1.3x to 2.4x for 
PND32. 
DART – Lamivudine: Based on a male and female fertility study in rat, oral exposure to 3TC did not impair 
reproductive performance in rats (NOAEL 2000mg/kg BID). There was no evidence of teratogenic 
potential in rats (GD7 to GD17, at doses up to 2000 mg/kg BID). Two pivotal rabbit EFD studies 
(GD8-GD20 exposure) were conducted. In the first study, with a dose ranging from 45mg/kg BID to 
500mg/kg BID, there was some maternal toxicity and pre-implantation loss at all doses. One 
intermediate dose animal died. One low dose, one intermediate dose and 3 high dose animals aborted. In 
a second pivotal EFD study with a dose range between 7.5 and 45mg/kg BID, some high dose mothers 
demonstrated a reduction in the amount of faeces but no other signs of maternal toxicity. 
Pre-implantation loss was slightly, but not significantly, increased in the 20 and 45 mg/kg BID group 
animals, but not at 7.5mg/kg BID. Small, non-significant, increases in post-implantation loss were also 
seen in these groups with consequent reductions in the number of implantations and foetuses. Foetal 
body weight was slightly increased in the intermediate and high dosage groups compared with the control 
group but there were no external or visceral major foetal abnormalities. The rabbit NOEL was set to 
7.5mg/kg BID. No AUC values were generated for the rat EFD study at the NOAEL, giving a rat NOAEL 
(2000mg/kg BID) Cmax of 66.9ug/mL. For rabbit, the exact NOEL and NOAEL are unclear due to trends 
(statistically non-significant) of effects that were manifest in the first pivotal study. This gives a NOEL 
(7.5mg/kg BID) Cmax of 0.45ug/mL and a AUC of 2.3ug x h/mL (corresponding to an animal to human 
AUC margin of 0.37x). At the middle (20mg/kg BID), the Cmax was 1.05ug/mL and an AUC of 5.9ug x 
h/mL (corresponding to an animal to human AUC margin of 1.0x). At 45mg/kg BID, the Cmax was 
2.55ug/mL and the AUC was 14.8ug x h/mL (corresponding to an animal to human AUC margin of 2.4x). 
There was no dedicated segment III study conducted for 3TC but rather two combined studies (one 
segment I+II+III study and one segment III and juvenile toxicity study). In the combined segment 
I+II+III study, F1 offspring demonstrated lower 'rearing' movements in activity tests and higher prostate 
weight at the high dose, giving a F1 NOAEL of 450mg/kg BID. See below for the outcome for the combined 
segment III and juvenile toxicity study.  
Juvenile toxicity study: In the combined oral gavage segment III and juvenile toxicity study in at 
(maternal max dose 2000mg/kg BID from GD17 to PND21 and offspring max dose 2000mg/kg QD 
between PND3 and up to PND43), several effects were seen in dams and offspring at the max dose. A 
reduction of offspring testis weights with histological changes corresponding to slight to moderate 
dilatation of the seminiferous tubules was observed in high dosed males (2000 mg/kg/day). As testicular 
findings were not observed in adult animals, this indicates that the effect is based on increased juvenile 
animal sensitivity (e.g. related to testicular immaturity/developing status). Incisor eruption was slightly 
but statistically significantly delayed in males and females at 2000mg/kg QD. Mild microcytic anaemia 
was also observed (similar to outcomes in adult animals in the repeat dose studies) in the offspring. As 
with the extended segment I+II+III study, this gives a juvenile NOAEL of 450mg/kg (QD) (possibly 
confounded by the maternal exposure to 4500mg/kg BID until PND21) which corresponds to a Cmax of 
167-176ug/mL (no AUC provided). The animal to human exposure margins (human dose of 300 mg QD) 
was >80x. 
Phototoxicity and cytotoxicity aspects 
Phototoxicity - Dolutegravir: DTG absorbs light in the wavelength of 290-700 nm (minor peaks at 309, 
321 and 335 nm) and the rat distribution study showed that drug-related material reaches the uveal tract 
as well as the skin. In the Neutral Red Uptake assay using Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, DTG was phototoxic 
when tested up to the limit of solubility in primary vehicle (7.93 mg/mL, the maximum dose formulated 
in DMSO). In a dedicated 3d rat (Long Evans) phototoxicity study (dose range 10 to 1000mg/kg over 5d), 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 26/102 
 
 
 
there were no indications of phototoxicity. No drug-related toxicity has been identified in the eye or skin 
during repeat dose oral toxicity studies of up to 6 months in the Sprague Dawley rat or 38 weeks in the 
cynomolgus monkey.  
Phototoxicity -Lamivudine: 3TC does not absorb light in the 290 to 700 nm wavelength range. 
Phototoxicity studies have therefore not been performed for 3TC. 
Local tolerance and antigenicity 
Antigenicity and immunotoxicity – Dolutegravir: No specific antigenicity tests have been conducted for 
DTG. Oral administration of DTG at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day for 1 month had no effect on keyhole 
limpet hemocyanin (KLH) antibody titers in rats, indicating that DTG has no immunosuppressive effects 
on a TDAR. The animal to human exposure margin is likely around ~33x based on extrapolation from the 
systemic exposure achieved in the 4w rat toxicity study. Immunotoxicity endpoints (TDAR, 
immunophenotyping and TCRVβ usage) were included to the DTG rat juvenile toxicity study. No 
immunotoxicity effects were observed, giving a juvenile immunotoxicological NOAEL of 75mg/kg (the 
max dose). It can be noted that in a 2w monkey study spleen atrophy of white pulp was reported at a dose 
of 1000mg/kg. Overall based on non-clinical data the potential for immunotoxicity would appear a minor 
concern. 
Antigenicity and immunotoxicity – Lamivudine: An active systemic anaphylaxis reaction study 
(sensitization and challenge phases) was conducted for 3TC in Guinea pig (up to 10mg/kg s.c. for 3doses 
per week for 3w in the sensitization phase; up to 10mg/kg i.v. single dose for the challenge phase). No 
anaphylactic reactions were observed in any of the groups treated with 3TC or with a lamivudine protein 
mixture (3TC-HSA). In a homologous PCA reaction 3TC Guinea pig study (dosage up to 10mg/kg), 3TC 
did not generate any positive homologous PCA reaction (either as 3TC or 3TC-HSA as challenge antigens).  
Local tolerance – Dolutegravir: Local tolerance studies conducted in vitro and in vivo showed that DTG 
had mild irritant effects on abraded skin and slight ocular irritating effects that were reduced with rinsing 
after exposure. DTG was non-sensitizing in the mouse local lymph node assay. 
Local tolerance – Lamivudine: 3TC local tolerance studies did not reveal any skin/eye irritancy nor skin 
sensitizing or antigenic potential. 
Impurities  
Dolutegravir related impurities: While there were several DTG product-related impurities in previous 
procedures (addressed by Ames test), no impurities in the proposed Drug Substance Specification 
exceeds the 0.15% w/w ICH qualification threshold. In the previous procedure (Tivicay), three impurities 
(intermediates in the synthesis) were found to test positive in the genotoxicity tests. These impurities 
were/are controlled by specification or control of the manufacturing process.  
Concerning impurities, for dolutegravir and lamivudine, there are no specified impurities in the proposed 
Drug Substance Specification that exceed the 0.15% w/w ICH qualification threshold. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Environmental risk assessment – Dolutegravir: DTG (CAS #1051375-19-9) was initially accepted on the 
European market as the medical product Tivicay in 2014. An ERA for DTG was assessed and accepted 
during the Tivicay and Triumeq MAA procedures. No additional assessment of the empirical studies has 
been conducted in this procedure as no additional data has been submitted. The predicted environmental 
concentration for surface water (PECSW) was calculated to 0.50ug/L (PECSW > 0.01ug/L) based on an 
Fpen of 0.01 (1%). Based on the shake flask method (OECD TG107, GLP), the log D of DTG is -2.45, 
thereby not triggering a PBT assessment. In Phase II, different refinements gave a PECSW range between

0.0047 and 0.0126µg/L. For groundwater, the PECGW ranged between 0.00118 and 0.0126ug/L. A 
refined sediment PEC (PECSED) gave a value of 27.15ug/kg. Based on sludge adsorption properties (Kdoc 
=10609-15367), DTG is likely to give rise to some terrestrial exposure.  The soil PEC after one year and 
10 years were 0.249ug/kg and 2.49ug/kg respectively. The DTG shows a DT50 > 1y in water sediment 
systems and in soil and can be considered very persistent (vP) in the environment. Algae were the most 
sensitive aquatic species with a NOEC of 0.0954mg/L followed by fish (larval survival) at a NOEC of 
0.22mg/L. Pea what the most sensitive plant species with NOEC of 12mg/kg.  
Environmental risk assessment – Lamivudine: 3TC (CAS #134678-17-4) was initially approved in 1996 
(Trade name: Epivir) before the implementation of the EU ERA regulations for human medical products 
(in 2006). A subsequent application for a 3TC containing medical product (i.e. Triumeq containing a FDC 
of DTG, abacavir and 3TC; accepted in 2014) provided ERA data (although incomplete in the main 
application and generating a PAM commitment). A full 3TC ERA was subsequently generated via Variation 
IB procedure EMEA/H/C/002754/IB/0043. Using the same prevalence Fpen setup as in the DTG 
calculation (Fpen = 0.01 > 0.007 in Estonia) gave a 3TC phase I PECSW of 1.5ug/L (PECSW > 0.01ug/L). 
Based on the shake flask method (OECD TG107, GLP), the log D of 3TC is -1.44, not triggering a PBT 
assessment. In Phase II, different refinements gave a PECSW range between 0.046µg/L and 0.049µg/L. 
For groundwater, the refined PECGW ranged between 0.00115 and 0.0123ug/L. A refined sediment PEC 
gave a value between 0.21ug/kg and 0.22ug/kg. 3TC is not readily biodegradable in sludge and 
hydrolytically very stable. It is not persistent in water-sediment systems and was found to be degraded to 
the chiral isomers, five major (>10% AR) and two minor (<5% AR) unidentified degradation products. 
There are no indications that 3TC usage leads to terrestrial exposure via sludge. Fish were the most 
sensitive aquatic species with a NOEC of 10mg/L followed by algae at a NOEC of 96.9mg/L. 3TC is not a 
PBT candidate and all risk quotients (RQ) are below. See table.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
DTG was not mutagenic or clastogenic and there were no indications of carcinogenicity in long term 
studies in the mouse and rat. The primary effect of DTG was gastrointestinal intolerance or irritation in 
rats and monkeys at doses that produce systemic exposures approximately 21 and 0.82 times the 50 mg 
twice daily human clinical exposure based on AUC, respectively. There were indications of a potential for 
DTG to disturb liver functional activity in the 3 months study in rats. In monkeys, liver effects were 
reported at doses from 300 mg/kg in the 2-week study with more pronounced reactions, including single 
cell necrosis and hypertrophy at a dose of 1000 mg/kg. The mechanism of liver injury in monkey is not 
known. There are no indications that DTG is a developmental toxicant in rat or rabbit. No malformations 
or other embryo-foetal adversity were detected at the max doses (1000mg/kg). The mechanism of liver 
injury in monkey is not known. There are no indications that DTG is a developmental toxicant in rat or 
rabbit. No malformations or other embryo-foetal adversity were detected at the max doses (1000mg/kg). 
DTG was found to be a maternal toxicant in rabbit at the highest dose. While there were no signs of 
teratogenicity, it can be noted that there was a clear rat to human AUC based exposure margin for rat 
(~23-38x from the lowest to the highest dose) whereas there was no margin for rabbit (0.05-0.56x). DTG 
has shown some signs for phototoxicity. In a review of clinical data presented by the Applicant in the 
Tivicay procedure, no phototoxicity reactions were identified; however, with the caveat that the data 
obtained in clinical trials are limited and it is unclear to what extent patients have been exposed to sun. 
Overall, the non-clinical studies have provided sufficient characterisation of the principal aspects of 
toxicity of DTG. 3TC was not mutagenic but there were some signs of clastogenicity at the highest 
concentration tested in human lymphocytes. This is unlikely to be relevant as there were no 
carcinogenicity signs in two long term dietary 3TC exposure studies (mouse and rat). In the DART studies, 
rabbit was found to be more sensitive than rat (maternal toxicity and pre-implantation losses). There 
were signs that juvenile rats were more sensitive to 3TC with regard to testicular toxicity. 
With regard to the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of DTG, it can be noted that the highest HIV 
prevalence in any EU region based on WHO/ECDC and UNAIDS data from 2017 and 2018 is 0.7% 
(Estonia) whereas earlier calculation (for Tivicay) was based on Estonia prevalence of 1.2% from 2011 
which gave a PECSW of 0.60ug/L.  
The ecotoxicological data indicates that DTG is a more potent aquatic toxicant than 3TC and that DTG 
usage will also lead to terrestrial exposure via sludge usage. 3TC is not biodegradable in sludge and will 
likely be persistent in surface waters (DT50 > 40d) as long as the compound does not become trapped in 
sediment where it is not persistent. When taking predicted environmental concentrations into account, 
there are no indications that DTG or 3TC are environmental risks (all risk quotients (RQ) were below 0.1). 
While DTG can be considered very persistent, none of the active substance can be considered potential 
PBT or vPvB substances.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In the absence of new non-clinical studies (single or interaction) the non-clinical program for Dovato can 
be considered acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
A request for routine GCP inspection was adopted for the following clinical study: GEMINI 1. The 
inspections were performed at three sites: Argentina, Mexico and Taiwan. The inspections revealed major 
findings mainly related to site management, e.g record keeping issues, discrepancies on source data 
verification for adverse events.  However, these issues were not deemed to be critical, and the inspection 
team concluded that although there are deficiencies and departures from GCP observed in the trial, the 
trial has been conducted according to the ethical principles for clinical trial in humans and the data 
collected at the investigational sites inspected are considered of acceptable quality.

higher than with reference.  The 
higher Cmax is not considered 
clinically relevant; PK of the 
bilayer FDC provide an 
acceptable bridge to the 
co-administration of Tivicay and 
Epivir tablets used in the Phase 
III trials. The bilayer FDC was 
selected for further clinical 
development. 
The bilayer FDC tablet given with 
a high-fat meal resulted in higher 
plasma DTG AUC(0-), AUC(0-t), 
and Cmax and lower plasma 3TC 
Cmax. The magnitude of the food 
effect on DTG and 3TC was 
similar to that observed in prior 
studies and is not considered 
clinically significant. These 
results support the 
recommendation that the bilayer 
FDC tablet can be given without 
regard to meals. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of the active substances dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) has already 
been evaluated during the initial MAAs for the respective single-entity. 
DTG and 3TC are also co-formulated in another fixed dose combination together with abacavir (Triumeq, 
dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine, 50 mg/600 mg/300 mg, film-coated tablet, date of issue of marketing 
authorisation valid throughout the European Union: 31/08/2014). 
Absorption 
Bioavailability 
Dolutegravir: DTG is rapidly absorbed, with a tmax of 2-3 h after oral dosing of the tablet formulation. The 
absolute bioavailability of DTG has not been determined. 
Lamivudine: Lamivudine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the bioavailability of oral 
lamivudine in adults is normally between 80 and 85%. Following oral administration, tmax occurs at about 
1 h.

FDC: For Dovato, the median time to maximal plasma concentration (tmax) is 2.5 hours for dolutegravir 
and 1.0 hour for lamivudine, when dosed under fasted conditions. 
Study 204993 investigated two experimental mono-layer formulations of the fixed-dose combination 
compared to the mono-components. 
Bioequivalence 
The bilayer formulation is the planned commercial formulation applied for in this application.  
The bioequivalence study and its statistical evaluation were in accordance with accepted standards for 
bioequivalence testing, as stated in the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 1/Corr). 
Under fasting conditions the conventional bioequivalence criteria compared to the separate entities were 
met with respect to lamivudine AUC(0-t) and dolutegravir Cmax, but not for dolutegravir AUC(0-t) and 
lamivudine Cmax. 
Dolutegravir AUC(0-t) was 16% higher after administration of the FDC compared to the reference 
mono-components and the upper limit of the 90% CI of 125.07 was slightly above the BE acceptance limit 
of 125.00. 
Two subjects had a non-measureable concentration of dolutegravir at 72h time point and tlast=48 h. An 
ad-hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted by the applicant, by excluding these subjects from analysis 
(see Table 3 with results for only 72 subjects). Exclusion of these subjects cannot be accepted since this 
is a post-hoc analysis. The relevant result for AUC(0-t) is the result with 74 subjects included. Thus, formal 
bioequivalence was not demonstrated for this parameter, although the results were just outside the 
acceptance criteria. The result for AUCinf was just within the conventional acceptance criteria.  
The clinical relevance of the 16% higher dolutegravir AUC(0-t) is discussed in the section Clinical safety, 
“Historical safety data of treatment with higher doses”. From a pharmacokinetic perspective it is noted 
that the increase in exposure following intake with food seems to be lower for the FDC than for Tivicay 
(see subheading Effect of food); thus the dolutegravir exposure following intake with food is probably not 
higher for the FDC than for Tivicay. The conclusion in the section Clinical safety is that the 16% increase 
in dolutegravir AUC(0-t) is not considered clinically relevant.   
Lamivudine Cmax was 32% higher after administration of the FDC compared to the reference 
mono-components and the upper limit of the 90% CI of 1.3760 was above the BE limit of 1.25. The 
applicant has submitted data from 3TC historical studies in order to support the higher Cmax for the bilayer 
FDC compared to the reference formulation. The clinical relevance of the 32% higher lamivudine Cmax is 
discussed in the section Clinical safety, “Historical safety data of treatment with higher doses”, where also 
a cross-study comparison of lamivudine Cmax data is shown. The conclusion is that this increase is not 
considered clinically relevant.

Table 3 - Assessment of Bioequivalence: Statistical Comparison Plasma DTG and 3TC PK 
Parameters Derived Based on Actual Sampling Times 
Effect of food 
Administration of the FDC tablet (planned commercial formulation) with a high-fat meal increased DTG 
AUC and Cmax by approx. 32% and 21%, respectively, while for 3TC there was a decrease in Cmax with 
approximately 32% and AUC was not affected compared to administration under fasted conditions. The 
tmax was prolonged with approx. 2.5 h with food for DTG and approx. 1.5 h for 3TC. For DTG a higher food 
effect has previously been reported (approx. 70% increase in AUC with a high fat meal). DTG can 
generally be taken with or without food according to the Tivicay SmPC (except in case of certain integrase 
class resistance, where there is a recommendation to take the product with food), i.e. this discrepancy is 
considered to be of minor importance. Dovato is not indicated in patients with patients with known or 
suspected resistance to integrase inhititors. Also Triumeq can be taken regardless of food according to 
SmPC. Previous data have shown that food does not affect AUC for 3TC, which is in accordance with the 
present data. In addition, earlier data has shown that Cmax was decreased for 3TC which is in line with the 
food interaction study using the FDC Triumeq. In the pivotal Phase III studies with 
dolutegravir/lamivudine the products were given with or without food. In conclusion, the SmPC 
recommendation that Dovato can be taken with or without food is acceptable. 
Distribution 
Dolutegravir: Plasma protein binding of DTG was approximately 99.3% and independent of concentration 
over the therapeutic range based on in vitro data. In the hepatic impairment study the unbound fraction 
(fu) of DTG increased with decreasing serum albumin concentration, while there was no evident trend in 
the relation between fu and 1-acid glycoprotein. The blood-plasma ratio was in the range 0.44 to 0.54. 
Based on the population PK analysis, the apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) in patients was 
determined to be 17 to 20 L. DTG is distributed to CSF and the resulting steady state concentration is 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 40/102 
 
 
 
 
similar to the unbound concentration in plasma. In healthy volunteers (human ADME study, oral 20 mg, 
suspension) Vd/F (CV%) was determined to 12.5 L (9%).   
Lamivudine: From intravenous studies the mean volume of distribution is 1.3 L/kg. Lamivudine exhibits 
linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and binding to serum albumin in vitro is 
<16-36%. The mean ratio of CSF/serum lamivudine concentrations 2-4 hours after oral administration 
was approximately 12%. 
Elimination 
Excretion 
Dolutegravir: Based on the population PK analysis, CL/F and half-life in patients was determined to be 
approximately 1 L/h and 12 h, respectively. Based on phase I meta-analysis in healthy volunteers the 
corresponding data was 1.14 L/h and 14.4 h, respectively. 
In the human mass balance study the total mean recovery of the administered radioactive dose was 96%, 
with relative recovery of 64% in faeces (94% of radioactivity assigned) and 32% in urine (87% assigned). 
Unchanged DTG constitutes the major part of the radioactivity excreted in faeces (53% of the dose). 
Virtually no DTG (<1% of dose) was excreted unchanged in the urine. It is likely that the major part of the 
DTG recovered in faeces originates from biliary excreted glucuronide conjugate, which has been 
converted back to parent in the gut lumen. 
Lamivudine: Lamivudine was predominately cleared by renal excretion as unchanged compound. The 
mean systemic clearance was approximately 0.32 L/h/kg, with renal clearance (~70%) via the organic 
cationic transport system.  The observed lamivudine elimination half-life was 5-7 h. 
Metabolism 
Dolutegravir: DTG is metabolised by UGT1A1 and also to some extent by CYP3A4 (~10% of dose in mass 
balance study). The fraction in urine was represented by ether glucuronide of dolutegravir (18.9% of total 
dose), N-dealkylation metabolite (3.6% of total dose), and a metabolite formed by oxidation at the 
benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose). Dolutegravir is the predominant circulating compound in plasma. 
Lamivudine: Metabolism is a minor route of elimination of lamivudine. The extent of hepatic metabolism 
is low (5-10%). The active moiety, intracellular lamivudine-TP, has a terminal half-life in the cell (16 to 19 
hours) compared to the plasma lamivudine half-life (5 to 7 h) after 300 mg once daily. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following repeat-dose administration, plasma concentrations of DTG reached steady state by 
approximately 5 days of dosing. DTG AUC and Cτ increased proportionally between 10 and 50 mg once 
daily. The increase in DTG Cmax was slightly less than dose-proportional. Accumulation was observed in 
AUC, Cmax, and Cτ following repeat-dose administration of DTG once daily, with accumulation ratios 
estimated to be 1.24 to 1.42, 1.16 to 1.36, and 1.29 to 1.53, respectively, across 10 to 50 mg once daily 
dose levels. DTG showed time-invariant PK. 
Following oral dosing using the tablet formulation, DTG was rapidly absorbed with maximal concentration 
observed at 1.5 to 2 hours post dose. Following repeat-dose administration, plasma concentrations of 
DTG reached steady state by 7 days of dosing, and accumulation ratios ranged from 1.25 to 1.42 across 
doses. The increase in DTG exposure (AUC and Cmax) was less than dose proportional following both 
single- and repeat-dose administration. DTG showed time-invariant PK and moderate %CVb ranging from 
16 to 51%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 41/102 
 
 
 
Lamivudine demonstrates linear, time-invariant PK with Cmax and AUC values that increase in proportion 
to the dose (see module 2.7.2). 3TC displayed dose proportional single-dose and repeat-dose PK 
following oral dosing of 0.5 to 20 mg/kg/day. 3TC is primarily eliminated as unchanged drug in urine; CLr 
exceeded GFR, suggesting that 3TC CLr involves tubular secretion. At steady state, on average, >70% of 
an administered dose was accounted for as parent compound in urine, generally within the first 24 h. 
Special populations 
No clinically relevant effect on the PK of race, gender and weight was observed for any of the two active 
components. There is limited data in elderly patients for both active components. In children above 12 
years of age, the exposure was comparable to those observed in adults for both compounds. In a 
meta-analysis using pharmacogenetic samples from healthy volunteers (n=89), the influence of UGT1A1 
polymorphism on the DTG exposure was investigated. The AUCτ of DTG in subjects with the low function 
(*28/*28, *28/*37) and reduced function (e.g. *1/*28, *28/*36) of the UGT1A1 enzyme, increased by 
46% and 17%, respectively. This is considered not to be clinical relevant.  
Impaired renal function 
Dolutegravir: Exposure to DTG was 40% lower in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance 16 to 28 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to healthy controls. The mechanism for the decrease is 
unknown.  
Lamivudine: Studies with lamivudine show that plasma concentrations (AUC) are increased in patients 
with renal dysfunction due to decreased clearance. Dose reduction is required for patients with creatinine 
clearance of <50 ml/min. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Dolutegravir: The unbound clearance of DTG was reduced by 35% to 50% in subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment (HI) leading to an approximate 1.5 to 2-fold increase in unbound exposure to DTG. No 
dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild to moderate HI. The effect of severe 
hepatic impairment on PK of DTG has not been studied. 
Lamivudine: The PK profile of 3TC is not significantly affected in patients with moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Children 
Dolutegravir: Body size, age: These are statistically significant covariates of DTG CL/F, Vd/F, and/or F, 
but the effects are not considered clinically significant; no DTG dose adjustment according to these 
covariates is needed.  
Adolescents: plasma DTG exposure values for 50 mg QD dosing in adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age 
weighing ≥40 kg were similar to those observed in adult patients on approved 50 mg QD. 
Lamivudine: -Children and Adolescents: Significant differences in CL and CL/F have been described 
between paediatric and adult patients. When the relationship of Clo and age for the combined data from 
studies NUCA2002 and NUCA2005 (Day 1 data only) was adjusted for body size (weight), as age 
increases, Clo approaches adult oral Clo (approximately 0.5 L/h/kg) values. This occurs at adolescence 
(approximately 12 years). Due to the larger CL values in paediatric patients compared with adults 
relatively larger doses are required to achieve similar exposure. The comparative 3TC exposure following 
doses of 4 mg/kg/day in adults compared with 8 mg/kg/day in paediatric patients up to 12 years old, 
support the recommendation to transition paediatric patients to adult dosing recommendations when the 
Assessment report

total daily dose reaches the dose recommended for adults (i.e., 300 mg once daily). This occurs at 
approximately 40 kg body weight (typically at adolescence >12 years old). 
Elderly  
Dolutegravir 
The PK of DTG in elderly patients (>65 years old) is not fully characterized. Table 4 shows the number of 
subjects above 65 years of age where PK data was collected. 
Table 4 - DTG studies where PK data was collected in elderly patients 
Lamivudine 
PK data of 3TC in elderly patients (>65) is limited. Table 5 shows the number of subjects above 65 years 
of age where PK data was collected. 
Table 5 - 3TC studies where PK data was collected in elderly patients 
Interactions 
No interaction study has been performed with the FDC tablet and no specific DDI study to investigate 
potential interaction between the two compounds has been performed. Interaction studies have been

performed with the individual components dolutegravir and lamivudine and any interaction identified for 
these individually are also relevant to Dovato. The combination is established in clinical practice. The 
absence of a specific interaction study between dolutegravir and lamivudine is acceptable.  
For the monoproduct Tivicay, there is a recommendation to take the product well separated from 
administration of cations (magnesium/aluminium-containing antacids, calcium supplements and iron 
supplements), since concomitant intake results in reduced DTG exposure. However, it was demonstrated 
that administration with calcium and iron in the fed state resulted in similar exposure as for dolutegravir 
in the fasted state without supplements. The staggered dosing approach was generally recommended for 
Tivicay since no data was available comparing DTG in the fed state (as recommended in case of class 
resistance) to DTG in combination with calcium or iron in the fed state. Dovato is however not indicated 
in case of integrase class resistance, and can be taken regardless of food intake, and thus it is acceptable 
to include a recommendation that the product can be taken at the same time as calcium- or iron 
containing supplements and multivitamins if taken with food. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of Lamivudine (3TC, Epivir approved for twice daily dosing in 1996, and for once 
daily dosing in 2001) and DTG (Tivicay approved in January 2014) are well established and therefore only 
briefly discussed in this report. Of note, DOVATO is indicated in patients infected with HIV-1 with no 
known or suspected resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, or 3TC. 
Lamivudine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (cytocine analogue), is phosphorylated to its 
active 5’-triphosphate metabolite (3TC-TP) intracellularly. The principal mode of action of 3TC-TP is the 
inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the 
nucleotide analogue into viral DNA. Resistance to 3TC is linked to a specific amino acid substitution in the 
HIV-1 reverse transcriptase at codon 184, changing the methionine to either isoleucine or valine 
(M184V/I). 
Dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor, binds to the HIV integrase active site and thereby blocks the strand 
transfer step of retroviral DNA integration, an essential step in the HIV replication cycle. In selection 
experiments in vitro, resistance development to DTG in wild type virus is slow, and resulting mutant 
viruses carried substitutions resulting for the most in a moderate decrease in DTG susceptibility, referred 
to as fold change (FC):  S153F or S (FC 4), G118R (FC 10) and R263K (FC 2). These mutations are 
associated with a substantial impact on viral fitness. E92Q (FC 3) and G193E (FC 3) have also been 
selected in vitro but are considered secondary without an impact on efficacy alone. Secondary mutations 
that add up in selection experiments do not substantially reverse the reduction in viral fitness. The 
mentioned qualities are the background for the high resistance barrier of DTG that has been verified in a 
large number of clinical trials. In previously untreated patients who were given DTG in combination with 
2 NRTIs there have been no cases of de novo resistance to DTG or the integrase inhibitor class, to date.  
Some resistance mutations (in combination) that may be selected during failing therapy with first 
generation integrase inhibitors (raltegravir and elvitegravir) are associated with a decrease in DTG 
susceptibility and a reduction in efficacy; mutations of the Q148 pathway in combination with secondary 
mutations (typically G140S or E138K). 
Mechanism of action 
Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) of HIV-1 and HIV-2, which is 
metabolised sequentially by intracellular kinases to the respective 5'-triphosphates (TP). Lamivudine-TP 
(an analogue for cytidine) is a substrate for and competitive inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). 
However, its main antiviral activity is through incorporation of the monophosphate form into the viral DNA 
Assessment report

Page 44/102 
 
 
 
chain, resulting in chain termination. Lamivudine triphosphate shows less affinity for host cell DNA 
polymerases and this may explain 3TC’s lack of propensity for causing mitochondrial toxicity as well as its 
broad therapeutic index. 
Dolutegravir is an HIV Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), by binding to the integrase active site 
and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV 
replication cycle. 
Primary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics was studied in the non-clinical component of the development of the single 
entities (3TC/DTG) programme. 
Nonclinical studies  
A range of in vitro virology studies have been conducted to determine the mechanism of action, antiviral 
activity and the potential for development of drug resistance. DTG inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the 
integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration which is essential 
for the HIV replication cycle. DTG has low nM activity against wildtype HIV-1 and HIV-2 in a variety of cell 
lines, regardless of subtype. DTG is additive or synergistic when assayed in combination with other 
antiretroviral agents. Comparative susceptibilities to DTG and RAL were obtained from 60 RAL-resistant 
site directed HIV-1 mutants and 6 site directed HIV-2 mutants.  DTG retained activity against a vast 
majority of these mutants.  Additionally, susceptibilities to DTG and RAL were determined for over 700 
RAL-resistant clinical isolates, with DTG retaining activity (<10 FC) against >90% of them. 
Intracellularly, 3TC is phosphorylated to its active 5’-triphosphate metabolite, 3TC triphosphate 
(3TC-TP). The principal mode of action of 3TC-TP is the inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via 
DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue into viral DNA 3TC-TP is a weak 
inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases ,  and . 3TC has low M activity against wildtype HIV-1 in a 
variety of cell lines, regardless of subtype. 3TC is additive or synergistic when assayed in combination 
with other antiretroviral agents. 3TC resistant variants have been isolated in cell culture.  
Clinical studies  
Studies EPV10001 and NUCB4001 evaluated plasma 3TC and intracellular 3TC-TP PK between 300 mg 
once daily and 150 mg BID dosing (EPV10001) and between 150 mg BID and 300 mg BID dosing 
(NUCB4001). In EPV10001, a higher plasma 3TC Cmax for 300 mg QD vs. 150 mg BID was observed, 
while the steady-state intracellular 3TCTP Cmax did not increase. In NUCB4001, serum 3TC AUC and 
Cmax increased with dose, whereas the intracellular Cmax and AUC(0-12) of the 3TC mono-, di- and 
triphosphate moieties remained similar between the high and low dose. 
Together, these studies indicate that saturation of the intracellular 3TC phosphorylation and a plateauing 
of intracellular 3TC-TP occur at exposures between a 300 mg to 600 mg daily dose. This is supported by 
the combined analysis of 4 pivotal registrational studies which showed a comparable safety profile in 
treatment groups that received a 3TC 600 mg daily dose (300 mg BID) to groups that received a 3TC 300 
mg daily dose (150 mg BID). Therefore, any increase in plasma Cmax associated with the bilayer FDC is 
unlikely to translate to an increased safety risk due to plateauing of intracellular 3TC-TP. Plasma AUC is a 
surrogate measure of intracellular 3TC-TP concentration and is considered to be the best plasma PK 
predictor of NRTI efficacy [Wang, 2004, Weller 2000, Fletcher, 2000]. The 3TC AUC for the bilayer FDC 
was bioequivalent to the 3TC 300 mg used in the GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies, indicating that the 
extent of absorption is the same for the bilayer FDC and the SE 3TC 300 mg tablet and that no impact on 
clinical efficacy is expected.

Virology data from the pivotal GEMINI studies 204861 and 205543, supported the non-inferior antiviral 
activity of the DTG + 3TC combined regimen compared to dolutegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine in 
HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve adults at Week 48. 
In pilot clinical studies (204861 and 205543), primary PD parameter (viral load), was measured and 
virologic success was established for an initial threshold of HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL and later, antiviral 
activity of the dual regimen of DTG + 3TC was further demonstrated in a more strict analysis (sensitivity 
analysis) of the proportion of subjects with virologic success, using a viral load threshold of HIV-1 RNA 
<40 c/mL (Table 6). 
Table 6 - Summary of Study Outcomes (Plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) at Week 48 – Snapshot 
Analysis in Studies 204861, 205543 and Pooled Data (ITT-E Population) 
In GEMINI 1 (204861), virology data from the Week 48 analyses demonstrated that protocol-defined 
Confirmed Virologic Withdrawal (CVW) was low, with 4 subjects in the DTG + 3TC group and 2 subjects in 
the DTG + TDF/FTC group meeting CVW criteria at any time through Week 48. No subject meeting CVW 
in either group had treatment emergent INSTI or NRTI resistance associated mutations through Week 48. 
Regarding Confirmed Virologic Withdrawal Frequency, a total of 4 subjects in the DTG + 3TC group met 
CVW criteria by Week 48; 1 subject at Week 16, 2 subjects at Week 24, and 1 subject at Week 48. Two 
subjects in the DTG + TDF/FTC group met CVW criteria by Week 48; 1 subject at Week 24 and the other 
at Week 48 All subjects meeting CVW criteria were classified as virologic rebound ( 
Table 7).

In GEMINI 2 (205543), virology data from the Week 48 analyses demonstrated that protocol-defined 
CVW was low, with 2 subjects in each treatment group meeting CVW criteria at any time through Week 
48. No subject meeting CVW in either group had treatment emergent INSTI or NRTI resistance associated 
mutations through Week 48. 
Regarding Confirmed Virologic Withdrawal Frequency, a total of 2 subjects in each treatment group met 
CVW criteria by Week 48; all were at Week 24. All subjects meeting CVW criteria were classified as 
virologic rebound.(Table 8)

Prior studies have shown that DTG and 3TC PK exposures in adolescents are sufficiently similar to those 
in adults and allows extrapolation of GEMINI efficacy data to adolescents.

Secondary pharmacology 
Nonclinical studies  
The evaluation of the possible off-target clinical effects is discussed based on the results from the 
nonclinical studies. 
Dolutegravir 
DTG (up to 10 M) was tested in vitro against a variety of proteins which included 16 enzyme assays and 
65 physiological receptors and ion channels binding sites [Report RH2007/00072].  DTG at 10 M did not 
significantly affect (defined as 50%) 80 of the 81 in vitro assays.  The only effect greater than 50% was 
a 64% inhibition in the melanocortin (MC4) receptor binding assay. Inhibition at 10 M was >100-fold 
above the free clinical Cmax for DTG when administered 50 mg QD [Cmax = 3.7 g/mL (~8.8 M) and 
because DTG is ~99% protein bound the free unbound concentration was 0.037 g/mL (0.088 M).  In an 
additional study conducted to assess the potential for dolutegravir to bind the melanocortin receptors 
MC1, MC3, MC4 and MC5, similar results were observed with IC50 values ranging from 5.31 to 56.1 M 
with all exposure margins >60X [Report 2014N204265]. 
No findings associated with MC4R agonism or antagonism have been observed in toxicity or clinical 
studies with DTG.  No significant effects on body weight in healthy or HIV-infected subjects administered 
DTG have been observed to date.  Taken together, these data indicate a lack of apparent biological 
activity at the melanocortin receptors. 
Lamivudine 
Specific nonclinical secondary pharmacology studies have not been performed with 3TC. No off-target 
pharmacological activity has been reported during the extensive clinical use of 3TC. 
Clinical studies  
The effect of dolutegravir on cardiac conduction was assessed in Study ING111856 by 12-lead ECG 
compared with placebo and moxifloxacin (thorough QTc study of DTG). Randomized, partial-blind, 
single-dose, 3-period, crossover study, Healthy adult subjects (42 Enrolled/38 Completed), DTG 250 mg; 
oral suspension; single dose / Placebo; oral suspension; single dose / Moxifloxacin 400 mg; tablet; oral; 
single dose. DTG had no effect on cardiac repolarization at a supratherapeutic dose of 250 mg suspension. 
The study was sensitive enough to detect the effect of moxifloxacin, the positive control, on QTcF, which 
confirmed that this study was valid for assessing the effects of DTG on cardiac repolarization. 
The effect of DTG on renal function was assessed in Study ING114819 as the effect on GFR as measured 
by iohexol and to evaluate creatinine clearance, extraglomerular creatinine excretion, and renal plasma 
flow, Open-label, randomized, 3-arm, parallel, placebo controlled study, Healthy adult subjects (38 
Enrolled/34 Completed), DTG 50 mg; tablet; oral; once daily; 14 days DTG 50 mg; tablet; oral; q12h; 14 
days Placebo; tablet; oral; once daily; 14 days Omnipaque 300 (647mg/mL of iohexol) 5 mL; solution; IV 
Aminohippurate sodium 2 g/10 mL (20%) of Loading dose: 8 mg/kg, Maintenance dose: 12 mg/min; 
solution; IV.  
The main conclusion confirms that the administration of DTG caused a 10 to 14% reduction in plasma 
CrCl, which is consistent with previous clinical studies. DTG was shown to increase serum creatinine due 
to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without significantly affecting GFR or ERPF. DTG inhibits the 
renal transporter OCT2, a mechanism that is consistent with a benign increase in serum creatinine.

The cytotoxic effect of dolutegravir was evaluated in parallel with the antiviral assays. Overall the 
cytotoxicities measured in these assays were distinct from the antiviral potencies and provided selectivity 
ratios from >350-fold to 6800-fold indicating that the observed antiviral activity of DTG was not due to 
cytotoxicity. 
Cytotoxicity assays were conducted in proliferating human leukemic and lymphomic cell lines and PHA 
stimulated and unstimulated human PBMCs from the same donors, with resulting cell cytotoxicity (CC) 
IC50s for DTG in proliferating IM-9, U-937, MT-4 and Molt-4 cells of 4.8, 7.0, 14 and 15 μM, respectively 
and in unstimulated and stimulated PBMCs of 189 μM and 52 μM, respectively, (see Table 9). 
Table 9 - Cytotoxicity Assay Results in PBMCs and B and T Cells 
When compared to the antiviral activity of DTG IC50 of 0.51 nM in PBMCs the selectivity index for antiviral 
activity was >9400. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology and pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics properties of DTG and 3TC have been evaluated throughout their respective 
development programs. Data to support clinical pharmacology are from Epivir documents for 3TC 
component, and from Tivicay development program. 
The non-inferior antiviral efficacy of the 3TC/DTG FDC on HIV-1 has been demonstrated throughout the 
clinical pivotal trials, conducted as a 2-drug regimen of DTG + 3TC once daily compared with a 
"standard-of-care" first-line 3-drug regimen of DTG + 2 NRTIs (TDF/FTC FDC) once daily in 
HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve adults. Both groups had few subjects meeting Confirmed Virologic 
Withdrawal (CVW) criteria. In these CVW subjects, treatment with either regimen was not associated with 
development of treatment-emergent resistance to INSTIs (or NRTIs) after 48 weeks of therapy. The FDC 
regimen offers potential favourable tolerability and its high barrier to resistance and ability to confer a 
rapid decline in HIV-1 RNA, may have a low risk of selecting for resistance that is comparable overall to 
3-drug regimens. 
The secondary PD non-clinical data indicate that DTG is unlikely to have any significant off-target 
pharmacological activity. DTG has showed no significant effect on cardiac repolarization and the lack of 
significant impact on renal function. The increase of creatinine level observed for DTG is likely due to the 
inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine (OCT2 inhibition), without affecting renal glomerular function. 
However, since OC transport could influence the pharmacodynamic profiles of concomitant medicinal 
products, the co-administration of the FDC with dofetilide (which excretion is dependent upon OCT2) is 
contraindicated because DTG may increase plasma concentrations of this medicinal product. 
Secondary PD of DTG and 3TC are considered to be well established in the clinic. 
No formal PD drug combination studies were conducted for the FDC. Non-clinical data indicate synergy of 
DTG in combination with other anti-HIV therapy classes; and the lack of antagonistic interaction between

3TC and classes of antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral agents. In vitro combination studies have shown 
that DTG has additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity with other classes of ARVs. 
A meta-analysis of clinical pharmacology studies with DTG (substrate of UGT1A) revealed increases in 
DTG exposure due to UGT1A1 polymorphisms, that are not considered clinically significant based on the 
accumulated safety data for DTG. 
Comparing the PK and safety of DTG and 3TC between Japanese and Caucasian healthy subjects did not 
highlight relevant PK differences due to ethnicity.  
DTG, an integrase inhibitor, binds to the HIV integrase active site and thereby blocks the strand transfer 
step of retroviral DNA integration, an essential step in the HIV replication cycle. In selection experiments 
in vitro, resistance development to DTG in wild type virus is slow, and resulting mutant viruses carried 
substitutions resulting for the most in a moderate decrease in DTG susceptibility, referred to as fold 
change (FC):  S153F or S (FC 4), G118R (FC 10) and R263K (FC 2). These mutations are associated with 
a substantial impact on viral fitness. E92Q (FC 3) and G193E (FC 3) have also been selected in vitro but 
are considered secondary without an impact on efficacy alone. Secondary mutations that add up in 
selection experiments do not substantially reverse the reduction in viral fitness. The mentioned qualities 
are the background for the high resistance barrier of DTG that has been verified in a large number of 
clinical trials. In previously untreated patients who were given DTG in combination with 2 NRTIs there 
have been no cases of de novo resistance to DTG or the integrase inhibitor class, to date.  
Some resistance mutations (in combination) that may be selected during failing therapy with first 
generation integrase inhibitors (raltegravir and elvitegravir) are associated with a decrease in DTG 
susceptibility and a reduction in efficacy; mutations of the Q148 pathway in combination with secondary 
mutations (typically G140S or E138K). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of the new fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet has been studied to a sufficient 
extent.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
To support DTG/3TC (fixed dose) dual therapy the company presents the results of two identical studies, 
called GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 (presented below), and one BE study comparing exposures obtained with 
the fixed dose product as compared to those obtained with DTG and 3TC single entities (refer to 
pharmacokinetic section). In the GEMINI studies, previously untreated patients with a screening viral load 
≤500.000 copies/ml (initially ≤100.000, discussed below) and without any major resistance substitutions 
in the RT or PI genome, were given DTG+ 3TC (the dual regimen) or DTG+ TDF/FTC (triple therapy). 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Dolutegravir (study ING112276): No major difference in efficacy was seen for the different doses of 
dolutegravir. A numerically higher relapse rate was seen with the lowest dose of dolutegravir than with 
the 50 mg dose. Dolutegravir trough concentration for a single 50 mg dose in integrase inhibitor naïve 
subjects was 1.20 µg/mL; around 20 times higher than the estimated protein adjusted IC90 for WT virus. 
As no major differences were observed with respect to adverse events between the investigated doses, 
50 mg DTG/d was selected as the dose to be further investigated in INSTI-naïve patients.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
The protocols, including inclusion/exclusion, randomization and therapy, are identical for GEMINI 1 
(study 204861) and GEMINI 2 (205543). Patients were started to be recruited in late March/early April 
2016. 
Title studies: 
-204861 (GEMINI 1) A Phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group, non-inferiority 
study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dolutegravir plus lamivudine compared to 
dolutegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine in HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve adults – Week 48 
-205543 (GEMINI 2) A Phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group, non-inferiority 
study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dolutegravir plus lamivudine compared to 
dolutegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine in HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve adults – Week 48 
Main entry criteria 
Inclusion  
  ART naïve (≤10 days of prior therapy with any ART agent) patients 18 years of age 
 
initially a screening HIV-1 RNA of 1000 to 100,000 c/mL, widened to ≤500,000 c/mL following 
an independent review of accumulated data from other clinical trials* 
Exclusion 
  any major resistance-associated mutation in the Screening or historical resistance test result 
(IAS-USA, 2014]  
  Hepatitis B positive at Screening  
  severe hepatic impairment 
 
creatinine clearance of <50 mL/min/1.73m2 
* Following promising results in two exploratory studies of DTG + 3TC in previously untreated patient 
(PADDLE and particularly ACTG A5353) the viral load criterion was widened ≤500,000 c/mL as part of an 
amendment that was in place on the 5th of November 2016.  
Screening for baseline resistance was done with Q2 Solutions genotypic resistance assay, evaluating the 
reverse transcriptase and protease genes. Resistance screening was done for the RT (of relevance for 
3TC) and PI genome, but not for the integrase. In previously untreated patients (transmitted) integrase 
resistance is very uncommon, and such screening prior to starting therapy is presently not generally 
recommended in clinical practice. 
Hep B co-infected patients should not be treated with 3TC as the only active hep B agent; therefore, the 
dual regimen should not be used in such patients (exclusion criterion). 
Treatment and Treatment assignment 
Treatment: Commercial supply of DTG (Tivicay) in combination with over-encapsulated commercial 
supply tablet of 3TC or TDF/FTC. No dose reductions, modifications in dosage, or changes in the frequency 
of dosing were allowed. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to study treatment in accordance with the computer-generated randomization 
schedule. The central randomization schedule was generated by PPD using a validated SAS developed 
program. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 51/102 
 
 
 
 
Stratification factors: Screening HIV-1 RNA (≤100,000 c/mL or >100,000 c/mL) and Screening CD4+ cell 
count (≤ or >200 cells/mm3). The stratification was centralized and computer-generated randomization. 
Having centralized computer-generated randomization in mind, an imbalance in patients with a BL viral 
load </>100.000 copies in GEMINI-2 is an odd finding (discussed in result section). 
Blinding 
Subjects and Investigators remained blinded during the double-blind randomized phase (up to week 96).  
Study treatment is unblinded during the open-label randomized phase after week 96 up to week 148. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of each of the 2 pivotal studies was to demonstrate non-inferior antiviral activity of 
DTG+3TC versus DTG+TDF/FTC at 48 weeks in HIV-1-infected, ART-naïve subjects. 
The main secondary objectives (up to week 48) included: demonstration of antiviral activity of DTG+3TC 
versus DTG+TDF/FTC at 24 weeks, assessment of viral resistance in subjects meeting CVW criteria, and 
a comparison between the treatment arms, in terms of:   
 
 
 
antiviral activity, immunological effects, and incidence of disease progression over time; 
effect of patient demographic and baseline characteristics on response;  
safety and tolerability over time. 
Endpoints 
At least 4 analyses will evaluate primary and secondary objectives of the protocols when all subjects have 
completed their visits at Week 24, Week 48, Week 96 and at Week 144, where the Week 48 analysis is 
primary and the Week 24 analysis was a secondary analysis performed for regulatory purposes.   
Primary:  proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48 using the Snapshot 
algorithm for the ITT-Exposed (E) Population. 
Main secondary (up to week 48):  
- 
- 
- 
Proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 24;  
Time to viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL); 
Incidence of treatment-emergent genotypic and phenotypic resistance to DTG and 3TC or 
TDF/FTC in subjects meeting criteria for Confirmed Virologic Withdrawal (CVW); 
-  Absolute values and change from BL in CD4 count at Weeks 24 and 48; 
- 
- 
Incidence of disease progression (HIV-associated conditions, AIDS, and death);  
Proportion of subjects by patient subgroup(s) (e.g., by age, race, gender, BL CD4 count) with 
plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Weeks 24 and 48. 
-  Change from BL in CD4 counts at Weeks 24 and 48 by patient subgroups. 
The Abbott Real Time HIV-1 Assay with a lower limit of quantitation of 40 c/mL was used. According to 
EMA, the primary endpoint would rather concern <40 copies/ml. However, such data has also been 
provided, as expected without any meaningful difference in outcomes.  The choice of Endpoints is 
endorsed.

Protocol Amendment (dated 01 December 2017 in Gemini 1, 29 November in Gemini 2) 
There was one amendment to the protocols for this study (dated Nov/Dec 2017), regarding additional 
exploratory endpoints. Endpoints concern weight at weeks 96 and 144, levels of inflammation biomarkers 
(IL-6, hs-CRP) and telemore lengths over time. The results of these endpoints will be presented in future 
reports.  
Sample Size 
Each study is designed to show that DTG + 3TC is non-inferior to a standard three-drug regimen of DTG 
plus TDF/FTC FDC once daily in HIV-1 infected ART-naïve adult subjects. 
Assuming a true response rate of 87% for the DTG + 3TC arm and an 89% response rate for the DTG plus 
TDF/FTC arm, each study requires 347 subjects per arm to have 90% power with a 10% non-inferiority 
margin and a 2.5% one-sided alpha level. 
A non-inferiority margin -10% was considered reasonable in order to demonstrate adequate preservation 
of treatment effect. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint (at Week 48) was analysed using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) 
analysis, adjusting for Baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA (≤100,000 c/mL or >100,000 c/mL) and Baseline 
CD4+ cell count (≤200 cells/mm3 or >200 cells/mm3). A point estimate and corresponding 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) was provided for the adjusted difference in response rates between DTG+3TC 
and DTG+TDF/FTC treatment groups. If rd is the response rate on DTG + 3TC and rf is the response rate 
on DTG + TDF/FTC FDC, then the hypotheses can be written as follows: 
H0: rd – rf ≤ -10%  
H1: rd – rf > -10% 
For each study (204861 and 205543), non-inferiority could be concluded if the lower bound of a two-sided 
95% CI for the difference in response rates between the 2 treatment groups was greater than -10%.   
Efficacy analyses were based on the Intent-to-Treat exposed (ITT-E) analysis population, consisting of all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication, assessed according to their 
randomized treatment regardless of the treatment they received. The Per Protocol (PP) population, 
consisting of subjects in the ITT-E with the exception of significant protocol deviators, was used for the 
sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint. Also, ITT population (all randomised subjects) was analysed. 
Interim analyses were performed: 
3.  A futility analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DTG+3TC when approximately 50% of 
subjects had completed their visit at Week 24.  
4.  Interim analysis to evaluate the secondary endpoints at Week 24.  
Additional interim analyses are planned for repeated efficacy evaluation at Week 96 and Week 144.  
No adjustment for multiplicity was planned for the repeated evaluation of the proportion of subjects with 
HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL.  
Subjects and investigators are to remain blinded during the Double-blind Randomized Phase (up to week 
96). At Week 48 a bias sensitivity analysis was performed to assess whether bias was introduced by the 
Assessment report

Page 53/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unblinded analysis performed at Week 24. Proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA<50 c/mL at 
Week 48 was compared between subjects who reached Week 48 prior and after the Week 24 unblinding.  
In addition to efficacy analyses performed for the individual studies, pooled analyses were performed for 
the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48, study outcomes and subgroups.  
Post-hoc efficacy analysis of homogeneity was performed for the primary endpoint in the pooled data. 
Also, post-hoc efficacy analyses were performed for the individual studies, including sensitivity analysis 
using a more stringent virologic threshold of 40 c/mL, and several subgroups analyses. 
The primary statistical analysis was to be based on a stratified CMH method, which is appropriate 
considering the stratified randomization. Accordingly, the same stratification factors that were used in the 
randomization should also have been used in the primary analysis. The stratified randomization was 
based on screening values, and strata were then re-classified according to the baseline values as those 
were considered more representative of the HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ status immediately prior to 
administration of study treatment. Thus, the baseline stratification factors are used in the primary 
analysis. The stratified primary analysis utilizing the randomization stratification (i.e. screening values) 
was performed on request and its results confirmed the non-inferiority of DTG+3TC to DTG+TDF/FTC in 
each GEMINI study and in the pool across the studies. 
Using different analysis populations for the primary endpoint is endorsed, as both the intention-to-treat 
and per-protocol analyses are to be considered in the assessment of non-inferiority. 
The futility analysis and interim evaluation of proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 24 
is by the applicant not considered to cause multiplicity, as the primary endpoint is specified at Visit 48. 
Given the study results, a multiplicity correction would not have had an impact on the study conclusions. 
However, integrity of the studies was also at risk due to the performed interim analyses, with potential 
implication on the treatment effect estimate, why the bias sensitivity analysis is endorsed. 
The bias sensitivity analysis resulted in somewhat higher response rates in both treatment arms for 
subjects who achieved the primary endpoint after the Week 24 unblind. The applicant does not find this 
an issue in a non-inferiority setting, as both treatment arms are affected. It would be of some interest to 
understand the reason behind this finding (e.g. various study conduct reasons, baselines characteristics 
of subjects who enrolled in the studies at a later time point, reliance on the studies, etc.). A sensitivity 
analysis was performed on request to investigate whether the Week 24 unblind has an impact on the 
non-inferiority results. The stratified primary analysis with an additional factor for bias (i.e. subjects 
reaching week 48 prior to versus after week 24 unblinding) confirmed the non-inferiority of DTG+3TC to 
DTG+TDF/FTC in each GEMINI study and in the pool across the studies.  
Withdrawal/Stopping Criteria 
Subjects permanently discontinuing study treatments prior to Week 148 are considered to be withdrawn 
from the study treatments and also from the study. 
Reasons that may cause discontinuation: 
-  Subject or Investigator non-compliance; 
-  At the request of the subject, Investigator, GSK or ViiV Healthcare; 
-  Need of prohibited co-medications 
Reasons that do cause discontinuation: 
-  Confirmed Virological Withdrawal criteria are met (specified next page); 
-  Need of substitution or dose modification of DTG, 3TC, TDF or FTC; 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 54/102 
 
 
 
- 
Liver toxicity stopping criteria are met, no compelling alternate cause identified; 
-  Renal toxicity criteria are met, no compelling alternate cause identified; 
-  Grade 4 clinical AE considered causally related to study drug  
-  Allergic reaction or rash criteria are met, no compelling alternate cause identified; 
- 
Pregnancy, regardless of termination status of pregnancy  
Confirmed Virologic Withdrawal (CVW) criteria 
Subjects who met any CVW criterion (below) were discontinued from the study, and this triggered 
virologic resistance testing. 
Virologic Non-response 
-  A decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA of <1 log10 c/mL by Week 12, with subsequent confirmation, 
unless plasma HIV-1 RNA is <200 c/mL. 
-  Confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥200 c/mL on or after Week 24. 
Virologic Rebound 
  Confirmed rebound in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels to ≥200 c/mL after prior confirmed suppression to 
<200 c/mL. 
Once a subject was confirmed as meeting a virologic withdrawal criterion, the first sample of the two and 
the Day 1 sample were sent as soon as possible for genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing and the 
result made known to the Investigator if and when available. 
The PRO/RT/integrase assays used in this study are not validated for plasma HIV-1 RNA levels <500 
c/mL. Subjects with confirmed HIV-1 RNA levels between 200 c/mL and <500 c/mL were to be 
transitioned off study drug within 30 days even if no resistance testing data became available. For all 
subjects who met CVW criteria, additional plasma samples were analysed in an attempt to obtain 
genotype/phenotype data on as many samples as possible.

Figure 4 
Included study centers (GEMINI 1 N=87; GEMINI 2, N=104) were located in Argentina, Australia, 
Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Portugal, 
Romania, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, UK and USA. 
The studies started simultaneously (first patient screened 21 and 18 July, respectively), and had a similar 
recruitment pace (last subject last visit for the Week 48 analysis on 29 March and 4 April 2018, 
respectively). The proportion of US patients (or at least sites) is larger in GEMINI 2. 
Screen failures 
The screen failure rate was 29% in GEMINI 1 and 25% in GERMINI 2, main reasons being “evidence of 
baseline resistance“ (12% in both studies), “unlikely to complete the study as planned”(7% in both 
studies), ”physicians decision” (3% and 2%, respectively).

A 12% screening failure due to baseline resistance in previously untreated is a fairly high figure. The main 
part of these screening failures related to NNRTI substitutions (8% of 1974 screened subjects). Only 
around 1% of those screened had a virus with NRTI substitutions and a very low proportion NRTI 
substitutions of relevance for lamivudine (n=4). 
Numbers analyzed 
The number of subjects included in each population was similar across treatment groups in the individual 
studies and in the pooled analysis.(Table 10) 
Table 10 - Summary of Analysis Populations for Studies GEMINI1, GEMINI2 and Pooled Data – 
Randomized Population
The ITT-E population included subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study 
medication. Eight subjects in total in the GEMINI1 and GEMINI2 were randomized but not included in the 
ITT-E population. 
Baseline characteristics 
Baseline parameters were well balanced in GEMINI 1. Two parameters of main interest, and stratified for, 
high baseline viral load and BL CD4 count <200, however, were less well balanced in GEMINI 2. This issue 
was raised. The reason behind this finding was mainly due to errors of staff at time of entering subject 
HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ cell  count values during the randomization procedure, and in part due to 
re-classification of strata due to changes in CD4+ count and HIV-RNA values from screening to baseline. 
It was clarified that this misstratification had a minimal impact, of no relevance, on the efficacy analysis. 
A fairly high proportion, around 30% of patients, is infected with a non-B subtype (see Table 11).

The change from baseline in CD4 count to week 48 was similar between arms, around 220 cells/µL blood. 
Per-protocol population 
Low and even proportions were excluded in the per-protocol population, see Table 15. The response 
rates were fairly identical as compared to that seen in the ITT-population: adjusted difference in 
proportions being -1.9% (GEMINI 1), -0.7% (GEMINI 2) and -1.3% (pooled studies).

Response rate over time 
Proportions with a viral load of <50 copies/ml per scheduled visit were fully similar between arms from 
week 4 and onwards, table. Hence, the reduction of the number of NRTIs from two to one does not seem 
to have relevant effects on the potency of the regimen. (see Table 16).

By baseline CD4 count 
There is a tendency for a lower response rate with the dual regimen for the subset of patients with a low 
baseline CD4 count (<200), reaching significance in GEMINI 2, Table 19. However, numbers are low, and 
the difference in GEMINI-2 is in part driven by the high response rate in the triple-arm (96%, higher than 
in the patients with >200 cells at baseline). Further, the company provided details for all 
“non-responders”, and it was shown that very few patients had virological failure also in the subset of 
patients with a baseline CD4 count of <200. Some details are given beneath the coming table.

When looking at details for “non-responders” with the dual regimen, the following was seen: 
In GEMINI 1: there is one patient with lack of efficacy (350 cps/ml at week 48). This patient had a baseline 
CD4 count of 19, and a high baseline viral load (370.000 cps/ml). No de novo resistance was seen at week 
48. The other 2 patients with >50 cps/ml at week 48 both had low level viremia (112, and 69 cps/mL), 
likely not clinically relevant. The other 3 failures concern 1 patient who was mistakenly randomized (BL 
VL > 2 million), and who was excluded once this was realized, and 2 patients who stopped for other 
reasons (Chagas disease and pulmonary TB), both with a last viral load of <40 cps/ml. 
In GEMINI 2: there are 2 patients with >50 cps/ml at week 48, both had low level viremia (72, and 
71cps/mL). One stopped for other reasons (non-compliance with protocol), where the last viral load 
obtained at week 4 was 100 copies/ml (i.e. adequate virological response). The patient who changed ART 
had a last viral load of <40 copies/ml, and that was the case also for those 3 patients who stopped for 
other reasons (with no virologic data in the week 48 window).  
In summary, the data is reassuring also for the subset of patients with a low baseline CD4 count.

  Response by HIV-1 subtype 
Overall, the response was fully similar for patients infected with subtype B and non-B virus. The overall 
response in non-B subtype was 93% (231/249) with DTG + 3TC and 95% (217/229) with the control 
regimen, (see Table 20).

Note: These data were summarized and provided as part of Tivicay Var 41G. 
When looking at individual subtypes (low numbers) it is noted that patients with subtype AG had a 
numerically lower response rate with the dual regimen. However, details on disposition by subtype was 
provided. In this case, 5/5 of those failing the dural regimen concern “no virologic data in window 
(discontinued due to AE n=1; discontinued for other reasons n=4). Of note, patients infected with with 
non-B subtypes were not over represented in the CVW population (see below in Resistance outcomes in 
non-responders).

Resistance outcomes in non-responders 
The Q2 Solutions genotypic resistance assay (PR and RT) was used to assess pre-treatment resistance for 
subject eligibility at screening.  Integrase Phenosense, Integrase Geneseq and PhenoSense GT on study 
resistance assays were performed at Monogram BioSciences. For further details see Methods. 
INI resistance pre-specified mutations included H51Y, T66A/I/K, L74M, E92Q/V/G, Q95K, T97A, G118R, 
F121Y, E138A/K/D, G140A/C/S, Y143C/H/R/K/S/G/A, P145S, Q146P,S147G, Q148H/K/R, V151I/L/A,

resistance mutations to other classes (NRTI,NNRTI, PI) are as defined by the IAS-USA most recent 
guidelines available at the time of DBF [Wensing, 2017] 
Resistance data has been presented for patients who met criteria for CVW, and in addition for those who 
left the study, and where the last viral load was >400 copies/ml. There was no treatment emergent INSTI

or NRTI resistance observed in any of these cases, neither in the dual arms, nor the triple arms, details 
shown in two coming tables. These analyses only concern 8 patients total who were treated with the dual 
regimen and 6 treated with the triple regimen, to be compared to pooled data of 20 (dual) and 13 patients 
(triple) with a plasma >= 50 copies in the 48 week window, and 41 (dual) and 35 (triple) patients with ”No 
virologic data in the 48 week window”. For transparency, the company was asked to present viral load 
strata (>=50 and <100; >=100 and <200; >=200 and <400; >=400) for all non-responders (from 
window period and last visit, respectively). As seen here, in practice all patients who “discontinued for 
other reasons” indeed had an undetectable viral load at the last time point of monitoring. (see Table 
22,Table 23,Table 24).

The 48 weeks results of the GEMINI studies were already presented as part of Tivicay Variation 41G. In this variation the company also presented resistance data 
on patients who left the study (i.e. without having met criteria for Confirmed Virological Wihdrawal Criteria), and where the last viral load was >400 c/mL (i.e. 
meaningful to analyze for resistance). This concerned another two patients per regimen (total 4), with the same outcome as above (no de novo resistance, and 
unchanged susceptibilities by phenotypic assay). 
Individual graphs on viral loads and CD4-count over time were provided for all patients with Confirmed or Suspected Virological Withdrawal criteria (data not 
shown in this report). When looking at these graphs (where also no resistance was detected at failure) it is clear that the majority had simply stopped to take 
the medication for a period of time. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Studies in special populations apply to previous studies performed with 3TC and dolutegravir. 
With regards to younger patients, the proposed FDC formulation consists of 50 mg DTG and 300 mg 3TC, adult doses already authorized as individual agents for 
the treatment of HIV infection in adolescents ≥12 years of age weighing ≥40 kg (DTG), or in paediatric patients weighing ≥25 kg (3TC).  Hence, the fixed dose 
product can be used in adolescents from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Pooled results have been shown along with the individual study results in previous sections. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No clinical studies were performed in children or adolescents according with the applicant prior studies 
have shown that DTG and 3TC PK exposures in adolescents are sufficiently similar to those in adults; 
these PK correlations permits the extrapolation of efficacy data in adults to adolescents (the proposed 
indication is for adolescents weighting ≥25 Kg and ≥ 12 years of age). 
Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Class C) as determined by Child-Pugh classification or with a 
Creatinine clearance of <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 via the CKD-EPI method were excluded from this studies 
(GEMINI 1 and 2). 
Although there are limited data on DTG and 3TC PK in elderly subjects, analyses from historical studies in 
HIV-1 infected adult subjects indicated that age had no clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics 
of DTG or 3TC. (see Table 27.) 
DTG 
Based on a population PK analysis, age had no clinically significant effect on DTG PK and no age-related 
DTG dose adjustment is needed. Pharmacokinetic data of DTG in subjects of >65 years old are very 
limited. 
3TC 
In elderly Japanese patients (LB-05), the age-related reduction in CLr resulted in a moderate (40%), but 
clinically insignificant, increase in daily exposure. Other parameters were not significantly affected and 
dose modification is not required on the basis of age alone, unless accompanied by significant impairment 
in renal function. Pharmacokinetic data of 3TC in subjects of >65 years old are very limited.

Adolescent Extrapolation GSK Document Number 2018N363795_00: Adolescent Extrapolation report for 
GSK3515864 
The proposed FDC formulation consists of 50 mg DTG and 300 mg 3TC which are adult doses that have 
already been authorized as individual agents in adolescents ≥12 years of age weighing ≥40 kg (DTG) or 
in pediatric patients weighing ≥25 kg (3TC). 
The available PK data from pediatric subjects (both observed and modelled), including adolescents ≥ 12 
to <18 years, demonstrate that DTG and 3TC exposures are sufficiently similar to adults to permit 
extrapolation of efficacy data from pharmacokinetic correlation. 
Assessment report

The data from pivotal BE Study 204994, combined with data from the 3TC historical studies, provides an 
acceptable PK bridge to the single entities used in GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 Phase III trials, ensures 
similarity in terms of safety and efficacy and supports the adolescent indication for the DTG/3TC FDC 
product. 
The totality of evidence supports the rationale of an extrapolation approach from adults to adolescents 
and from the individual DTG plus 3TC to the DTG/3TC FDC. The DTG/3TC 50mg/300mg FDC is 
recommended as a once-daily complete regimen administered with or without food for the treatment of 
HIV-1 infection in ART-naïve adolescents (≥12 years to <18 years of age, weighing at least 40 kg). 
2.5.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 (first recruitment in late March/early April 2016) were blinded with regards to the 
NRTI agents (3TC vs TDF/FTC), DTG (as Tivicay) was given open label. This treatment was given to 
previously untreated patients, where an initial viral load cap of 100.000 copies/mL was increased to 
500.000 copies/ml. CD4 count < and ≥200 cells/µL blood at screening was a stratification factor, and 
following the widening of viral load entry criteria, also HIV-RNA <100.000 and ≥100.000 copies/mL 
plasma. These stratification factors are considered adequate. The two studies were of identical design, 
including the control regimen. This is considered acceptable. The issue of main interest when comparing 
this slimmed dual regimen to common triple therapy is whether the addition of one well tolerated 
nucleoside analogue (3TC) to DTG is sufficient from an efficacy point of view, where 2 NRTIs as part of 
triple therapy has been the practice in HIV therapy for two decades. DTG+ TDF/FTC, the control regimen 
on both studies, is a widely-recommended triple therapy regimen, and there are no regimens that would 
be considered more effective to date. 
The primary end point (<50 copies/mL at week 48, snap shot analysis) and the non-inferiority margin 
(10%) are in line with EMA recommendations. The lower limit of detection with the assay used was <40 
copies/ml. Formally, EMA has stated the primary end point then should concern <40 copies/ml (i.e. assay 
cut off in), however, in practice this has no relevance for the comparison of outcomes, and these figures 
were also presented.   
The patient population is, in comparison to that seen in most recent trials, fairly broad: patients from a 
wide range of countries/regions were included, and a round one third were infected with HIV of non-B 
subtypes, a higher figure than in most other more recent studies. As in studies of other recent 
applications, the proportion of female patients were low (15%), the proportion with a low CD count limited 
(around 10%) as well as those with a high baseline viral load (>100.000), around 20%.  
Resistance screening concerned the RT and PI genomes, and only patients infected with HIV-1 without 
such major mutations were included (IAS-USA, 2014). Screening did not concern integrase class 
resistance, which is in line with common clinical practice; major mutations to that class are very 
infrequently detected in previously untreated patients to date. 
The primary statistical analysis was to be based on a stratified CMH method, which is appropriate 
considering the stratified randomization. Accordingly, the same stratification factors that were used in the 
randomization should also have been used in the primary analysis. The stratified randomization was 
based on screening values, and strata were then re-classified according to the baseline values as those 
were considered more representative of the HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ status immediately prior to 
administration of study treatment. Thus, the baseline stratification factors are used in the primary 
analysis. The stratified primary analysis utilizing the randomization stratification (i.e. screening values) 
was performed on request and its results confirmed the non-inferiority of DTG+3TC to DTG+TDF/FTC in 
each GEMINI study and in the pool across the studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 75/102 
 
 
 
 
The bias sensitivity analysis resulted in somewhat higher response rates in both treatment arms for 
subjects who achieved the primary endpoint after the Week 24 unblind. A sensitivity analysis is performed 
on request to investigate whether the Week 24 unblind has an impact on the non-inferiority results. The 
stratified primary analysis with an additional factor for bias (i.e. subjects reaching week 48 prior to versus 
after week 24 unblinding) confirmed the non-inferiority of DTG+3TC to DTG+TDF/FTC in each GEMINI 
study and in the pool across the studies. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The DTG + 3TC dual regimen was non-inferior to the triple control regimen in both studies, at week 48. 
While the point estimate favours the triple regimen in GEMINI 1 (90 vs 93%; adjusted difference -2.6% 
(-6.7, 1.5)), results were very similar in GEMINI 2 (93 vs 94%; adjusted difference -0.7% (-4.3, 2.9)).  
From a virological point of view it is re-assuring to note that the response rate with the dual regimen was 
fully similar to control in patients with a baseline viral load >100.000, 129/142 (92%) vs 153/138 (90%). 
The number of “non-responders” was somewhat higher with the dual regimen for patients with a baseline 
CD4 count <200. However, numbers are low, and when looking at details for these “non-responders” it 
was clarified that non-response was in practice not “virological”, but linked to other reasons (mainly 
stopping therapy for other reasons, with a last viral load <40 copies/ml). In summary, the dual regimen 
yielded fully similar efficacy as did the triple regimen, both in patients with a high baseline viral load, and 
in those with a low baseline CD4 count (limited numbers studied). 
Outcomes by demographic factors were consistent with that of the overall population, i.e. similar between 
arms. That is true also when looking at HIV subtypes, with an overall response rate that was fully similar 
for those infected with non-B subtypes, 93% (231/249) with DTG + 3TC and 95% (217/229) with the 
control regimen, as compared to those infected with subtype B, 91 and 93%, respectively.  Numbers of 
individual non-B subtypes treated (such as subtype C) are, however, limited. The results of the studies 
are considered generalizable across HIV subtypes in an EU setting, where resistance screening and viral 
load monitoring is in place. 
Resistance outcomes in those failing therapy are of high interest when evaluating the slimmed regimens. 
No de novo resistance to the integrase class or to the NRTI class (3TC in the case of the dual regimen) was 
seen; neither with the dual regimen nor with the triple regimen. This is a re-assuring outcome, and in line 
with that seen in previous dolutegravir-based studies in previously untreated patients. 
2.5.4  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
No relevant difference in efficacy is seen with the dual regimen as compared to DTG+ 2 NRTIs (TDF/FTC). 
Of importance, also with the dual regimen there is a lack of resistance in non-responders, in line with what 
has been reported so far with DTG-based triple therapy in previously untreated patients. The GEMINI 
studies are therefore supportive for the use of DTG plus 3TC for the treatment of patients infected with 
HIV-1 with no known or suspected resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, or 3TC.  
The fixe dose product, Dovato, delivers the adult dose of DTG (50 mg) and 3TC (300 mg), and is suitable 
for the treatment of adults and adolescents of age 12 and above with a weight of at least 40 kilos (in line 
with the dosing of the individual agents). 
2.6 Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety of the new fixed-dose combination of DTG and 3TC for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in 
patients without known or suspected resistance to either antiretroviral component, has been evaluated in 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 76/102 
 
 
 
 
two identical pivotal phase III trials with DTG+TDF/FTC as a comparator (GEMINI 1 and 2). In those 
studies, a total of 716 treatment naïve HIV-1 positive subjects received at least one dose of DTG+3TC at 
the recommended dose of 50 mg+300 mg administered orally once daily. 
Both DTG and 3TC are already approved for monotherapies as well as in different combinations and there 
is extensive post-marketing experience.  
Dolutegravir (marketed as Tivicay) has over 560 000 patient years’ exposure according to the prescribing 
data of March 2018. The combination DTG/3TC/ABC (Triumeq) has over 445 000 patient years´ from its 
approval in 2014 up to March 2018. Lamuvidine has alone or in combinations with other ART products 
(Kivexa, Combivir, Trizivir or Triumeq) over 7 million patient years´ exposures up to January 2018. The 
combination DTG/3TC together with ABC (Triumeq) has over 445 000 patient years´ as of March 2018. In 
those products the recommended dose for treatment of HIV is in adults is 50 mg DTG once daily (twice 
daily in case of INI resistance) and for 3TC the dose 300 mg once daily or 150 mg twice daily. The safety 
of DTG and 3TC is therefore considered well established since it has been used in different ART 
combinations in large amount patients during the last years. 
Altogether, the safety database is considered sufficient to evaluate the safety of DTG+3TC. (see Table 
28). 
Table 28 - Subject Disposition for the Subject Conclusion Record 
A high proportion (91%) of the DTG+3TC treated subjects are still ongoing in the study at Week 48 
database freeze cut-off. Primary reason for withdrawal was similar in the two treatment arms, where lost 
to follow up was most commonly reported.  
Historical safety data of treatment with higher doses 
Both DTG and 3TC exposures achieved with the new co-formulation exceed the limits specified in the 
guidelines regarding relative bioavailability. The GMR for DTG AUC was 16% higher than reference, with 
an upper bound for CI90% just passing the 125% margin; Cmax was within the 125% margin. These 
differences were seen when the exposures were studied in fasted state. Food effects on DTG differ for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 77/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FDC and DTG as single agent (Tivicay), and in a fed state it is likely that the upper BE margin would have 
been met. For 3TC, a 30% higher Cmax was yielded with the FDC, than with lamivudine as single entity 
(GMRs for AUC and Cmin being with the BE margins). According to the Rapporteur, these increases (DTG 
AUC, 3TC Cmax) are not considered clinically relevant. Regarding 3TC there are data available to support 
the safety also for a slightly higher exposure. A dose of 300 mg twice daily has been administered to 
>9 000 subjects without any change in the safety profile. Also, alternative dosing regimens have been 
evaluated with exposures comparable to what is achieved with Dovato (see below) without any signs of 
any changes in the safety profile. Hence, the higher Cmax for 3TC described in the pharmacokinetic 
section is therefore not considered clinically relevant. Similarly, for DTG, a higher dose (50 mg twice 
daily) has been studied in the VIKING-3 and -4 in a total of 213 subjects without signs of a difference in 
safety profile compared to 50 mg x 1. Although these studies were without an active comparator, they 
provide grounds for accepting a slightly higher DTG exposure (under fasting conditions) with the new 
FDC. 
The applicant has provided the following summary of the DTG and 3TC component used at higher doses 
in order to justify the divergences:  
DTG Component 
In addition to the approved dosing of DTG 50 mg once daily, DTG 50 mg is also approved for twice daily 
administration (for use in patients when certain INSTI associated resistance substitutions or clinically 
suspected INSTI resistance are present). In a registrational Phase 3 study of DTG (ING112574), 
substantially higher steady state AUC values were obtained with 50 mg twice daily doses compared with 
once daily doses without additional safety concerns. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions in 
ING112574 were generally similar compared with observations with the 50-mg once-daily dose in Phase 
3 trials. 
3TC Component 
Clinical safety data from registrational studies of 3TC demonstrate that the observed ~32% increase in 
3TC Cmax exposure does not impact patient safety. Several previously-submitted dose-ranging, pivotal 
and open-label studies have demonstrated no dose-related increase in the overall incidence of AEs and no 
significant safety differences between the standard 3TC 300 mg/day dose and the higher 3TC 600 mg/day 
dose. In total has more than 9 000 subjects been treated with a dose of 3TC 600 mg/day. 
In two dose-ranging studies (NUCA2001 and NUCB2001), 201 HIV-infected participants received 3TC 
monotherapy at doses from ~35 mg/day (0.5 mg/kg/day) to ~1400 mg/day (20 mg/kg/day) for at least 
24 weeks. In these studies, the Cmax following repeated 560-mg, 840-mg, and 1400-mg total daily doses 
were similar to or greater than the predicted steady-state 3TC Cmax for the bilayer FDC. Ninety-two 
subjects received doses ≥560 mg/day, of who 62 received 840 mg/day or 1400 mg/day. These studies 
demonstrated no dose-related increase in the overall incidence of AEs or the overall incidence of study 
drug related AEs over 24 weeks. In NUCA2001, at the 20 mg/kg/day (1400 mg/day) dose level, 
hematologic laboratory abnormalities were noted in some subjects. Sustained Grade 3/Grade 4 
neutropenia was seen in 4 of 15 subjects and led to withdrawal in 1 subject. There was an increased 
incidence of decreased red blood cell counts (in 8 of 15) at the 20 mg/kg/day dose level. However, there 
was no dose-related increase in the incidence of either hemoglobin declines nor was there a dose-related 
increase in the incidence of clinically significant anemia. The increased incidence of hematologic 
laboratory abnormalities was not seen at the lower dose levels. In NUCB2001, the laboratory data 
revealed no major toxicities related to 3TC treatment and there was no obvious dose-response. While an 
increased incidence of hematologic laboratory abnormalities was seen at 1400 mg/day in NUCA2001, this 
was not seen with the 1400 mg/day in NUCB2001. These studies show that 3TC at doses of up to 840 
mg/day were generally well-tolerated, with no dose associated increase in the incidence of clinical AEs or 
laboratory toxicities. The predicted 3TC steady-state Cmax for the bilayer DTG/3TC FDC (the formulation 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 78/102 
 
 
 
 
chosen for development) in fasted state (which represents the highest exposure) is similar to the 
observed range of steady-state Cmax values from 840 mg/day. 
Across the 3 randomized, controlled studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, and NUCB3002), study participants 
received 3TC for at least 24 weeks as either 600 mg/day monotherapy (in NUCA3001), 600 mg/day + 
ZDV, or 300 mg/day + ZDV. A fourth study, NUCB3001, examined the safety of 3TC 600 mg/day + ZDV 
in comparison with ZDV monotherapy. These studies showed no significant safety differences between 
the 3TC 300 mg total daily dose and the 3TC 600 mg total daily dose. The overall differences at the 
individual study level between treatment groups were small and statistically nonsignificant when 
comparing the frequencies of AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, Grade 3/4 clinical and laboratory 
abnormalities, and withdrawals due to AEs over the ≥24-week treatment period. 
Some individual AEs and laboratory abnormalities (including abdominal pain, diarrhea, anemia, 
musculoskeletal pain, decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets) were reported with slightly 
higher frequency for participants who received 3TC 600 mg/day + ZDV compared to those who received 
3TC 300 mg/day + ZDV or 3TC 600 mg/day monotherapy, but in most instances, these were not cause for 
withdrawal from the study. Similarly, there were certain AEs, including headache, neuropathy, dizziness, 
temperature regulation disturbances, and various infections/viral infections that were reported more 
frequently in the 3TC 300 mg/day compared to the 3TC 600 mg/day groups. However, relative differences 
for these AEs were small (ranging from <1% up to 4%). In addition, review of SAEs, grouped by body 
system, identified <1% reporting frequency in both arms for the majority of SAEs. Over half of the SAEs 
were not considered drug-related. 
The following information has been provided in the Summary of Clinical Safety and Summary of Clinical 
Pharmacology: 
Cross-study Comparisons of Lamivudine Cmax and AUC 
A cross-study comparison indicates that the 3TC Cmax (geometric mean of 3.22 µg/mL) observed with 
the DTG/3TC proposed commercial formulation was of a similar magnitude to that observed with Epivir in 
various SE studies such as NUCA1006, NUCB1004, and NUCA1005 (3.09 µg/mL, 3.33 µg/mL, and 3.15 
µg/mL, respectively). In addition, similar Cmax values (3.67 µg/mL and 3.42 µg/mL) were also observed 
under fasted conditions in BE studies for generic 3TC formulations (EMA, 2009, and MHRA, 2016, 
respectively)  
3TC demonstrates linear, time-invariant PK with Cmax and AUC values that increase in proportion µto the 
dose. A comparison of predicted steady-state 3TC Cmax for the bilayer FDC tablet (300 mg QD) to 
observed steady-state Cmax values from historical Epivir Phase I/IIa and Phase III studies is shown in the 
figure below. The steady-state Cmax of the bilayer FDC was estimated by multiplying the observed Cmax 
(in either the fasted or fed state) by 1.48, which is the previously reported accumulation ratio for a 3TC 
300 mg once daily regimen (NUCA2001). In the pivotal BE study 204994, the 3TC terminal elimination 
t1/2 of the bilayer FDC was similar to that of Epivir (See m2.7.1, Section 2.1.1.1). Therefore, 3TC 
accumulation following administration of the FDC is expected to be similar to that observed with the SE in 
Study NUCA2001. 
The Figure 5 illustrates the following: 
- 
The predicted 3TC steady-state Cmax for the bilayer FDC in the fasted state (which represents the 
scenario for highest exposure) is similar to the observed range of steady-state Cmax values from 
doses ≥12 mg/kg/day (840 mg daily dose for a 70-kg subject) given in BID divided doses to 
subjects for 24 weeks in the NUCA2001 and NUCB2001 dose-ranging studies. 
- 
The predicted steady-state 3TC Cmax for the bilayer FDC in the fed state overlaps with the 
steady-state Cmax range observed for 300 mg BID (BID) 
Assessment report

- 
In the two dose-ranging studies (NUCA2001 and NUCB2001), 201 HIV-infected participants 
received 3TC monotherapy at doses from ~35 mg/day (0.5 mg/kg/day) to ~1400 mg/day (20 
mg/kg/day) for at least 24 weeks. In these studies, the Cmax following repeated 560-mg, 
840-mg, and 1400-mg total daily doses were similar to or greater than the predicted steady-state 
3TC Cmax for the bilayer FDC (figure above). Ninety-two subjects received doses ≥560 mg/day, 
of who 62 received 840 mg/day or 1400 mg/day. These studies demonstrated no dose-related 
increase in the overall incidence of AEs or the overall incidence of study drug related AEs over 24 
weeks.  
-  Across the 3 randomized, controlled studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, and NUCB3002), study 
participants received 3TC for at least 24 weeks either as 600 mg/day monotherapy (in 
NUCA3001), 600 mg/day + ZDV, or 300 mg/day + ZDV. A fourth study, NUCB3001, examined 
the safety of 3TC 600 mg/day + ZDV in comparison with ZDV monotherapy. Number of subjects 
in these studies was 65 to around 90 per treatment arm. These studies showed no significant 
safety differences between the 3TC 300 mg total daily dose and the 3TC 600 mg total daily dose. 
There were no statistically significant differences by treatment groups within each study 
(NUCA3001, NUCB3001, NUCA3002 and NUCB3002) in the frequency of treatment-related AEs.

Deaths 
Two cases of death were reported, both were in the DTG+3TC arm. None of them were considered related 
to therapy by the investigator. Reviewing the data, it is agreed that none of these deaths were indicative 
of causality to therapy. 
o  Subject S11 (DTG + 3TC group) was age 30 to 40 years and died on Study Day 205 due to 
hypotension and cardiac arrest. The subject was diagnosed with Burkitt´s lymphoma.  
o  Subject S12 (DTG + 3TC group) was age 40 to 50 years and died on Study Day 357 due to 
acute myocardial infarction which was verified at autopsy. The subject had a history of smoking 
and possible drug abuse.  
AEs of special interest  
Adverse events of interest (AESI) focused on AEs associated with administration of INIs and NRTIs. 
Rash 
Rash was reported at comparable frequencies in the subjects in the two treatment arms (4% DTG+3TC vs 
6% DTG+TDF/FTC). Drug-related events of rash were reported at a somewhat higher frequency in the 
DTG+FTC/TDF arm (7 vs 2 events). A wide range in time to onset has been presented, where the majority 
of the cases were reported >35 days after initial treatment.

All psychiatric related AEs that were possibly drug-related were reported at a frequency of <1% in bot 
treatment groups, except for insomnia that occurred in 2% of the DTG+3TC treated subjects and in 3% 
of the DTG+TDF/FTC treated subjects. Possibly drug-related AEs within this SOC leading to withdrawal 
occurred in <1% of the subjects.  
Suicide attempts 
Up to the Week 48 database freeze suicide attempts and self-injury was reported at similar frequency in 
both treatment groups. (see Table 33).

Depression 
Depression was reported in 3% of the subjects in each treatment group, of those were 3 of the subject in 
the DTG+3TC group and 5 in the DTG+TDF/FTC group reported as possible drug-related. Depression was 
more frequently reported among subjects that had a history of depression at Baseline, about 10% of 
those experienced emergent depression during treatment compared with 2% of the subjects without a 
history of depression. In each group, 2 subjects experienced severe depression Grade 3 or 4. Two 
subjects (1 in each group) had depression AEs that led to withdrawal. 
Anxiety 
Anxiety was reported in 23 (3%) of the subjects in the DTG+3TC group and in 18 (3%) of the subjects in 
the DTG+TDF/FTC group. Drug-related events were reported in 9 (DTG + 3TC) and 5 (TDF/FTC) subjects. 
Two subjects (1 in each group) had anxiety-related AEs that led to withdrawal. 
Sleep disorders 
Insomnia was reported in 27 (4%) of the DTG+3TC treated subject and in 45 (6%) of those treated with 
DTG+TDF/FTC. All events were Grade 1 or 2. Insomnia was also the most common drug-related event in 
the SOC psychiatric disorders (DTG+3TC 13 [2%] and DTG+TDF/FTC 18 [3%]). One event of 
insomnia-related AE in the DTG+3TC group resulted in withdrawal. 
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) 
In the GEMINI studies 39 subjects in total experienced HIV-associated conditions, AEs, or SAEs that may 
be associated with IRIS. Four subjects were adjudicated as having possible IRIS (2 in each treatment 
group). This risk is a seemingly unavoidable aspect of the immune reconstitution that follows the initiation 
of effective ART in patients with sub-normal CD4 counts. 
Other AEs of Special Interest 
Few cases of cardiovascular events (4+3 events) were reported at similar frequency in both treatment 
groups. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology parameters 
There were only mild and very limited changes from baseline in haemoglobin, white blood cell count 
(including leukocytes and neutrophils), or platelets observed in none of the two treatment groups up to 
the Week 48 database freeze.  
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Over the period of time of which GEMINI 1 and 2 were conducted, outbreaks of hepatitis A virus were 
reported among men who have sex with men in many regions, including some of the countries in Europe.  
The numbers of subject that met liver event stopping criteria was low in both treatment groups (2%). One 
subject in the DTG+3TC group was considered by the investigator to have possible DTG-related DILI. The 
subject had increased levels of ALT. However, the bilirubin was normal and therefore the criteria of Hy’s 
law have not been fulfilled. The subject left the study and ALT levels went back to normal after change of 
treatment, which suggest that this elevation of ALT was drug related.

Renal function 
DTG inhibits the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT-2) resulting in increased levels of serum creatinine 
without a change in actual filtration rate. Therefore, cystatin C serves as a better biomarker for renal 
function and in both GEMINI studies the use of cystatin C shown that both groups improved their renal 
function after initiation of ART. According to the applicant, data for cystatin C is only available from 
baseline and week 24 and 48, however, the data of serum creatinine and GFR (Figure 6 and Figure 7) 
suggest that the main difference between the treatment groups occurs up to week 4, thereafter a similar 
trend was seen for both groups. 
The total numbers of reported AEs from the renal and urinary disorders SOC were similar in both 
treatment groups (4%). See Table 34, Table 35.

from CREAT Adjusted using CKD-EPI (mL/min/1.73m2) Over Time – MMRM analysis, pooled 
data from GEMINI 1 and 2 
There was a statistically significant difference between the two treatment regimens for urine 
protein/creatinine, beta-2 microglobulin/creatinine, and retinol binding protein/creatinine from baseline 
to Week 48. However, when viewing the tabulated data for serum creatinine every fourth week, it is 
obvious that the largest part of change occurs already between baseline and Week 4. This is the interval 
when the separation between DTG/3TC and the TDF-containing control group occurs, seemingly due to 
more direct effects of TDF other than long-term loss of filtration capacity. Creatinine based GFR also 
indicate a difference in renal function between the two treatment arms from baseline up to Week 4 where 
the DTG+3TC has a higher mean GFR compared to DTG+TDF/FTC treatment. Thereafter a similar trend 
of renal improvement for DTG+3TC and DTG+TDF/FTC was observed from Week 4 up to Week 48. 
Lipid parameters 
Statistical analysis of change from baseline in fasting lipids at Week 48 showed that subjects treated with 
DTG + 3TC had a mean increase in LDL and HDL values at Week 48 compared with baseline, whereas 
subjects in the DTG + TDF/FTC group had a mean decrease for LDL cholesterol and a small mean increase 
in HDL cholesterol at Week 48 compared with baseline. Both treatment groups showed an overall 
reduction in the mean total cholesterol/HDL ratio, with a greater reduction in the DTG + TDF/FTC group 
(p = 0.018). Subjects treated with DTG + 3TC showed a small mean increase in triglycerides compared 
with a small mean decrease in subjects treated with DTG + TDF/FTC; the difference between treatment 
groups was statistically significant (p = 0.046). The difference between the treatment groups is most 
likely attributable to the known lipid-lowering effect of TDF. 
Bone biomarkers 
HIV infection is associated with a higher prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) and a decrease in 
BMD is commonly occurring at initiation of ART. At Week 48 in the pooled analysis, a larger increase in 
bone turnover markers were observed in the DTG + TDF/FTC group compared with the DTG+3TC group. 
Whether this translates into clinical benefit in form of reduced risk of low BMD cannot be concluded based 
on biomarkers only and not without a significantly longer time of follow-up.

Safety in special populations 
The study population was dominated by the white males below the age of 35. No children were included. 
The overall AEs frequencies did not substantially differ with gender, age or race.  
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnant or breastfeeding women were excluded from enrolment in the GEMINI studies. Up to Week 48 
four women (two in each treatment group) discontinued the study due to pregnancy. Two of the subjects 
had elective abortion and the other two had spontaneous abortion (one in each treatment group) within 
the first trimester. No congenital abnormalities were reported in two of the cases (one spontaneous and 
one elective abortion), for the other two cases no information was provided from the sites. 
In one still ongoing birth outcome surveillance study in Botswana (Tsepamo study), there have been 4 
cases (as of May 2018) of neural tube defects reported in 426 infants born to mothers who were exposed 
to DTG-containing regimens from the time of conception. The use of DTG in pregnant women has been 
thoroughly discussed in PRAC and there are recent agreements to update section 4.6 for products 
containing DTG, the SmPC of Dovato has therefore been updated accordingly.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Due to different routes of metabolism and elimination and minimal effect of DTG and 3TC on drug 
metabolizing enzymes or transporters, no clinically significant drug interactions are expected between 
DTG and 3TC. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Discontinuations due to AEs were similar between the two treatment arms. AEs leading to discontinuation 
were most commonly reported from the SOCs psychiatric disorders and infections. (see Table 37).

Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing experience of the fixed dose combination of DTG/3TC FDC is available. 
2.6.1 Discussion on clinical safety 
Given that the current DTG+3TC combination is de facto a reduction of the approved, and extensively 
used, combination DTG/ABC/3TC, it can a priori be concluded that the safety profile of DTG and 3TC is 
well-characterised.  
The choice of a DTG+TDF/FTC control arm in the GEMINI programme does not allow for a direct 
assessment of any potential benefit over the existing DTG/ABC/3TC FDC but given that ABC has some 
tolerability issues and that ABC-containing regimens require HLA-B57:01 testing before initiation, there 
are potential safety benefits of this reduced regimen if efficacy is fully preserved. 
The direct scientific value of the GEMINI safety dataset is mainly to investigate whether frequencies of 
AEs or laboratory abnormalities differ in comparison to the DTG+FTC/TDF control arms. As FTC, similarly 
to 3TC, is well-tolerated the comparison can be reduced to whether the exclusion of TDF translates to 
clinical safety benefits. TDF has previously been associated to changes in renal function including renal 
failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphatemia, and proximal tubulopathy (including 
Fanconi syndrome), mainly in patients co-medicated with pharmacoenhancers (ritonavir or cobicistat) 
given as a part of a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. In the GEMINI studies, difference in 
biomarkers relevant to renal health and function were observed between baseline and Week 4 in favour 
of the DTG/3TC arms compared to the TDF-containing control arms, however, after Week 4 a similar 
trend was observed for the two treatment arms. Therefore, the initial difference is seemingly related to 
more direct effects of TDF rather than long-term loss of filtration capacity. 
2.6.2 Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of DTG+3TC is already well-established, which is confirmed by the 48-week GEMINI 
safety data presented within this application. No new specific safety concerns for the dual treatment of 
DTG+3TC have been identified.

The risk of resistance is not a safety issue as such and can be closely monitored through case reporting 
and literature review. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
The risks of hypersensitivity reaction, hepatobiliary disorders, serious rash and Neural tube defects have 
ongoing additional pharmacovigilance activities which are described in the dolutegravir (Tivicay) RMP.  
A target Follow-up questionnaire has also been set up for the risk of Neural tube defects for the DTG/3TC 
FDC.

3.   Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1  Therapeutic context 
Present antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV-infection, it is a life-long treatment. For the last two 
decades treatment has consisted of triple therapy, 2 NRTIs (typically abacavir/3TC or TDF/FTC) in 
combination with 1 agent of other class (PI, NNRTI or INI). Three agents have been combined in order to 
create a sufficient barrier to resistance.  Boosted protease inhibitors and the second-generation integrase 
inhibitors (presently DTG and bictegravir), are agents with a high resistance barrier, where the addition 
of two NRTIs (or other agents) is not necessarily needed. Successful outcomes have previously been 
presented with dual therapy consisting of darunavir/ritonavir (“boosted PI”, counting as 1 agent) plus 
lamivudine, and for DTG plus rilpivirine. However, these studies were so called switch studies, done in 
patients with ongoing therapy and suppressed viral loads.  The present application concerns treatment 
with DTG + 3TC dual therapy in previously untreated patients, i.e. where the viral load is high when 
therapy is started. 
Reducing life-long therapy by one agent without a negative impact on efficacy and the risk of resistance 
development is naturally warranted. No agents can be considered fully free from side effects, seen daily 
or potentially after long term therapy. 3TC, added to DTG in this fixed dose regimen, is considered to have 
a quite favourable safety profile, without known long term toxicities. 
3.1.1 Disease or condition 
The Applicant seeks the following therapeutic indication for Dovato: 
Assessment report  
EMA/267082/2019  
Page 95/102 
 
 
 
 
“Dovato is indicated for the treatment of human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in 
adults and adolescents above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg, with no known or suspected 
resistance to the integrase inhibitor class or lamivudine.” 
HIV-infection has become a manageable chronic disease. In the EU several drugs of different drug classes 
are approved for antiretroviral therapy of HIV-1 infected patients, for both patients not previously treated 
(naïve) and patients in need of a change in therapy.  
For many years the proportion of subjects at Week 48 with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, has been 
a well-established surrogate endpoint for antiviral efficacy and, hence, prognosis of HIV-1 infection and 
disease. 
3.1.2 Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment guidelines recommend a combination of 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors plus an agent from a different class, i.e. a triple combination regimen.  
Triple therapy, with the intention to create a “resistance barrier of 3”, has been used since 1996/1997.  
However, some agents have a resistance barrier that is > 1. Boosted PIs have such qualities, and 
darunavir/r given in monotherapy or in combination with 3TC yielded similar results as darunavir/r + 2 
NRTIs as maintenance therapy (i.e. in switch studies in virologically suppressed patients). DTG has also 
a resistance barrier >1, and maintenance therapy with DTG+ rilpivirine (rilpivirine with a resistance 
barrier of 1) yielded the same high response rate as DTG+ 2 NRTIs in two large scale trials, the SWORD 
1 + 2 studies, pivotal for the approval of that fixed dose regimen.  
If DTG+3TC in combination provide a sufficient regimen efficacy wise, without an increased risk of 
resistance development, this would reduce the cumulative drug exposure, provide a potential safety 
advantage and reduce costs.  
In addition, over the past years one focus of drug development has become co-formulation of all active 
substances to form single tablet, once daily, antiretroviral regimens. Improved tolerability, safety, and 
simple dosing regimens are important drivers of good adherence and hence lessen the risk of 
development of drug resistance. 
3.1.3 Main clinical studies 
To support DTG/3TC (fixed dose) dual therapy the company presents the results of two identical studies, 
called GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2, and one BE study comparing exposures obtained with the fixed dose 
product as compared to those obtained with DTG and 3TC single entities. In the GEMINI studies, 
previously untreated patients with a screening viral load ≤500.000 copies/ml (initially ≤100.000, widened 
after 7 months of recruitment) and without any major resistance substitutions in the RT or PI genome, 
were given DTG+ 3TC (the dual regimen) or DTG+ TDF/FTC (triple therapy). The treatment consisted of 
commercial supply of DTG (Tivicay) in combination with over-encapsulated commercial tablet of 3TC 
(Epivir) or TDF/FTC (Truvada). No dose reductions, modifications in dosage, or changes in the frequency 
of dosing were allowed. Patients were stratified for baseline viral load (≤ or > 100.000 copies/mL) and 
baseline CD4 count (≤200 or >200 cells/µL blood).The primary endpoint concerns the proportion of 
patients with HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL at week 48, using the Snap shot approach.The studies are blinded 
(3TC vs TDF/FTC) up to week 96, followed by open label (keeping the randomized treatment arms) up to 
week 144. From week 96 to week 144 the dual regimen will be provided using the fixed dose product.

The results, i.e. similar outcomes for dual and triple therapy, were consistent for the subset of 
patients with a baseline viral load >100.000 copies/mL, by demographic parameters (age, sex, 
race) and by HIV-1 subtype (B vs non-B). In line with previous results yielded with DTG-based 
therapy in previously untreated patients, no resistance development was seen in non-responders 
with either treatment regimen (dual or triple). 
3.3  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For patients with a baseline CD4 count <200 cel/mm3 there is a tendency for a lower response rate with 
the dual regimen, which reached significance in GEMINI-2. However, numbers are low, and when looking 
at details for these “non-responders” it was clarified that non-response was in practice not “virological”, 
but linked to other reasons (mainly stopping therapy for other reasons, with a last viral load <40 
copies/ml). In summary, the dual regimen yielded fully similar efficacy as did the triple regimen, both in 
patients with a high baseline viral load, and in those with a low baseline CD4 count. Outcomes by 
demographic factors were consistent with that of the overall population, i.e. similar between arms. That 
is true also when looking at HIV subtypes, with an overall response rate that was fully similar for those 
infected with non-B subtypes, 93% (231/249) with DTG + 3TC and 95% (217/229) with the control 
regimen, as compared to those infected with subtype B, 91 and 93%, respectively.  Numbers of individual 
non-B subtypes treated (such as subtype C) are, however, limited. The results of the studies are 
considered generalizable across HIV subtypes in an EU setting, where resistance screening and viral load 
monitoring is in place.

3.4  Unfavourable effects 
The clinical phase III program for the dual treatment combination of DTG+3TC included two identical 
studies (GEMINI 1 and 2) where in total 716 subjects were exposed to DTG+3TC and 717 subjects were 
exposed to DTG+TDF/FTC up to Week 48 database freeze. The study will continue blinded up to Week 96, 
followed by Open-label to week 144. The study included treatment naïve, HIV-1 positive subjects. Up to 
week 48, withdrawal occurred in 66 (9%) of the subjects treated with DTG+3TC and in 52 (7%) of the 
subjects treated with DTG+TDF/FTC. 
The safety profile of DTG and 3TC has previously been characterised, both as individual substances and in 
combination with other ARTs and is in general considered favourable. The safety profile of DTG+3TC 
showed a similar frequency of AEs as compared to the treatment regimen with DTG+TDF/FTC (GEMINI 1 
and 2). The most common AEs reported in the GEMINI studies was headache (10%), diarrhoea (9-11%) 
and nasopharyngitis (8-11%) in both treatment groups. Among possibly treatment-related AEs were 
nausea (2-5%), headache (3-4%), insomnia (2-3%) and diarrhoea (2-3%) the most commonly reported 
ones. The frequency of nausea was slightly lower in the DTG+3TC group. Headache was the most 
common drug-related AE Grade 2-5 and occurred in 1% of the subjects in both treatment groups. 
Headache is a previously known AE associated with DTG therapy. 
The incidence of SAE in the DTG+3TC group was low (<1% within each SOC) and similar to the incidence 
in the DTG+TDF/FTC group. Two deaths were reported among the DTG+3TC treated subjects, none of 
these deaths were, however, indicative of causality to therapy. 
Psychiatric symptoms have been reported to occur more frequently in people living with HIV compared 
with the general population. Psychiatric disorders may also be associated with ART. In studies including 
DTG-based treatment the reporting rate of psychiatric disorders has been low. In the GEMINI studies a 
similar frequency of any psychiatric disorder was reported from the two treatment groups, where 
insomnia was most frequently reported. Withdrawals related to psychiatric disorders occurred in <1% of 
the subjects in both treatment groups. Among the possible drug-related AEs within this SOC, insomnia 
was reported in 13 (2%) of the subjects treated with DTG+3TC and in 18 (3%) of the subjects treated 
with DTG+TDF/FTC. These results are in line with previous reports, i.e. insomnia being the most frequent 
common AE during TDG therapy within this SOC.   
TDF is associated with changes in renal function, and the exclusion of TDF could therefore translate to a 
clinical benefit long term. In the GEMINI studies an initial difference in renal improvement was observed 
between the two treatment groups, favouring the dual regimen. However, tabulated data demonstrated 
that the slight the difference in mean GFRs between the dual and triple regimen (regardless whether 
based on creatinine or cystatin C) occurs between baseline and Week 4. From Week 4 and onwards the 
change in GFR values seems to be parallel for the two regimens.  
3.5  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Given that the safety profiles of both DTG and 3TC, also in combination, are well established in the context 
of ART, there are no relevant uncertainties or limitations about the unfavourable effects of DTG/3TC per 
se. The remaining uncertainties mainly concern the extent of the potential relative safety benefits of 
DTG/3TC in comparison to triple ART, which in the control arms of the GEMINI studies contain TDF.

3.7  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
DTG is well tolerated, and no long-term toxicity issues have been identified so far. In prior 
investigator-initiated switch studies it was clarified that DTG as monotherapy carries an unacceptable risk 
for virological failure. However, when adding lamivudine, a well-tolerated NRTI without known safety 
concerns, non-inferiority was met with the dual regimen versus DTG given with 2 NRTIs (TDF/FTC), i.e. 
standard triple therapy, in a representative, previously untreated population. Up to week 48 there are no 
signals for a relevant difference in efficacy with the dual and triple regimen. Of importance, in line with 
prior results with DTG-based therapy, no de novo resistance was seen in patients without virological 
suppression by week 48, neither with the dual or triple regimen.   
Without a prior history of regimens, where the quality of individual agents calls for triple therapy to yield 
optimized efficacy, the results in the GEMINI studies indeed would question the addition of a third agent, 
such as TDF or abacavir to the dual regimen. The use of dual rather than triple therapy will substantially 
reduce the accumulated drug exposure during life-long HIV therapy, where no agents can be considered 
free from side effects, seen daily or potentially after long term treatment. 
3.7.2 Balance of benefits and risks 
The risk with the use of Dovato dual therapy, rather than the use of DTG-based triple therapy, would be 
a reduction in efficacy, and associated resistance development. No relevant difference in efficacy was 
seen, and no cases of de novo resistance have been captured in around 700 patients treated with the dual 
regimen for 48 weeks of study. Available data indicate that this potential risk does not outbalance the 
potential gain of avoiding a third agent in the regimen in a lifelong treatment, seemingly without gaining 
in efficacy and potentially adding to the side effect burden. 
3.7.3 Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Dovato is positive. Week 96 data is expected to be available 2Q 2019. Efficacy 
(including a summary on de novo resistance up to this time point) should be provided as part of a type 2 
Variation. 
4.   Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Dovato is favourable in the following indication: 
Dovato is indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults 
and adolescents above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg, with no known or suspected resistance to 
the integrase inhibitor class, or lamivudine. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Invasive  aspergillosis  is  a  life  threatening  infection  that  is  seen  predominantly  in  immunocompromised 
patients.  Patients  at  greatest  risk  are  those  with  prolonged  neutropenia  related  to  antineoplastic 
chemotherapy  and/or  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (HSCT),  those  receiving  immunosuppressants 
following solid organ transplants, advanced HIV infection and those given high doses of corticosteroids.  
The  transmission  of  fungal  spores  to  the  human  host  is  via  inhalation  and  Aspergillus  primarily  affects  the 
lungs,  causing  4  main  syndromes:  allergic  bronchopulmonary  aspergillosis  (ABPA),  chronic  necrotizing 
Aspergillus  pneumonia  (also  termed  chronic  necrotizing  pulmonary  aspergillosis  [CNPA]),  aspergilloma,  and 
invasive aspergillosis. The majority of human illness is caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger 
and,  less  frequently,  by  Aspergillus  flavus  and  Aspergillus  clavatus.  Aspergillus  may  hematogenously 
disseminate beyond the lungs and the CNS,  cardiovascular system, and other tissues may be infected  as a 
result. 
Invasive aspergillosis is treated with systemic antifungal agents, such as polyenes (Amphotericin B), mould 
active  triazoles  (voriconazole, itraconazole,  posaconazole)  and  echinocandins (caspofungin,  micafungin,  and 
anidulafungin). Certain conditions of invasive aspergillosis warrant consideration for surgical resection of the 
infected focus. Despite the current available antifungal therapies (AFTs) for invasive aspergillosis IFD is still 
associated with high mortality rates (30-40% in treated and 95% in untreated patients).  
Mucormycosis is extremely rare and refers to several different diseases caused by infection with fungi in the 
order of Mucorales. Rhizopus species are the most common causative organisms. Mucoraceae are ubiquitous 
fungi that are commonly found in soil and in decaying matter.  Rhizopus can be found in moldy bread. Most 
humans  are  exposed  to  these  organisms  on  a  daily  or  weekly  basis.  The  major  route  of  infection  is  via 
inhalation  of  conidia;  other  routes  include  ingestion  and  traumatic  inoculation.  They  rarely  cause  disease 
because  of  the  low  virulence  of  the  organisms;  instead,  they  mainly  affect  immunocompromised  patients. 
Patients  with  uncontrolled  diabetes  mellitus,  especially  with  ketoacidosis,  are  at  high  risk.  Patients  with 
cancer—especially those who are neutropenic and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics—as well as individuals 
receiving immunosuppressive agents—including oral or intravenous steroids and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–
alpha  blockers—are  at  risk.  In  addition,  hematologic  cancer  patients  with  opportunistic  herpetic  infections 
(e.g., cytomegalovirus) and graft versus host disease are at increased risk. 
Most mucormycosis infections are  life-threatening. Severe infection of  the  facial  sinuses, which may extend 
into the brain, is the most common presentation. Pulmonary, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal (GI) infections 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 9/162 
 
  
  
are  also  recognized.  Rhinocerebral  disease  causes  significant  morbidity  in  patients  who  survive,  because 
treatment usually requires extensive, and often disfiguring, facial surgery. 
Surviving  mucormycosis  requires  rapid  diagnosis  and  aggressive  coordinated  medical  and  surgical  therapy. 
Successful  mucormycosis  treatment  requires  correction  of  the  underlying  risk  factor(s),  antifungal  therapy 
with liposomal amphotericin B, and aggressive surgery.  
Still  mucormycosis  carries  a  mortality  rate  of  50-85%.  The  mortality  rate  associated  with  rhinocerebral 
disease  is  50-70%.  Pulmonary  and  gastrointestinal  (GI)  diseases  carry  an  even  higher  mortality  rate, 
because  these  forms  are  typically  diagnosed  late  in  the  disease  course.  Disseminated  disease  carries  a 
mortality rate that approaches 100%. Cutaneous disease carries the lowest mortality rate (15%). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Isavuconazonium  sulfate  is  a  water-soluble  triazole  antifungal  agent  and  the  prodrug  of  the  active  moiety 
isavuconazole. Isavuconazole demonstrates a fungicidal effect by blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, a key 
component  of  the  fungal  cell  membrane,  through  the  inhibition  of  cytochrome  P-450  dependent  enzyme 
lanosterol 14 alpha demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. This results in an 
accumulation  of  methylated  sterol  precursors  and  a  depletion  of  ergosterol  within  the  cell  membrane  thus 
weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane.  
The following indications were initially proposed: 
 
 
treatment of invasive aspergillosis in adults 
treatment of mucormycosis in adults 
The posology proposed with the initial submission is: 
Posology 
CRESEMBA can be administered orally or via intravenous infusion. 
CRESEMBA is available as hard capsules and as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Adults 
Loading dose 
Therapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of either intravenous or oral CRESEMBA. 
The recommended loading dose is two capsules or one vial of CRESEMBA after reconstitution and dilution 
(equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole) every 8 hours for the first 48 hours (6 administrations in total). 
Maintenance dose 
The recommended maintenance dose is two capsules or one vial after reconstitution and dilution (equivalent 
to 200 mg of isavuconazole) once daily, starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose. 
Duration of treatment 
Duration of therapy should be based on the nature and severity of the underlying disease, recovery from 
immunosuppression, clinical and mycological response. 
For long term treatment beyond 6 months, the benefit-risk balance should be carefully considered (see SmPC 
sections 5.1 and 5.3). 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 10/162 
 
  
  
On the basis of the high oral bioavailability (98%, see SmPC section 5.2), switching between intravenous and 
oral administration is appropriate when clinically indicated. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of CRESEMBA in children aged below 18 years has not yet been established. No data 
are available. 
Older people 
No dose adjustment is necessary for older patients. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment, including patients with end stage renal 
disease (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and 
B) (see SmPC section 5.2). There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh C). 
Method of administration  
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
CRESEMBA must be reconstituted and then further diluted to a concentration corresponding to approximately 
0.8 mg/ml isavuconazole prior to administration by intravenous infusion over a minimum of 1 hour to reduce 
the risk for infusion related reactions. The infusion must be administered via an infusion set with an in-line 
filter with a microporous membrane pore size of 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm. CRESEMBA must not be given as a bolus 
injection. 
For detailed instructions on the reconstitution and dilution of CRESEMBA before administration, see SmPC 
section 6.6. 
The final agreed indication and dosage for Cresemba are: 
CRESEMBA is indicated in adults for the treatment of 
 
invasive aspergillosis 
  mucormycosis in patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1) 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antifungal agents. 
Posology 
Loading dose 
The recommended loading dose is one vial after reconstitution and dilution (equivalent to 200 mg of 
isavuconazole) every 8 hours for the first 48 hours (6 administrations in total) or alternatively two capsules 
(equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole) every 8 hours for the first 48 hours (6 administrations in total). 
Maintenance dose 
The recommended maintenance dose is one vial after reconstitution and dilution or alternatively two capsules 
(equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole) once daily, starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 11/162 
 
  
  
Duration of therapy should be determined by the clinical response (see SmPC section 5.1).  
For long-term treatment beyond 6 months, the benefit-risk balance should be carefully considered (see SmPC 
sections 5.1 and 5.3). 
Switching between isavuconazole dosage forms 
CRESEMBA is available powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 200 mg isavuconazole, 
equivalent to 372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate and as hard capsules containing 100 mg isavuconazole, 
equivalent to 186 mg isavuconazonium sulfate.  
On the basis of the high oral bioavailability (98%, see SmPC section 5.2), switching between intravenous and 
oral administration is appropriate when clinically indicated. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients; however the clinical experience in elderly patients is 
limited. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment, including patients with end-stage renal 
disease (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Classes A 
and B) (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
CRESEMBA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Use in 
these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the risks. See 
SmPC sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of CRESEMBA in children aged below 18 years has not yet been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration  
Intravenous use 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
CRESEMBA must be reconstituted and then further diluted to a concentration corresponding to approximately 
0.8 mg/mL isavuconazole prior to administration by intravenous infusion over a minimum of 1 hour to reduce 
the risk of infusion-related reactions. The infusion must be administered via an infusion set with an in-line 
filter with a microporous membrane made of polyethersulfone (PES) and with a pore size of 0.2 μm to 
1.2 μm. CRESEMBA must only be given as an intravenous infusion. 
For detailed instructions on the reconstitution and dilution of CRESEMBA before administration, see SmPC

General information 
The active substance is isavuconazonium sulfate, a highly water soluble pro-drug of the active triazole 
isavuconazole. 
The chemical name of the active substance isavuconazonium sulfate is 1-{(2R,3R)-3-[4-(4-cyanophenyl)-1,3-
thiazol-2-yl]-2-(2,5-difluoro-phenyl)-2-hydroxybutyl}-4-[(1RS)-1-({methyl[3-({[(methylamino)acetyl] 
oxy}methyl) pyridin-2-yl]carbamoyl}oxy)ethyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazol-4-ium monosulfate (IUPAC), corresponding 
to the molecular formula C35H35F2N8O5S·HSO4 and has a relative molecular mass of 814.84 g/mol. The 
relative molecular mass of isavuconazole is 437.47. The active substance has the following structure:

Figure 1: Structure of isavuconazonium sulfate 
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, UV, IR, 
1H-, 13C- and 19F-NMR spectrometry, and single crystal X-ray analysis, all of which support the chemical 
structure. 
It appears as a white, amorphous, hygroscopic powder. It is very soluble in water and over the pH range 1-7. 
It is also very soluble in methanol and sparingly soluble in ethanol. Two pKa values have been found and 
calculated to be 2.0 and 7.3. Its logPoct/wat calculated by software is 1.31. 
Isavuconazonium sulfate has three chiral centres. The stereochemistry of the active substance is introduced 
by one of the starting materials which is controlled by appropriate specification.  The two centres, C7 and C8 
in the isavuconazole moiety and in an intermediate of the active substance, have R configuration. The third 
chiral centre, C29, is not located on isavuconazole moiety and has both the R and S configurations. The non-
defined stereo centre at C29 has been found in all batches produced so far to be racemic. Erosion of 
stereochemical purity has not been observed in the current process. The active substance is a mixture of two 
epimers of C29. An enantiomer of drug substance was identified as  C7 (S), C8 (S) and C29 (R/S) structure. 
The control of the stereochemistry of isavuconazonium sulfate is performed by chiral HPLC on the active 
substance and its two precursors.  
Subsequent intermediates are also controlled by relevant specification in the corresponding steps.  
Two crystal forms have been observed by recrystallisation studies.  However the manufacturing process as 
described yields amorphous form only. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls  
Isavuconazonium sulfate is manufactured in 10 converging synthetic steps from 5 regulatory starting 
materials. The different steps are performed by two different manufacturing sites. The currently proposed 
starting materials are simple molecules, which contribute significant structural fragments to the final active 
substance, are commercially available and are acceptable in line with ICH Q11 and current European 
regulatory practice. The synthetic schemes and specification for each one of the five starting materials have 
also been presented. Several intermediates are produced and isolated in the commercial manufacturing 
process. These intermediates are sufficiently controlled to assure the quality of active substance. The 
synthetic route involves some re-processing, which does not introduce any new solvents or reagents. It has 
been adequately described and is thus acceptable. The process, raw materials, reagents, and equipment used 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 14/162 
 
  
  
 
 
were adequately described and the manufacturing process parameters, proven acceptable ranges and normal 
acceptable ranges were justified.  
Two different salt forms of isavuconazonuium (chloride and sulfate) were identified during development. The 
sulfate salt was selected for further development. A polymorph screening study was also performed. None of 
the investigated salts could be obtained in crystalline form. 
The active substance manufacturing process was developed using QbD elements such as Failure Mode and 
Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Design of Experiments (DoE) Study and Design Space to identify the critical 
processing steps and parameters that have an impact on critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the substance 
and to define proven acceptable ranges (PAR) and normal operating ranges (NOR) for the process.  Additional 
risk assessment (FMEA) was also performed following identification of critical process parameters (CPPs), 
taking into account historical batch data, equipment capabilities and operational control to establish the final 
CPPs ranges. However no design spaces have been claimed by the applicant in the manufacturing process of 
the active substance. The in-process controls (IPCs) applied for the 10 steps were presented. The 
manufacturing process will be validated using three consecutive commercial scale batches prior to 
commercialisation. 
The origin and fate or impurities, including those which are potentially genotoxic was evaluated. Many of the 
potential compounds discussed are purely theoretical compounds. However all identified and also theoretical 
compounds were considered. Two potential genotoxic impurities (GTI) have been specified GTI1 and 
GTI2.The first is a process-related impurity that tested positive in the Ames test and is controlled as an IPC. 
The second one is a secondary degradantandis controlled in the final active substance specification.  
None of the specified related substances in the active substance originate from the starting materials. None 
of the related substances or other impurities contained in the intermediates defined in the process carries 
over to the final active substance. Adequate controls for all residual solvents have been included at the 
appropriate steps of active substance manufacture.  No catalysts are used. 
The active substance is packed in polyethylene sleeve, or polyethylene powder transfer bags, with desiccant, 
inside a sealed aluminium laminated water impermeable bags placed inside rigid containers.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for: appearance (visual inspection), 
appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, HPLC), enantiomer (HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), genotoxic impurities (HPLC/MS, HPLC), sulfate anion (ion chromatography), 
residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and 
microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). The sum of maximum observed value in active substance of the (potential) 
genotoxic impurities is considered acceptable, since this calculated intake is below the acceptable daily intake 
of 60 µg total impurities based on the maintenance dose of 200 mg/day isavuconazole.  
For GTI 1 the proposed limit would lead to a daily intake of 37μg of this impurity. This intake exceeds the 
allowable intake of 1.5 µg per day for genotoxic impurities (EMA/CHMP/SWP/431994/2007 Rev. 3). However 
this is not a concern, because this impurity is rapidly degraded in plasma- half-time of < 2 min- and, as such, 
GTI 1 poses a negligible genotoxic risk. The proposed limit has been toxicologically qualified. For GTI 2 higher 
limit than the TTC is also justified, since human exposure to this impurity is greater from other natural 
sources (e.g. atmosphere, food, even produced endogenously). On the same basis as well as on batch 
results, it has been justified not to include a specification limit for acetaldehyde. 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015

The proposed active substance specification and limits has been satisfactorily justified. The analytical 
methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Full details of the reference standards used were provided. 
Batch analysis data on three consecutive commercial scale validation batches were provided. Supportive data 
from laboratory and development smaller scale batches use during the product development program were 
also provided. The submitted batch analysis data confirm that the manufacture is sufficiently robust and 
provide reassurance that the process yields active substance of consistent quality, complying with the 
specification.  
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial packaging 
for up to 36 months under long term conditions at -20±5°C and for up to 24 months under accelerated 
conditions at 5±3°C according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches were analysed for 
description, identification, pH, appearance of solution, related substances, GTI 2, enantiomer, C-29 epimer 
ratio, anion (sulfate), water content, microbial limits, assay and specific optical rotation using the analytical 
procedures proposed for release testing. All batches were compliant with the specifications at all time points 
and no significant trends were observed.  
In addition supportive stability data for another two pilot and four commercial scale batches under long term 
conditions at -20±5°C for up to 36 months were presented. One of these batches was packaged in a different 
material that the one intended for commercial use. The active substance showed no significant change or 
trend in any of the parameters monitored. Further supportive stability data for another three pilot and four 
commercial scale batches at 5±3°C for up to 24 months were presented. The container closure system used 
for these batches is the same as the commercial container. A slight increase in amounts of some impurities 
has been observed under the storage condition at 5 ± 3 °C for all of the seven batches, however, all results 
of the quality attributes tested complied with the corresponding acceptance criteria in the specification. 
Forced degradation studies were conducted in the solid state and in solution using 3 batches (one laboratory, 
one pilot and one commercial scale) placed on stability in high temperature (60oC, 7days, commercial 
packaging), high humidity (51%RH, 7 days) and light (ICH Q1B compliant) stress conditions. Forced 
degradation studies of the drug substance, prepared as aqueous solutions was conducted in acidic, oxidative 
and basic stress conditions. The batches were analysed for related substances, degradation, assay, peak 
purity, and mass balance. Degradation was observed in high heat, high humidity, acidic and basic conditions, 
and no degradation observed in light or oxidative stress conditions. The analytical methods used for stability 
studies were consistent with those proposed for release testing with the exception of methods for turbidity 
and completeness of solution (Ph. Eur. 2.2.1), colour of solution (Ph. Eur. 2.2.2), C29 epimer ratio (HPLC), 
and assay (HPLC). All methods were well described and were considered acceptable. The results from the 
forced degradation studies show that the method on related substances is sufficiently stability indicating. 
In conclusion, the proposed re-test period of 24 months, when stored in polyethylene bags packed in heat 
sealed aluminium laminated bags at -20oC is adequately supported by the stability data provided and is 
acceptable.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Cresemba has been developed as a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion for i.v. use and as hard 
capsules for oral use. The active substance is isavuconazonium sulfate, a highly water soluble pro-drug of the 
active triazole isavuconazole. The specific prodrug moiety was chosen based on preclinical data on fast and 
complete conversion rates by enzymatic cleavage to the active moiety. The focus was the increase of the 
aqueous solubility to enhance and enable the parenteral application by infusion, and also the oral 
bioavailability with low inter-subject variability and well controlled linear pharmacokinetics.  
Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to manufacture a stable freeze dried powder for solution for 
infusion.  
Isavuconazonium sulfate is manufactured as an amorphous material. It has been demonstrated that the 
amorphous form is consistently maintained throughout finished product manufacture, and that the 
lyophilisation process does not influence the polymorphic form. The key physicochemical property of the 
active substance that influences the quality of the product is sensitivity to hydrolytic degradation by moisture 
and temperature.  Therefore the objective of the pharmaceutical development was to protect the prodrug 
from hydrolysis caused by moisture, temperature and pH. In the initial phases of formulation development 
the chloride salt of isavuconazonium was used, which was later replaced by the sulfate salt.The choice of the 
salt of the active substance has been justified. 
Different bulking agent systems and buffering systems were tried before mannitol and sulphuric acid were 
selected as a bulking agent and for pH adjustment, respectively. The choice of excipients has been justified. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Compatibility of these excipients 
with the drug substance has been demonstrated through stability studies. 
Conventional terminal sterilisation by heat in the final container was not possible because isavuconazonium 
sulfate is sensitive to hydrolysis in solid state and in solution. To produce a sterile product in dry state, 
lyophilisation which is a common and effective manufacturing method was selected. Sterility of the product is 
assured by sterile filtration of the bulk solution and aseptic processing.  The sterile filtration process utilizes 
standard procedures and equipment for a lyophilized product manufactured by aseptic process. The 
manufacturing process has not been changed significantly throughout the development. The stability of the 
bulk solution was evaluated and the bulk holding time from the addition of isavuconazonium sulfate into the 
formulation vessel to the start of lyophilisation cycle was established. 
The lyophilisation cycle parameters have been optimised over the course of development to reduce the 
residual moisture in the lyophilized cake as low as practically possible because the residual moisture is the 
cause of degradation of the isavuconazonium sulfate to isavuconazole. The freeze drying process was 
optimised by thermal characterisation studies in order to ensure the reliable and reproducible formation of a 
solid freeze-dried cake.

In addition, to ensure the withdrawal of the labelled amount of drug product from the vials, a 6% overfill is 
applied during vial filling.Isavuconazonium sulfate powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is 
reconstituted in 5 ml sterile water for injection. The reconstituted solution is further diluted into 250 ml of 
0.9% sodium chloride infusion solution (saline) or 5 % glucose infusion solution (D5W).  
The re-constitution time of the finished product was investigated and data from 10 batches were presented  
The reconstitution time is found to be appropriate for an intravenous product. 
The infusion solution is administered through an inline filter placed between the infusion bag and patient 
access. In the clinical setting, the reconstituted solution may be stored for up to one hour prior to preparation 
of the infusion solution. The infusion solution must be stored refrigerated at 2°C - 8°C, and the patient 
infusion must be completed within 24 hours after reconstitution of the lyophilized powder. 
The stability of the administration solution in 250 ml saline and D5W was evaluated to confirm compatibility 
with these infusion solutions. A white precipitate formed during preparation of the administration solution 
when the reconstituted solution was mixed with saline or D5W. This precipitate was observed throughout the 
compatibility study and the assay and impurity values were consistent.  
Theoretically the formation of the precipitate could pose a risk of systemic arterial embolism from intravenous 
administration; therefore the issue was raised as a major objection. The precipitate has been identified as the 
active moiety isavuconazole. A detailed discussion has been provided on the issue of potential formation of 
the precipitate, the risks of omission of in-line filtration, presentation of precaution measures to limit the 
formation of this precipitate, and test data on available in-line filters suitable to be used with the product. 
Concrete data related to the particle formation as well as quantitative aspects of these particle formation 
were provided together with solubility data for isavuconazole (both as sulfate as well as free base) in various 
media and conditions. The amount and density of the particles in the infusion solution are too low to be 
quantifiable. Herewith it can be concluded, that potential loss of this small amount of isavuconazole 
precipitate on the filter does not have any impact on the assay contents of the infusion solution. 
On the other hand it has been shown that isavuconazole particles readily dissolve in human plasma by 
strongly binding to proteins. This strong plasma-protein binding promotes a rapid dissolution of the 
precipitate in human plasma.  
In addition the dissolution experiments that have been performed represent most likely a ‘worst-case 
scenario’ when compared to the actual loose agglomerated particles that are formed in situ in the infusion 
bag. It was estimated that the hydrated agglomerates isavuconazole formed in the infusion solution will not 
exceed 1 mg and will be dissolved in human plasma within few seconds. 
Despite several experiments the precise mechanism of the formation of particles could not be identified, 
although data suggest that the equilibrium of the system is stable under normal in-use conditions. Also the 
exact reason of increased formation of particles due to vigorous mixing or shaking could not be definitely 
explained. It is possibly attributed to the formation of additional seed nuclei, as well as generation of very 
small air bubbles, thus affecting the equilibrium between dissolved and undissolved isavuconazole.  
Based on the information presented it can be concluded that the potential formation of isavuconazole 
particles in the infusion solution does not have an impact on the safety or efficacy of the product. The 
warning in the SmPC (section 6.6) against unnecessary vibration or vigorous shaking, and the recommended 
method of administration (section 4.2), requiring in-line filtration with a microporous membrane prior to 
administration, are considered justified and appropriate measures to mitigate any risk from the possible 
formation of isavuconazole particles in the infusion solution with regard to the safety or efficacy of the 
product.

The primary packaging is 10 ml Type I glass vial with rubber stopper and an aluminum cap with plastic seal. 
The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process includes eight steps: weighing, compounding, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, 
lyophilisation, capping, inspection, and packaging. The aseptic production of isavuconazonium sulfate powder 
for concentrate for solution for infusion is described and the commercial batch size has been defined. 
Weighing and compounding are performed in a Grade C area. Sterile filtration, the aseptic filling and 
lyophilisation are performed in a Grade A area. Capping is performed under Grade A air supply with Grade C 
background. All processes are carried out using equipment and facilities that have been appropriately 
qualified and validated. The critical steps in the final drug product manufacturing process were identified as 
pH adjustment during compounding, sterile filtration and aseptic filling and sufficient in process controls are 
in place. In line with the guideline on process validation (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1), 
the aseptic processing and lyophilisation are considered to be non-standard manufacturing processes. 
Therefore the process has been validated using 3 consecutive commercial scale batches and one additional 
commercial scale validation batch manufactured later. The process has been also validated using a media fill 
study and showed that the sterile integrity of the process was maintained throughout. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specification includes appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
description (visual), identification (HPLC, HPLC-PDA), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC), isavuconazole (HPLC), GTI 2 (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
particulate contamination visible particles (Ph. Eur.), particulate contamination sub-visible particles (Ph. 
Eur.), reconstitution time, bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). The proposed limits for 
related substances were justified on the basis of ICH Q6A and ICH Q3B (R2). The limit for  GTI 2has been 
thoroughly justified and is in accordance with ICH M7 Draft Guidance, in that the 120 μg/day maximum is not 
exceeded for isavuconazonium iv product because the duration of administration is projected to be less than 
30 days. Extractable volume has been accepted to be omitted from the proposed specification on the basis of 
the 6% overfill. Isavuconazole is the active moiety of the drug substance and is, therefore, considered 
qualified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. The same reference standards used for the active substance analyses are used for the iv 
drug product. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 registration batches / primary stability batches and 5 process 
validation batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to 
the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three consecutive commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term 
conditions for 24 months at 5 ºC and for 6 months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 19/162 
 
  
  
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Supportive stability data were provided 
for a further two commercial scale batches of the proposed product. The batches were placed on stability in 
long term (5 ºC) for up to 33 months and accelerated conditions (25 ºC) for 6 months. Samples were tested 
for: description, reconstitution time, pH, visible particles, sub-visible particles, related substances, 
isavuconazole, GTI 2, water, assay, bacterial endotoxins and sterility. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating.  All batches showed good compliance with the specification limits and meet the 
specification when stored at 5oC. No significant trends were observed under long term conditions.  
In accelerated conditions, a decrease in assay and increase in impurities, including GTI 2 was observed. 
Whilst the data are within the specification limits proposed, the storage conditions of the finished product 
should be restricted to 5oC (studied long term conditions). 
In-use stability data of reconstituted solution were provided for one commercial scale batch, selected from 
initial release, and following storage at 5 oC for 12 months, reconstituted with 5 ml WFI then diluted with 
250 ml 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution, and placed on stability for up to 24 hours in long term (5 oC) and 
6 hours in ambient conditions. No significant differences were observed in the diluted solutions made with 
fresh, and 12 month old finished product samples.  As such, the changes during the in-use storage period of 
the reconstituted solution observed are considered acceptable. 
In-use stability data of the diluted solution, prepared from initial and 12 months storage sample, were 
provided for the same batch which was analysed pre- and post- in line filtration immediately following dilution 
in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose, and following 6 hours storage at ambient conditions, or 24 hours at 5 oC. The 
data show the filter is effective in reducing the sub-visible particulate counts, and that assay is unaffected.  
No significant differences were observed between the diluents however an increase in isavuconazole 
particulate formation was observed in batches of the lyophilisate diluted following storage (12 months at 5oC) 
and particulates were higher in samples diluted with saline, than those diluted with dextrose. However based 
on the information presented regarding the precipitate formation the differences observed are not expected 
to have any impact on the safety or efficacy of the product when used in accordance with the 
recommendations of the SmPC.  
Forced degradation studies were conducted with one commercial scale batch of the finished product, placed 
on stability under heat and humidity (40oC, 75%RH, 2 months), and humidity (25oC/75%RH, 2 months) 
stress conditions. The forced degradation data provided indicate the product is sensitive to high heat, and has 
some sensitivity to moisture. The storage instructions in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) specify that the 
storage temperature should be restricted for this product (2-8 °C). 
A photostability study was conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B guideline. All the data met the acceptance 
criteria indicating that the product is photostable. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 months at 2 to 8 °C, as stated in the SmPC is 
acceptable. The in-use stability shelf life of 24 hours at 2 to 8 °C, or 6 hours at room temperature for the 
reconstituted and diluted solution as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin are used in the manufacture of Cresemba powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion.

Hard capsules 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Cresemba 100 mg hard capsules contain 100 mg isavuconazole as active substance corresponding to 
186.3 mg isavuconazonium sulfate. Isavuconazonium sulfate is a pro-drug of the active moiety 
isavuconazole. 
The primary objective of development was to produce a capsule of an acceptable size, accommodating the 
minimum possible number of capsules per dose, and a manufacturing process that is robust and reliable. A 
traditional approach, with some enhanced approach tools (e.g. risk assessment, design of experiments) was 
used for the development of the formulations and manufacturing processes. The quality target product 
prolfile (QTPP) was defined as an oral immediate release capsule, containing 100 mg of the active moiety. It 
should meet specification limits for description, dissolution, assay, uniformity of dosage units, related 
substances and GTI 2, and it should be stable for at least 2 years at 25 oC. The product should be packaged 
in a container closure system that will provide adequate protection from moisture, protection throughout 
distribution and use, as well as convenience of use for the patients. From the defined QTPP, the finished 
product critical quality attributes (CQAs) were identified as dissolution, description, assay, uniformity of 
dosage units, and related substances.  
The initial formulation development used the chloride salt. The salt form of isavuconazonium was changed 
from chloride to sulfateduring developmentThe choice of the salt of the active substance has been justified. 
Isavuconazonium sulfate is an amorphous material. Its solubility is >1.0 g/ml in any of the pH conditions 
tested (pH 1, 3, 5 and 7) and it is a BCS class I substance. The active moiety (isavuconazole) is poorly water-
soluble but is highly permeable; the mean absolute bioavailability of isavuconazole after a single oral dose of 
isavuconazonium sulfate hard capsules (equivalent to 400 mg isavuconazole) was 98%, demonstrating 
complete absorption. The capsule manufacturing uses a standard dry granulation process. The particle size 
distribution (PSD) of isavuconazonium sulfate is not regarded as a critical quality attribute since the drug 
substance is highly soluble.  
The initial formulation was further optimised to improve the physical properties of the blend. As 
isavuconazonium sulfate is a moisture-sensitive substance, a desiccant, anhydrous magnesium citrate, has 
been selected as a component to prevent degradation of the isavuconazonium sulfate due to hydrolysis. 
Magnesium citrate is normally used as drug substance for the treatment of constipation and there is no 
excipient monograph but a Ph. Eur. drug substance monograph is available. When used as a laxative, a dose 
of 11-25 g is required for therapeutic effect, whereas when used as magnesium dietary supplement, it is 
given in a dose of approximately 2 g daily (Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference). These doses are 
much higher than the anticipated exposure to magnesium from the isavuconazonium sulfate capsule 
Therefore magnesium citrate is a well-described chemical entity and its use of as an excipient at the levels 
proposed is considered justified. All of the other excipients selected are widely used for pharmaceutical 
products and are regarded as being safe for human use. Also with respect to isavuconazonium sulfate 
sensitivity to moisture, HPMC capsules are used.  The choice of HPMC over hard gelatin capsules has been 
justified.The compatibility of drug substance with excipients was investigated using binary mixtures. 
The proposed commercial formulation is the same as the formulation that has been used in Phase III clinical 
studies except from the capsule shells colour and imprint. 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015

A detailed and satisfactory discussion on selection and optimisation of the dissolution media and test 
conditions has been provided. Isavuconazonium sulfate is a highly water soluble drug. The development of 
the dissolution method has been described and the choice of dissolution conditions has been justified. 
Considering the presented data and given that the capsule shell dissolution is the main rate limiting step, the 
method used for dissolution is considered to be discriminatory enough to identify differences in rate of 
dissolution. 
The dissolution profiles of 16 clinical batches including and 3 registration batches were compared. 
The batch which showed the slowest dissolution profile among the historical batches tested, demonstrated 
the high oral bioavailability in the absolute bioavailability study against the i.v. formulation. It should also be 
noted that no substantial differences in tmax, Cmax and AUC of isavuconazole were observed across the 
different capsule variants including formulation, manufacturing process, type of capsule shell 
(gelatin/hypromellose), and salt of isavuconazonium (chloride/sulfate). In addition, similar pharmacokinetic 
parameters including tmax, Cmax and AUC were observed with isavuconazonium sulfate oral solution (14C-
labeled isavuconazonium sulfate used in a mass balance study) and the isavuconazonium sulfate hard 
capsules (used in single dose pharmacokinetic studies). These observations suggest the dissolution behaviour 
of isavuconazonium sulfate hard capsules tested is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetic parameters. Based 
on the above, the interchangeability between isavuconazonium capsules and i.v. drug product is proposed. 
The criticality of each step of the manufacturing process was evaluated. A risk analysis based on 
manufacturing experience was performed to systematically identify the processing parameters and their 
interrelations impacting quality attributes of the finished product. Based on the outcome of the analysis, the 
influence of blending time and the compaction process parameters were further optimised. All potentially 
impacting attributes or parameters were evaluated and no critical steps were identified.  
The same manufacturing process has been used throughout clinical development with only minor 
modifications. 
The bulk capsules are packaged in polyethylene bags, placed with a desiccant inside an aluminium pouch and 
packaged in an outer carton. The specifications and acceptance criteria for the packaging materials have 
been provided as well as representative certificates of analysis. 
The primary packaging of the finished product is Alu/Alu blisters with each capsule pocket connected to a 
pocket with desiccant. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The container closure 
system is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process comprises 7 steps: Pre-blending I and II, blending of pre-blend I 
and II, roller compacting, final blending, encapsulation and packaging using conventional and well-
established pharmaceutical production equipment and conventional unit operations. No critical steps were 
identified in the drug product manufacturing process however in process controls are proposed to ensure 
uniformity of the dosage form and tightness of the blister.   
The manufacturing process has been validated at the proposed manufacturing site prior to commercialisation 
with three consecutive commercial batches. A satisfactory validation report was provided.

Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specification includes tests and limits for: appearance (visual), 
identification (HPLC, HPLC-PDA), assay (HPLC), isavuconazole (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 
GTI 2 (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.) and 
microbial limits (Ph. Eur).  The proposed finished product specifications have been justified on the basis of 
batch analysis and stability data, capability of the manufacturing process, Ph. Eur. monograph and ICH 
guidelines. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. The same reference standards used for the active substance analyses are used for the 
hard capsules product. 
Batch analysis data for three commercial scale batches were presented and all batches meet the 
specification. Supportive batch analysis data were provided for 7 pilot scale batches of the finished product 
used in Phase I and II clinical trials. In addition batch analysis data for 16 pilot scale batches used in Phase 
III clinical trials were provided. Some of the supportive batches were manufactured at the development 
facility but the majority was manufactured at the commercial site. Testing was conducted according to the 
methods in place at the time of release. All the batches met the specification in place at that time or the 
occurred deviations were assessed and accepted. The presented information confirms the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of the finished product stored under long term conditions for 
up to 18 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The batches were analysed 
according to the proposed shelf life specifications for description, assay, related substances, isavuconazole, 
GTI 2, dissolution, water content and microbial limit. The stability results of the primary stability batches met 
the set specifications, both at long-term and accelerated conditions. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. 
A photostability study was conducted on one commercial scale batch in accordance with ICH Q1B guideline. 
No significant difference was observed except the water content and the attributes sensitive to moisture but 
all the results met the acceptance criteria after the light exposure.  
Forced degradation studies were conducted with one commercial scale batch of the finished product, placed 
on stability under heat (50 oC, 1 month) and high humidity (open blister, 25 oC / 75% RH, 7 days). The 
samples were evaluated for description, assay, related substances, isavuconazole, GTI 2, dissolution and 
water. Degradation was observed under all conditions. An instruction to store in the original packaging in 
order to protect from moisture has been included in the SmPC.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 30 months if stored in aluminium blister without specific 
storage temperature, as stated in the SmP (section 6.3) are acceptable. The product should be stored in the 
original packaging in order to protect from moisture (SmPC section 6.4).

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance is isavuconazonium sulfate, a highly water soluble pro-drug of the active triazole 
isavuconazole. The prodrug of isavuconazole was selected because of its increased solubility, and PK 
characteristics. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The finished product is presented in two pharmaceutical forms: powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion and hard capsules. The formulation and manufacturing process development for both pharmaceutical 
forms has been described in sufficient detail. The proposed specifications and the overall control strategy are 
considered acceptable. It has been demonstrated by appropriate in vitro and in vivo data that capsules and 
powder for concentrate for solution for infusion may be used interchangeably. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Cresemba powder for concentrate for solution for infusion and Cresemba hard capsules is 
considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. 
Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been 
investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In the nonclinical program, the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of isavuconazonium 
sulfate have been extensively characterized. The safety of isavuconazonium sulfate in animals has been 
evaluated by the oral or by the intravenous route. All pivotal toxicity studies were performed in compliance 
with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). Most of the early dose-range finding or pilot studies 
were performed as non-GLP studies, but in GLP-accredited laboratories and according to their standards. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Isavuconazonium sulfate is a water soluble prodrug of the antifungal triazole, isavuconazole. Following oral or 
intravenous administration of isavuconazonium sulfate, the prodrug is rapidly cleaved by plasma esterases 
into the active moiety, isavuconazole, and an inactive cleavage product (BAL8728).

Isavuconazole exhibits broad-spectrum in vitro antifungal activity, including that against Aspergillus spp., 
several species of Mucorales, and Candida spp, as well as against a broad range of rare, but important 
pathogenic fungi. This in vitro activity is not markedly affected by the existing triazole resistance 
mechanisms, which translates into a comparable or superior efficacy in animal models of infection. 
Isavuconazole also shows activity against voriconazole-resistant Mucorales and fluconazole-resistant Candida 
spp., however it is generally not active against voriconazole-resistant Aspergillus spp. Isavuconazole does 
appear to retain activity against some itraconazole-resistant and posaconazole-resistant Aspergillus spp. both 
in vitro and in vivo. 
Primary pharmacodynamics  
A substantial amount of in vitro data has been submitted by the applicant. Most of the MIC data were 
determined using the CLSI methodology. 
An in vitro selection experiment was performed with Aspergillus fumigatus, in which isavuconazole-resistant 
mutants were found, which were cross-resistant to other azoles. The mechanism of resistance is unknown, 
but it seems plausible that mechanisms of resistance for isavuconazole are similar to other azoles.  
Mechanisms of resistance of Mucorales are largely unknown, but data published in the literature suggest that 
the presence of multiple copies of genes involved in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway may play a role, 
thus providing a genetic flexibility to adapt to hostile environments. 
Overall the MIC90 of isavuconazole against Aspergillus spp. was 2 mg/L. The activity of isavuconazole was 
also shown against a wide range of uncommon Aspergillus species. In vitro data determined by using the 
CLSI methodology showed that activity of isavuconazole against Aspergillus spp. was comparable to that of 
itraconazole, voriconazole and caspofungin. Isavuconazole was less active than posaconazole, micafungin and 
anidulafungin and more active than amphotericin B and flucytosine. In vitro data generated by using the 
EUCAST method also indicated that the activity of isavuconazole against Aspergillus species was comparable 
to voriconazole and that isavuconazole is less active against Aspergillus species than posaconazole and more 
active than amphotericin B. However, in this dataset, isavuconazole was less active than itraconazole. The in 
vitro activity of isavuconazole and of comparators was investigated against CYP51A mutants with elevated 
MIC to at least one triazole. Increased MIC values were found for isavuconazole against mutants with 
mutations at L98, M220, G138, Y431, G434 and G448, but not for G54 mutations. In most cases, the activity 
of isavuconazole against these mutants was roughly comparable to that of voriconazole. The mutation L98 
had a larger impact on isavuconazole MIC than on voriconazole MIC. 
The MIC values against Mucorales genera were considerably higher than those against Aspergillus spp 
(MIC90 for Lichtheimia spp. 8 mg/L, Cunninghamella spp. 32 mg/L, Mucor spp. 16 mg/L, Rhizomucor spp 4 
mg/L and Rhizopus 8 mg/L). Isavuconazole was less active than itraconazole (except for Rhizopus spp. 
against which activity was comparable), posaconazole and amphotericin B against Mucorales. 
The MIC90 of isavuconazole against Candida spp. was 0.5 mg/L, with the highest activity against C. albicans 
(MIC90 0.03 mg/L), C. parapsilosis (MIC90 0.06 mg/L) and C. tropicalis (MIC90 0.06 mg/L) and slightly 
lower activity against C. krusei (MIC90 0.5 mg/L), C. glabrata (MIC90 2 mg/L), and C. guilliermondii (MIC90 
1 mg/L). Overall, the in vitro activity of isavuconazole against Candida was approximately comparable to that 
of other azoles. Against fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates, the MICs of isavuconazole were increased 
compared to those of voriconazole and posaconazole. MICs of isavuconazole were increased by the 
expression of CDR multidrug efflux transporter genes and by mutations in ERG11, as were MICs of other 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 25/162 
 
  
  
azoles. MICs of isavuconazole were not affected by MDR1 or FLU1 transporters. Overall, the activity of 
isavuconazole against fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates was comparable to that of other azoles. 
For Cryptococcus spp, no MIC data determined by the EUCAST methodology were available. Based on data 
obtained using the CLSI methodology, the MIC90 of isavuconazole against Cryptococcus spp was 0.06 – 0.12 
mg/L (comparable to that of itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole). 
Isavuconazole was active against various other moulds and yeasts in vitro (data obtained using the CLSI 
methodology). Fusarium spp and Scedosporium spp were not susceptible (MIC90 was 32 mg/L). 
Oral isavuconazole was effective against A. fumigatus and A. flavus in several systemic and pulmonary 
aspergillosis in vivo mouse models. Isavuconazole was not active in one pulmonary mouse model in which 
isavuconazonium was administered subcutaneously, most likely because isavuconazonium is not tolerated 
when administered subcutaneously. Isavuconazole was not effective in guinea pigs, which could be explained 
either by a too low systemic exposure or by the occurrence of acute toxicity. 
In neutropenic mice infected intravenously with A. flavus, the tissue burden after 3 days of treatment starting 
24 h post-infection was comparable following treatment with 15 or 30 mg/kg/day oral isavuconazole or 25 
mg/kg/day oral voriconazole (with grapefruit to increase exposure). Also survival and clearance of organs 
after 10 days of treatment starting 4 or 24 h post-infection was comparable for 15 or 30 mg/kg/day oral 
isavuconazole or 25 mg/kg/day oral voriconazole. 
In a neutropenic rabbit pulmonary infection model (inoculated endotracheally with A. fumigatus), oral 
treatment for 12 days started post-infection with 40 and 60 mg/kg/day isavuconazole equivalents was 
superior to oral voriconazole at 30 mg/kg/day with respect to reduction in pulmonary fungal burden and 
pulmonary injury. 
In an immunocompetent murine model of disseminated aspergillosis, after infection with one wild-type isolate 
or one of 3 mutants of A. fumigatus, G54W, M220I and TR34/L98H followed by 14 days oral 
isavuconazonium, 100% survival was achieved with 30.7 and 61.4 mg/kg/day and 122.9 mg/kg BID 
isavuconazole equivalents in mice infected with the wild-type isolate, with G54W mutants and with M220I 
mutants; 100% survival was not achieved in mice infected with TR34/L98H mutants. 
In a neutropenic mice pulmonary infection model, mice were inoculated with A. fumigatus (4 wild-type 
isolates and 6 mutants with MIC 0.125 – 8 mg/L). The reduction in log10 conidial equivalents per ml lung 
homogenate following treatment with oral isavuconazonium correlated with AUC/MIC (R2 = 0.75). Stasis was 
achieved in all isolates with MIC ≤ 1 mg/L and 1log10 kill was achieved in all isolates with MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L. 
AUCtotaldrug/MIC associated with stasis was 361 – 1111 and associated with 1log10 kill 657 – 1242.  
Isavuconazole was active against Rhizopus oryzae in a pulmonary infection model in neutropenic mice but not 
in diabetic ketoacidotic mice. Oral treatment with 116 mg/kg TID isavuconazole equivalents for 4-5 days was 
comparable to liposomal amphotericin B at 15 mg/kg/day i.v. with respect to survival and reduction of fungal 
load in lungs and brain. 
Isavuconazole at 1.5 – 36 mg/kg (subcutaneous, single dose) significantly reduced the kidney burden of C. 
albicans in neutropenic mice. Isavuconazole at 15 – 120 mg/kg/day (oral) was effective against C. tropicalis 
in a neutropenic mice kidney burden model. Isavuconazole at 30 – 120 mg/kg/day (oral) reduced the kidney 
and brain burden of C. krusei in neutropenic mice.  
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 26/162 
 
  
  
In a neutropenic mouse model of disseminated candidiasis involving isolates of C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. 
tropicalis, AUC/MIC correlated best with kidney burden reduction. AUC/MIC for treatment of C. tropicalis and 
C. glabrata was approximately 10 times lower than for C. albicans. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In an in vitro interaction study, isavuconazole in combination with amphotericin B was antagonistic against 
the investigated Aspergillus isolates in one of two applied methods and therefore this does not seem to be a 
suitable combination against Aspergillus, based on this in vitro study. Isavuconazole in combination with 
micafungin was synergistic against the investigated Aspergillus isolates. Micafungin alone was not active 
against Aspergillus. The combination of isavuconazole and amphotericin B was antagonistic against R. 
microsporus. 
Conclusion on pharmacodynamics  
Most in vitro data were determined using the CLSI methodology. For Mucorales, almost no in vitro data 
determined by EUCAST methodology were provided in the initial submission, MIC values against Mucorales 
were considerably higher than against Aspergillus spp, which could pose a problem for the treatment of 
patients. Some additional data were provided by the applicant, which were obtained by comparing EUCAST 
and CLSI methodology. These data showed distribution towards higher MICs especially for Lichtheimia and 
Rhizopus compared to the data obtained by CLSI methodology. Based on the in vitro data and on the clinical 
trough level of approximately 4 mg/l, it could be derived that the isavuconazole levels in mucormycosis 
patients will not always be sufficient for an adequate treatment. In vitro data for Mucorales are however very 
limited and the acceptability of isavuconazole for Mucorales infections largely depends on the clinical data.  
Comparisons of susceptibility data for Aspergillus spp obtained by CLSI and EUCAST methods showed that 
the MIC data determined by the EUCAST method may be up to maximally 2 dilutions higher than the MIC 
data determined by the CLSI method. However, based on the data that were provided and the data in the 
original submission, the in vitro data still indicate that Aspergillus spp are susceptible to isavuconazole, also 
when these methodological differences are taken into account. 
In a neutropenic mice pulmonary infection model of Aspergillus fumigatus infection, efficacy correlated well 
with AUC/MIC. Although no direct comparison was made between the three PK/PD indices, available data 
indicate that AUC/MIC is the most likely parameter that correlates best with efficacy.  
In a pulmonary mouse model in which isavuconazonium was administered subcutaneously, isavuconazole 
was not effective. Isavuconazonium is not tolerated when administered subcutaneously. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods: Plasma concentrations of isavuconazonium, isavuconazole, and BAL8728 in mice, rats, 
rabbits and monkeys were simultaneously analysed by LC-MS/MS. The same method was validated for 
isavuconazole concentrations in rat milk.  
Single dose absorption and plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics: In rats and monkeys, the in vivo 
conversion of isavuconazonium by plasma esterases to isavuconazole and BAL8728 is very fast. In addition, 
isavuconazonium is hydrolyzed due to instability at physiological pH. In monkeys, bioavailability at very high 
single oral doses was < 10%, indicating saturation of absorption. The distribution volume was high in rats, 
monkeys and humans. Due to systemic conversion, plasma clearance of isavuconazonium is very high. Oral 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015

absorption and bioavailability are high. After a single oral dose of isavuconazonium, plasma isavuconazole 
levels after reaching Cmax are similar to those after the same dose administered intravenously. Distribution 
volume is high. Elimination half-life values differ between species: rat (5 h) < monkey (9.8 h) << human 
(110-115 h). Systemic exposure to the unchanged prodrug was very low to below quantifiable levels after the 
first few hours after i.v. administration or from the first sampled time point (30 min) on after an oral dose. 
Systemic exposure to BAL8728 was very low. This part of the molecule had much shorter elimination half-life 
than isavuconazole and a smaller distribution volume.  
Toxicokinetics in the species used for toxicity studies: Toxicokinetic data during oral and intravenous 
administration in mice and rats have shown higher exposure in females as compared to males after single 
and repeated dosing. In monkeys, after single or repeated oral or intravenous dosing there was no evidence 
of a gender effect. Overall exposure to isavuconazole increased approximately dose-proportionally in all three 
species. Exposure to isavuconazonium was generally either below detection levels or very low. In mice, a 
decrease in the exposure to isavuconazole was observed during a 13 weeks oral treatment period. In rats, 
repeated oral treatment administered for 13 weeks resulted in an increased exposure at a low and mid dose, 
and in a decreasing exposure at the highest dose. Between 13 and 26 weeks, no clear change in exposure 
was seen. During a 2-week intravenous rat study, little change in exposure was observed. In monkeys, no 
change in the isavuconazole exposure was seen during the repeated oral or intravenous dosing studies. In all 
studies, exposure to BAL8728 was low compared to that to isavuconazonium. In the repeated dose toxicity 
studies, up to the highest tested doses, exposure in general was lower than or similar to that in humans at 
the recommended human dose, see also toxicology section. 
Plasma protein binding: Plasma protein binding of isavuconazole over the concentration range of 0.2-20 
µg/mL was high with small interspecies differences: 98.7%-99.1% in ICR mice, 97.3%-97.9% in Wistar rats, 
97.3%-97.8% in SD rats, 96.4%-97.2% in Hartley guinea pigs, 97.3%-98.0% in Himalayan rabbits, 99.0% 
in Cynomolgus monkeys, and 99.2%-99.4% in humans (Caucasians). In the tested rodents, guinea pigs and 
rabbits, binding was slightly concentration dependent, whereas in monkeys and humans no concentration 
dependence was observed.  
Distribution to red blood cells: Blood to plasma concentration ratios observed in rats and monkeys indicate a 
low red blood cell penetration of the main circulating components, in particular of isavuconazole, during the 
first 24 hours after administration, with blood to plasma concentration ratios predominantly in the range 0.53 
to 0.75. 
Tissue distribution studies: Single dose (oral and intravenous) studies were conducted in male Sprague 
Dawley (SD) and Long Evans rats, single dose intravenous studies in pregnant and lactating female SD rats, 
and repeated oral dose studies were conducted in male SD rats. The radiolabel on both of the two different 
labelling sites (the isavuconazole part and the BAL8728 part of the molecule) was quickly absorbed and 
distributed. The radiolabel in the isavuconazole part showed a wide distribution, with highest concentrations 
in the liver (T/P 15.2) and in the adrenal cortex (T/P 13.5). Other tissues with T/P ≥ 5(in descending order) 
were: small intestinal mucosa, brown fat, Harderian gland, pancreas, intra-orbital lacrimal gland, kidney 
cortex, adrenal medulla, stomach mucosa, and the thyroid. It was also high in bile and urine (bile >> urine). 
The radiolabel in the BAL8728 part showed lower concentrations than the isavuconazole part. A wide 
distribution was shown, with the highest concentrations noted in the parodontium (T/P>10), kidney (T/P 2.5) 
and liver (T/P 1.5). It was also high in urine. Disappearance from tissues was fast. Both radiolabels cross the 
brain blood barrier. In an oral single dose rat study with unlabelled prodrug, isavuconazole exposure of brain 
was slightly less than twice that in plasma. There was no evidence of a specific affinity for melanin containing 
tissues. After repeated oral dose in rats of prodrug labelled in the isavuconazole part, maximum plasma and 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 28/162 
 
  
  
tissue concentrations increased from day 1 to 21 (with about a factor of 2), while AUC values for liver and 
adrenal cortex increased with a factor 3.6 and 8.  
Passage of the placenta was shown: after a low single intravenous dose or radiolabelled isavuconazonium in 
pregnant rats (GD14 and GD19) fetal isavuconazole-related radioactivity was similar to maternal plasma and 
BAL8728-related radioactivity in foetuses was lower than maternal plasma. Transfer to the rat milk was 
shown on LD14 after a single intravenous dose (5 mg/kg) and isavuconazole related radioactivity showed 
concentrations in milk higher than in the maternal plasma. Looking at the BAL8728-related radioactivity, the 
concentration in milk was this time lower than that in the maternal plasma. Both labels were present at very 
low concentrations (up to non-detectable) in blood and tissues of pups of the treated dams on LD14. In a 
pre- and post-natal rat development study with non-labelled oral doses, milk to plasma ratios of mean 
concentrations 4 h post-dose (lactation day 16) increased from 3 at the lowest dose to 7 at the high dose 
(plasma concentration high dose: 4060 ng/mL). The highest individual milk to plasma ratio was 17. 
Conversion to active drug and inactive moiety: Isavuconazonium was quantitatively converted to the active 
moiety, isavuconazole, with a t1/2 < 2 min in vitro, in rat, rabbit, Cynomolgus monkey, and in the human 
plasma. This rate of conversion was found for both diastereomers in rat, Cynomolgus monkey, and human 
plasma. In contrast, isavuconazonium was minimally (less than 20% in 5 min) converted in dog plasma. The 
use of an esterase inhibitor led to the inhibition of the conversion in rat, Cynomolgus monkey, and human 
plasma, suggesting the involvement of plasma esterases. In vivo, tmax of isavuconazole and BAL8728 after 
intravenous administration to rats and monkeys was 5 min. At physiological pH, isavuconazonium is also 
hydrolysed due to instability at this pH. It is plausible that after oral administration enzymatic as well non-
enzymatic conversion (due to high intestinal pH) in the intestine, intestinal wall, and liver play a role in the 
conversion process.  
In vitro biotransformation of isavuconazole and isavuconazonium by liver microsomes/hepatocytes: Liver 
microsomes formed mono-oxidised (rat, monkey, human, rabbit: two isomers: epoxides and/or -OH 
metabolites) and di-oxidised (rabbit: di-OH) metabolites. Rat hepatocytes formed glutathion-, cystein- and N-
acetylcystein- conjugates of defluorinated mono-oxidised isavuconazole. All metabolites observed in 
incubations with human microsomes and hepatocytes were also observed with rat and monkey microsomes 
and hepatocytes. The rate and extensiveness of biotransformation in rats was higher than in monkeys and 
humans. Rabbit microsomes formed higher amounts of oxidation products than the other species. Little 
metabolism was found with dog microsomes. In all these test systems the amounts of metabolites were only 
minor compared to isavuconazole. Microsomal incubations of the pro-drug isavuconazonium resulted in the 
same metabolites but at lower quantities.  
In vivo biotransformation: Plasma, urine, bile or faeces samples from rats, Cynomolgus monkeys, and 
humans following intravenous or oral administration of [cyano-14C] isavuconazonium or [pyridinylmethyl-14C] 
isavuconazonium were used to identify metabolites. Chemical structures of a total of 77 metabolites were 
estimated based on various analytical methods, most of these metabolites occurred only in small quantities. 
In rats, after single intravenous or oral administration of radiolabelled isavuconazonium sulfate, M7 
(carboxylic acid form of destriazole isavuconazole) and M4 (oxidative carbamate cleavage metabolite of 
BAL8728) were the most abundant components in plasma in addition to the primary cleavage products and 
lower concentrations of a number of other identified and unidentified components.  
In Cynomolgus monkeys, after single intravenous or oral administration of radiolabelled isavuconazonium 
sulfate, isavuconazole and M4 were the main detected components. Lower amounts of M61 (O-glucuronide of 
isavuconazole) and M1 (hydroxylated isavuconazole carbamoyl form) and BAL8728 (only after intravenous 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 29/162 
 
  
  
administration) were found, and lower concentrations of a number of other identified and unidentified 
components. 
Metabolic pathway of isavuconazonium in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys: The major metabolic pathways of 
isavuconazonium in rats and in Cynomolgus monkeys were the cleavage of isavuconazonium, followed by 
generation of isavuconazole and BAL8728 (M5). After the thiazole ring of isavuconazole was cleaved, 
metabolites were formed by oxidation and subsequent glucuronidation, acetylcysteine conjugation, hydrolysis 
of cyano group, oxidation of the carbamoyl form in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. Isavuconazole was also 
metabolized by oxidation and subsequent glucuronidation or glutathione conjugation, and then 
cysteinylglycine conjugation through hydrolysis in rats, and by glucuronidation, oxidation and subsequent 
glucuronidation, hydrolysis of cyano group, oxidation of the carbamoyl form or cysteinylglycine conjugation, 
and then cysteine conjugation through hydrolysis in Cynomolgus monkeys. The carbamate group of BAL8728 
was cleaved and metabolized by oxidation or glucuronide conjugation in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
BAL8728 was also metabolized by glutathione conjugation, and then cysteine conjugation through hydrolysis 
in rats, and by cysteine and acetylcysteine conjugations in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Comparison to humans: Overall, the biotransformation pathways in rats, monkeys and humans are similar, 
with limited contribution of metabolites to overall drug-related exposure. There were no human metabolites 
occurring at ≥ 10% of the overall radioactivity. Therefore, with regard to biotransformation and exposure to 
metabolites, rat and monkey can be considered sufficiently similar to humans. 
Liver enzyme induction: Liver enzyme induction was studied in SD rats and in Cynomolgus monkeys which 
received a 2-h continuous infusion of isavuconazonium chloride (0, 10, 30, 60 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. 
Induction of testosterone 2β- and 6β-hydroxylase activities (CYP3A markers) and testosterone 16β-
hydroxylase activity (CYP2B marker) was observed in female (but not in male) rats. In monkeys, induction of 
total P450 concentration, p-nitroanisole O-demethylase activity and testosterone 16β-hydroxylase activity 
(CYP2B marker) was observed without a clear gender difference. These changes almost recovered to control 
levels after a 4-week recovery period. 
Excretion: In both rats and monkeys, the excretion route of isavuconazole-related and BAL8728-related 
radioactivity was hardly or not affected by the administration route (oral vs intravenous). In the rat excretion 
of isavuconazole (active moiety)-related radioactivity was predominantly faecal (81% vs in 16-20 % in 
urine), whereas in the monkey the difference between faecal (55-58%) and urinary (38-43%) excretion was 
much smaller. Excretion of BAL8728-related radioactivity did not differ between rats and monkeys, and was 
predominantly urinary (84-90%), with smaller amounts in faeces (7-11%). Studies in bile duct-cannulated 
rats and monkeys showed that biliary excretion of isavuconazole-related radioactivity after intravenous 
administration was similar (rats 81-88 %, monkeys 56%) to faecal excretion in intact animals, however 
biliary excretion of BAL8728-related radioactivity was higher (rats 19 - 35 %, monkeys 18 %) than faecal 
excretion in intact animals, concomitant with lower urinary excretion (rat 64%, monkey 81%) than in intact 
animals. These data suggest that in intact animals, part of the excreted BAL8728-related biliary radioactivity 
is reabsorbed and subsequently excreted in urine.  Enterohepatic circulation of constituents derived from 
both parts of the isavuconazonium sulfate molecule was confirmed in enterohepatic circulation studies in rats. 
The main excretion route of the reabsorbed material was the same as for the initially absorbed radioactivity: 
predominantly biliary for isavuconazole related radioactivity and predominantly urinary for reabsorbed 
BAL8728-related radioactivity.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose oral and intravenous administration studies with isavuconazonium were conducted in rats and 
Cynomolgus monkeys.  
In both species, adverse effects included neurological effects (decrease of spontaneous activity, prone 
position, staggering gait, jumping) and effects on the respiratory system (laboured respiration, cyanosis) at 
approximately 15 minutes after dosing. These effects are consistent with toxicities expected for triazole 
antifungal agents. 
Maximal non-lethal doses were 500 mg/kg in rats and 1000 mg/kg in monkeys after oral administration. 
After intravenous administration in rats, these values were 5 mg/kg at an infusion rate of 1 ml/min and 20 
mg/kg at an infusion rate of 0.1 ml/min. In monkeys, maximum non-toxic doses were 32 mg/kg after a 
single, intravenous bolus injection and 90 mg/kg after 2-h intravenous infusion. The slightly higher toxicity at 
a faster intravenous administration suggests that this compound should not be too rapidly infused clinically. 
Toxicokinetics after single dose administration have only been performed in monkeys. These data showed 
that Cmax values for isavuconazole at the maximal oral non-lethal dose of 1000 mg/kg (≈ 18600 ng/ml) 
were in the same range as the measured Cmax value in human at the starting dose of 600 mg (≈  20028 
ng/ml). After i.v. bolus and i.v. infusion, these Cmax values were in the same range. 
Higher dose levels induced death preceded by liver dysfunction and/or hepatic injury (such as increased 
plasma levels of ALT, AST, creatinine, and decreased levels of protein, albumin and cholesterol) and 
disturbance of serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, inorganic phosphorus, calcium). Animals that escaped 
death smoothly recovered to the normal condition.  
All these suggest a steep dose-response curve for the lethal and toxic effects of isavuconazole. The relevance 
of this finding for humans is not clear. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Oral studies 
Repeated dose toxicity after oral administration was studied in mice (up to 13 weeks), rats (up to 26 weeks), 
and Cynomolgus monkeys (up to 39 weeks) at exposures of isavuconazole up to 1.2-fold, 0.5-fold and 0.8-
fold, respectively, when compared to human exposure at the maintenance dose of 200 mg per day. Adverse 
effects included dose-related effects on the liver (mice, rats, monkeys), adrenals (monkeys), thyroid (rats) 
and adverse effects on the CNS and respiratory system (mice). These effects were consistent with toxicities 
expected for triazole antifungal agents and showed evidence of reversibility following a recovery period.  
In mice, there was induction of centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, a higher incidence of hepatocellular 
vacuolation and increased liver weight. These effects are common histological changes associated with the 
induction of drug metabolizing enzymes in animals. Elevated alanine aminotransferase levels were observed 
in high dose females. The lower cholesterol levels in high dose males and females were attributed to adverse 
effects on the liver and reduced general condition, respectively. In the high dose group, there were transient 
signs of respiratory distress and/or impaired general condition. Sustained effects on the CNS or respiratory 
system were not seen at non-lethal doses. 
In rats, mortality, adverse effects on the nervous and respiratory system were not observed in the tested 
dose range (up to 0.5-fold of the human exposure). The increased liver weight and centrilobular hypertrophy 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015

were not accompanied by increases of liver enzymes in plasma, suggesting that liver injury did not occur at 
these low exposures. A new finding in rats was that the thyroid was enlarged with minimal to slight follicular 
thyroid cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia. This effect may be caused by an accelerated thyroxine catabolism in the 
liver, secondary to liver enzyme induction. Rats are particularly sensitive to changes in thyroxine and T4 in 
plasma, as their blood contains no thyroxin-binding globulin, in contrast to most other mammals, including 
humans. The thyroid findings in rats are unlikely to be relevant for human.  
There were minimal increases in adrenal weights, but, in the tested dose range, there were no associated 
morphological changes at microscopic examination. Effects on the adrenals are well-known for triazole 
antifungal agents. Compounds of this class inhibit the activity of several enzymes necessary for the 
conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones and glucocorticoids. 
In the 26-week study in rats, changes in the pancreas, consisting of minimal to slight islet fibrosis, minimal 
to slight yellowish pigment-loaded macrophages and minimal islet cell inflammation, were observed in males. 
The applicant commented that these changes were not related to the test item, but that this was rather a 
chance finding. The provided argumentation was considered reasonable by the CHMP. Although these 
changes were not found in the study controls, they were present in the controls at the end of the treatment-
free period with a similar incidence as in the high dose group at the end of the treatment period (50% vs. 
56%). Acute pancreatitis is discussed in the Risk Management Plan as a class effect of this type of antifungal 
agents. 
In the 26-week oral rat study with the sulfate salt of BAL8557 (study 9766-TX-0016) thyroid findings were 
seen at 90 mg/kg/day in both males and females that consisted of minimal to slight follicular cell 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia. These findings were considered to be adaptive. In the final study report it is stated 
that these findings were no longer present after an additional 4-week treatment-free period, except for 
persistence of pre-neoplastic lesions (focal hyperplasia) in the thyroids of 2/6 recovery animals at 90 mg/kg, 
suggesting a potentially increased incidence of proliferative lesions (focal hyperplasia) in the thyroid after 
prolonged duration of treatment of rats at 90 mg/kg/day. This effect is considered to be the result of 
prolonged hyperstimulation of the thyroid gland as a consequence of drug-related liver enzyme induction. 
These effects are commonly reversible; however, as the recovery period was short, recovery was not seen. 
As already mentioned, the rat is sensitive to the stimulation of TSH due to the absence of circulating 
thyroxin-binding globulin.  
In monkeys, adverse effects in the tested dose range were focused on increased liver and adrenal weight and 
slightly increased heart weight (up to 0.5-fold of the human exposure).  
In the four weeks study, mortality and severe toxicity occurred at exposures which were in the same range 
as that in human at the starting dose of 600 mg. This was also found in the single dose toxicity study in 
monkeys.  
The increased liver weight was slight and was identified as hepatocellular hypertrophy related to enzyme 
induction.  
The increased adrenal weights correlated with enlarged adrenals and slight vacuolation/hypertrophy of the 
adrenocortical cells. Atrophic or necrotic lesions were not observed. These adrenal changes are well-known 
effects of triazole antifungal agents (including voriconazole and fluconazole) and are thought to result from 
inhibition of CYP enzymes and steroidogenesis. There were no effects in other organs or effects or changes in 
cholesterol levels in plasma that could point to an effect on steroid biosynthesis or cholesterol metabolism.  
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 32/162 
 
  
  
There was a slight increase in the heart weight and this was only observed in males of the 39-week study. 
There were no histopathological findings. The uncorrected mean QT-interval was minimally but significantly 
prolonged in week 26, but remained within the physiological range after correction for the slightly lower heart 
rates when compared with controls. However, isavuconazole inhibited the L-type calcium channel (hCav1.2) 
with an IC50 of 6.57 µM (38-fold the human non-protein bound Cmax at the clinical maintenance dose of 200 
mg/day) (see section safety pharmacology, study 9766-PT-0003). This ion channel finding is consistent with 
the QTcF interval shortening reported in the clinical thorough QT study (clinical assessment report on safety 
pharmacology). Triazole antifungal agents, such as voriconazole and fluconazole, have been associated with 
QT-interval prolongation. 
Intravenous studies 
The intravenous repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted up to 6 weeks in rats and in Cynomolgus 
monkeys. In the 6-week study in rats, the maximal exposures of isavuconazole were 0.02-fold when 
compared to human exposure at the maintenance dose of 200 mg. In the 6-weeks study in monkeys, this 
exposure multiple is 0.73-fold. With these exposure multiples, only the exposure to isavuconazole in the 6 
week study in monkeys is in the same range as compared to that in the oral repeated-dose toxicity studies in 
this species.  
In the 6-weeks studies, the NOAEL in rats and monkeys was 10 mg/kg/day based on irritation and 
intolerance at the infusion site, which in part could in part be reduced by reducing the rate of infusion. At 
higher doses, the toxicity profile and the target organs of toxicity were basically similar to that observed after 
oral administration. The low exposure in rats, could explain that effects were limited to the slight effects on 
the liver.  
In rats, the infusion site reaction consisted of local swelling and irritation. In monkeys, it consisted of a 
moderate/marked inflammation, accompanied by an increase of white blood cells, neutrophils and platelets in 
blood and a decrease of bone marrow cellularity. In addition, in monkeys, there was a reduction in thymus 
weight, but there were no remarkable pathology changes. An immunotoxic effect seems not likely there were 
no alterations in immune system organ weights and/or histology in the oral and intravenous repeated dose 
toxicity studies. 
In monkeys, new findings in the 2-weeks i.v. study included dose-related increased weights of testes, 
epididymides and seminal vesicles at 0.9-fold and a reduction in uterus weight at 1.9-fold of the human 
exposures at the maintenance dose of 200 mg/day. These effects could be related to the inhibitory potential 
of isavuconazole on the synthesis of steroids. These effects were not observed in the 6-weeks i.v. study in in 
the tested dose range, i.e. up to 0.73-fold of the human exposures at the maintenance dose of 200 mg/day. 
In addition, there was an increase in thyroid weight, but this effect seems to be incidental finding since it the 
increase was slight and only observed the high dose males in the 2-week study. 
Intravenous administration of the inactive cleavage product BAL8728 for 2 weeks to rats showed no 
remarkable findings. This suggests that that the toxic effects observed with isavuconazonium were due to 
isavuconazole and not to the inactive cleavage product BAL8728. 
Genotoxicity 
Isavuconazonium showed no genotoxic potential. It was non-mutagenic in in vitro mutation tests in bacteria 
(Ames test). In the mouse lymphoma cell thymidine kinase assay for chromosomal aberrations, 
isavuconazonium showed marginal increases in mutant colonies. The findings were considered as 
cytotoxicity-related variability and did not indicate a biologically relevant genotoxic activity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 33/162 
 
  
  
The in vivo data indirectly support the view that the inactive cleavage product BAL8728 also had no 
detectable genotoxic potential. This conclusion was further supported by the fact that the structure of the 
inactive cleavage product BAL8728 had no genotoxic alerts by DEREK analysis. 
Since the active moiety, isavuconazole, contains an azole ring that has been associated with genotoxic 
potential, an additional bacterial reverse mutation test and an in vitro micronucleus test were performed only 
on the active moiety. The results showed no concerns. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. Nevertheless, it was acknowledged that in some patients, 
treatment could be continued beyond 6 months. Since for medicinal products aimed for long-term treatment, 
carcinogenicity studies are required, CHMP requested the applicant to perform the carcinogenicity testing of 
isavuconazonium in mice and rats, according to ICH guidelines and to submit the results of these studies by 
the end of July 2019.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
In pregnant rats, [cyano-14C]-isavuconazonium-derived material passed the placental barrier and was 
transferred to the foetus (see also section on pharmacokinetics). 
The reproduction toxicity studies showed that isavuconazonium, as a member of the triazole class of 
antifungal agents, has the potential to adversely affect the embryo-foetal development. For this reason, 
Cresemba must not be used during pregnancy, except in patients with severe or potentially life-threatening 
fungal infections, in whom isavuconazole may be used if the anticipated benefits outweigh the possible risks 
to the foetus. Cresemba is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
The segment I study in rats showed no effect on male and female fertility. However, although not observed in 
rats, there was a dose-related increased weights of testes, epididymides and seminal vesicles and a reduction 
in uterus weight in a 2-weeks, i.v. repeated dose toxicity study in monkeys at exposures obtained in human 
at the therapeutic range of 200 mg per day (study nr 9766-TX-0011 [study nr 9777-ME-007 for 
toxicokinetics]). The relevance of this finding for human male and female fertility is unknown. Nevertheless, 
CHMP noted that there were relevant data (non-human primate and rat) that superseded the 2 week non-
human primate data, in which these effects were not seen. 
The segment II studies in rats showed skeletal abnormalities at maternal systemic exposures of 30 
mg/kg/day (0.2-fold the human systemic exposure at the maintenance dose of 200 mg/day). These 
abnormalities consisted of fusions of the zygomatic arch, unilateral and bilateral rudimentary cervical ribs, 
and additional ossification of the fourth lumbar vertebral arch. The results of a segment II study in rats did 
not point to adverse effects of the inactive cleavage product BAL8728 on embryo-foetal development. 
The segment II study in rabbits showed a visceral variation, including an additional artery arising from the 
aortic arch and skeletal abnormalities, including rudimentary cervical ribs were reported at exposures of 0.1-
fold the human systemic exposure at the maintenance dose of 200 mg/day. The findings were not associated 
with maternal toxicity.  
The segment III study in rats showed post-natal loss in the high dose group was increased (0.5-fold the 
human systemic exposure at the maintenance dose of 200 mg/day). Many of the dead pups had no milk in 
their stomachs. In the surviving pups from the high dose group as well as pups in the mid and low dose 
groups, the physical development, behavioural tests, and reproductive capacity was not affected by in utero 
and peri-/postnatal exposure to isavuconazole. 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 34/162 
 
  
  
Toxicokinetics showed that the concentrations of isavuconazole in rat milk exceeded the plasma 
concentrations by up to 17-fold. There are no human data. For this reason, breast-feeding should be 
discontinued during treatment with isavuconazonium. 
Local Tolerance  
Studies in rabbits on local tolerance did not raise any concern. Minimal eye irritation and clear vascular 
permeability were observed at 5 mg/ml and slight skin irritation at 10 mg/ml. These concentrations are 
sufficient above the proposed clinical concentration of 1.5 mg/ml isavuconazonium as concentrate for solution 
for infusion (corresponding to approximately 0.8 mg/ml isavuconazole). 
A haemolytic potential was identified at concentrations of 1 mg/ml and higher. This means that at the 
estimated Cmax values in humans (20 μg/ml at the starting dose of 600 mg/day and 7.5 μg/ml at the 
maintenance dose of 200 mg/day), there is clinically little or no haemolytic potential. 
Other toxicity studies 
Juvenile toxicity 
A dose-range-finding study and a pivotal study in juvenile rats are currently ongoing.  
Phototoxicity 
It is considered unlikely that the exposure to isavuconazonium and isavuconazole could lead to a phototoxic 
effect. Both compounds have a similar absorption spectrum and a similar molar extinction coefficient in the 
UV wavelength range of 250 to 320 nm. Thus, it seems that the UV absorption spectrum of isavuconazonium 
is largely determined by the isavuconazole structure of isavuconazonium. The results of the phototoxicity test 
in 3T3 fibroblasts showed that that this compound had no phototoxic potential. In aqueous solution, 
isavuconazonium was hydrolysed to isavuconazole. This hydrolysis occured very quickly in plasma and was 
caused by plasma esterases. 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunotoxicity studies have not been conducted. This is considered acceptable by CHMP, since the results of 
the repeat-dose toxicity studies did not indicate significant effects on organs of the immune system. 
Antigenicity 
Isavuconazonium showed no discernible antigenic potential in the guinea pig active systemic anaphylaxis 
assay and the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay. However, isavuconazonium showed skin sensitization 
potential in the more sensitive mouse local lymph node assay (LLNA). For this reason, hypersensitivity is 
included in the RMP. 
Metabolites 
The provided data did not point to a toxic effect of the pharmacologically inactive cleavage product BAL8728. 
The toxicity of other metabolites has not been studied. This was considered acceptable by CHMP. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 35/162 
 
  
  
nonclinical characterization of a human metabolite is only warranted when that metabolite is observed at 
exposures greater than 10% of total drug-related exposure and at significantly greater levels in humans than 
the maximum exposure seen in the toxicity studies (EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995). 
Impurities 
Twelve identified impurities may occur in the drug substance at NMT 0.15%. The safety of these impurities 
has been evaluated by their presence in the batches used in the repeated-dose and reproduction toxicity 
studies. These impurities have also been evaluated for genotoxic potential. BAL19714 showed an alert for 
genotoxicity by DEREK analysis. It was positive in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames II test) with the 
positive response being more prominent in the absence than in presence of metabolic activation. The 
proposed limit of 100 ppm of this impurity in the drug substance is agreed by CHMP, following the approach 
of the ICH guideline M7 on mutagenic impurities (EMA/CHMP/ICH/83812/2013), At the proposed 
maintenance dose of 372.6 mg isavuconazonium sulfate per day (≈ 200 mg isavocunazole), the limit of 100 
ppm would lead to a daily intake of 37 µg of this impurity. This intake is lower than the calculated acceptable 
intakes of 200 µg of a genotoxic impurity if the treatment is administered no longer than 6 months and 100 
µg if administered no longer than 12 months. 
A mutagenic potential was also identified for BAL17699 and BAL17478. These compound are limit controlled 
to <1 ppm and, as such would result in administration of less than the threshold for concern (TTC) level of 
1.5 μg/day. 
The impurities BAL20019, BAL30655, BAL19875 and BAL20027 showed no structural alert for mutagenicity in 
DEREK analyses. Based on this information, it is concluded that these impurities can be considered to be non-
mutagenic (class 5). 
The impurity BAL8728 is identical to metabolite M5, which generated by the cleavage of isavuconazonium by 
plasma esterases to isavuconazole. This impurity had no genotoxic alerts in the DEREK analysis.  
The impurities BAL30145, BAL31265 and BAL4815 are qualified by the toxicity studies impurity profile of 
toxicological batches used in the repeated-dose and reproduction toxicity studies. 
Other impurities in the drug substance include BAL16173 and BAL17702, which are starting materials, and 
the drug substance impurities BAL19715 (chloromethyl-pyridine impurity of BAL8557), BAL31264, BAL31265, 
diisopropylurea and 2-butenal. The proposed limits of these impurities in the drug substance have been 
adequately justified and were agreed by CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
It could not be concluded whether isavuconazole is a PBT and/or vPvB substance. 
Considering the available data on the environmental risk assessment, CHMP agreed that isavuconazole is not 
expected to pose a risk to the groundwater compartment and the sewage treatment plant. 
Nevertheless, a risk to the surface water compartment and sediment could not be excluded. 
The applicant proposed to conduct an algal toxicity test (OECD 201) and a sediment toxicity study (OECD 
218) post-approval, and to update the ERA with the results of these studies. However, CHMP requested the 
applicant to use the total residue approach (resulting in a DOSEai of 384.8 mg/inh/day) when the ERA is 
when the ERA is updated. In addition, submitted peer review data on incidence in France and Austria were

considered by CHMP as not acceptable as a replacement of the AMR database, since these data cover only 
two member states and do not invalidate the data from the AMR database. CHMP agreed to request the 
applicant to use the data from the AMR database when updating the ERA. 
The revised environmental risk assessment and the above mentioned study results should be submitted for 
assessment no later than end of August 2016.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant was requested by CHMP and has agreed to perform after registration the carcinogenicity testing 
of isavuconazonium in mice and rats, according to the ICH guidelines. 
Considering the Environmental Risk Assessment, isavuconazole is not expected to pose a risk to the 
groundwater compartment and the sewage treatment plant. Nevertheless, CHMP agreed that the ERA part of 
the dossier was not complete. The applicant proposed to conduct an algal toxicity test (OECD 201) and a 
sediment toxicity study (OECD 218) post-approval, and to update the ERA with the results of these studies.  
However, CHMP required that when the ERA is updated, the total residue approach (resulting in a DOSEai of 
384.8 mg/inh/day) should be used by the Applicant. Besides, the peer review data on incidence in France and 
Austria are not acceptable as a replacement of the AMR database, since these data cover only two member 
states and do not invalidate the data from the AMR database. Thus, CHMP agreed to request the applicant to 
use the data from the AMR database when updating their ERA. 
The revised risk assessment and study results should be submitted no later than end of August 2016. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a nonclinical point of view, CHMP agreed that a marketing authorization can be granted. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the remaining non-clinical missing data, 
which can be solved post-approval: 
 
The remaining concern on the environmental risk assessment (ERA): the algal toxicity test (OECD 
201) and a sediment toxicity study (OECD 218) will be conducted the ERA will be updated with the 
results of these studies. For this update the applicant should use the total residue approach (resulting 
in a DOSEai of 384.8 mg/inh/day) and the data from the AMR database should. The revised ERA and 
the results of the above mentioned studies should be submitted for no later than end of August 2016. 
 
The remaining concern on carcinogenicity: the applicant is requested to perform the carcinogenicity 
testing of isavuconazonium in mice and rats according to ICH guidelines and to submit the results of 
these studies no later than the end of July 2019.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Eight studies in healthy subjects, 5 studies in special patients groups and 25 interaction studies were 
performed to support the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazonium/isavuconazole. In addition, the results of 2 
QT studies, and 5 phase 2/3 studies were also submitted for assessment. Moreover, 20 reports covering in 
vitro data and 5 reports with population pharmacokinetics data were also submitted.  
The prodrug isavuconazonium sulfate has a high solubility of about 1 g/ml over the pH range of 1 to about 7 
and water. The prodrug is administered as a racemate, which is rapidly converted (t1/2 less than 1.5 min) into 
the active moiety isavuconazole (single enantiomer). Small differences in the hydrolysis rate were observed 
between the 2 diastereromers, but these differences are unlikely to significantly affect the pharmacokinetic 
profiles of the active drug, isavuconazole.  
Analytical methods 
Fully validated methods have been applied for the analysis of isavuconazole, isavuconazonium and BAL8728 
in human plasma or urine. The methods were considered accurate and precise. In addition, stability data 
showed that the analytes were stable under sampling handling conditions.  
Regarding the analysis of study samples, CHMP agreed that the principles of the guidance on bioanalytical 
method validations were followed. Also for the analytes used in the interaction studies, fully validated 
methods have been applied, showing a good accuracy and precision.  
Bioequivalence 
For the i.v. formulation, isavuconazonium hydrochloride and isavuconazonium sulfate were used as pro-
drugs. Isavuconazonium hydrochloride was only used in 2 early phase one studies. Considering that the 
formulations are i.v. formulations, no concerns regarding bioavailability due to the use of the different salt 
were expressed. 
For the capsule formulation, isavuconazonium hydrochloride and isavuconazonium sulfate were also used as 
pro-drugs. Isavuconazonium hydrochloride was only used in a few early phase I studies. The only excipient 
added in these formulations was lactose. The capsule formulation was changed and isavuconazonium sulfate 
used as prodrug. This formulation was only used in 3 interaction studies and in a QT study. The capsule 
formulation was reformulated and this formulation was similar to the proposed commercial to be marketed 
formulation and used in the majority of the phase I studies and in the pivotal phase III studies.  
Disintegration time was comparable between the capsules. After disintegration isavuconazonium is very 
rapidly dissolved, as shown by dissolution data at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8. A cross study comparison of 
pharmacokinetic data for the 3 formulations did not indicate a difference in bioavailability.   
Absorption  
After oral administration, the pro-drug isavuconazonium is rapidly converted into the active moiety 
isavuconazole. Isavuconazonium is almost undetectable after oral administration. Maximum isavuconazole 
plasma concentrations are observed after about 2-3 h. The absolute bioavailability of the oral formulation is 
98%. After oral administration, Cmax is about 78% compared to i.v. administration (infusion 500 ml over 2 
h). Based upon comparable exposures after oral and i.v. administration, both formulations can be 
interchanged. 
After i.v. administration, isavuconazonium is rapidly converted into isavuconazole. Very low isavuconazonium 
plasma levels are observed, which rapidly decline.  A high fat, high caloric meal had no clinically relevant 
 
 
impact on isavuconazole pharmacokinetics after administration as its pro-drug isavuconazonium. Tmax was 
delayed by 2 h resulting in an 8% lower Cmax and a 10% higher AUC. Based upon these data, isavuconazole 
can be taken with or without food, as recommended in the SmPC.  
After a single i.v. administration, a more than dose proportional increase in AUCinf and Cmax is observed 
over the 40 – 160 mg dose range, i.e. AUCinf increased 6.3-fold and Cmax increased 5.5-fold. After multiple 
doses, a more or less proportional increase is observed over a 50 – 600 mg q.d. After a single oral 
administration, Cmax and AUCinf increased 3.8 and 5.7- fold over a 100 – 400 mg dose range. Proportional 
increases were observed over the 50 – 600 mg q.d. dose range. 
Non-linearity in pharmacokinetics is of less concern, as only one dose is recommended, i.e. a loading dose of 
200 mg t.i.d. at day 1 and 2, followed by 200 mg once daily. Isavuconazole did not show time-dependent 
pharmacokinetics. No unexpected accumulation was observed.  Steady state was achieved after about 14 
days, which is consisted with an elimination half-life of about 100 - 130 h. However, by applying a loading 
dose of 200 mg t.i.d. at day 1 – 2, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg q.d., steady state was 
achieved at day 3. Intra-individual variability was not evaluated. The inter-individual variability in Cmax and 
AUC was generally about 20 – 30%, for i.v. as well as for oral administration. Population pharmacokinetics 
indicated an overall intersubject variability for AUC of 58% (%CV) and an intra-subject variability of 45 
(%CV). 
Pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and patients were comparable. Following the dose scheme 
recommended in the SmPC, mean isavuconazole trough concentrations of around and above 3 µg/ml were 
observed, which were above the targeted clinical MIC values of 1-2 µg/ml.  
Distribution 
Isavuconazole is not actively taken up into red blood cells. It is highly bound to plasma proteins (about 
99.3%). Comparable values were observed in patients with mild-severe renal impaired function and in 
patients with mild-moderate hepatic impairment. Taking into account the high volume of distribution of 450 
litres, drug-drug interactions due to protein displacement are not expected.   
Based upon animal data, isavuconazole may cross the blood-brain barrier and transfer over the placenta. 
Metabolism:  
After i.v. administration, isavuconazonium is rapidly converted into isavuconazole, during which the cleavage 
product BAL8728 is formed. After labelling the C-atom of the cleavage product BAL8728, mean recovery of 
radioactivity in urine and faeces samples was 98.4% over 168-hour, of which 96% in urine. In urine, 0.62% 
of the administered dose was recovered as BAL8728.  
The main metabolism pathway after intravenous administration to humans was considered to be the cleavage 
of isavuconazonium, followed by the generation of BAL8728. BAL8728 was predominantly metabolized to M4 
followed by glucuronide conjugation (M20). BAL8728 was also metabolized by oxidation and subsequent 
glucuronide, or cysteine and acetylcysteine conjugation. 
After oral administration, isavuconazonium plasma concentrations were almost undetectable. After labelling 
of the isavuconazole molecule, isavuconazole accounted for about 88% of the labelled plasma levels. 
BAL8728 plasma levels were not detectable or close to the LLOQ. Mean recovery of total radioactivity was 
45.5% in urine and 46.1% in faeces (total recovery 91.6% over a 600 h sampling period). In faeces, 33% 
could be recovered as parent over the sampling period of 0 – 144h, next to 18 metabolites each presenting 
less than 1% of the dose. In urine, only low levels of isavuconazole could be detected. In addition, 12 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 58/162 
 
  
  
metabolites were detected, of which metabolites M11 to M14 were the main metabolites, accounting for 
about 50% of the radioactivity.  
The main metabolism pathway of isavuconazonium after oral administration to humans was considered to be 
cleavage of isavuconazonium, followed by generation of isavuconazole and its oxidation and cleavage of the 
thiazole ring of isavuconazole. Isavuconazole was metabolized by oxidation, hydrolysis of cyano group and 
oxidation of the carbamoyl form. In addition, after cleavage of the thiazole ring, additional metabolites were 
formed by oxidation and subsequent glucuronide and acetylcysteine conjugation, or hydrolysis of cyano 
group, and oxidation of the carbamoyl form and glucuronide or acetylcysteine conjugation. 
Except for the active moiety isavuconazole, no individual metabolite was observed with an AUC > 10 % of 
the parent. 
It should be noted that metabolic profiles in urine were identified up to 144 h after administration, which 
accounted 30% of the administered radioactive dose for urine, while over the whole 600 h period 45.5% was 
recovered. For faeces this was 23.7% of the 46.1%.    
Elimination 
The plasma elimination half-life of isavuconazole is about 100 -130 h. The plasma elimination half-life of the 
cleavage product BAL8728 is about 1 h. Isavuconazole CL after single i.v. dose was about 2300 ml/h. CL/F 
after a single oral dose was about 2360 ml/h, indicative for a low (hepatic) clearance. Renal clearance ranged 
from 7.4 – 14 ml/h. 
Special populations 
No significant gender effect was observed. In addition, no clinically significant effect of age was observed. 
Therefore, no dose adjustment in the elderly is required for isavuconazole; this is reflected in the Cresemba 
SmPC.  
Chinese subjects showed to have 15 – 50% higher exposure compared to Western subjects. The cause is 
unknown.  This difference was nevertheless considered as not clinically significant; therefore, no dose 
adjustment is required for isavuconazole. Limited data in Blacks and African American subjects indicate no 
difference in pharmacokinetics compared to Caucasians.   
Renal clearance of intact isavuconazole and its cleavage product BAL8728 is a minor excretion pathway. 
Therefore, an impact on clearance due to an impaired renal function is not anticipated. Indeed, in patients 
with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, Cmax and AUC were not statistical significant affected. For 
the cleavage product BAL8728 the AUC in patients with mild and severe renal impairment was about 25 – 
30% higher, while in patients with moderate renal impairment no effect was observed. However, BAL8728 
plasma levels were still very low. 
The effect of dialyzing ESRD subjects 1 hour prior to dosing (day 1) compared to dialyzing the subject just 
after the 1 hour infusion (day 15) on the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole was limited. AUC0-72h was 
about 30% higher post dialysis, independent if predialysis access line or postdialysis access line was 
evaluated. This effect may be attributed to the hemodilution effect. Predialysis access line or postdialysis 
access line pharmacokinetics were comparable. 
The observation that there is no difference in the plasma concentrations of isavuconazole between the 
predialysis and postdialysis access lines reflects the very low dialytic removal of the drug which is consistent 
with its very high protein binding (>99%). Further, the low dialytic removal indicates that supplementation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 59/162 
 
  
  
isavuconazole postdialysis will not be required and that an overdose of isavuconazole cannot be managed 
effectively with hemodialysis.  
No dose adjustment based on renal function is required for isavuconazole; this is reflected in the SmPC. 
Data have indicated that after i.v. administration total plasma Cl decreased by 30 and 51% in patients with 
mild and moderate hepatic impairment respectively (cirrhosis due to hepatitis B/C). Comparable results were 
observed for free plasma Cl (-34 and -63% respectively).  
After oral administration total plasma Cl/F decreased by 27 and 42% in patients with mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment, respectively. For free plasma Cl/F this was -28 and -61%, respectively. Comparable 
values were observed in patients with liver cirrhosis due to alcohol (see figure below). 
Figure 2  Effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetic parameters of isavuconazole 
The CHMP required that the results in mild and moderate hepatic impairment and the lack of data in severe 
hepatic impairment are reflected in the SmPC.  
Weight was one of the continuous covariates explored in the POPPK analysis described in study PK-005. Vp 
increased with BMI but weight was not per se identified as a significant covariate. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro data indicate that isavuconazonium is a substrate of human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChe). Drug 
interactions involving competition for BChE have not been reported in the literature. As such, it is not 
expected that the conversion of isavuconazonium into isavuconazole will be clinically relevant affected by a 
possible inhibition. 
Isavuconazole is a substrate for CYP3A4. There was no indication of a possible impact of genetic 
polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics, based on the results of a pilot pharmacogenomic study in subjects 
receiving isavuconazole.  
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 60/162 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
In addition, isavuconazole may induce CYP2B6. Moreover, isavuconazole may inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OCT2 and 
UGT. The possible interactions potential with these enzymes have been studied in vivo (see figures below).  
Additional peaks were often observed in the declining phase of individual isavuconazole plasma 
concentration-time profiles, occurring about 6 to 12 hours postdose, and coincided with a meal or snack. 
Biliary excretion was ‘confirmed’ in bile-duct cannulated rats. The enterohepatic recycling concerns excretion 
and reabsorption of isavuconazole.

1 Due to the unclear association between MPA pharmacokinetics and MPA-related toxicity, no specific dose recommendation can be made. 
Patients receiving isavuconazonium concurrently with MMF should be monitored for MPA-related toxicities. 
2 Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect. 
Two-fold and three-fold increases in the maintenance dose have shown an acceptable safety profile both in 
patients (study 9766-CL-0102) and healthy subjects (study 9766-CL-0017). However, CHMP considered that 
the patient group used in study 9766-CL-0102 (prophylaxis of patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute 
myeloid leukemia) was not representative. In addition, in study 9766-CL-0017 a clear increase in the number 
of AEs was observed at a 600 mg dose, so it cannot be excluded that a doubling of the exposure for a 200 
mg dose would result in higher AEs. Therefore, in such cases, caution is advised as adverse drug reactions 
may increase. 
Concomitant administration of lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir100 mg and Cresemba resulted in decreased 
exposure of lopinavir with concurrent decreases in the mean AUCs of lopinavir and ritonavir by 27% and 
31%, respectively. This could possibly result in loss of antiviral efficacy. No dose adjustment is necessary for 
isavuconazole when co-administered with lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg every 12 hours.  
Co-administration of Cresemba with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole is contraindicated as a 
significant increase in plasma exposure of isavuconazole of more than 5-fold is observed. The strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, increased the plasma exposure of isavuconazole by about 2-fold, therefore no 
dose adjustment is necessary, however caution is advised. As other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are considered 
to have a similar or a less potent CYP3A4 inhibition, this recommendation is also applicable to these CYP3A4 
inhibitors. 
Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inducers such as efavirenz, nafcillin and etravirine may result in a 
70% decrease in isavuconazole plasma levels (based upon literature data using midazolam as reference) 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 63/162 
 
  
  
 
 
 
which will result in loss of efficacy. These combinations are contraindicated.  As a mild inducer like aprepitant 
may reduce plasma levels of CYP3A4 substrates by 25%, this may be of concern for isavuconazole efficacy. 
Therefore, co-administration with mild CYP3A4 inducers such as aprepitant, prednisone and pioglitazone, may 
result in mild to moderate decreases of isavuconazole plasma levels and co-administration with mild CYP3A4 
inducers should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk. This has been included as a warning in 
SmPC section 4.4. 
A single dose of isavuconazonium decreased the exposure of indinavir by 36%. No interaction mechanism 
could be identified for the observed decrease in indinavir exposure after a single dose of isavuconazonium. 
The effect after multiple doses of isavuconazonium is unclear, i.e. the effect may be even more pronounced. 
Further decreases in indinavir concentration may have clinical implications. However, indinavir is almost not 
used anymore to treat HIV in the EU. Therefore the SmPC conservatively states that careful monitoring for 
any occurrence of lack of anti-viral efficacy should be applied and the indinavir dose could be increased if 
required.  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses were used to further explore and support the pharmacokinetics. At the 
time of assessment, no new PopPK analysis has been carried out. Data from study 105 are awaited and will 
be incorporated in a PopPK analysis. The applicant should submit these data no later than the end of May 
2016.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacological activity of isavuconazole has been investigated in in vitro and in vivo (animal and 
human) studies. In vivo data mainly came from two main clinical phase 3 studies: 
  Study 9766- CL-0104: a randomized, double blind, non-inferiority, active controlled study (versus 
voriconazole), which randomized 527 adult patients with proven, probable, or possible IFD caused by 
Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi. 
  Study 9766- CL-0103: an open-label study of isavuconazole in the treatment of renally impaired 
patients with aspergillosis and in the treatment of patients with invasive fungal disease caused by 
rare moulds, yeasts or dimorphic fungi. A subpopulation of 37 patients was enrolled, who were 
confirmed by an independent DRC to have proven or probable mucormycosis. 
Mechanism of action 
Isavuconazole inhibits fungal lanosterol-14 alpha-demethylase (P45014DM), which results in depletion of 
ergosterol and disruption of the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. In addition, inhibition of 
this enzyme leads to the accumulation of toxic methylated intermediates that inhibit fungal growth. 
Isavuconazole, like other azoles, thus demonstrates a fungicidal effect by blocking the synthesis of 
ergosterol.  
Inhibition of P45014DM extracted from C. albicans and rat liver gave IC50 values of isavuconazole that were 
0.043 and 4.0 mg/L, respectively. Based on the selectivity ratio, isavuconazole is expected to have moderate 
inhibitory activity against the human P450 enzyme.

Using CLSI methodology to test 1,717 worldwide isolates of Aspergillus the isavuconazole MIC50 and MIC90 
were 0.5 and 2 mg/L, respectively (range 0.06 to 32 mg/L). Using EUCAST methodology to test 1,563

In a study of isavuconazole using CLSI and EUCAST methodologies, DNA sequencing identified 189 A. terreus 
complex, 15 A. hortai and 30 falling in the Aspergillus terrei complex. Against all isolates, isavuconazole had 
a CLSI MIC90 of 0.5 mg/L and a EUCAST MIC90 of 1 mg/L.  
Acquired azole resistance in Aspergillus is relatively uncommon, except for fluconazole, and usually involves 
one or more mutational events in the gene encoding CYP51A. In addition, the CDR1B efflux transporter is 
associated with non-CYP51A-mediated itraconazole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus. Other mechanisms 
have been identified in Candida species (efflux pumps, over-expression of altered CYP51A and bypass 
pathways). Little is known about resistance mechanisms in other fungal species. 
Sixteen laboratory-derived isavuconazole-resistant mutants did not have point mutations in the CYP51A or 
CYP51B gene and showed no or a slight variation in the expression profile of the four efflux pump genes 
(MDR1-4). All of the resistant mutants showed cross-resistance with at least one of itraconazole and 
voriconazole. There was no clear evidence that acquired isavuconazole resistance reduced fitness in non-
clinical infection models. 
Aspergillus fumigatus (40) with CYP51A mutations conferring azole resistance were tested against 
isavuconazole using the CLSI methodology. The strains included 31 with alterations in their CYP51A sequence 
at M220 (n=9), G54 (n=6), G138/Y431/G434/G448 (n=5), L98 (n=3) and other mutations (n=8). The 
remaining nine strains were allocated to the group for wild-type CYP51A sequence.   
All had MICs > 8 mg/L for itraconazole MICs, of which 77% (24/31) and 68% (21/31) had raised MICs of 
posaconazole and voriconazole, respectively.  The isavuconazole MIC ranges of the CYP51A-mutated and wild 
type isolates were 0.5–>8 and 0.5–2 mg/L, respectively. Strains with alterations L98H, G138C, Y431C, 
G434C and G448S showed elevated MICs to all triazoles including isavuconazole.   
Isavuconazole MICs showed the highest degree of correlation with those for voriconazole (Spearman’s 
correlation coefficient 0.885, p <0.001). Isavuconazole MICs were more likely to be raised in strains of A.

fumigatus with reduced susceptibility to other triazoles, and tended to mirror changes in voriconazole 
susceptibility. There was no correlation between MICs for isavuconazole and ampB (-0.165, p <0.307). 
In a study of A. fumigatus isolates with various CYP51A mutations strains with mutations in the G54 and 
M220 codons had similar isavuconazole MICs to the wild-type isolates. Among the G54 and M220 mutants 
10/80 MICs were >2 mg/L. A. fumigatus isolates with TR34/L98H alterations tended to have higher 
isavuconazole MICs (29/40 were >2 mg/L). The activity of isavuconazole against A. fumigatus may be less 
affected by mutations at codons G54 and M220 compared with TR34/L98H. 
The PK/PD relationship of isavuconazole in a neutropenic murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis 
(IPA) was examined to assess the optimal drug exposure for infection due to wild-type and CYP51 mutant 
isolates. A dose-response relationship was observed and higher doses were needed to achieve an antifungal 
effect against isolates with elevated isavuconazole MICs. The total drug AUC/MIC associated with net stasis 
for the CYP51 wild-type group ranged from 415-1111 whereas for isolates F14403 and F14532 (the CYP51 
mutant) it was slightly lower at 361-367.  For all isolates where net stasis was achieved, the median static 
dose total drug AUC/MIC was 503. The 1 log10 kill total drug AUC/MIC was ~2-fold higher than the static dose 
PD target, with a median value of 1111.  AUC/MIC was a strong predictor of observed outcome (R2 = 0.75). 
The PK/PD relationship for isavuconazole was investigated in a validated dynamic in vitro model of the human 
alveolus using two wild-type and two mutant strains of Aspergillus fumigatus. The galactomannan index 
(GMI) was used as a quantitative biomarker to evaluate the antifungal efficacy of isavuconazole. Exposure-
response relationships with a trough concentration of 0.2-0.5 mg/L were observed for green fluorescent 
protein (GFP) and non-GFP expressing wild types with near maximal suppression of GM release. In contrast, 
only the highest concentration of isavuconazole suppressed GM in the F/16216 mutant and no suppression 
was noted for the F/11628 mutant strain. An AUC/MIC ratio of 11.40 resulted in a 90% probability of 
galactomannan suppression <1. 
From the two phase 3 studies, 136 baseline fungal isolates from 102 isavuconazole-treated patients (studies 
9766-CL-0103 and 9766-CL-0104) and 28 baseline fungal isolates from 25 voriconazole-treated patients 
(study 9766-CL-0104) were tested for susceptibility to isavuconazole and other antifungal drugs. The most 
common genus from both studies was Aspergillus spp. with A. fumigatus (n=37, isavuconazole: studies 
9766-CL-0104/9766-CL-0103; n=17 voriconazole: study 9766-CL-0104) as the most common species. 
Although MIC values for isavuconazole were generally similar to voriconazole MIC values, it is noted that 
regarding some Aspergillus isolates, isavuconazole MIC values of 8-32 were reported (this was irrespective of 
the testing method used (CLSI or EUCAST). MICs for posaconazole were in general lower, see table below:

Several other studies have been conducted to determine the in vitro activity of isavuconazole. Some of the 
most pertinent are mentioned above. In each case it was clear that for some Mucorales the MIC50 values 
exceed the breakpoints proposed for A. fumigatus. Overall, isavuconazole has shown variable in vitro activity 
against isolates of the Mucorales order (Absidia spp., Cunninghamella spp., Mucor spp., Rhizomucor spp. and 
Rhizopus spp.), often studied in low numbers. Isavuconazole tended to be most active against Rhizomucor 
and Rhizopus spp. in vitro (MIC90: 4–16 mg/L) and had the lowest in vitro activity against Cunninghamella 
spp. (MIC90: 16–32 mg/L).   
Additional MIC data on Mucorales (Arendrup 2015 and Cuenca Estrella 2015) were submitted. MICs using the 
EUCAST method (n=154) and CLSI method are shown in the following tables. There is a clear difference in 
MIC when both methods are compared, which is due to methodological differences, resulting in 1-2 dilutions 
higher MICs with the EUCAST method. The MIC pattern presented within the initial application is generally in 
line with that reported by Arendrup (2015) and Cuenca Estrella (2015), however MICs were generally higher 
within the initial application. With the currently recommended posology of isavuconazole, the average 
isavuconazole plasma trough level is approximately 4 mg/L (phase 3 clinical studies 9766-CL-0103 and 9766-
CL-0104). It is therefore expected that plasma levels will be attained that are above the EUCAST MIC of only 
a few Mucorales species (for instance Rhizopus and Rhizomucor). Lichtheimia species are less susceptible and 
Mucor species are regarded not susceptible to isavuconazole. However, the clinical relevance of these MICs 
cannot be derived from these data only.

In vivo efficacy was assessed in neutropenic and diabetic ketoacidotic (DKA) mouse models using 
intratracheal infection with R. oryzae 99-880 and treatment with isavuconazole 43, 59, and 116 mg/kg orally 
TID starting at 8 h for 5 days. The 116 mg/kg group had significantly (p <0.05) higher 21-day survival rates 
vs. placebo (70% vs. 10%). Isavuconazole was as effective as LAmB in treating pulmonary mucormycosis 
infections with R. oryzae in neutropenic mice. After 21 days, the survival rates for isavuconazole-, LAmB-, 
and placebo-treated mice were 65%, 40%, and 15%, respectively. Isavuconazole decreased lung and brain 
fungal burden by approximately one log compared with the placebo group. A similar decrease in lung and 
brain was noted in the LAmB-treated animals. 
The relevance of these animal models for the use of isavuconazole in clinical practice remains however 
uncertain. 
In study 9766-CL-0103 19 baseline organisms of the Mucorales order were tested for susceptibility. The most 
common species isolates were Rhizopus oryzae (9), followed by Rhizomucor pusillus (3) and Lichtheimia 
(Absidia) corymbifera (3). Overall, isavuconazole MIC values ranged from 0.25 to 32 mg/L (CLSI and 
EUCAST). The EUCAST MIC range values for isavuconazole are shown in the following table. 
Isavuconazole MIC values for Mucorales were considerably higher than for Aspergillus spp., which is 
considered problematic in the treatment of mucormycosis.

AmB:  amphotericin  B;  CAS:  caspofungin;  CLSI:  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute;  ISA:  isavuconazole;  MIC:  minimum  inhibitory 
concentration; mITT: modified intent-to-treat; POS: posaconazole; ULOQ: upperlimit of quantification; VOR: voriconazole. 
mITT: All ITT patients who have proven or probable invasive fungal disease as determined by the data review committee. 
If a MIC value is reported as >ULOQ, then the MIC value is imputed as single two-fold dilution above the ULOQ. 
† The MIC50 and MIC90 are not reported if the number of isolates is less than 10. 
‡ Sensitivities to CAS are measured as minimum effective concentrations (MEC). 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Aspergillus 
Probability of target attainment analysis (PTA) was estimated for a range of MICs using Monte Carlo 
simulations, taking into account the mean population estimates from the best 2-compartment model with 
covariates. Concentration-time profiles (n=5000) were simulated to steady state based on the phase 3 
regimen (200 mg q8h for 48 h and then QD). The total drug AUC/MIC targets estimated in the non-clinical 
models ranged from 11.2 to 503 when MICs were based on CLSI methodology and from 11.4 to 24.7 when 
based on EUCAST methodology. The above suggested that the phase 3 regimen would suffice to treat 
Aspergillus spp. with MICs up to 1 mg/L under CLSI methodology and 2 mg/L under EUCAST methodology.  
Exposure-response analyses were based on data from 232 patients with aspergillosis who were treated with 
isavuconazole in the phase 3 study 9766-CL-0104. Separate models were developed for mortality at day 42, 
DRC adjudicated overall response at EOT and DRC adjudicated clinical response at EOT for both ITT and mITT 
populations. Mortality was modelled as a binary outcome; the overall and the clinical responses were 
modelled as ordinal and also as binary responses. 
AUC, concentration at steady state, concentration at day 7, concentration at day 14 and concentration after 
loading dose were the PK parameters analysed against efficacy endpoints. None of these primary exposure 
parameters were found to be statistically significant for any of the efficacy endpoints.  
The applicant concluded that the absence of any relationship between exposure and response indicated that 
patients had plasma levels above the AUC/MIC breakpoint and factors other than exposure had a greater

impact on response than exposure to isavuconazole.  Modelling confirmed that in the phase 3 population, 
exposures were adequate to treat organisms seen in the studies.  Lack of association between exposure and 
response would be expected if exposures exceed the AUC/MIC target for organisms within the wild type 
population with MIC90 of 1 or 2 mg/L for Aspergillus species. 
During the procedure, EUCAST has recommended and CHMP has endorsed the following clinical breakpoints 
for Aspergillus species that were included in SmPC section 5.1: 
  Aspergillus fumigatus: 
  Aspergillus nidulans: 
  Aspergillus terreus: 
 S ≤ 1 mg/L,  
 S ≤ 0.25 mg/L, 
 S ≤ 1 mg/L,  
R > 1 mg/L  
R > 0.25 mg/L 
R > 1 mg/L 
S=susceptible, R=resistant 
There are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for other Aspergillus species. 
Mucorales 
Positive cultures and MIC testing results were available for Mucorales from only fifteen patients. Of the 
patients that were infected with pathogens with MICs of ≤ 4mg/L, 5 out of 7 (71%) had a 
complete/partial/stable response and in 2 out of 7 (29%) patients fungal disease progressed. Of the patients 
that were infected with pathogens with MICs of ≥ 8 mg/L, 2 out of 8 (25%) had a complete/partial/stable 
response and in 6/8  (75%) patients fungal disease progressed. 
In 24/37 patients fungal pathogens from the families of Mucoraceae (Genera Actinomucor, Mucor, 
Rhizomucor and Rhizopus), Cunninghamellaceae (Genus Cunninghamella) and Lichtheimiaceae (Genus 
Lichtheimia [former Absidia]) were identified. The most common pathogen was Rhizopus oryzae (7/24, 
29%). Other pathogenes identified were Mucor NOS (5), Rhizomucor pusillus (4), Lichtheimia corymbifera 
(2), Rhizopus azygosporus (1), Rhizopus microsporus (1), Rhizomucor (1), Mucor amphibiorum (1), 
Actinomucor elegans (1), Cunninghamella (1).  
From the available data, no clear relationship appears evident between fungal species and clinical outcome. 
In case of the patients infected with the most common identified species Rhizopus oryzae, 4/7 failed on 
isavuconazole therapy, while 2/7 cured completely and 1/7 cured partial. The four patients infected by 
Rhizomucor pusillus all failed on therapy. MICs of Rhizomucor pusillus identified in study 9766-CL-0103 
(n=4) were considerably higher than those reported in the tables presenting the data of Arendrup (2015) and 
Cuenca Estrella (2015).  
No recommendations for clinical breakpoints for Mucorales species were made by EUCAST. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Isavuconazole produced a limited blockade of the hERG potassium channels in vitro (IC50 = 5.82 ìM or 2.55 
ìg/mL = 49-fold unbound Cmax at steady state with 200 mg QD), which is similar to the IC50 for 
ketoconazole (5.46 ìM). 
A QT study was conducted in 161 subjects aged 18-55 years as follows:

Table 8  
Dose regimen by treatment group 
On days -2, -1 and 13 a continuous ECG was recorded for ~24 h. ECGs extracted on days -1 and 13 were 
measured automatically with a manual over-read by a trained reader at a central ECG laboratory in a blinded 
manner. Blood PK samples were collected on days 11 and 12 (within 15 minutes pre-dose) and then on day 
13 pre-dose [0 hour] and at timed intervals up to 24 h post-dose. Moxifloxacin was assayed in samples 
obtained at these same times on day 13.   
Of 161 healthy subjects enrolled, 148 (91.9%) completed the study and were included in the ECG analysis. 
On day 13 the mean Cmax and AUC24 were higher in the 600 mg vs. 200 mg isavuconazole group compared 
to the 200 mg isavuconazole treatment group. Trough levels on days 11-13 showed that isavuconazole was 
approaching steady state.  
For the isavuconazole 200 mg and 600 mg treatment groups, the mean change from placebo baseline-
adjusted in QTcF decreased by 9 to 13 ms and by 19 to 25 ms, respectively, within 1 h and 24 h post-dose. 
The assay sensitivity was assessed at 2 h (median tmax for moxifloxacin) at which time the effect size was 
11.03 ms with a lower bound of 7.14 ms. The lower bound of the maximum treatment difference between 
placebo and moxifloxacin at the nominal assessment time was > 5 ms, so assay sensitivity was confirmed. 
No subjects had QTcF > 450 ms or an increase from baseline >30 ms in the isavuconazole groups. Decreases 
from baseline in QTcF > 30 ms were observed in 13 (40.6%) in the 600 mg group and in 7 (18.9%) in the 
200 mg group vs. one (2.6%) subject in the placebo group. No subjects had an increase or decrease from 
baseline in QTcF > 60 ms on day 13.

It was concluded that multiple doses of 200 mg and 600 mg isavuconazole did not prolong the QTcF interval. 
There was a negative relationship between ddQTcF and isavuconazole plasma concentrations with predicted 
mean ddQTcF at Cmax for the 200 mg and 600 mg treatment groups of -13.84 and -26.80, respectively. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The absolute bioavailability of the oral formulation is 98%. Compared to that obtained after i.v. 
administration (500ml/2h) the isavuconazole Cmax after oral administration is about 22% lower, which is 
considered not clinically relevant. Based upon comparable exposures after oral and i.v. administration, both 
formulations can be interchanged. Moreover, food did not affect isavuconazole exposure, so it can be taken 
with or without food. A high distribution volume is observed (about 450 litres), indicating that isavuconazole 
is well distributed. Isavuconazole is extensively metabolized, however, it is a low clearance medicine and in 
plasma, exposure accounted mainly for intact drug. In addition, applying a loading dose of 200 mg t.i.d. for 2 
days, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg q.d. resulted in a rapid achievement of steady state at day 
3 and high trough levels of around and above 3 µg/ml. The trough values were above the targeted clinical 
MIC values of 1-2 µg/ml of especially Aspergillus. For Mucorales higher levels seems to be needed. However, 
a dose–response relationship for both was not identified (see section on pharmacodynamics).  
Renal impairment had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole and as such it can be given to 
this patient group without a need to adjust the dose. In patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment 
clearance after i.v. administration decreased by 30 and 50%, respectively, resulting in increased exposures 
of about 60 and 120%. After oral dosing, comparable results were observed. No dose adjustment is 
necessary, but an increase in AEs may be expected due to the increased exposure. There is no clinical 
experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Therefore the Cresemba SmPC 
indicates that the isavuconazole use in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is 
considered to outweigh the risks.  
With regard to interactions, the isavuconazole PK is mainly affected by inhibition and induction of CYP3A4. 
The strong inhibitor ketoconazole increased isavuconazole exposure more than 5-fold, and is contraindicated. 
The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, increased the plasma exposure of isavuconazole by about 2-
fold, therefore no dose adjustment is necessary, however caution is advised. This recommendation is also 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 73/162 
 
  
  
 
 
applicable to other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, as they are considered to have a similar or a less potent CYP3A4 
inhibition compared to lopinavir/ritonavir. Inducers may decrease plasma exposure to a great extent. As 
such, strong and moderate inducers are contraindicated, and mild inducers should be avoided unless the 
benefit outweighs the risk. Moreover, isavuconazole mainly affect CYP3A4 substrates (increase, but also 
decreases observed), CYP2B6 substrates (decreases due to induction), UGT substrates (decreases due to 
induction), BCRP substrates (increase due to inhibition) and P-gp substrates (increases due to inhibition) 
resulting in warnings. In general the interaction potential is sufficient elucidated.  
In comparison to voriconazole, isavuconazole is more sensitive for CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, both increase 
CYP3A4 substrates, but voriconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor whereas isavuconazole is a moderate 
inhibitor. Both increase tacrolimus levels to the same extent, i.e. about 2.2-fold. With regard to CYP2B6 and 
UGT substrates, isavuconazole is less favorable, as being an inducer of these substrates.   
Pharmacodynamics 
The mechanism of action is that of other triazoles. The selectivity ratio for isavuconazole was similar to that 
reported for voriconazole, indicating that it will likely have moderate inhibitory activity against the human 
P450 enzyme with attendant implications for the safety profile. 
Invasive aspergillosis 
MIC breakpoint and probability of target attainment analysis (Aspergillus spp.) 
In the dose fractionation experiments, the AUC/MIC targets for Aspergillus spp. were described as total drug 
ratios (median 503 for stasis and 1111 for 1-log kill). The PTA was estimated based on this AUC/MIC ratio of 
503 for stasis and based on alternative targets derived from other in-vivo studies as well as from an in-vitro 
model with reduction in galactomannan to < 1 as an endpoint.  
It was unknown why the focus was on the total drug and not on the free drug, but the applicant has 
adequately explained the reasons for using total drug concentration for PK/PD analyses. The precision of the 
validated method does not allow sufficient differentiation between the average free fractions of 1.05% and 
0.74% (1.4-fold) in mouse and human plasma, respectively. 
PTA was estimated based on these (very) different targets and separately for EUCAST vs. CLSI MICs and the 
results were very different for CLSI MICs using the three targets assessed, such that the PTA would suggest 
that the highest treatable MIC could be anywhere from 0.06 to 4 µg/mL. The applicant has explained the 
differences between the three models (one in vitro and 2 in vivo), but it was considered that this did not 
really address which model provided the most relevant PD target. It was also not accepted that the 
neutropenic mouse overestimated the PD target. Generally speaking the PK/PD analyses were deemed of a 
rather poor quality and although the efficacy in the treatment of aspergillosis is recognised, it could not be 
excluded that a different dose regimen could have provided even better results. CHMP agreed nevertheless 
that this issue should not be further pursued and should be considered resolved. 
The exposure-response analyses are based on PK samples from the very small PK sub-population, which 
means that there was inadequate sampling in the study for exposure-response analyses. As a result of these 
inadequate attempts to characterise the PK/PD relationship, the selection of the final dose regimen tested in 
phase 3 could only really be supported by the PK properties of isavuconazole and by the rather crude 
comparisons between plasma levels and MICs. 
From the 8 patients infected with Aspergillus with elevated MICs to isavuconazole (≥  8 mg/L) and who failed 
to isavuconazole therapy, all presented trough values below 8 mg/l total drug concentration. The average 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 74/162 
 
  
  
isavuconazole plasma trough level is approximately 4 mg/L, however, the data suggest a strong inter-
individual variation with regard to trough levels, even after 14 and 42 days of treatment. 
During the procedure, EUCAST has recommended and CHMP has endorsed the following clinical breakpoints 
for Aspergillus species that were included in SmPC section 5.1: 
  Aspergillus fumigatus: 
  Aspergillus nidulans: 
  Aspergillus terreus: 
 S ≤ 1 mg/L,  
 S ≤ 0.25 mg/L, 
 S ≤ 1 mg/L,  
R > 1 mg/L  
R > 0.25 mg/L 
R > 1 mg/L 
S=susceptible, R=resistant 
There are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for other Aspergillus species. 
The association of azole trough levels and clinical response has been discussed at length in the international 
literature and it is generally agreed that the dose-response relation for azoles is complex and ambiguous. 
Experimental PD models were performed to establish the exposure-response relationship associated with 
efficacy (PD index) and the target exposure was estimated and associated with the optimal exposure-
response (E-R) relationship (PD target). For isavuconazole, the PD index suggested to be associated with 
efficacy as AUC/MIC [Lepak, et. al 2013]. For isavuconazole, Monte Carlo simulations have shown PTA of 
95% for Aspergillus fumigatus with MICs that are common in the wild type isolates and below the 
epidemiological cut off values, which gives some support for probability of efficacy.  
MIC breakpoint and probability of target attainment analysis (Mucorales) 
Pharmacodynamic studies for the assessment of PD targets and indices have not been established for 
Mucorales organisms and MIC data from patients in the clinical trials are sparse. In addition, epidemiological 
cut-off values (ECVs) for organisms of the Mucorales order have not been established to date. Therefore, it is 
not possible to establish clinical interpretive breakpoints for organisms of the Mucorales order at this time. 
In this context it is pertinent to note that isavuconazole demonstrates variable in vitro activity against 
individual species of the Aspergillus genus and against isolates of the Mucorales order (Absidia spp., 
Cunninghamella spp., Mucor spp., Rhizomucor spp. and Rhizopus spp.). Using the CLSI methodology the 
isavuconazole MIC50 and MIC90 against Aspergillus spp. were 1 and 4 µg/mL, respectively, with a range from 
0.12-32 µg/mL. Among the Mucorales isavuconazole was most active against Rhizomucor and Rhizopus, for 
which the MIC90 was 4–16 µg/mL, and least active against Cunninghamella spp. (MIC90: 16–32 µg/mL).  
The applicant has submitted additional MIC data on Mucorales (source: Arendrup 2015 and Cuenca Estrella 
2015). Although the MIC pattern presented within the initial application was generally in line with the MIC 
pattern reported by Arendrup 2015 and Cuenca Estrella 2015, the MICs in the original application were 
generally considerably higher. 
In study 9766-CL-0103 there were 22 isolates of the Mucorales order tested for susceptibility, including 
Rhizopus oryzae (10), Rhizomucor pusillus (5) and Lichtheimia (Absidia) corymbifera (3). The MIC values 
ranged from 0.25 to 32 µg/mL, with similar results using CLSI and EUCAST methods. This variability is an 
important issue to consider, especially with regard to a claim for treatment of mucormycosis.  
It is claimed in the clinical study report of study 9766-CL-0103 that successful outcomes were seen for 
organisms with MIC values as high as 8 µg/mL. This claim is not applicable to the organisms of interest. 
Specifically for Mucorales, CLSI MICs were compared to outcomes only for 3 Lichtheimia spp. (2 clinical and 3 
microbiological failures; all MICs 8 µg/mL or more), 1 Mucor spp. (failure; MIC > 8 µg/mL), 3 Rhizomucor 
spp. (2 clinical and 3 microbiological failures; all MICs 8 µg/mL or more) and 11 Rhizopus spp. (10 clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 75/162 
 
  
  
 
 
 
failures and 8 microbiological failures; MICs from 0.5 to >8 µg/mL). The results based on EUCAST MICs were 
the same. With the currently recommended posology of isavuconazole, the average isavuconazole plasma 
trough level is approximately 4 µg/mL (phase 3 clinical studies 9766-CL-0103 and 9766-CL-0104). It is 
therefore expected that plasma levels will be attained that are above the EUCAST MIC of only a few 
Mucorales species.  
The CHMP agreed that the applicant’s proposal to apply a threshold trough level of 4 mg/L isavuconazole to 
determine the coverage of isavuconazole against Mucorales species in study 9766-CL-0103 was not 
acceptable. It was concluded that there was no clear relationship between the MIC of isavuconazole and 
clinical succes/failure in mucormycosis. Moreover the sparse available MIC values of pathogens in study 
9766-CL-0103 were considerable higher (up to 32 µg/mL) when compared to those observed in the 
epidemiology studies (Arendrup 2015, Cuenca Estrella 2015). Since no dose response study was performed 
in mucormycosis, CHMP agreed that no recommendations with regard to any target trough levels could be 
made. The limitations of the clinical and in vitro data on Mucorales species are being described in the SmPC 
sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
Resistance development 
Several mechanisms of resistance have been described for the triazole class of antifungals, including 
mutations in the CYP51A gene that leads to alterations in the target enzyme (14-α-sterol-demethylase), 
upregulation of efflux pumps and mutations in the promoter region of CYP51A which leads to overexpression 
of the protein product.  
A total of eighteen isolates collected from the phase 3 studies (9766-CL-0104 and 9766-CL-0103) of which 
15 with elevated MICs to isavuconazole (≥ 8 mg/L) and 3 wild-type organisms from each genus for 
comparison were tested to identify the presence of any of the classic triazole resistance mechanisms [study 
9766-PH-0127]. The results indicated that the mechanisms underlying the increased MIC to isavuconazole 
are similar to those observed for other triazoles in Rhizopus, Fusarium and Aspergillus isolates. These 
organisms exhibiting reduced susceptibility to isavuconazole also showed elevated MICs to most other azoles 
that were tested, suggesting cross-resistance can occur among these azoles. The SmPC is mentioning the 
possibility of cross-resistance in section 5.1. 
The applicant was requested to provide a detailed analysis of underlying resistance mechanisms, including 
development of point mutations known to be associated with triazole resistance development, in addition to 
efflux mechanisms and to incorporate data on cross resistance between isavuconazole and voriconazole into 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. The applicant clarified that the resistance mechanisms are likely to be similar to 
azoles in general, particularly with cyp51A and cyp51B gene mutations being most relevant. 
Two patients from the 2 studies had baseline and follow up MICs available for what was potentially the same 
isolate. In both cases MIC increased with at least 2 dilution steps. The applicant was asked to describe these 
patients in details, especially with regard to possible mechanisms of resistance development. From the data 
provided, it was not possible to draw any conclusions on the risk for selection of reduced susceptibility to 
isavuconazole from the available data. An appropriate proposal for the monitoring of resistance to 
isavuconazole in the post-approval period was included in the risk management plan. 
Secondary Pharmacology

adequately.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Regarding pharmacodynamics  
Aspergillus 
For isavuconazole, the PD index suggested to be associated with efficacy as AUC/MIC like for most azoles. 
Monte Carlo simulations have shown a PTA of 95% for Aspergillus fumigatus with MICs that are common in 
the wild type isolates and below the epidemiological cut-off values. As for other azoles, the dose-response 
relation for isavuconazole is complex. The efficacy results of the comparative phase 3 study 9766-CL-0104 
versus voriconazole are however taken into consideration.  
EUCAST has recommended clinical breakpoints for Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus 
terreus. There are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for other Aspergillus species. The 
CHMP endorsed the EUCAST recommendations. 
Mucorales 
It was concluded that the available microbiological data were inadequate to support a conclusion that 
isavuconazole, when used at the proposed posology, is suitable for the treatment of all Mucorales species. 
Moreover, the data suggested that some of the genera/species may be inherently insusceptible to 
isavuconazole. A pathogen-specific indication was not acceptable either. Further qualifications in sections 4.4 
and 5.1 in the SmPC were implemented. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Four clinical studies were performed. This application is mainly based on the results from two pivotal clinical 
trials, 9766-CL-0104 (invasive aspergillosis) and 9766-CL-0103 (mucormycosis):

Phase 2 study 9766-CL-0101 was conducted in “uncomplicated oesophageal candidiasis” patients and study 
9766-CL-0102 in “prophylaxis of patients undergoing chemotherapy for AML” patients; these studies are 
therefore considered as supportive only (for safety).  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No formal dose-response studies were conducted in support of any of the sought indications. The proposed 
dosing regimen was merely based on in vitro MIC data and on non-clinical studies in neutropenic rats and 
mice. Further considerations were to maximize both the exposure to isavuconazole (AUC/MIC) and the trough 
levels to recommend the dosage to be administered daily and not intermittently. To achieve steady-state 
levels more rapidly (e.g. within 3 to 4 days), a loading dose regimen on days 1 and 2 was administered. A 
minimum infusion duration of 1 hour (1.5 to 2 hours in this study to match the comparator) was 
recommended to minimize the risk of local intolerance at the injection site. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Title of Study 
Study 9766-CL-0104 A phase III, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate safety and efficacy of 
isavuconazole (BAL8557) versus voriconazole for primary treatment of invasive fungal disease caused by 
Aspergillus species or otherfilamentous fungi (the SECURE Study) 
Methods 
Study 9766-CL-0104 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority, active-controlled study 
(versus voriconazole), which randomized 527 adult patients with proven, probable, or possible IFD caused by 
Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi. Stratification factors included geographic region, allogeneic 
bone marrow transplant (BMT) status and uncontrolled malignancy status.  
The chosen NI design (demonstration of non-inferiority towards a reference drug) is considered acceptable by 
CHMP and in line with the CHMP Guidance on antifungal agents (CHMP/EWP/1343, 2010). Voriconazole is a 
well-established comparator and the preferred antifungal drug in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years, including females not at risk of pregnancy, and had proven, probable 
or possible IFD caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi. The EORTC/MWG definitions were 
applied. 
If invasive diagnostic procedures were not successful in establishing the diagnosis or were not possible, a 
serum galactomannan [GM; Platelia Aspergillus EIA] single value ≥ 0.7 or two consecutive values ≥ 0.5 - < 
0.7 were considered as acceptable mycological evidence for the enrolment as probable IFD (except in 
patients receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam or Plasma-Lyte™). GM in BAL, pleural fluid 
or cerebrospinal fluid was not acceptable for enrolment, except for those cases with two BAL GM values ≥ 1.0 
(2 aliquots of the same sample), which were enrolled as possible IFD. Other diagnostic tests (e.g. PCR or β-
D-glucan) were not acceptable for determining patient eligibility. 
Important exclusions included: 


prolong the QT/QTc interval

Due to the restrictions on the use of i.v. voriconazole in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, 
related to the presence of a cyclodextrin excipient, the study excluded renally impaired patients (estimated 
creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min). Supportive evidence on the efficacy of isavuconazole in these patients is 
provided by study 9766-CL-0103 (mucormycosis), which enrolled a subpopulation of renally impaired 
patients with invasive aspergillosis. 
Treatments  
The study treatment schedule included i.v. loading doses for 1-2 days followed by i.v. infusion or oral 
capsules for maintenance treatment until EOT. Isavuconazole was administered in loading dose of 200 mg 
every 8 hours i.v. for 2 days (6 doses) followed by a maintenance dose of 200mg i.v. or p.o. daily. 
Voriconazole was administered in a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours i.v. for one day (2 doses) 
followed by a maintenance regime of 4 mg/kg i.v. or 200 mg orally every 12 hours. 
Study 9766-CL-0104 precluded the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to adjust for the voriconazole 
dose. The applicant was asked to discuss the implications of this for the overall efficacy/safety comparison in 
study 9766-CL-104, in particular to discuss the efficacy observed with voriconazole for the subsets that did 
and did not undergo an early switch from iv to p.o voriconazole. From the applicant’s response it was 
understood that patients that switched early to oral treatment (≤ Day 7) had a better prognosis than patients 
who did not. A detailed reanalysis of the efficacy and safety data based on proxy variables which may have 
affected the drug levels of voriconazole (such as BMI and ethnicity) did not suggest any confounding of the 
main study outcomes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 79/162 
 
  
  
Therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole (and posaconazole) has been described in recent published 
literature (Pascual A. 20121. Park WB, 20122 and (Ashbee HR 20143). Whether or not voriconazole was used 
suboptimal in part of the patients, remains unclear. However, also patients treated with isavuconazole could 
theoretically benefit from TDM. The reasons of the applicant not to consider TDM at the time of the conduct 
of pivotal study 9766-CL-004 (in 2006), “since TDM was not well established yet” and “TDM of voriconazole 
would potentially have jeopardised the blinding of the study” are considered understandable and acceptable 
by CHMP. 
The switch from i.v. to oral administration of study drug was to be made as early as possible from day 3 
onward. Patients remained on therapy until they had reached a treatment endpoint or until they had received 
treatment for a maximum period of 84 days. Treatment was to continue for at least 7 days after resolution of 
all clinical symptoms and physical findings of infection. Non-study systemic antifungal medication is allowed 
only after the day 42 visit, unless the patient is a failure prior to the day 42 visit. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare all-cause mortality through day 42 following primary 
treatment with isavuconazole versus voriconazole in patients with IFD caused by Aspergillus species or other 
filamentous fungi.  
The secondary objectives of the study were to characterize the safety and tolerability while assessing 
additional efficacy of treatment with isavuconazole versus voriconazole. 
Exploratory objectives were to summarize the concentration-time profiles and to characterize 
pharmacokinetic trough values of isavuconazole and metabolite(s) in patients from a pharmacokinetic (PK) 
substudy.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was crude rate of all-cause mortality through day 42 in the ITT-Population.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints were DRC-assessed overall response at EOT (key secondary analysis) and at 
days 42 and 84, all-cause mortality through day 84, DRC attribution of mortality to IFD, investigator 
assessment of clinical, mycological and radiological response, impact of the use of potentially mould active 
systemic antifungal therapy (AFT), and the results of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing. 
All-cause mortality through day 42 in the ITT population was further analyzed for the various intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors including several subgroups (age, gender, race, ethnicity, BMI, eGFR-MDRD category and 
neutropenia) and by stratification factors relating to underlying disease (i.e. uncontrolled malignancy versus 
allogeneic BMT/HSCT) which is considered appropriate. The reason for stratification by region was based on 
the similarities in the health care systems and the provision of standard of care. 
The applicant’s choice of having mortality as the primary endpoint was criticized during several scientific 
advices as it was not considered in accordance with the Guideline on the clinical evaluation of antifungal 
agents for the treatment and prophylaxis of invasive fungal disease (CHMP/EWP/1343/01 Rev 1, 2010) which 
recommends “overall clinical response” as the primary outcome measure. Mortality may result from causes 
unrelated to IFD in these severe ill patients and attribution of mortality associated with IFD is very difficult in

these medically complex cases. For this reason “DRC-assessed overall response at EOT” was proposed as the 
key efficacy endpoint for the CHMP. 
“DRC-assessed overall response at EOT (in mITT-Population)” is a combined endpoint of clinical, mycological 
and radiological responses at EOT. Study data were independently assessed by a blinded Drug Review 
Committee (DRC) consisting of experts in IFD that provided an independent adjudication of each patient’s 
IFD at enrolment, responses at EOT, day 42 and day 84 and attributable mortality. Review of patient data by 
the DRC was in the form of patient profiles and did not include the investigator assessments or AEs. 
Independent radiology experts provided a qualitative assessment of images, including location of infection, 
characteristics of LRTD and an overall outcome assessment of percent improvement from baseline at EOT, 
day 42 and day 84. These data were included in the patient data reviewed by the DRC. The criteria used to 
assess if a patient had proven, probable or possible IFD at entry of the study were fully in line with the 
consensus criteria of EORTC/MSG.  
Treatment “success” was defined as complete response or partial response. 
Treatment “failure” was defined as stable response or progression of IFD. Patients who were missing or not 
evaluable at the endpoint were considered failures. This conservative approach is endorsed.  
 
The most important populations for the assessment of efficacy are considered the Modified Intent-to-
Treat  (mITT)  population  which  consists  of  the  ITT  patients  with  proven  or  probable  invasive  fungal 
disease  as  determined  by  DRC  and  the  Mycological  Intent-to-Treat  (myITT).  The  myITT  consist  of 
mITT patients with the following pathogen causing invasive fungal disease (IFD) as assessed by DRC:  
  Aspergillus species only, or 
  Aspergillus species plus other mould species, or 
  No  pathogen  (identified  by  the  DRC  for  those  patients  with  aspergillosis  with  only  serum  GM  as 
mycological evidence). 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on all-cause mortality through day 42. Approximately 255 patients per 
group were to be enrolled to ensure at least 80% power to demonstrate that the upper bound of the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for a treatment difference in favour of the comparator was no larger than 10% (see 
below). This was based on a one-sided, large sample, normal approximation and non-inferiority test at a 
2.5% significance level. It was also assumed that both voriconazole and isavuconazole would have a 20% 
mortality rate in the primary efficacy population. The methods for analysis of the primary endpoint were 
considered appropriate. 
Randomisation 
In this study, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either isavuconazole or voriconazole. 
Blinding (masking) 
The sponsor, clinical research organization (CRO) staff, investigators, patient and study coordinator(s) were 
blinded to randomization of study drug. 
Statistical methods 
For the primary endpoint “all-cause mortality through day 42”, the protocol pre-specified non-inferiority 
margin (NIM) value was 10% and was based on the sponsor’s meta-analysis. In the absence of historical 
Assessment report

Page 81/162 
 
  
  
placebo-controlled data, the meta-analysis estimated that all-cause mortality through day 42 in untreated 
patients was 84.8% (95% CI 75.1%, 94.5%). This estimation was supported by a mortality rate of 100% in 
untreated patients reported by Denning [1996]. The historical all-cause mortality rate through day 42 for 
voriconazole was 18.8% (95% CI 12.4%, 25.1%) based on Herbrecht et al., 2002. A conservative estimate 
of M1 for voriconazole vs. placebo for all-cause mortality through day 42 was 50.0%. On this basis the 
sponsor considered that the 10% NIM provided statistically robust evidence that isavuconazole was superior 
to placebo and preserved > 80% of the voriconazole treatment effect.

An overall high number of protocol violations were reported. The overall number of patients who prematurely 
discontinued treatment was similar between the two treatment groups: isavuconazole 140/258 (54.3%) 
versus voriconazole 138/258 (53.5%). 
The 3 most common reasons for discontinuation of treatment were intercurrent illness, insufficient 
therapeutic response and death. Differences were observed between treatment groups for two of the 
categories. The number of patients who discontinued treatment primarily due to adverse events/intercurrent 
illness was lower in the isavuconazole treatment group (31/258, 12.0%) than in the voriconazole treatment 
group (53/258, 20.5%). The number of patients who discontinued treatment primarily due to an insufficient 
therapeutic response, as assessed by the investigator, was however higher in the isavuconazole treatment 
group (39/258, 15.1%) than in the voriconazole treatment group (23/258, 8.9%).  
In addition, more patients in the isavuconazole treated group died from infections and infestations 
isavuconazole: 28/257 (10.9%) vs voriconazole: 18/259 (6.9%). Study drug-related TEAE leading to death 
encompassed 3 patients that died due to “(fungal) infections and infestations” and all were isavuconazole 
treated.

The treatment discontinuation rates in the myITT population were high, but no imbalances between the two 
treatment groups (isavuconazole and voriconazole) were noticed. Also the study drug duration in the myITT 
analysis set was comparable between the two groups. 
In addition to the analysis sets shown below, there were 468 patients in the ITT-excluding no IFD population 
(i.e. after excluding those DRC-assessed as not having proven, probable or possible IFD).

Patient Disposition and Analysis Sets 
The DRC identified 272 (52.7%) mITT patients (proven or probable IFD) vs. 280 (54.3%) according to the 
investigators. An overall concordance between the two datasets was observed for 420 (81.4%) patients. The 
DRC determined that most patients had IFD in the LRTD only (81.1% isavuconazole and 82.9% 
voriconazole). 
The DRC reported that no pathogen was identified in 140/272 (51.5%) of the mITT population (i.e. they were 
included based only on GM results). Among the pathogens found on culture or histology, the most common 
was Aspergillus fumigatus. The DRC assessed 231/272 in the mITT population as having invasive 
aspergillosis and 139 of these 231 cases were based on GM only-see below table:

The applicant confirmed the DRC-assigned level of certainty of diagnosis taking into account the centralised 
laboratory galactomannan results as well as local testing results. Given the nature of galactomannan test and 
its place in the diagnostic work-up this is considered acceptable by CHMP.  
The treatment groups were balanced for demographics and baseline characteristics of ITT Population as 
shown in the following table:

Table  16 
Demographics and Baseline characteristics of ITT population (9766-CL-0104) 
The primary underlying diseases were leukaemias and lymphomas, but the diagnostic categories were not 
well balanced between treatment groups in most cases. Baseline isolated pathogens were evenly distributed 
over both treatment groups. There were no relevant differences for any prior and concomitant medication 
between treatment and no relevant differences in the mITT population compared to the ITT population. 
Baseline demographic and underlying disease distributions were also presented for the myITT population. 
From the submitted data, it is concluded that the baseline demographic characteristics for the myITT- 
population were generally well balanced, as presented in the following table:

Table  17 
Study 9766-CL-0104:Demographic characteristics (mITT and myITT analysis sets) 
The only exceptions were the imbalances in gender (slightly more women in the isavuconazole group than in 
the voriconazole group) and in race (considerably less Asian patients in the isavuconazole group than in the 
voriconazole group). These imbalances however are not considered to have influenced the overall clinical 
outcome of pivotal study 9766-CL-0104. There were no clinically relevant differences between the two 
treatment groups for the stratification factors (geographic region, allogeneic BMT/HSCT, and uncontrolled 
malignancy). 
Numbers analysed 
The different analysis sets used in this study are described below: 
 
The ITT population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one administration of 
study drug. For this population, data were analysed by the treatment group that patients were 
randomized to even though they might not be compliant with the protocol or assigned treatment. 
 
The modified ITT (mITT) population consisted of ITT patients who had proven or probable IFD as 
determined by the DRC. Patients with appropriate host factor and clinical features were considered to

aspergillosis based on cytology, histology, culture or GMc set forth in the protocol and assessed by 
the DRC. 
 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) was a subset of ITT (PPS-ITT) or a subset of mITT (PPS-mITT) patients 
who did not deviate from the pre-specified Classification Criteria. 
 
The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKAS) consisted of a subset of the SAF population who had at least 
one isavuconazole plasma concentration. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results for primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary objective of demonstrating non-inferiority of isavuconazole relative to voriconazole for the 
primary endpoint “all-cause mortality through day 42 in the ITT population” was met, with the upper bound 
of the 95% CI of 5.7% around the adjusted treatment difference (isavuconazole - voriconazole: -1.0%) being 
lower than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 10%.

The sensitivity analysis using a minimum-risk method for all-cause mortality through day 42 gave almost 
identical results and a post hoc analysis without stratification factors gave 95% CI around the treatment 
difference (isavuconazole-voriconazole: -1.6%) of (-8.771%, 5.670%). Also across the analysis populations 
the all-cause mortality through day 42 gave adjusted treatment differences in the range -5.1% to -1.3% and 
upper bounds of the 95% CIs that ranged from 5.024% to 7.215%.

Table  19 
All-cause Mortality Through day 42 for Various Populations in study 9766-CL-0104  
In the myITT population all-cause mortality through day 42 was consistent with that of the other populations. 
In the subset with probable Aspergillus by GM only and those with Aspergillus only or Aspergillus plus other 
moulds the all-cause mortality was consistently numerically lower in the isavuconazole group. 
Table  20 
All-cause Mortality Through day 42 (myITT Population and Subjects) in study 9766-
CL-0104 
All-cause mortality through day 42 in the ITT population was further analyzed for the various intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors, including the 3 stratification factors (geographic region, allogeneic BMT and uncontrolled 
malignancy) and in several subgroups (age, gender, race, ethnicity, BMI, eGFR-MDRD category and 
neutropenia). Overall no significant differences were observed for the different subgroups. However, the 
mortality in the regions “Western Europe” and “Europe” was numerically lower than in “Other regions”, and 
applicant was asked to explain this finding. 
An overview of Day 42 all-cause mortality by region is listed in the following table:

Table  21

Europe/Europe and Other Regions  
There were differences in mortality rates between the regions. A review of the demographic data submitted 
by the applicant revealed no substantial differences that could explain the higher mortality rates in India and 
South Korea. CHMP agreed with the applicant that the numbers of patients enrolled in these two countries 
were rather low and that the broad geographic distribution and the larger number of countries in other 
regions could have contributed to the wider variability in outcomes. 
All-cause mortality through day 84 across the various populations supports the results seen in the primary 
efficacy analysis at day 42 with 29.1% mortality in the isavuconazole group and 31.0% in the voriconazole 
group (ITT population, treatment difference, -1.4% 95%CI -9.2%-6.3%), see following table. This is also 
exemplified in the below Kaplan-Meier plot.

The majority of deaths in the isavuconazole and voriconazole treatment groups were reported to be 
associated with evidence of residual or ongoing IFD at both day 42 (22 and 25 deaths) and day 84 (38 and

The ITT-excluding no IFD population is the ITT population excluding those who were assessed by the DRC as not having adequate evidence 
of proven, probable or possible IFD. DRC: Data Review Committee, IFD:  invasive fungal disease;  ISA: isavuconazole;  ITT:  intent-to-treat; 
VRC: voriconazole. 
The ITT population did not show a marked difference in IFD attributable death. 
Efficacy results for the key secondary endpoint  
Response rates for DRC overall response at EOT for the mITT population were similar for isavuconazole and 
voriconazole treated patients (50/143, 35.0% and 47/129, 36.4%, respectively) with an adjusted treatment 
difference  of 1.6% (95%CI: -9.4%, 12.6%): 
Table 24 
DRC-assessed Overall Response at EOT (mITT Population)

The  adjusted  treatment  difference  (VRC-ISA)  was calculated by  a  stratified  CMH  method with  the  strata  of  Geographical Region, 
Allogeneic BMT Status and Uncontrolled Malignancy Status. The 95% CI for the adjusted treatment difference was calculated based 
on a normal approximation. 
BMT:  bone  marrow  transplant;  CMH:  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel;  DRC:  Data  Review  Committee;  EOT:  end  of  treatment;  ISA: 
isavuconazole; mITT: modified intent-to-treat; VRC: voriconazole. 
Complete treatment success was achieved in 17 (11.9%) and 13 (10.1%) patients in the isavuconazole and 
voriconazole treatment groups, respectively. Partial success was achieved in 33 (23.1%) and 34 (26.4%) 
patients in the isavuconazole and voriconazole treatment groups, respectively (see above table).  
DRC-assessed overall response at day 42 and EOT were similar between treatment groups, however at day 
84 the failure rate in the isavuconazole group appeared to be higher compared to the voriconazole group 
(74.8% vs 67.4%), see following table:  
Table 25 
DRC-assessed Overall Response at Day 84 (mITT Population),

The adjusted treatment difference (VRC-ISA) was calculated by a stratified CMH method with the strata of Geographical Region, Allogeneic 
BMT  Status  and  Uncontrolled  Malignancy  Status.  The  95%  CI  for  the  adjusted  treatment  difference  was  calculated  based  on  a  normal 
approximation. 
For this analysis, any visits that DRC assessed as not done were considered failures. A death before day 42 was also considered a failure at 
both day 42 and day 84, even if the DRC assessed the patient to be a success prior to death.

The DRC assessments of clinical, mycological and radiological response rates at EOT were similar between 
the treatment groups for the mITT population. The rates of success for the radiological response were low in 
both treatment groups mainly due to missing data (no post-baseline radiological assessments at EOT for ~ 
22.0% in both treatment groups).

BMT  Status  and  Uncontrolled  Malignancy  Status.  The  95%  CI  for  the  adjusted  treatment  difference  was  calculated  based  on  a  normal 
approximation. 
The DRC-assessed overall response rates at EOT for the myITT population and subsets were generally similar 
between treatment groups for patients with Aspergillus identified by histology or culture. Rates were lower 
for isavuconazole vs. voriconazole (33.8%, 24/71 vs. 41.2%, 28/68, respectively) for patients with 
Aspergillus identified by GM only-see following table: 
Table 27 
DRC-assessed Overall Response at EOT (myITT Population and Subsets), study 
9766-CL-0104  
DRC-assessed success rates at EOT were higher in isavuconazole vs. voriconazole patients in Western Europe 
but lower with isavuconazole in North America and Other Regions (see following table). Success rates for 
those who did not have uncontrolled malignancy at baseline were lower with isavuconazole. No treatment-by-
subgroup interaction was observed except for race (P = 0.085; Wald-Chi-square test). However, most 
patients were white and had similar success rates with isavuconazole vs. voriconazole. Success rates were 
numerically lower with isavuconazole in those aged > 65 years.

Asian patients had a numerically lower success rate in the isavuconazole group (25.9%, 7/27) than in the 
voriconazole treatment group (48.6%, 17/35). The applicant was requested to clarify whether there could be 
an ethnicity effect, especially taken into consideration that drug exposure to isavuconazole in healthy Chinese 
subjects (study 9766-CL-0038) appeared 15 – 50% higher compared to Western subjects. It was concluded 
that the observed differences in response rates between Asian and non-Asian patients cannot be explained by 
drug exposure. From six Asian patients MIC values were available. All MICs were however below 2 µg/mL, so 
it is considered not likely either that resistance to isavuconazole does explain the results in overall response 
at EOT. Moreover, the differences in favour of voriconazole were not consistent across the Asian countries; 
they were apparent in Thailand and South Korea (between group difference in overall response at EOT of 
34.3% in favour of voriconazole), but not in China and India (between group difference in overall response at 
EOT of 6.1% in favour of isavuconazole). Therefore a potential ethnicity effect can not be excluded at present 
and is included as missing information in the RMP.  
The results of analysis of DRC-assessed overall response at EOT by IFD location in the mITT population 
revealed some differences between the two treatment groups. Voriconazole seemed to perform better in the 
“mITT patients with LRTD plus other organ” and in “mITT patients with non-LRTD only” subgroups. However, 
these differences were probably due to some imbalances in the baseline characteristics (less localized disease 
in the isavuconazole group) but the subgroups were small, limiting any firm conclusions.  
DRC-assessed clinical responses at day 42 were isavuconazole 64% vs. voriconazole 57.5% in the myITT 
population while overall success rates were 35.8% isavuconazole vs. 38% voriconazole. At day 84, DRC-
assessed mycological (40/143, 28.0% vs. 47/129, 36.4%) and radiological response (31/141, 22.0% vs. 
38/128, 29.7%) were numerically lower in isavuconazole treated patients compared to voriconazole treated 
patients, whereas the clinical response was similar (isavuconazole: 65/141, 46.1% vs. voriconazole: 55/124, 
44.4%). 
Very few patients (isavuconazole: 3 patients and voriconazole: 1 patient) received a potentially mould active 
systemic AFT (any reason for use) up to the EOT and none achieved success for overall response (see 
following table):

Table 29  
Potentially Mould active Systemic AFT Use by Visit (study 9766-CL-0104) 
Ancillary analyses 
A post hoc analysis of all-cause mortality and overall response at day 42 and day 84 showed that the use of a 
potentially mould active systemic AFT did not confound the interpretation of the outcomes based on all-cause 
mortality and overall response (see following table). Among the patients in the mITT population who received 
potentially mould active systemic AFT, mortality rates through day 42 were similar between treatments, but 
mortality rates through day 84 were numerically lower for isavuconazole. For the patients that did not receive 
potentially mould active systemic AFT, the success rates were similar between treatment groups.

Potentially Mould active Systemic AFT Use by Visit (study 9766-CL-0104) 
There were 92 patients (52 isavuconazole and 40 voriconazole) with evidence of IFD caused by Aspergillus 
spp. (alone or with another pathogen) that was not based solely on GM. The CSR stated that there were 99 
Aspergillus spp. tested for isavuconazole susceptibility as well as 5 Fusarium spp., 4 Lichtheimia (Absidia) 
corymbifera, 2 Penicillium spp. and 1 Rhizopus oryzae. Using the CLSI methodology the isavuconazole MIC50 
and MIC90 against Aspergillus spp. were 1 and 4 mcg/mL, respectively (range 0.12 to 32 mcg/mL) (see 
following table). The lowest isavuconazole MICs were seen against A. fumigatus. The EUCAST MIC values 
were similar. At the EOT and at days 42 and 84 there were no trends in response by MIC.

Table 31 
MIC Values for Fungal Isolates per CLSI Standard (ITT Population), 
study 9766-CL-0104 
During the procedure, CHMP asked the applicant to explain the difference between the numbers of isolates 
tested and the number of patients listed as having Aspergillus not based solely on GM, to explain why 
outcomes were not presented for all patients from whom the 99 isolates tested were obtained and to show 
outcomes by MIC for myITT patients. From the applicant’s responses it appeared that the numbers were 
based on different datasets: 
- 
- 
92  patients  were  those  diagnosed  with  Aspergillus  spp.  with  or  without  other  moulds  in  the  MyITT  set, 
irrespective of isolate presence at baseline and/or follow up. 
99  reflects the number of Aspergillus spp. isolates in the ITT dataset  in  70 patients with baseline and 
post baseline isolates; 67 of these patients were part of the myITT dataset, providing 93 Aspergillus spp. 
isolates. 
The applicant has further clarified the origin of the numbers, by providing new tables presenting how patients 
and isolates from different datasets can be extrapolated from each other.  
Fifteen patients had isolates tested post-baseline (after day 7) at the central laboratory. MICs of 
isavuconazole in 5/15 were within 1 dilution step of the baseline MIC. For the other 10, the following were 
noted: 
 
One patient (isavuconazole; baseline A. fumigatus MIC 0.25 mcg/mL) received 76 days ISA and was 
 
 
 
responding at day 42 but on day 70 had worsening signs and symptoms, including radiography and 
positive GM index. A. fumigatus was isolated from a respiratory sample collected on day 70 for which 
the ISA MIC was 1 mcg/mL. The patient had received additional treatment for cancer by day 50. 
Another patient (isavuconazole) had an isolate on day 9 for which the EUCAST but not the CLSI MIC 
had increased 5 dilution steps. The MIC was back within range for isolates collected on day 43. 
Six patients had only post-baseline isolates tested with CLSI MICs from 0.25 to 4 mcg/mL. 
Two patients had MIC values from multiple fungal isolates and had a new organism isolated while on 
therapy. Both were considered failures based on DRC assessment. One of them (isavuconazole) had A. 
terreus at baseline (day -3: ISA CLSI MIC 0.5 mcg/mL) as well as A. westerdijkiae (CLSI MIC value 2 
mcg/mL). Lichtheimia corymbifera (ISA CLSI MIC 16 mcg/mL) grew on subsequent baseline cultures 
(day 6 and day 13). The second patient (voriconazole) had Fusarium fujikuroi isolated (CLSI MIC 4 
mcg/mL) on day -1 and on day 42 had a new isolate of Rhizopus oryzae (CLSI MIC > 32 mcg/mL).

Title of Study 
Study 9766-CL-0103: Open-Label Study of Isavuconazole in the Treatment of Patients with Aspergillosis 
and Renal Impairment or of Patients with Invasive Fungal Disease Caused by Rare Moulds, Yeasts or 
Dimorphic Fungi (the VITAL study) 
Methods 
Study 9766-CL-WSA-CS-0103 was a phase 3, open-label, multicentre study in which isavuconazole was 
investigated in three different patient populations. A pharmacokinetic substudy was conducted and the study 
investigated the efficacy and safety of isavuconazole in the treatment of 
-   patients with invasive fungal disease caused by rare moulds, yeasts or dimorphic fungi. 
-  
invasive aspergillosis in patients with renal impairment; 
Study Participants  
The inclusion criteria and definitions of treatment outcomes (clinical, mycological and radiological response) 
were in compliance with the recommendations of the EORTC/MSG guideline (2008). The exclusion criteria 
and criteria for the study drug discontinuation were generally the same as in study 0104, except that under a 
protocol amendment the total duration allowed was extended from 84 days to 180 days and that some 
patients could be treated for > 180 days under country-specific amendments. 
Main inclusion criteria 
Male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years of age, with proven, probable or possible IFD caused by 
Aspergillus species, rare molds, yeasts, or other dimorphic fungi (i.e. fungal pathogens other than Aspergillus 
fumigatus or Candida species) were enrolled into the study. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Patients with a known history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or any serious reaction to the azole class of 
antifungals or to any component of the study drug, at high risk for QT prolongation or with risk factors for 
Torsades de Pointes or use of concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT interval, with evidence 
of hepatic dysfunction or concomitant use of astemizole, cisapride, rifampin/rifampicin, rifabutin, ergot 
alkaloids, long acting barbiturates, ritonavir, efavirenz, carbamazepine, pimozide, quinidine, neostigmine, 
terfenadine, ketoconazole, valproic acid or St. John’s Wort in the 5 days prior to first administration of study 
drug were excluded from the study. 
Treatments 
Isavuconazole was administered during the study as either IV or oral.  
An IV isavuconazole loading regimen was administered during the first 48 hours (200 mg q8h) followed by a 
maintenance dose from day 3 to EOT (200 mg q24h). The first maintenance dose (day 3) was not to have 
been administered earlier than 12h after the last loading dose. Infusions were given over a period of at least 
1 hour.  
Oral isavuconazole was taken without regard to food intake. An oral isavuconazole loading regimen was 
administered during the first 48 hours (2 x 100 mg capsules q8h) followed by a maintenance dose from day 3 
to EOT (2 x 100 mg capsules qd).

Objectives 
The primary objective was to describe the efficacy of isavuconazole in the treatment of eligible patients with 
any of the following: 
a)  
b)  
Proven, probable or possible invasive aspergillosis with CrCL < 50 mL/min; primary treatment  
Proven  or  culture  positive  probable  IFD  due  to  moulds,  yeasts  or  dimorphic  fungi  other  than 
Aspergillus  fumigatus  or  Candida  species;  primary  treatment,  refractory  or  intolerant  of  prior 
therapy (based on renal function, AEs or inadequate plasma concentrations)  
c)  
Proven or probable zygomycosis documented by culture or histology/cytology 
In the final analysis renal, impairment was re-defined as eGFRMDRD < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
The secondary objective of the study was to characterize the safety and tolerability while assessing additional 
efficacy of treatment with isavuconazole. Exploratory endpoints were the concentration-time profiles of study 
drug and metabolite(s) if warranted in patients from the PK substudy and characterization of pharmacokinetic 
trough values of study drug and metabolite(s) if warranted. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary outcomes were: 
-  Overall response evaluated by DRC at EOT, day 42 and day 84, by pathogen causing IFD as determined 
by the DRC; 
The secondary efficacy outcomes included: 
-  Clinical  response,  mycological  response  and  radiological  response  assessed  by  the  DRC  at  EOT,  day  42 
and day 84 and EOT; 
-  Mortality rate of patients at multiple time points. 
The study protocol identified the DRC-assessed overall response as the primary endpoint, given the variety of 
fungal infections where mortality may or may not be appropriate. In mucormycosis, the applicant has chosen 
mortality as the most relevant endpoint to be able to compare the results from Study 9766-CL-0103 to those 
reported in literature (for instance with standard care liposomal amphotericin B). However, as in study 9766-
CL-0104, the “DRC - assessed overall response at EOT”, a combined endpoint of clinical, mycological and 
radiological responses at EOT, is considered the most important endpoint for the CHMP. 
Study visits were scheduled in line with study 0104. Overall response was assessed by the DRC as success 
(complete or partial) or failure (stable or progression) as follows: 
Success-complete: Resolution of all clinical symptoms and physical findings associated with IFD; 
resolution of radiological abnormalities (≥ 90% response in some cases); presumed or documented 
eradication 
Success-partial: Resolution of some clinical symptoms and physical findings associated with IFD; 
improvement of radiological abnormalities (at least 25% response at Week 6 or 50% at week 12); 
presumed or documented eradication 
Failure-stable: Minor or no change in clinical symptoms and physical findings and radiographic 
abnormalities associated with IFD but no evidence of progression  
Failure-progression: Evidence of progression based on clinical, radiologic and mycological criteria. 
Worsening or new clinical symptoms and physical findings and/or radiographic abnormalities associated 
with IFD; alternative systemic antifungal treatment required.

The DRC assessed the attributable mortality with categorisation, as in study 9766-CL-0104. 
PK intensive data were obtained over 24h on day 7 or preferably day 14 in a  subset. Trough samples were 
collected from all patients at days 7, 14, 28, 42, 84, and every 4 weeks thereafter. 
Overall outcomes and clinical, radiological and mycological responses were evaluated by the DRC at day 42, 
day 84 and EOT. Rules applied were similar to those in study 9766-CL-0104. Investigators evaluated clinical, 
radiological and mycological responses at EOT, day 42 and day 84.  
The  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  of  DRC-assessed  overall  response  at  EOT  was  analysed  for  the  mITT 
Mucorales population and the mITT-Aspergillus population. 
Sample size 
Approximately 100 patients, with proven or probable IFD were to be enrolled in the study, later increased to 
150 to enrol at least 30 renally impaired patients with IFD and “adequate” numbers with mucormycosis. 
Randomisation 
This study was not randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
No statistical hypothesis was tested in this non-randomised open-label study.

Patients were enrolled in this multicentre study at 34 centres in the US, EU, South America, Asia and the 
Middle East. Of the 149 patients enrolled, 146 (98%) evaluable patients of which 59/146 (40.4%) were 
renally impaired (RI). The mITT—Mucorales population consisted of 37 patients and the mITT—Aspergillus 
population of 24 patients (20 renally impaired [NI] and 4 non-renally impaired [NRI]) (see table below):

Summary of Demographics and Baseline Characteristics (ITT Population), study 
9766-CL-0103 
The median age of patients in the ITT population was 52 years (range: 18 - 92 years).  
Among the 121 patients (82.9%) with a primary underlying disease or condition, the most common was AML 
(29 patients [19.9%]) followed by CLL (9 [6.2%]); all others occurred in < 10 patients. 
The median age of mITT-Mucorales patients was 50 years (range: 22 - 79 years). Overall, 81.1% of mITT-
Mucorales patients were male and 67.6% of patients were white. Overall, 59.5% of mITT-Mucorales patients 
had a hematologic malignancy, 35.1% of mITT-Mucorales patients had a prior allogeneic BMT and 27.0% was 
neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 0.5 x 109/L or < 500/mm3). The most commonly reported primary 
underlying diseases were AML, ALL and diabetes mellitus. 
Numbers analysed 
o  The ITT and mITT populations were defined as in study 9766-CL-0104.  
o  The mITT-Mucorales population included DRC-classified Mucorales only  
o  The mITT-Aspergillus  population included DRC-classified  Aspergillus  only or no pathogen identified,  but

For the ITT population, the median total duration of treatment was 94 days (range: 1-882 days). Overall, 
100 patients (68.5%) received IV isavuconazole and 126 (86.3%) received oral isavuconazole with median 
durations of 9.5 and 136.8 days, respectively.  
For the mITT-Mucorales population, the overall median duration of treatment was 84 days: 10 days for i.v. 
dosing and 80 days for oral therapy. There were 7 patients (18.9%) who were treated for longer than 180 
days. Overall, 51.4% of patients were treated for ≥ 84 days. The median duration for i.v. dosing was 9.5 
days, and 142.8 days for oral dosing. One patient had received study drug for 258 days and another for 882 
days. Cumulative adherence ≥ 80% during the loading period occurred in 95.9% of patients. For 81 who 
received IV isavuconazole in the maintenance phase the cumulative adherence ≥ 80% was 98.8% and for 
125 who received oral isavuconazole 90.1% were ≥ 80% adherent. Four sites did not use the correct filters 
and 6 patients received isavuconazole without a filter. 
Isavuconazole was administered during the study 9766-CL-0103 as either i.v. or oral. Patients who started on 
oral therapy or patients who had already switched from i.v. to oral therapy may have switched back to i.v. 
therapy at any time if the investigator felt it was necessary, e.g., it was in the patient’s best interest or for 
the appropriate clinical management of the patient. A total of 9 out of 37 (24%) patients were switched back 
from i.v. to oral therapy. Reasons for switching back were however considered comprehensible. No impact on 
clinical outcomes is expected from multiple switches between formulations as the intravenous and oral 
formulations are bioequivalent. 
The all-cause mortality through day 42 in the ITT population was 18.5% (22.0% RI and 16.1% NRI) whereas 
rates through day 84 were 24.7% overall (30.5% RI and 20.7% NRI) patients. There were 33 (22.6%) 
reported patient deaths by day 84 and 3 LTFU patients who were counted as having died. 
Mucorales 
Of 38 assessed by the DRC as having Mucorales only, 37 had a proven (32) or probable (5) infection. Of 
these 37, 21 received isavuconazole as primary therapy while 11 were refractory and 5 were intolerant to 
prior AFT. One of the 38 had a possible infection and was excluded from the mITT analysis while 8 others 
were excluded because they had Mucorales plus another fungal pathogen. The median duration of treatment 
was 84 days but 7 received > 180 days. As of the cut-off date 24/37 (64.9%) had discontinued treatment, 
see following table:

Population), study 9766-CL-0103 
Through day 42, death occurred in 14 patients (37.8%) while 16 (43.2%) had died by day 84 (see following 
table). The Kaplan-Meier estimates were 64.9% to day 42, 59.2% to day 84, 56.4% to day 120 and 52.9% 
to day 180.

A vast majority of deaths were considered by the DRC to be due to or associated with IFD, see following

DRC-assessed Attribution of IFD to Death by Therapy Status (mITT-Mucorales 
Population), study 9766-CL-0103 
Two patients were continuing in the study and thus the DRC did not assess their efficacy outcome at EOT. As 
requested, the applicant has provided an update on the status of these two patients as was requested. One 
patient was considered completely cured. The other patient was responding clinically and continuing 
isavuconazole treatment. 
For the other 35 the DRC-assessed overall success rate at EOT was 11/35* (31.4%), with 5 patients with 
complete success and 6 with partial success. When the 10 stable patients were included as successes the rate 
was 60.0% (21/35).

At day 42 and day 84, the clinical responses were considerably higher than the mycological responses. 
Because the mycological responses were predominantly ‘presumed’ based, and therefore depending on the 
clinical and radiological outcomes, the lower number of mycological responses compared to clinical responses 
is explained by the very low radiological response rate. 
Investigator success rates at EOT were consistently higher for clinical, mycological and radiological outcomes 
(54.5%, 41.7% and 26.5%, respectively) vs. DRC-assessed rates. For primary patients, the investigator 
success rates at EOT were also higher (65.0%, 42.9% and 30.0%, respectively). 
Prior Medications and Nonmedication Procedures (ITT Population, 9766-CL-0103) 
In the ITT population, 69.9% of the patients received prior antifungal therapy (AFT). Amongst the most 
common used classes of prior AFTs were antimycotics for systemic use (68.5%) and triazole derivatives 
(53.4%). For patients who required primary therapy for invasive aspergillosis, prior use of potentially mould 
active systemic AFT was allowed per protocol, as long as it was not administered more than 4 cumulative 
days within 7 days prior to first administration of study drug. These patients also could have prophylactically 
received 14 consecutive days of amphotericin B product or an echinocandin and developed new evidence of 
IFD and still have been eligible for enrolment.  
If all primary cases received prior amphotericin it could have impact the study results  because response 
rates in primary treatment and salvage therapy are not necessarily the same ( Skiada et al, Haematol. 
20134. A tabular overview summarising all patients with prior use of amphotericin is listed in the following 
table:

Table 40 
Summary of patients with prior amphotericin B use 
This tabular overview explains on which base investigators decided patients entering the study (ie, if they 
were to be regarded as primary patients, if they had failed to or were intolerant to treatment with other 
antifungal drugs) and whether the patients had received pre-study amphotericin and/or other antifungal 
drugs active against mucormycosis (i.e. posaconazole). The reasons for inclusion of the patients are 
considered justified and in compliance with the study protocol.  
A total of eight patients (5.5%) underwent surgery and 10 patients (6.8%) underwent debridement as part of 
their treatment of IFD. 
Concomitant Medications and Nonmedication Procedures (ITT Population, 9766-CL-0103) 
In the ITT population, 97.3% received at least one concomitant drug. The 3 most commonly used classes of 
concomitant medications in the ITT population were analgesics (87.0%), ophthalmologicals (84.9%), and 
antibacterials for systemic use (77.4%). The 3 most commonly used classes of concomitant AFT were 
antimycotics for systemic use (40.4%), antifungals for dermatological use (30.8%) and gynecological 
antiinfectives and antiseptics (30.8%). Whether these antifungals were potentially active against Mucorales 
was however unknown. In the ITT population, 76.0% of patients underwent concomitant non-medication

procedures most commonly packed red blood cell transfusion (43.2%), platelet transfusion (37.7%), and 
central venous catheterization (16.4%). The contribution of isavuconazole to antifungal treatment was 
considered difficult to determine when 40.4% of the patients took concomitant systemic antifungals. 
Only 1 out of 21 patients had a concomitant systemic Mucorales active antifungal treatment (patient who had 
1 day of L-amB on Day 4).  
Design of the pivotal study in Mucormycosis (9766-CL-0103); External control data to put the 
mortality and clinical response rates into context  
Compassionate use 
The following shortcomings of study 9766-CL-0103 were highlighted during the procedure: 
  Design was uncontrolled; 
The applicant pointed out during the procedure that no randomized controlled studies had been published 
that compared different Mucorales-active antifungal treatments head-to-head in mucormycosis (including 
“standard care drug” L-amB). All studies in L-Amb were uncontrolled and performed in a limited number of 
patients who had a wide range of baseline characteristics and underwent a range of other interventions (e.g. 
surgery, correction of predisposing conditions). CHMP agreed that the fact that only uncontrolled data were 
available was not critical. Nevertheless, it was considered that the external control data were inadequate to 
put the clinical response rates into context and therefore the indication “treatment of mucormycosis” could 
not be approvable. 
 
There were inadequate external control data to put the mortality rates and clinical response rates into 
context; 
At CHMP request, the applicant provided additional analyses to put all-cause mortality rates and overall 
response rates observed in study 9766-CL-0103 in the context of external control data. These external 
control data are mainly based on (liposomal-) amphotericin-B, which is considered acceptable.  
It was already concluded that the ACM data from study 9766-CL-0103 were correctly put into the context of 
external control data on mortality, and that the survival benefits provided by isavuconazole in the treatment 
of mucormycosis seems similar to the survival benefits provided by liposomal amphotericine-B. 
In order to put the overall response rates observed in study 9766-CL-0103 in the context of external control 
data, the Applicant submitted data on five clinical amphotericin-B-based studies. The conclusion of the 
applicant that, based on study methodology, only the studies by Shoham (Shoham 2010), Xhaard (Xhaard 
2012) and Lanternier (Lanternier 2012) were considered appropriate for an external comparison of overall 
response rates with study 9766-CL-0103, was agreed by CHMP, since these studies were largely consistent 
with EORTC/MSG definitions. These three studies were considered as a narrow but acceptable basis for the 
discussion on the overall response rates observed in study 9766-CL-0103 and to put these in external 
context of AmB in the treatment of this very rare disease.  
The overall success rates (32% to 42%) reported in the three studies were similar to the reported overall 
success rate of 32% for patients with primary therapy in study 9766-CL-0103. The Ambizygo study by 
Lanternier (2012), which was the only interventional study that used a similar DRC assessment as study 
9766-CL-0103 with high dose L amB (10 mg/kg per day), showed very similar response rates and mortality.  
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 108/162 
 
  
  
 
From the sparse data available, it appears that the overall response rates in study 9766-CL-0103 are 
consistent with that observed in external control studies performed with amphotericin-B, the only approved 
antifugal drug in the treatment of mucormycosis. 
During the procedure, and taking into account the CHMP concerns, the applicant decided to change the 
indication applied for to treatment of adult patients “with mucormycosis for whom amB is inappropriate”. 
Although the absolute number of patients with a refractory status was low in study 9766-CL-0103, most (10 
out of 11) had received prior amB based treatments, and 3 of the 5 patients with an intolerant therapy status 
had received prior amB (these patients were discontinued from amB due to severe renal side effects). These 
13 patients were considered relevant for the above proposed indication. Of the amB-refractory patients 60% 
had a complete, partial, or stable response and 2 of the 3 patients intolerant to amB-based therapies who 
survived more than 3 months also had a stable response. 
The reported adverse event related overall discontinuation rate in the Ambizygo study (Lanternier 2012) was 
about 20% (L amB 3mg/kg/day) and 32% in the AmbiLoad study in aspergillosis with a higher regimen of 10 
mg L-amB /kg/day (Cornely 2007). AmB-based therapies are known for the risk of development of (severe) 
renal side-effects. Isavuconazole was well tolerated in patients (10 out of 37) enrolled in study 9766-CL-0103 
who had a baseline creatinine-clearance of < 60 mL/min. Isavuconazole (available as IV and oral dosage 
forms) offers an added treatment option for renally impaired patients with invasive aspergillosis and 
mucormycosis. 
Ancillary analyses 
  Compassionate use of isavuconazole 
The four reported cases on isavuconazole as compassionate use give some further support for the proposed 
indication “Patients with mucormycosis for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate”. These patients were are 
all pre-treated with amB-based regimens, in most cases posaconazole was added to the regime. In two of the 
patients CNS was also involved, which has a poor prognosis. Two patients were intolerant to L-amb and 
developed renal impairment. The patients appeared to benefit from treatment with isavuconazole. Moreover, 
isavuconazole was well tolerated, enabling long term treatment. 
Literature review on Mucorales 
The applicant reviewed the literature on mortality and/or clinical efficacy data with amphotericin B and 
posaconazole in mucormycosis.  
Ten of 39 publications of some relevance presented all-cause mortality – 5 in mixed underlying conditions, 2 
in such patients treated with posaconazole and 3 in which patients were treated with amphotericin B 
formulations. The publications were reviewed for factors that are known to influence prognosis and outcomes 
in patients with mucormycosis and then compared with patients in study 9766-CL-0103.

Despite the limitations, the 7 publications reported mortality rates in the range of 32% to 61%, with most of 
the reports showing mortality between 35% and 45% compared to 38% and 43% mortality rates observed 
through day 42 and day 84, respectively, in study 9766-CL-0103. The only publication that used the 12 week 
endpoint reported a mortality rate of 42%, which compares closely with day 84 in study 9766-CL-0103. 
In addition, patients in study 9766-CL-0103 assessed by the DRC as having received isavuconazole as 
primary therapy for proven or probable mucormycosis were matched with patients from the Fungiscope 
Registry Database who received primary therapy with amphotericin B for proven or probable mucormycosis. 
The registry contains > 150 cases of mucormycosis diagnosed and treated between 2003 and 2013. At least 
1 matching case was found for all of the 21 cases in study 9766-CL-0103 included in the mortality 
assessment. Nevertheless, there were differences in several factors between the cases and controls:

The day 84 survival estimates for study 9766-CL-0103 cases were similar to those for the matched controls 
(57.1% vs. 49.7% for controls). 
The overall response rate at EOT in Mucorales is low and the all-cause mortality through day 42 and day 84 
was high. These results are not unexpected, since most of these patients were very ill and were infected with 
pathogens that generally are resistant to most antifungal drugs.  
In order to put the mortality rates of isavuconazole (at day 42 and day 84) into the context of the external 
control data, an analysis on overall mortality has been submitted, based on an extensive overview of 
literature in support of amphotericin-B, which is considered as first-line treatment in mucormycosis. L-amB is 
being preferred to amphotericin deoxycholate (amB-DC) due to its lower toxicity, and to lipid complex 
amphotericin (ABLC) based on available clinical data.  
The following figure presents the survival probability through day 84 from the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
using the last known survival status. The day 84 survival estimates for the patients from study 9766-CL-0103 
were comparable to those for the matched-control cases of amphotericin B (57.1% for 9766-CL-0103 
patients, 49.7% for the matched controls).

Survival probability through Day 84 by Kaplan-Meier method 
As presented above, the day 84 survival estimates for the patients from study 9766-CL-0103 seem 
comparable to those of the matched control cases of amphotericin B. 
Furthermore, to compare the results from study 9766-CL-0103 with the data obtained from the Fungiscope 
registry and from published observational studies that reported ACM in untreated patients and in amB-
treated patients, the applicant has combined various data sources in a meta-analytic approach, which is 
shown below:

The Fungiscope matched-control analysis as provided by applicant underlines a significant treatment benefit 
of amB compared to untreated patients, and the analysis shows that the treatment effect with isavuconazole 
in respect to improving survival of patients seems comparable to that of amphotericin-B.  
The use of (liposomal) amphotericine-B in mucormycosis is without doubt the best documented. A clinically 
significant benefit of amphotericin-B treatment compared to untreated patients is shown. Liposomal 
amphotericine B is the only antifungal medicine that is registered for first line treament of mucormycosis (EU 
and USA) and is considered as the “standard of care”. All-cause mortality in study 9766-CL-0103 
(isavuconazole) appears to be compable to all-cause mortality as reported in literature for the use of 
liposomal amphotericine-B as first line treatment in mucormycosis.  
Efficacy results in mITT-Aspergillus Population in RI and NRI patients, study 9766-CL-0103 
 
The DRC assessed 24 patients as having only an Aspergillus infection (9 proven and 15 probable). Of the 
24, 20 were classed as RI patients. The most common were Aspergillus fumigatus (41.7%) and 
Aspergillus flavus (20.8%). Aspergillus infection was confined to the LRTD in 62.5%.  
All-cause mortality to day 42 was 3/24 (12.5%) and to day 84 it was 6 (25.0%) deaths.  
The DRC-assessed overall success rate at EOT was 34.8%, at which time 56.5% had a successful clinical 
response, 39.1% had a successful mycological response and 21.7% had a successful radiological

response.  
 
Overall success rates were 29.2% at day 42 and also at day 84. At day 84, 41.7% had a clinical success, 
a third had a mycological response and 20% had a radiological response. 
Patients with invasive aspergillosis and renal impairment 
Patients in study 9766-CL-0103 and a small number in 9766-CL-0104 had invasive aspergillosis and renal 
impairment (eGFR-MDRD < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Data were pooled across the 143 in the myITT population 
in 0104 and mITT-Aspergillus population in 0103 with known renal status.

patients who the DRC classified as Aspergillus only). 
‡ Patients with an unknown renal status were not included in the pooled analysis. 
The mean age was higher in the RI group (58.4 vs. 49.1 years) while haematologic malignancy and 
neutropenia were less prevalent in the RI group (64.5% vs. 80.4% and 32.3% vs. 67.0%, respectively). The

majority of the non-RI had Aspergillus diagnosed by GM only (51.8%) vs. 22.6% of the RI patients but 
Aspergillus fumigatus was commonest in both groups (25.9% and 32.3%, respectively). 
The numerically lower mortality in the RI patients at day 42 only may relate to the small number of patients 
in this group or differences in the baseline disease characteristics, see following table:

At EOT, the DRC-assessed overall response success rates were similar for RI and non-RI groups (36.0% and 
32.3%, respectively). The clinical response success rates were also similar (60.4% and 58.1%, respectively) 
with mycological response success rates of 39.6% and 35.5% and radiological response success rates of 
32.4% and 16.1%, respectively.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Paediatric population 
No children were included in the phase 1, phase 2 or phase 3 studies and no children were treated with 
isavuconazole. Only male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years, at time of signing the informed consent form 
were included in the clinical trials. 
Of note, in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 as amended (‘paediatric’ regulation) 
isavuconazonium (sulfate) has an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (procedure number EMEA-001301-PIP-
12) for the conditions “Treatment of invasive aspergillosis” and “Treatment of mucormycosis” in children from 
birth to less than 18 years of age with a deferral in place. [EMA Decision No., P/0135/2013, dated 14 June 
2013].

Older subjects 
No specific efficacy study was performed in older people. 
An overview of the age distribution of patients across the various age categories is listed in the following 
table: 
Table 50  
 Study 9766-CL-0104: Age distribution in the Safety, mITT and myITT populations 
The distribution was comparable for the safety, the mITT and myITT populations (for both treatment groups). 
No dose adjustments are recommended in older subjects. 
Renally impaired patients 
Supportive evidence on the efficacy of isavuconazole in renally-impaired patients with invasive aspergillosis is 
provided by study 9766-CL-0103, which enrolled a subpopulation of patients with invasive aspergillosis and 
renal impairment. On the basis of the results of study 9766-CL-0103, no dose adjustments are recommended 
in renally impaired patients. 
Hepatically impaired patients 
For isavuconazole, statistical results indicate that after i.v. administration, total plasma Cl decreased by 30 
and 51% in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. Comparable results were 
observed for free plasma Cl (-34 and -63% respectively). After oral administration total plasma Cl/F 
decreased by 27 and 42% in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. For free 
plasma Cl/F this was -28 and -61%, respectively. A limited number of subjects were included and a large 
variability is observed, which may result in patients to be under dosed, but also that patients may have larger 
exposures than the mean 2-fold increase. Considering the limited available data, and the fact that no severe 
AEs were identified, CHMP agreed that a dose adjustment was not necessary, but considered necessary to 
include an adequate warning in the SmPC. 
Supportive studies 
The phase 2 study 9766-CL-0101 was conducted in “uncomplicated esophageal candidiasis” and study 9766-
CL-0102 was conducted in “prophylaxis of patients undergoing chemotherapy for AML”. CHMP agreed that 
Assessment report

Page 119/162 
 
  
  
 
while these studies could not be considered of relevance for the claimed indications, they could be considered 
as supportive for safety only. The key design features of both phase 2 studies are summarized in the tabular 
overview of the performed clinical studies. 
Pivotal studies no 9766-CL-0103 and 0104: the use of in-line filters 
In the phase 3 studies in-line filters were to be used but some sites used the wrong pore size and some 
patients received unfiltered drug. The final advice regarding use of in-line filters requires further discussion in 
terms of the potential clinical effects of their use vs. their omission. The applicant was asked to clarify. From 
the applicant’s response the following is concluded: 
Efficacy 
On the basis of the available data no conclusions with regard to any consequences for the clinical efficacy of 
Cresemba can be drawn. 
Safety 
From the two analyses performed, for both studies separately, no occurrence of an embolic or thrombotic-
type AE was observed. However, no definitive conclusions with regard to safety of Cresemba iv can be drawn 
on the basis of the available information. 
According to the applicant, the review of the safety data from patients (n=27) administered intravenous 
isavuconazole without an in-line filter and from an additional 21 patients administered the drug with an 
incorrect filter, did not suggest a causal relationship between the absence of an in-line filter and pulmonary 
events or systemic infusion reactions.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Isavuconazonium sulfate is an antifungal agent and the prodrug of the active moiety isavuconazole. 
Isavuconazole, a triazole, demonstrates a fungicidal effect by blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, a key 
component of the fungal cell membrane. 
CRESEMBA is indicated in adults for the treatment of 
 
invasive aspergillosis 
  mucormycosis in patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) 
Invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis are both very rare life threatening fungal infections that are seen 
predominantly in immunocompromised patients. There are only a few treatment options available. There is 
an urgent medical need for new effective antifungal drugs. 
No formal dose-finding studies were conducted. Despite different in vitro and in vivo models to simulate the 
relation between MIC and AUC, no conclusions could be drawn with regard to the adequate dose–effect 
relation. All the evidence was therefore to be derived from the two pivotal phase 3 trials, study 9766-CL-
0104 in invasive aspergillosis and study 9766-CL-0103 in mucormycosis.

Page 120/162 
 
  
  
Treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis 
This indication rests on a single pivotal study (9766-CL-0104) against an appropriate comparator 
(voriconazole) used at the approved dose regimen and with an allowance for up to 12 weeks treatment. The 
study was not confined to infections due to Aspergillus and it allowed recruitment of patients with possible 
IFD but only those with proven or probably IFD were included in the mITT population and only mITT patients 
with aspergillosis were included in the mITT population. Therefore these, and particularly the latter, are the 
critical analysis populations. Those with chronic infections or aspergillomas were excluded, which effectively 
resulted in the majority of patients having some degree of immunosuppression at baseline. These basic 
design features of the study were generally appropriate. 
The EORTC/MSG criteria were used for patient categorisation and a DMC was used to determine the IFD 
diagnosis at baseline as well as the patient and mycological responses to treatment. The use of 
galactomannan as a marker of infection was in accordance with EORTC/MSG recommendations of 2008 and 
the testing was repeated at central laboratories using a single commercial assay. 
About half of all patients had IFD (mITT) and just under half had aspergillosis (myITT); clearly not all of 
these patients completed treatment. In addition, the majority of patients had only GM evidence of a pathogen 
and only about one third of the MITT population had other evidence of aspergillosis although in most of these 
it was found alone. 
In the mITT population the outcomes at EOT by CLSI MICs were presented for 41 isavuconazole and 24 
voriconazole cases involving Aspergillus spp. Numbers for outcomes presented by EUCAST MICs are 47 and 
25 in respective groups. Such small numbers cannot support what is anyway a crude analysis of outcomes by 
MIC. The paucity of isolates with MIC documented, along with the inadequate PK sampling in this study, also 
means that good quality analyses of exposure-response that take into account individual patient AUC/MIC 
ratios (i.e. POPPK-predicted AUC from individual sparse PK data and the MIC documented for that patient’s 
pathogen) are impossible. Due to the combined lack of appropriate PK/PD analyses and the paucity of clinical 
and mycological data for those who actually had a pathogen isolated it is difficult to conclude on the highest 
MIC of isavuconazole that may be treatable with the recommended dose regimen. EUCAST recommended 
clinical breakpoints for Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus terreus. There are 
currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for other Aspergillus species. CHMP endorsed the 
EUCAST recommendations. 
The baseline demographic and underlying disease distributions for the mITT and myITT populations showed 
some features that occurred more and some less often in the isavuconazole group.  
Day 42 mortality rates were consistently similar between treatments. In the myITT population, which is the 
primary population of interest to support the indication claimed (123 isavuconazole and 108 voriconazole 
cases) the observed mortality rates were numerically lower for isavuconazole. These numerical differences 
between treatments persisted for mortality rates at day 84. 
The DRC-assigned overall success rates at EOT were generally comparable or slightly numerically lower for 
isavuconazole. The DRC-assigned success rates at days 42 in the mITT and myITT populations were broadly 
comparable between treatments. Nevertheless, in the myITT patients with aspergillosis that was not 
diagnosed based solely on GM the responses were 19/52 (36.5%) vs. 14/40 (35%). For analyses in these 
and other relatively small subsets, which are very small if focussing only on the myITT population, it is 
difficult to interpret the imbalances observed in both directions according to various other factors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 121/162 
 
  
  
Asian patients had a numerically lower success rate in the isavuconazole group (25.9%, 7/27) than in the 
voriconazole treatment group (48.6%, 17/35). The observed differences in response rates between Asian and 
non-Asian patients cannot be explained by drug exposure. From six Asian patients with MIC values available 
all were below 2 µg/mL, so it is considered not likely that resistance to isavuconazole does explain the results 
in overall response at EOT. The differences in favour of voriconazole were not consistent across the Asian 
countries; they were apparent in Thailand and South Korea, but not in China and India. Therefore no 
definitive conclusions could be drawn. CHMP agreed that a potential ethnicity effect could not be excluded at 
present and has agreed to the inclusion of this as missing information in the RMP.  
During the procedure, some other concerns were raised by CHMP, one of which related to the relatively high 
number of protocol violations that were reported in the ITT-population, in particular the number of patients 
who discontinued treatment primarily due to Insufficient Therapeutic Response that was considerably higher 
in the isavuconazole treatment group than in the voriconazole treatment group. It was initially not clear 
whether this imbalance in discontinuation rates would be of the same magnitude in mITT and myITT 
populations, which are considered more conclusive in this respect. It was clarified that despite the rather high 
treatment discontinuation rates in mITT and myITT, no imbalance between the two treatment groups 
(isavuconazole and voriconazole) was noticed. CHMP agreed that there was enough support of the validity of 
the comparison between treatments in the mITT and myITT populations. These concerns were therefore 
considered resolved. 
Treatment of Mucormycoses 
The invasive fungal disease caused by fungi classified as the order of Mucorales (e.g. Rhizopus, Mucor, 
Rhizomucor) is characterized by high mortality and requires antifungal treatment, debridement and 
correction of underlying predisposing conditions (e.g. cessation of corticosteroids, correction of neutropenia 
and metabolic disorders). Proof for the recommended antifungals (amphotericin (primary treatment) and 
posaconazole (salvage therapy) or combinations) is derived from in vitro data and mostly from small 
retrospective cases series with 20-40 cases. Extrapolation of results from one study to others is hampered by 
different predisposing conditions, different sites of infection and combined efforts to diminish fungal load and 
improve the immune system of the host. 
The uncontrolled study (study 9766-CL-0103) had several aims and recruited a very mixed population, 
including some that could be dosed orally from the outset and were managed as outpatients as well as 
patients with a range of different infection sites. The sub-population of interest is the DRC-classified mITT-
Mucorales, which included 32 proven and 5 probable infections of which 21/37 were treated for the first time 
in this study.  
The applicant has put the results of uncontrolled study 9766-CL-0103 into context. The applicant’s response 
was based on external control data of “standard-care drug” liposomal amphotericine-B, which was considered 
acceptable since the use of (Liposomal) amphotericine-B in mucormycosis is without doubt is the best 
documented. It is the only antifungal drug that is registered for first line treament of mucormycosis (EU and 
USA). Based on the presented Fungiscope matched-control analysis, the mortality rate with the use of 
isavuconazole appears to be comparable to that reported in literature for standard care Liposomal 
amphotericin B in the treatment of mucormycosis. 
In order to put the overall response rates observed in study 9766-CL-0103 in the context of external control 
data, the applicant also submitted data on five clinical amphotericin-B-based studies, out of which three 
studies were considered by CHMP as a narrow but acceptable basis for the discussion on the overall response 
rates observed in study 9766-CL-0103 and to put these in external context of AmB in the treatment of this 
Assessment report

Page 122/162 
 
  
  
very rare disease. The overall success rates (32% to 42%) reported in the three studies were similar as 
those reported overall success rate of 32% for patients with primary therapy in study 9766-CL-0103. 
Although sparse, from data available, it appears that the overall response rates in study 9766-CL-0103 were 
consistent with that observed in external control studies performed with amphotericin-B, the only approved 
antifugal drug in the treatment of mucormycosis. 
To further address the above mentioned issues, the applicant decided during the procedure to change the 
indication applied for to the treatment of adult “patients with mucormycosis for whom amB is inappropriate”. 
Although the absolute number of patients with a refractory status was low in study 9766-CL-0103, most (10 
out of 11) had received prior amB based treatments, and 3 of the 5 patients with an intolerant therapy status 
had received prior amB (these patients were discontinued from amB due to severe renal side effects). These 
13 patients were considered relevant for the above proposed indication. Of the amB-refractory patients 60% 
had a complete, partial, or stable response, and 2 of the 3 patients intolerant to amB-based therapies who 
survived more than 3 months also had a stable response. 
The reported adverse event related overall discontinuation rate in the Ambizygo study (Lanternier 2012) was 
about 20% (L amB 3mg/kg/day) and 32% in the AmbiLoad study in aspergillosis with a higher regimen of 10 
mg L-amB /kg/day (Cornely 2007). AmB-based therapies are known for the risk of development of (severe) 
renal side-effects. Isavuconazole was well tolerated in patients (10 out of 37) enrolled in study 9766-CL-0103 
who had a baseline creatinine-clearance of < 60 mL/min. Isavuconazole (available as IV and oral dosage 
forms) offers an added treatment option for renally impaired patients with invasive aspergillosis and 
mucormycosis. 
The four reported cases on isavuconazole as compassionate use further supported the above proposed 
indication “Patients with mucormycosis for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate”. These patients were all 
pre-treated with amB-based regimens, in most cases posaconazole was added to the regime. In two of the 
patients CNS was also involved, which has a poor prognosis. Two patients were intolerant to L-amb and 
developed renal impairment. The patients appeared to benefit from treatment with isavuconazole. Moreover, 
isavuconazole was well tolerated, enabling long term treatment. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
From a clinical perspective the indication “treatment of invasive aspergillosis” is approvable. 
The efficacy data submitted in support of mucormycosis give support to the indication “mucormycosis in 
patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate”, with the limitations of clinical data described in section 
4.4 and 5.1. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Adverse Effects Characteristic of the Pharmacological Class 
Isavuconazole is a member of the azole class of antifungal agents. Elevated liver transaminases, infusion-
related reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) are considered important risks for the azole 
class effects. Additional class effects include anaphylaxis, QT prolongation/torsades de pointes, visual 
disturbances, psychiatric events and acute pancreatitis events that have been reported with other marketed 
azole antifungal agents (i.e., voriconazole, posaconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole). 
Safety Population 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 123/162 
 
  
  
Clinical programme 
The integrated safety analyses were conducted in 3 populations: the phase 3 controlled population (Study 
9766-CL-0104), the phase 2 and 3 population (isavuconazole treatment only) and the phase 1 population 
(integrated data from healthy subjects treated in 40 phase 1 studies). 
The applicant’s evaluation of safety was primarily based on the data from the active-controlled study versus 
voriconazole (Study 9766-CL-0104).  
This approach is agreed, since the two phase 2 studies (9766-CL-0101 and 9766-CL-0102) were evaluating 
isavuconazole in different patient populations (9766-CL-0101 in patients with uncomplicated esophageal 
candidiasis [= less severe, non-invasive fungal disease] and 9766-CL-102 in neutropenic patients undergoing 
chemotherapy with isavuconazole used as profylactic treatment), and therefore considered not to be 
representative for the phase 3 population.  
Furthermore, study 9766-CL-0103 was an open study in a very heterogeneous population consisting of 
different subpopulations. Moreover the Mucorales subpopulation was administered other concomitant 
antibiotic and antifungal medication (and surgery/debridement), potentially affecting the incidence of AE’s in 
patients treated with isavuconazole. Phase 1 population is still of interest since it allows the evaluation of 
safety in a setting not confounded by underlying complex co-morbidities of these severe ill patients. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1692 subjects received at least one dose of isavuconazole in clinical studies including 1145 subjects 
in the 40 phase 1 studies, 144 subjects in the phase 2 studies and 403 subjects in the phase 3 studies.

A total of 1049 healthy subjects received at least one dose of isavuconazole in a total of 40 completed phase 
1 clinical studies, including single doses of up to 400 mg and multiple doses of up to 600 mg.  
A  total  of  403  patients  with  invasive  aspergillosis  and  other  filamentous  fungi,  or  rare  molds,  yeast  and 
dimorphic fungi were enrolled in the 2 phase 3 studies and received at least one dose of isavuconazole 200 
mg. Within these phase 3 studies, a total of 288 of 403 patients (71.5%) received isavuconazole for at least 
21  days,  269  of  403  patients  (66.7%)  received  isavuconazole  for  at  least  28  days,  144  of  403  patients 
(35.7%) received isavuconazole for at least 84 days, and 52 of 403 patients (12.9%) received isavuconazole 
for at least 180 days. 
Demographics and other characteristics of the study population 
The demographics and underlying diseases of the patients evaluated in the phase 3 controlled population of 
study 9766-CL-0104 is considered to be representative of the target indication (invasive aspergillosis).

Adverse events 
In the overall phase 2 and 3 population, 87.2% of patients treated with isavuconazole experienced a 
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). Serious adverse events occurred in 42.0% of patients, TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation occurred in 11.9% of patients, and 19.9% of patients experienced a TEAE that led 
to death. The majority of events were not considered to be related to study drug. 
The lower incidence of TEAEs and study drug-related TEAEs in the phase 2 studies compared with the phase 
3 studies is most likely related to less severe disease (esophageal candidiasis) in the majority of patients in 
the phase 2 studies than in the phase 3 studies, see following table: 
Table 52

In the overall phase 1 population, TEAEs occurred in 54.8% of subjects. Serious adverse events occurred in 4 
subjects; 3 of these 4 subjects received multiple doses of isavuconazole. Of the 18 subjects who discontinued 
study drug due to an adverse event, 17 received multiple doses of isavuconazole. A total of 45.3% of 
subjects had TEAEs that were considered related to study drug; these TEAEs occurred more frequently in 
subjects who received multiple doses of isavuconazole, see following table:

Adverse events compared to voriconazole (phase 3 controlled population: Study 9766 CL 0104) 
Compared to voriconazole, a statistically significant lower incidence of study drug-related TEAEs (42.4% vs 
59.8%, p<0.05) and TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug (14.4% vs 22.8%, p<0.05) 
was observed in the isavuconazole group.  
Study drug-related TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug also occurred at a lower 
incidence in the isavuconazole group (8.2%) compared with the voriconazole group (13.5%); the difference 
was not statistically significant. The proportion of patients with TEAEs in the remaining categories was similar 
between treatment groups, see following table:

Significant differences in TEAE’s between the treatment groups observed for the following system organ 
classes (SOCs): skin disorders [isavuconazole: 86/257 (33.5% ) vs voriconazole: 110/259 (42.5)%, 
P<0.05)], eye disorders [isavuconazole: 39/257 (15.2%) vs voriconazole: 69/259 (26.6%), P<0.05] and 
hepatobiliary disorders [isavuconazole: 23/257 8.9% vs voriconazole: 42/259 (16.2%), P<0.05) and 
numerically lower rates (by at least 5%) were reported for psychiatric and cardiac disorders. 
These notable differences between treatments by SOC were primarily due to imbalances between treatments 
for the following individual PTs (isavuconazole vs. voriconazole rates): 
  Hepatobiliary disorders SOC:  hyperbilirubinaemia (5, 1.9% vs. 10, 3.9%), hepatic function abnormal (4, 
1.6% vs. 9, 3.5%), jaundice (1, 0.4% vs. 6, 2.3%) and cholestasis (1, 0.4% vs. 6, 2.3%) 
  Eye disorders SOC:  visual impairment (4, 1.6% vs. 19, 7.3%), photophobia (2, 0.8% vs. 6, 2.3%), 
visual acuity reduced (1, 0.4% vs. 6, 2.3%) and retinal haemorrhage (0 vs. 5, 1.9%) 
  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC:  rash (17, 6.6% vs. 28, 10.8%), erythema (9, 3.5% vs. 
15, 5.8%), skin lesion (4, 1.6% vs. 8, 3.1%) and drug eruption (3, 1.2% vs. 11, 4.2%) 
 
Psychiatric disorders:  hallucination (6, 2.3% vs. 11, 4.2%), visual hallucination (3, 1.2% vs. 11, 4.2%) 
and agitation (2, 0.8% vs. 7, 2.7%) 
  Cardiac disorders SOC:  tachycardia (12, 4.7% vs. 21, 8.1%) and cardiac arrest (1, 0.4% vs. 6, 2.3%)

The 5 most common TEAEs (occurring with an incidence ≥ 5%) in the isavuconazole or voriconazole 
treatment groups, respectively, were nausea (27.6% vs 30.1%), vomiting (24.9% vs 28.2%), diarrhoea 
(23.7% vs 23.2%), pyrexia (22.2% vs 30.1%), and hypokalemia (17.5% vs 21.6%). 
The majority of patients had TEAEs that occurred within the first 7 days of treatment in both the 
isavuconazole (75.1%) and voriconazole (84.2%) treatment groups. 
More than half of the patients had TEAEs of severe intensity and approximately one third had TEAEs of 
moderate intensity. Important differences were apparent between isavuconazole and voriconazole for 
moderate or severe TEAEs in 3 SOCs: hepatobiliary disorders (6.6% vs. 10.8%), skin disorders (11.3% vs. 
15.8%) and cardiac disorders (8.6% vs. 14.3%).

In contrast, a higher proportion of isavuconazole-treated patients had drug-related TEAEs within the 
respiratory SOC (6.2% vs. 1.9%), reflecting the rates of dyspnoea. The applicant was requested to clarify 
this. There were also imbalances in respiratory SAEs. Since these findings stand out the applicant was asked

during the procedure to provide details of these cases, including any (S)AEs, related or otherwise, that 
occurred in these cases and whether they occurred concomitantly. 
Based on the submitted data, CHMP concluded the following: 
 
The applicant has been requested to clarify the higher proportion of isavuconazole-treated patients that 
had drug-related TEAEs within the respiratory SOC. The applicant did not provide a rationale, but based 
on the case descriptions no direct relationship between the intake of isavuconazole and the incidence of 
serious TEAEs in respiratory SOC was observed. 
  On the basis of the analysis of five serious TEAEs of dyspnoea in the isavuconazole group it could not be 
concluded that the administration of isavuconazole in itself might lead to dyspnoea. 
  Based on the case descriptions of nine patients with serious TEAEs in respiratory SOC there appears no 
direct relationship between intake of isavuconazole and the incidence of the TEAEs. In eight out of the 9 
described cases, underlying disease appears to have played an (important) role. The only exemption 
might be patient 5502-03. The serious TEAE of acute respiratory failure was considered  “possibly 
related” (according the predefined definition) since there was a temporal relationship between 
administration of isavuconazole and onset of the event, and no clear alternative aetiologies could be 
identified. 
  Dyspnoea occurred during IV infusion of isavuconazole, and may be an element of an infusion reaction 
syndrome. This is adequately warned for in the SmPC. 
Drug-related TEAE’s 
Fewer isavuconazole-treated patients experienced study drug related TEAEs as determined by the 
investigators than voriconazole-treated patients (42.4% vs 59.8%, P<0.05) (see below table) and this overall 
lower rate with isavuconazole vs. voriconazole reflected the following SOCs: hepatobiliary disorders (1.9% vs. 
10.0%), investigations (9.7% vs. 18.1%), eye disorders (3.1% vs. 10.8%) and psychiatric disorders (2.3% 
vs. 11.2%). These differences were primarily influenced by imbalances in rates for the following PTs: 
  Hepatobiliary  disorders  SOC:  hepatic  function  abnormal  (2  (0.8%)  vs.  9  (3.5%)),  hyperbilirubinaemia  (1 
(0.4%) vs. 6 (2.3%)), cholestasis (0 vs. 3 (1.2%)), hepatic failure (0 vs. 3 (1.2%)) and jaundice (0 vs. 2 
(0.8%))

nausea (23.3%) with diarrhoea in 18.5%. Overall, 49.3% experienced TEAEs of severe intensity and 28.8% 
had TEAEs with a maximum intensity of moderate. The most common drug-related TEAEs were nausea

AEs of special interest 
Acute Pancreatitis 
One patient in study 9766-CL-0103 had pancreatitis/pancreatitis relapsing but had a history of pancreatitis. 
On day 1 lipase was >ULN and the patient experienced several episodes of pancreatitis during the course of 
the study, which were considered to be unrelated by the investigator but possibly related by the sponsor. 
Psychiatric Events 
In study 9766-CL-0104 psychiatric events of interest were reported in a similar proportion of isavuconazole 
and voriconazole patients (28.4% vs. 30.5%). The most frequent were insomnia (8.9% vs. 9.3%), anxiety 
(7.8% vs. 6.6%) and confusional state (6.2% vs. 7.7%). Hallucinations were reported by 2.3% vs. 4.2% and 
visual hallucinations by 1.2% vs. 4.2% while agitation was reported in 2 (0.8%) vs. 7 (2.7%). In study 9766-
CL-0103 37 (25.3%) had psychiatric AESIs of interest, including 8.9% with insomnia, 6.8% with confusional 
state and 3.4% with somnolence. 
Potential Ocular Toxicity 
In study 9766-CL-0104 8.2% isavuconazole and 16.6% voriconazole patients had ocular AESIs, reflecting the 
rates of visual impairment (1.6% vs. 7.3%), vision blurred (1.6% vs. 2.3%), visual acuity reduced (0.4% vs. 
2.3%), eye pain (0.4% vs. 1.5%) and cataract (0.4% vs. 1.2%). In study 9766-CL-0103, 8 (5.5%) had an 
ocular AESI, including 2 with unilateral blindness. 
Potential Anaphylaxis and Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCAR) 
In study 9766-CL-0104 these TEAEs occurred in 1.9% per treatment group but there were no cases in study 
9766-CL-0103, see following table:

Since it was however not clear whether or how many individual TEAEs potentially representing 
hypersensitivity occurred concurrently in the same patients, the applicant was requested to gather all 
possible TEAEs representing hypersensitivity reactions, including non-serious rashes, and provide a review of 
concurrent occurrences and numbers of patients involved by treatment in study 9766-CL-0104. There were 
no imbalances in the incidence of TEAEs representing a potential hypersensitivity between isavuconazole and 
voriconazole. 
Injection Site Reactions 
In study 9766-CL-0104 infusion/injection site reactions were reported in 11/257 (4.3%) in the isavuconazole 
and 4/259 (1.5%) in the voriconazole group. The rate was similar (5%) for isavuconazole in study 9766-CL-
0103. 
Potential Infusion-Related Reactions 
In study 9766-CL-0104 there was no difference between isavuconazole (70/257, 27.2%) and voriconazole 
(76/259, 29.3%) for TEAEs commonly associated with infusion-related reactions that occurred within 48 h of 
an IV dose. However, the Applicant was asked to present the data on infusion reactions in the isavuconazole 
groups in terms of what is known about the correct use of recommended filters in patients who did and did 
not have such events. It is concluded that the incidence of infusion-site reactions in patients administered 
isavuconazole with and without a protocol-specified filter is comparable and no relevant differences were 
identified between the groups. Dyspnoea occurred during IV infusion of isavuconazole and may be an 
element of an infusion reaction syndrome. An adequate warning has been included in the SmPC. 
Torsades de pointes 
In study 9766-CL-0104 5.8% isavuconazole and 7.3% voriconazole patients had a TEAE in the torsade de 
pointes SMQ. Most frequent were syncope (2.7% vs. 0.8%), loss of consciousness (1.2% vs. 0), ECG 
prolonged QT (0.8% vs. 3.1%) and cardiac arrest (0.4% vs. 2.3%), see following table:

consciousness were observed, although it was acknowledged that these numbers were overall small and the 
imbalances may have occurred by chance. The applicant was asked to provide details of when these events 
occurred in relation to dosing and whether all 3 with LOC were among the 7 with syncope. From the 
applicant’s response it became clear that the 3 patients with loss of consciousness and were not among the 7 
patients with syncope. These events seem not to be directly related to dosing. The applicant’s conclusion, 
that syncope and loss of consciousness does not constitute a safety signal that would need to be addressed 
further in the SmPC and/or the Risk Management Plan, is endorsed by CHMP. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Overall TEAE Leading to Death (Study 9766-CL-0104) 
Fatal SAEs occurred in 24.1% isavuconazole and 27.8% voriconazole patients and those TEAEs leading to 
death that occurred in ≥ 2% were septic shock (3.1% vs. 1.5%), sepsis (2.7% vs. 1.9%), respiratory failure 
(2.3% vs. 2.3%), acute myeloid leukaemia (1.2% vs. 2.7%) and multi-organ failure (0.4% vs. 2.3%), see 
following table:

Sorting order: alphabetical by system organ class and preferred term 
Seven isavuconazole patients and 6 voriconazole patients had fatal SAEs considered by the investigators to 
be drug-related. Those occurring in more than one patient were cardiac arrest (voriconazole: 2 patients) and 
fungal infection (isavuconazole: 2 patients), see following table:

Table 64 
Study Drug-Related Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Death in the 
Phase 3 Controlled Population (9766-CL-0104) 
Although the overall proportion of TEAEs leading to death (isavuconazole 24.1%; voriconazole 27.8%) and of 
study drug related TEAE’s leading to death (isavuconazole 2.7%; voriconazole 2.3%) was similar between 
treatment groups, there were differences in the SOCs “Infections and infestations” and “Neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unspecified”.  
More patients in the voriconazole treated group died due to the underlying (malignant) disease 
(isavuconazole: 10/257 (3.9%) vs voriconazole: 21/259 (8.1%), whereas more patients in the isavuconazole 
treated group died from infections and infestations (isavuconazole: 28/257 (10.9%) vs voriconazole: 18/259 
(6.9%). Study drug-related TEAE leading to death encompassed 3 patients that died due to “(fungal) 
infections and infestations” and all were isavuconazole treated. This raises the posibility that isavuconazole 
patients might be “undertreated” and needed a increased dose of isavuconazole. However, the non-clinical 
data (single dose toxicity) suggests a steep dose response curve and increased dosages could possibly lead 
to a higher incidence of adverse events.  
Study Drug Related Serious TEAEs (Study 9766-CL-0104) 
Overall, a similar proportion of isavuconazole (28/257, 10.9%) and voriconazole (29/259, 11.2%) treated 
patients had study drug related serious TEAEs. Most of the study drug related serious TEAEs were single 
occurrences.  
An important difference was observed between treatment groups for study drug-related serious TEAEs in the 
respiratory SOC (isavuconazole: 9/257, 3.5%; voriconazole: 2/259, 0.8%). The following study drug related 
serious TEAEs by preferred term were reported in the respiratory SOC: respiratory failure (isavuconazole 4 
patients; voriconazole: 2 patients), dyspnea (isavuconazole 3 patients), acute respiratory failure 
(isavuconazole 2 patients), respiratory distress (isavuconazole 1 patient) and tachypnea (isavuconazole 1 
patient). 
Four subjects experienced serious adverse events in the phase 1 studies (0.4%, 4/1001), 1 subject received 
a single dose of isavuconazole and 3 subjects received multiple doses.

Phase 3 Uncontrolled population (study 9766-CL-0103) 
There were 42 deaths (28.8%) through 28 days after the last dose of isavuconazole and 47 deaths in total 
(32.2%) with higher rates for RI vs. NRI subsets. Overall, 30.1% of patients experienced TEAEs leading to 
death (35.6% RI; 26.4% NRI). The most common TEAEs leading to death by PT that occurred in ≥ 2% were 
septic shock (3 RI and 0 NRI), malignant neoplasm progression (0 vs. 2) and pneumonia (0 vs. 2). One 
patient had a fatal SAE considered drug-related by the Investigator, which concerned possibly related severe 
septic shock 7 days after starting isavuconazole. The DRC assessed this patient as having no IFD.  
The most common SAEs were infections and infestations (37.7%; 42.4% RI and 34.5% NRI). RI patients also 
had higher rates of cardiac SAEs (10.3% vs. 2.3%) and renal and urinary disorders (11.9% vs. 2.3%) (see 
following table). The most SAEs were renal failure acute (5.5%), pneumonia (4.8%), septic shock (4.1%), 
respiratory failure (3.4%) and abdominal pain. Overall, 8.9% had a drug-related SAE, of which few were 
experienced by more than one patient.

Laboratory findings 
Chemistry 
In study 9766-CL-0104 no clinically important mean changes from baseline to end of treatment were noted. 
The number (%) of patients with a shift from one category at baseline to another category for the highest or 
lowest post-baseline value was generally similar between treatment groups. Fewer isavuconazole patients 
had a decrease in calcium or an increase in AST, GGT or ALP, see following table: 
In study 9766-CL-0103 the findings were similar to those described with isavuconazole above although there 
were some differences between the RI and NRI subgroups, as would be expected.

In study 9766-CL-0104 fewer isavuconazole patients experienced increases in transaminases alone or 
concurrently with increases in total bilirubin. Also, fewer isavuconazole patients had increases > ULN at EOT. 
One isavuconazole vs. 7 voriconazole patients had ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN. No 
isavuconazole but 2 voriconazole patients had ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with ALP < 2 x ULN and total bilirubin 
> 2 x ULN at EOT. 
For all post-baseline results 3 isavuconazole and 7 voriconazole patients had ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and ALP

Haematology 
In the CSRs for study 9766-CL-0104 and 9766-CL-0103 and in the summary of safety it was stated only that 
changes from baseline in mean haematology parameters did not reveal any remarkable trends in either 
treatment group and that the clinical relevance of observed changes is difficult to ascertain due to the 
common presence of underlying haematological malignancies and BMTs. However, the CSRs did contain full 
tabulations of the haematology data that were extremely lengthy and difficult to interpret. The applicant has 
provided new overview tables, as shown below:

The results from these tables do not indicate any relevant differences between the two treatment groups. 
ECGs 
In study 9766-CL-0104 the mean changes from baseline for heart rate, PR, RR, QRS, QT and QTcB were 
small and similar between treatment groups. At EOT the mean change from baseline in QTcF was ˗6.7 ms in 
the isavuconazole group and 2.4 ms in the voriconazole group. The analysis of categorised QTcF values at 
EOT showed that fewer isavuconazole patients had QTcF values > 450 ms (7/250, 2.8% vs. 17/252, 6.7% for 
voriconazole) and more isavuconazole patients had values <360 ms (10.8% vs. 7.5%). No patients had QTcF 
> 500 ms and only 1 isavuconazole patients had a value <300 ms. Categorised changes from baseline in 
QTcF based on extreme values showed that fewer isavuconazole patients had increases from baseline in QTcF 
> 30 ms and > 60 ms at EOT or post-baseline. 
Safety in special populations 
Elderly people 
The incidence of TEAEs for elderly people (stratified for age) is presented in the following table: 
Table 72  
Study  9766-CL-0104/9766-CL-0103:  Overview  of  treatment-emergent  adverse 
events in various adverse events categories (Safety population) 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 143/162 
 
  
  
 
 
There appears to be no increased risk of developing specific age-related side effects. 
General conclusions with regard to special populations 
 
In study 0104 the AE profile did not change substantially across age groups ≤65 vs. >65 years although 
the latter accounted for only one-fifth of the study population. For individual SOCs there was no 
consistent pattern by age and in some cases rates by age group went in the opposite direction for 
isavuconazole vs. voriconazole. On the basis of the available safety data no dose adjustment of 
isavuconazole is considered necessary in elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age). There were too few aged 
≥75 years (10 isavuconazole and 7 voriconazole) for comment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For most SOCs there was no substantial difference between genders. There were a few SOCs in which 
rates were higher in women (e.g. hepatobiliary disorders in the isavuconazole group). 
In study 0104 the treatment differences observed for the overall analysis of TEAEs were consistent with 
those of the white and Asian subgroups.  
BMI category (< 25 [the majority], 26 - < 30 and ≥ 30 kg/m2) did not have a major or at least no 
consistent impact on the safety profiles although few were ≥ 30 kg/m2. 
For those with allogeneic HSCT/BMT status, uncontrolled malignancy or haematological malignancy the 
same overall pattern of treatment differences was observed although the rates varied by patient subset. 
In study 0104 the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar regardless of treatment duration and no 
difference was observed between treatment groups. The incidence TEAEs in the blood, gastrointestinal, 
immune, musculoskeletal, nervous system and skin disorders SOCs was higher in both treatment groups 
for patients who received > 42 to < 84 days. Numbers who received >84 days were small (24 
isavuconazole and 20 voriconazole), which limits the comparisons made. 
Use of isavuconazole in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided. 
Isavuconazole is not removed by hemodialysis. Treatment of isavuconazole overdose should be 
supportive. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase 3 Controlled population (study 9766-CL-0104)  
Fewer isavuconazole patients permanently discontinued study drug due to TEAEs. In particular, isavuconazole 
treated patients had fewer TEAEs causing discontinuation in the hepatobiliary and psychiatric disorders SOCs 
(see following table). Drug-related TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug occurred in 
21/257 (8.2%) in the isavuconazole vs 35/259 (13.5%) in the voriconazole group. The most common of 
these TEAEs were rash (0 vs. 3) and visual hallucination (0 vs. 3).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the observed safety profile of isavuconazole was in accordance with that expected for an azole 
antifungal medicinal product.  
For the final dosing regimen used, the comparative safety data available from study 9766-CL-0104 indicated 
that the safety profile of isavuconazole compared favourably with that of voriconazole. In most SOCs 
isavuconazole had numerically lower rates of TEAEs, the differences observed for the SOCs eye disorders and 
hepatobiliary disorders being statistically significant. This difference was however difficult to interpret since 
the safety database of isavuconazole was rather limited and since the safety profile heavily relied on the 
results of the controlled study 9766-CL-0104.

There was no excess of deaths and fatal SAEs in the isavuconazole group and there were no apparent safety 
aspects for which isavuconazole was worse than voriconazole, except for the fact that a significant higher 
proportion of isavuconazole-treated patients than voriconazole-treated patients experienced study drug 
related TEAEs within the respiratory SOC (6.2% vs. 1.9%), reflecting the corresponding observed rates of 
dyspnoea (8, 3.1% vs. 2, 0.8%) and other imbalances in respiratory SAEs. Based on the case descriptions no 
direct relationship between the isavuconazole intake and the incidence of serious TEAEs in the respiratory 
SOC was apparent. In 8 out of the 9 described cases, underlying disease appeared to have played an 
(important) role. In one patient, the serious TEAE “acute respiratory failure” was considered as “possibly 
related”, since there was a temporal relationship between the administration of isavuconazole and the onset 
of the event, and no clear alternative aetiologies could be identified. Nevertehless, it was not possible to 
conclude that the administration of isavuconazole in itself might lead to dyspnoea. 
The incidence of infusion-site reactions in patients administered isavuconazole with and without a protocol-
specified filter was comparable and no relevant differences were identified between the groups. Dyspnoea 
occurred during IV infusion of isavuconazole and may be an element of an infusion reaction syndrome. An 
adequate warning has been included in the SmPC. 
No imbalance in the incidence of TEAEs representing potential hypersensitivities was observed between 
isavuconazole and voriconazole. 
Loss of consciousness and syncope seem not to be directly related to dosing and these events do not 
constitute safety signals that would need to be addressed further in the SmPC and/or the Risk Management 
Plan. 
No increased risk of developing specific age-related side effects was noted. 
In the uncontrolled study 9766-CL-0103 the difference in AE rates between those with and without renal 
impairment is expected. Comparing rates between isavuconazole groups in the two pivotal studies was 
however considered not informative due to the differences in the study populations. 
Isavuconazole was generally associated with fewer marked laboratory abnormalities than voriconazole but it 
is important to note that it does appear to share the toxicity profile of other triazoles, including DILI. 
Substantial proportions of healthy subjects showed increases in serum creatinine in phase 1 studies 
(258/1001 subjects had a ≥ 25% increase from baseline in serum creatinine and 15/1001 had a ≥ 50% 
increase) although in the phase 3 study 9766-CL-0104, rates for isavuconazole were comparable with those 
for voriconazole.  
Overview tables on haematology also did not indicate any relevant differences between the two treatment 
groups. 
2.6.1.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
CHMP agreed that the safety profile of isavuconazole, as observed when using the posology recommended in 
the Cresemba SmPC is generally considered reassuring.

The clinical data for 
isavuconazole in the treatment 
of mucormycosis are based on 
one non-controlled clinical 
study in 37 patients. 
For individual Mucorales 
species, the clinical efficacy 
data are very limited, often to 
one or two patients. 
Susceptibility data were 
available in only a small 
subset of cases. 
The registry will collect 
further information, including

SmPC for isavuconazole 200 mg powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion Section 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other 
handling (i.v. formulation)  includes: 
None 
Dilution and  administration 
After reconstitution, the entire content of the reconstituted 
concentrate should be removed from the vial and added to an 
infusion bag containing at least 250 mL of either sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/ml (5%) dextrose 
solution. The infusion solution contains approximately 1.5 mg/ml 
isavuconium sulfate (corresponding to approximately 0.8 mg 
isavuconazole per mL). After the reconstituted concentrate is 
further diluted, the diluted solution may show fine white-to-
translucent particulates of isavuconazole that do not sediment (but 
will be removed by in-line filtration). The diluted solution should 
be mixed gently, or the bag should be rolled to minimise the 
formation of particulates. Unnecessary vibration or vigorous 
shaking of the solution should be avoided.  The solution for 
infusion must be administered via an infusion set with an in-line 
filter (pore size 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm) made of polyether sulfone (PES).  
CRESEMBA should not be infused into the same line or cannula 
concomitantly with other intraveneous products.

isavuconazole 200 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
includes:  
Method of administration 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the 
medicinal product 
CRESEMBA must be reconstituted and then further diluted to a 
concentration corresponding to approximately 0.8 mg/mL 
isavuconazole prior to administration by intravenous infusion over 
a minimum of 1 hour to reduce the risk for infusion-related 
reactions. The infusion must be administered via an infusion set 
with an in-line filter with a microporous membrane made of 
polyethersulfone (PES) and with a pore size of 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm. 
CRESEMBA must only be given as an intravenous  infusion. 
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use includes: 
Infusion-related reactions (not relevant for capsules) 
During intravenous administration of isavuconazole, infusion-
related reactions including hypotension, dyspnea, dizziness, 
paraesthesia, nausea, and headache were reported. The infusion 
should be stopped if these reactions occur.

SmPC Section 4.3 Contraindications includes the following 
contraindication: 
CRESEMBA is contraindicated in patients with familial short QT 
syndrome.  
SmPC Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  includes 
the following under Cardiovascular: 
QT shortening 
In a QT study in healthy human subjects, isavuconazole shortened 
the QTc interval in a concentration-related manner. For the 200 mg 
dosing regimen, the least squares mean (LSM) difference from 
placebo was 13.1 ms at 2 hours post dose [90% CI: 17.1, 9.1 ms]. 
Increasing the dose to 600 mg resulted in an LSM difference from 
placebo of 24.6 ms at 2 hours post dose [90% CI: 28.7, 20.4 ms]. 
Caution is warranted when prescribing CRESEMBAto patients 
taking other medicinal products known to decrease the QT interval, 
such as Rufinamide.  
SmPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects includes: 
Electrocardiogram QT shortened is included as an uncommon ADR

SmPC Section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation includes: 
Pregnancy 
None 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of 
isavuconazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity.  
The potential risk for humans is unknown.  CRESEMBA must not 
be used during pregnancy except in patients with severe or 
potentially life-threatening fungal infections in whom 
isavuconazole may be used if the anticipated benefits outweigh the 
possible risks to the foetus. 
CRESEMBA is not recommended for women of childbearing 
potential who are not using contraception. 
SmPC Section 5.3 Pre-clinical safety data includes: 
In rats and rabbits, isavuconazole at systemic exposures below the 
therapeutic level were associated with dose-related increases in the 
incidence of skeletal anomalies (rudimentary supernumerary ribs) 
in offspring. In rats, a dose-related increase in the incidence of 
zygomatic arch fusion was also noted in offspring. 
Administration of isavuconazole to rats at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day 
(2.3-fold the human maintenance dose [200 mg] based on 
mg/m2/day) during pregnancy through the weaning period showed 
an increased perinatal mortality of the pups. In utero exposure to 
the active moiety, isavuconazole, had no effect on the fertility of 
the surviving pups.

SmPC Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties includes: 
Mechanism(s) of resistance 
Reduced susceptibility to triazole antifungal agents has been 
associated with mutations in the fungal cyp51A and cyp51B genes 
coding for the target protein lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase 
involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. Fungal strains with reduced in 
vitro susceptibility for isavuconazole have been reported, and cross-
resistance with voriconazole and other triazole antifungal agents 
cannot be excluded. 
Breakpoints 
Interpretive criteria for isavuconazole for Aspergillus species are 
applicable to tests performed by the European Committee on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [EUCAST, 2014] (Definitive 
Document E.DEF 9.2).  
EUCAST MIC breakpoints are defined for the following species 
(susceptible S; resistant R):  
  Aspergillus fumigatus:   S ≤ 1 mg/L, R > 1 mg/L  
  Aspergillus nidulans:  S ≤ 0.25 mg/L, R > 0.25 mg/L 
  Aspergillus terreus: 
 S ≤ 1 mg/L, R > 1 mg/L 
There are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for 
other Aspergillus species.

SmPC Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties will include: 
Hepatic impairment 
After a single 100 mg dose of isavuconazole was administered to 
32 patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic insufficiency 
and 32 patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic 
insufficiency (16 intravenous and 16 oral patients per Child-Pugh 
Class), the least square mean systemic exposure (AUC) increased 
64% in the Child Pugh Class A group and 84% in the Child-Pugh 
Class B group relative to 32 age and weight matched healthy 
subjects with normal hepatic function. Mean plasma concentrations 
(Cmax) were 2% lower in the Child-Pugh Class A group and 30% 
lower in the Child-Pugh Class B group. The population 
pharmacokinetic evaluation of isavuconazole in healthy subjects 
and patients with mild and moderate hepatic dysfunction 
demonstrated that the mild and moderate hepatic impairment 
populations had 40% and 48% lower isavuconazole clearance (CL) 
values, respectively, compared to the healthy population.  
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate 
hepatic impairment.  
CRESEMBA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Use in these patients is not 
recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to

Limitations of the clinical data 
The clinical data for isavuconazole in the treatment of 
mucormycosis are limited to one prospective non-controlled 
clinical study in 37 patients with proven or probable 
mucormycosis who received isavuconazole for primary 
treatment, or because other antifungal treatments 
(predominantly amphotericin B) were inappropriate.

For individual Mucorales species, the clinical efficacy data are 
very limited, often to one or two patients (see section 5.1).  
Susceptibility data were available in only a small subset of 
cases. These data indicate that concentrations of isavuconazole 
required for inhibition in vitro are very variable between 
genera/species within the order of Mucorales, and generally 
higher than concentrations required to inhibit Aspergillus 
species. It should be noted that there was no dose-finding study 
in mucormycosis, and patients were administered the same 
dose of isavuconazole as was used for the treatment of invasive 
aspergillosis. 
SmPC Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties includes: 
Treatment of mucormycosis 
In an open-label non-controlled study, 37 patients with proven 
or probable mucormycosis received isavuconazole at the same 
dose regimen as that used to treat invasive aspergillosis. 
Median treatment duration was 84 days for the overall 
mucormycosis patient population, and 102 days for the 21 
patients not previously treated for mucormycosis. For patients 
with probable or proven mucormycosis as defined by the 
independent Data Review Committee (DRC), all-cause 
mortality at Day 84 was 43.2% (16/37) for the overall patient 
population, 42.9% (9/21) for mucormycosis patients receiving 
isavuconazole as primary treatment, and 43.8% (7/16) for 
mucormycosis patients receiving isavuconazole who were 
refractory to, or intolerant of, prior antifungal therapy (mainly 
amphotericin B-based treatments). The DRC-assessed overall 
success rate at EOT was 11/35 (31.4%), with 5 patients 
considered completely cured and 6 patients partially cured. A 
stable response was observed in an additional 10/35 patients 
(28.6%). In 9 patients with mucormycosis due to Rhizopus 
spp., 4 patients showed a favourable response to isavuconazole. 
In 5 patients with mucormycosis due to Rhizomucor spp., no 
favourable responses were observed. The clinical experience in 
other species is very limited (Lichtheimia spp. n=2, 
Cunninghamella spp. n=1, Actinomucor elegans n=1).

requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet for hard capsules 
submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet for 
the powder for concentrate for solution for infusion has been submitted by the applicant and has been found 
acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Cresemba 100 mg hard capsules. The bridging report submitted by the 
applicant has been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Cresemba (isavuconazole) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
This application is primarily based on the results from two pivotal clinical trials, study 9766-CL-0104 relevant 
for the aspergillosis indication and study 9766-CL-0103, relevant for the mucormycosis indication.  
Invasive aspergillosis 
Non-inferiority of isavuconazole relative to voriconazole (which was considered an appropriate comparator by 
CHMP) was shown for the primary efficacy endpoint “crude rate of all-cause mortality through day 42 (in 
ITT)” in study 9766-CL-0104. Mortality in the isavuconazole treated patients was 18.6% (48/258 patients) 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 155/162 
 
  
  
compared to 20.2% (52/258) of voriconazole treated patients. This treatment difference of -1.0% (95% CI: 
[-7.759, 5.683]) in favour of isavuconazole was well within the predefined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The 
results for the key secondary efficacy endpoint “DRC-assessed overall response at EOT (in mITT)” were very 
similar for the isavuconazole (51/143 patients, 35%) and voriconazole-treated patients (46/129 patients, 
36,4%), resulting in a treatment difference of 1.6 (95%CI: [-9.336, 12.572]). This endpoint was considered 
more relevant by CHMP than all-cause mortality, as mortality could have resulted from causes unrelated to 
IFD in these severe ill patients and because mortality associated with IFD was difficult to discriminate in 
these complex cases. Analyses of mortality rates and DRC-assessed clinical and mycological success were 
generally consistent. In addition, in the myITT patients with aspergillosis that was not diagnosed based solely 
on GM, the success rates at EOT were very similar. 
Mucormycosis 
Study 9766-CL-0103 was an open-label single arm study with the primary objective to describe the efficacy 
of isavuconazole in the treatment of 37 patients with IFD caused by rare moulds, yeasts or dimorphic fungi  
(mITT population) and 24 patients with invasive aspergillosis and renal impairment (20 patients, 4 patients 
had normal renal function). At EOT the “DRC-assessed overall response rate” was 11/35 (31.4%) for 
Mucorales, with 5/35 (14.3%) of patients assessed to be a “complete success” and 6/35 (17.1%) assessed to 
be a “partial success”. Two patients were still actively participating in the study and were not included in this 
analysis at the EOT. All-cause mortality was 37.8% (14/37) at day 42 and 43.2% (16/37) at day 84. The 
mortality rate with the use of isavuconazole was comparable to that reported in literature for the current 
standard of care, liposomal amphotericin B. Moreover, from the additional analyses presented by the 
applicant, it appeared that the overall success rates in study 9766-CL-0103 were also consistent with the 
clinical response rates (complete cure, partial cure, stable response or failure) observed in external control 
studies performed with amphotericin-B. The CHMP agreed that all the above, along with the additional data 
provided by the Applicant during the procedure on the compassionate use give support the indication 
“treatment of adult patients with mucormycosis for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate”. CHMP also noted 
the adequate tolerability profile of isavuconazole, enabling long term treatment.  
Intravenous and oral formulation of isavuconazole 
Isavuconazole (available as IV and oral dosage forms) offers an added treatment option for renally impaired 
patients with invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. The advantage of the isavuconazole i.v. formulation is 
that it can be used in renally impaired patients, whereas voriconazole i.v. (the current standard of care in 
invasive aspergillosis) has to be avoided in moderate to severe renally impaired patients (creatinine clearance 
< 50 ml/min), because of the accumulation of its intravenous vehicle sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin 
(SBECD).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Aspergillosis 
CHMP noted that no definite conclusions could be made with regard to the dose–effect relation for 
isavuconazole, as no formal dose-finding studies were conducted. In addition, the majority of the myITT 
patients had a diagnosis based on the galactomannan test (GM) only. Therefore outcomes by MIC were 
available for a relatively small number of patients, and in these a threshold for response based on MIC could 
not be observed. Due to the fact that the PK sampling was also considered not adequate to support good 
quality analyses of the exposure-response relationship that take into account individual patient AUC/MIC 
ratios (i.e. PopPK-predicted AUC from individual sparse PK data and the MIC documented for that patient’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 156/162 
 
  
  
pathogen) it was not possible to conclude on the highest MICs that may be treatable with the recommended 
dose regimen of isavuconazole.  
Asian patients had a numerically lower success rate in the isavuconazole group (25.9%, 7/27) than in the 
voriconazole treatment group (48.6%, 17/35). From the additional responses provided by the applicant 
during the procedure, it was concluded that the observed differences in response rates between Asian and 
non-Asian patients could not be explained by drug exposure. It was noted that out of six Asian patients with 
MIC values available, all MICs were below 2 µg/mL. CHMP agreed therefore that it was unlikely that 
resistance to isavuconazole would explain the data observed for the overall response at EOT. Moreover, the 
differences in favour of voriconazole were not consistent across the Asian countries; they were apparent in 
Thailand and South Korea, but not in China and India. Therefore CHMP agreed that no definitive conclusions 
could be drawn on this point. A potential ethnicity effect cannot be excluded at present and it is included as 
missing information in the RMP.

For Mucorales, no relation between the MIC and the probability of clinical response could be observed. The 
selected dose and dose regimen were not sufficiently substantiated, complicating the interpretation of the 
clinical efficacy data in study 9766-CL-0103. Further uncertainties encountered by CHMP in the interpretation 
of the observed results concern the absence of a formal dose selection study, no preclinical data supporting a 
PK/PD relationship, and the absence of a clear relationship between MICs and clinical responses. 
The clinical data are confined to only a narrow range of organisms that belong to the order of Mucorales. 
Where MICs are available, these suggest that the dose may be insufficient. In vitro data indicated poor 
activity against several Mucorales specie. In addition, for patients with positive cultures and with MIC data 
available, the vast majority of the observed MICs were at least 8 µg/mL, whereas the expected mean trough 
value was only approximately 4 mg/L. The generally higher MIC may reflect the somewhat lower 
susceptibility of Mucorales to isavuconazole. The data suggest that some of the genera/species within the 
order Mucorales may be inherently not susceptible to isavuconazole.  
CHMP noted that the applicant had based the external control data on the “standard care” liposomal 
amphotericin B by providing a literature review and a Fungiscope matched-control analysis. The mortality 
rate associated with the use of isavuconazole seemed compable to that reported for standard care liposomal 
amphotericin B in the treatment of mucormycosis; however CHMP acknowledged the limitations of this 
analysis, that was based on historical controls from the literature. 
The data to put the DRC-assessed overall response at EOT (considered the most relevant endpoint) into 
context are even more sparse. It was noted that most pivotal studies performed with amphotericin B were 
old and did not comply with the recommendations published by EORTC/MSG -only the studies by Shoham 
(2010), Xhaard (2012) and Lanternier (2012) were considered appropriate for an external comparison of the 
overall response rates with those obtained from study 9766-CL-0103. 
The complex patient population and the absence of a justification for the dose selection made the 
interpretation of the clinical data very difficult. The low number of patients enrolled (explained by the 
difficulty of enrolling patients in a study for this rare disease), the open-label single-arm design of the study, 
the heterogeneity of the included patient group in terms of the observed baseline characteristics, the 
interaction with other interventions (surgery, correction of predisposing conditions), and the lack of a direct 
comparison with other antifungals made the evaluation of the attributable efficacy of isavuconazole in 
mucormycosis very difficult.

Resistance development of Aspergillus  
CHMP also noted that the applicant’s conclusion that there was no signal of resistance development during 
treatment was based on only 2 patients, whereas substantial treatment failures occurred in overall population 
enrolled, and that no data at baseline and/or follow up MICs were available. CHMP could not conclude on the 
data from the 2 patients with regard to the potential of resistance development and supported that this issue 
is addressed in the Rosk Management Plan.  
Intravenous formulation of isavuconazole 
In the phase 3 studies in-line filters were to be used, but some sites used the wrong pore size and some 
patients received the unfiltered drug. However, during the assessment, based on the data provided by the 
applicant, CHMP concluded that these did not have an impact on the observed clinical efficacy of Cresemba. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common treatment-related adverse reactions were nausea (26.1%), vomiting (24.8%), diarrhoea 
(21.8%), headache (17.1%), elevated liver chemistry tests (16.9%), hypokalaemia (15.6%), abdominal pain 
(15.1%), dyspnoea (14.9%), oedema peripheral (14.4%) and constipation (12.9%). The adverse reactions 
which most often led to permanent discontinuation of isavuconazole treatment during clinical studies were 
confusional state (0.7%), acute renal failure (0.7%), increased blood bilirubin (0.5%), convulsion (0.5%), 
dyspnoea (0.5%), epilepsy (0.5%), respiratory failure (0.5%) and vomiting (0.5%). 
Isavuconazole is a substrate of CYP3A4 and contraindications are included in the SmPC for the concomitant 
use with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole and with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers. In 
addition, due to the fact that isavuconazole induces UGT and CYP2D6, decreased plasma levels of UGT 
substrates and CYP2B6 substrates are expected, which may affect the efficacy of medicinal products which 
are UGT/CYP2B6 substrates. CHMP therefore agreed to include an adequate wording in the Cresemba SmPC, 
describing these interactions.  
Overall, the observed safety profile of isavuconazole is similar to the safety profile that would be expected for 
an azole antifungal medicinal product and generally compared favourably with that of voriconazole. 
Nevertheless, some potential ADRs were of a severe nature and CHMP agreed that these needed to be 
reflected in the Cresemba SmPC.  
In most other SOCs isavuconazole had a numerically lower rate of TEAEs, the differences observed for the 
SOCs eye disorders and hepatobiliary disorders being statistically significant lower than in the voriconazole 
arm. A significant higher proportion of isavuconazole-treated patients when compared with voriconazole-
treated patients experienced study drug related TEAEs within the respiratory SOC. 
Identified risks for isavuconazole are elevated liver transaminases and infusion related reactions. 
Elevated liver transaminases have been reported with the use of isavuconazole in clinical studies, although 
not requiring study drug discontinuation. Hepatotoxicity is also known to occur with other triazoles. A warning 
in on the use of Cresemba in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment was included in the SmPC.  
Infusion-related reactions have been reported with isavuconazole.  During intravenous infusion of 
isavuconazole, hypotension, dyspnea, chills, dizziness, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, nausea, and headache 
were reported.  The Cresemba SmPC includes a recommendation for an infusion of a minimum of one hour, 
and a relevant wording in section 4.4.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Although in most SOCs isavuconazole had a numerically lower rate of TEAEs, CHMP agreed that this aspect 
was difficult to interpret since the safety database of isavuconazole was rather limited (403 patients) and 
mainly relied on the results of the controlled study 9766-CL-0104 (257 patients). It was therefore 
acknowledged by CHMP that only uncommon or more frequent events could be described by the current 
generated information. Although the isavuconazole safety profile appeared to have been the expected one, 
the risk of the most important expected issues, such as hepatotoxicity, and the risk of unexpected rare 
issues, such as carcinogenicity, could not be fully elucidated based on the generated  preclinical and clinical 
datasets. 
Intravenous formulation of isavuconazole 
In the phase 3 studies in-line filters were to be used but some sites used the wrong pore size and some 
patients received unfiltered drug. From the two analyses performed, for both studies separately, no 
occurrence of an embolic or thrombotic-type AE was observed.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Despite the current available antifungal therapies (AFTs) for invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis, both 
diseases are life-threatening and still associated with high mortality rates. There is an urgent unmet medical 
need for new effective antifungal drugs for the treatment of the invasive fungal diseases. 
Aspergillosis 
Isavuconazole is a new triazole antifungal agent that showed non-inferiority relative to voriconazole, the 
current standard of care for the treatment of aspergillosis in adults. From the data submitted by the 
applicant, CHMP could not conclude whether isavuconazole had an added clinical benefit over other tri-azoles 
in the treatment of aspergilosis. It was however noted that study drug-related TEAEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug were less frequent in the isavuconazole group (8.2%) compared with the 
voriconazole group (13.5%). This apparent safety advantage of isavuconazole may constitute a benefit for 
isavuconazole in the treatment of aspergillosis.  
Mucormycosis 
Mucormycosis is a very difficult to treat disease, especially when located at certain body sites. The current 
standard of care for mucormycosis is liposomal amphotericin B. 
The open-label study 9766-CL-0103, together with the external control data on the current standard of care 
liposomal amphotericin B and with the data obtained from the compassionate use cases support the 
indication “treatment of mucormycosis in adult patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate”. 
Isavuconazole is well tolerated, enabling long term treatment in renal impaired patients. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Aspergillosis 
Like for other azoles, the dose-response relationship for isavuconazole is complex and ambiguous. However, 
CHMP agreed that the efficacy results of the performed active-controlled pivotal trial were reassuring in this 
respect.  Study 9766-CL-0104 has shown non-inferiority of isavuconazole relative to voriconazole (which is 
Assessment report  
EMA/596950/2015 
Page 159/162 
 
  
  
the standard of care for the treatment of aspergillosis) regarding all-cause mortality. The results of all 
additional efficacy analyses of the pivotal trial, including the key secondary endpoint DRC-assessed overall 
response, were generally in line with the main findings. The safety profile of isavuconazole appears to be 
similar that of voriconazole. CHMP noted also that in most SOCs, isavuconazole had a numerically lower rate 
of TEAEs. CHMP acknowledged the differences observed for the SOCs “eye disorders” and “hepatobiliary 
disorders” which were lower than with voriconazole were statistically significant, but agreed that this should 
be carefully interpreted, considering the limited safety database of isavuconazole.  
Mucormycosis 
CHMP agreed that from the public health perspective, new effective medicines for the treatment of 
mucormycosis are needed. The open-label study 9766-CL-0103, together with the external control data 
(mortality rates and clinical response rates) based on the current standard of care (liposomal amphotericin B) 
and on compassionate use cases are supportive for the indication “treatment of adult patients with 
mucormycosis for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate”.  
The current standard of care for mucormycosis is (liposomal) amphotericin B. (Liposomal) amphotericin B is 
the only medicinal product that is authorized for the primary treatment of mucormycosis in the EU.  
L-amB has the broadest spectrum of antifungal activity against the species of the Mucorales order and its 
clinical efficacy in mucormycosis is by far the best documented; this medicine has therefore a first line 
indication for the treatment of mucormycosis. Nevertheless, in those case where the disease is refractory to 
L-AmB, as well as in the case of intolerance to L-amB after previous therapy with this medicine 
(amphotericin-B has known adverse renal effects, especially in the case of long-term treatment), 
isavuconazole has been shown to have beneficial effects in patients infected by at least some of the 
Mucorales species (f.e. Rhizopus spp, Actinomucor elegans, Lichtheimia corymbifera). Isavuconazole is well 
tolerated, enabling long term treatment in renally impaired patients and provides an alternative option for 
mucormycosis patients with renal impairment and to patients not responding to treatment with Amphotericin-
B. Isavuconazole is available as an IV and an oral formulation which are easily switchable when clinically 
indicated. 
Both indications 
The benefit shown together with the favourable safety profile of isavuconazole in both indications outweighs 
the existing uncertainties, especially in the treatment of mucormycosis. Isavuconazole is well tolerated, 
enabling long term treatment in renal impaired patients. 
CHMP therefore considered that the benefit-risk balance for Cresemba in the treatment of invasive 
aspergillosis in adults and in the treatment of mucormycosis in adult patients for whom amphotericin B is 
inappropriate is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Cresemba in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in adults and of mucormycosis in 
adult patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1) is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

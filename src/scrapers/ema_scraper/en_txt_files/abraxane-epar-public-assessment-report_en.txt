SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women. The world-wide incidence of breast cancer in the 
year  2002  was  estimated  at  1,151,298  cases;  mortality  in  the  same  year  was  estimated  at  410,712 
deaths (GLOBOCAN 2002). The incidence of breast cancer increases with age, doubling about every 
10 years until menopause, when the rate of increase slows (McPherson, Steel et al. 2000). 
Most  patients  with  breast  cancer  (about  90%)  are  diagnosed  with  operable  disease  i.e.  overt  cancer 
manifestations confined to the breast and the axillary lymph nodes. The extension of the disease to the 
overlying  skin,  the  underlying  chest  wall  or  to  more  distal  nodes  is  classified  as  locally  advanced 
disease. Overt metastases to other organs are referred to as metastatic (Stage IV) disease (Goldhirsch 
A 2004). 
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains an incurable disease with a median survival of about 2 years; 
treatment is therefore essentially palliative (Bernard-Marty, Cardoso et al. 2004; Goldhirsch A 2004). 
The types of treatment used in MBC can be categorised as endocrine, chemotherapy and biological 
therapy. Generally, initial treatment in patients with nonaggressive, hormone-sensitive tumours is with 
endocrine therapy. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are the most widely used endocrine therapy. In 
patients with hormone-insensitive or aggressive tumours, chemotherapy is the usual initial treatment 
(Bernard-Marty, Cardoso et al. 2004; Goldhirsch A 2004). Anthracycline-containing regimes include 
5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) and 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and 
cyclophosphamide (FEC), and the most common non-anthracycline containing regimen is 
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5- fluorouracil (CMF). With the growing use of anthracycline-
containing therapy as adjuvant therapy, the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) have become 
established as the standard of care in patients with anthracyclines-resistant MBC (Bernard-Marty, 
Cardoso et al. 2004; Goldhirsch A 2004; Gralow 2005). Taxanes are also used in patients with MBC 
with no or minimal prior anthracycline exposure. Following failure of anthracyclines and taxanes, 
various agents are available, including capecitabine and vinorelbine. As biological therapy he 
monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin) is available for the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing 
breast cancer. 
The antineoplastic mechanism of action of paclitaxel as an antimicrotubule agent is well characterized 
(Schiff, Fant et al. 1979; Schiff and Horwitz 1980). Paclitaxel in a solvent-based cremophor EL 
formulation has been authorized and marketed in Europe since 1993 (Taxol). As a single agent, 
solvent-based paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the breast in patients 
who have failed, or are not candidates for standard, anthracycline containing therapy. In combination 
solvent-based paclitaxel is indicated for the initial treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer either with an anthracycline in patients for whom anthracycline therapy is suitable, or with 
trastuzumab, in patients who over-express HER-2 at a 3+ level as determined by 
immunohistochemistry and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. 
About the product: 
Abraxane is a cremophor-free colloidal suspension of paclitaxel and human serum albumin. Abraxane 
is a new formulation developed to overcome the water insolubility of the active component paclitaxel 
and prevent hypersensitivity reactions associated with solvent-containing formulations. Abraxane is 
presented lyophilized and contains 800 mg albumin per 100 mg paclitaxel prior to reconstitution with 
0.9% saline. The size of the paclitaxel nanoparticles is approx.130 nm. 
The applicant has submitted an application for a full marketing authorization under Article 8(3) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended). The claimed indications and posologies were metastatic breast 
carcinoma (260 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks) and adjuvant 
treatment of node-positive breast carcinoma following anthracycline and cyclophosphamide therapy 
(260 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 courses). Clinical data to 
5/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
support the application for the first line therapy MBC was insufficient and the indication has been 
restricted to treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the breast in patients who have failed, or are not 
candidates for standard, anthracycline containing therapy. The applicant did not submit any clinical 
trials to establish the efficacy in breast cancer in the adjuvant setting and this indication has been 
withdrawn. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Composition 
Abraxane is presented as a sterile lyophilisate for suspension for injection. Before use the product has 
to be reconstituted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution to obtain a suspension containing 5 mg 
paclitaxel per ml. Paclitaxel is present in the form of albumin-bound nanoparticles with a mean size of 
approximately 130 nm. 
Other ingredients include human albumin solution, water for injections and nitrogen. Only human 
albumin is left in the finished product.  
The product is packaged type I glass vials closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium 
crimp seal. A cardboard box is used to protect the product from light. 
Active Substance 
Paclitaxel is a known active substance described in the Ph. Eur. and the USP. The chemical name of 
paclitaxel is : 5β,20-epoxy-1,2α,4,7β,10β,13α-hexahydroxytax-11-en-9-one 4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate 
13-ester with (2R,3S)-N-benzoyl-3-phenylisoserine. It is a white or almost white crystalline powder, 
practically insoluble in water (less than 0.5 mg/ml), soluble in methanol and freely soluble in 
dichloromethane. Paclitaxel has 11 stereogenic centres and may exist in different crystalline forms. 
However only one crystal form of paclitaxel is found in the active substance used in the manufacture 
of the finished product 
The chemical structure of paclitaxel has been confirmed using analytical data by elemental analysis, 
IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR, UV and mass spectrometry. The solid state of paclitaxel has been characterized 
by means of thermal analysis (differential scanning calorimetry) and X-ray powder diffractometry.  
•  Manufacture 
Paclitaxel  is  manufactured  by  extraction  from  the  Taxus  x  media  roots  followed  by  successive 
liquid/liquid  extractions,  chromatographic  column  purifications,  crystallisation  purification  steps, 
granulation  and  drying.  Detailed  information  about  the  manufacturing,  validation  and  analytical 
controls of the active substance has been provided using the ASMF procedure. 
The starting material has been adequately characterized and complies with the Ph.Eur. monograph on 
Pesticides Residues. Appropriate specifications have been adopted for the starting material, solvents, 
processing aids and intermediates. All relevant impurities have been appropriately discussed. Forced 
degradation studies have shown the major degradation products. All impurities (including degradation 
products)  have  been  characterized.  The  levels  of  the  impurities  are  supported  by  the  results  of 
toxicological studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
•  Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (IR  and  HPLC), 
specific optical rotation, related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content, residue on ignition, 
heavy metals, residual solvents, microbial purity and endotoxins. 
Batch  analysis  data  from  13  production  scale  batches  and  several  supporting  batches  have  been 
provided. In all cases the product complied with the predefined specifications. 
•  Stability 
Stability studies have been performed in accordance with the ICH requirements. Samples from several 
production scale batches have been stored for 36 months at 25 ºC/60 % RH and for 6 months at 
40 ºC/75 % RH. The packaging materials used in the stability studies were the same as those intended 
for marketing.

The parameters tested were appearance, identification, specific optical rotation, water content, 
impurities and assay. The stability data provided justify the proposed retest period without special 
storage conditions. 
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
Paclitaxel is a highly lipophilic and essentially insoluble in water substance, but highly soluble 
in organic solvents. In other currently approved paclitaxel formulations, this problem is addressed by 
solubilizing paclitaxel in a mixture of organic solvents (e.g.ethanol) and surfactants (e.g. Cremophor®-
EL).  However, this approach  may  be  associated  with  a  number of side effects. The  objective  of the 
pharmaceutical  development  for  Abraxane  was  to  develop  a  surfactant-free  formulation  in  order  to 
avoid the appearance of possible side effects relating to the excipients used. 
In  Abraxane  the  solubility  problem  of  paclitaxel  is  solved  by  reducing  its  size  at  nano-scale 
level, thereby greatly increasing the surface area of the particles and improving dissolution.  
Human albumin functions as a surface-active polymer providing charge and steric stabilization 
to the paclitaxel nanoparticles to prevent aggregation. Stabilisation is achieved by the fact that albumin 
adsorbs  onto  the  surface  of  the  paclitaxel  nanoparticles,  thus  creating  a  sheet  that  functions  as  a 
surface-active  polymer  preventing  aggregation  of  paclitaxel  particles.  The  interaction  between 
paclitaxel  and  human  albumin  is  weak  and  both  substances  freely  dissociate  after  reconstitution. 
Human albumin was chosen since it is a biocompatible excipient and is not associated with toxicity, 
dosing,  or  infusion  set  incompatibility  problems.  Full  quality  documentation  on  the  human  albumin 
solution has been provided by the applicant. Information regarding the human plasma starting material 
is found in the plasma master file (PMF) certificate of the albumin manufacturer, provided in support 
of  this  application.  The  manufacturer’s  PMF  has  been  issued  by  the  EMEA  and  is  certified  to  be 
compliant with EU Community legislation. The human plasma used in the manufacture of the human 
albumin  is  collected  in  the  U.S.A.  and  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  requirements  and  the  US  Code  of 
Federal Regulations for source plasma. An agreement is in place between the albumin manufacturer 
and the applicant in order to maintain the link between Abraxane and post-collection information on 
the albumin and its starting materials. 
The rest of the excipients/processing aids used were chosen for their ability to produce a stable 
nanoparticle  suspension  of  paclitaxel.  Several  formulation  parameters  were  tested  to  optimize  the 
particle size and the stability of the final formulated suspension.  
The differences between the initial clinical trial formulation and the final commercial product 
have been shown not to result in relevant differences in key quality parameters, such as pH, particle 
size distribution, osmolality and viscosity.  
The packaging materials are commonly used in such formulations, while the compatibility with 
the  reconstituted  suspension  as  well  as  container-closure  integrity  was  demonstrated  in  stability 
studies. 
For the process development an aseptic filtration process has been chosen, since human albumin 
denaturates with heat and thus does not allow terminal sterilisation.. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process is a standard process for these kinds of formulations and consists of the 
following steps: mixing of oil and water phases, homogenization, evaporation, sterilization by 
filtration, aseptic filling, in vials, and lyophilisation. 
All critical process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls. 
The validation report from three production scale batches demonstrates that the process is reproducible 
and provides a finished product that complies with the in-process and finished product specifications. 
•  Product Specification 
The specification for the finished product at release and shelf life includes tests for appearance, 
identification (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), albumin content (HPLC), water 
content, uniformity of dosage units, reconstitution time, pH, particle size (mean and distribution), 
osmolality, particulate matter,  sterility and endotoxins. All tests included in the specification have 
been satisfactorily described and validated. 
7/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
Batch analysis data from 3 primary stability and 3 full scale batches have been presented. All batches 
met the test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of 
batch release. 
•  Stability of the Product 
Stability  studies  were  carried  out  according  to  the  ICH  requirements  on  three  batches  of  the  final 
commercial  formulation.  The  batches  were  produced  using  the  same  manufacturing  process, 
equipment and container as for the product intended for marketing. Samples were stored in inverted 
position at 25°C/60% RH for 24 months and at 40°C/75% RH for 6 months.  
The  parameters  tested  were:  appearance,  water  content,  paclitaxel  content,  human  albumin 
content,  impurities,  bacterial  endotoxins,  sterility,  reconstitution  time,  pH,  particle  size  distribution 
and particulate matter. The analytical methods were identical to the methods used for release and are 
stability indicating 
Additional  stability  studies  have  been  performed  to  demonstrate  the  stability  of  the  reconstituted 
product and the reconstituted suspension in intravenous infusion bags. A photostability study was also 
performed  in  order  to  investigate  the  protective  properties  of  the  secondary  packaging  against  the 
influence of light, as well as the photostability of the reconstituted product in infusion bags. 
In all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the 
commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Abraxane is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and 
pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major 
deviations from EU and ICH requirements. 
The active substance is well characterised and documented. It is a poorly soluble substance that has 
been  formulated  as  nanoparticles  in  order  to  overcome  the  solubility  issues  and  avoid  the  use  of 
surfactants and solvents and all the problems arising from their use. The nanoparticles are stabilised 
using human albumin a biocompatible excipient that has received PMF certification from the EMEA. 
The  other  excipients  are  commonly  used  in  these  types  of  formulations  and  comply  with  Ph.  Eur. 
requirements.  The  packaging  material  is  commonly  used  and  well  documented.  The  manufacturing 
process of the finished product is a standard process that has been adequately described. Stability tests 
indicate that the product under ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf 
life.  At  the  time  of  the  Opinion  some  minor  issues  remained  unresolved  and  it  was  agreed  to  be 
addressed as post approval obligations. These issues do not affect the benefit / risk of the product. 
2.3  Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Primary and secondary pharmacology studies were not conducted in accordance with GLP but were 
conducted using standard laboratory practices. The safety pharmacology studies were non-GLP. One 
pivotal single dose toxicology study and the reproductive toxicology studies were performed 
according to GLP. Repeated dose toxicity studies were not performed according to GLP. 
Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacology program is based on studies addressing the antineoplastic mechanism of 
action of paclitaxel and its delivery to the tumour when formulated as Abraxane.  
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
The mechanism for tissue distribution of paclitaxel delivered as Abraxane was analysed in several in 
vitro studies (see Table 1):

Study BIO-EL-1 shows that  Abraxane /Flutax (fluorescent-labelled paclitaxel) (20 µg/ml) exhibited 
2.3, 4.0, 9.9 and 2.9 fold higher binding to HSA, microtubules, human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVEC) and human M vascular endothelial cells (HMVEC), respectively, than solvent-based 
paclitaxel/Flutax (20 µg/ml). In addition CEL/ethanol (mixture of 527 mg CrEl and 392.3 mg ethanol) 
exhibited dose dependent inhibition of Flutax binding to HSA, microtubules, HUVEC and HMVEC. 
Complete inhibition was observed at a CEL/ethanol concentration of ≥0.01, ≥0.5, ≥0.5 and 0.007%, 
respectively. 
Study BIO-EL-2 showed that when paclitaxel and HSA are mixed they form a complex. The amount 
of Flutax that binds to HSA is 21% higher when Flutax is mixed with Abraxane than solvent-based 
paclitaxel, indicating that CrEL/ethanol is an inhibitor for binding of HSA to paclitaxel. 
Results from studies BIO-EL-3 and BIO-EL-4 showed that the intracellular accumulation of albumin 
was mediated by a non-lysosomal mechanism as there was no colocalization between albumin and 
lysosomes. The internalized albumin was localized to areas of high expression of SPARC (an albumin 
binding protein on the surface of cells), but not to areas with Caveolin-1 expression. In addition, 
SPARC was overexpressed on MX-1 breast carcinoma cells but not on normal cells including human 
mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), human microvascular epithelial cells-lung (HMVEC-L), and 
HUVEC. A second study, BIO-TF-1 showed that the albumin staining pattern matched that of 
SPARC, most prominently around necrosis areas. There was no correlation between albumin staining 
and caveolin staining. 
Results from study BIO-TF-2 showed that SPARC expression was absent in major organs of adult 
mice (liver, kidney, lung, brain, heart, stomach and spleen). Study BIO-TF-3 confirmed that SPARC 
expression was absent in colon, rectum, spleen, lung, prostate, heart, tonsil, lymph node, appendix, 
pancreas, eyeball, ovary and breast and found it present in the squamous epithelium of the oesophagus 
and spermatagonia and/or sertoli cells of the testis. In addition some of the examined samples of 
stomach (4/14), liver (3/20), kidney (2/20) and brain (1/14) showed positive staining. An additional 
study, BIO-TF-4, showed that SPARC expression was absent in the major organs from human 
foetuses (stomach, colon, rectum, liver, small intestine, spleen, lung, thymus, eyeball, heart, adrenal, 
kidney, muscle, gall bladder, thyroid, uterus, pancreas, brain and artery-VSMC) except for the 
squamous epithelium of the oesophagus, Leydig cells of the testis, osteoblast of bone, hofbauer cells 
of the placenta, vascular smooth muscle cells of the umbilical cord and artery, unidentified scatter 
cellular component of the bladder, fallopian tube and skin. 
In studies BIO-QY-1 and BIO-QY-2 the transport of paclitaxel across human umbilical vein 
endothelial cell (HUVEC) and human lung microvessel endothelial cell (HMVEC) monolayers was 
examined. The total paclitaxel transported across the HUVEC and HMVEC monolayer was 2.0-4.2 
folds higher for Abraxane than solvent-based paclitaxel. Removing the physiological 5% HSA 
concentration from the Abraxane mixture significantly reduced the level of paclitaxel trancytosis. Pre-
treatment with cyclodextrin (a gp60/caveolae inhibitor) decreased Abraxane paclitaxel transport down 
to the same level as solvent-based paclitaxel-Flutax (with or without pre-treatment with cyclodextrin) 
9/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or Flutax (with or without pre-treatment with cyclodextrin). Abraxane transport was also inhibited 
(two-fold) with NEM [N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-malemide], an alkylating reagent which inhibits 
caveolae fusion. Total paclitaxel transported was inhibited by 38% when the transport assay was 
performed in the presence of 100 µg/ml of rabbit polyclonal antibody against SPARC. 
Both Abraxane and solvent-based paclitaxel exhibited antiproliferative activity towards L1210 murine 
leukaemia cells (study PR-0001). The IC50 for Abraxane and solvent-based paclitaxel were 0.014 
µg/mL and 0.010 µg/mL, respectively. 
In vivo antitumour activity of iv administered Abraxane has been studied in athymic female nude mice 
transplanted with human tumour xenografts. Small differences in anti-tumour efficacy between 
paclitaxel formulated as Abraxane or as solvent-based paclitaxel. For HT29 (colon), PC-3 (prostrate), 
NCI-H522 (lung) and the multi/drug resistant MES-SA-Dx5 sarcoma xenografts solvent-based 
paclitaxel seems slightly more effective than Abraxane at equimolar dose. For SK-OV-3 (ovary) and 
MX-1 (mammary) Abraxane seemed somewhat more efficient at equimolar doses. 
Antitumour activity against MX-1 human mammary tumour in athymic nude mice was analysed in 
study SRI-LIF-97-171-9024.2. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 2.

Three studies on rabbits (one in vitro and two in vivo) and one in vivo study on swine were performed 
to study the effect of Abraxane preventing cell proliferation in other rapidly dividing cell populations 
using in-stent restenosis as a model. The submitted documentation shows that administration of a 
single dose of Abraxane with balloon-injured arteries resulted in a lack of endothelial healing and 
delayed replacement of intimal cells. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Studies on secondary pharmacodynamics have not been submitted. 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
The standard core battery of safety pharmacology tests has not been submitted. Three studies on 
myelosuppression have been provided (see immunotoxicity studies in the toxicology section). 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-clinical drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Abraxane. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel delivered as Abraxane  was studied in the Sprague Dawley rats, 
New Zealand White rabbits and athymic NCr-nu/nu mice. Absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
elimination characteristics were assessed following single iv injections, except for the absorption 
studies on rabbits which where done with intra-arterial injections. An overview of the pharmacokinetic 
programme is presented in Table 3.

Two types of analysis were employed for the determination of paclitaxel in the pharmacokinetic 
studies, liquid scintillation counting (LSC) of tritium (3H) labelled Abraxane or solvent-based 
paclitaxel and a validated liquid chromatography with atmospheric pressure ionisation tandem mass 
spectrometry detection (LC-API/MS/MS). LSC was calibrated to record counts above background 
noise. The lower limit of quantification for the LC/MS method is 5 ng/mL and the range of reliable 
responses is 5-1000 ng/mL. 
•  Absorption-Bioavailability 
Studies on absorption for Abraxane were not provided since it is developed for iv infusion. 
Conventional studies on pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters after iv administration have been examined 
in rats, and after intra-arterial injection in rabbits. 
Three studies in male rats were performed to compare PK parameters of 3H-paclitaxel formulated in 
Abraxane and solvent-based paclitaxel. Blood samples were collected from 2 minutes to 24 hours after 
dosing and counted for total radioactivity. Pharmacokinetic results obtained in blood are presented in 
Table 4.

Estimated AUC levels in rats increased linearly with dose, but in a more than dose-proportional 
manner. In humans, the AUC levels appeared to be linear with respect to Abraxane dose for the 
clinically relevant dose range (80 to 300 mg/m2). The T1/2 varied from 11.7 to 27.4 hours in the human 
clinical trials. Thus, PK parameters obtained in rats are comparable to the human situation. 
A PK study in NZW rabbits (3 males/group) was performed to investigate blood levels of Abraxane in 
a 2 day period after dosing. Stainless steel stents were deployed in both iliac arteries of two rabbits. 
Each animal received 3H-Abraxane by intra-arterial administration at doses of 5 or 25 mg/kg. After an 
initial rapid decline, 3H-Abraxane was slowly eliminated from the blood. Blood concentrations > 0.01 
μM were detected for 24-48 hours at an Abraxane dose of 5 mg/kg.

•  Distribution 
The distributions of 3H-Abraxane (21.7 mg/kg) to tumours following single iv injection were 
investigated in a 24-hour study on female mice (2-4 mice/time point/group) bearing subcutaneous, 
implanted MX-1 human mammary tumours (Study A590.1). Results are shown in Table 5:

The distribution of Abraxane was investigated also in healthy rats. Study P02020025 included 5 male 
and 5 female rats per group following a single iv injection of 3H-Abraxane (5 mg/kg) and compared to 
3H-solvent-based paclitaxel (5 mg/kg). For most tissues the exposure levels were slightly higher in 
animals treated with Abraxane than with solvent-based paclitaxel. In lungs, there was a 3.5-fold higher 
concentration of solvent-based paclitaxel compared to Abraxane. Males had slightly higher exposure 
of Abraxane in all measured tissues except for fat. For solvent-based paclitaxel the males had slightly 
higher exposure than females in tissues except for lung, stomach, small and large intestine, fat and 
aorta. Study P1096001 studied organ distribution in male rats given a single iv of 5.1 mg/kg Abraxane 
or 4.9 mg/kg solvent-based paclitaxel. 3H-Abraxane was present in greater quantities than 3H-solvent-
based paclitaxel in lung, kidney, pancreas and carcass, but not in brain, heart, liver, GI tract, testes, GI 
tract contents, spleen, prostate or seminal vesicles. However, the relative differences were minor. 
Binding of paclitaxel to plasma proteins is extensive (95%) and inversely related to the Cremophor EL 
level (Kumar, Walle et al. 1993; van Tellingen, Huizing et al. 1999; Brouwer, Verweij et al. 2000). 
Studies on placental transfer have not been submitted.  
•  Metabolism 
The applicant refers to literature for the description of the metabolism of Abraxane. The primary 
metabolites of paclitaxel are 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, 3'-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, and 6α, 3’-p-
dihydroxypaclitaxel (Sparreboom, Huizing et al. 1995).

One study was performed to assess the metabolism of  3H-Abraxane administered as a single iv dose 
to Sprague Dawley rats (5/sex/gr.) at a dose of 5 mg/kg (Study P0202002). HPLC analysis showed 
that, for males and females, 3H-Abraxane derived radioactivity was excreted in urine as paclitaxel 
metabolite and in faeces as paclitaxel. In comparison, faecal excretion of solvent-based paclitaxel in 
males was in the form of a metabolite, and in females 62% was excreted as paclitaxel and 38% as 
metabolites. 
•  Excretion 
The excretion of paclitaxel from Abraxane was evaluated in rats (5/sex/group) receiving 3H-Abraxane 
(Study P0202002). Results are shown in Table 7.

•  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Drug-interaction studies were not submitted. 
•  Other pharmacokinetic studies 
The pharmacokinetic differences between 3 batches of Abraxane produced from three different 
sources of paclitaxel have been studied (study P0303014). Whole blood paclitaxel levels for the three 
groups were comparable across the 0-72 hour time curve. There were no significant differences in any 
of the estimated pharmacokinetic parameters among the three lots tested (AUC, Cmax, Tmax and 
T1/2).   
In addition, the pharmacokinetic effect of the ratio of human albumin (HA) to paclitaxel in three 
formulations was tested. Three groups of 10 animals received a single iv injection of Abraxane at a 
dose of 50 mg/kg.  Blood samples were collected over 72 hours for pharmacokinetic analysis. The 
whole blood paclitaxel levels for the three groups were comparable across the 0-72 hour time curve.  
The AUC and Cmax values for the three formulations were similar.

•  Single dose toxicity 
A single intravenous dose study in male mice determined the LD50 values for Abraxane and solvent-
based paclitaxel to be 447 and 7.5 mg/kg respectively (study PR-0003) (follow-up 28 days). The LD50 
for the solvent-based paclitaxel vehicle without paclitaxel was 1325 mg/kg corresponding to a dose of 
15.2 mg/kg paclitaxel in solvent-based paclitaxel.  
In male rats a single dose (5 mg/kg), 14 days follow-up study (study PR-0002) investigated 
myelosuppression. White blood cell (WBC) counts were performed on Days 1, 3, 7, 10 and 14. 
Decreased WBC and body weight occurred in both treatment groups and in the solvent-based 
paclitaxel vehicle group (no effect on Abraxane vehicle). Recovery period from the nadir was shorter 
for Abraxane (7 vs. 14 days). Study PR-0007 analysed myelosuppression in male rats (3/group) after 
single doses of 0, 30, 90, 120 or 200 mg/kg, with a 14 days follow-up. There was a high level of 
chloroform (2962 ppm) in the formulated drug product. Decreased WBC and body weight was 
observed at 30 mg/kg dose. At 120 mg/kg dose 2 out of 3 mice died and the third presented diarrhoea, 
polyuria and kidney lesions. Above this dose all animals died. 
A single intravenous dose study (0, 5, 9, 30, 90 or 120 mg/kg of Abraxane and 5, 9, 30 mg/kg of 
solvent-based paclitaxel) was performed in rats (3 per sex per group) to determine general toxicity. 
Chloroform levels were 118 ppm in the Abraxane formulation (study P0397006). Abraxane was not 
lethal at 120 mg/kg, whereas all 12 rats receiving 30 mg/kg solvent-based paclitaxel died by Day 4. 
Only one rat receiving Abraxane (90 mg/kg) died on day 15. Piloerection and reduced body weight 
gain was seen animals at doses ≥ 90 of Abraxane. No significant changes in haematology occurred and 
alterations in electrolyte concentrations were small. The significant histopathology finding for 
Abraxane was the effect on male reproductive organs at doses of 30, 90 or 120 mg/kg. Acute lethality 
and central nervous system (CNS) effects associated with doses ≥9 mg/kg of solvent-based paclitaxel 
were not seen with Abraxane. 
Two single dose (175 mg/m2) dog studies with 14 day recovery (studies P0997006, vehicle controlled 
and P0897001, uncontrolled) were conducted to determine the toxicity of Abraxane. The study results 
were inconclusive because of clear evidence of an immune reaction in the dogs to human albumin. 
The symptoms observed in Abraxane treated dogs were also seen, but to a greater extent, in the control 
treated animals. Symptoms included depression characterised by quietness and slow responses to 
stimuli one to four hours after administration, and a syndrome characterised by gastrointestinal 
symptoms and oedema or vasculitis in the face and extremities of animals in all groups, typically 
appearing 3-6 days after dosing. In animals receiving the HSA control articles, symptoms were 
delayed until day 11. Histological changes in all groups were also observed and appeared consistent 
between the three groups, with the exception of testicular changes (seminiferous tubule degeneration) 
which were only seen in Abraxane-treated animals.

EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Lychron-001 examined the effects of Abraxane (doses 0, 1, 3, 6 mg/kg) in castrated male pigs 
(3 per group). Pigs were observed for 14 days, with blood sampling immediately after infusion and on 
days 5, 10 and 14, and necropsy on day 14. There was 1 death due to aspiration pneumonia at 6 
mg/kg. At this dose also diarrhoea, vomiting, depression, loss of appetite and neutrophilia were 
observed. Decreased BW, slightly elevated body temperature, decreased WBC, decreased neutrophils 
count and neutropenia were observed at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg. Neutropenia was also seen at 1 mg/kg. 
Gross necropsy revealed no obvious treatment-related changes, and histopathology did not show any 
cellular changes attributable to Abraxane.  
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
One repeat dose pilot study in immune-competent male mice and two dose-range finding studies in 
athymic female mice have been performed with Abraxane. Only preliminary studies of general 
toxicity were conducted. 
In study PR-004 CD1 mice (4 males per group) were administered daily iv infusions of Abraxane (30, 
69 or 103 mg/kg) or solvent-based paclitaxel (4, 6, 9, 13.4 or 20.1 mg/kg) for 5 days. The animals 
were observed for body weight and mortality for 28 days after treatment. In the Abraxane treated mice 
no deaths were recorded at 30 mg/kg, one animal died at 69 mg/kg and all animals died at 103 mg/kg. 
LD50 for Abraxane was calculated to 76.2 mg/kg. In the solvent-based paclitaxel treated mice no 
animals died at the lowest dose, one and two mice died at 6 and 9 mg/kg, respectively and all animals 
died at 13.4 mg/kg and 20.1 mg/kg. LD50 solvent-based paclitaxel was 8.1 mg/kg. 
Athymic female NCr-nu mice (2 per group) were administered iv infusions of either Abraxane at 
doses of 13.4, 20, or 30 mg/kg paclitaxel per day for 5 days or Abraxane vehicle (Study VIV-4). 
Solvent-based paclitaxel at the same paclitaxel doses was also included as a control. No signs of 
toxicity were observed in the three groups, although weight loss was observed in the highest dose of 
Abraxane (30 mg/kg/day) and solvent-based paclitaxel (30 mg/kg/day) treated animals. The 5-day 
repeated dose LD50 for all formulations was greater than 30 mg/kg/day. 
In study VIV-6 groups of 2 athymic female NCr-nu mice received iv injections of Abraxane, solvent-
based paclitaxel, bulk paclitaxel (45, 67, or 100 mg paclitaxel/kg/day) or Abraxane vehicle (600, 893 
or 1333 mg/kg/day HSA) for 5 consecutive days. Animals were observed for frank signs of toxicity 
over a 19-day period. The LD10 for Abraxane formulation and for solvent-based paclitaxel was less 
than 45 mg/kg/day, with all animals dying in each dose group. The LD10 for Abraxane formulation 
and bulk paclitaxel were 58 mg/kg/day. All animals died in the high dose group (100 mg/kg/day).  No 
deaths were recorded in mice treated with HSA. No signs of frank toxicity are described.  
•  Genotoxicity 
Studies assessing the genotoxic potential of Abraxane have not been submitted.  
•  Carcinogenicity 
Studies assessing carcinogenicity of Abraxane have not been submitted.  
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
A  reproduction  toxicity  study  was  performed    in  male  rats  receiving  twelve  weekly  iv  doses  of 
Abraxane  (0.5,  2,  7,  16  or  32  mg/kg/week)  (Study  4701-002).  Dose-dependent  adverse  effects  on 
mating performance and male fertility were observed. The NOAEL was 0.5 mg/kg/week. The adverse 
effects  on  fertility  were  only  partly  reversible  during  recovery.  There  was  no  evidence  of  foetal 
alterations, but there were indications of pre- and/or post-implantation loss. 
In study 4701-001 pregnant rats were administered daily iv injections of Abraxane (0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 8 
mg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity occurred at a NOAEL of 0.5 mg/kg/day, which is below the proposed 
clinical dose for Abraxane. Developmental toxicity was evident at 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg/week, with a 
significant reductions in foetal body weight, and no live foetuses at 4 and 8 mg/kg. Post implantation 
15/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
loss (embryo-foetal mortality) was evident from 1 mg/kg, including significant increases in the 
number of dams with any resorption, early and late resorption (combined and separate values) and the 
percentage of dams with all foetuses dead or that underwent resorption. 
Studies on prenatal or postnatal development, including maternal function were not performed. 
Studies on juvenile animals were not performed.   
•  Toxicokinetic data 
No studies were submitted. 
•  Local tolerance  
A local irritation study was performed female New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits (4 per group) 
demonstrating acceptable local irritation profile for Abraxane using para-venous, intravenous, intra-
arterial, and subcutaneous administration. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Studies on antigenicity were not submitted. 
Immunotoxicity 
In study MS-AB-1 male SD rats (6-8 males per group) were administered single iv injections of 
Abraxane (paclitaxel, 10, 15, 50 mg/kg), solvent-based paclitaxel (paclitaxel, 10 mg/kg), Taxotere 
(docetaxel, 10 mg/kg), solvent-based paclitaxel vehicle (Cremophor EL/Ethanol, volume matched) or 
Taxotere vehicle (Polysorbate 80/Ethanol, volume matched). Blood samples were collected daily for 
12 days, and were analyzed for complete cell counts and differentials. Results show that 3/6, 7/12, and 
3/6 rats treated with Abraxane (50 mg/kg), solvent-based paclitaxel and Taxotere, respectively, died 
prematurely. Weight loss was observed in all groups except for solvent-based paclitaxel vehicle, and 
was more severe for solvent-based paclitaxel than for Abraxane doses at 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg. 
Reversible myelosuppression was observed in all treatment groups (except vehicle controls), and was 
more severe for Taxotere than for Abraxane (all doses). All groups dosed with docetaxel or paclitaxel 
developed neutropenia, lymphopenia and monocyte suppression, followed by recovery, and the 
suppressions were significantly more severe for Taxotere (10 mg/kg) than for Abraxane at 10 and 15 
mg/kg and solvent-based paclitaxel (10 mg/kg). 
Study PR-0002 analysed male SD rats (4 males per group) administered single iv injections of 
Abraxane (5 mg/kg paclitaxel), solvent-based paclitaxel (5 mg/kg paclitaxel), Abraxane vehicle 
(albumin, equivalent to 5mg/kg paclitaxel) or solvent-based paclitaxel vehicle (Cremophor 
EL/Ethanol, equivalent to 5mg/kg paclitaxel). In this study Abraxane produced statistically significant 
less myelosuppression in rats than solvent-based paclitaxel (white blood cell nadir 24% and 55% of 
baseline respectively). The recovery periods from the white blood cell suppression were about 7 days 
and 14 days for the Abraxane and the solvent-based paclitaxel treated animals, respectively. Body 
weight changes were less pronounced following Abraxane treatment than with solvent-based 
paclitaxel or solvent-based paclitaxel vehicle. The vehicle for solvent-based paclitaxel produced 
neutropenia, which was similar in extent (white blood cell nadir approximately 61% of baseline) and 
recovery period to solvent-based paclitaxel-induced neutropenia, while Abraxane vehicle showed no 
significant myelosuppression. 
In study PR-0007 male SD rats (3 males per group) were administered single iv injections of 30, 90, 
120 and 200mg/kg paclitaxel as Abraxane. The batch of medicinal product used in this study had a 
chloroform level of 2962 μg/g (ppm). The animals were examined for 14 days after dosing, and blood 
samples were drawn at days 1, 3, 7, 10 and 14. All animals in the 200 mg/kg dose group died on the 
day of dosing and two of three animals in the 120 mg/kg group died by day 6. There was a dose-
related decrease in body weight and white blood cells. Nadir of white blood cells was around day 3-7, 
and recovery by day 14. The one remaining rat treated with 120 mg/kg over-expressed white blood 
cells by day 10, and the counts remained elevated in this animal at day 14. Only animals treated with 
30 mg/kg Abraxane returned to normal weight before end of the study. All animals treated with 90 or 
120 mg/kg of Abraxane showed diarrhoea and polyuria. Animals in the 90 mg/kg group appeared to 
16/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recover by day 9 post-treatment. Kidney lesions were observed at necropsy (day 14) for 1 animal 
dosed at 120 mg/kg and 1 animal dosed at 90 mg/kg. 
Dose-related adverse effects on spleen (a cyst or enlargement), thymus (atrophy or enlargement) and 
lymph nodes (reddening) were seen in groups dosed with 7, 16 and 32 mg/kg/week Abraxane in the 
fertility and early embryonic development study in male rats (4701-002). 
Metabolites 
Studies on metabolites were not submitted. 
Studies on impurities 
Study P0603001 was performed to compare the toxicity of Abraxane with typical (0.09%) and with 
elevated levels (1.9%) of the primary paclitaxel decomposition product 7-epipaclitaxel.  
Doses of 50 mg/kg were administered to groups of 4 male and four female rats. Animals were 
observed for general signs of toxicity, and sacrificed for necropsy on days 8 and 29. Saline was 
administered to control animals. There were no deaths or overt manifestations of toxicity. At necropsy, 
and common with results seen in previous studies, all male animals exhibited decreased testis size and 
discoloration with necrosis of the germinal epithelium. 
In Study P0904003, 12 male and 12 female rats received an intravenous injection of saline or 
Abraxane containing low or elevated levels of 7-epipaclitaxel. No definitive differences were seen 
toxicologically in haematology and serum chemistry mean results between Abraxane and Abraxane 
with elevated 7-epipaclitaxel levels up to 7 days following intravenous administration at 50 mg/kg in 
rats. It is concluded that an upper limit of NMT 1.0% for 7-epipaclitaxel in the drug product will not 
increase the toxicity of ABI 007. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A  revised  Environmental  Assessment  Report  (EAR)  is  provided  based  on  the  drug  paclitaxel.  The 
PECSURFACEWATER  value  for  paclitaxel  in  ABRAXANE  is  0.0001  µg/l,  based  on  peak  (maximum) 
projected consumption at Year 2017 (projected figures provided from Year 2008 to 2017). This value 
is  significantly  below  (100  times)  the  0.01  µg/l  Phase  I  action  limit,  as  stipulated  in  the  Guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.It is concluded that Abraxane offers a negligible risk to the environment 
following its prescribed usage in metastatic breast cancer patients and from its storage and disposal. 
The applicant has provided ISM Health data to address the potential emission to the environment after 
use of Abraxane. Abraxane was estimated to take a 35% share in the estimated use of taxanes to treat 
the indicated health condition. Under this assumption the PEC is 0.1 ng/L. Even for a 100% share in 
the group of patients treated with taxanes, the PEC would not be surpassed. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The majority of the studies have been performed with rodents (mice and rats), while the use of non-
rodents (dogs and swine) was limited because of immune responses against HSA. All studies were 
performed with the iv route of administration. 
The standard core battery of safety pharmacology tests has not been performed. This is considered 
acceptable, since paclitaxel is a well-known substance with well-defined safety and efficacy. In 
addition, differences in pharmacokinetics between Abraxane and solvent-based paclitaxel appear 
relatively small (max 2-fold difference). The two most significant dose limiting toxicities of taxanes, 
including paclitaxel, are myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy. Studies on myelosuppression 
have been provided, demonstrating a reversible, dose related myelosuppression. Studies on peripheral 
neuropathy have not been provided. Closely assessed during the clinical development, peripheral 
sensory neuropathy was apparent in the pivotal clinical studies and more frequent with Abraxane than 
with solvent-based paclitaxel, leading to a warning included in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
The measured radioactivity in plasma was significantly higher for solvent-based paclitaxel than for 
Abraxane the first 3 hours, indicating a faster distribution of paclitaxel delivered as Abraxane than of 
solvent-based paclitaxel. Levels of radioactivity in most of the evaluated tissues were not higher for 
17/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abraxane than for solvent-based paclitaxel. In tumours however, the levels of radioactivity were 
higher for Abraxane than for solvent-based paclitaxel at some time points, and it is important that the 
retention time of radioactivity in tumour was longer than in the other tissues. Interestingly, the in vitro 
studies supports albumin-dependent cellular uptake and transport of Abraxane across endothelial cells 
by a mechanism involving binding to the gp60 receptor and formation of vesicles within the caveolae 
and suggests a possible accumulation of Abraxane in tumour cells. The in vivo studies in different 
tumour models show that at maximum tolerated doses (solvent-based paclitaxel is more toxic than 
Abraxane) the anti tumour effect of Abraxane is equal to or better than the effect of solvent-based 
paclitaxel. 
No studies on genotoxicity or carcinogenicity were performed with Abraxane. The genotoxic 
properties of paclitaxel have already been evaluated for solvent-based paclitaxel, and no further 
studies are considered necessary for Abraxane. Paclitaxel was not mutagenic in standard Ames tests 
(Ma 1996), or in Drosophila wing Somatic Mutation Assay (Cunha, Reguly et al. 2001). On the other 
hand, paclitaxel can cause increased micronuclei formation in mouse bone marrow (Tinwell and 
Ashby 1994), and chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes (Digue, Orsiere et al. 1999). The 
overall conclusion from a number of genotoxicity studies with paclitaxel is that it affects the 
chromosomal spindle via microtubule disorganization but does not react directly with DNA. The 
consequence of this is apoptosis or necrosis (Wang, Wang et al. 2000). A warning has been include in 
section 5.3 of the SPC. 
Abraxane causes embryo/foetal mortality, malformations, reduced foetal weights and delayed 
ossification at exposure levels. These findings are reflected in section 5.3 of the SPC and Abraxane 
should not be used during pregnancy as stated in section 4.6 of the SPC. It is not known if paclitaxel is 
excreted in human milk. Because of potential serious adverse events in breast-feeding infants, 
Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation (in section 4.3 of the SPC). 
In male fertility studies, paclitaxel-related toxicity was seen in male rats. Potential effects on male 
fertility have been reflected in the SPC section 4.6, with reference to animal findings (section 5.3).    
2.4  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The clinical development program for Abraxane in breast cancer as a single-agent treatment for the 
treatment of metastatic breast cancer consisted in one pivotal Phase III study (CA012-0) and two 
supportive Phase II studies (CA002-0LD and CA002-0). Five additional Phase I and II clinical trials in 
patients with MBC were included in the safety analysis (Studies CA013-0, CA016, CA024, CA025 
and CA201). Two studies, DM97-123 and CA101, have been conducted to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose of Abraxane administered. Phase I and II studies in patients with advanced solid 
tumours (DM97-123, CA005-0, CA008-0, CA019, CA201, CA037) were submitted to support the 
pharmacokinetic program. No studies were submitted in the adjuvant setting. 
Scientific Advice was issued by the CHMP on 23 January 2003 and clarified on 14 April 2003.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Four studies are submitted, with pharmacokinetic data from a total of 65 subjects (both males and 
females, 85-100 % Caucasian) receiving doses of Abraxane from 80 to 375 mg/m2 (Table 9). In 
addition, published data regarding paclitaxel and solvent-based formulations for in vitro metabolism, 
plasma protein binding, hepatic metabolism and drug-drug interactions are provided.

A sensitive high performance liquid chromatographic method with atmospheric pressure ionisation 
tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-API/MS/MS) was developed and validated for determination 
of paclitaxel in human plasma. This method was also validated for different biological material such 
as human whole blood, urine and faeces.  The LC-API/MS/MS method involved a solid phase 
extraction of the analyte(s) and the internal standard from the biological material, followed by a 
reverse phase liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection, by positive ionisation. 
A penta-deuterated derivative (d5) of paclitaxel was used as internal standard.  
Most studies used non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analyses. PK analysis of the paclitaxel blood 
or plasma concentration-time data was conducted using the non-compartmental Model 202 (constant 
infusion) of WinNonlin, Version 4.1. Actual sample collection times were used in the paclitaxel PK 
analysis. PK analysis of 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3'-p-hydroxypaclitaxel blood concentration-time 
data was conducted using the non-compartmental Model 200 (extravascular input) of WinNonlin. 
Descriptive statistics were provided. In post hoc analysis studying age effect, the general linear 
modelling (GLM) procedure in SAS version 8.1 was used to perform the analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) using the log of AUCinfd and log of clearance. Significance level or alpha was set at 0.05. 
The mean paclitaxel pharmacokinetic parameters from studies with Abraxane doses relevant for the 
applied posology are given in Table 10.

Bioequivalence was tested for clinical batches with different ratios of human albumin to paclitaxel. 
One final modification was made for commercial manufacturing process: the pH adjustment of the 
human albumin solution (20%) and final formulated suspension was omitted (product code 103450). 
This last modification did not change the product characteristics as determined by particle size 
distribution, release testing and stability. The use of different albumin: paclitaxel ratios within Study 
CA005-0 did not affect the dose-normalised AUCinf. Furthermore, a comparison of the AUCinf vs. dose 
across all studies and all clinically relevant doses shows that the change in the albumin: paclitaxel 
ratio does not affect the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel.  
Study CA008-0 investigated Abraxane and solvent-based formulations of paclitaxel, 260 mg/m2 q3w 
and 175 mg/m2 q3w, respectively. Abraxane was administered IV over a period of 30 min, while 
solvent-based paclitaxel was administered over 3 hr. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters are given in 
Table 11. Whole blood concentration versus time curves for Abraxane and solvent-based paclitaxel 
(data not shown) indicate that the initial decrease in concentration (15 minutes after infusion) appears 
to be more rapid for Abraxane than for solvent-based paclitaxel, reflecting the increased CL and Vz 
for Abraxane. At the terminal elimination phase, the declines in paclitaxel concentration for the two 
preparations appear to be parallel. 
Table 11: Mean pharmacokinetic parameters from study CA008-0. 
•  Distribution 
No tissue distribution studies of paclitaxel after Abraxane administration have been performed in 
humans. 
Protein binding studies have not been performed for Abraxane. From published data from as solvent-
based paclitaxel (Kumar, Walle et al. 1993; Brouwer, Verweij et al. 2000), it is estimated that the 
protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane administration is about 90% (value in the absence of 
Cremophor). Solvent-based paclitaxel was bound about 95%. Human serum albumin and α1-acid 
glycoprotein were found to contribute equally to the binding, with a minor contribution from 
lipoproteins (Kumar, Walle et al. 1993). 
•  Elimination 
Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics in blood displayed a biphasic (study DM97-123) or multiphase (studies 
CA005-0, CA008-0, CA012-0) disposition profile. The elimination is mainly non-renal, and mainly as 
metabolites. Mean total body clearance was 15-21 l/hr/m2. Urinary and faecal excretion of paclitaxel 
and two metabolites (6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel) are shown in Table 12.

Using human hepatocytes, (Nallani, Goodwin et al. 2004) examined the effects of paclitaxel on the 
activity and expression of hepatic CYP3A4. Paclitaxel at clinically relevant concentrations potently 
induced CYP3A4 activity and expression in hepatocytes treated for 48-96 h. The effect of paclitaxel 
on CYP2C8 activity or expression has not been studied. 
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma/ blood data of paclitaxel administered as 
Abraxane for the different doses are given in Table 14 (Study DM97-123). The correlation between 
mean AUCinf and dose level appears to be linear across the three lower dose levels, and nonlinearity 
becomes evident at 375 mg/m2. Clearance and half-life were relatively similar across different dose 
levels. Linear regression analysis of AUCinf versus dose showed a linear relationship between AUCinf 
and dose, although the correlation was not strong (R2=0.5352).

•  Special populations 
Excretion in the urine has been shown to be minimal and specific studies in renal impaired patients 
were not performed. In one study with solvent-based paclitaxel (Gelderblom, Verweij et al. 2001), a 
high and reproducible AUC and longer T1/2 was observed in a female patient with severe renal 
impairment, compared to patients with normal renal function. The observed increase in systemic 
exposure in this patient was attributed to decreased renal metabolism and/or urinary excretion of 
unchanged drug or polar metabolites.

Data from studies DM97-123, CA005-0, CA012-0 and CA008 were combined in a post-hoc analysis 
to determine whether age had any influence on the PK of paclitaxel following Abraxane 
administration (see Table 15). The subjects’ ages in the studies ranged from 33 to 85 years of age. The 
mean AUC∞d and the mean CL of the ≥ 65 year-old age group was not statistically different from the 
< 65 year-old age group in these studies.  AUC∞d and CL were thus independent of age as categorised 
in this analysis.

The effects of gender, race, or body weight on the pharmacokinetics of Abraxane have not been 
studied. PK studies in children have not been performed. Specific warnings have been included in 
section 4.2 of the SPC including a special warning on section 4.4 for hepatic impaired patients.  
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

•  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which may have substantially 
different pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel.  
In vitro studies addressing the metabolism of Abraxane have been not been submitted. The applicant 
refers to published studies. No metabolism was detected with kidney microsomes (Cresteil, Monsarrat 
et al. 1994), but with liver microsomes two metabolites were found, 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’-p-
hydroxypaclitaxel (Cresteil, Monsarrat et al. 1994; Harris, Katki et al. 1994; Jamis-Dow, Klecker et al. 
1995). These were also shown to be the major metabolites recovered in patients (Monsarrat, Alvinerie 
et al. 1993; Harris, Rahman et al. 1994). A third metabolite, 6α, 3’-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel was also 
described to be the second most important metabolite in feces (Sparreboom, Huizing et al. 1995). The 
enzymes responsible for the metabolism of paclitaxel to these metabolites in human have been 
identified as the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (Rahman, Korzekwa et al. 1994; 
Bun, Ciccolini et al. 2003). Both 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel was reported to be 
less active the paclitaxel (Sparreboom, Huizing et al. 1995). 
Abraxane has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Only isolated studies are 
published on paclitaxel PK after solvent-based paclitaxel administration in patients with hepatic 
impairment. Some of these are summarized by (Panday, Huizing et al. 1997), and it was shown that 
hepatic impairment has a great influence on the systemic exposure of paclitaxel and metabolites. 
Decreased paclitaxel clearance in patients with impaired hepatic function (liver metastases, hepatitis 
viral C infection and chronic active hepatitis) was noted with an increased incidence of 
myelosuppression and mucocytosis.

PK/PD differences between Abraxane and solvent-based paclitaxel could be explained by the presence 
of Cremophor in the solvent-based paclitaxel formulation and by the increased dose of paclitaxel in 
the Abraxane treatment regimen. Paclitaxel may be retained in Cremophor micelles in the serum 
resulting in a slower tissue distribution and a higher AUC. On the other hand Abraxane shows a faster 
tissue distribution that may explain the lower neutropenia and myelosuppression observed. In the same 
way, peripheral neuropathy was related to cumulative paclitaxel dose and because of the higher dose 
of paclitaxel was given for Abraxane compared to solvent-based paclitaxel an increase in peripheral 
neuropathy was observed (see Clinical Safety). The resolution of peripheral neuropathy observed with 
Abraxane remains to be further investigated. The applicant has committed to provide additional safety 
data on the topic from ongoing studies and PSURs.   
No specific study has been submitted to explore the effect of renal or liver function on Abraxane 
pharmacokinetics. As renal clearance was estimated to be only about 4% of the total clearance, the 
effect of impaired renal function should be minimal. A specific study on the effect of liver impairment 
on Abraxane pharmacokinetics will be performed as a follow-up measure to explore the need for dose 
adjustment in patients with impaired liver function.  
Possible interactions of paclitaxel with other products have not been formally investigated by the 
applicant. However, considerable information is available in the scientific literature and was reviewed. 
In vivo studies have demonstrated that metabolism of paclitaxel by CYP2C8 is the most important 
pathway in humans with a minor contribution of CYP3A4. Therefore, caution should be exercised 
when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit (e.g. erythromycin, 
fluoxetine, gemfibrozil) or induce (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, 
efavirenz, nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or 3A4. A warning with the full interaction data known for 
solvent-based paclitaxel has been included in section 4.5 of the SPC until this information is available 
for Abraxane. 
Clinical efficacy  
The clinical study programme for the assessment of efficacy of Abraxane given every three weeks in 
patients with MBC comprises a total of three studies, one pivotal Phase III study (Study CA0120-0) 
and two supportive Phase II studies (studies CA002-0 and CA002-0LD) (see Table 18).

•  Dose response studies 
Two studies, DM97-123 (USA) and CA101 (China), with a total of 41 subjects (54% Asian, 44%  
Caucasian, 2% Hispanic, 39% male, 61% female) have been conducted to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose of Abraxane administered using the proposed posology (q3w). 
In study DM97-123, a total of 19 subjects received in the first cycle 135 (4 subjects), 200 (3 subjects), 
300 (6 subjects), or 375 mg/m2 (6 subjects). Individual patients received from 1 to 13 cycles. The 
patient population was 95% Caucasian and 5% Hispanic, largely female patients (84% female; 16% 
male). Dose-limiting toxicities observed at 375 mg/m2 were keratitis, blurred vision, sensory 
neuropathy, stomatitis, and Grade 4 neutropenia. These events were generally Grade 2 or 3, were 
reported after Cycle 1 dosing and were generally transient. 
In study CA101, an open-label, single-centre, dose-escalation, Phase I trial, all 22 patients were Asian 
(Chinese), 59% male and 41% female. Abraxane was administered IV q3w, 135 (3 subjects), 175 (4 
subjects), 225 (3 subjects), 260 (3 subjects), 300 (6 subjects), and 350 mg/m2 (3 subjects). All of the 
24/45

patients except 1 in the 175 mg/m2 dose group received ≥ 2 treatment cycles. Dose-limiting toxicities 
at 350 mg/m2 were grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 double vision, which occurred in 1 patient each.   
In both studies, the MTD was defined as the study drug dose that elicited > Grade 2 non-
myelosuppressive toxicity or > Grade 3 myelotoxicity in at least 2 of 6 patients. A minimum of 6 
patients were to be treated at the MTD in each study. The MTD for both studies was 300 mg/m2 given 
IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. 
•  Main study 
Study CA012-0  
A controlled, randomised, multicentre, open-label, Phase III, non-inferiority study to evaluate the 
safety/tolerability and antitumour effect of intravenously (IV) administered Abraxane compared to that 
of solvent-based paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Criteria (CTC) Grade ≥ 1 
Treatments 
Patients received either Abraxane at 260 mg/m2 administered IV over 30 minutes repeated every 3 
weeks without steroid pre-medication and without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 
prophylaxis, or solvent-based paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 administered IV over 3 hours repeated every 3 
weeks with standard pre-medication as per the package insert for solvent-based paclitaxel authorized 
in the country in which the study was being conducted. Cross-over to Abraxane after progression for 
25/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients in the solvent-based paclitaxel arm was not offered as part of the protocol, nor were patients 
in the Abraxane arm offered additional Abraxane after progression. 
Study drug was administered at Weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, etc. Patients without progressive disease (PD) after 6 
cycles could continue their assigned treatment at the Investigator’s discretion, provided none of the 
following withdrawal criteria had been met: 
• PD after a minimum of 2 cycles of Abraxane or solvent-based paclitaxel, or after initial response 
followed by increasing tumour size 
• development of a toxicity which is unacceptable, in the opinion of the Investigator, as defined by the 
NCI CTC 
• if, following the second dose reduction of Abraxane to 180 mg/m2, there was a recurrence of Grade 4 
neutropenia or any other haematologic toxicity that was Grade 3 or 4, or any Grade 3 or 4 non-
myelosuppressive adverse event (AE) (excluding alopecia), unless at the discretion of the 
Investigator there was evidence of continuing benefit to the patient 
• initiation of further anticancer therapy  
Dose reductions were permitted for patients with either haematologic or non-haematologic toxicities. 
A maximum of 2 dose reductions were allowed from the initial 260 mg/m2 dose. The first dose 
reduction was by 40 mg/m2 o 220 mg/m2, and the second dose reduction was by 40 mg/m2 to 180 
mg/m2. If a Grade 3 or 4 AE (excluding alopecia) recurred after a dose reduction to 180 mg/m2, the 
patient was discontinued from the study unless the Investigator determined there was a continuing 
benefit to the patient. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives were: 
− to compare the anti-tumour activity of Abraxane with that of solvent-based paclitaxel in patients 
with MBC 
− to evaluate the safety/tolerability of Abraxane compared to that of solvent-based paclitaxel 
The secondary objectives were: 
− to evaluate time to disease progression (TTP) and survival 
− to evaluate changes from baseline in quality of life (QOL) 
− to determine the PK of Abraxane 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the percentage of patients who achieved confirmed 
complete or partial target lesion response as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumours (RECIST) guidelines. Tumours were assessed at Weeks 5, 9 and 15 and thereafter every six 
weeks. Confirmation of CR and PR required response duration ≥ 4 weeks. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints for this study included the following: 
• percentage of patients who achieved complete or partial overall response 
• time to disease progression (TTP) 
• patient survival 
• percentage of patients who achieved each target lesion response/overall response of complete 
response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) 
• time to first complete or partial target lesion response/overall response 
• duration of complete or partial target lesion response/overall response 
• number of cycles of therapy to maximum target lesion response/overall response 
• duration of CR, PR, or SD for target lesion response/overall response 
• QOL evaluated by changes from baseline in scores on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) (Zubrod) performance status scale, European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-C30, and weight 
Two primary datasets were used: a) the clinical investigators’ assessments of response (Investigator 
Response Assessment Dataset) and b) an independent, blinded assessment of response based on 
radiological assessments made by a central radiology facility that was not otherwise associated with 
26/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the study (IRL Response Assessment Dataset). A reconciliation algorithm was established to create a 
third, derived dataset (the Reconciled Response Assessment Dataset), which conservatively reconciled 
any differences between the other 2 datasets. 
Sample size 
The study was powered to provide at least 80% power with a 1-sided Type I error (α) of 0.025 (2-
sided α = 0.05) to assure that Abraxane was at least 75% as active as solvent-based paclitaxel, 
assuming a baseline response rate of 30% for solvent-based paclitaxel. Enrolment was planned for 
approximately 460 patients to provide approximately 210 evaluable patients per treatment arm.  
Randomisation 
Within each country, randomisation (1:1 to the treatment groups) was stratified based on prior 
anthracycline use (yes/no) using a block size of 2.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis incorporated a multiple nested test procedure which is a closed test 
procedure:   
Step 1: Non-inferiority test of Abraxane versus solvent-based paclitaxel for the ITT population  
            The lower bond of the 95% confidence interval for the difference is < 0.75. 
            The analysis was stratified for the 1st line therapy versus > 1 st line therapy   
Step 2:  Superiority of Abraxane compared to solvent-based paclitaxel, ITT population 
Step 3:  Superiority of Abraxane compared to solvent-based paclitaxel, in the 1st line patients.

Recruitment 
A total of 460 patients enrolled into the study and were randomized to treatment with ABI- 007 (233 
patients) or with solvent-based paclitaxel (227 patients). Patients were enrolled at 28 sites in 
Russia/Ukraine (353 patients; 77% of patients), 20 sites in the UK (67; 15%), and 22 sites in the 
US/Canada (40; 9%). 
The first patient was enrolled at the 01 November 2001 and the data cut-off was 07 April 2003 when 
the 460th patient had the Cycle 4/Week 9 response assessment.  
Conduct of the study 
The  protocol  for  this  study,  originally  dated  19  June  2001,  was  amended  3  times  after  the 
randomization  of  the first patient.  Amendments  1-2  were in effect  prior to the data  cut-off  date and 
Amendment  3  went  into  effect  after  the  data  cut-off  date.  The  first  amendment  allowed  continued 
treatment after 6 cycles at the Investigator’s discretion to be consistent with standard for breast cancer 
27/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patient  care  in  some  participating  countries.  Additionally,  patients  who  initiated  further  anticancer 
therapy were to be discontinued from the study. Several of the other amendments are made to improve 
clarity and consistency, and also to improve safety. 
In the Abraxane and solvent-based paclitaxel groups, 10 and 2 patients, respectively, had important 
predefined protocol deviations. Of these, 4 patients in the Abraxane group and 2 in the solvent-based 
paclitaxel group were randomized but did not meet the eligibility criteria and were discontinued from 
the study before receiving any study medications; these patients were not included in the ITT 
Population. Data for the remaining 9 patients with predefined protocol deviations were considered 
evaluable for all efficacy and safety analyses, except for the per-protocol analysis of the primary 
efficacy endpoint. 
Three patients in the Abraxane group received aromatase inhibitors (letrozole, exemestane, and 
anastrozole, respectively) between the first and last doses of study drug (overlapping the study 
regimen for 4 months, 1 week, and 2 weeks, respectively).  
Baseline data 
All patients were female, 97% were Caucasian, and 83% were postmenopausal. Mean (S.D.) age was 
53.2 (10.10) years (range: 26 to 83 years); 86% of patients were < 65 years of age. Mean (S.D.) height 
was 161.7 (6.06) cm (range: 145 to 182 cm), and mean (S.D.) baseline weight was 70.0 (13.26) kg 
(range: 40 to 125 kg). No important differences between the treatment groups were noted in 
demographic parameters. Baseline disease characteristics are provided in Tables 19, 20, and 21:

Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study entry; 79% had 
visceral metastases; and 76% had > 3 sites of metastases.  Fourteen percent of the patients had not 
received prior chemotherapy; 27% had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only, 40% in the 
metastatic setting only, and 19% in both metastatic and adjuvant settings.  Fifty-nine percent received 
study drug as second or greater than second-line therapy.  Seventy-seven percent of the patients had 
been previously exposed to anthracyclines. 
Numbers analysed 
Patient disposition was shown for the all randomized population (AR). Efficacy and safety analyses 
were performed for the ITT and safety populations, respectively; both of these populations were 
defined as randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The primary efficacy 
analysis was also performed for the Per Protocol (PP) and AR populations. The PP population 
excluded 25 patients from the ITT population: 9 patients (Abraxane: 8; solvent-based paclitaxel: 1) 
with protocol deviations and 16 (ABI- 007: 10; solvent-based paclitaxel: 6) who received only 1 dose 
of study drug. Thus the PP population consisted of 429 patients, 211 in the Abraxane group and 218 in 
the solvent-based paclitaxel group. Patient populations for analysis are summarized in Table 22.

SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
OVERALL RESPONSE RATE (ORR) 
The investigator’s overall response rate (invORR) for all patients was 33.2% in the Abraxane group 
and 18.7% in the solvent-based paclitaxel group (95% CI 27.09, 39.29 vs. 13.58, 23.76, p = 0.001). Of 
the 76 patients in the Abraxane group with confirmed overall responses, 74 achieved a PR and 2 
achieved a CR; of the 42 in the solvent-based paclitaxel group, 39 achieved a PR and 3 achieved a CR. 
An independent radiological laboratory (IRL) conducted blinded assessments of tumour images. The 
IRL evaluated only tumours that could be assessed radiological and therefore could not make 
30/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assessments on 25 patients, of which 15 had only clinically detected lesions and 10 had poor or no 
scans. These patients were therefore excluded from the IRL dataset, which consisted of 215 patients in 
the Abraxane group and 214 in the solvent-based paclitaxel group. Overall response rates using the 
IRL dataset (irlORR) were 21.4% in the Abraxane group and 10.3% solvent-based paclitaxel group (p 
= 0.002; ratio = 2.037 CI: 1.276-3.252). 
Statistical testing of treatment group differences in the response rates was performed. Testing was 
done using the CMH (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistical analysis) test stratified by 1st line vs. >1st 
line therapy or the chi-square test, as appropriate. The invORR analysis in patients receiving 1st-line 
therapy is shown in table 25. 
Table 25. invORR by Line of Therapy (ITT Population) 
Regarding prior anthracycline therapy, the invORRs were statistically significantly higher in the 
Abraxane group than the solvent-based paclitaxel group in patients with prior anthracycline therapy 
(adjuvant or metastatic) (34.1% vs. 18.3%, P = 0.002) and in patients with prior metastatic 
anthracycline therapy (27.0% vs. 13.8%, P = 0.010).  
TIME TO PROGRESSION (TTP) 
Time to disease progression, analyzed using the Investigator’s Response Assessment, was statistically 
significantly longer in the Abraxane group than in the solvent-based paclitaxel group (21.9 vs. 16.1 
weeks, P = 0.030). This result was confirmed by the analysis of TTP using the Reconciled Response 
Assessment Dataset (16.6 vs. 15.4 weeks, p = 0.016). 
Time to disease progression was analyzed by line of therapy using the Investigator Response 
Assessment. TTP was higher for the Abraxane group, both for patients receiving 1st-line therapy (28.4 
vs. 21.1 weeks, P = 0.056) and for patients receiving > 1st line therapy (19.4 vs. 16.1 weeks, P = 
0.199).  
SURVIVAL 
Median time to death was not statistically different for the Abraxane and solvent-based paclitaxel 
groups (65.0 vs. 55.3 weeks; HR = 0.899; p = 0.322), nor for first line patients, but it appeared 
significant for patients receiving second or greater line therapy (56.4 vs. 46.7 weeks, HR = 0.726, CI 
95% 45.1, 76.9 vs. 39.0, 55.3, p= 0.020). For patients who received study drug as first line treatment 
there was a trend toward shorter survival in the Abraxane arm compared to the solvent-based 
paclitaxel arm (71.0 vs. 77.9 weeks, HR=1.215, p=0.264). At the time of this analysis overall at least 
80% of patients had died or were lost to follow-up. See figure 26a and 26b:

PROGRESSION FREE SURVIVAL (PFS) 
Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) was significantly longer with Abraxane than with solvent-
based paclitaxel for all patients (22.7 vs. 16.6 weeks; HR = 0.734; P = 0.003, log-rank) (See Figure 
27). 
PFS appeared longer for patients who received first-line therapy (23.7 vs. 19.7 weeks; HR = 0.788; P 
= 0.173), although this difference was not statistically significant. PFS also was significantly longer 
with Abraxane than with solvent-based paclitaxel for patients who received study drug as second- or 
greater-line therapy (20.6 vs. 16.1 weeks; HR = 0.714; P = 0.010). 
Figure 27. Progression-Free Survival (ITT Population) 
QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT 
Using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, version 3, virtually no statistically significant differences 
between the treatment groups were noted in baseline values and mean change from baseline to each 
visit for scale scores. For patients with confirmed target lesion response, no statistically significant 
differences between the treatment groups were noted, with a noted exception of “Pain Symptom” at 
baseline (Abraxane: 3.8 [1.73] vs. solvent-based paclitaxel: 2.7 [0.98], P = 0.004). Absolute values for 
the total score and the scale “Global Health Status/QOL” did not show notable trends or statistically 
significant differences between the treatment groups.

Of the forty-three patients enrolled, 31 (72%) completed ≥ 6 cycles. Most of the patients discontinued 
due to disease progression (67%) and lost to follow up (25%). Confirmed target lesion response rates 
(TLRRs) were 39.5% (95% CI 24.9%, 54.2%) for all 43 patients (5% CRs, 35% PRs, 28% SD and 
26% PD), 42.9% for the 21 anthracycline-naïve patients, 36.4 % for the 22 patients previously treated 
with anthracyclines and 44.8% for the 29 first-line patients. Response was noted both for patients with 
visceral dominant site lesions (45.2%) and for patients with nonvisceral dominant site lesions (25.0%). 
CA002-0   
Of the sixty-three patients enrolled, 37 (59%) completed ≥ 6 cycles. Most of the patients discontinued 
due to disease progression (69%) and other Grade 3 or 4 toxicity (19%, neuropathy). Confirmed 
TLRRs were 47.6% (95% CI: 35.3%, 60.0%) for all 63 patients (3% CRs, 44% PRs, 17% SD and 30% 
PD), 57.7% for the 26 anthracycline-naïve patients, 40.5% for the 37 patients previously treated with

visceral dominant site lesions (39.5%) and for patients with nonvisceral dominant site lesions (68.4%). 
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Overall, the results suggest that Abraxane as >1st-line therapy has a statistically significantly better 
anti-tumour effect in patients with MBC than solvent-based paclitaxel. 
In patients who received Abraxane as first-line therapy, a difference was observed in the primary 
endpoint of response rate but not in terms of secondary endpoints such as TTP and PFS, and shorter 
survival was observed in the Abraxane arm compared to the solvent-based paclitaxel arm (71.0 vs. 
77.9 weeks, HR = 1.215, p = 0.264). The efficacy of Abraxane as 1st-line treatment of patients with 
MBC has not been demonstrated and this application was withdrawn after the D120 List of Questions.   
There are no clinical data available regarding the activity of Abraxane as adjuvant treatment of 
patients with breast cancer. This indication was withdrawn after the D120 List of Questions. 
Clinical safety 
The total number of patients exposed to Abraxane at any dose and any dose regime in any study 
sponsored by the applicant was 1,223. All patients were treated intravenously. About half of the 
exposed patients had MBC and 30 had early stage breast cancer. Most of the remaining patients 
exposed to Abraxane had other solid tumours, particularly non-small-cell lung cancer and melanoma, 
except for 106 patients with ischaemic heart disease who were treated with Abraxane following 
placement of a coronary stent. 
A total of 445 breast cancer patients treated with Abraxane were included in a primary integrated 
safety database. This database comprised of patients with MBC who were treated with Abraxane at 
doses ranging from 135 to 375 mg/m2 of 30 minutes infusion every 3 weeks. In the integrated safety 
database encompassed, besides CA012-0, studies DM97-123, CA008-0, CA CA018, CA101 as well as 
CA002-0LD and CA002-0.

The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was greater with Abraxane than solvent-based paclitaxel in 
Study CA012-0. No grade 4 sensory neuropathy was reported. Of the 24 patients that developed a 
grade 3 sensory neuropathy due to Abraxane, the median time to improvement (to grade 1 or 2) was 
22 days vs. 79 days for the 5 grade 3 patients on solvent-based paclitaxel (p = 0.028 log-rank test). 
Analysis of the effect of the cumulative paclitaxel dose on the severity of peripheral neuropathy in 
Study CA012-0 showed the expected relationship between cumulative dose and severity. 
•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The toxicity/AE most frequently reported as a serious adverse event (SAE) was neutropenia (see Table 
31); all SAEs of neutropenia were considered to be treatment-related. Otherwise, no other SAE 
showed a notable difference in incidence between the treatment groups.

In the pivotal study, 6 patients in the Abraxane group and 8 in the solvent-based paclitaxel group died 
while on study (see Table 32). In all cases, death was caused by progression of the patients’ breast 
cancer, although for some patients, the more immediate cause was listed (eg, multiorgan failure, brain 
metastases, brain edema). One death (due to multi-organ failure) in the solvent-based paclitaxel group 
was considered possibly related to study drug; all of the other deaths were considered not related to 
study drug.

•  Laboratory findings 
In the Phase III study, mean counts of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, and mean 
values for mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), showed no notable differences between the treatment 
groups. The only laboratory value that was notably different between the 2 arms was serum glucose, 
which was greater in the solvent-based paclitaxel arm. This finding was associated with a higher 
incidence of hyperglycaemia as an adverse event in the solvent-based paclitaxel arm (3 patients [1%] 
vs. 15 patients [7%], p = 0.003). In the phase I and II studies, there were no notable changes in these 
parameters. In the phase I and II studies, no notable trends were observed for changes from baseline in 
clinical chemistry parameters.

•  Safety in special populations 
In the pivotal study, toxicities/AEs were compared for patients who had normal liver function tests 
(bilirubin, AST, ALT) at baseline (Abraxane: 129; solvent-based paclitaxel: 113) with patients who 
had at least 1 parameter outside the normal range (Abraxane: 95; solvent-based paclitaxel: 108). 
Similar analyses were done for renal function; however, only 26 patients (Abraxane: 14; solvent-based 
paclitaxel: 12) had serum creatinine that was not in the normal range at baseline. There were no 
notable differences for either analysis. 
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Possible interactions of Abraxane with concomitantly administered medications have not been 
investigated.

•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The proportion of patients on Abraxane that discontinued prematurely from study CA012-0 due to 
treatment-related adverse events was greater than with solvent-based paclitaxel (7% vs. 4%, 
respectively, not statistically significant). Sensory neuropathy mostly accounted for this difference. In 
13 cases with sensory neuropathy related to Abraxane requiring dose reduction, 10 eventually became 
grade 3 events and three became grade 2 events.  
•  Post marketing experience 
Cranial nerve palsies, vocal cord paresis, and rare reports of severe hypersensitivity reactions have 
been reported during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane. In some patients previously exposed to 
capecitabine, reports of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported as part of the 
continuing surveillance of Abraxane. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during 
clinical practice, true estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship to the events 
has not been established. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the randomized Phase III clinical study CA012-0 the degree of neutropenia (all or only Grade 4) 
was greater with solvent-based paclitaxel than with Abraxane, even though the dose of paclitaxel was 
50% higher for Abraxane. The reduced myelosuppression for Abraxane is also consistent with the 
more rapid clearance of paclitaxel from the plasma for this formulation compared to solvent-based 
paclitaxel (Study CA008 and ((Sparreboom, Huizing et al. 1995)). The relationship between the PK 
variables of Abraxane and ANC Nadir values was evaluated using a regression model in which log-
transformed ANC Nadir values were used to account for the non-linear (e.g. sigmoid) relationship 
between absolute neutrophil count (ANC Nadir) and PK variable. There is a significant relationship 
between absolute ANC Nadir value and the PK parameters of AUCinf and the Duration of Time that 
paclitaxel concentration remain at or above threshold concentrations of either 84 ng/ml or 42 ng/ml (p-
values are <0.001, 0.031, and 0.017, respectively). 
There is also a significant relationship between Percentage Decrease in ANC Nadir from Baseline and 
the PK parameters of AUCinf and the Duration of Time that paclitaxel concentration remains at or 
above a threshold concentration of 42 ng/ml (p-values are 0.004 and 0.030, respectively). For solvent-
based paclitaxel, on the contrary, AUCs would not correlate with ANC nadirs, because it has a delayed 
tissue distribution due to retention in cremophor micelles and results in higher AUC values. However, 
since the effects of Cremophor on solvent-based paclitaxel PK are primarily in the ‘early’ distribution 
phase, as demonstrated by the similar terminal phases for Abraxane and solvent-based paclitaxel, the 
‘late measure’ of time above a drug level threshold applies for both drugs. 
In the literature, neutropenia has also been correlated with the duration of paclitaxel exposure in the 
blood (i.e. time above a threshold drug concentration) (Kearns, Gianni et al. 1995). The bone marrow 
progenitor cells express the MDR1 gene product (pgp). While Cremophor does not penetrate the 
tissues well enough to inhibit pgp expression in tumour cells, bone marrow exposure to Cremophor in 
combination with paclitaxel could enhance the marrow toxic effects of paclitaxel by increasing the 
haemotopoietic intracellular paclitaxel concentrations due to inhibition of the efflux (pgp) pump 
((Woodcock, Jefferson et al. 1990; Sparreboom, Verweij et al. 1998). 
A dose related increase in frequency of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy for Abraxanecompared to 
solvent-based paclitaxel was also observed study CA012-0. The PD relationship of dose to frequency 
and grade of peripheral neuropathy was evaluated in Phase III clinical Study CA012-0 and 
demonstrated that the cumulative paclitaxel dose predicted peripheral neuropathy as graded by the 
physician for both Abraxane and solvent-based paclitaxel. The curves for Abraxane and solvent-based 
paclitaxel were essentially identical except for the fact that patients receiving Abraxane had a higher 
cumulative paclitaxel exposure. These data are also consistent with the equal tissue distributions that 
were demonstrated in the animal models. In addition the Abraxane related neuropathy resolves more 
quickly than with solvent-based paclitaxel. Cremophor and ethanol, which are contained in solvent-
38/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
based paclitaxel but not in Abraxane, have been demonstrated in a rat model to produce axonal 
degeneration that can be histologically demonstrated in the absence of paclitaxel (Authier, Gillet et al. 
2001). In this model, a single injection of Cremophor induced a delayed peripheral neuropathy that 
persisted longer than that caused by repeated injections of paclitaxel only.

SPC section 4.4 contains the following with 
reference to myelosuppression: 
Hepatic Impairment:  
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at 
increased risk of toxicity, particularly from 
myelosuppression, and such patients should be 
closely monitored for development of 
profound myelosuppression.  
The SPC for Abraxane, Section 5.1 includes 
the statement below to advise that the 
relationship between cumulative dose of 
paclitaxel and cumulative neurotoxicity 
beyond 6 cycles has not been studies. 
‘229 patients treated with Abraxane in the 
randomized, controlled clinical trial were 
evaluated for safety.  Neurotoxictiy to 
paclitaxel was evaluated through improvement 
by one grade for patients experiencing grade 3 
peripheral neuropathy at any time during 
therapy.  The natural course of peripheral 
neuropathy due to cumulative toxicity of 
Abraxane through to resolution to baseline 
after > 6 courses of treatment was not 
evaluated and remains unknown.’ 
The frequency of peripheral neuropathy is 
provided in Section 4.8 of the package insert.  
Final study reports for CA0241, CA0302, and

Cardiotoxicity 
Routine Pharmacovigilance 
The frequency of cranial nerve palsies is 
labelled in section 4.8 of the SPC.. 
The SPC for Abraxane, Section  4.2 includes 
the following statement: 
‘Insufficient data are currently available to 
recommend dose modifications in patients 
with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.4. and 5.2). Patients with severe 
hepatic impairment should not be treated with 
paclitaxel.’ 
The frequency of injection site reactions is 
labelled in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Section 4.4 of the SPC contains the following 
statement regarding cardiotoxicity

Section 4.5 of the SPC includes the following 
information regarding drug interactions: 
Conduct a safety and 
pharmacokinetics study to evaluate 
the potential for drug interactions 
between Abraxane and anthracyclines 
The clinical study will be completed 
by March 2010 
‘No interaction studies have been performed.’ 
Sufficient information is available on the 
interactions with the solvent-based 
formulation of paclitaxel however to include 
the following precautionary statements in 
section 4.5. 
‘The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in 
part, by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (see section 5.2).  
Therefore, caution should be exercised when 
administering paclitaxel concomitantly with 
medicines known to inhibit (e.g. 
erythromycin, fluoxetine, imidazole 
antifungals) or induce (e.g. rifampicin, 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, 
nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.  
Abraxane is indicated for mono-therapy. 
Abraxane should not be used in combination 
with other anticancer agents. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are 
no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers 
and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. This stability results in the inhibition of 
the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and 
mitotic cellular functions.  In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of 
microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.  
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles. Albumin is known to mediate 
endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituents and in vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of 
albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells.  It is hypothesised that this enhanced 
transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor, and that there is accumulation of 
paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic 
rich in cysteine).

The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied. However, based on the published 
literature, paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses, based upon its 
pharmacodynamic mechanism of action. Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro 
(chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (micronucleus test in mice).  Paclitaxel 
has been shown to be genotoxic in vivo (micronucleus test in mice), but it did not induce mutagenicity 
in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary/hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 
(CHO/HGPRT) gene mutation assay. 
Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fertility and foetal 
toxicity in rats. Animal studies showed non-reversible, toxic effects on the male reproductive organs at 
clinically relevant exposure levels. 
Efficacy 
Data from 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study and from 106 patients 
accrued in two single-arm open-label studies are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic 
breast cancer. 
The pivotal trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated every 3 
weeks with single-agent paclitaxel, either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 given as a 3-hour 
infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity (N = 225), or as Abraxane 260 mg/m2 given as 
a 30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229). Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired 
performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study entry; 79% had visceral metastases; and 76% had > 3 sites 
of metastases.  Fourteen percent of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy; 27% had 
received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only, 40% in the metastatic setting only, and 19% in 
both metastatic and adjuvant settings.  Fifty-nine percent received study drug as second or greater than 
second-line therapy.  Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been previously exposed to 
anthracyclines. 
Results from the pivotal trial showed that the overall response rate was 33.2% in the Abraxane treated 
group versus 18.7% in the solvent-based paclitaxel group. The use of Abraxane resulted in a 
statistically significant prolongation of TTP and PFS in all patients and in patients receiving the study 
drug as >1st-line therapy. However, in patients receiving 1st-line therapy TTP and PFS were not 
statistically significantly different from the solvent-based paclitaxel group. There was a prolongation 
of survival of approximately 10 weeks in all patients and in patients who received study drug as > 1st-
line therapy in favour of the Abraxane arm. In contrast, for patients who received the study drug as 
1st-line therapy there was a trend toward shorter survival in the Abraxane arm compared to the 
solvent-based paclitaxel arm. 
In the single-arm open-label studies Abraxane was administered to metastatic breast cancer patients as 
a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/m2 to in the first study (43 patients) and at a dose of 
300 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion in the second study (63 patients). Patients were treated without 
steroid premedication or planned G-CSF support. Cycles were administered at 3 week intervals. The 
response rates were 39.5% and 47.6% for the two studies, respectively. The median time to disease 
progression was 5.3 months for the 175 mg/m2 dose study and 6.1 months in the 300 mg/m2 dose 
study. 
Studies in the adjuvant setting for the treatment of patients with node-positive breast carcinoma have 
not been submitted. 
Safety 
The most common adverse events related to 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were 
treated with 260 mg/m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal phase III clinical study were 
qualitatively not different from the known AEs related to currently registered paclitaxel formulations. 
Neutropenia was the most notable important haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients), and 
was rapidly reversible and dose dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients. Grade 4 
neutropenia (< 0.5 x 109/l) occurred in 9% of patients treated with Abraxane. Febrile neutropenia 
42/45 
EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
occurred in four patients on Abraxane.  Anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dl) was observed in 46% of patients on 
Abraxane, and was severe (Hb < 8 g/dl) in three cases. Lymphopenia was observed in 45% of the 
patients. In general, the frequency and severity of neurotoxicity was dose-dependent in patients 
receiving Abraxane. Peripheral neuropathy (mostly Grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy) was observed in 
68% of patients on Abraxane with 10% being Grade 3, and no cases of Grade 4. Nausea occurred in 
29% of the patients and diarrhoea in 25% of the patients. Alopecia was observed in 90% of the 
patients treated with Abraxane. Arthralgia occurred in 32% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 
6% of cases.  Myalgia occurred in 24% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 7% of cases.  The 
symptoms were usually transient, typically occurred three days after Abraxane administration and 
resolved within a week. General disorders and administration site disorders as asthenia and fatigue 
were reported in 40% of the patients.  
No studies on safety of Abraxane in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer have been submitted.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. 
•  User consultation 
The applicant performed a readability testing (“user consultation”) and a satisfactory report has been 
provided. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
The benefit/risk profile of Abraxane in the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the breast in patients 
who have failed, or are not candidates for standard, anthracycline containing therapy is considered 
positive. Abraxane does not require pre-medication and a higher tumour response rate was observed in 
a randomised Phase III study in comparison to solvent-based paclitaxel. In addition, secondary 
endpoints such TTP, PFS and OS appeared to be prolonged in patients receiving second- or further-
line therapy with Abraxane compared with patients treated with solvent-based paclitaxel. The safety 
profile was similar between ABI007 and solvent-based paclitaxel except for a higher incidence of 
sensory neuropathy associated with ABI007. 
In patients receiving 1st-line therapy there was a trend toward shorter survival in the Abraxane arm 
compared to the solvent-based paclitaxel arm. The 1st-line therapy indication has been withdrawn by 
the applicant. 
Studies in the adjuvant setting for the treatment of patients with breast carcinoma have not been 
submitted and the adjuvant indication has been withdrawn by the applicant. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed 
to investigate further some of the safety concerns.  
  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Abraxane monotherapy for the treatment of metastatic breast 
cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard, 
anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated, was favourable and therefore recommended the 
granting of the marketing authorisation.

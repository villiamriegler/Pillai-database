Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Valdoxan 
agomelatine 
On 19 September 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a 
positive opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the 
medicinal product Valdoxan. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Les 
Laboratoires Servier. They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they 
notify the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the 
opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new contraindication as follows: 
“Hepatic impairment (i.e. cirrhosis or active liver disease) or transaminases exceeding 3 X 
upper limit of normal” 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full contraindication(s) for Valdoxan will be as follows2: 
“Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hepatic impairment (i.e. cirrhosis or active liver disease) or transaminases exceeding 3 X upper 
limit of normal (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Concomitant use of potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) (see section 4.5).” 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be 
issued within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion.

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Insulin detemir (Levemir) received marketing authorisation from the European Commission on 1 June 
2004 and by the Food and Drug Agency (FDA) on 16 June 2005, and has since been marketed in more 
than 60 countries worldwide. It was originally approved for use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus as 
a  long-acting  basal  insulin  in  combination  with  meal-related  insulin  and  subsequently  also  in 
combination with oral antidiabetic drugs. Insulin detemir is to be administered s.c. once or twice daily, 
and the dose is to be adjusted individually, depending on the subjects’ needs. 
In the EU, the indication was subsequently extended to include paediatric subjects ≥ 6 years of age on 
29  March  2005  (Commission  Decision)  based  on  the  results  of  a  confirmatory  clinical  efficacy  and 
safety trial in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years (NN304-1379). 
In the US, Levemir was initially approved for once- or twice-daily subcutaneous administration for the 
treatment  of  adult  and  paediatric  patients  with  type  1  diabetes  mellitus  or  adult  patients  with  type  2 
diabetes mellitus who require basal (long acting) insulin for the control of hyperglycaemia. As with the 
EU label, the indication for paediatric subjects between ages 6-17 years was also based on clinical trial 
NN304-1379. 
The  paediatric  clinical  development  programme  for  the  use  of  insulin  detemir  consists  of  four  trials: 
One completed clinical pharmacology trial (NN304-1222), one completed phase 3a clinical efficacy and 
safety trial (NN304-1379), one completed phase 3b clinical efficacy and safety trial (NN304-1689) and 
a phase 3b clinical efficacy and safety trial (NN304-1690), which is an extension trial to Trial NN304-
1689. 
The  long-term  safety  trial  (NN304-1689)  was  performed  with  children  and  adolescents  with  type  1 
diabetes  to  investigate  the  long-term  safety  of  the  product  in  paediatric  subjects  including  the 
development of insulin antibodies in children during at least 52 weeks of treatment. Since the time for 
peaking of insulin antibodies in children was not known, an extension trial of a further 52 weeks (Trial 
NN304-1690)  was  performed.  Children  with  Type  1  diabetes  in  the  insulin  detemir  treatment  group 
were followed for the development in insulin antibodies for a total of 104 weeks of treatment. 
The present application for extension of the indication to include children 2-5 years of age is based on 
these  2  trials  NN304-1689  and  NN304-1690.  The  studies  were  discussed  with  the  EMA  through 
scientific  advice  as  part  of  a  post-approval  commitment.  Consequently,  both  trials  have  been 
submitted as part of a FUM and the paediatric article 46, where the Agency has assessed the trials and 
found  them  adequate  to  fulfill  the  FUM.  In  addition,  the  2  trials  are  included  in  the  PIP  that  was 
approved by PDCO and verified for compliance. 
The application implies changes in section 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SPC, a minor change in the RMP and 
changes in section 1 and 3 of the Package leaflet.

Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PK  and  PD  data  in  the  population  below  six  years  are  needed,  as  agreed  on  with  the  PDCO.  Study 
NN1250-3561,  a  6  +  6  months  multi-national,  open-label,  randomised  trial  to  investigate  (among 
other  objectives)  the  pharmacokinetics  of  insulin  detemir  in  different  age  groups  using  a  sparse 
sampling approach and population PK modelling will be performed. Results are awaited.

1.3.2.  Main studies 
Trial  NN304-1689  was  a  52-week  open-label  randomised,  multi-national,  controlled  trial  designed 
both to confirm the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir treatment in children and adolescents aged 2-
16  years  diagnosed  with  type  1  diabetes,  and  to  evaluate  the  potential  effects  of  long-term  insulin 
antibody development. Young children aged 2-5 years were included in this long-term trial in order to 
obtain  clinical  data  in  this  age  group.  Subjects  were  treated  with  either  insulin  detemir  or  Neutral 
Protamine  Hagedorn  (NPH)  insulin  in  a  basal-bolus  regimen  with  rapid  acting  insulin  aspart 
(NovoRapid)  at  meals.  Parameters  were  both  efficacy  (glycaemic  control)  and  safety  including 
development of insulin antibodies. The trial included 10 visits at the clinical trial site. 
Trial  NN304-1690  was  an  open-label,  multi-national,  multi-centre,  single  arm,  52-week  extension  of 
Trial NN304-1689 of insulin detemir administered once or twice daily to children and adolescents (3-17 
years)  diagnosed  with  type  1  diabetes.  At  entry  to  this  trial  the  subjects  had  finalised  52-week 
treatment with insulin detemir in NN304-1689. Subjects treated with NPH insulin in Trial NN304-1689 
were  not  offered  to  continue  in  the  extension,  due  to  the  fact  that  the  primary  endpoint  of  the 
extension trial was to study the development of insulin detemir-insulin aspart cross-reacting antibodies 
following  a  104-week  period  (52  weeks  in  NN304-1689  and  52  weeks  in  NN304-1690)  of  insulin 
detemir  treatment.  All  subjects  in  the  insulin  detemir  arm  who  continued  their  insulin  detemir 
treatment  also  received  insulin  aspart  as  bolus  insulin  before  main  meals and  larger  snacks.  The  key

efficacy  and safety  parameters  were  the  same  as in  Trial  NN304-1689.  The  trial included  a  total  of  5 
visits to the clinical trial sites, of which the first was at the same time as the last visit in Trial NN304-
1689. 
1.3.2.1.  Methods 
The table below gives an overview of the two trials 
Treatments 
Insulin  detemir  or  NPH  insulin  were  to  be  administered  once  or  twice  daily  at  the  same  time  as  the 
basal  insulin  was  given  prior  to  randomisation.  The  insulin  detemir  and  NPH  insulin  injections 
administered s.c. in the thigh using the NovoPenJunior Green injection device. The injection area was 
to  remain  unchanged  throughout  the  trial  even  if  a  single  dose  was  delivered  as  more  than  one 
injection.  Subjects  were  instructed  to  rotate  the  site  of  injection  within  the  area  chosen  in  order  to 
prevent lipohypertrophy. Subjects on a previous once-daily basal insulin regimen were to continue on a 
once-daily regimen. Likewise, subjects on previous twice-daily or more frequent basal insulin regimens 
were to continue on a twice-daily regimen. However, subjects were permitted to switch from a once-
daily  to  a  twice-daily  regimen  (and  vice  versa)  based  on  the  investigators’  judgement  in  relation  to 
titration targets.

All  subjects  received  insulin  aspart  as  bolus  insulin  immediately  before  or  after  main  meals.  Insulin 
aspart  was  administered  s.c.  in  the  abdomen  preprandially  2-4  times  a  day,  in  connection  with  main 
meals using the NovoPenJunior Yellow injection device. Extra doses were permitted in connection with 
larger snacks. Subjects taking bolus insulin postprandially before randomisation were to continue to do 
so. All subjects were switched from their previous insulin regimen to randomly allocated trial treatment 
with insulin detemir or NPH insulin on a unit-to-unit basis. If subjects were on a mixed insulin regimen 
(once or twice daily), the corresponding basal insulin dose was calculated and used as the initial dose. 
If  mixed  insulin  was  used  three  times  daily,  the  basal  component  was  calculated,  and  the  equivalent 
dose was administered as one third in the morning and two thirds in the evening. 
All  subjects  were  to  be  individually  titrated  on  a  continual  basis  according  to  pre-specified  plasma 
glucose  (PG)  targets  adopted  from  the  International  Society  for  Paediatric  and  Adolescent  Diabetes 
(ISPAD) Guidelines (see Table below). 
The table below shows Plasma Glucose Targets for Glycaemic Control 
PG: plasma glucose 
Comparator: 
In  Trial  N304-1689,  NPH  insulin  was  chosen  as  the  comparator  because  it  is  conventionally  used  as 
basal insulin in children and adolescents on a basal-bolus regimen, and because NPH insulin has a well 
established  efficacy  and  safety  profile.  As  one  of  the  secondary  objectives  of  this  trial  was  to 
investigate antibody development during long-term treatment, a comparator with a well-known safety 
profile was considered important. No comparator was included in NN304-1690 as only insulin detemir 
treated subjects were offered to continue in the extension trial. 
In  both  Trial  NN304-1689  and  NN304-1690  insulin  aspart  was  chosen  as  the  bolus  component  of  a 
basal-bolus  regimen.  The  rapid-acting  property  of  insulin  aspart  is  a  particular  advantage  in  this  trial 
population  due  to  a  more  variable  and  unpredictable  life  style  pattern  in  children  and  adolescents. 
Furthermore,  insulin  detemir  is  most  likely  to  be  used  together  with  a  fast-acting  insulin  analogue  in 
clinical practice. 
The  algorithm  used  for  basal  insulin  doses  is  shown  in  Table  below  and  indicates  the  suggested 
increase  in  the  basal  insulin  dose  based  on  the  average  of  the  three  PG  values  measured  before 
breakfast  and  dinner.  If  a  subject  had  only  measured  PG  values  on  2  of  the  last  3  days  prior  to  the 
contact, titration of the basal insulin dose was to be based on these values. If only one measurement 
was  available,  this  was  used  to  assess  the  need  for  insulin  dose  adjustment  at  the  discretion  of  the 
investigator.  The  algorithm  was  only  to  be  used  if  there  had  been  no  major  hypoglycaemic  episodes 
and/or  PG  values  ≤4.0  mmol/L  (≤72  mg/dL)  without  obvious  explanations  between  two  consecutive 
contacts.

Selection criteria: 
Statistical Methods 
Sample size 
The  primary  objective  of  Trial  NN304-1689  was  to  confirm  efficacy  of  insulin  detemir  in  combination 
insulin  aspart  in  terms  of  glycaemic  control.  This  was  done  by  showing  that  insulin  detemir  +  insulin 
aspart is non-inferior to NPH + insulin aspart in terms of glucose lowering effect as assessed by mean 
change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  after  52  weeks  of  treatment  using  a  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.4% 
(absolute). Sample size was determined based on this primary objective. 
The non-inferiority margin of 0.4% (absolute) was chosen in accordance with the FDA guidance. Let D 
be the mean treatment difference for change in HbA1c (insulin detemir + insulin aspart minus NPH + 
insulin  aspart).  The  null-hypothesis  was  tested  against  the  alternative  hypothesis  of  noninferiority  as 
given by H0: D > 0.4% against HA: D ≤ 0.4% 
Operationally  the  null-hypothesis  was  rejected  and  non-inferiority  considered  confirmed  if  the  upper 
bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the mean HbA1c treatment difference was below or 
equal to 0.4%. This is equivalent to using a one-sided test of size 2.5%. 
Sample  size  is  determined  using  a  t-statistic  under  the  assumption  of  a  one-sided  test  of  size  2.5% 
and a zero mean treatment difference (i.e. D=0%). Based on experience from previous insulin detemir 
trial  with  children  and  adolescents  (aged  6-17  years)  a  conservative  estimate  for  the  standard 
deviation (SD) of 1.1% for HbA1c was used in the sample size calculation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/903009/2011  
Page 8/38
 
 
 
 
 
 
As NN304-1689 is a non-inferiority trial sample size was determined such that the anticipated power is 
at  least  85%  in  the  evaluation  of  the  PP  analysis  set.  The  number  of  subjects  excluded  from  the  PP 
analysis set is dependent on the trial design. In this trial an estimate of 20% was used and sample size 
was  ceiled  in  the  FAS  to  have  integer  sample  size  for  each  group  that  adheres  exactly  to  the  group 
allocation  weights  (1:1).  Hence  the  total  number  of  subjects  to  be  randomised  was  344  subjects  in 
order to have at least 85% power in the evaluation of the PP analysis set. 
A total sample size of 344 subjects and a drop-out rate of 20% would yield 274 subjects for evaluation 
of HbA1c. No separate sample size was calculated for young children between 2–5 years, since it was 
considered very difficult to include enough young children in the trial to have sufficient statistical power 
for statistical analysis, due to the low prevalence of diabetes in young children below 6 years. 
Since  the  primary  endpoint  in  Trial  NN304-1690  was  a  safety  endpoint,  only  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints were included in this trial. The secondary efficacy endpoints in this trial were HbA1c and FPG 
at  end  of  the  trial  (after  104  weeks  of  treatment).  As  NN304-1690  was  an  extension  to  trial  NN304-
1689,  no  sample  size  calculation  has  been  made  for  this  trial.  However,  assuming  that  120  were 
treated with insulin detemir in the trial with a drop out rate of 15%, it would be possible to detect, with 
more  than  80%  power,  a  slope  of  0.06  in  cross-reacting  antibody  reduction  over  time  at  a  5% 
significance level. Standard deviation for the cross-reacting antibody measurements was estimated to 
23%. 
Efficacy Analysis Sets 
In Trial NN304-1689 two efficacy analysis sets were defined: 
1.  Full  analysis  set  (FAS)  implemented  according  to  the  intention  to  treat  principle,  used  for 
efficacy analyses: All randomised subjects exposed to at least one dose of trial product with a 
post baseline observation, classified according to randomised treatment. 
2.  Per-protocol  analysis  set  (PP):  All  exposed  subjects  who  completed  the  trial  without 
significantly violating the inclusion/exclusion criteria or other aspects of the protocol considered 
to  potentially  affect  the  efficacy  results  and  who  fulfilled  the  prespecified  criteria  for  being 
included in the PP analysis set. 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on both the FAS and the PP analysis set. All secondary efficacy 
analyses were based on the FAS. 
In Trial NN304-1690 one efficacy analysis set was defined: 
 
Full analysis set (FAS,  NN304-1690) implemented according to the intention to treat principle. 
The  FAS  is  normally  defined  as  all  randomised  subjects  exposed  to  at  least  one  dose  of  trial 
product with a post observation, classified according to randomised treatment. In Trial NN304-
1690, the specific definition of FAS is different, since the subjects are not randomised, namely 
subjects  with  signed  informed  consent  who  are exposed  to  trial  drug  in  the  extension  period. 
Since the NN304-1690 trial is an extension to the NN304-1689 trial, the FAS in NN304-1690 is 
a subset of the FAS in NN304-1689.

Results 
Subject Disposition 
A total of 381 children and adolescents were screened for inclusion in NN304-1689 (see figure below). 
Thirty-three  of  these  were  excluded  because  of  failure  to  meet  all  the  selection  criteria.  The  main 
reason for exclusion was failure to meet the inclusion criterion of HbA1c ≤ 11%. 
Subject disposition for Trial NN304-1689 and Extension Trial NN304-1690 
In  total,  348  children  and  adolescents  were  enrolled  in  the  trial  and  randomly  allocated  to  treatment 
with either insulin detemir or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, in a basal-bolus regimen with 
insulin  aspart  as  the  bolus  insulin.  One  subject  allocated  to  the  NPH  insulin  treatment  arm  withdrew 
consent prior to initiating treatment. Thus, 347 subjects were exposed to trial products and therefore 
included in the FAS. Both the proportion of subjects withdrawn and reasons for withdrawal were similar 
in  the  two  treatment  arms.  The  primary  reason  for  withdrawal  in  both  treatment  arms  was  ‘other’ 
which included unspecified unwillingness to continue (14 subjects).

The proportion of subjects completing the trial was similar with both treatments, as was the proportion 
of subjects who completed the trial without significantly deviating from the protocol in ways that could 
potentially affect the efficacy results (i.e., the PP analysis set). 
Subject disposition by Age Group, NN304-1689 
In  total  146  out  of  164  insulin  detemir  treated  subjects,  who  completed  Trial  NN304-1689,  were 
included in Trial NN304-1690. Only subjects who were treated with insulin detemir in Trial NN304-1689 
were offered participation in the extension Trial NN304-1690. The majority of the 18 subjects who did 
not wish to participate in Trial NN304-1690 were in the age group 6-12 years. 
The  subjects  were  distributed  between  the  three  age  groups  with  37  young  children  (2-5  years),  59 
children (6-12 years) and 50 adolescents (13-16 years). 
Five subjects were withdrawn during the extension trial NN304-1690, of these one subject from the 2-
5  years  age  group  (other  reasons:  Parents  decision),  one  subject  from  the  6-12  years  age  group 
(inefficient therapy) and three subjects from the 13-16 years age group (non-compliance). No subjects 
were withdrawn from the extension trial due to adverse events.

Primary Endpoint – HbA1c, End of Trial 
The  primary  objective  in Trial  NN304-1689  was  to  compare  the  glycaemic control  after 12  months  of 
treatment  with  insulin  detemir  or  NPH  insulin  administered  once  or  twice  daily  in  combination  with 
mealtime  insulin  aspart  in  children  and  adolescents  with  type  1  diabetes.Treatment  with  insulin 
detemir was shown to be non-inferior to NPH insulin as measured by HbA1c after 52 weeks. The upper 
confidence  interval  for  the  estimated  treatment  differences  in  HbA1c  was  less  than  the  prespecified 
criterion of 0.4%. The estimated mean absolute change in HbA1c was 0.34% with insulin detemir and 
0.22% with NPH insulin, Table below. These results were consistent with the corresponding analysis for 
the PP analysis set. 
Comparison of HbA1c (%) and Change in HbA1c after 52 Weeks, NN304-1689 
Mean  HbA1c  increased  over  52  weeks  in  both  treatment  arms,  Figure  below.  Although  HbA1c 
decreased initially with NPH insulin over the first 12 weeks of treatment, the mean level was similar to 
that  with  insulin  detemir  after  52  weeks.  The  initial  decrease  in  HbA1c  in  the  NPH  insulin  treatment 
arm observed over the first 12 weeks of treatment was not sustained. Similar observations were made 
for the PP analysis set.

The slight increase in HbA1c observed with both insulin detemir and NPH insulin described for the total 
group  is  largely  attributable  to  suboptimal  glycaemic  control  in  the  subgroup  of  adolescents  (13-16 
years). The figure below shows the mean HbA1c over time for age-group 2-5 years (full analysis set):

As for subjects who continued insulin detemir treatment in the extension trial NN304-1690 for a total 
of  104  weeks,  glycaemic  control  measured  as  mean  HbA1c  was  relatively  stable  during  the  whole 
treatment period with a slight increase in observed mean HbA1c from 8.4% at baseline of Trial NN304-
1689  to  8.7%  by  the  end  of  Trial  NN304-1690.    Mean  HbA1c  was  lowest  for  the  young  children  (2-5 
year)  and  highest  for  the  adolescents  (13-16  year)  throughout  the  whole  treatment  period  of  104 
weeks.

Mean  FPG  varied  over  time  for  all  age  groups  and  treatment.  There  was  a  consistent  trend  towards 
lower  mean  FPG  values  after  52  weeks  with  insulin  detemir  compared  to  NPH  insulin  in  all  three  age 
groups.  
When looking at mean FPG for the insulin detemir group throughout the whole treatment period of 104 
weeks,  mean  FPG  was  highest  for  the  children  (6-12  year),  whereas  mean  FPG  was  lowest  for  the 
young children (2-5 year) except at end of trial where mean FPG for subjects in the young children was 
similar to the mean FPG for the total group and lowest for the adolescents (13-16 year). 
Secondary Endpoint – Nine-point Self-measured Plasma Glucose Profiles by Age Groups 
The mean 9-point SMPG profiles appeared similar after 52 weeks of treatment with insulin detemir or 
NPH  insulin.  The  mean  pre-breakfast  SMPG  level  at  the  end  of  the  profile  tended  to  be  lower  with 
insulin detemir than with NPH insulin in young children aged 2-5 years Figure below, but this trend was 
not evident in older children or adolescents.

1689. 
Secondary Endpoint – Nocturnal Self-measured Plasma Glucose 
Although there were some differences between treatments over time, particularly in young children (2-
5 years) and children (6-12 years), mean nocturnal SMPG levels remained similar to baseline after 52 
weeks with insulin detemir. 
Target Plasma Glucose by Age Groups 
Based on the latest 9-point SMPG profile in the trial, the proportion of subjects who achieved the target 
pre-breakfast  and  pre-dinner  plasma  glucose  concentration  of  4.0–7.0  mmol/L  (72–126  mg/dL)  and 
the nocturnal plasma glucose concentration of  ≥ 3.6 mmol/L (≥65 mg/dL) after 52 weeks is shown in 
Table  below.  The  percentage  of  subjects  reaching  the  targets  varied  somewhat  between  the  age 
groups,  but  in  general,  young  children  aged  2–5  years  and  children  aged  6-12  years  were  more 
successful  at  achieving  the  target  pre-breakfast  PG  values  with  insulin  detemir  than  with  NPH  insulin 
after 52 weeks, whereas more subjects treated with NPH insulin reached pre-dinner target.

Subjects  having  reached  targeted  glucose  values  at  end  of  52  weeks  treatment  by  age 
group, FAS, NN304-1689 
With regard to the target plasma glucose values after 104 weeks of treatment 45.9% of the subjects in 
the youngest age-group reached the pre-breakfast plasma glucose target, whereas approximately one 
third  of  the  children  and  adolescents  reached  the  pre-breakfast  and  approximately  one  third  of  all 
subjects reached the pre-dinner SMPG targets of plasma glucose levels between 4.0 and 7.0 mmol/L. 
Between 6.8% and 14% of the subjects in the three age groups reached both plasma glucose targets. 
Results analysed by sex 
The overall observed mean change in HbA1c from baseline to 52 weeks differed slightly for boys and 
girls  in  both  treatment  groups:  females  0.10  (SD  1.18),  males  0.35  (SD  1.37).  By  the  end  of  104 
weeks of treatment the change in mean HbA1c for insulin detemir treated girls was 0.33% and 0.40% 
for insulin detemir treated boys. 
Dose Development by Age Group 
The development of mean daily basal insulin doses for the young children (2-5 years), the children (6-
12  years)  and  adolescents  (13-16  years)  was  generally  consistent  with  that  observed  with  the  total 
group.

Discussion on efficacy  
The persistence of efficacy in young children, children and adolescents was evaluated over a period of 
52 weeks in Trial NN304-1689 and for a subset of insulin detemir treated children over a period of 104 
weeks in Trial NN304-1690. 
The  trial  NN304-1689  populations  in  the  two  treatment  arms  were  generally  well  matched,  with  the 
exception of differences for sex and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). The proportion of girls allocated to 
insulin detemir (53%) was higher than in the NPH insulin treatment arm (43%) - and this was true for 
all  age  groups.  Also,  a  slightly  lower  mean  FPG  was  reported  at  baseline  in  the  insulin  detemir  arm 
(8.36 mmol/L) compared with the NPH insulin arm (8.70 mmol/L). Both of these imbalances might be 
“favourable” for the detemir treatment evaluation; however it is shown to be without significance. 
The subjects included in the extension study NN304-1690 did not differ significantly with regard to any 
of the baseline characteristics from the population in the detemir arm of study NN304-1689.  A higher 
percentage of girls was included in the two lowest age groups (young children 2-5 years and children 
6-12 years), while the opposite was observed for adolescents 13-16 years).

Mean HbA1c developed similarly in both treatment arms, increasing slightly from 8.4% to 8.5-8.6% by 
the  end  of  52  weeks  of  treatment.  For  subjects  treated  with  insulin  detemir  mean  HbA1c  remained 
relatively  stable  during  the  additional  52  weeks  of  treatment.  By  the  end  of  104  weeks  of  treatment 
mean  HbA1c  in  the  insulin  detemir  arm  was  8.7%.  When  entering  the  extension  period,  HbA1c  was 
lower for the young children (8.15%) than for the children (8.52%) and adolescents (8.93%). 
Mean  daily  basal  and  bolus  insulin  doses  were  similar  with insulin  detemir  treatment  and  NPH  insulin 
treatment  throughout  the  trial.  Mean  daily  doses  of  insulin  detemir  and  NPH  insulin  increased  most 
markedly during the first 12 weeks of treatment, possibly reflecting dose titration at the beginning of 
the  trial.  The  mean  daily  basal  insulin  doses  continued  to  increase  at  a  lower  but  steady  rate  for  the 
remaining 40 weeks of the trial. This might be related to the normal growth of the children. 
In both detemir and NPH insulin treatment groups, HbA1c levels increased during the 52 weeks of the 
study.  Detemir  was  non-inferior  to  NPH  insulin  in  HbA1c  values,  using  a    non-inferiority  margin  of 
0.4%.  Numerically,  the  HbA1c  values  were  lower  in  the  NPH  insulin  group,  compared  to  the  detemir 
treatment group. The efficacy of insulin detemir in the young age subset of 2-5 years was comparable 
with  the  total  group  (including  young  children).  In  this  subgroup,  insulin  detemir  showed  numerically 
lower HbA1c levels over time in comparison with NPH insulin group. 
In Study NN304-1689 the secondary endpoint FPG in the detemir group was similar to the FPG in the 
NPH insulin group. In young subject, age 2-5 years old, the same trend was seen in FPG-values. 
In Study NN304-1689 the secondary endpoint 9-point SMPG in the detemir group was similar to the 9-
point SMPG in the NPH insulin group. In the young subject group, age 2-5 years old, the same trend 
was seen in 9-point SMPG profiles. 
There  were  no  evident  differences  in  the  overall  persistence  of  efficacy  among  the  three  age  groups, 
and  no  notable  differences  in  insulin  dosing  or  HbA1c  development  between  insulin  detemir  and  NPH 
insulin  for  young  children  (2-5  years),  children  (6-12  years)  or  adolescents  (13-16  years).  Similarly 
when looking at HbA1c and insulin dosing for the insulin detemir treated subjects of 104 weeks overall 
persistence of efficacy was preserved in all three age groups. No statistical tests were performed due to 
the relatively small number of subjects in the subpopulations. 
1.4.  Clinical safety 
In this efficacy and safety Trial NN304-1689 347 patients were included, eligible subjects were insulin 
detemir  naïve,  2-16  years  of  age  and  diagnosed  with  type  1  diabetes  for  a  minimum  of  12  months 
prior to inclusion in this trial. Furthermore, the subjects were to have a total daily insulin dose ≤ 2.00 
units  (U)/kg  and  the  screening  HbA1c  was  to  be  ≤  11%.  Criteria  set  for  maximum BMI  correlated  to 
age  were  to  be  fulfilled.  Subjects  with  clinically  significant  concomitant  diseases,  including  impaired 
renal and hepatic function, were not to be included in this trial. Since a stable diabetes treatment for at 
least 1 year was wanted in this trial, children below the age of 2 years were not included. Since Trial 
NN304-1689,  plus  the  extension  trial  (Trial  NN304-1690)  were  to  run  for  a  total  of  2  years,  subjects 
above 16 years were excluded to avoid having adult subjects in the trial.  
The  key  safety  parameters  were  insulin  antibodies,  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia,  standard  deviation 
(SD) score for weight, adverse events (AEs), incidence of ketoacidosis requiring hospitalisation, safety 
laboratory  parameters  and  insulin  dose.  Trial  NN304-1689  included  a  total  of  10  visits  to  the  clinical 
trial  sites  and  8  telephone  contacts  during  the  treatment  period.  At  the  final  visit,  subjects  in  the 
insulin  detemir  treatment  arm  were  offered  to  continue  in  the  52-week  extension  efficacy  and  safety 
trial  in  which  the  treatment  and  the  key  efficacy  and  safety  parameters  were  the  same  as  in  Trial 
NN304-1689. The trial included a total of 5 visits to the clinical trial sites, of which the first was at the 
Assessment report  
EMA/903009/2011  
Page 19/38
 
 
 
 
same  time  as  the  last  visit  in  Trial  NN304-1689.  Safety  surveillance  was  performed  on  an  ongoing 
basis by an internal safety committee in Novo Nordisk A/S, headed by Global Safety. 
1.4.1.  Patient exposure 
In Trial NN304-1689 the number of subject years of exposure and the mean number of treatment days 
were  similar  in  the  two  treatment  groups  for  the  total  group  as  well  as  for  the  three  age  subgroups 
(see table below).  
Exposure by Age Group (Mean Values), SAS, NN304-1689. 
A summary of exposure for the subjects continuing in the extension trial NN304-1690 is presented in 
table below. 
Exposure  by  Age  Group  (Mean  Values),  SAS,  Insulin  Detemir  Treated  Subjects  in  Trial 
NN304-1690 Whole treatment period. 
Insulin dose 
The ratio of insulin detemir/NPH insulin mean daily insulin doses at end of trial was close to 1 for both 
basal and bolus insulin, meaning that mean doses were similar in the two treatment groups. 
Mean  daily  insulin  detemir  doses  per  kg  body  weight  continued  to  increase  throughout  the  whole 
treatment  period,  whereas  the  mean  daily  insulin  aspart  doses  were  relatively  stable  throughout  the 
trial. 
1.4.2.  Adverse events 
In Trial NN304-1689 the overall percentage of subjects with events and the event rates of all AEs and 
of non-serious AEs were similar in the two treatment groups, while the percent of subjects with events 
and  the  event  rate  (events  per  100  years  of  exposure)  of  SAEs  were  lower  with  insulin  detemir  (8% 
and  9.5,  respectively)  than  with  NPH  insulin  (12%  and  14.7,  respectively).  Few  of  the  AEs  in  either 
treatment  group  were  severe,  and  the  event  rate  of  severe  AEs  was  lower  with  insulin  detemir  (4.2) 
Assessment report  
EMA/903009/2011

than  with  NPH  insulin  (9.2).  The  event  rate  of  AEs  possibly  or  probably  related  to  trial  product  was 
similar in the two treatment groups.  
Throughout  the  whole  treatment  period  of  104  weeks,  116  (79.5%)  of  the  146  subjects  experienced 
714 AEs and 12 (8.2%) subjects experienced 17 SAE; 4 of the SAEs were assessed as being possible 
or probable related to insulin detemir and 1 SAE as being probable related to insulin aspart. No SAEs 
were assessed as possible for insulin aspart. 
In  the  age  groups  2-5  years  and  13-16  years  the  rate  of  AEs  per  100  years  of  exposure  with  insulin 
detemir (294.9 and 207.0, respectively) was lower than with NPH insulin (432.4 and 357.2), while the 
rate of AEs was higher with insulin detemir (412.4) than with NPH insulin (286.5) in the age group 6-
12 years. For subjects continuing insulin detemir treatment in the extension trial NN304-1690 the rate 
of  AEs  were  also  higher  in  the  young  children  and  children  age  subgroups  (243.1  and  325.9, 
respectively) than in the adolescent age subgroup (155.4). 
Table below shows that injection site disorders, skin disorders and metabolic disorders were the most 
frequently reported AEs considered possibly or probably related to basal insulin with more injection site 
erythema in the insulin detemir group and more hypoglycaemia in the NPH insulin group. The display 
of  AE  by  relation  to  basal  insulin  was  similar  for  subjects  continuing  insulin  detemir  treatment  in  the 
extension Trial NN304-1690 for up to 104 weeks.

Adverse Events Probably or Possibly Related to Basal Insulin by MedDRA 
System Organ Class, SAS, NN304-1689 
The  most  common  AEs  in  both  treatment  groups  of  Trial  NN304-1689  and  in  the  insulin  detemir 
treated subjects continuing treatment for 104 weeks were upper respiratory tract infections (including 
nasopharyngitis and pharyngitis), headache and gastroenteritis. 
1.4.2.1.  Serious adverse events and deaths 
The rate of SAEs decreased with increasing age in the age subgroups, with the adolescents having the 
lowest events rates, (see tables below): 
Assessment report  
EMA/903009/2011  
Page 22/38
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  most  common  SAEs  were  within  infections,  gastrointestinal  disorders  and  metabolic  disorders  in 
both treatment groups and age subgroups. 
No deaths were reported in any of the 2 trials. 
Body weight 
In  Trial  NN304-1689  the  mean  change  in  body  weight  from  baseline  to  52  weeks  of  treatment  was 
lower with insulin detemir (3.2 kg) than with NPH insulin (4.1 kg). 
To be able to compare weight between the two treatment groups in the various age groups of children, 
weight  SD  scores  were  used.  The  SD  score  is  a  standardisation  by  age  and  sex  of  a  reference 
population to show the variation of a measured value from the mean value of the reference population 
for the relevant age and sex. An SD score of ‘0’ represents the mean value for the relevant age group 
of the chosen reference population, and a score of ‘-2’ represents a value being 2 SDs below the mean 
value for the relevant age group of the chosen reference population. 
The  weight  SD  score  was  planned  to  be  based  on  local  standard  growth  curves,  since  there  are 
differences  between  the  participating  countries  in  the  trial,  but  in  several  countries,  these  data  were 
not available to use for this purpose. The central derivation of the SD scores based on standard growth 
curves from the UK is therefore an approximation with a certain amount of uncertainty included. 
Assessment report  
EMA/903009/2011  
Page 23/38
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  mean  change  in  weight  SD  score  from  baseline  to  52  weeks  of  treatment  was  -0.07  with  insulin 
detemir  and  0.07  with  NPH  insulin.  This  means  that  the  mean  weight  with  insulin  detemir  decreased 
towards the standard mean value, while the mean weight with NPH insulin increased during the trial. 
As for subjects treated with insulin detemir continuing treatment for 104 weeks the mean body weight 
increased 6.8 kg from baseline (Visit 2) and the mean change in weight SD score from baseline to 104 
weeks was -0.07. 
Mean Standard Deviation Score of Body Weight by Visit, SAS, Trial NN304-1689 
The mean difference between the two treatment groups in estimated weight SD score at the end of the 
Trial  NN304-1689  was  statistically  significant:  insulin  detemir  –  NPH  insulin  was  -0.15,  95%  C.I.:  [-
0.23; -0.07].

Hypoglycaemic Episodes 
In  Trial  NN304-1689  the  percentage  of  subjects  who  experienced  hypoglycaemic  episodes  during  the 
treatment period was lower with insulin detemir (95) than with NPH insulin (98), and the rate (number 
of  episodes  divided  by  the  number  of  subject  years  of  exposure)  was  also  lower  with  insulin  detemir 
than with NPH insulin, Table below. 
Summary of All Hypoglycaemic Episodes, SAS, NN304-1689 
Of  the  subjects  continuing  insulin  detemir  treatment  for  104  weeks,  99.3%  experienced  one  or  more 
hypoglycaemic  episodes.  In  total  16074  hypoglycaemic  episodes,  corresponding  to  a  rate  of  55.6 
episodes  per  exposure  year,  were  reported  during  the  whole  insulin  detemir  treatment  period.  The 
majority of the hypoglycaemic episodes occurred during the day (diurnal) and were mild in severity or 
were  biochemical  hypoglycaemic  episodes  (PG<3.6mmol/L  with  no  signs  or  symptoms).  A  total  of  6 
subjects reported 7 severe hypoglycaemic episodes of which 4 were nocturnal events: 
Young children: Two severe hypoglycaemic episodes in two subjects: Subject 202002 experienced one 
severe  event  of  hypoglycaemic  unconsciousness  after  545  days  of  treatment.  Subject  352010 
experienced  one  nocturnal  event  of  severe  hypoglycaemic  unconsciousness  after  406  days  of 
treatment. 
Children:  Two  severe  hypoglycaemic  episodes  in  two  subjects:  Subject  152002  experienced  one 
nocturnal event of severe hypoglycaemia after 459 days of treatment and Subject 603007 experienced 
one event of severe hypoglycaemia after 63 days of treatment. 
Adolescents:  Three  severe  hypoglycaemic  episodes  in  two  subjects:  Subject  403006  experienced  two 
nocturnal  events  of  severe  hypoglycaemia  after  493  and  503  days  treatment.  Both  events  were 
reported  as  SAEs  and  assessed  as  being  possibly  related  to  insulin  detemir  and  unlikely  related  to 
insulin  aspart  treatment.  The  subject  recovered  from  the  events  on  the  same  day.  Subject  301005 
experienced one event of severe hypoglycaemia after 250 days of treatment. 
The  rate  of  hypoglycaemic  episodes  was  lower  with  insulin  detemir  than  with  NPH  insulin  in  all  three 
age subgroups, Table below.

Summary of All Hypoglycaemic Episodes by age group, SAS, NN304-1689 
The  number  of  treatment  emergent  hypoglycaemic  episodes  for  subjects  treated  with  insulin  detemir 
for  104  weeks,  were  slightly  higher  in  the  children  (6-12  year  age  group)  compared  with  the  young 
children (2-5 year age group) and the adolescents (13-16 year age group). 
Laboratory findings 
There were no significant findings among haematology and biochemistry tests. 
Antibodies 
Estimated cross-reacting antibodies over 104 weeks of treatment with insulin detemir are presented in 
figure  below.  As  illustrated,  the  development  of  antibodies  over  104  weeks  could  be  modelled  by  a 
parabola,  with  a  positive  slope  of  the  parabola  during  the  first  year,  maximum  observed  after  52-
weeks  and  then  a  negative  slope  of  the  parabola  during  the  extension  period.  In  other  words,  the 
estimated  level  of  cross-reacting  antibodies  increased  during  the  first  year  of  treatment  with  insulin 
detemir  and  insulin  aspart,  peaked  after  1  year  and  then  decreased  during  the  second  year  of 
treatment.

Mean cross-reacting antibodies, mean insulin detemir and mean insulin aspart antibodies over time by 
age group for subjects in both trials are presented in figures below. The development of mean cross-
reacting  antibodies  was  similar  for  all  three  age  groups  during  the  trial.  A  slight  increase  in  mean 
cross-reacting  antibodies  for  the  young  children  and  a  slight  decrease  for  the  adolescents  was 
observed towards the end of the trial. Mean insulin detemir specific antibody levels were slightly higher 
for  the  children  (6-12  year  age  group)  compared  to  the  total  mean  level,  whereas  the  mean  insulin 
detemir  specific  antibody  levels  in  adolescents  (13-16  year  age  group)  were  slightly  lower.  Mean 
insulin  aspart  specific  antibody  levels  were  slightly  higher  for  the  adolescents  compared  to  the  total 
mean  level,  whereas  the  mean  insulin  aspart  specific  antibody  levels  in  the  young  children  (2-5  year

No drug interactions have been studied in Trial NN304-1689 and NN304-1690. 
1.4.2.4.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There was no difference between the treatment groups in AEs leading to a change in insulin dose. 
1.4.2.5.  Post marketing experience 
The post-marketing safety information for insulin detemir received by Novo Nordisk A/S is reported in 
Periodic Safety Update Reports according to the regulatory requirements.  
Discussion on safety 
The safety profile of insulin detemir was in the 2 studies included in this application in agreement with 
the safety profile shown in previous insulin detemir studies.  
The  estimated  weight  SD  score  at  the  end  of  the  trial  was  statistically  significantly  lower  with  insulin 
detemir than with NPH insulin, which means that the weight returned towards the mean value for the 
reference  population  instead  of  continuing  towards  relatively  higher  levels  with  increasing  risk  of 
obesity. The lower weight SD score with insulin detemir corresponds to the lower BMI reported in the 
previous children trial. The central derivation of the SD scores based on standard growth curves from 
the UK was used, since in several countries standard growth curves were not available. Therefore, an 
approximation with a certain amount of bias was included in this measurement. 
The  estimated  level  of  cross-reacting  antibodies  increased  during  the  first  year  of  treatment  with 
insulin detemir and insulin aspart, peaked after 1 year and then decreased during the second year of 
treatment. The development of cross-reacting antibodies was similar for all 3 age-groups.  
The  overall  percentage  of  subjects  with  adverse  events  were  similar  among  children  treated  with 
insulin  detemir  and  NPH  insulin,  and  in  the  age-group  2-5  years  the  rate  of  AEs  per  100  years  of 
exposure with insulin detemir was lower than with NPH insulin.  
During  both  studies,  most  subjects  experienced  hypoglycaemic  events.  Percentages  of  subjects  who 
experienced hypoglycaemic events and their overall rates were lower for subjects treated with insulin 
detemir  in  comparison  with  the  NPH  insulin  treated  children,  in  study  NN304-1689.  Seven  severe 
hypoglycaemic events occurred during the 104 weeks period in the detemir insulin treated children. In 
the children aged  2-5 years, the rate of hypoglycaemic events was comparable with the whole group 
and the detemir group experienced less hypoglycemic events, compared to young children in the NPH 
treatment group. 
The  current  data  suggests  that  insulin  detemir  has  a  numerically  lower,  although  not  statistically 
significant,  rate  of  all  nocturnal  hypoglycaemic  episodes.  As  discussed  in  the  PDCO,  the  collection  of 
nocturnal  hypoglycaemic  events  is  not  considered  optimal.  Many  children  are  not  symptomatic  and 
may sleep apparently calmly, while in hypoglycaemia. However, this phenomenon is only detectable by 
multiple (2-3) time points or by using CGM devices. 
Furthermore the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes was lower with insulin detemir than with NPH insulin 
in  all  three  age  groups  and  within  the  insulin  detemir  arm  the  number  of  treatment  emergent 
hypoglycaemic episodes was lower in the young children than in children 6-12 years. 
In  the  longer  term  there  have  been  associations  and  concerns  raised  by  an  increased  prevalence  of 
cancers in those receiving long acting insulin analogues. These are appropriately addressed in the Risk 
Management plan.

Significance of paediatric studies 
This application was based on two studies: 
Study NN304-1689 was a 52-week, Multinational, Multi-Centre, Open-Labelled, Randomised, Parallel, 
Efficacy  and  Safety  Comparison  of  Insulin  Detemir  and  NPH  Insulin  in  Children  and  Adolescents  2-16 
years  with  Type  1  Diabetes  on  a  Basal-Bolus  Regimen  with  Insulin  Aspart  as  Bolus  Insulin.  Young 
children aged 2-5 years were included in this long-term trial in order to obtain clinical data in this age 
group.  
Study  NN304-1690  was  a  52-Week,  Multinational,  Multi-Centre,  Open-Labelled  Extension  to  trial 
NN304-1689  of  Insulin  Detemir  in  Children  and  Adolescents  3-17  years  with  Type  1  Diabetes  on  a 
Basal-Bolus  Regimen  with  Insulin  Aspart  as  Bolus  Insulin.  Subjects  treated  with  NPH  insulin  in  Trial 
NN304-1689 were not offered to continue in the extension.  
The persistence of efficacy in young children, children and adolescents was evaluated over a period of 
52 weeks in Trial NN304-1689 and for a subset of insulin detemir treated children over a period of 104 
weeks in Trial NN304-1690. 
The effect of insulin detemir on HbA1C was similar when compared to NPH; HbA1c increased slightly 
from 8.4% to 8.5-8.6% by the end of 52 weeks of treatment. For subjects treated with insulin detemir 
mean HbA1c remained relatively stable during the additional 52 weeks of treatment. Mean daily basal 
and  bolus  insulin  doses  were  similar  in  between  the  two  groups  throughout  the  trial.  There  were  no 
evident  differences  in  the  overall  persistence  of  efficacy,  in  insulin  dosing  or  HbA1c  development 
between  insulin  detemir  and  NPH  insulin  for  young  children  (2-5  years),  children  (6-12  years)  or 
adolescents (13-16 years).  
The safety profile of insulin detemir was similar to that observed in previous insulin detemir studies. 
The overall percentage of subjects with adverse events was similar among children treated with insulin 
detemir  and  NPH  insulin. In  the  age-group  2-5  years  the  rate  of  AEs  per  100  years  of  exposure  with 
insulin detemir was lower than with NPH insulin. Furthermore the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes was 
lower  with insulin  detemir  than  with  NPH  insulin  in  all  three  age  groups  (2-5,  6-12  and  13-16  years) 
and  within  the  insulin  detemir  arm  the  number  of  treatment  emergent  hypoglycaemic  episodes  was 
lower  in  the  young  children  than  in  children  6-12  years.  The  estimated  level  of  cross-reacting 
antibodies increased during the first year of treatment with insulin detemir and insulin aspart, peaked 
after  1  year  and  then  decreased  during  the  second  year  of  treatment.  The  development  of  cross-
reacting antibodies was similar for all 3 age-groups. 
Based on the results described above the efficacy and safety data for the 2-5 years old and safety data 
for  the  6-16  years  old  generated  from  studies NN304-1689  and  NN304-1690  (completed  after  the 
entry into force of the paediatric regulation) are considered of importance and clinical relevance for the 
paediatric  population  (Guideline  on  the  format  and  content  of  applications  for  agreement  or 
modification of a paediatric investigation plan and requests for waivers or deferrals and concerning the 
operation of the compliance check and on criteria for assessing significant studies (2008/C 243/01)). It 
has to be noted that insulin detemir is already authorised for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, 
adolescents and children aged 6–17 years. 
The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  NN304-1689,  which  is  contained  in  the  agreed  Paediatric 
Investigation Plan and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered significant.

(single case

PSURs, ASRs/DSURs) 
Proposed Risk Minimisation Activities 
Addressed in the SmPC, Sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.7 and 4.8. 
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for 
use: Omission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous 
physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high 
in relation to the insulin 
requirement. Patients, whose blood glucose control is 
greatly 
improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may 
experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia, and should be advised accordingly. Usual 
warning symptoms may disappear in patients with 
longstanding diabetes. Concomitant illness, especially 
infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the 
patient's insulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in 
the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or 
thyroid gland can require changes in insulin dose. When 
patients are transferred between different types of insulin 
medicinal products, the early warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced 
than those experienced with their previous insulin. 
Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction: Beta-
blocking agents may mask the symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia. Alcohol may intensify or reduce the 
hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. Section 4.7 Effects on 
ability to drive and use machines: The patient’s ability 
to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of 
hypoglycaemia. This may constitute a risk in situations 
where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. 
driving a car or operating machinery). Patients should be 
advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while 
driving. This is particularly important in those who have 
reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of 
hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: The most frequently 
reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may 
occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the 
insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to 
unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in 
temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or 
even death. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually 
occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale 
skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, 
unusual 
tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in 
concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision 
changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. From clinical 
investigations, it is known that major hypoglycaemia, 
defined as requirement for third party intervention, occurs 
in approximately 6% of the patients treated with Levemir. 
Hypoglycaemia is listed as very common (≥1/10) adverse 
reaction.

(single case 
reporting, PSURs, 
ASRs/DSURs) 
Addressed in the SmPC, Sections 4.4 and 4.8. 
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for 
use: As with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions 
may occur and include pain, redness, hives, inflammation, 
bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the 
injection site within a given area may help to reduce or 
prevent these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few 
days to a few weeks. On rare occasions, injection site 
reactions may require discontinuation of Levemir. 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: Injection site reactions 
are seen more frequently during treatment with Levemir
than with human insulin products. These reactions include 
pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching at the injection site. Most of the injection site 
reactions are minor and of a transitory nature, i.e. they 
normally disappear during continued treatment in a few 
days to a few weeks.

Based on study results, the following titration guideline is recommended for adult diabetes patients: 
[. . . ] 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of Levemir were demonstrated in children and adolescents and  children aged 
6 to 172 years and above in studies up to 612 months (see section 5.1). 
As  with  all  insulin  medicinal  products,  in  children  and  adolescents,  glucose  monitoring  should  be 
intensified and the insulin detemir dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Levemir has not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. 
[. . . ] 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
[. . . ] 
In  long-term  treatment  trials  in  patients  with  type  1  diabetes  receiving  a  basal-bolus  insulin 
therapy, fasting plasma glucose was improved with Levemir compared with NPH insulin when given as 
basal/bolus therapy including in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Glycaemic control (HbA1c) 
with Levemir was is comparable to NPH insulin, with a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia and no 
associated weight gain. 
In clinical trials using basal bolus insulin therapy, the overall rates of hypoglycaemia with Levemir and 
NPH insulin were similar. Analyses of nocturnal hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes showed 
a  significantly  lower  risk  of  minor  nocturnal  hypoglycaemia  (able  to  self-treat  and  confirmed  by 
capillary blood glucose less than 2.8 mmol/l or 3.1 mmol/l if expressed as  plasma glucose) than with 
NPH  insulin,  whereas  no  difference  was  seen  in  type  2  diabetes.  Furthermore,  the  overall  risk  of 
nocturnal  hypoglycaemia  in  children  and  adolescents  aged  6  to  17 years  with  type  1  diabetes  was 
significantly lower with Levemir compared to NPH insulin. 
Antibody development has been observed with the use of Levemir. However, this does  not appear to 
have any impact on glycaemic control. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of Levemir has been studied for up to 12 months, in two randomised 
controlled  clinical  trials  in  adolescents  and  children  (n=694  in  total);  one  of  the  studies 
included in total 82 children aged 2-5 years. Both trials demonstrated that glycaemic control 
(HbA1c) with Levemir is comparable to NPH insulin when given as basal-bolus therapy, using 
a  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.4%.  In  addition  less  weight  gain  (SD  score,  weight  corrected 
for gender and age) was observed with Levemir than with NPH insulin.  
The  trial  including  children  above  2 years  was  extended  for  an  additional  12 months  (total 
of 24 months treatment data) to assess antibody formation after long-term treatment with 
Levemir. After an increase in insulin antibodies during the first year, the insulin antibodies 
decreased  during  the  second  year  to  a  level  slightly  higher  than  pre-trial  level.  Results 
indicate that antibody development had no negative effect on glycaemic control and Levemir 
dose.

2.  Overall discussions and benefit-risk assessment 
In support of the extension of indication 2 clinical studies were submitted. 
The already completed Trial NN304-1689 and ongoing extension Trial NN304-1690 at submission were 
agreed on, during the paediatric investigation procedure by the PDCO. The SA, provided in 2005 by the 
CHMP,  was  not  followed  completely.  As  agreed  on  during  the  PIP  procedure  three  additional  studies, 
including NN1250-3561, will cover the currently missing data regarding PK-data in small children and 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia data in children using CGM devices. 
The data that were collected in the studies from the whole 2-year treatment period suggest that insulin 
detemir is safe and efficacious and can be used in children between 2 and 16 years of age. 
In the basal-bolus treatment regimen, the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir was compared to NPH 
insulin  when  both  were  used  once  or  twice  daily  according  to  pre-trial  regimen,  in  combination  with 
insulin  aspart  as  mealtime  insulin.  Insulin  detemir  was  as  safe  and  efficacious  as  NPH  insulin  in 
treatment of children and adolescents from 2-16 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Children treated 
with  insulin  detemir  had  less  hypoglycaemia,  less  weight  gain  and  fewer  SAEs  than  children  treated 
with NPH insulin. 
Potential benefits that may be expected from the use of insulin detemir compared with NPH insulin in 
young  children  (2-5  years)  are  related  to  a  lower  within-subject  variation  in  fasting  plasma  glucose, 
less  hypoglycaemia  (both  24h  and  nocturnal  hypoglycaemia,  which  was  not  off-set  by  an  increase  in 
diurnal  episodes)  and  less  inappropriate  weight  gain.  The  overall  AE  profile  for  young  children  was 
similar to that of NPH insulin. 
Obtaining good glycaemic control is a challenge for children and adolescents, due to growth, variable 
lifestyle,  hormonal  changes,  and  the  need  of  assistance  with  insulin  injection.  The  titration  of  insulin 
doses  to  obtain  the  target  plasma  glucose  values  led  to  similar  HbA1c  and  fasting  plasma  glucose 
values with similar insulin doses per kg body weight in the two treatment groups. The ratio of insulin 
detemir/NPH  insulin  mean  daily  insulin  doses  at  end  of  trial  was  close  to  1  for  both  basal  and  bolus 
insulin,  meaning  that  mean  doses  were  similar  in  the  two  treatment  groups.  For  the  insulin  detemir 
treated  subjects  continuing  treatment  for  the  complete  2-year  period  mean  HbA1c  levels  were 
relatively stable, with a slight increase over time (mean HbA1c for all subjects at baseline was 8.43% 
and  at  end  of  trial  8.74%).  Throughout  the  2-year  period,  mean  HbA1c  was  lowest  for  the  young 
children  and  highest  for  the  adolescents.  Overall,  children  in  the  2-5  years  of  age  group  maintained 
better glycaemic control, compared to the older children. 
The  increase  in  HbA1c  seen  in  both  treatment  groups  may,  as  suggested  by  the  MAH,  reflect  the 
general difficulties in treating children for whom many factors, including: fear of hypoglycaemia, social 
status, different country distribution, available help in day care or school and highly variable lifestyle, 
influence the glycaemic control. It might be speculated whether the titration of the insulin doses was 
sufficient or whether further intensification of the insulin treatment was hindered by hypoglycaemia or 
fear of, especially nocturnal, hypoglycaemia. 
The  observed  changes  in  the  insulin  antibodies  of  children  with  type  1  diabetes  treated  with  insulin 
detemir in a basal-bolus regimen with insulin aspart as mealtime insulin over two years do not seem to 
present  a  safety  concern.  The  estimated  antibody  profile  based  on  data  from  the  whole  2-year 
treatment  period  showed  that  after  an  increase  in  insulin  antibodies  during  the  first  year,  the  insulin 
antibodies decreased during the second year to a level slightly higher than pre-trial level.  
In conclusion, although the number of  children 2-5  years of age exposed to  detemir was only 41 the 
data  from  Trial  NN304-1689  and  NN304-1690  support  the  extension  of  the  current  indication  for 
Assessment report  
EMA/903009/2011  
Page 37/38
 
 
 
 
insulin  detemir  to  include  the  use  of  insulin  detemir  in  children  2-5  years.  The  number  was  in 
agreement with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan saying: “In the insulin detemir group, at least 
40 between 2 and 5 years …. at randomisation”. These young children, irrespective of gender, did as 
well  as  the  older  children  ≥  6  years  for  whom  insulin  detemir  was  approved  in  EU  in  2005.  Insulin 
detemir was as safe and efficacious as NPH insulin in treatment of children and adolescents from 2-16 
years  with  diabetes  mellitus.  Children  treated  with  insulin  detemir  had  similar  glycaemic  control,  less 
hypoglycaemia,  few  severe  nocturnal  hypoglycaemia  episodes,  less  weight  gain  and  fewer  serious 
adverse events than children treated with NPH insulin. The longer duration of action, the lower within-
subject variation in fasting blood glucose, the lower risk of hypoglycaemia and the lower body weight 
gain of s.c. insulin detemir compared to NPH insulin may offer advantages for the treatment of young 
children  with  diabetes  mellitus.  The  proposed  indication for  Levemir  use  is  children  aged  2-5  years  is 
therefore considered as approvable. 
3.  Conclusion 
On 21 September 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet. 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  available  paediatric  data  subject  to  the  agreed  Paediatric 
Investigation  Plan  and  the  results  of  these  studies  are  reflected  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate the Package Leaflet. 
In accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation EC(No)1901/2006 as amended, significant studies in the 
agreed paediatric investigation plan have been completed after the entry into force of that Regulation.

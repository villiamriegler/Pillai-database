1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are 
issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD 
is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

This type II variation concerns the addition of new 
Labelling and Package Leaflet 
Labelling and 
contraindications in section 4.3 of the SPC and new 
PL 
information in sections 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.3 of the SPC in 
relation to a dose-related risk of QTc prolongation following 
Page 5/10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposure to Fareston. Further, section 4.5 of the SPC has 
been amended to highlight that Fareston should not be used 
concurrently with other substances that prolong the QT 
interval. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to update the annexes in 
line with the latest QRD template. 
Both in preclinical investigations and in humans, changes in 
cardiac electrophysiology have been observed following 
exposure to Fareston (toremifene), in the form of QT 
prolongation. For reasons of drug safety, toremifene is 
therefore contraindicated in patients with: 
- Congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation 
- Electrolyte disturbances, particularly in uncorrected 
hypokalaemia 
- Clinically relevant bradycardia 
- Clinically relevant heart failure with reduced left-ventricular 
ejection fraction 
- Previous history of symptomatic arrhythmias 
Toremifene should also not be used concurrently with other 
drugs that prolong the QT interval. 
 An additive effect on QT interval prolongation between 
Fareston and the following drugs other medicinal products 
that may prolong the QTc interval cannot be excluded. This 
might lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, 
including torsade de pointes. Therefore co-administration of 
Fareston with any of the following medicinal products is 
contraindicated:  
- antiarrhythmics class IA (e.g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, 
disopyramide) or  
- antiarrhythmics class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, 
Page 6/10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dofetilide, ibutilide),  
- neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, pimozide, sertindole, 
haloperidol, sultopride),  
- certain antimicrobials agents (moxifloxacin, erythromycin 
IV, pentamidine, antimalarials particularly halofantrine),  
- certain antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizol

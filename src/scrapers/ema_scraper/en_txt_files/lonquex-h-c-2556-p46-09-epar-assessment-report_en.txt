1.  Introduction 
On 8th September 2015, the MAH submitted a paediatric study addendum for study XM22-07 for 
Lonquex 6 mg solution for injection (EU/1/13/856/001-002), in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The study addendum was to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, 
tolerability and immunogenicity of a single, subcutaneous dose of 100 μg/kg Lonquex in 21 children 
with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma.  
The submitted study has been completed in accordance with an approved paediatric investigational 
plan (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10-M02; European Commission Decision 6th May 2014). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The active substance of Lonquex (lipegfilgrastim) is a covalent conjugate of filgrastim (recombinant 
methionyl human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, produced in E. coli by recombinant technology) 
with methoxy polyethylene glycol via a carbohydrate linker. 
In order to support the original application for a marketing authorisation, the applicant submitted a 
comparability exercise to pegfilgrastim (Neulasta, Amgen), a long-acting recombinant granulocyte-
colony stimulating factor. 
Lonquex was approved for use in adults on 29th July 2013. 
Lonquex has the following indication: 
Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in 
adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception 
of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
According to the MAH: 
The MAH submitted a paediatric clinical study report addendum in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. The submitted study has been completed in accordance with an 
approved paediatric investigational plan (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10-M02; Commission Decision 6th May 
2014). 
This is a follow up submission to procedure number EMA/H/C/002556/P46/008 where the clinical study 
report for study XM22-07 (based on the end of treatment period) was assessed. Further to the 
outcome of this procedure on 16th February 2015 a Type IB variation (EMEA/H/C/002556/IB/0014) 
was submitted in order to implement agreed wording to include the available paediatric 
pharmacokinetics data from study XM22-07 in the SmPC, approved on 16th June 2015.

The last-patient last-visit of the follow up period for study XM22-07 was 21st April 2015. Consequently 
a separate addendum report which covers the follow up data including the results of immunogenicity 
testing, survival status and G-CSF therapy is now submitted. 
There are no regulatory consequences identified by the MAH as a result of this study and no changes 
to the product information are recommended based on the submitted clinical study report addendum. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Assessor’s comment: As stated by the MAH, study XM22-07 was assessed earlier in 2015 via 
procedure P46/08 (final Rapporteur AR dated 16th February 2015) and subsequent variation IB/14 
(May 2015) to introduce information on the paediatric population. The current report assesses follow-
up data for results of immunogenicity testing, survival status and G-CSF therapy. 
2.2.2.  Clinical study 
Study title: Multicenter, Open-label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, 
Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a Single, Subcutaneous Dose of 100 μg/kg 
Lonquex in 21 Children with Ewing Family of Tumors or Rhabdomyosarcoma. Addendum 01. 
Study code: XM22-07. Addendum 01. 
A phase 1 study 
EudraCT Number: 2011-004742-18 
Follow-up Period Start: 16th May 2014 
Follow-up Period End: 21st April 2015 
Addendum Approval Date: 31st August 2015 
Description 
21 subjects were enrolled. The follow-up period for study XM22-07 was 360 days with visits on days 
180 and 360. Results of survival status and the use of additional granulocyte colony stimulating factor 
(G-CSF) therapies are presented. In addition, immunogenicity testing results of samples collected from 
both the Lonquex treatment period and this follow-up period are described. 
Methods 
Immunogenicity testing. 
Characterisation of the immunogenicity to Lonquex was a secondary objective of the study XM22-07. 
Samples for immunogenicity testing, specifically anti-drug antibody (ADA) were collected during the 
screening period before administration of Lonquex , at the end of study visit (day 21), and during the 
CHMP Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/156885/2018

follow-up period at approximately180 days ±2 weeks (day 180) and 360 days ±2 weeks (day 360) 
after Lonquex administration.  
<Confidental information deleted> 
Anti-drug antibodies were assayed for using electro-chemi-luminescent-bridging immunoassays on a 
platform from Meso Scale Diagnostics. 
A statement on compliance with requirements of GLP is provided. 
The following strategy was used to detect antibodies: 
a. Screening assay: samples are screened for the presence or absence of potential anti-lipegfilgrastim 
antibodies. Screening assay is performed using purified rabbit anti-lipegfilgrastim polyclonal antibodies 
as the positive control reagent from which positive controls at two levels are prepared. Samples with 
the ECL counts above or equal to the screening cut-point will be defined as screened positive, while 
samples with ECL count below the screening cut-point are defined as negative samples. 
b. Confirmatory assay: The specificity of the screened positive samples is confirmed by competition 
using unlabelled lipegfilgrastim. Samples with % inhibitions above or equal to the confirmatory cut-
point are "confirmed positive" and are then subjected to titre determination, binding specificity 
characterization and neutralising antibody (NAb) assays. The samples with % inhibitions that are below 
the confirmatory cut-point are "negative" and will require no further analysis. 
c. Titre Determination: The confirmed positive samples are serially diluted and analysed to determine 
the relative amount of anti-lipegfilgrastim antibodies present. A titre value is reported as the log-
transformed dilution factor interpolated at the titre cut-point. 
d. Characterization assays: The confirmed positive samples are characterized to determine if the anti-
lipegfilgrastim antibodies bind to XM21 (protein moiety of lipegfilgrastim) or cPEG (PEG moiety of 
lipegfilgrastim) via competition with XM21 and cPEG, respectively. Lastly, by competing with the 
product Granocyte (lenograstim, authorised in the UK under PL 12185/0002), the glycosylated G-CSF 
that mimics the native (endogenous) G-CSF, the anti-lipegfilgrastimantibodies are tested for their 
cross-reactivity / binding to the native G-CSF. 
Neutralising Antibody Assays 
This method is a qualitative cell-based assay with an evaluation of NFS-60 cell (mouse myelogenous 
leukaemia cell line adapted to respond to recombinant G-CSF, provided by St. Jude Children’s’ 
Research Hospital, US) proliferation as the functional endpoint.

Cell growth is stimulated at a fixed concentration of inducer (EC50, concentration of a drug that gives 
half-maximal response). The human serum samples are added to the assay medium and antibodies 
with a neutralizing activity will reduce cell proliferation, which is measured with the WST-1 reagent [2-
(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] as a chromogen. Statistically 
determined assay cut-points are used at the screening step to determine positivity. 
The assay initially screens for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against lipegfilgrastim or 
lenograstim. Each human serum samples is assayed under 3 conditions (i.e. in presence of 
lipegfilgrastim, in presence of lenograstim, and no inducer). The screened positive samples undergo a 
mIL-3 (Mouse Interleukin 3) confirmatory test to determine whether the neutralizing activity is G-CSF-
specific.  
• 
• 
• 
To be considered positive for neutralizing antibodies, a sample must neutralize the activity of 
lipegfilgrastimand/or lenograstim (positive screening result), must not induce cell growth in 
absence of inducer, and must not neutralize the activity of mIL-3 (negative confirmatory 
result). 
To be considered negative for neutralizing antibodies, a sample must not neutralize the activity 
of lipegfilgrastimand/or lenograstim (negative screening result) and must not induce cell 
growth in absence of inducer. 
If a sample induces cell growth in absence of inducer then it is considered as having an 
inconclusive result in the NAb assay.

The analysis cascade is presented in the following figure: 
CHMP comment: the assay strategy conforms to Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of 
biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins, EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006, Dec 2007. This is 
acceptable. 
A validation exercise or validation summary was not found in submitted documents. The validation 
exercise is described as ‘on-going’.  
Results 
Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor Use in the Follow-Up Period 
During the follow-up period patients were permitted to receive therapy with additional G-CSFs, at the 
discretion of the investigator during subsequent chemotherapy. Therapy with additional G-CSF 
consisted of filgrastim, lenograstim, and pegfilgrastim. Use of additional G-CSF therapy was reported in 
95.2% and 61.9% of patients at days 180 and 360 of the follow-up period, respectively. Results are 
summarised in the following table:

CHMP comment: no additional comment 
Immunogenicity 
Out of 21 patients enrolled in the study, only 1 patient in the 2 to <6 years group was observed to 
develop treatment-related ADA response. This patient was ADA-positive at day 180 after treatment 
with Lonquex and several doses of commercial filgrastim. ADA titre was low (0.1) and ADA bound to 
PEG moiety, but neither to G-CSF moiety of lipegfilgrastim, nor to the native G-CSF. Moreover, ADA of 
this patient was not neutralizing. 
Four other patients were observed ADA-positive before Lonquex treatment (screening time point), 
probably pre-existing ADA. Among these patients 2 had ADA-positive sample at the screening Time-
point only. ADA in these 2 patients was found to bind to both PEG and G-CSF moieties of 
lipegfilgrastim, and also to the native G-CSF. But these antibodies were not neutralizing. The 
remaining 2 patients (0703-07070301 and 0704-07070402) were observed ADA-positive both before 
and after the treatment (which was at only 1 point after treatment at day 21 for patient 0703- 
07070301 and day 180 for patient 0704-07070402). But ADA titres were reduced post-treatment. ADA 
of these 2 patients at both pre- and post-treatment time points bound to PEG moiety only. Although

they were shown to be neutralizing, none of these patients experienced febrile or severe neutropenia. 
The neutralizing activity at screening did not negatively affect efficacy in these patients. 
Characterization of immunogenicity to Lonquex will be evaluated further in study XM22-08. 
CHMP comment: A validation exercise or validation summary was not found in submitted documents. 
The validation exercise is described as ‘on-going’. The MAH does describe precision and accuracy in 
selected runs yet the tables of results are partially obscured by the company logos. Because of this, 
results on immunogenicity are considered to be ‘of interest’ only. The MAH is advised to submit a 
substantive validation exercise for study XM22-08. 
Survival 
The follow-up period for study XM22-07 was 360 days with visits on days 180 and 360. 
No patient was lost to follow-up during the follow-up period.  
On day 180 of the follow-up period, all patients were reported alive. 
Day 180 – 360: One male patient aged 4 years and receiving chemotherapy for metastatic embryonal 
rhabdomyosarcoma died owing to disease progression on 31 March 2015 before day 360 (he had 
received study drug on 26 April 2014, a narrative is provided). Death was judged by the investigator 
as being related to disease progression and not related to Lonquex. 
CHMP comment: the un-relatedness of the one reported death to study drug is accepted. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Results of follow-up to 360 days of the 21 subjects in study XM22-07 do not give rise to any particular 
concerns over either efficacy or safety of the current product in the population studied. 
The MAH is advised to submit a substantive validation exercise and summary of the antibody assays 
with submission of study XM22-08. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
According to the MAH: 
There are no regulatory consequences identified by the MAH as a result of this study and no changes 
to the product information are recommended based on the submitted clinical study report addendum. 
CHMP comment: it is agreed that no regulatory action or changes to the PI texts are needed.

5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Summary of MAH response 
On 08th September 2015, the MAH submitted a paediatric study addendum for study XM22-07 for 
Lonquex 6 mg solution for injection (EU/1/13/856/001-002), in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended (EMA/H/C/002556/P46/009). The study addendum was to 
assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a 
Single, Subcutaneous Dose of 100 μg/kg Lonquex in 21 children with Ewing family of tumours or 
rhabdomyosarcoma. The submitted study has been completed in accordance with an approved 
paediatric investigational plan (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10-M02; European Commission Decision 6th May 
2014). This was a follow up submission to procedure number EMA/H/C/002556/P46/008 where the 
clinical study report for study XM22-07 (based on the end of treatment period) was assessed. Further 
to the outcome of this procedure, a Type IB variation (EMEA/H/C/002556/IB/0014) was submitted on 
16th February 2015 in order to implement agreed wording to include the available paediatric 
pharmacokinetics data from study XM22-07 in the SmPC, approved on 16th June 2015. 
With the outcome of procedure number EMA/H/C/002556/P46/009 the MAH was advised to submit the 
additional clarification request with submission of study results of study XM22-08. But due to a delay in 
overall recruitment this study is deferred by January 2019. The EMA accepted the modification of the 
deferral (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10-M04; PIP decision P/0261/2017 of 4th September 2017). 
Therefore, the MAH informed PDCO in its Annual Report submitted on 24th July 2017 that the 
outstanding substantive validation exercise and summary of the antibody assays would be submitted 
to PDCO by end of December 2017. 
A follow-up submission in response of the outstanding validation reports and respective amendments 
for ADA assay and NAb assay for paediatric subjects was provided in Module section 5.3.1.4 Reports of 
bioanalytical and analytical methods for human studies. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
With the outcome of the Article 46 procedure EMA/H/C/002556/P46/009, the MAH was advised to 
submit a substantive validation exercise and summary of the antibody assays with submission of study 
XM22-08. However, due to a delay in overall recruitment, completion of this study is deferred until 
January 2019 and a corresponding modification of PIP has been agreed. Therefore, the MAH informed 
the PDCO in its Annual Report submitted on 24th July 2017 that they would provide the outstanding 
substantive validation exercise and summary of the antibody assays by the end of 2017. 
As agreed, in November 2017 the MAH submitted the outstanding validation reports and respective 
amendments for the ECL (screening and confirmatory ADA assay) and the cell based NAb assay for 
paediatric subjects. These comprised of:

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Ebymect 
dapagliflozin / metformin 
On 27 June 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Ebymect. The 
marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is AstraZeneca AB. 
The CHMP adopted a change to the existing indication in type 2 diabetes as follows:2 
“Ebymect is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control: 
• 
• 
• 
in patients inadequately insufficiently controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin 
alone  
in combination with other  glucose-lowering medicinal products, including insulin, for the 
treatment of diabetes in patients inadequately insufficiently controlled with metformin and 
these medicinal products (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations) 
in patients already being treated with the combination of dapagliflozin and metformin as separate 
tablets. 
For study results with respect to combination of therapies, effects on glycaemic control and 
cardiovascular events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing

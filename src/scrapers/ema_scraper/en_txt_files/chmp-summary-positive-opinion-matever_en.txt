Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Matever 
levetiracetam 
On 21 July 2011 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Matever 
250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg film-coated tablets and 100 mg/ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion intended for the treatment of epilepsy. The applicant for this medicinal product is 
Pharmathen S.A. They may request a re-examination of any CHMP opinion, provided they notify the 
European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The active substance of Matever is levetiracetam, an antiepileptic agent (ATC code: N03AX14). 
Levetiracetam is a pyrrolidone derivative chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic active 
substances. The mechanism of action of levetiracetam still remains to be fully elucidated but appears 
to be different from the mechanisms of current antiepileptic medicinal products. In vitro and in vivo 
experiments suggest that levetiracetam does not alter basic cell characteristics and normal 
neurotransmission.  
Matever is a generic of Keppra, which has been authorised in the EU since 29 September 2000. Studies 
have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Matever and its bioequivalence with Keppra. A question-
and-answer document on generic medicines can be found here.  
The approved indication is as follows:  
“Monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in 
patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.  
Levetiracetam is indicated as adjunctive therapy: 
 
in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, 
children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy.  
 
in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile 
Myoclonic Epilepsy.  
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the commission decision, which will normally be issued 
67 days from adoption of the opinion.

Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR), and 
will be available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission. 
The CHMP, on the basis of data submitted, considers there to be a favourable benefit to risk balance 
for Matever and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

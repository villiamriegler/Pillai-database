SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Kyntheum in the approved indication remains favourable 
and therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

Update of section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and 
25/06/2020 
30/09/2020 
SmPC and PL 
After reviewing the available data including case reports 
relevant sections of the PL to reflect a signal of 
anaphylactic reaction detected in the post marketing 
setting. 
Minor updates have also been included throughout 
the product information. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
from post-marketing sources, clinical trials and published 
literature, the MAH identified a signal with one case 
providing evidence for a causal relationship between 
anaphylactic reaction and brodalumab. Considering the 
positive rechallenge and the temporal relationship that 
suggests causality, the MAH included this event as new 
undesirable effect in section 4.8 with a “rare” frequency 
and a warning in section 4.4. In the event of an 
anaphylactic reaction, or any other serious allergic reaction, 
administration of Kyntheum should be discontinued and 
appropriate therapy initiated. 
In addition, other changes to the SmPC were approved 
mainly based on updated safety data of all pooled phase 2 
and 3 clinical trials in the psoriasis development 
programme including a deletion of a warning on reduced 
absolute neutrophil count, changes to frequencies of ADRs 
and minor changes in section 5.1 and 5.2. The Package 
leaflet was updated accordingly

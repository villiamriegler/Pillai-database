1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Carbaglu 200 mg dispersible tablets 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each tablet contains 200 mg of carglumic acid. 
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Dispersible tablet 
The tablets are white and elongated with three score marks and engraved on one side. 
The tablet can be divided into equal doses. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Carbaglu is indicated in treatment of  
•  hyperammonaemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase primary deficiency. 
•  hyperammonaemia due to isovaleric acidaemia. 
•  hyperammonaemia due to methylmalonic acidaemia. 
•  hyperammonaemia due to propionic acidaemia. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Carbaglu treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of metabolic disorders. 
Posology: 
•  For N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency: 
Based on clinical experience, the treatment may be started as early as the first day of life. 
The initial daily dose should be 100 mg/kg, up to 250 mg/kg if necessary. 
It should then be adjusted individually in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels (see 
section 4.4).  
In the long term, it may not be necessary to increase the dose according to body weight as long as 
adequate metabolic control is achieved; daily doses range from 10 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg. 
Carglumic acid responsiveness test 
It is recommended to test individual responsiveness to carglumic acid before initiating any long term 
treatment. As examples  
-  
In a comatose child, start with a dose of 100 to 250 mg/kg/day and measure ammonia plasma 
concentration at least before each administration; it should normalise within a few hours after 
starting Carbaglu. 
In a patient with moderate hyperammonaemia, administer a test dose of 100 to 200 mg/kg/day 
for 3 days with a constant protein intake and perform repeated determinations of ammonia 
plasma concentration (before and 1 hour after a meal); adjust the dose in order to maintain 
normal ammonia plasma levels.

•  For isovaleric acidaemia, methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: 
The treatment should start upon hyperammonaemia in organic acidaemia patients. The initial daily 
dose should be 100 mg/kg, up to 250 mg/kg if necessary. 
It should then be individually adjusted in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels (see 
section 4.4). 
Renal impairment: 
Caution is advised when administering Carbaglu to patients with impaired renal function.  
Dosage adjustment is required according to GFR. 
•  Patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 mL/min) 
o 
o 
the recommended initial dose is 50 mg/kg/day to 125 mg/kg/day for patients 
presenting an hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency or organic acidaemia, 
In the long term use the daily dose will be in the range of 5 mg/kg/day to 50 
mg/kg/day and should be adjusted individually in order to maintain normal ammonia 
plasma levels 
•  Patients with severe renal impairment (GFR ≤ 29 mL/min) 
o 
o 
the recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day for patients presenting 
an hyperammonaemia due to NAGS deficiency or organic acidaemia, 
In the long term use the daily dose will be in the range of 2 mg/kg/day to 20 
mg/kg/day and should be adjusted individually in order to maintain normal ammonia 
plasma levels 
Paediatric population 
The safety and effectiveness of Carbaglu for the treatment of pediatric patients (birth to 17 years of 
age) with acute or chronic hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency and acute hyperammonemia 
due to IVA, PA or MMA have been established, and based on these data, posology adjustments in 
neonates are not deemed necessary.  
Method of administration: 
This medicine is for oral use ONLY (ingestion or via a nasogastric tube using a syringe, if necessary). 
Based on pharmacokinetic data and clinical experience, it is recommended to divide the total daily 
dose into two to four doses to be given before meals or feedings. The breaking of the tablets in halves 
allows most of the required posology adjustments. Occasionally, the use of quarter tablets may also be 
useful to adjust the posology prescribed by the physician. 
The tablets must be dispersed in a minimum of 5-10 ml of water and ingested immediately or 
administered by fast push through a syringe via a nasogastric tube. 
The suspension has a slightly acidic taste. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 . 
Breast-feeding during the use of carglumic acid is contraindicated (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Therapeutic monitoring 
Plasma levels of ammonia and amino acids should be maintained within normal limits. 
As very few data on the safety of carglumic acid are available, systematic surveillance of liver, renal, 
cardiac functions and haematological parameters is recommended. 
Nutritional management 
Protein restriction and arginine supplementation may be indicated in case of low protein tolerance.

Use in patients with renal impairment 
The dose of Carbaglu must be reduced in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2) 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No specific interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
For carglumic acid no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. 
Animal studies have revealed minimal developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Caution should be 
exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.  
Breast-feeding  
Although it is not known whether carglumic acid is secreted into human milk, it has been shown to be 
present in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). Therefore, breast-feeding during the use of 
carglumic acid is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

professionals  are  asked  to  report  any  suspected  adverse  reactions  via  the  national  reporting  system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In one patient treated with carglumic acid, where the dose was increased up to 750 mg/kg/day, 
symptoms of intoxication occurred which can be characterised as a sympathomimetic reaction: 
tachycardia, profuse sweating, increased bronchial secretion, increased body temperature and 
restlessness. These symptoms resolved once the dose was reduced.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Amino acids and derivatives; ATC code: A16AA05 
Mechanism of action 
Carglumic acid is a structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate, which is the naturally occurring 
activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, the first enzyme of the urea cycle. 
Carglumic acid has been shown in vitro to activate liver carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Despite a 
lower affinity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase for carglumic acid than for N-acetylglutamate, 
carglumic acid has been shown in vivo to stimulate carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and to be much 
more effective than N-acetylglutamate in protecting against ammonia intoxication in rats. This could 
be explained by the following observations: 
i) The mitochondrial membrane is more readily permeable for carglumic acid than for N-
acetylglutamate 
ii) Carglumic acid is more resistant than N-acetylglutamate to hydrolysis by aminoacylase present in 
the cytosol. 
Pharmacodynamic effects  
Other studies have been conducted in rats under different experimental conditions leading to 
increased ammonia availability (starvation, protein-free or high-protein diet). Carglumic acid was 
shown to decrease blood ammonia levels and increase urea levels in blood and urine, whereas the 
liver content of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase activators was significantly increased. 
Clinical efficacy and safety  
In patients with N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency, carglumic acid was shown to induce a rapid 
normalisation of plasma ammonia levels, usually within 24 hours. When the treatment was instituted 
before any permanent brain damage, patients exhibited normal growth and psychomotor development. 
In patients with organic acidaemia (neonates and non-neonates), the treatment with carglumic acid 
induced a quick decrease of ammonia plasma levels, reducing the risk of neurological complications. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid has been studied in healthy male volunteers using both 
radiolabelled and unlabelled product. 
Absorption 
After a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, approximately 30% of carglumic acid is estimated 
to be absorbed. At that dose-level, in 12 volunteers given Carbaglu tablets, plasma concentration 
peaked at 2.6 µg/ml (median; range 1.8-4.8) after 3 hours (median; range 2-4). 
Distribution 
The plasma elimination curve of carglumic acid is biphasic with a rapid phase over the first 12 hours 
after administration followed by a slow phase (terminal half life up to 28 hours). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Diffusion into erythrocytes is non existent. Protein binding has not been determined. 
Biotransformation 
A proportion of carglumic acid is metabolised. It is suggested that depending on its activity, the 
intestinal bacterial flora may contribute to the initiation of the degradation process, thus leading to a 
variable extent of metabolism of the molecule. One metabolite that has been identified in the faeces is 
glutamic acid. Metabolites are detectable in plasma with a peak at 36-48 hours and a very slow 
decline (half-life around 100 hours). 
The end product of carglumic acid metabolism is carbon dioxide, which is eliminated through the 
lungs. 
Elimination 
After a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, 9% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine 
and up to 60% in the faeces. 
Plasma levels of carglumic acid were measured in patients of all age categories, from newborn infants 
to adolescents, treated with various daily doses (7 – 122 mg/kg/day). Their range was consistent with 
those measured in healthy adults, even in newborn infants. Whatever the daily dose, they were slowly 
declining over 15 hours to levels around 100 ng/ml. 
Special Populations 
Patients with Renal Impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in subjects with renal impairment were compared with 
subjects with normal renal function following oral administration of a single dose of Carbaglu 40 
mg/kg or 80 mg/kg. The Cmax and AUC0-T of carglumic acid are summarized in the table below. The 
geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC0-T in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal 
impairment relative to those in their matched control subjects with normal renal function were 
approximately 1.8 (1.34, 2.47), 2.8 (2.17, 3.65), and 6.9 (4.79, 9.96), respectively. Renal clearance 
(CLr) decreased by 0.79-, 0.53-, and 0.15-fold in mild, moderate and severe renal impaired subjects, 
respectively, when compared to subjects with normal renal function. It is considered that the PK 
changes of carglumic acid accompanied with impaired renal function are clinically relevant, and 
dosage adjustment on the dose would be warranted in moderate and severe renal impaired subjects 
[see Posology and method of administration (4.2)].

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Safety pharmacology studies have shown that Carbaglu administered orally at doses of 250, 500, 
1000 mg/kg had no statistically significant effect on respiration, central nervous system and 
cardiovascular system. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carbaglu showed no significant mutagenic activity in a battery of genotoxicity tests performed in 
vitro (Ames test, human lymphocyte metaphase analysis) and in vivo (micronucleus test in rat). 
Single doses of carglumic acid up to 2800 mg/kg orally and 239 mg/kg intravenously did not induce 
any mortality or abnormal clinical signs in adult rats. In newborn rats receiving daily carglumic acid 
by oral gavage for 18 days as well as in young rats receiving daily carglumic acid for 26 weeks, the 
No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was established at 500 mg/kg/day and the No Observed Adverse 
Effect Level (NOAEL) was established at 1000 mg/kg/day. 
No adverse effects have been observed on male or female fertility. In rats and rabbits no evidence has 
been seen of embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity up to maternotoxic doses leading to fifty 
times exposure as compared to humans in rats and seven times in rabbits. Carglumic acid is secreted 
in the milk of lactating rats and although developmental parameters were unaffected, there were some 
effects on body weight / body weight gain of pups breast-fed by dams treated with 500 mg/kg/day and 
a higher mortality of pups from dams treated with 2000 mg/kg/day, a dose that caused 
maternotoxicity. The maternal systemic exposures after 500 and 2000 mg/kg/day were twenty five 
times and seventy times the expected human exposure. 
No carcinogenicity study has been conducted with carglumic acid.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Carbaglu is and what it is used for 
Carbaglu can help eliminating excessive ammonia plasma levels (elevated ammonia level in the 
blood). Ammonia is especially toxic for the brain and leads, in severe cases, to reduced levels of 
consciousness and to coma. 
Hyperammonaemia may be  due to 
• the lack of a specific liver enzyme N- acetylglutamate synthase. Patients with this rare disorder 
are not able to eliminate nitrogen waste, which builds up after eating protein. 
This disorder persists during the entire life of the affected patient and therefore the need for this 
treatment is lifelong. 
• isovaleric acidaemia, methylmalonic acidaemia or propionic acidaemia. Patients suffering from 
one of these disorders need treatment during the hyperammonaemia crisis. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Carbaglu 
Do not take Carbaglu 
if you are allergic to carglumic acid or any of the other ingredients of Carbaglu (listed in section 6). 
Do not take Carbaglu during breast-feeding 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Carbaglu.  
Carbaglu treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of metabolic disorders. 
Your doctor will evaluate your individual responsiveness to carglumic acid before initiating any long 
term treatment.  
The dose should be individually adjusted in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels. 
Your doctor may prescribe supplemental arginine or restrict your protein intake. 
In order to follow-up your condition and your treatment, your doctor may examine your liver, your 
kidneys, your heart and your blood on a regular basis.

Carbaglu with food and drink 
Carbaglu must be taken orally before meals or feedings. 
The tablets must be dispersed in a minimum of 5 to 10 ml of water and taken immediately. The

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
The excretion of carglumic acid into breast milk has not been studied in women. Nevertheless, as 
carglumic acid has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats with potential toxic effects 
for their fed pups, you should not breast feed your baby if you are taking Carbaglu.

your blood.

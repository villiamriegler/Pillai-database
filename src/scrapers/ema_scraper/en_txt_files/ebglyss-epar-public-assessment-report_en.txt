2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Problem statement  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition  
Atopic dermatitis (AD)  is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder characterised by erythematous, 
pruritic, dry, scaly and often lichenified skin. Pruritus is a hallmark of AD and is responsible for much  of 
the  disease burden for patients  and their  families. Moderate to severe AD  is associated with  significant 
burden, impacting sleep, quality of life, and treatment needs.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
AD  is  the  most  common  chronic  inflammatory  skin  disease  that  is  often  diagnosed  in  early  years in 
children, but it  may also affect patients in their adult life. Global AD  prevalence is increasing in all ages: 
in children up to  20% 1 , while in adults  and elderly up to 10%  1, 2, 3. In adolescents (≥12 to  <18 years),

this prevalence is up to 16% worldwide 4. Among patients with AD in the EU, the proportion with moderate 
to severe disease varies from 46% to 66% depending on the patient-reported measurement scale used2.  
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis  
AD  is a complex disease with  an interplay between  abnormal immune  response, genetic impairment  of 
skin barrier and environmental factors 5. The immune response in AD is skewed towards T helper 2 (Th2) 
cell-mediated pathways 6. IL-13  is believed to be the central mediator that  drives multiple aspects of the 
pathophysiology underlying the range of signs  and symptoms of AD  by promoting type  2 inflammation 
and  mediating  its  effects  on  tissue,  resulting  in  skin  barrier  dysfunction,  itch,  skin  thickening,  and 
propensity to infections 7. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation  
AD is characterised by xerosis, erythematous crusted eruption (dermatosis), lichenification,  and intense 
pruritus 8,  which  along  with  the  distribution,  chronicity,  and  history  of  skin  lesions,  form  the  basis  for 
making the diagnosis. The clinical phenotype can vary depending on the age. In adolescents and adults 
(12-60  years),  eczematous  lesions  prevalently  affect  head,  neck  and  flexural  areas,  with  xerosis, 
lichenification, and depigmentation 9.  
2.1.5.  Management  
The goals of AD  therapy are to  reduce pruritus and establish persistent disease control that is sufficient 
to  enable  patients  to  be  fully  functional  at  home,  work  and  school.  These  goals  typically  require  a 
multistep  approach with  interventions  that  are aimed at  avoiding relevant triggers,  improving the  skin 
barrier, normalizing the skin dysbiosis and reducing inflammation 10.  
Topical  therapies,  e.g.  moisturisers  are  the  mainstay  of  therapy  for  patients  with  mild-to-moderate 
disease. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are used as the first-line anti-inflammatory treatment and reduce 
disease recurrence when  used intermittently.  Use of low-potency TCS bears low risk, but  inappropriate 
use  of  high-potency  TCS  can  cause  local  side  effect  such  as  skin  thinning,  purpura,  striae  and 
dyspigmentation10. 
Topical  calcineurin 
inhibitors 
(TCIs) 
tacrolimus  and  pimecrolimus  are  alternative 
topical 
immunomodulators  for  the  treatment  of  AD.  Currently  per  EMA  recommendations,  these  medicines 
should  be only  used in  patients  over the  age of 2  years with  mild  or moderate disease (in  the  case of 
pimecrolimus) and moderate to severe disease (in the case of tacrolimus), when treatment with topical 
corticosteroids should not or cannot be used 11.  
Other  treatment  options  include  short-term  phototherapy  if  disease cannot  be  controlled  with  topical 
therapies and oral glucocorticoids. Systemic non-biologic immunomodulatory therapies, e.g. ciclosporin, 
azathioprine,  methotrexate  and  mycophenolate mofetil  are also  used10.  Other  treatments  options  for

moderate-to-severe AD include oral JAK inhibitors abrocitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib. However, the use 
of JAK inhibitors  has been associated with  some serious side effects and should be used with caution 12.  
Two biological therapies have been approved by EMA for moderate-to-severe disease: dupilumab in 2017 
and tralokinumab in 2021.  Dupilumab  is a mAb against IL-4Rα that  inhibits  IL-4  signalling via the Type 
I  receptor (IL-4Rα/γc),  and  both  IL-4  and  IL-13  signalling  through  the  Type  II  receptor  (IL-4Rα/IL-
13Rα) 13. Tralokinumab is a mAb against IL-13 that neutralises the biological activity of IL-13 by blocking 
its interaction  with the  IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα receptor complex 14.  
2.2.  About the product  
Lebrikizumab is  an immunoglobin  G4 (IgG4)  monoclonal antibody  (mAb)  that  binds  with  high  affinity 
to  soluble  interleukin  IL-13  and  inhibits  IL-13  signalling  through  the  IL-4  receptor  alpha 
(IL-4Rα)/IL-13  receptor alpha 1 (IL-13Rα1) pathway, thereby preventing the downstream effects of IL-
13  with  high selectivity. It blocks the  binding of IL-13  to IL-4Rα,  but  does not  block the  binding  of IL-
13 to IL-13Rα1  or IL-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13Rα2). 
ATC-code has not yet been assigned. 
The proposed indication  for  lebrikizumab is as  follows: “Lebrikizumab  is indicated  for the  treatment  of 
moderate-to-severe atopic  dermatitis  in  adults  and  adolescents  12  years  of  age  and  older  who  are 
candidates  for  systemic  therapy”.  The  summary  of  product  characteristic  (SmPC)  also  states  that 
lebrikizumab can  be  used with  or  without  topical  corticosteroids (TCS)  or topical  calcineurin  inhibitors 
(TCI). 
The proposed dose of  lebrikizumab is an  initial  dose of 500  mg (two  250  mg injections)  at week 0 and 
week 2,  followed by 250  mg every other  week administered as subcutaneous injection  up to  week 16. 
The recommended maintenance dose is 250 mg every fourth week.  
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development  
The application was submitted under the legal basis 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC which  corresponds to 
a complete and independent application.  
The applicant received EMA scientific advice on the preclinical and clinical development programme of 
lebrikizumab in the treatment of AD (see section 1.6. ‘Scientific advice’).

2.4.  Quality aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction  
Lebrikizumab, the active substance contained in Ebglyss, is a monoclonal antibody (MAb) based on a 
human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) framework, produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by 
recombinant DNA technology. 
Ebglyss is presented as a 250 mg/2 mL sterile solution for injection for subcutaneous administration at 
a concentration of 125 mg/mL. As described in section 6.5 of the SmPC there are two presentations:  
•  2 mL solution  in a 2.25 mL Type-1 clear glass pre-filled syringe with small round flange, with a 
27 gauge special thin wall x 12.7 mm stacked stainless steel needle, closed with a laminated 
bromobutyl elastomeric plunger and a rigid needle shield and assembled in a passive safety 
device (further named ‘PFS-NSD’) 
•  2 mL solution  in a 2.25  mL Type-1 clear glass syringe in a pre-filled pen with extra-small round 
flange, with a 27 gauge special thin wall x 8 mm stacked stainless steel needle, and closed 
with  a laminated bromobutyl elastomeric plunger and a rigid needle shield (further named 
‘autoinjector-pre-filled pen’ or ‘AI-PFP’). 
Other ingredients are histidine, glacial acetic acid, sucrose, polysorbate 20, water for injections.  
2.4.2.  Active Substance  
2.4.2.1.  General  information  
Lebrikizumab is a monoclonal antibody (MAb)  based on a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) framework 
containing  light  chain VL κ IV and heavy chain VHII subgroup sequences. The recombinant antibody is 
produced  in  Chinese  Hamster  Ovary (CHO)  cells  and  consists  of  two  heavy  chains  (445  amino  acid 
residues each) and  two  light  chains (218  amino acid  residues each) with  a relative molecular mass  of 
approximately 145 kDa. 
Mechanism  of  action  is  binding  with  high  affinity  to  interleukin  (IL)-13  and  inhibiting  IL-13  signalling 
through  the IL-4  receptor alpha (IL-4Rα)/IL-13  receptor alpha 1  (IL-13Rα1)  pathway, thereby blocking 
the  downstream effects of IL-13  with  high  selectivity. Blockade of IL-13  signalling  is expected to be  of 
benefit  in diseases in which  IL-13  is  a key contributor  to  the disease pathogenesis. Lebrikizumab does 
not prevent the binding of IL-13 to the IL-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13Rα2 or decoy receptor), which allows 
the internalisation of IL-13  into the cell. 
An N-linked  glycosylation site  is present on  Asn295 in  each heavy chain.  The predominant  form of the 
fucosylated N-linked oligosaccharide of lebrikizumab is G0 (i.e. . 0 terminal galactose residues).  
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture,  characterisation  and process  controls  
The  active  substance  is  manufactured  at  Samsung  Biologics  Co.,  Ltd.  (SBL),  300  Songdo-bio-daero, 
Yeonsu-gu, Incheon 21987,  Republic  of Korea.   It was confirmed that the  site  involved in  manufacture 
and quality control of the active substance operate in accordance with EU GMP.

Description  of manufacturing  process and  process controls 
The manufacturing process is based on a commonly used monoclonal production  technology. Upstream 
process  consists  of  several  cell  expansion  steps  and  a  harvest  step.  In  the  downstream  process the 
harvested cell culture is purified using a series of purification and formulation steps. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient  information  on  raw  materials used  in  the  active substance  manufacturing  process has  been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while 
specifications (including  test  methods)  for non-compendial  raw materials are  presented. No  human  or 
animal  derived  materials  are  used  in  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  and  acceptable 
documents  have been  provided for raw  materials of  biological  origin  used in  the  establishment  of  cell 
substrate. 
The source and history of the CHO cell line used for active substance expression is stated. The expression 
construct  is  described  in  adequate  detail.  The  applicant  provided  information  on  the  process  on  the 
single-cell selection process of monoclonality. A two-tier cell bank system of master cell bank (MCB) and 
working cell bank (WCB) is  used. Based to  the  provided results, the  genetic stability for MCB and  WCB 
is demonstrated for cells at and beyond the limit  of cell age. Sufficient information is provided regarding 
testing  of MCB and WCB and release of future WCBs. 
An overview of the  raw materials  used in  the  manufacture of the  active substance  has been provided, 
with  listing per unit  operation. Specifications of raw materials have been also provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A  comprehensive  overview  of  critical  in-process  controls  and  critical  in-process  tests  performed 
throughout  the  lebrikizumab active  substance  manufacturing  process is  given. Acceptable information 
has  been  provided  on  the  control  system  in  place  to  monitor  and  control  the  active  substance 
manufacturing process. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. 
The  lebrikizumab  active  substance  manufacturing  process  does  not  produce  isolated  process 
intermediates for long-term storage. Each of the process intermediates are subject to short-term storage 
and have been evaluated for both physicochemical stability and microbiological control.  
The microbiological testing strategy, consisting of bioburden and endotoxins testing, sufficiently supports 
the manufacturing process and hold times.  
Process validation 
The  lebrikizumab active  substance manufacturing  process has been  validated adequately. Consistency 
in  production  has  been  shown  on  three  full  scale commercial  batches.  All  acceptance  criteria  for  the 
critical  operational  parameters  and  likewise  acceptance  criteria  for  the  in-process  tests  are  fulfilled 
demonstrating  that  the  manufacturing  process consistently  produces lebrikizumab  active substance  of 
reproducible  quality  that  complies  with  the  predetermined  specification  and  in-process  acceptance 
criteria. Shipping  qualification  studies were completed to  verify that  the  lebrikizumab active substance 
can be transported from the  active substance manufacturing site to  the finished product manufacturing 
site, with  no adverse impact on the product. 
An  extractable  and  leachable  risk  assessment  regarding  all  contact  materials  used  during  the 
manufacturing process of active substance was provided. 
Manufacturing process development 
In course of development, changes were introduced to the active substance manufacturing process. The 
Applicant  provided  comparability studies  which  showed  similarity  between  the  material  manufactured 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023

across the  used processes. CQA-based risk assessment was performed in order to establish the control 
strategy.  Multiple  studies  were  performed  to  understand  the  relationship  between  CQAs  and  the 
manufacturing  process. Results  of process characterisation and  risk assessment studies were provided 
for each manufacturing step.  
Characterisation 
Characterisation  results  include  determination  of  structure  (primary,  secondary,  and  higher-order 
structure),  oligosaccharide  structure  (glycosylation  site,  oligosaccharide  profiling  and  structural 
identification,  sialic acid content), sulfhydryl groups and disulfide structure, isoform pattern and charge 
variants, isoelectric point, extinction coefficient, electrophoretic patterns, size variants, thermal stability, 
biological mechanism and immunological characterisation.  
The  primary structure of  lebrikizumab including  intact  antibody  and  light  and  heavy chain structure  is 
considered adequately determined using several techniques and confirm the expected sequence.  
Various techniques were used to determine the N- and C-terminal sequences of the LC and HC. 
The oligosaccharide structure was studied and the oligosaccharide profiling was considered sufficient. 
Charge and  size variants  were  analysed with  variety of  techniques  and  considered  sufficient  to  cover 
different forms of charged and size variant versions.  
Biological  activity  is  characterised and  controlled  by  a  cell-based assay which  measures the  ability  of 
lebrikizumab to bind to IL-13. 
Fc effector functions studied demonstrated that no Fcγ receptor binding or C1q binding is detected. Thus, 
no ADCC or CDC activity is expected.  
Product-related  impurities/substances  as  well  as  process-related  impurities  have  been  identified. 
Impurities are characterised at sufficient level.  
Control of mycoplasma and adventitious viruses are assessed. 
Overall, the performed characterisation studies  including  identification  of the  impurities  are considered 
relevant and cover a wide variety of physicochemical and biological characterisation studies.  
2.4.2.3.  Specification

Ebglyss,  or  lebrikizumab  injection,  250 mg/2 mL,  is  supplied  as  a  sterile,  non-pyrogenic  parenteral 
solution  for subcutaneous  administration. The finished  product is  contained  in  a 2.25 mL,  Type I  glass 
syringe barrel with a laminated bromobutyl elastomeric plunger. The container closure system filled with 
product is referred to as the semi-finished syringe (SFS). The SFS is assembled with device components 
to  form one of  two  integral  medicinal products,  that  is,  either the  pre-filled  syringe with  needle safety 
device (PFS-NSD)  or  the  autoinjector  pre-filled  pen  (AI-PFP)  presentation.  The  PFS-NSD  is  a  needle-
based injection system that  enables the user to manually insert the needle and deliver the lebrikizumab 
finished  product.  The  AI-PFP  is  a  needle-based  injection  system  that,  when  activated,  automatically 
inserts the needle and delivers the lebrikizumab finished product.  
All excipients (histidine, glacial acetic acid, sucrose, polysorbate 20, water for injections) are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. Standards. Excess volume is filled 
into  each  syringe to  enable  delivery of  2  mL  in  compliance  with  United  States  Pharmacopoeia (USP) 
general chapter <1151> pharmaceutical dosage forms.  
The primary packaging is a 2.25 mL Type-1 clear glass pre-filled syringe with  small round flange, with a 
27 gauge special thin wall x 12.7 mm stacked stainless steel needle, closed with a laminated bromobutyl 
elastomeric plunger and a rigid needle shield, to be assembled in a passive safety device, or a 2.25 mL 
Type-1  clear  glass  syringe  in  an  autoinjector  pre-filled  pen  with  extra-small round  flange,  with  a  27 
gauge special thin  wall  x 8 mm stacked stainless steel needle, and closed with  a laminated  bromobutyl 
elastomeric plunger and a rigid needle shield.

requirements of the standard International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 11040-4: 2015, 
Prefilled syringes - Part 4: Glass Barrels for Injectables. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
The finished presentations are medicinal products where the device part and the medicinal product form 
an integral product that is not  reusable and where the action of the medicinal product is principal. 
The SFS for PFS-NSD  is assembled with commercially available syringe accessories to form the prefilled 
syringe with needle safety device (PFS-NSD).  
The  container  closure  studies  have  included  analyses of  extractables  and  leachables,  photostability, 
safety, compatibility and performance. The applicant provided a Notified Body Opinion for the PFS-NSD 
container closure and delivery device, in  accordance with  Article 117  of the  Medical Device Regulation, 
confirming full compliance with the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs).  
The  SFS  for  AI-PFP  is  assembled with  components  and  subassemblies  to  form  an  autoinjector  (also 
referred to as Pre-filled Pen). The autoinjector is a needle-based injection system (NIS) with automated 
functions.  During  the  procedure, the  applicant  provided  a  Notified  Body Opinion  for  the  autoinjector 
container closure and  delivery device, in  accordance with  Article  117  of the  Medical  Device Regulation 
confirming full compliance with the relevant GSPRs, this to respond to a major objection (MO).   
Both  presentations  (PFS-NSD  and  AI-PFP)  are  supported  by  extensive  studies  for  protection,  light 
exposure,  integrity  and  safety  of  container  closure  system  materials,  sterilisation,  extractables  and 
leachable  studies,  compatibility,  biocompatibility,  usability,  stability,  needle  and  needle  shield 
performance and shipping/transportation studies. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  selected 
formulation is further supported by formulation development studies.  
Sufficient  process  characterisation  studies  were  performed  for  each  unit  operations  to  assess  the 
robustness of the finished product manufacturing process conducted at laboratory, pilot and commercial 
scales.  
Compatibility  of lebrikizumab bulk product  with  the  SFS for PFS-NSD  and the  SFS for AI-PFP  has been 
demonstrated. Stability studies have been conducted to  demonstrate product  compatibility. A microbial 
hold  time  challenge  study  has  been  performed  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  hold  times  on  microbial 
properties during active substance thaw and compounding. The provided data show that the hold times 
used for the proposed commercial process have no impact on microbial growth. 
Based  on  the  provided data  the  manufacturing  process development  is  considered appropriately and 
sufficiently described. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture  of the product  and process controls  
Lebrikizumab product in SFS is manufactured and further assembled to PFS-NSD and AI-PFP. 
Industrias  Farmacéuticas  Almirall,  S.A.  Barcelona,  Spain,  is  responsible  for  final  EU  release.  It  was 
confirmed that  all  sites  involved in  manufacture and  quality  control  of  the  finished  product  operate in

provided test results confirm the absence of adventitious agents in the cell banks. Viral clearance studies 
were performed using qualified scale-down models. The overall combined log10 reduction values for the 
orthogonal  reduction  unit  operations  can  be  considered  satisfactory.  The applicant’s  assessment and 
conclusion  with  regard  to  viral  safety  can  be  endorsed.  No  material  of  animal  origin  is  used  in  the 
lebrikizumab  manufacturing  process and  based on  the  provided data  the  TSE  risk  can  be  considered 
negligible. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product  has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn  lead to the  conclusion that  the 
product  should  have a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance in  clinical  use.  During  the  procedure, in 
response to  a  Major Objection,  the  applicant  provided the  notified  body  opinion  for the  AI-PFP,  which 
confirms full  compliance with  the  relevant GSPRs in  Annex I of  Regulation (EU)  2017/745.  Overall, the 
active  substance  has  been  extensively characterised using  state-of-art  techniques.  The  set  of  quality 
attributes  tested at  release and at  shelf-life can be considered acceptable. The risk assessment related 
to the exposure of active substance to the light during its processing, storage, and shipping was included 
in the dossier.  
At  the  time  of the  CHMP  opinion,  there  was a minor  unresolved quality  issue  having no  impact on  the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of  the  product, which  pertains  to  the need  to provide results  of leachable studies on 
polymeric container at  the end of the shelf-life of the  active substance when available. This point is put 
forward and agreed as recommendation for future quality development.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality  of this  product is considered to be  acceptable when  used in accordance with  the  conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP  recommends the following point for investigation:  
The applicant is recommended to provide results of leachables studies on the polymeric container at the 
end of the shelf-life of the active substance (24 months at NMT -65°C) to support the final conclusion on 
leachables characterisation.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects  
2.5.1.  Introduction  
The  non-clinical  programme  for  lebrikizumab  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines 
S6(R1) and M3(R2).  The pharmacology programme consisted of in vitro  binding characterisation for IL-
13, and its blockade of receptor formation and signalling, and in vivo  study in airway inflammation model. 
No non-clinical efficacy studies were conducted in non-human primates (NHP),  as sole pharmacologically 
relevant  species.  Safety  pharmacology  endpoints  were  evaluated  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic (TK) program consisted of assessments of lebrikizumab following 
single intravenous (IV) and SC dosing in cynomolgus monkeys and assessment of formation of anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA; anti-lebrikizumab antibodies). Toxicology program consisted of single and repeat-dose 
toxicity studies, fertility and embryofetal (EFD) development and pre- and postnatal development (PPND) 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys and ex vivo  tissue cross-reactivity studies using cynomolgus monkey or 
human tissues. Carcinogenicity risk assessment was done by weight of evidence approach and no studies 
were conducted. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology  
2.5.2.1.  Primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  
The  primary  pharmacodynamic studies  focused  on  in  vitro  IL-13  binding,  specificity  and  inhibition  of 
IL-13 -mediated signalling. 
Lebrikizumab is  an  IgG4  isotype mAb  with  modified  Fc-region,  which  binds  to  human  IL-13  with  high 
affinity (31  pM) and neutralises the activity of IL-13.  In addition to  human IL-13,  lebrikizumab binds to 
cynomolgus monkey IL-13 (with KD <0.67 pM), thus leaving NHPs as the sole pharmacologically relevant 
species. The accurate lebrikizumab binding affinity for cynomolgus monkey IL-13 could not be calculated 
due to slow off-rates being below the detection limits.  
Lebrikizumab blocks the  binding  of IL-13  to  IL-4Rα preventing heterodimerisation of  IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα, 
and thus  inhibits the IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα STAT-dependent signalling pathway. Lebrikizumab does not block 
the binding  of IL-13 to IL-13Rα1 or IL-13Rα2.  
Lebrikizumab  inhibits  IL-13-induced  phosphorylation  of  STAT6,  the  primary  downstream  signalling 
mediator of the  IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα receptor complex. Lebrikizumab inhibits  IL-13-induced proliferation of 
Hodgkin lymphoma L-1236 and HDLM-2  cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.  
Lebrikizumab is a IgG4 Mab with modified Fc, which  has moderate binding affinity to FcγRI, low binding 
ability to FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIa and to C1q, and thus has a low effector function potential.  
In  an in  vivo  C57BL/6  mouse  airway inflammation  model, lebrikizumab reduced human  IL-13-induced 
inflammatory reactions; reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells, eosinophils, IL-13Rα2 expression in 
the lung and TGF-  β1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.  
Serum  IgE  levels  were  measured retrospectively on  the  serum  samples  collected  in  toxicology  study 
from healthy  female cynomolgus monkeys dosed weekly with  0.05,  1 or 25  mg/kg lebrikizumab IV for 
9-months  (followed  by  8-month  recovery period).  All  animals  had  detectable  IgE  serum  levels  at  all 
timepoints,  but  levels  of  IgE  were  variable  between  animals.  In  lebrikizumab-treated  animals, 
approximately 25%−40%  reduction of baseline corrected serum IgE levels were recorded. Maximum IgE 
reduction of 40% from pre-dose baseline levels was observed in the 25 mg/kg dose group on Day 29. 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 20/209 
 
 
 
Collectively, the  pharmacology data  support  that  lebrikizumab is  selective  for  IL-13,  to  which  it  binds 
with  high  affinity  to  block the formation  of the  IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα  receptor complex and  thereby inhibits 
IL-13-induced phosphorylation of STAT6 and downstream signalling. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted.  
2.5.2.3.  Safety  pharmacology  programme   
Safety  pharmacology  endpoints  were  incorporated  within  general  repeat-dose  toxicity  and  pre-  and 
postnatal development and fertility studies of lebrikizumab in cynomolgus monkeys. Measurements were 
performed in  compliance with  ICH  S6(R1) and  S7A guidelines and  according to GLP  regulations. There 
were  no  indications  of  cardiovascular,  respiratory,  and  central  nervous  system  effects  attributed  to 
lebrikizumab in the toxicity studies. In addition, in vitro  hERG ion channel current study was conducted, 
in which  lebrikizumab induced no hERG inhibition at up to maximum concentration 6.0 mg/mL. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic  drug interactions   
No secondary pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
The single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of lebrikizumab was evaluated in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, 
and  the  repeat-dose  toxicokinetics  (TK)  of  lebrikizumab  was  evaluated  in  monkeys.  In  rats,  PK 
parameters were evaluated after  single SC administration  of  lebrikizumab derived from either  Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO)  or murine myeloma (NS0)  cells lines, and in  cynomolgus monkeys after singe IV 
or repeated SC administration. TK was evaluated in monkeys as part of the repeat-dose toxicity studies 
after either IV or SC administration. 
Methods of analysis 
For  the  quantification  of  free  lebrikizumab  (TNX-650)  or  anti-TNX-650  antibodies  in  the  cynomolgus 
monkey serum, an ELISA was used. The validation reports demonstrate that  the assays were sensitive, 
selective and suitable for assessing the selected endpoints.  
For assays S-1040 and S-1042, the FDA  assay criteria were used. EU acceptance criteria (<15% or 20%) 
are stricter  than the  FDA  criteria (<25%).  Therefore, the EU  criteria are not  necessarily met. However, 
this is not  considered as an issue in this data set.  
Absorption 
Single-dose  PK  studies  were  performed  in  male  Sprague  Dawley  rats  with  5 mg/kg  SC  dose  of 
lebrikizumab and  in  cynomolgus monkeys with  1,  10  and  100  mg/kg IV  dose of  lebrikizumab. After a 
single IV administration, the Cmax increased in a dose-proportional manner over the 100-fold dose range. 
The AUC0-inf was dose proportional over the 1 to 10 mg/kg dose levels but less than  dose proportional at 
the  100 mg/kg.  Clearance  rates  and  volume  of  distribution  were  low  (2.12  to  4.93  mL/day/kg  and 
59.0-85.0,  respectively) and T1/2 9-25 days. 
Repeat-dose TK  studies were performed in male and  female cynomolgus monkeys (weekly IV bolus  or 
SC  administration).  The  serum concentrations  of  lebrikizumab were  analysed in  the  6-week,  13-week 
and  9-month  general  toxicity  studies  and  the  serum  peak  concentrations  and  AUC  values  from  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 21/209 
 
 
 
13-week male fertility  and  9-month  female fertility  studies. The  dose levels 0.95  – 25  mg/kg bw  were 
used in IV studies and 5-25  mg/kg in SC studies. With  once weekly IV dosing, serum concentrations of 
lebrikizumab  were  dose-proportional  and  accumulation  was  low  to  moderate  (about  4-fold).  The 
clearance rates and volume of distribution  were similar to the values collected from single-dose toxicity 
study. No  sex differences were recorded. The TK data collected after SC administration was in line with 
the IV administration  data. In the  repeat-dose IV studies, treatment-emergent ADA were demonstrated 
in 2  monkeys (one at  1 mg/kg and one at 5 mg/kg dosing), and  these animals were excluded from the 
analysis. 
The  TK  data  collected  from  IV  administration  DART-study  with  cynomolgus  monkeys  showed 
approximately  1.5-fold  accumulation  of  lebrikizumab  after  repeated  administration  and  T1/2  of 
approximately 19 days. 13 of 30  monkeys demonstrated treatment-emergent ADA (6 in the 0.05 mg/kg, 
1 in the 1 mg/kg and 6 in the 25  mg/kg group). TK parameters were not estimated for 4/6 ADA-positive 
monkeys  in  the  0.05  mg/kg  group  due  to  the  sample  concentrations  less  than  the  LLOQ.  The  data 
collected from  SC administration  male fertility  study  showed was  comparative to  the  DART-study  with 
female monkeys. One monkey in the high dose group demonstrated treatment-emergent ADA. 
Serum TK of  lebrikizumab was  investigated in  pregnant cynomolgus monkeys (SC administration  once 
weekly; 15-150  mg/kg). Samples were collected from dams and fetuses. Dose proportional exposure as 
well  as  Cmax  and  AUC  was  observed in  all  groups.  The  mean fetal  exposure was  approximately 0.3. 
Seven monkeys demonstrated treatment-emergent anti-lebrikizumab antibodies and were excluded from 
the analysis. The offspring with detectable ADAs corresponded to dams with ADAs.  
No bioavailability studies were conducted. 
The type and extent of exposure data and TK parameters varied between toxicology studies and therefore 
the  comparison of  the results  from different studies  is challenging.  However, taking  the  data together, 
the  observed results  are in  line  and  no  TK  differences between  sex nor  in  fertility/DART  studies  were 
recorded. 
ADA  were  observed  in  some  of  the  studies  with  no  clear  association  with  sex  or  lebrikizumab 
concentration  or administration  route. The  presence of ADAs  did  not  seem to  neutralise the  effects  of 
lebrikizumab; however,  the  neutralizing  ADA  assay was  not  performed to  further  investigate  of ADAs 
had  an  effect  to  the  efficacy  of  lebrikizumab  as  described  in  EMA  Guideline  on  immunogenicity 
assessment of monoclonal antibodies intended for in-vivo clinical use (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/ 2010). 
The Applicant has provided data on effects of chronic administration of lebrikizumab on serum total IgE 
from Study 07-1706  to demonstrate sustained activity, however, given the  uncertainties with  the data, 
it can be considered only as supporting information.  
Distribution 
Formal tissue distribution  and protein binding studies were not conducted with lebrikizumab. 
Metabolism and excretion 
No  metabolism  and  excretion  studies  were  conducted  with  lebrikizumab.  No  renal  excretion  of 
lebrikizumab is anticipated due to its molecular size. 
Pharmacokinetic drug-interactions 
Drug-drug  interactions at the  PK level are unlikely for biotechnology-derived substances as they do not 
metabolise  via  CYP  P450  enzymes.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  mechanism  of  action  of  lebrikizumab 
(cytokine secretion) may have an indirect effect on CYP450 activities.  
The  absence  of  these  studies  in  animals  is  accepted,  however,  the  pharmacokinetic  drug-drug 
interactions (DDI)  are assessed in the clinical AR.

Other Pharmacokinetic Studies 
No other pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology  
The toxicology program of lebrikizumab generally follows  the  principles given in  ICH guideline  S6 (R1) 
and ICH M3 (R2). Lebrikizumab binds only to human and cynomolgus monkey IL-13 target, thus leaving 
NHPs as a sole pharmacological relevant species to be used in toxicity testing.  
Toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys were conducted using either CHO-cell-derived toxicology lots 
that  were  characterised  using  contemporary  analytical  methods  (13-week  male  fertility  and  PPND), 
similar  to  CHO  cell-derived clinical  and  commercial lots  or  using  NS0  cell-derived toxicology lots  that 
were characterised using older methods. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity  
There were no biological or toxicological differences between the  individual animals and  their pre-dose 
values. There were no  apparent test  article-related effects on  measured clinical  pathology  parameters 
due to a single intravenous dose of lebrikizumab in cynomolgus monkeys. The highest IV dose 100  mg/kg 
was the maximal non-lethal dose. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat  dose toxicity   
GLP-compliant  repeat-dose studies  of  6 weeks, 13 weeks and 9  months  in duration  were conducted  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys to  evaluate  the  toxicity  and  TK  of  lebrikizumab. Monkeys  of  different  ages and 
maturity (1 to 4.5 years) were used, and IV and SC routes of administration were evaluated. The highest 
dose across these studies  was 25  mg/kg administered once weekly by bolus IV or SC injection  and was 
both well tolerated and without  adverse findings. There were no remarkable changes in peripheral blood 
immunophenotype  (total  lymphocytes,  mature  T  cells,  helper  T  cells,  cytotoxic  T  cells,  total  B  cells, 
NK cells,  monocytes). At  the  9-month  necropsy, absolute  and  relative uterine  weights  were  uniformly 
lower  for  lebrikizumab dose  groups  compared with  the  control  group.  No  abnormalities  of  the  uterus 
were  noted  microscopically at  either  the  3-  or  9-month  necropsy. There  were  no  such  differences in 
uterine weights in a subsequent 9-month IV administration  study in mature female monkeys suggesting 
contribution  of variability in relative sexual maturity to observed difference in uterine weights.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity   
In accordance with ICH S6(R1) no genotoxicity studies were conducted with lebrikizumab. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity   
Carcinogenicity studies  with lebrikizumab were not  conducted. The Applicant used weight-of-evidence -
based approach to assess the carcinogenicity risk of lebrikizumab. The structural and metabolic features 
of the  mAb do  not  suggest potential  for carcinogenicity. In  repeat-dose toxicity  studies in  monkeys no 
evidence of carcinogenicity was observed. The totality of nonclinical and clinical evidence including other 
IL-13 inhibitors used for AD treatment does not suggest carcinogenicity risk of this group of compounds.

2.5.4.5.  Reproductive  and developmental  toxicity   
Fertility  and early embryonic development 
The  main  purpose  of  the  male  fertility  study  was  to  investigate  the  effects  of  lebrikizumab  on 
spermatogenesis and  fertility  endpoints  in  sexually mature  male monkeys during  13 weeks  of dosing. 
This treatment period was sufficient to cover at least 1 full spermatogenic cycle including transit of sperm 
through  the  epididymis.  Monkeys  were  4  to  7 years  of  age  at  study  start,  and  sexual  maturity  was 
confirmed by sperm evaluation. No effects on male reproductive endpoints were observed. Besides signs 
of reaction to injection  in some animals there were no effects in  several general toxicity endpoints  that 
could be attributed to lebrikizumab. No ADA with  effect on lebrikizumab exposure were observed. 
The  purpose  of  the female  fertility  study  was  to  investigate  the  effects  of  lebrikizumab on menstrual 
cycling  and  related fertility  endpoints  in  sexually  mature female  monkeys during  9 months  of  dosing. 
Monkeys were 4.8 to 9.3  years of age at  study start, and sexual maturity was confirmed by evidence of 
menses  and  ovulation,  assessed  by  vaginal  swabs,  and  reproductive  hormone  cycling  within  the 
4 months  prior  to  dosing.  No  toxicity  and  no  clear  treatment-related  effects  on  female  reproductive 
endpoints  were observed. One  high  dose  group  monkey developed serum  polyclonal  gammopathy  of 
uncertain relationship to lebrikizumab. A subset of monkeys had microscopic tissue cysts present in the 
uterus, cervix, parathyroid, thyroid and/or thymus for which a possible relationship to lebrikizumab could 
not  be excluded.  None  of  the  findings  were considered adverse as  such  cysts  do  not  result  in  clinical 
signs or other  detectable abnormalities when they  occur incidentally in  the cynomolgus monkey. Cysts 
in  other affected glands  occurred either  in  lebrikizumab-treated animals only  (parathyroid, thymus)  or 
at a higher incidence compared with  control animals (thyroid). At the  end of the treatment-free period, 
thymic cysts were present with increased incidence in animals given lebrikizumab, while parathyroid and 
thyroid  cysts  were  present  in  control  and  lebrikizumab-treated  animals  in  a  pattern  suggesting  an 
incidental effect. 
Embryo-fetal development 
The purpose of the  embryo-fetal development study was to  assess the potential  effects of lebrikizumab 
on  embryo-fetal  development  when  administered  to  pregnant  cynomolgus  monkeys  throughout  the 
period of major organogenesis. Evaluated maternal parameters included serum chorionic gonadotrophic 
to  confirm  pregnancy, monitoring  of pregnancy status  by  ultrasound,  clinical  chemistry, haematology, 
urinalysis,  toxicokinetics  and  immunogenicity.  Cesarean  (C-)  sections  were  performed  on  GD  100. 
Placental  and  fetal  body  weights  and  measurements  were  recorded.  Fetuses  underwent  a  standard 
teratological evaluation consisting of external, organ/visceral, and skeletal examinations, which included 
organ weights  and  long  bone measurements. Lebrikizumab  concentration  in  fetal  cord blood  was  also 
measured. There was  no  maternal  toxicity  and  no  evidence of  embryo-fetal toxicity  or teratogenicity. 
Seven monkeys across the lebrikizumab treatment  groups were ADA positive; however, only 2 animals, 
1 in each of the low and high dose groups, had reduced serum concentrations consequently. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
The purpose of the  prenatal and postnatal  study was to  assess the potential  effects of lebrikizumab on 
pre- and  postnatal  development in  cynomolgus monkeys. Lebrikizumab was  administered to  pregnant 
animals throughout  gestation and their infant offspring were evaluated through approximately 6 months 
of age. Throughout gestation,  ultrasound was used to monitor pregnancy status, including  fetal viability 
and  growth.  Evaluated maternal  parameters also  included  clinical  chemistry, haematology,  urinalysis, 
serum  concentrations  of  lebrikizumab,  and  immunogenicity  throughout  gestation  and  through  to 
Lactation Day (LD) 180. Infants were evaluated from birth through Postnatal Day (PND)  180. In addition 
to  general health,  infants  were  evaluated  for  growth,  morphological,  functional,  and  neurobehavioral 
development. Evaluated infant parameters also included skeletal examinations on PND7,  immunological

evaluations  on  PNDs  70  and  180,  clinical  chemistry  and  haematology,  serum  concentrations  of 
lebrikizumab and immunogenicity, and ECGs. The overall rate of embryo-fetal loss, including abortions, 
embryo-fetal death,  and  stillbirths  (18.75%  [3/16],  12.5%  [2/16],  and  6.25%  [1/16]  in  control,  low, 
and  high  dose groups, respectively) was  within  the  historical background information  and rate  for this 
species and at  the  Testing  Facility.  Among surviving infants,  there  were no treatment-related  changes 
in physical or functional development parameters. there were no immune system changes, as evaluated 
by  immunophenotype  and  T-cell-dependent  antibody  responses. At  the  terminal  necropsy  of  infants, 
there  were  no  gross findings  and  no  organ weight,  morphometric  measurement, external,  visceral or 
histopathology observations that were considered related to lebrikizumab. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic  data   
Lebrikizumab produced variable incidences of treatment-emergent ADA across studies; presence of ADA 
was  associated  with  reduced  serum  concentrations  of  lebrikizumab  in  some  animals.  Throughout  the 
6-week study, serum trough  concentrations of lebrikizumab showed that  exposure increased in a dose-
proportional manner and accumulated about 4-fold across dose levels. Several animals had low levels of 
ADA  with  no  appreciable impact  on  exposure. In a 9-month  study one  monkey in  each of  the  low and 
mid  dose  groups had  a  positive  ADA titre  that  impacted their  serum lebrikizumab  concentrations and 
AUC  could  not  be  determined for  any dose.  In  13-week  study  no  lebrikizumab-treated monkey had a 
positive ADA titre.  However, no AUC could be determined for male or female monkeys at dose levels of 
5 and 25 mg/kg.  
2.5.4.7.  Local  tolerance   
Injection-site  reactions were  generally not  observed across the  lebrikizumab toxicology  studies  dosed 
either IV or SC. In the male fertility  study, one high dose (25 mg/kg) group monkey had swelling in the 
area of SC dose administration for the majority of the dosing phase and a reaction to  the injection could 
not  be excluded. This clinical  observation did  not  worsen with  repeated dosing  and was not  associated 
with  a  histological  correlate.  Using  modified  Draize  scoring  and  microscopic  evaluation  no  dermal 
irritation was observed. 
2.5.4.8.  Other  toxicity  studies  
Antigenicity 
The repeat-dose general toxicity  studies, fertility  studies,  EFD  and  PPND  studies  each contained direct 
immunogenicity assessment. Validated ELISA methods were used for measuring anti-drug antibodies to 
lebrikizumab.  Immunogenicity  was  also  indirectly  assessed  via  analysis  of  lebrikizumab  serum 
concentrations using an antigen-capture ELISA. 
Immunotoxicity 
Potential effects of lebrikizumab on the innate  and humoral immune systems were evaluated in repeat-
dose studies in monkeys by means of routine haematology, peripheral blood immunophenotyping (total 
lymphocytes,  mature  T  cells,  helper  T  cells,  cytotoxic  T  cells,  total  B  cells,  NK  cells,  monocytes) and 
evaluation  of  lymphoid  organs.  There  were  no  treatment-related  adverse effects  identified  for  these 
endpoints  in  any  study.  T-cell-dependent  antibody  (IgG  and  IgM)  response  to  Keyhole  limpet 
haemocyanin (KLH)  immunisation  was  performed at  about  6  months  of  age  in  the  infant  offspring  of 
lebrikizumab-treated  monkeys. No  statistically  significant  differences were  noted  in  response  to  KLH 
between the control group and lebrikizumab groups.

Studies on impurities 
Toxicology studies were conducted using either CHO cell-derived toxicology lots that were characterised 
using  contemporary analytical methods  (male fertility;  PPND)  or using  NS0  cell-derived toxicology lots 
that  were  characterised using  older  methods.  Despite  the  differences in  material  source  (NS0  versus 
CHO)  and  differences  in  analytical  methods  purity  and  impurity  levels  were  generally  similar  across 
toxicology lots.  The  potential  toxicity  of  lebrikizumab impurities  was  evaluated repeat-dose toxicology 
studies  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Specifications  were  justified  to  be  acceptable  by  providing  >1-fold 
margins of  safety based  on  exposure at  the  NOAEL  in  repeat-dose toxicity  studies compared  with  the 
exposure  to  maximal  theoretical  levels  of  impurities  at  the  recommended clinical  dose  regimen  and 
widest DS/DP  specifications. 
Exposure margins  were  calculated based  Cmax and  Cav,ss values  at  NOAEL  (25  mg/kg  IV  QW)  from 
9-month chronic toxicity study and 9-month female fertility study. Exposure data from the female fertility 
study were used for exposure multiples given limited toxicokinetic data from the chronic toxicity study. 
Exposure multiples, which  were based on the most conservative % impurity in toxicology study batches 
and  the  widest  specifications across DS  and  DP  identified,  were calculated  separately for  purity,  total 
HMWS,  reduced  purity,  non-reduced purity,  and  total  LMWS.  In  all  cases,  exposure multiples,  based 
either on Cmax or Cav,ss, provided enough wide safety margins compared with the exposure to maximal 
theoretical levels of impurities at the recommended clinical dose regimen. 
2.5.4.9  Other  studies  
Ex Vivo Tissue Cross-Reactivity 
The  tissue  binding  specificity  of  lebrikizumab was  evaluated  in  a  comprehensive panel  of  human  and 
cynomolgus  monkey  tissues  in  separate  studies.  Lebrikizumab  was  applied  to  tissue  cryosections 
(3 human  and  2  monkey donors/tissue,  donors/tissue,  where  available) at  concentrations  of  5  µg/mL 
(optimal  concentration)  or  40  µg/mL,  based on  prior method  development.  Lebrikizumab binding  was 
assessed  immunohistochemically  using  biotinylated  lebrikizumab  and  a  direct  avidin-biotin  complex 
immunoperoxidase staining procedure. No specific lebrikizumab staining  was observed in any human or 
cynomolgus monkey tissues. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment  
Lebrikizumab is  a monoclonal antibody  and  it  is classified as  a protein. According to  the  “Guideline on 
the 
Environmental 
Risk 
Assessment 
of 
Medicinal 
Products 
for 
Human 
Use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00corr  2),  proteins are included in products that  are exempted from ERA. Due 
to its  proteic nature and according to the abovementioned criteria of the EMA guideline, lebrikizumab is 
unlikely  to  result  in  a  significant  risk  to  the  environment.  Therefore, ecotoxicological  studies  are  not 
required for lebrikizumab. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
Pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  nonclinical  pharmacology  program  of  lebrikizumab  is  condensed  but  is  considered  adequate 
demonstrating  the  binding  specificity to  target  IL-13  and principal  mode of action.  Lebrikizumab binds 
only  to  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey IL-13  target,  thus  leaving  NHPs  as  a  sole  pharmacologically

relevant species. No surrogates were developed and used in lebrikizumab nonclinical studies. The batches 
(PUR25081,  PUR15846, 3D9-1)  used in the primary pharmacology studies could not  be tracked and this 
required further  clarification. Upon  CHMP’s  request, the  applicant  clarified, that  batches were  by large 
from small  scale preclinical research batches  (from one batch  used  in  Studies S-1043  and S-1044,  no 
information  was  trackable).  The  batches  used  in  toxicology  studies  were  trackable  and  not  the 
development batches  used  in  PD  studies.  Considering that  the  efficacy is  demonstrated  in  the  clinical 
trials, this  issue is not pursued further by the CHMP.   
In  vitro  studies  show  that  lebrikizumab  inhibits  IL-13-induced  phosphorylation  of  STAT6,  the  primary 
downstream  signalling  mediator  of  the  IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα  receptor  complex and  inhibits  IL-13-induced 
proliferation of Hodgkin lymphoma L-1236  and HDLM-2  cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. In these 
assays, lebrikizumab (10 ng/mL)  clearly inhibited  the IL-13  -induced proliferation of TF-1  cells, but  the 
inhibition  of  IL-13-induced  phosphorylation of  STAT6  (the  primary  downstream signalling  mediator  of 
the  IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα  receptor  complex)  was  barely  noticeable.  However,  the  inhibition  of  primary 
downstream  signalling  of  IL-13  was  shown  under the  Quality  data,  where  STAT6 signalling  reflecting 
luciferase activity is  used as a potency  assay and  is not  pursued further  from a non-clinical  viewpoint. 
In  conclusion,  lebrikizumab  binds  with  high  affinity  to  soluble  interleukin  IL-13  and  inhibits  IL-13 
signalling through the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα)/IL-13  receptor alpha 1 (IL-13Rα1) pathway, thereby 
preventing the downstream effects of IL-13 with high selectivity.  
Lebrikizumab  is  a  IgG4  Mab  with  modified  Fc,  which  has  low  binding  ability  to  Fcγ  receptors  or 
components  of  the  complement system  and  thus  has  a  low  effector  function  potential.  No  description 
was  provided  under  the  nonclinical  pharmacodynamics regarding  the  Fc-modification,  and  no  studies 
was included that  characterise Fc-functions (or lack of them, being a IgG4). However, these studies were 
included  under  Quality module  and  demonstrated minimal  binding  affinity to  FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIa and  to 
C1q,  and moderate binding  affinity to  FcγRI. No  secondary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted, 
which is acceptable for a monoclonal antibody. 
The  only in  vivo  functionality  study  was  conducted  in  C57BL/6  mouse airway inflammation  model.  No 
disease  specific  animal  models  for  AD  were  used  to  verify  in  vivo  functionality  of  lebrikizumab. 
Nevertheless, this  issue is  not  pursued  further  as  the  AD  and  airway inflammation  model  share some 
similarities  regarding  the  IL-13  /  STAT6  signalling  routes,  and  lack  of  binding  to  rodent  target  limits 
further the studies in rodents. In addition, serum IgE levels were measured retrospectively on the serum 
samples collected in toxicology study from healthy female cynomolgus monkeys dosed weekly with 0.05, 
1  or 25  mg/kg lebrigizumab  IV for 9-months  (followed by  8-month  recovery period). In  lebrikizumab-
treated  animals,  approximately  25%−40%  reduction  of  baseline  corrected  serum  IgE  levels  were 
recorded,  with  the  greatest  reduction  noted  at  D29.  Nevertheless,  considering  that  the  study  was 
conducted  in healthy  animals whose  baseline IgE levels are expected to  be low  and large inter-animal 
variation in IgE  levels throughout  the  study,  the clinical relevance and the  translation  of these findings 
to AD  cannot be confirmed, however these data can be considered supportive. 
Safety Pharmacology 
There were no safety findings in CNS, respiratory and cardiovascular systems attributed to lebrikizumab. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK/TK program performed with lebrikizumab in Sprague Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys was 
considered  acceptable  demonstrating  the  absorption  the  lebrikizumab  after  single  and  repeat  dose 
exposure. The bioanalytical method is  considered to be adequate for the  measurement of lebrikizumab 
from  the  serum  of  cynomolgus  monkeys  in  PK  and  TK  studies.  The  ELISA  and  ECLA  assays  for  the 
measurement of anti-IL-13  antibodies from  the  serum of cynomolgus monkeys are acceptable. In line 
with  ICH S6,  no distribution,  metabolism or excretion was studied.  For assays S-1040  and S-1042,  the 
Assessment report

FDA  assay criteria were used. EU  acceptance criteria (<15%  or 20%)  are stricter than  the  FDA  criteria 
(<25%).  Therefore, the EU criteria are not necessarily met. However, this  is not considered as an issue 
in this  data set. The absence of other pharmacokinetic studies is accepted. 
Toxicology 
The  Applicant  states  that  the  commonly  used  rodent  species  (mouse,  rat)  were  not  used  since 
lebrikizumab does not bind to rat or mouse IL-13.  However, no information about binding to non-rodent 
species such as the dog or pig IL-13 was given. It is understood that the nonclinical development program 
of  lebrikizumab  for  the  present  MAA  for  AD  was  coordinated  by  the  previous  Sponsor for  a  different 
indication. However, considering the possible option to develop lebrikizumab for other indications in the 
future  it  is  expected that  the  Applicant  has studied  these  alternative species to  assess replacement of 
monkeys in spirit of 3R principles.  
The acute toxicity of lebrikizumab is low. There were no apparent test article-related effects on measured 
clinical pathology parameters due to a single intravenous dose of lebrikizumab in cynomolgus monkeys. 
The highest IV dose 100 mg/kg was the maximal non-lethal dose. 
GLP-compliant  repeat-dose studies  of 6  weeks, 13 weeks and  9 months  in  duration were  conducted in 
cynomolgus  monkeys to  evaluate  the  toxicity  and  TK  of  lebrikizumab. Monkeys  of  different  ages and 
maturity (1 to 4.5 years) were used, and IV and SC routes of administration were evaluated. The highest 
dose across these studies  was 25  mg/kg administered once weekly by bolus IV or SC injection  and was 
both well tolerated and without  adverse findings. 
In humans, ocular disorders such as conjunctivitis and keratitis are quite frequently reported as adverse 
reactions with  of IL-13 inhibitors including  lebrikizumab. Conjunctivitis and keratitis were reported more 
frequently in patients  treated with  lebrikizumab (8.5 % and 0.6% respectively) compared to  placebo in 
controlled clinical studies. Ophthalmological examinations did not suggest any ocular effects in long-term 
repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  healthy  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Differences  in  conjunctivitis  incidence 
across the different allergic diseases suggests that  AD  patients are predisposed to  an increase in ocular 
disorders. In fact, these  types of complications are well  known in  patients with  severe AD (Akinlade et 
al. 2019). Long-term toxicity studies were conducted in healthy cynomolgus monkeys, which would have 
lacked  this  predisposition  for  ocular  disorders.  This  aligns  with  the  data  that  ocular  effects  were  not 
observed in monkeys administered lebrikizumab.   
No consistent  haematological findings,  no alteration (reduction or increase) in lymphocyte subsets, and 
no  histopathologic  changes  in  lymphoid  organs  could  clearly be  seen across  the  repeat-dose toxicity 
studies. However, some haematological parameters’ changes (neutrophil increase, lymphocyte decrease) 
reached statistical significance following lebrikizumab treatment in males of 13-week (2.4-3.4  y old) and 
9-month (2.5-4.5  y old) toxicity study, while no differences were seen in young males (1-2 y old) of the 
6-week  study  and  sexually  mature  monkeys  (4-7 y  old)  in  male  fertility  study.  On  the  other  hand, 
monocyte count and/or ratio was shown to be decreased on several occasions in dams of EFD and PPND 
study.  It  is  well  known  that  immune  system  function  is  age-  and  sex-  dependent.  While  the  e.g. 
immunophenotyping data for the offspring showed comparable means and standard deviations, the data 
for older animals were much  more variable. The  Applicant considered occasional numerical differences 
in  haematology  parameters,  including  some  that  were  statistically  significant,  sporadic/incidental, 
transient,  and/or of  a magnitude  of  change that  is  commonly observed in  laboratory-housed monkeys 
undergoing  similar  study  procedures.  These  differences were  considered not  related  to  lebrikizumab 
treatment and not related to  the age or gender of animals. Where differences were identified during the 
dosing phase of studies, they were inconsistent across the studies conducted, often were present already 
at pretest, did not achieve statistical significance at all time points included in a study, and were typically 
small  changes  and/or  within  laboratory  historical  control  ranges.  On  the  other  hand,  regarding  the 
immunophenotyping data in offspring vs. in older animals, it  is acknowledged that the variability may be

attributed to the age and sex differences as well as the differences in the physiology of individual animals. 
It  can  be  concluded  that  the  link  between  lebrikizumab  and  its  potential  effects  on  immune-related 
endpoints in healthy animals may be complex to establish and may be complicated by the differences in 
the physiology of individual animals.  
Although  IL-13  functions  in immune  response, assessments of immunotoxicity  and immunomodulation 
in monkeys administered lebrikizumab identified no remarkable or consistent changes, even if applied in 
the dose as high as 25 mg/kg/week (claimed to saturate circulating IL-13 levels) producing the exposure 
multiple of 17-20x  when compared to human Cmax. The lebrikizumab toxicology studies were conducted 
using  normal, healthy  cynomolgus monkeys. Given the  absence of disease, IL-13  is  expected to  be at 
low,  constitutive  levels and  not  upregulated  in  monkeys, which  is  in  contrast  to  the  diseased clinical 
population.  Nevertheless,  pharmacological  action  is  evident  by  the  effect  of  lebrikizumab  on  IgE 
pharmacodynamics in monkeys. It has been shown  that  autocrine IL-13  can drive IgE production  from 
B  cells  and  IL-13  receptor  neutralisation  can  reduce IgE  levels. Although  IgE  levels would  have  been 
lower in the normal monkey compared with  a disease state-induced increase in IL-13,  the site localised 
autocrine effect of IL-13 on B cells to drive IgE production would still have been inhibited by lebrikizumab. 
The  Applicant  states  that  immunophenotype  and  TDAR  in  monkeys  have  proven  to  be  relatively 
insensitive  or  inconsistent  for  demonstrating  desired  pharmacology,  whereas  these  immune  system 
endpoints were included in  the toxicology studies to assess the potential  for exaggerated pharmacology 
(gross  effects)  that  could  be  considered  adverse, i.e.,  toxic.  It  is  agreed  that  despite  its  limitations 
monkey  is  the  only  pharmacologically  relevant  model  to  characterise  the  potential  toxicity  of 
lebrikizumab.  
No  genotoxicity studies  were conducted  with  lebrikizumab which  is acceptable. Carcinogenicity studies 
with  lebrikizumab were not  conducted. To  support the  lack of  carcinogenicity risk for lebrikizumab the 
Lebrikizumab  Carcinogenicity  Risk  Assessment  was  provided.  The  totality  of  nonclinical  and  clinical 
evidence including other IL-13  inhibitors used for AD  treatment does not  suggest carcinogenicity risk of 
this group of compounds. 
No significant  findings were observed in reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys.  In  female  fertility  study  a  subset  of  monkeys  had  microscopic  tissue  cysts  present  in  the 
uterus, cervix, parathyroid, thyroid and/or thymus for which a possible relationship to lebrikizumab could 
not  be  excluded.  Cysts  in  other  affected  glands  occurred  either  in  lebrikizumab-treated  animals  only 
(parathyroid, thymus)  or at  a  higher incidence compared with  control  animals (thyroid).  At  the  end  of 
the  treatment-free  period,  thymic  cysts  were  present  with  increased  incidence  in  animals  given 
lebrikizumab,  while  parathyroid  and  thyroid  cysts  were  present  in  control  and  lebrikizumab-treated 
animals in a pattern suggesting an incidental effect. These cysts were interpreted as having an uncertain 
relationship with  test  article because a) cysts  in thymus  are a well-documented  and frequent  common 
background incidental  finding  in  cynomolgus monkeys, b)  thymi  of  sexually mature monkeys undergo 
age-related thymic involution, a physiological process where the thymus progressively undergoes various 
changes  including  loss  of  lymphocytes  and  presence  of  epithelial  remnants,  often  with  a  cystic 
appearance, c) the historical control data for cysts and involution in thymus in  the age-matched control 
female and male cynomolgus monkeys from the conducting facility show that while the overall incidence 
of  cysts in  thymi  in  females and  males are 3.89%  and 9.73%,  respectively, the  individual  studies  can 
have  incidences  as  high  as  50%  and  80%,  respectively. Further,  when  combined  with  the  finding  of 
thymic involution, which might  encompass cystic changes, the overall combined incidence is 12.8% and 
28.8%,  with  individual  studies having  incidences as high as 75%  and  100%,  respectively and d)  Cysts 
in thymus were not present in the 9-month  repeat dose toxicology study  with 3-month  interim sacrifice 
and  the  13-week  repeat-dose toxicity  and  local  tolerability  study  in  both  sexes in  comparable doses 
groups that used sexually immature/peripubertal monkeys. Cysts in thymus were not considered adverse 
regardless of test article-relatedness because cysts in thymus did not result in clinical signs and/or other 
Assessment report

Page 29/209 
 
 
 
pathological  changes  or  abnormalities that  adversely affected  the  quality  of  life  of  these  animals and 
because in  most  tissues,  occasional presence of  cysts  is  not  considered adverse especially in  thymus 
where there is little to no functional significance in adult animals. 
Several deviations from ICH S6(R1) were noted in this procedure: the longest repeat dose toxicity study 
conducted with  monkeys was  9 months and  also included 4  animals/sex/group. Increasing group sizes 
or  study  durations  is  not  required  and  will  generally  not  generate  more  informative  data  than  the 
standard 6 month 3/sex/group, control+3 design. 
In addition, the applicant conducted fertility studies in males and females. A FEED  study in NHP for mAbs 
is  unusual  and  a  rationale  for this  study  remains unclear,  particularly since  no  untoward  effects  were 
noted in the pivotal RDT studies.  An EFD  study is also unusual since IgG transfer is extremely limited in 
the  1st  and  2nd  trimester.  However,  retrospective  discussion  on  these  deviations  from  regulatory 
guidelines is not pursued. 
In a  9-month  study one  monkey in  each of the  low  and mid-dose groups had  a positive ADA  titre  that 
impacted  their  serum lebrikizumab  concentrations and  AUC  could  not  be determined  for any  dose. In 
13-week  study  no  lebrikizumab-treated monkey had  a  positive  ADA  titre.  However,  no  AUC  could  be 
determined for male or female monkeys at dose levels of 5 and 25 mg/kg. The incidences of ADA positive 
responses were much higher in DART studies, when compared with general repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
The  assay formats,  ADA  positive  criteria,  and  drug  tolerance  within  the  assays could  account  for  the 
differences in  ADA  positive  responses  in  DART  studies  compared  to  the  general  repeat  dose  toxicity 
studies. Overall, lebrikizumab exposures were generally dose-proportional in the various toxicity studies. 
While ADA analysis demonstrated a low to moderate rate of ADA detection, toxicokinetic determinations 
demonstrated continued exposure in most animals. 
Validated ELISA methods were used for measuring anti-drug antibodies to lebrikizumab. Immunogenicity 
was also indirectly assessed via analysis of lebrikizumab serum concentrations using an antigen-capture 
ELISA.  The  applicant’s  conclusion  that  in  most  cases  the  presence  of  ADA  appeared  not  to  impact 
lebrikizumab  exposure  in  monkeys  is  not  fully  endorsed.  However,  it  is  generally  accepted  that 
immunogenicity  of  therapeutic  proteins  in  animals  (NHPs  and  other  species)  is  not  predictive  of  the 
immunogenicity in human. 
Potential effects of lebrikizumab on the innate  and humoral immune systems were evaluated in repeat-
dose studies in monkeys by means of routine haematology, peripheral blood immunophenotyping (total 
lymphocytes,  mature  T  cells,  helper  T  cells,  cytotoxic  T  cells,  total  B  cells,  NK  cells,  monocytes) and 
evaluation  of  lymphoid  organs.  There  were  no  treatment-related  adverse effects  identified  for  these 
endpoints  in  any  study.  T-cell-dependent  antibody  (IgG  and  IgM)  response  to  keyhole  limpet 
haemocyanin (KLH)  immunisation  was  performed at  about  6 months  of  age  in  the  infant  offspring  of 
lebrikizumab-treated  monkeys. No  statistically  significant  differences were  noted  in  response  to  KLH 
between the control group and lebrikizumab groups. 
Specifications of impurities in DS and DP are considered as toxicologically qualified. 
No specific lebrikizumab staining was observed in any human or cynomolgus monkey tissues suggesting 
high specificity for IL-13. 
The results of the toxicity studies are reflected in Section 5.3 of the SmPC “Preclinical safety data”. 
Environmental risk assessment 
The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or 
distribution  of the substance in the environment. Therefore, lebrikizumab is not expected to  pose a risk 
to the environment.

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics   
The applicant  presented pharmacokinetic (PK) data  in support  of the  application collected in  6 phase 1 
studies in healthy volunteers, 1 phase 1 study in patients with mild asthma, 3 phase 2 studies in patients 
with  AD, and 4 completed phase 3 studies in patients with  AD (KGAB, KGAC, KGAD, and KGAE).  
Anti-drug  antibodies  (ADAs)  did  not  have  clinically  relevant  effect  on  exposure  to  lebrikizumab,  see 
Clinical safety – Immunological events of this report. 
Bioanalytical  methods  
Serum lebrikizumab concentration 
ELISA based method was developed and validated for the quantification  of lebrikizumab concentrations 
in human serum. The initial validated assay was used in one clinical study (KGBB).  
Subsequently,  the  ELISA  method  was  validated  for  precision,  accuracy,  selectivity,  and  short-term 
stability and used in studies KGAZ, KGBA and KGBF.  
Thereafter, the  ELISA method  was validated  for method selectivity in atopic dermatitis,  IP fibrosis and 
COPD. This method was used in studies KGAG, KGAH, and KGAY. The validation did not meet FDA current 
guidelines  and  the  method  was  partially  further  validated  in  terms  of  accuracy,  precision,  matrix 
selectivity, bench top stability  at ambient room temperature, and freeze/thaw stability. The revalidated 
ELISA-assay was in  principle validated according to  ICH M10  Bioanalytical method validation guideline. 
It was used in clinical studies KGAA, KGAB, KGAC, KGAD, KGAE, KGAF, KGAM and KGBG. 
Anti-drug antibody and neutralising antibody assays 
Both,  developed  ELISA  based  assays  to  characterise  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADAs)  and  neutralising 
antibodies (NAbs)  against  lebrikizumab included  the  validation in  atopic  dermatitis serum and  to other 
disease indications. Later, both assays were validated  for parameters for the AD disease state.  
For phase 3 AD  studies Eli  Lilly developed an   immunogenicity assay to  screen  and to characterise the 
neutralizing ability of ADAs against lebrikizumab. The validation report was provided. 
The  ELISA  based  ADA  and  NAb  methods  used  in  phase  1  and  2  studies  were  acceptable  in  terms  of 
precision, selectivity, and stability but their sensitivity and drug tolerance was clearly lower compared to 
the   method  used in  phase 3  AD  studies.  Screening, confirmatory, titration  and neutralizing  cut  points 
of the  method were acceptable.  
Population PK  analysis  
PK  of  lebrikizumab  in  adult  and  adolescent  (12  to  <18  years of  age  weighing  ≥40  kg)  subjects  was 
characterised  using  population  PK  analysis.  The  dataset  included  lebrikizumab  concentrations  from 
11 studies (four Phase 1 studies with dense PK sampling in healthy volunteers: KGAZ, KGAY, KGAM, and 
KGBA, and  seven  Phase 2  and  3  studies  in  patients  with  AD  with  sparse PK  sampling:  KGAG,  KGAH, 
KGAF,  KGAB, KGAC, KGAD,  and  KGAE). Intravenous administration  was used  in  only  one  small study 
(KGBA; see below for more information on study KGBA).  
The  initial  PK  dataset  contained  8050  postbaseline  observations  from  2015  participants.  A  total  of 
1190  observations were  excluded  from  the  source  data  to  form  the  final  analysis  dataset.  The  most 
common reasons for exclusion were  samples from placebo-treated subjects (n=977)  and  postbaseline 
Assessment report

samples below  the  limit  of  quantitation  from lebrikizumab-treated subjects (n=122).  The  final dataset 
contained  6860  measurable  observations  from  1607  participants  (healthy  subjects,  n=281;  adult 
patients  with  AD,  n=1022;  adolescent  patients  with  AD,  n=304).  The  age  distribution  for  adolescent 
patients  was evenly distributed across 12 to  <18 years of age. Approximately 20% and 2%  of subjects 
had  mildly  (eGFR  60-89  mL/min)  and  moderately  (eGFR  30-59  mL/min)  impaired  renal  function, 
respectively. The  SC  injection  site  locations  most  frequently  used  were  arm  and  abdomen  (51%  and 
37%, respectively), with thigh  and multiple sites being less frequently used for dosing. 
The  base model  was  based on  a  published  lebrikizumab  population  PK  model in  healthy  subjects and 
patients  with  asthma. It  was a 2-compartment  model with  first-order absorption and linear elimination 
parameterised in  terms of bioavailability (F),  first  order absorption  rate constant  (ka), clearance, (CL), 
central and peripheral volume of distribution  (V2 and V3), and intercompartmental clearance (Q). Body 
weight based allometric exponents were included as fixed values of 0.8 on CL and Q, and 1.0 on V2 and 
V3.  Interindividual variability (IIV) terms  were included  on ka,  CL,  V2, and  F  parameters, with  omega 
blocks on CL-ka and ka-V2 terms and a logit transformation on F to restrict the estimate of bioavailability 
to  between 0  and  1.  Residual unexplained variability (RUV)  was incorporated using  a proportional and 
additive error structure. The goodness-of-fit (GOF)  plots and pcVPC plots indicated that  the base model 
adequately described the observed data. 
An  assessment of prespecified covariate effects (including  injection  location) was  conducted  using  the 
SCM  procedure in  PsN  (forward  inclusion  p<0.01,  backward  elimination  p<0.001).  Body  weight  was 
formally tested  on ka only because it  was already included in  the base model on clearance and volume 
parameters. Immunogenicity (ADA) was not tested as a covariate since the Week 52 data from the phase 
3 studies were not available at the time of the population PK analysis. In the SCM, a total  of 9 covariate 
effects were found to be statistically  significant. These covariates were on CL (age, eGFR, and race), V2 
(age, age category, disease state, and sex), and ka (disease state, race) parameters. These 9 covariates 
were then  evaluated stepwise to assess model diagnostics and to determine if these covariates reduced 
their  respective OMEGA variance by  at  least 10%,  as prespecified in  the  analysis plan.  Because these 
covariates did not result in notable improvements in parameter estimates, visible improvements in GOF 
plots,  or reduction in  variance of ≥10%,  they were considered not  significant  and were not  retained in 
the final model. Forest plots and simulations (provided upon request) supported the conclusion that age, 
gender,  race,  eGFR,  and  disease  state  (AD  vs.  healthy  subjects)  had  no  clinically  relevant  effect  on 
exposure  to  lebrikizumab.  Hence,  the  base  model  and  the  final  model  were  the  same.  The  model 
parameters  are  summarised  in  Table  2.  Estimated  interindividual  variability  (IIV)  was  relatively  low 
(around 24%)  for CL  and V2 after body weight  was used as covariate for these parameters, but  for ka 
and F the estimated IIV was moderate to high (45% and 119%, respectively). ETA-shrinkage for CL, ka, 
V2, and F were moderate to high:  24%, 48%,  45%, and 37%,  respectively. The mean (SD)  elimination 
half-life was 24.5 (5.4)  days.

Absorption and bioavailability  
Absorption and bioavailability of lebrikizumab was characterised in healthy volunteers. 
Bioavailability of lebrikizumab was evaluated in one study (KGBA). It was a phase I, randomised, single-
dose, open-label, parallel group study in healthy volunteers conducted at one study site in the Hawaii in 
2008.   
Twenty  of the  22 enrolled subjects  (11 subjects/group, 12  males and  10 females, age 18  to  49 years, 
weight  39.9  to  96.8 kg)  completed  the  study,  while  2  subjects  withdrew  from  the  study  (both  from 
SC group). Each subject received a single dose of lebrikizumab (1 mg/kg) administered by SC injection 
or IV bolus infusion on day 1. Blood samples were taken on day 1 at pre-dose and 30 min post-dose and 
at  days  2,  4,  8,  11,  15,  22,  36,  57,  78  and  92,  and  at  early  termination  as  applicable.  The  initial 
lebrikizumab  concentration  dataset  contained  several  anomalous  values  (e.g.,  measurable  predose 
concentrations  and  very low  concentrations  compared with  other  subjects  at  the  same timepoint).  A 
subset of anomalous data that  was considered most critical to the  estimation of PK parameters was re-
assayed (a total  of 18 samples; most results of the  re-assays were markedly different than the initially 
reported values). Other anomalous data were excluded from the PK analysis; they included but were not

limited  to  one  subject  who  had  high  pre-dose  concentration  confirmed  in  re-assay  (the  subject  was 
excluded from PK analysis) and three subjects with embedded zero concentration values (the embedded 
zero values were excluded from PK analysis).  
The reported exposure parameters and SC bioavailability results are presented in Table 3. After a 
subcutaneous dose of 250 mg lebrikizumab, peak serum concentrations were achieved approximately 
7 to 8 days post dose. The absolute bioavailability was estimated at 86% based on a population PK 
analysis.

a In Group 1 (IV infusion), 1 participant was excluded from PK analysis due to anomalous predose value. One 
participant from Group 1 (IV infusion) and 2 participants from Group 2 (SC injection) were not included for 
assessment of bioavailability based on AUC0-∞ values due to difficulties in estimating the terminal elimination.

PK similarity between pre-filled syringe with  needle safety device (PFS-NSD)  and autoinjector (AI) was 
evaluated in  study KGBG. It  was a phase 1,  multi-site,  randomised, parallel-design, open-label, 2-arm, 
single-dose study conducted in 4 study sites in the USA in 2021-2022. 
Eligible subjects were stratified into 1 of 3 weight categories (less than 70.0  kg, 70.0 to 80.0  kg, greater 
than  80.0  kg),  randomised 1:1  to  delivery device (either  PFS-NSD  [reference] or  AI  [test]),  and  sub-
randomised 1:1:1  to  injection site  (arm, thigh,  or abdomen). A total  of 242 subjects were randomised. 
One subject was identified as a screen failure after the randomisation and did not receive the study drug. 
Two-hundred  and forty-one subjects ((PFS-NSD  =  122,  AI =  119;  104  men and 137  women;  aged 21 
to  65 years, weights  48.3  to 116.5  kg) received one dose of study treatment  per the study  design. Six 
subjects prematurely discontinued from the study resulting in 235 participants that completed the study; 
three discontinued  subjects were included in  assessment of Cmax. PK blood samples were taken at  pre-
dose and days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, 29, 43,  57, 71, 85,  and 99. 
The  statistical  analysis showed  that  2-ml  (125  mg/ml)  lebrikizumab AI had  comparable PK  with  2-mL 
(125  mg/mL) lebrikizumab PFS-NSD  (reference) as the 90%  CIs of the  geometric least squares means 
ratios for  lebrikizumab AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all  completely contained  within  the pre-specified 
confidence limits of 0.80  and 1.25  (Table 4).  Based on a comparison of descriptive statistics,  injection-
site  location  did  not  appear to  impact  lebrikizumab systemic  exposure (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and  Cmax) for 
either device.

PK  similarity  following  administration  of  2  x  1 mL  SC  injections  or  a  single  2 mL  SC  injection  was 
evaluated  in  study  KGAM.  It  was  a  phase  1,  single-centre,  randomised,  2-arm,  parallel  group  study 
conducted  in  one  study  site  in  the  USA in  2018-2019.  Study  drug  was  administered in  the  abdomen, 
upper arm, or thigh.  If the subject  was to  receive two 1-mL  injections,  the  injections were to  be given 
one after the  other in the same body region and same body side (both in the  left arm, both in  the right 
abdomen, etc.); the two injections were to be ≥10 cm from one another.  
Subjects were stratified by albumin level (<4.3 mg/dL, ≥4.3  mg/dL) at screening then randomised 1:1. 
A total of 41 subjects (19  males and 22  females) were randomised and 38  subjects completed the study. 
PK blood samples were collected at baseline (pre-dose), and on days 2,  4, 6, 8,  11, 15,  29, 43, 57,  71, 
85 and 99. 
The statistical analysis (Table 5) showed that  the exposure parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax) were 
comparable, although  similarity was not  formally demonstrated for AUC0-∞ and Cmax because the upper 
and lower limits of 90% CIs, respectively, were outside the pre-specified confidence limit (0.80 to 1.25).

Comparable PK and exposure (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax) parameters between a 125 mg/mL formulation 
of lebrikizumab administered SC by a needle and syringe and a 37.5 mg/mL formulation of lebrikizumab 
administered SC by a pre-filled syringe with needle safety device (PFS-NSD) was demonstrated in study 
KGAY.  Detailed  information  is  omitted  because  the  37.5  mg/mL  formulation  was  terminated  for 
development and used only in this study. 
Distribution and elimination  
The  central  and  peripheral volume  of  distribution  estimates  for  a  typical  subject  (weight  70 kg)  were 
3.86  L and 1.28 L, respectively, in the population PK analysis. This indicates a total volume of distribution 
at  steady state  of  5.14 L.  Body weight  based allometric  exponents were included  in  the  population  PK

model as fixed value of 1.0  on the central and peripheral Vd, indicating larger Vd in subjects with higher 
body  weight.  Similar  results  were  reported  in  individual  clinical  pharmacology  studies  using 
noncompartmental  analysis. Binding  to  plasma  proteins  and  distribution  to  erythrocytes has not  been 
investigated. 
No studies on metabolism and excretion of lebrikizumab were conducted. In the population  PK analysis, 
the CL for a typical subject was 0.154  L/day and mean elimination half-life was approximately 24.5 days 
(SD  5.4 days).  Body weight  based allometric  exponents were  included  in  the  population  PK  model  as 
fixed  value  of  0.8  on  clearance parameters,  indicating  higher  clearance in  subjects  with  higher  body 
weight. Similar results were reported in individual clinical pharmacology studies using noncompartmental 
analysis. 
Dose proportionality  and time dependencies   
Study  KGBB  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  dose-escalation  study  in  healthy 
volunteers. The objectives were to determine the safety, tolerability, and  PK of  lebrikizumab in healthy 
subjects. The study was conducted in 2006-2007  at one clinical study site in the USA. Five dose cohorts 
of 8 subjects each received single IV bolus infusion of lebrikizumab (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects) 
as  a  bolus  infusion.  Lebrikizumab  doses  were  0.1 mg/kg,  0.3  mg/kg,  1.0  mg/kg,  3.0  mg/kg,  and 
5.0 mg/kg. The early phosphate formulation was used in the study. Blood samples for PK were collected 
at predose (Day 1), and 15 minutes  and 1,  2, 4, and 24 hours, and on Days 3, 5, 8,  15, 22, 29,  36, 43, 
57, 78,  and 92 postdose. 
The time-concentration curve for one subject (randomised to lebrikizumab 0.3 mg/kg) was indicative of 
SC dosing, and this subject’s data were excluded from the PK analysis. The PK parameters by dose group 
are summarised in  Table 6.  Lebrikizumab  Cmax and  AUC increased in  approximately dose-proportional 
manner across the 0.1- to 5.0-mg/kg dose range used in this study.

Study  KGBF was a  randomised, double-blind,  placebo-controlled, dose escalation study  that  evaluated 
the safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of four IV doses (0.3 mg/kg, 1.0  mg/kg, and 3.0 mg/kg) 
of lebrikizumab administered Q4W in patients with  mild, intermittent asthma. The primary objective was 
to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  multiple  doses  of  lebrikizumab  in  patients;  the  secondary 
objective was  to  characterise the  PK  and  immunogenicity.  The  study  was  conducted  in  2007-2009  at 
seven study sites in the USA. The early phosphate formulation was used in the study. Blood samples for 
PK were  collected at  predose and  30 minutes  post  dose on  study  drug  administration  Days  0,  28,  56, 
and 84. In addition, PK samples were collected on Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 85, 91, 112, 140, 168,  and 196.

Of  the  37  patients  randomised to  lebrikizumab,  33  completed  the  study  and  were  included  in  the  PK 
population. The PK parameters by dose group are summarised in Table 7. Following multiple  (4) doses, 
lebrikizumab Cmax and  AUC increased in  a  dose-proportional manner and  clearance was  similar across 
the 0.3-  to 3.0-mg/kg dose range used in this study.

Study KGAZ was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study that evaluated the 
safety, tolerability, and  PK following single SC dose administration  of lebrikizumab in  healthy Japanese 
and Caucasian subjects. The primary objective was to  investigate the  safety, tolerability, and  PK of SC 
lebrikizumab in Japanese subjects, and the  secondary objective was to  compare the safety, tolerability, 
and  PK between  healthy Japanese and  Caucasian subjects. The  study  was  conducted  in  2011-2012  at 
one study site in Hawaii. The commercial formulation was used in the study. Blood samples for PK were 
collected at  predose, 4  and 12 hours postdose on  Day 1,  and on  Days 2,  5,  8, 15,  29,  50,  71,  99, and 
Day 120 (or early termination). 
A  total  of  21 Japanese  and  21 Caucasian  participants  were  randomly  assigned  to  lebrikizumab 
(7 Japanese and 7 Caucasian to each lebrikizumab dose group). Two Caucasian subjects randomised to 
125 mg  lebrikizumab withdrew  from  the  study,  one of  them  had  sufficiently  PK  observations and was 
included in the PK analyses. 
The  PK  parameters are  presented in  Table  8.  In  Japanese subjects,  dose  normalised Cmax  and  AUC 
values were comparable and  the  CL/F  was  similar across the  125-  to  375-mg  dose range used  in  this 
study.  In Caucasian subjects, dose normalised AUC0-inf values were comparable, but  dose normalised 
Cmax and AUC0-t  were increased in the 375  mg dose qroup. Statistical  analysis using the power model 
to  assess dose  proportionality  showed  that  the  slope  estimate  (90%  CI)  was  1.08  (0.85,  1.32),  0.99 
(0.79,  1.19),  and 0.98 (0.77,  1.18)  in Japanese subjects and 1.39 (1.25,  1.53),  1.17  (1.01,  1.32), and 
1.13  (0.97,  1.29)  for  Caucasian  subjects  for  Cmax,  AUC0-t,  and  AUC0-∞  adjusted  for  weight, 
respectively.

The proposed dosing  regimen, which  was used  in  the  pivotal phase 3  studies,  consists  of an  induction 
phase  (500 mg  SC  at  weeks  0  and  2,  followed  by  250  mg  SC  Q2W  up  to  week 16),  followed  by  a 
maintenance  phase (250  mg  SC  Q4W).  Exposure to  lebrikizumab will  be highest  during  the  induction 
phase  and,  based  on  simulations  using  the  final  population  PK  model,  the  steady  state  average 
concentration  (Cavg,ss) will  be  approximately 50%  lower  during  the  maintenance phase  compared with 
the induction  phase (Figure 1 and Table 9).

Special  populations  
Dedicated  studies  in  special  populations  were  not  conducted.  Potential  effects  of  intrinsic  factors 
[including  age, weight,  gender, race, markers of renal and hepatic function,  and disease state (patients 
with  AD vs healthy subjects)] on PK parameters were tested in population PK analysis.  
Exposure is  inversely correlated with  body weight  (Figure  2 and Table 10).  Interindividual variability in 
observed serum  lebrikizumab  levels can  be  partly,  but  not  entirely,  attributed  to  differences in  body 
weight.

The  predicted  mean  steady state  exposure in  adolescents  (12  to  <18  years of  age  weighing  ≥40  kg) 
with  AD  was  approximately 20%  higher compared with  adults,  which  was attributed  to  the  lower body 
weight  distribution in  adolescents.  
Age (range: 12  to 93  years), gender, race, and markers of renal and hepatic  function  were considered 
not  to  have meaningful effect on  PK. The  number of 65-74  years old,  75-84  years old,  and ≥85  years 
old subjects in the PK dataset were 71, 17, and 3, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  
No formal studies have been conducted to examine the effect of lebrikizumab on the PK of other drugs. 
Monoclonal antibodies  are not anticipated  to  directly impact the  PK of other  drugs. Published literature 
(Davis  et al.  2018)  indicates that  blockade of the  IL-4α receptor (thus  blocking IL-13  activity)  was not 
associated with  changes in CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, or CYP2D6  activity following 4 weeks of 
treatment in patients  with AD.  Based on these data, it  is unlikely that  lebrikizumab (an anti-IL-13  mAb) 
will have an effect on the PK of other drugs due to potential drug-disease interactions. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics   
Mechanism  of action 
Lebrikizumab is an immunoglobulin (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to 
interleukin (IL)-13 and selectively inhibits IL-13 signalling through  the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα)/ 
IL-13 receptor alpha 1 (IL-13Rα1) heterodimer, thereby inhibiting the downstream effects of IL-13. 
Inhibition  of IL-13 signalling is expected to be of benefit in diseases in which IL-13 is a key contributor 
to the disease pathogenesis. Lebrikizumab does not prevent the binding of IL-13 to the IL-13 receptor 
alpha 2 (IL-13Rα2 or decoy receptor), which allows the internalisation of IL-13 into the cell.

Primary  and Secondary  pharmacology 
Limited  pharmacodynamic data were collected in  the clinical program, mainly clinical efficacy endpoints 
were used  in  the  proof-of-concept and  dose finding  studies.  PD  biomarker data  were not  evaluated in 
phase 3 studies in patients with  AD. 
Study KGAG was a preliminary Phase 2  study to evaluate the efficacy of lebrikizumab plus TCS vs. TCS 
alone in moderate to severe AD. A total of 212  patients were randomised 1:1:1:1, 209 of whom received 
study drug (and TCS) as follows: lebrikizumab 250 mg SC single-dose, lebrikizumab 125  mg SC single-
dose, lebrikizumab 125 mg SC at weeks 0, 4, and 8, placebo. The 12-week treatment period was followed 
by  an  8-week  safety  follow-up  period.  Changes  in  candidate  biomarkers in  patients  with  AD  [serum 
periostin, IgE,  CCL-13  (monocyte chemotactic  protein-4),  CCL-18 (pulmonary and  activation-regulated 
chemokine), and peripheral blood eosinophils] were evaluated as an exploratory objective in the study. 
Lebrikizumab (combined with  TCS) decreased the  levels of CCL-13,  CCL-18,  and periostin compared to 
placebo (TCS only).  Median  reduction from baseline (%)  to  week  1  was  25.7-33.2%  and  52.3-58.4%, 
for  CCL-13  and  CCL-18,  respectively, in  the  lebrikizumab arms  compared to  3.4%  and  12.1%  in  the 
placebo arm (Table 11). The percent reductions from baseline were generally sustained through the 12-
week treatment  period  in  the  lebrikizumab  arms. Median  reduction  from  baseline (%)  to  week 1  was 
8.3-10.6%  for periostin in the lebrikizumab arms compared to 1.4% in the placebo arm. Serum periostin 
levels continued to gradually decline during the study in all lebrikizumab treatment arms (Table 11).   
Peripheral blood  eosinophils tended  to  increase above baseline  levels in  lebrikizumab-treated patients 
(Figure  3).  Between-subject  variability  in  serum  IgE  levels  was  high.  Overall,  a  gradual  reduction  in 
median serum total IgE occurred in both the placebo and lebrikizumab arms during the treatment phase, 
with  the  decline continuing  throughout  the  safety follow-up  period.  At  the  end  of  the  safety follow-up 
period  (Week 20),  the  median  decrease in  IgE  levels  from  baseline  was  28.7%,  37.3%,  40.0%  and 
25.6%  in  lebrikizumab  250  mg  single  dose,  125  mg  single  dose,  125  mg  Q4W  and  placebo  arms, 
respectively.  
Overall, the  responses were comparable in  each lebrikizumab dose groups, i.e., no  dose-response was 
observed for these PD biomarkers.

KGAG).   
The  effect  of  lebrikizumab  on  serum  PD  biomarkers  was  also  evaluated  in  randomised,  placebo-
controlled, double-blind phase 3 studies KGAN and KGAO in patients with asthma. In these two studies, 
serum levels of CCL-13, CCL-17, periostin, and IgE decreased in patients treated with lebrikizumab.   
Lebrikizumab  induced  no  hERG  inhibition  in  vitro  at  test  concentrations  up  to  6.0  mg/mL,  which  is 
markedly higher than clinical exposure (Table 9). 
Relationship between  plasma concentration  and  effect   
Exposure-response  (E-R)  model  was  developed  including  efficacy  data  (EASI)  up  to  Week 16  from 
5 randomised, double-blind,  placebo-controlled Phase 2  and  Phase  3  trials  in  patients  with  AD:  KGAF, 
KGAG (data up to week 12), KGAB, KGAC and KGAD.  
A placebo model was developed first. Exploratory graphical analyses indicated response to placebo and 
use  of  topical  corticosteroids  (TCS)  appeared  to  improve  the  response,  as  expected.  The  placebo 
response was  described by  an  indirect  effect  model,  including  a  TCS  effect  on  Kout and  study  effects 
(Phase 2 vs Phase 3)  on baseline EASI. Other structures  (direct effect, asymptotic,  linear model) were 
explored, but  indirect  effect was  most  predictive (lowest  OFV).  The  logit  fractional  placebo effect was 
found to be most stable and was used in all models. 
Lebrikizumab  treatment  data  were  added  to  the  placebo  model  using  the  individual  EBEs  from  the 
population  PK  model.  Treatment  effect,  linear,  Emax  and  sigmoidal  Emax  drug  effect  models  were 
evaluated; the  inhibitory Emax model provided the  best fit. The TCS effect on  Kout was re-evaluated with 
Assessment report

the  addition  of  lebrikizumab-treated patients.  A  time-varying  effect was  added  to  the  model  (ΔOFV  -
13.7),  then rewritten by expanding the TCS effect on Kout described in the placebo model.  
Different implementations of random effects models were also assessed. The off-diagonal block from the 
placebo model was removed and rearranged to include correlation between the individual estimated EASI 
baseline and placebo effect, which improved model fit. Switching  IIV from Emax to EC50 provided a lower 
condition  number. Lastly, allowing  estimation of Kout showed strong improvement in the  model fit.  This 
final structural model was carried forward for the evaluation of patient covariate effects. 
Covariates of interest  were explored graphically. Potential trends  in continuous  body weight  were seen 
versus Kout  and  EC50.  Age and  body  weight  were  tested  as  covariates on  Emax and  EC50  but  were  not 
found to be significant. Study effect on estimated population baseline EASI score was re-evaluated as a 
covariate effect.  With  the  addition  of  the  treatment  data,  the  study  effect was  re-stratified  into  three 
groups:  KGAG (mean baseline  25.4),  KGAF  and  KGAD  (mean  baseline 26.8),  KGAB and  KGAC (mean 
baseline 29.0).  This  adjustment  in  the  baseline effect  was  significant  and  allowed the  model  to  more 
accurately identify responders relative to each group.  
The final model comprised an indirect effect, including a time varying TCS effect on Kout and study effects 
on baseline EASI (Figure 4 and Table 12).

12.9%, 32.1%,  24.9% and 53.6%, respectively. Due to high shrinkage values the model evaluation and 
predictive  performance  relied  mostly  on  VPC.  Logit-transformed  EASI  scores  were  reasonably  well 
described by the final model, with  good agreement between predicted and observed data through week 
12  (KGAG) and  week  16  (all  other  studies)  (Figure  5).  The percentage  change from  baseline (%CFB) 
EASI  score was  reasonably well  described for  those  with  typical  (median)  and  good  (95th percentile) 
response but the model underpredicted the response for those with poor response (5th percentile).

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
Bioanalytical  methods 
Serum lebrikizumab concentrations 
The  ELISA  method  was  validated  For  performance  of  calibration  standards,  precision,  accuracy, 
selectivity, and  short-term  stability  of the  assay were acceptable. The Genentech method  was  used in 
studies  KGAZ,  KGBA,  and  KGBF.  Bioanalysis  of  lebrikizumab  samples  in  these  clinical  studies  met 
precision and accuracy acceptance criteria and the performance of calibration standards was acceptable.  
Subsequently,  the  ELISA  assay  was  validated  according  to  ICH  M10  Bioanalytical  method  validation 
guideline. The  partial re-validation was done with  different lebrikizumab batch than  the  validation  and 
these  methods  were  shown  to  be  comparable. The  revalidated  method  showed  acceptable accuracy, 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 53/209 
 
 
 
 
 
precision, selectivity, stability and parallelism and was used in clinical studies KGAA, KGAB, KGAC, KGAD, 
KGAE,  KGAF,  KGAM  and  KGBG. The  bioanalytical  reports  of  these  clinical  studies  indicated  that  the 
sample  analysis  was  reliable  within  the  given  accuracy and  precision  ranges.  The  reasons  for  repeat 
analysis were acceptable and the required criteria for incurred method analysis was met.  
ADA and NAb  
In  phase 1  and  2  studies,  ELISA  based methods  were utilised  to  characterise ADAs  and NAbs  against 
lebrikizumab. For phase 3 clinical trials Eli Lilly developed an  immunogenicity assay for the  detection of 
ADAs and NAbs in the healthy and AD serum samples.  
The original ELISA based ADA and NAb  methods were acceptable in  terms of precision, selectivity, and 
stability  but  their  sensitivity  and  drug  tolerance  was  lower  compared  to  the  immunogenicity  assay 
method. Therefore, it  is difficult to  compare the prevalence and incidence of ADAs and NAbs in  phase 1 
and 2 vs. phase 3 studies. Assessment of the  ADA/NAb assays is focused on the immunogenicity assay 
method that  was used in the pivotal studies  in target population.  Screening, confirmatory, titration  and 
neutralizing  cut  points  immunogenicity  assay  method  were  determined  in  an  acceptable  manner. 
ADA/NAb bioanalytical reports for studies KGAA, KGAB, KGAC, KGAD and KGAE were provided and were 
within  the given accuracy and precision ranges. 
PD biomarkers 
Candidate PD  biomarkers were determined in  two  phase 2 AD  studies, one of which  was a small  open-
label study,  and two  asthma studies.  No  validation reports for the  PD biomarker bioanalytical methods 
were  provided  in  the  dossier.  This  is  not  pursued  because the  candidate  PD  biomarker  data  are  not 
considered essential for the application. 
Bioanalytical methods used in clinical study KGAK 
In  clinical  study  KGAK two  bioanalytical  methods  for  the  determination  of  bactericidal antibody  (SBA) 
against Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup C  and tetanus  Toxoid IgG in human  serum were utilised.  SBA 
method  was  validated  in  terms  of  precision,  accuracy,  linearity,  specificity  and  stability  (ambient 
temperature and freeze/thaw) and was considered acceptable. Only high-level summary of the validation 
results  for  anti-tetanus  Toxoid  IgG Enzyme  Immunoassay method  was  provided  but  according  to  the 
summary  the  validation  seems  to  be  appropriate.  The  bioanalytical  report  of  clinical  study  KGAK 
regarding SBA was provided but only contained information about control performance which, however, 
seems to  be acceptable.  The  Applicant  committed  to  provide  the  final  bioanalytical  report for  tetanus 
toxoid IgG by the end of November 2023. 
Population PK  analysis 
The dataset included in the original population PK analysis includes only data from Induction  period (up 
to  week 16)  and  not  from maintenance period of the  phase 3  studies.  The Applicant  provided updated 
population PK analysis with  data from maintenance period (from weeks 16 to 52) included; the majority 
of the new data were trough concentrations at steady state. The model estimates from the  original and 
the updated datasets parameters were similar and had overlapping 95% CI. 
The  model  development  strategy  was  generally appropriate;  the  fixed  allometric  exponent  (0.8)  for 
clearance parameters differs slightly from the more commonly used exponent 0.75, but it is unlikely that 
this would significantly affect the parameter estimates and applicability of the model. Most  of the THETA 
parameters  were  estimated  with  good  precision  (low  standard  error  of  estimate)  but  ETA  shrinkage 
values were high (24% to 48%), probably due to sparse sampling in majority of subjects and low number 
of subjects with  IV administration. The pcVPC plots indicated that  the base model adequately described 
the observed data.   
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 54/209 
 
 
 
Only  linear  (dose-independent)  CL  was  tested  in  model  development. This  is  acceptable  because the 
model  adequately  described  the  observed  data  and  non-compartmental  analyses  of  several  studies 
indicated that  clearance of lebrikizumab is similar over the investigated dose range.   
The  estimate  for  SC  bioavailability  (0.861,  or  86.1%)  is  larger  than  that  usually  reported  for  mAbs 
(typically  ~60-70%)  and  the  interindividual  variability  of  the  estimate  was  high  (CV%  of  119).  This 
estimate  is  based  on  little  data  following  IV  administration,  which  are  from  one  study  (KGBA). 
Supplementary  information  was  provided  upon  request,  including  additional  PK  data  following  IV 
administration in patients  with  asthma. These data supported the initial estimate for SC bioavailability.   
A total of 9 covariates were statistically  significant in the  SCM but not  considered relevant based on the 
definitions  pre-specified  in  the  analysis  plan  (age,  eGFR,  and  race on  CL;  age, age  category, disease 
state,  and  sex  on  V2;  disease  state  and  race  on  ka.  Forest  plots  and  simulations  (supplementary 
information provided upon request) supported the  conclusion that  age, gender, race, eGFR, and disease 
state (AD  vs. healthy subjects) had no clinically relevant effect on exposure to lebrikizumab.  
Absorption and bioavailability 
Four  studies  (KGBA,  KGAY,  KGAM,  and  KGBG)  in  healthy  subjects  were  carried  out  to  evaluate 
bioavailability  of  lebrikizumab  after  SC  administration  and  PK  similarity  of  different  formulations  or 
devices. The  general problem in  these studies  was  that  the  study  sampling  periods were  too  short  to 
optimal  characterise the whole  PK profile, and the  PK sampling could have been more frequent around 
the tmax.  
In study KGBA the PK of lebrikizumab following SC and IV administration was evaluated, and the absolute 
SC bioavailability was estimated. According to the  clinical study report there were numerous anomalous 
values  in  lebrikizumab  concentrations,  which  were  attributed  to  suspected  problems  with  the 
bioanalytical  assay.    Supplementary  information  was  provided  upon  request,  including  sensitivity 
analysis  for  study  KGBA  and  additional  PK  data  following  IV  administration  in  patients  with  asthma. 
These data supported the initial estimate for SC bioavailability. 
PK similarity  was established  between the  PFS-NSD  and the  AI devices in  study  KGBG. The  geometric 
means for the primary PK parameters (i.e., Cmax, AUC0-tlast and AUC0-∞) were slightly higher with  AI than 
with  PFS-NSD and the 90%  CIs were above 1 (not including  the unity in the range). The differences are 
not considered clinically relevant.   
The  KGAM  study  showed  overall  comparable total  exposure (AUC)  of  250 mg  doses  administered  by 
2 injections  x 1 mL  and  a single  injection of  2 mL.  The geometric mean Cmax was  11%  lower following 
the  single  injection  of  2 mL,  suggesting  that  absorption  is  slightly  more  rapid  following  2  separate 
injections.  Results of study KGAM have no impact on the benefit/risk profile because both  applied drug 
products  (PFS-NSD  and  AI)  contain  250 mg  of  lebrikizumab  in  2 mL  solution  (125  mg/mL,  which  is 
administered as a single injection. This method of administration was used in the pivotal phase 3 studies.  
In study KGAY, the studied histidine formulations 37.5 mg/mL by a PFS-NSD and 125  mg/mL by a needle 
and syringe were shown  to have similar PK.  Results of study  KGAY have little  significance because the 
37.5  mg/mL formulation was terminated for development and used only in this study. 
The proposed method of administration (section 4.2 of the SmPC) is SC injection into the thigh, abdomen, 
or upper arm. This is acceptable; results of the population  PK analysis and study  KGBG indicate that no 
clinically meaningful difference in exposure is expected between the three injection sites. This has been 
adequately reflected in SmPC section 5.2.

Distribution and elimination 
The  PK  of  lebrikizumab  in  adult  and  adolescent  populations  was  characterised  using  population  PK 
analysis. The  estimated  total  volume of  distribution  and clearance for a  70-kg  subject  at  steady state 
were  5.14  L  and  0.154  L/day,  respectively,  and  the  estimated  mean  elimination  half-life  was 
approximately  24.5  days  (SD  5.4  days).  Comparable  values  were  reported  in  individual  clinical 
pharmacology studies using  noncompartmental analysis. These values are similar to those reported for 
several mAb drug products.   
Metabolism  and excretion pathways,  binding  to  plasma proteins, and  distribution  to  erythrocytes were 
not investigated. This is acceptable because lebrikizumab is a large protein.  
Dose proportionality  and time dependencies 
Formal statistical assessment of dose proportionality was not conducted in studies KGBB and KGBF, but 
dose  normalised  AUC  values  suggested  no  meaningful  deviation  from  dose  proportionality  in  these 
studies. In study KGAZ, statistical analysis to assess dose proportionality was conducted using the power 
model for exposure parameters (Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0- ∞ adjusted for weight).  In Japanese subjects, 
the  90%  CI  of  the  slope  estimate  of  each  parameter  contained  1.0  indicating  dose  proportionality, 
whereas in  Caucasian subjects  the  slope estimate  (90%  CI)  was  1.39  (1.25,  1.53),  1.17  (1.01,  1.32), 
and 1.13 (0.97, 1.29) for weight-adjusted Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞, respectively, indicating slightly more 
than  dose  proportional increase in  exposure, especially for Cmax. In  addition,  sparse PK  sampling data 
from studies  KGAF and KGAG indicated  dose proportionality (data  shown in  Clinical AR). The  dose was 
not tested as a covariate on PK parameters in population PK analysis and time-dependent clearance was 
not  evaluated, but  linear clearance adequately described the observed data. Based on the overall data, 
the  Applicant’s conclusion  of dose proportional PK is  acceptable. This information  has been adequately 
reflected in SmPC section 5.2.  
PK  in target  population 
The proposed dose regimen (induction phase: 500  mg SC at weeks 0 and 2 followed by 250  mg SC Q2W 
up  to  week 16,  followed  by  maintenance  phase  250 mg  SC  Q4W),  was  used  in  the  pivotal  phase  3 
studies; a more frequent maintenance phase regimen (250 mg Q2W) was also tested in them. Using the 
proposed regimen, exposure to  lebrikizumab is  highest  during  the  first 16  weeks and  the  steady state 
average concentration  (Cavg,ss) is  approximately 50%  lower  during  the  maintenance  phase  compared 
with  the induction  phase. 
Special  populations 
Dedicated  studies  in special populations  (e.g.,  patients  with  impaired renal  and hepatic  function)  were 
not  conducted,  which  is  acceptable  because  lebrikizumab  is  a  large  protein  and  is  not  expected  to 
undergo  significant  renal  or  hepatic  elimination.  Potential  effects  of  intrinsic  factors  [including  age, 
weight,  gender,  race,  markers of  renal  and  hepatic  function,  and  disease  state  (patients  with  AD  vs 
healthy  subjects)]  on  PK  parameters  were  tested  in  population  PK  analysis.  Exposure  is  inversely 
correlated with body weight. The predicted mean steady state exposure in adolescents (12 to <18  years 
of  age weighing  ≥40  kg) with  AD  was  approximately 20%  higher  compared with  adults,  which  can  be 
attributed  to  the  lower body weight  distribution  in  adolescents.   The Applicant  did  not yet  have clinical 
data on PK, efficacy, and safety of lebrikizumab in subjects weighing < 40 kg. The other aforementioned 
subject characteristics were considered not to have meaningful effect on PK in the population PK analysis. 
Based on  the  population  PK  analysis, dose  adjustment  in  special populations  is  not  warranted.  These 
issues are reflected in sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC.

PK  drug interactions 
Monoclonal antibodies  are not anticipated  to  directly impact the  PK of other  drugs. Published literature 
indicate  that  blockade  of  the  IL-4α  receptor  (thus  blocking  IL-13  activity)  was  not  associated  with 
changes in CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, or CYP2D6  activity in  patients with  AD. Hence,  PK drug 
interactions are not expected for lebrikizumab in the target population and the corresponding information 
in section 4.5 of the SmPC is acceptable.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic endpoints have limited value for the current application. Nevertheless, they do provide 
some  limited  evidence that  the  use  of  lebrikizumab  can  modulate  the  IL-13  pathway.  Mainly  clinical 
efficacy endpoints were used in the proof-of-concept and dose finding studies.  
Changes  in  candidate  biomarkers  in  patients  with  AD  [serum  periostin,  IgE,  CCL-13  (monocyte 
chemotactic protein-4),  CCL-18  (pulmonary and activation-regulated  chemokine), and peripheral blood 
eosinophils] were evaluated as an  exploratory objective in one randomised double-blind phase 2 study 
(KGAG).  The  results  indicated  that  treatment  with  lebrikizumab  (plus  TCS)  was  associated  with 
decreased CCL-13,  CCL-18,  and periostin  levels, and  increased peripheral blood  eosinophils compared 
with  placebo  (plus  TCS).  Serum  IgE  levels  decreased  similarly  in  lebrikizumab-  and  placebo-treated 
patients.  No  dose-response association was  observed for any of  the  biomarkers (lebrikizumab 125 mg 
single  dose  vs.  250  mg  single  dose  vs.  125  mg  three  doses  Q4W).  In  addition,  PD  biomarker data 
including  CCL-17  were evaluated  in  patients  with  asthma  in  two  phase  3  studies  (KGAN  and  KGAO). 
Overall, the  results  indicate  that  treatment  with  lebrikizumab was associated with  decreased levels of 
serum periostin,  CCL-13,  CCL-17,  CCL-18,  and  IgE, although  the  between-subject  variability was very 
high for IgE.  
During  the  assessment,  the  Applicant  provided  the  results  of  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  study  to  assess the  impact  of  lebrikizumab on  vaccine immune  responses  in  adult  patients 
with  moderate-to-severe AD [Study  J2T-MC-KGAK (KGAK)]. The vaccines used in  the study  were Tdap 
(Diphtheria  and  Tetanus  Toxoids  and  Acellular  Pertussis  Vaccine  Adsorbed;  Sanofi),  and  MCV 
(Meningococcal  (Groups  A,  C,  Y,  and  W-135)  Oligosaccharide Diphtheria  CRM197  Conjugate  Vaccine; 
GlaxoSmithKline). The results are reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
An exposure-response (E-R) analysis was conducted by the Applicant. The dataset included efficacy data 
(observed EASI) up to Week 16 from 5 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 and Phase 
3 trials:  KGAF, KGAG (data up to  week 12),  KGAB, KGAC and KGAD. Exposure was based on individual 
empirical Bayesian estimates from a population PK model. Approximately 10.0% (n=131)  of subjects in 
the dataset were adolescents (12 to <18 years of age). Because the proposed posology was investigated 
in the pivotal phase 3 trials, the E-R model is considered as supportive information. Model development 
was overall acceptable, although some details were not sufficiently presented. The E-R model was built 
using  up  to  16  weeks efficacy data (i.e.,  induction  phase), and  it  was  able to  adequately describe the 
EASI  response  from  week  0  to  week  16.  However,  supplementary  information  provided  during  the 
assessment indicated that the E-R model could not accurately describe the observed clinical efficacy from 
week 16 to week 52 in studies KGAB and KGAC. Given the low impact of the E-R model for the marketing 
authorisation application these issues are not further pursued by the CHMP.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology  
The PK profile of lebrikizumab has been adequately characterised although it relies mostly on 
population PK analysis. The final proposed dosing regimen is acceptable. Appropriate information 
relevant for the prescribers and patients has been included in the SmPC and package leaflet.

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The pivotal Phase 3 studies in AD are shown in Table 13. 
Table  13:  Pivotal Phase  3 Studies in AD  
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study  
The selection of doses into the pivotal Phase 3 studies was based on Phase 2b dose-ranging study KGAF. 
The study included patients ≥18  years with chronic AD that  had been present for ≥1 year. Patients had 
moderate-to-severe AD, defined by EASI score ≥16, an IGA score ≥3, and ≥10% BSA of AD involvement. 
Patients  were  to  have  a  history  of  inadequate  response  to  treatment  with  topical  medications  or 
determination that  topical treatments were medically inadvisable. 
The patients participated in the study up to  a maximum of approximately 36 weeks, including screening 
period (up to approximately 4 weeks), a treatment  period (baseline through Week 16), and a follow-up 
period (through Week 32). 
Altogether 280  patients  were enrolled; 73,  80,  and  75 patients  to the  lebrikizumab 125 mg  Q4W  (with 
250 mg loading dose at week 0), 250 mg Q4W (with  500 mg loading dose at week 0), and 250  mg Q2W 
(with 500  mg loading dose at weeks 0 and 2) groups, respectively, and 52 patients to the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 58/209 
 
 
 
 
  
All  280 randomised  patients  were  included  in  the  mITT  population  defined  as  all  randomised patients 
who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The primary and key secondary endpoints are shown in Table 
14. 
Table  14:  Primary  and  Key  Secondary  Endpoints for Study KGAF at Week  16  
In terms of lebrikizumab doses in  the pivotal studies,  the data from the  16-week Phase 2b study  KGAF 
supported selection  of the  lebrikizumab 250  mg  Q2W  (with  the  500  mg loading  doses at  weeks 0 and 
week 2) as the induction dose (weeks 0-16) for the Phase 3 studies.   
2.6.5.2.  Main  studies  
KGAB  and KGAC  studies had an identical title:  “a randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trial to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis” 
KGAD  was  titled:  “a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  to  evaluate  the  efficacy and 
safety of  lebrikizumab when used  in  combination  with  topical  corticosteroid  treatment  in  patients  with 
moderate-to severe atopic dermatitis” 
KGAB and KGAC studies had identical design and therefore the studies are described together.

Methods  
KGAB  and KGAC  studies 
KGAB  and  KGAC  studies  were  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  studies 
designed to confirm the  safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in  adults  and adolescents (12  to  less than 
18 years of age that weighted at least 40 kg) with moderate-to-severe AD.  
Both  studies  had  a  screening  period  30  to  7 days  before  the  baseline  visit  (day  1)  and  a  16-week 
induction treatment  period  followed by a 36-week long-term maintenance  treatment  period  up 
to  52 weeks of  total  treatment.  Patients who  terminated early from the  study  or did  not  enroll in  the 
long-term extension study  (KGAA), underwent  a follow-up  visit approximately 12 weeks after the  last 
study drug injection. 
During  the  16-week  induction  period,  the  patients  were  randomised  (2:1)  to  receive  lebrikizumab 
250 mg  Q2W  (loading  dose  of  500  mg  given  at  baseline  and  week  2)  or  placebo  Q2W.  Patients 
considered to have responded to treatment were defined as having an IGA score of 0 or 1, or at least a 
75%  reduction in  EASI (EASI 75  from  baseline to  Week 16,  and  not  receiving any  rescue treatment 
during  the  induction  period).  After  completion  of  the  Week  16  visit,  patients  who  responded  to  the 
lebrikizumab treatment were randomly reassigned (2:2:1)  to lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W, lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q4W or placebo. 
Patients  who  did  not  achieve an  IGA of  0  or  1  nor  an  EASI 75  at  Week 16  or  who  received topical  or 
systemic rescue therapy between  baseline to  Week 16  were assigned to  an  Escape Arm and received 
open-label  lebrikizumab  250 mg  Q2W  through  Week 52.  Patients  who  had  received  placebo  during 
Induction Period initiated lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W after loading doses. 
Following re-randomisation at Week 16, patients not maintaining an EASI 50 response at Weeks 24, 32, 
40, or 48 were assigned to an Escape Arm and received open-label lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W through 
Week 52. 
Patients who did  not achieve an EASI 50 response in  the Escape Arm after 8 weeks of treatment  were 
terminated from the study.

KGAD  study 
KGAD  study  was  a  randomised,  double  blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  study  designed  to 
evaluate the  safety and  efficacy of  lebrikizumab +  TCS  compared with  placebo +  TCS in  adults  and 
adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age that  weighted at least 40 kg) with moderate-to-severe AD.  
The study had a screening period 30 to 7 days before the baseline visit (day 1) and 16-week treatment 
period. After completion of the Week 16 visit, patients were offered the option to continue treatment in 
a separate long-term extension study (KGAA). Patients who terminated early or chose not to enter the 
long-term extension study,  underwent a safety follow-up  approximately 12 weeks after the last  study 
drug injection.

20. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during 
the study. 
KGAD  study 
The  eligibility  criteria for  the  KGAD  study  were identical  to  the  criteria  in  the  KGAB and KGAC studies 
(see above), except for the following:  
• 
Concerning  the  inclusion  criteria  “History  of  inadequate  response  to  treatment  with  topical 
medications; or determination that  topical treatments are otherwise medically inadvisable”, the 
wording  “or  determination  that  topical  treatments  are  otherwise  medically  inadvisable”  was 
removed, as TCS use was required in the study (per Amendment 1, dated 13 May 2020).  
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 63/209 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Whereas patients  with  prior treatment with dupilumab  or tralokinumab were excluded from the 
KGAB and KGAC studies (exclusion criteria no. 4), patients with  prior dupilumab treatment could 
enroll  into  the  KGAD  study  after  appropriate  washout  (patients  with  prior  treatment  with 
dupilumab within  8 weeks were to be excluded).  
Patients  that  had  had  an  important  side  effect  to  TCS  (e.g.,  intolerance  to  treatment, 
hypersensitivity  reactions, significant  skin  atrophy,  and  systemic  effects),  as  assessed by  the 
investigator or  treating physician  that  would  prevent further use,  were to  be excluded, as TCS 
was required in the study (criterion added per Amendment 1, dated 13 May 2020). 
Treatments   
In each of the pivotal studies (KGAB, KGAC and KGAD), the study drug (lebrikizumab and placebo) was 
supplied  as a sterile  prefilled syringe with  a preassembled needle safety device. Each  prefilled syringe 
was intended for a single 2-mL dose (250 mg) administered subcutaneously.  
KGAB  and KGAC  studies 
The treatment schemes in the KGAB and KGAC studies were identical.   
Induction period 
During  the  16-week induction period, the  patients received lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W  (loading dose of 
500 mg  given at  baseline and week 2)  or placebo Q2W.  All  study drug  injections were administered in 
the clinic. 
Use of rescue  therapy  in the Induction Period 
Use of topical or systemic treatments for AD was prohibited during  the induction  period, unless used as 
a  rescue  therapy. Patients  who  experienced intolerable  AD  symptoms  and  required  rescue treatment 
could be started on topical treatments, such as TCS, and still continue study drug, but were then assigned 
to  the  Escape  Arm  at  Week 16.  If  patients  required  systemic  rescue  treatments,  such  as  oral 
corticosteroids,  phototherapy,  and  cyclosporine, study  drug  was  discontinued,  though  patients  could 
enter the escape arm after a washout period equal to 5 or more half-lives of the medication. 
Maintenance  Period 
During  the  36-week maintenance  period, the  patients  were assigned to  either maintenance  blinded 
period  or maintenance  escape  period  based  on  their  response to  treatment  during  the  induction 
period. Because treatments were administered between visits as well as at visits, patients  were trained 
and instructed to self-administer study drug at home. 
Maintenance  Blinded Period 
After completion of the Week-16 visit, patients who completed the induction period and achieved an IGA 
0,1  or  EASI 75  response, without  the  use  of  rescue therapy, entered  the  maintenance  blinded  period 
and  received  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W,  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q4W  or  placebo.  Responders  who 
received placebo during  the  first  16 weeks  of  study  and  who  were  randomised to  lebrikizumab arms, 
received a loading  dose of lebrikizumab of either  500 mg  at week 16  or  500 mg given  at week 16 and 
18 based on the active treatment group assigned in the maintenance period. 
Maintenance  Escape  Period 
The maintenance escape period included patients who achieved neither IGA 0,1 nor EASI 75 at Week 16, 
received topical  or systemic rescue therapy from baseline to  week 16,  or did  not  maintain  an EASI 50 
response at Week 24, 32, 40, or 48 following rerandomisation to the maintenance blinded period.  
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 64/209 
 
 
 
All patients received open-label lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W through week 52.  
Patients in the  Escape Arm received blinded loading doses based on their prior treatment assignment:  
• 
• 
• 
Patients assigned to the lebrikizumab treatment group in the Induction Period who then entered the 
Escape Arm received 2 injections  at  Week 16  and  Week 18,  i.e.  1  lebrikizumab injection  (250  mg) 
and 1 placebo injection. 
Patients  assigned  to  the  placebo  treatment  group  in  the  Induction  Period  who  then  entered  the 
Escape Arm received 2 lebrikizumab injections (500 mg) at Week 16 and Week 18 
Patients who did not achieve an EASI 50 response after 8 weeks of treatment were terminated from 
the study. 
Use of rescue  therapy  in the Maintenance  Period 
Intermittent  use of  topical rescue medications for AD  was permitted. Patients  who  required short-term 
systemic treatment for symptoms of AD  were assessed on a case-by-case basis and discussed with the 
medical monitor prior to initiating treatment. 
Topical  moisturiser 
All  patients  were  to  use  nonmedicated  topical  moisturiser  daily  during  the  7 days  preceding 
randomisation and throughout the study. 
KGAD  study 
Treatment  period 
During  the 16-week treatment  period, the patients  received lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W (loading dose of 
500 mg given at baseline and week 2) + TCS or placebo Q2W + TCS.  
Concomitant  topical treatment   
All patients were instructed  to use TCS for AD symptoms starting at the Baseline visit (Day 1).  Patients 
were provided with  a mid-potency  TCS (triamcinolone  acetonide 0.1%  cream) and  a  low potency  TCS 
(hydrocortisone 1%  cream) for use on  sensitive skin areas. Patients were allowed to taper or stop  TCS 
use as  needed. If AD  lesions returned  or a patient  experienced AD  exacerbation, TCS treatment  could 
be resumed at  the  patient’s  discretion.  Low  potency  TCI use was  permitted  for use on  sensitive areas 
only,  but  they  were  not  supplied  by  the  study  site.  All  use  of TCS  and  TCI was  recorded daily by  the 
patient using  an electronic diary.  
Rescue  treatment 
Add-on rescue therapies were permitted when a patient experienced clinical worsening of symptoms that 
were  intolerable,  including  high  potency  TCS  or  systemic  treatments,  such  as  oral  corticosteroids, 
phototherapy,  and  cyclosporin.  Study  drug  was  discontinued  for  patients  receiving  systemic  rescue 
treatment,  but  patients  were  still  required  to  attend  all  study  visits  and  be  assessed  for  safety  and 
efficacy according to the schedule of events, even when rescue medication was initiated.  
Topical  moisturiser 
All  patients  were  to  use  nonmedicated  topical  moisturiser  daily  during  the  7 days  preceding 
randomisation. Nonmedicated moisturisers were to be used during the study. The patient  could continue 
her/his current over-the-counter moisturiser regimen, if approved by the Investigator.

Sample size  
KGAB  and KGAC  studies 
In the Phase 2b dose-range finding study (KGAF), the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score 
of 0  or 1 at  Week 16  using  the rescue medication non-response sensitivity  analysis was  approximately 
34.7%  for  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W  versus  7.7%  for  placebo,  and  the  proportion  of  patients  who 
achieved an  EASI-75  at  Week  16  using  the  rescue  medication  non-response  sensitivity  analysis was 
approximately 48.0%  for lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W versus 11.5% for placebo. A sample size of 96  for 
lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W  versus  48  for  placebo  had  more  than  95%  power  to  detect  a  statistically 
significant  difference  based  on  a  two-group  continuity  corrected  chi-square  test  with  a  two-sided 
significance level of 0.05 for each of the co-primary endpoints, which imply and overall power of at least 
90%. However, to ensure sufficient safety information was collected and to ensure sufficient responders 
for the Maintenance  Period, the  sample size was increased to  400 in  total  with  a randomisation ratio  of 
2:1 lebrikizumab:placebo. 
KGAD  study 
Approximately  225  patients  were  to  be  randomised  at  a  2:1  ratio  to  lebrikizumab  or  placebo 
(150  patients:75  patients).  The assumed IGA score of 0  or 1 at  Week 16  response rates were 38%  for 
lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W  and  13%  for  placebo.  The  assumed  EASI  75  response  rate  at  Week  16 
response rates  were  58%  for  lebrikizumab 250  mg  Q2W  and  20%  for  placebo.  The  assumptions  for 
lebrikizumab were based on the  dose-range finding  Phase 2b  study  (KGAF), the  proportion  of patients

who achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 and proportion of patients who achieved EASI75 response at Week 
16  using  the  rescue  medication  non-response  sensitivity  analysis,  adjusting  for  the  allowed  use  of 
TCS/TCI. The placebo response rates were based on the review of historical TCS clinical studies in atopic 
dermatitis.  This  study  had  power  >95%  for testing  superiority of  lebrikizumab  to  placebo based  on a 
two-sided Fisher’s exact test with  alpha of 0.05. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking)  
KGAB,  KGAC  and KGAD studies 
All  patients  were  randomly allocated  to  receive the  study  treatment  using  an  electronic data  capture 
(EDC) system at the Baseline visit. The allocation to treatment was prospectively stratified by geographic 
region (US versus EU versus rest of world), age (adolescent patients 12 to <18 years versus adults  
≥18 years)  and  disease severity  (IGA 3  versus 4).  At  the  Baseline  visit  (Day  1),  once  a  patient  was 
considered eligible to  participate in  the  study,  demographic and  stratification  information  was  entered 
into the  EDC system to receive a medication number assigning a kit to a patient.  
During  the Maintenance Period in KGAB and KGAC studies, the EDC  was used to re-randomise a patient 
to a maintenance treatment based on the IGA or EASI score at Week 16 and rescue therapy usage during 
induction  period. 
The  Sponsor  or  designee,  the  Investigator,  study-site  personnel,  and  the  patient  were  blinded  to 
treatment  assignment.  The  integrity  of  the  clinical  study  was  to  be  maintained  by  observing  the 
treatment blind.  If knowledge of a patient’s treatment  assignment was required for the patient’s clinical 
care and/or safety, the Investigator consulted  with  the Sponsor’s medical monitor prior to  breaking the 
blind. 
Placebo solution was identical in  appearance and content  to the active solution except for lebrikizumab. 
All  study  drug  (lebrikizumab and  placebo) were supplied  as  a sterile  PFS-NSD.  Each  pre-filled syringe 
was used to deliver a single 2-mL dose (250 mg) administered subcutaneously.  
Appropriate combination of active and placebo injections was given to maintain blinding. 
Statistical  methods  
Induction Treatment  Periods in Studies KGAB,  KGAC, and  KGAD 
Primary  and supportive estimands for Induction Periods 
Three types of  prespecified estimands  were used to  address different clinical  questions of  interest and 
ICEs  for  the  Induction  Period.  Two  types  of  ICEs  were considered  for  the  Induction  Period,  including 
initiation  of  rescue  medication,  as  defined  for  the  individual  study,  and  permanent  treatment 
discontinuation.  All estimands of the Induction Period were defined for the patient population as defined 
by the  protocol inclusion  or exclusion criteria. The primary estimand was a  hybrid estimand combining 
composite  strategy  and  hypothetical  strategy  to  handle  ICEs  depending  on  their  causes. The  primary 
estimand  was used  for all  primary and  key secondary endpoints.  Two  supportive estimands  were also 
used, 1 for all categorical endpoints and 1 for all continuous endpoints (Table 15).  
As per the  SAPs, the  primary estimand  is a  hybrid estimand representing the  primary clinical question 
of interest:  “What  is the difference between treatment  conditions, i.e.,  Lebrikizumab vs Placebo, in the 
target  patient  population,  in  successful  responses or  means  after  16  weeks  achieved without  use  of 
rescue medication and if all patients continued with treatment except those who discontinued due to lack 
of efficacy?” 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 68/209 
 
 
 
For  the primary and key secondary analyses conducted relative to  the primary estimand, patients  who 
received topical  rescue  medications  (any  TCS,  TCI,  or  crisaborole for  Study  KGAB  and  Study  KGAC 
patients or only high-potency TCS for Study KGAD patients) or systemic rescue therapies or discontinued 
treatment due to  lack of efficacy had values set to their baseline value subsequent to this time through 
Week 16  which, when  dichotomised, implies non-response; data after treatment discontinuation  due to 
any other  reasons were treated as  missing,  and all  the  missing  data  were  imputed  with  the  MCMC-MI 
method.  The  MCMC-MI  method  takes  into  account  each  patient’s  own  data  trajectory and  leverages 
information from other patients within  the same treatment (including the afore-mentioned imputed data 
according  patients’  baseline  values)  to  impute  plausible  values  for  the  missing  data:  Twenty-five 
imputations  were  conducted  within  each  treatment  group  independently  so  the  pattern  of  missing 
observations in  one treatment  group cannot  influence missing  value imputation  in another.  IGA scores 
were rounded to  (0,  1,  2,  3, or  4) from the  continuous  values generated by the  MCMC  algorithm  after 
which IGA (0,1)  response derived based on the rounded values. For derivation of an EASI-75 and EASI-
90 response, no rounding will be performed. 
Table 15:  Description of Primary and Supportive Estimands  
In  D120  LoQ,  a  set  of  supplementary  analyses was  requested  in  accordance with  ITT  principle,  i.e., 
treatment policy estimand for which observed data are used regardless of any intercurrent events. Any 
data  that  remained missing  was  imputed  using  MCMC-MI  even if  the  Applicant  was requested  to  use 
imputation  strategy  that  considers  what  is  known  about  the  subjects’  status  with  respect  to  these 
intercurrent  events.  The  results  of  these  supplementary  analyses  are  presented  for  the  co-primary 
endpoints and also for DLQI because of the considerable impact of the analysis strategy on the results.  
For the  pivotal Phase 3 studies,  a prespecified graphical multiple testing  approach was implemented to 
control the overall Type I error rate at 2-sided alpha of 0.05 for all primary and key secondary endpoints 
in  the  16-week  treatment  periods. The  primary and  key secondary endpoints  for  the  pivotal  Phase 3 
studies differed between US and EU based on regulator requests. The graphical testing scheme used for 
Study  KGAB and  Study  KGAC for  EMA  is provided in Figure  9.  The  graphical testing  scheme for Study 
KGAD FOR EMA is provided in Figure 10.

The  CSR’s  report  observed  results  excluding  data  collected  after  rescue  medication  or  treatment 
discontinuation. In addition, in line with the estimand definitions (Table 15), for dichotomised endpoints, 
response  rates  and, 
for  quantitative  endpoints,  LS  means  were  presented  following  data 
handling/imputation  rules  as  specified  below.  Treatment  effect  estimates  were,  for  dichotomised 
endpoints, based on stratified difference in the proportion of responders and, for quantitative endpoints, 
based on an ANCOVA model as further specified below. 
Analysis models 
For  the  dichotomised  endpoints,  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  test  was  used  for  testing  the  null 
hypothesis of no  treatment effect, stratified  by randomisation strata:  geographic region (US  versus EU 
versus rest of world), age (adolescent patients 12 to <18 versus adults >=18 years) and disease severity 
(IGA 3  versus 4).  The  difference in  the  proportion of  responders was  also estimated  with  stratification 
by  the  randomisation  strata.  The  confidence  intervals  were  calculated  using  Mantel-Haenszel-Sato 
method. [NB: In the study reports, the  above-mentioned stratified analyses are referred to as CMH test 
and common  risk difference “adjusted”  by geographic region (US versus EU  versus rest  of world),  age 
(adolescent versus adult), and disease severity (IGA 3 versus 4).] 
For  the  quantitative  endpoints,  an  ANCOVA model was  applied including  treatment,  geographic region 
(US  vs EU  vs rest of  the world),  age group  (adolescent patients  12  to  <18  versus adults  >=18  years) 
and baseline IGA score (3,4) as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate. The analysis results were 
combined across all  multiply  imputed  datasets using  SAS procedure MIANALYZE.  In  response to  D120 
LoQ, the Applicant clarified that for estimation of treatment-arm specific LS means, the default covariate 
weights  of  the  respective SAS procedure were used.  These imply  a target  population  where  a third  of 
patients are from each region, half are adolescents and half have IGA of 3.

Maintenance  Periods in Study KGAB  and Study  KGAC 
Primary  and supportive estimands for Maintenance  Periods 
Four  types  of  estimands  were used  to  address different  clinical  questions  of  interest  and  ICEs for  the 
Maintenance  Period.  These  four  estimands  were  defined  for  the  Maintenance  Populations  in  the 
Maintenance Blinded Period (Table 16). 
The maintenance primary estimand was used for all key secondary endpoints for the Maintenance 
Period. Three secondary maintenance estimands were also used: 
• 
• 
• 
a hybrid estimand for all key and other secondary endpoints 
a composite estimand for all key and other secondary categorical endpoints, and 
a hypothetical estimand for all key and other secondary continuous endpoints 
Three types of ICEs were used to estimate the treatment effects for Maintenance Period, including 
• 
• 
• 
initiation  of rescue medication 
permanent treatment discontinuation,  and 
transfer to escape arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023

For the  Maintenance Week 16 Escape Population, results were reported for efficacy analyses performed 
using  observed values at  each time point,  with  no  imputation  for missing  values. In addition,  a  hybrid 
estimand  considering  permanent  treatment  discontinuation  as  the  only  ICE  is  also  reported  as  a 
supportive analysis.

Multiplicity  control for Maintenance  Period 
For  the  Maintenance  Period  of  Study  KGAB  and  Study  KGAC,  a  multiplicity  testing  scheme  was 
implemented  which  used  alpha  control  with  a  family-wise error  rate  at  0.05.  The  hierarchical  testing 
scheme is provided in Table 16.

Use of Study KGAB  and Study KGAC Pooled Data 
Data  from  Study  KGAB and  Study  KGAC were  pooled  where  applicable. This  pooled  analysis set  was 
prespecified in  the  integrated  efficacy analysis  plan. Study  KGAB and  Study  KGAC had  identical  study 
designs, which enabled the creation of these pooled populations. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subpopulation  analyses  were  performed  to  examine  how  patient  baseline  demographic,  disease 
characteristics,  or  treatment  history  affects  response  to  treatment  with  lebrikizumab.  All  subgroup 
analyses were performed on data pooled from Study KGAB and Study KGAC. 
Induction Period 
Subgroup analyses for the  Induction Period were conducted using the Pooled Induction set, which is the 
combination of patients from Study KGAB and Study KGAC. Subgroup analyses were conducted relative 
to primary estimand (hybrid), comparing the lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W treatment group to placebo. 
Effect modification by subgroups on odds ratio scale was evaluated using  logistic regression including a 
treatment by subgroup interaction term. Treatment group differences in responder rates were evaluated 
within  each subgroup using  the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH)  test  stratified by study  (KGAB, KGAC; 
but  not  by  randomisation  strata  within  study)  regardless of  whether  the  interaction  was  statistically 
significant. 
Maintenance Period 
Subgroup analyses for the Maintenance  Period were conducted in  the Pooled Maintenance Primary Set, 
which  is  the  combination  of  patients  from  Study  KGAB  and  Study  KGAC.  Subgroup  analyses  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023

conducted  relative  to  maintenance  primary  estimand  (hybrid),  comparing  the  treatment  group  re-
randomised to  lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W  to those re-randomised to placebo (lebrikizumab withdrawal) 
and the treatment group re-randomised to lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W to those re-randomised to placebo 
(lebrikizumab withdrawal). 
Analyses for Efficacy  Outcomes  for Study KGAD  Patients  in Study KGAA 
Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the efficacy results from Study KGAA. The efficacy analyses 
were  conducted  relative  to  the  primary  estimand  as  defined  in  the  study.  No  statistical  tests  were 
performed. 
Primary and supportive estimands of efficacy objectives 
Three types  of  estimands  were  used to  handle  missing  data  in  analyses of  Study  KGAA. The  primary 
estimand  was used for all  efficacy endpoints.  Two  supportive estimands were also used  for all efficacy 
endpoints. Table 18 summarises the primary and supportive estimands used in the Study KGAA analyses. 
Treatment discontinuation, whether due to lack of efficacy or any other reason, was the only intercurrent 
event considered in the estimation of the treatment effect in Study KGAA.

Conduct of the study  
Site exclusion   
Following  primary outcome database lock, a site audit  triggered by statistically  implausible data at  one 
study  site  resulted in  a critical  finding.  The  site audit  revealed GCP noncompliance with  protocol  entry 
criteria  and  the  associated efficacy data  was  considered unreliable.  The  site  was  closed  for  all  active 
lebrikizumab studies.  As a result, the  patients from the affected study site with  the critical finding  were 
excluded from the modified intent-to-treat  (mITT) population and the Modified Safety population for the 
KGAC  and  KGAD  studies.  In  total,  35  patients  were  excluded,  18  from  Study  KGAC  and  17  from 
Study KGAD. According to the Applicant, due to the unreliable baseline AD  values, any efficacy analyses 
performed on the data of these patients would lead to inconclusive and unreliable results. For this reason,

secondary endpoint. In KGAB study, 12.4% vs. 1.6% of the patients in lebrikizumab and placebo groups, 
respectively, achieved EASI  90  at  Week 4  resulting  in  a  treatment  difference  of  10.7%  (p<0.001).  In 
KGAC study,  6.3% vs. 1.5%  of the patients  in lebrikizumab and placebo groups, respectively, achieved 
EASI 90 at Week 4 with a treatment difference of 4.9% (p=0.023). 
Percentage  change  in EASI score from Baseline  to Week  16 
In  KGAB  and  KGAC,  the  percentage  change  (LSM)  in  EASI  score  was  -64.31%  and  -61.5%  in 
lebrikizumab groups and -26.01% and -28.0% in placebo groups at Week 16 (p<0.001 in both studies). 
In KGAD, the corresponding change was -76.8%  in lebrikizumab + TCS group and -53.1%  in placebo + 
TCS group (p<0.001).  The decrease in EASI score with  lebrikizumab reached statistical  significance vs. 
placebo from week 2 onwards in KGAB and KGAC studies, and from week 4 onwards in KGAD study.  
Percentage  of patients  with a  Pruritus  NRS  of ≥4-points at  Baseline  who achieve  a  ≥4-point 
reduction  from Baseline  to Week  16 
In KGAB and KGAC, 45.9%  and  39.8%  of patients  treated with  lebrikizumab and 13.0%  and 11.5%  of 
patients  treated with  placebo achieved a ≥4 reduction  in NRS at  Week 16  (p<0.001).  In KGAD,  50.6% 
of patients  treated with  lebrikizumab + TCS and 31.9%  of patients treated with placebo + TCS achieved 
a  ≥4  reduction  in  NRS  at  Week  16  (p<0.017).  The  treatment  difference  between  lebrikizumab  and 
placebo was  32.9%  and  28.3%  in  KGAB and KGAC, respectively, and  19.2%  in  KGAD  where TCS was 
used. A statistically  significant  difference between  lebrikizumab vs. placebo was reached from 2 weeks

Key  secondary  endpoints specific for maintenance  period: 
Percentage  of patients  from those  re-randomised  having  achieved  EASI-75 at Week  16  who 
continue  to exhibit EASI-75 at Week  52 (EASI-75 calculated  relative  to baseline  EASI score) 
Lebrikizumab-responders who were re-randomised to  treatment with  lebrikizumab maintained EASI 75 
response  at  Week  52  at  numerically  higher  rates  compared  with  those  who  were  re-randomised  to 
placebo (lebrikizumab withdrawal) (Table 37). Among patients in the pooled population, maintenance of 
EASI 75  was higher  at  Week  52  for  patients  re-randomised to  lebrikizumab  250 mg  Q4W  (81.7%)  or 
lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W  (78.4%)  compared  to  those  re-randomised  to  placebo  (lebrikizumab 
withdrawal)  (66.4%).  
Overall, the  rates of maintenance of EASI 75 at  Week 52  and throughout  the  Maintenance Period were 
similar for patients re-randomised to either lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W or Q2W, although  in Study KGAC 
the  percentage  of  patients  maintaining  EASI  75  was  numerically  higher  in  the  group  treated  with

Lebrikizumab-responders who were re-randomised to  treatment  with  lebrikizumab maintained Pruritus 
NRS  4-point  improvement  at  Week 52  at  numerically higher  rates compared with  those who  were  re-
randomised to  placebo (lebrikizumab withdrawal) (Table 39).  Among patients in  the pooled population, 
approximately  85%  of  patients  treated  with  lebrikizumab  250  mg,  either  Q4W  or  Q2W,  maintained 
Pruritus NRS 4-point improvement at Week 52, whereas 66.3%  of patients in the placebo (lebrikizumab 
withdrawal)  group maintained this response at Week 52. 
Overall, the rates of maintenance of Pruritus NRS 4-point improvement were similar for patients treated 
with  either lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W or Q2W.

Lebrikizumab  responders  who  were  randomly  reassigned  to  lebrikizumab  Q4W  or  Q2W  maintained 
numerically  higher  mean  percentage  improvement  from  Baseline  in  EASI  response  up  to  Week  52 
compared with  responders who  were randomly reassigned to  placebo (lebrikizumab withdrawal)  (Table 
40 and Table 41).

For the  above-mentioned endpoints for Maintenance Period (EASI 75;  IGA 0, 1; Pruritus  NRS ≥4-Point 
Improvement and  EASI percent change from baseline)  the results  remained consistent  when analysed 
according  to  the  Maintenance  Supportive  Estimand  (hybrid), i.e.,  including  data  regardless of  topical 
rescue medication use. 
Other  Secondary  Endpoints Specific for Maintenance  Period 
Among  lebrikizumab-responders with  EASI 75  at  Week 16,  proportions  of  patients  achieving  EASI 90 
increased from Week 16 to  Week 52 for groups re-randomised to  treatment  with  lebrikizumab 250 mg 
Q4W  or  Q2W,  while  proportions  of  patients  achieving EASI  90  decreased in  groups  re-randomised to 
placebo (lebrikizumab withdrawal). In the pooled population, 66.4% of patients treated Q4W and 64.0% 
of patients treated Q2W achieved EASI 90 at Week 52,  compared with 41.9%  of patients  in the placebo 
(lebrikizumab withdrawal) group.

Rescue  medications 
KGAB  study 
The most commonly used rescue treatment during both the  Induction and Maintenance Blinded Periods 
was  TCS  (Table 43  and  Table 44).  During  the  Induction  Period,  29.8%  of  the  patients  in  the  placebo 
group vs. 8.5% in the lebrikizumab group used TCS.  
Table 43:  Summary of AD Rescue therapy Induction Period (ITT Population)  
Time to use of rescue therapy 
Patients randomised to lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W demonstrated a 73% reduction in the risk of initiating 
rescue therapy during  the Induction  Period compared to  patients  given placebo in Study  KGAB (hazard 
ratio: 0.27,  95% CI: 0.17 to 0.42)

In the Week 16 escape arm of the KGAB study (Week 16 to 52), any rescue therapy was used by: 
•  40.6%  of patients entering the escape arm from the Induction Period placebo arm (PBO/LEB), and 
•  24.5%  of those entering from the Induction Period lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W arm (LEB/LEB) 
Topical  rescue  therapy  was  used  by  35.4%  (PBO/LEB)  and  23.6%  (LEB/LEB),  and  systemic  rescue 
therapy by 5.2% (PBO/LEB) and 2.8% (LEB/LEB), respectively. 
KGAC  study 
The most commonly used rescue treatment during both the  Induction and Maintenance Blinded Periods 
was TCS (Table 45 and Table 46). During  the Induction Period, 37% of the patients in the placebo group 
vs. 16.7% in the  lebrikizumab group used TCS. 
Table 45:  Summary of AD Rescue therapy Induction Period (mITT Population)  
Time to first use of rescue therapy 
Patients randomised to lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W demonstrated a 65% reduction in the risk of initiating

Table 46:  Summary of AD Rescue therapy Maintenance  Blinded Period (Modified 
Maintenance  Primary Population)  
In the Week 16 Escape Arm of the KGAC study (Week 16 to 52), any rescue therapy was used by 
•  43.5%  of patients entering the escape arm from the Induction Period placebo arm (PBO/LEB), and 
•  32% of those entering from the Induction Period lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W arm (LEB/LEB) 
Topical rescue therapy was used by 40.7% (PBO/LEB) and 32% (LEB/LEB), and systemic rescue therapy 
by 3.7% (PBO/LEB) and 2.4% (LEB/LEB),  respectively. 
KGAD  study 
In Study KGAD, which allowed use of low-to-mid-potency TCS and TCI by all patients, smaller proportions 
of patients in either treatment group used rescue therapy compared to the monotherapy studies. A total 
of 7 (10.6%)  placebo-treated patients required 1 or more rescue therapies during the study, and rescue 
therapy was used by 6 (4.1%) lebrikizumab-treated patients (Table 47).

Topical corticosteroids 
All patients  in  Study  KGAD were required to  use TCS at  the  start  of the  trial.  Patients  were allowed to 
taper, stop,  and  restart use  as needed throughout  the  16  weeks of the  trial.  Data  from both  the  CRFs 
and patient diaries showed percentages of TCS use close to 100%. The 2 most commonly used TCS were 
triamcinolone and hydrocortisone, which were the products supplied by the study sites (Table 48). 
Topical calcineurin inhibitors 
TCI were permitted for use on sensitive areas only, but they were not supplied by the study sites. While 
case report form data showed similar rates of use between treatment groups, patient diary data indicated 
that  a greater percentage of lebrikizumab-treated patients used TCI (Table 48).

Treatment Groups 
The study comprises 2 treatment periods: 
• 
Induction: Participants  were randomly assigned 2:1 to LEB 500 mg loading dose 
at baseline and Week 2 then 250 mg Q2W or PBO. 
•  Maintenance: Participants who  were LEB responders were randomly assigned 
2:2:1 to LEB 250 mg Q2W, LEB 250 mg Q4W, or PBO (LEB withdrawal).  
• 
Participants who achieved neither IGA 0,1 nor EASI 75 at Week 16 or who 
received rescue therapy from Baseline to Week 16 were assigned to an escape 
arm and received LEB 250 mg Q2W (following blinded 500 mg loading dose at 
Weeks 16 and 18 for participants who received PBO during Induction) as an open-
label treatment through Week 52.

Two families for alpha control were defined: 1 for induction and 1 for maintenance with each 
family-wise error  rate  at 0.05.  For  all  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  for  Induction 
Period, a  prespecified graphical  multiple testing  approach  was  implemented to  control  the 
overall  Type  I  error  rate  at  2-sided  alpha  of  0.05.  For  all  maintenance  key  secondary  
endpoints,  a  hierarchal  testing  scheme  with a  prespecified  order  was  implemented with  a 
family-wise error rate at 0.05.

a Primary estimand (hybrid), CMH-MCMC-MI: Participants who received any topical or systemic rescue medication, or 
discontinued  treatment due to lack of efficacy had values set to their baseline value after this time through  Week 16; 
MCMC-MI  was  used  to handle  the  remaining missing  data. CMH test  stratified by  geographic  region,  age  group,  and 
baseline IGA. 
b  Primary  estimand  (hybrid),  ANCOVA  with  MCMC-MI:  Participants  who  received  any  topical  or  systemic  rescue 
medication, or  discontinued  treatment  due  to  lack  of efficacy had  values  set  to  their  baseline  value  after  this  time 
through  Week 16; MCMC-MI  was  used  to handle the  remaining missing  data. ANCOVA model adjusted  for treatment 
group, baseline value, geographic region, age group, and baseline IGA.  
c  Supportive  estimand  (hypothetical),  MMRM:  Data  after  topical  or  systemic  rescue  medication  or  treatment 
discontinuation were treated as missing and missing data were handled by MMRM. The MMRM model includes treatment, 
baseline  value,  visit,  the  interaction  of  the  baseline  value-by-visit, the  interaction  of  treatment-by-visit, and  the 
stratification factors as fixed factors. 
d  Maintenance  primary  estimand  (hybrid),  CMH-MCMC-MI:  Participants  who  received  systemic  rescue  medication, 
discontinued  treatment due to lack of efficacy, or transferred to escape arm had values set to their baseline value after 
this time through  Week 52; participants who received topical rescue medication or discontinued treatment due to other 
reasons  had  values set  to missing; MCMC-MI  was  used  to handle  the remaining missing  data. CMH test stratified by 
geographic  region.

Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. 
This study had a single treatment period of 16 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned 
at a ratio of 2:1 to LEB 500 mg loading dose at baseline and Week 2 then 250 mg Q2W or 
PBO. Participants were required to use TCS at baseline and then were allowed to use as 
needed for the duration of the study.  
Treatment 
PBO + TCS 
Randomised N = 75 
Groups 
4 mL was administered via 2 preassembled needle safety 
devices (PFS-NSD) at baseline and Week 2 and 2 mL Q2W 
was administered through  Week 14 via 1 PFS-NSD. TCS 
treatment was initiated at baseline and applied as needed.  
LEB 250 mg Q2W + TCS 
Randomised N = 153 
LEB 500 mg at baseline and Week 2 (loading dose) and 
250  mg given Q2W through Week 14 with TCS treatment 
initiated at baseline and applied as needed.

Study KGAE (J2T-DM-KGAE  or ADore) 
KGAE was a 52 week, open-label, single-arm study  to assess the  safety and  efficacy of lebrikizumab in 
adolescent patients  (≥12  years to  less than  18  years, weighing  ≥40  kg)  with  moderate-to-severe AD. 
The patients were to  have a chronic AD  for at least 1 year and key inclusion criteria included EASI ≥16, 
IGA score ≥3, BSA ≥10% and been a candidate for systemic therapy.  
At  baseline  and  Week  2,  all  patients  were  administered  subcutaneously  a  loading  dose  of  500  mg 
lebrikizumab. From Week 4 onwards, all patients were administered 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W through 
Week 52 subcutaneously.  
The  use  of  any  potency  TCS,  TCIs  and  PDE4  inhibitors  were  permitted  to  be  used  as  add-on  rescue 
treatment  when  a  patient  experienced clinical  worsening  of  symptoms that  were  intolerable.  Patients 
who required short-term systemic treatment for symptoms of AD were assessed on a case-by-case basis 
by the investigator. Patients who required long-term systemic treatment for symptoms of AD (e.g., non-
responders) were discontinued from the study as per the protocol requirements. 
A  posttreatment  follow-up  visit  was  conducted  approximately 12  weeks after  the  last  injection  of  the 
study  drug  for  patients  who  had  discontinued  early from  the  study  or  completed  participation  in  the 
Open-Label Treatment Period and did not wish to enter the long-term extension study (KGAA). 
Efficacy results 
Altogether 206  received study treatment. All efficacy measures were included as secondary endpoints in 
the Study KGAE study design. The results are summarised below (Table 54).

Participants  were  randomly assigned  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive either  lebrikizumab  (a  loading  dose  of 
500 mg administered at baseline and Week 2, and 250 mg Q2W thereafter through Week 14) or placebo. 
At Week 12, after the predose blood sample vaccine titres were withdrawn, 1 dose of each of the following 
2  commercially available vaccines were administered  to  all  participants  still  on  study  drug:  Diphtheria 
and  Tetanus  Toxoids  and  Acellular  Pertussis  Vaccine  Adsorbed  (Sanofi)  (Tdap),  and  Meningococcal 
(Groups A, C, Y, and W-135)  Oligosaccharide Diphtheria  CRM197  Conjugate Vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline) 
(MCV). The antibody titres were determined 4 weeks later (Figure 18).

Usability of the autoinjector  and PFS-NSD  – Human factor  studies 
For  the  autoinjector  a  use-related  risk  assessment,  usability  studies  and  HF  validation  testing  was 
performed. The  HFE  of  PFS-NSD  presentation  of  lebrikizumab  included  an  exploratory human  factors 
study and a threshold analysis.  
The  Applicant  also  conducted  a  known  problems  analysis  to  identify  use-related  problems  that  have 
occurred  with  products  that  are  comparable to  the  lebrikizumab  autoinjector  and  PFS-NSD.  Findings 
were identified  and  compiled from  multiple  sources, including  device constituent  manufacturer known 
use  problems, clinical  evaluation reports,  complaint  data from  clinical  trials,  engineering evaluation  of 
returned products, risk analyses, and predicate device human factors studies. 
The lebrikizumab autoinjector was found to fulfil the usability needs of the intended users and the study 
results supported the safe and effective use of the PFP. All use problems observed were already identified 
in  the  use-related  risk analysis  and  are  known  use  problems. No  new  or  unanticipated  use  problems 
were observed. 
Based on the  results of the  Final  Formative Human  Factors  Study #2  (RTP-814408)  and  the validation 
protocol advice from FDA the Applicant decided to exclude adolescent patients from the group of intended 
users for self-injection in the human  factors study and stated that  the  adolescent patients must  receive 
injections from a caregiver or HCP. This was because untrained adolescent user (without  assistance from 
a guardian) represented a high-risk scenario and also overdosing errors were made by three adolescents 
in  the  formative  studies.  However,  the  PI  texts  in  and  PL  differ  from  this  stating  that  it  is  only 
recommended that lebrikizumab is administered by or under supervision of an adult  and the healthcare 
professional determines if  self-injection is  appropriate. The  Applicant  has adequately  justified  that  the 
commercial  settings  differ  from  the  human  factor  study  settings  and  adolescent  patients  or  their 
caregivers will  receive instructions  on  the  dose  regimen  and  training  in  the  use  of  the  device  by  a 
healthcare provider prior to  use.  Therefore it  is  reasonable to  assume that  adolescents will  be  able to 
appropriately administer the drug under adult supervision.  
The  Applicant  has  adequately assessed the  use-related risk  of  the  lebrikizumab  PFS-NSD  through  the 
HFE  process and was found to fulfil the usability needs of the intended users.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
The clinical program of lebrikizumab in  moderate-to-severe AD consists of 3 pivotal studies,  evaluating 
efficacy  of  lebrikizumab  as  monotherapy  (studies  KGAB  and  KGAC)  or  in  combination  with  TCS 
(study KGAD).  
The  finally  agreed  indication  for  lebrikizumab  is  as  follows:  “Lebrikizumab  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment  of  moderate-to-severe  atopic  dermatitis  in  adults  and  adolescents  12  years  and 
older  with  a  body  weight  of at  least  40  kg  who  are  candidates  for  systemic  therapy”.  SmPC 
further states that lebrikizumab can be used with  or without  TCS or TCI: “Lebrikizumab can be used with 
or without  topical corticosteroids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors  may be used, but  should be reserved for 
problem  areas  only,  such  as  the  face,  neck,  intertriginous  and  genital  areas”.  The  initially  proposed 
indication did not  include body weight restriction,  but was later modified upon CHMP’s request, as there 
was no clinical data in patients with  a body weight < 40 kg. 
The Applicant sought  SA from EMA initially  in 2013  (EMA/CHMP/15140/2013)  and follow-up SA in  2016 
(EMA/CHMP/24061/2017).  At the time of the initial advice in 2013, no studies in AD had been conducted 
and e.g. protocol(s) for Phase 3 studies were not available. After the initial EMA SA, the Applicant’s plans 
evolved substantially.  Further,  at  the  time  of  the  follow-up  SA  (EMA/CHMP/24061/2017),  only results 
from the initial  Phase 2 studies KGAG (TREBLE) and KGAH (URBAN) were available, and the plans of the 
Phase 3 pivotal studies were further modified after completion of the Phase 2b dose-range finding study 
(KGAF).  In  general, however, it  can  be concluded  that  no discrepancies between  the  EMA  SA and  the 
conducted Phase 3 studies are identified that would be critical for an adequate assessment of the efficacy 
of lebrikizumab in moderate-to-severe AD. 
Overall, the  extent of  the clinical program seems adequate for evaluation of efficacy of  lebrikizumab in 
moderate-to-severe AD in adults and adolescents. 
Design and conduct  of clinical studies 
Pivotal studies KGAB  KGAC and  KGAD 
Study design and treatments 
KGAB and KGAC studies were similar in design and consisted of 16-week induction period where subjects 
were randomly assigned 2:1  to  lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W  (with  a  loading dose of  500  mg at  baseline 
and  week  2)  or  placebo, and  36-week  maintenance  treatment  period where  the  responders from  the 
16-week induction  period (i.e. patients  achieving IGA score of 0 or 1,  or EASI 75, and not receiving any 
rescue treatment)  were  re-randomised 2:2:1  to  lebrikizumab 250  mg  Q2W,  250  mg  Q4W  or  placebo 
(maintenance  blinded period).  Non-responders or subjects  who  required rescue medication  during  the 
induction  period,  were enrolled  into  escape arm  receiving  open-label  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W  until 
week 52  (maintenance escape period). Rescue medication during  induction  period included any topical 
or  systemic  medication.  TCSs  were  prohibited  during  the  induction  period  (unless  used  as  a  rescue 
therapy)  but  permitted  intermittently  during  the  maintenance  period.  Patients  using  TCS as  a  rescue 
therapy  during  the  induction  period  could  continue  using  study  drug  until  Week  16  but  were  then 
assigned to Escape arm. On the other hand, patients using systemic rescue therapy during the Induction 
period, discontinued the study drug, but could enter the Escape arm after appropriate washout.  
In KGAD  study,  patients  were randomised 2:1  to  receive lebrikizumab 250  mg (with  a loading  dose of 
500 mg at baseline and week 2) + TCS or placebo + TCS for 16 weeks. Low-  and mid-potency TCS was 
Assessment report

Page 148/209 
 
 
 
provided to  be used  as needed. The  use of  low  potency TCI also  permitted  in  sensitive areas, but  not 
supplied by the study site. 
Overall, the  study designs for the  3 pivotal studies were appropriate. In terms of lebrikizumab doses in 
the  pivotal  studies,  the  data  from  the  16-week  Phase  2b  study  KGAF  supported  selection  of  the 
lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W (with  the 500 mg loading doses at weeks 0 and week 2) as the induction dose 
(weeks  0-16)  for  the  Phase  3  studies.  The  results  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  showed  a  dose-
dependent,  statistically  significant  reduction in  EASI scores from baseline to  Week 16.  The reductions, 
i.e. LS mean percentage change (SD)  in EASI, were observed in the 250 mg Q2W −72.09% (37.229%), 
250  mg  Q4W  −69.21%  (38.282%)  and  in  125  mg Q4W  −62.34%  (37.266%).  Given the  fact  that  the 
250 mg Q4W dose (with  baseline loading dose of 500 mg) demonstrated statistically significant efficacy 
in terms of the primary and several secondary endpoints, the Applicant selected both 250 mg Q2W and 
Q4W  as  maintenance doses in  Phase  3  to  determine whether  a  lower dosing  frequency was  adequate 
once  response was  achieved, or  whether  the  induction  dosing  frequency should  be  continued,  which 
seems well justified. Despite the lack of active comparator, the  design of the pivotal study is considered 
acceptable by CHMP to characterise the efficacy profile of lebrikizumab in AD. 
In  terms  of  concomitant  medications,  e.g.  use  of  anti-histamines,  the  complete  list  of  permitted 
concomitant  treatments  was  initially  not  found  in  the  submitted  dossier.  Upon  CHMP’s  request,  the 
Applicant  provided  the  full  list.  It  seemed  that  many  participants  used  the  prohibited,  rescue  or 
intermittent  corticosteroid treatments  during  induction  and  maintenance  periods of  the  studies  KGAB 
and KGAC. Upon  request, the  Applicant further  confirmed that  the protocols were strictly  followed, i.e. 
that  concomitant  treatments  were  recorded  as  protocol  deviations  or  that  the  study  drug  was 
discontinued per protocol where applicable.  
Study population 
The eligibility  criteria for the  KGAB and  KGAC studies  were identical. The enrolled patients  were adults 
or adolescents ≥12  to <18 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg with chronic AD that had been present for 
≥1 year (according to American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria), and been a candidate for 
systemic therapy. The AD  was defined as moderate-to-severe at baseline by EASI score ≥16, IGA score 
≥3 and ≥10% BSA of AD involvement, which can be supported. The patients were to apply a stable dose 
of  non-medicated  topical  moisturiser  daily  throughout  the  study.  Overall,  the  inclusion  criteria  were 
appropriate for  an  AD  study.  The  enrolled  patients  were  to  have a  history  of  inadequate  response to 
treatment  with  topical  medications;  or  determination  that  topical  treatments  are  otherwise  medically 
inadvisable.  In  terms  of  the  key exclusion  criteria,  patients  using  topical  medication,  including  TCSs, 
TCIs,  PDE4 
inhibitors  or  prescription  moisturisers,  as  well  as  systemic  medication,  e.g. 
immunosuppressive/immunomodulating  agents,  phototherapy/photochemotherapy  or  biologics  were 
excluded from the  study. Otherwise, the  exclusion criteria were mostly related to safety of the patients. 
Overall, the  eligibility  criteria in  the KGAB and KGAC studies  are acceptable. Some of the  inclusion and 
exclusion  criteria  were  amended  during  the  study.  However,  the  changes  were  mostly  minor 
clarifications, and it seems unlikely that the changes had relevant impact on the study conduct.  
The eligibility criteria for the KGAD study were identical to the KGAB and KGAC studies in terms of patient 
population  (adults  and  adolescents) and  criteria of  moderate-to-severe AD  (chronic AD  present  for at 
least 1 year (according to American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria), EASI score ≥16, IGA 
score ≥3  and  ≥10%  BSA), as well  as most of  the other  criteria. In the  KGAD study, however, patients 
with  prior exposure to dupilumab  could enter the  study after 8 weeks washout. Further,  some eligibility 
criteria due  to  the  concomitant  use of  TCS in  the  KGAD  study  differed from the  monotherapy studies, 
e.g. patients with  important side effects to TCS were excluded from the study.

Endpoints  
The co-primary endpoints  of all  three pivotal phase 3 studies  KGAB, KGAC and KGAD were percentage 
of patients with  an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a reduction ≥2 points from baseline to Week 16, and patients 
achieving EASI 75 at  Week 16.  These endpoints measure the same domain (improvement in  extent  of 
AD on skin), are widely used, aligned with the CHMP SA and acceptable. Both measures are dichotomised 
derivatives of the actual scales used, IGA and EASI.  
Several key secondary, as  well  as  other  (secondary)  efficacy  endpoints  were  included  in  the  studies. 
These  endpoints  can  be  considered  relevant  efficacy  endpoints  for  AD,  including  the  used  patient-
reported outcome measures, i.e., DLQI, POEM and PROMIS.  
Two new  PROs to provide additional daily data  on symptoms of AD  were incorporated into the  studies, 
i.e., Pruritus NRS and Sleep-Loss Scale. The former asks about worst itching during the last 24 hours on 
a scale from  0 to  10,  while  Sleep-Loss Scale concerns the  level of interference of itching  on sleep last 
night  on a likert scale: 0= not at all, 1=  a little,  2=  moderately, 3= quite a bit,  and 4= unable to sleep. 
The psychometric validation of these assessments has been completed and is described in separate PRO 
dossiers. Both measures are single-item  and included  in the  daily electronic diary. The validation  work 
based on the Phase 2b trial  as well as the  data analysis in Phase 3 studies is  based on  weekly average 
scores that are calculated if data from at least 1 of the 7 prior days was provided by the subject.  
Sample size 
The  sample  size  assumptions  were  informed  by  the  results  of  the  Phase  2b  dose-ranging  and  well 
applicable  to  the  then  planned  phase  3  studies.  For  KGAD,  reasonable adjustments  were  made  the 
expected  response  rates  due  to  the  concomitant  use  of  TCS.  Each  of  the  studies  were  more  than 
sufficiently  powered for  detecting  a clinically relevant difference in  efficacy of  the  induction  treatment. 
The chosen sample size was driven by the need to collect sufficient  safety data and to  ensure sufficient 
responders for the Maintenance Period which is acceptable. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation  by  strata  defined  by  three  factors  representing  geography,  a  demographic  factor 
(adolescent patients  12 to <18  years versus adults ≥18 years) and disease severity (IGA 3 versus 4) is 
conventional  and  acceptable.  The  three  factors  generate  3  x  2  x  2  =  12  randomisation  lists  and, 
inevitably, few subjects will enter a study from some of the  strata. As such the procedure is acceptable 
if  the  stratification  information  is  adequately  taken  into  account  in  the  data  analysis.  The  primary 
analyses  for  the  dichotomised  co-primary  endpoints  are  fully  stratified  such  that  comparisons  are 
performed within  each of the 12 strata and then combined with  a specified weighing method. According 
to the protocol, the quantitative  variables were to be analysed somewhat analogously by including  each 
stratification  strata in  an ANCOVA model, however, this  was turned  into  a conventional data modelling 
approach including  a main effect for each stratification  level in the  model. While model used appears to 
deviate  somewhat  from the  model that  was  pre-stated,  it  is  conventional  and  in  accordance with  the 
EMA Guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical trials (EMA/CHMP/295050/2013). 
Blinding 
The  standard  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  experimental  setting  applied  in  all  of  the  three  main 
studies is considered adequate for isolating the pharmacological effect of the IMP on signs and symptoms 
of  AD.  The active  and placebo PFS’s  were identical  in  appearance. Furthermore, lebrikizumab was  not 
associated with immediate side-effects that would risk the blinding.  
In  studies KGAB and  KGAC, during  the  maintenance period,  patients  that  reached EASI 75  or IGA 0,1 
response  at  Week  16,  were  re-randomised  to  placebo  (withdrawal)  or  lebrikizumab  at  Q2W  or  Q4W 
dosing frequency. Blinding to the treatment assignments during the initial  16 weeks and that during the 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 150/209 
 
 
 
maintenance period was ensured by using  placebo dummies as needed: to  mimic loading doses and to 
mask the  difference between  withdrawal,  reduced dosing frequency (Q4W)  and continued  Q2W  during 
the maintenance period. Also, for those that  entered the Escape arm at Week 16 or later, blinding  of the 
previous treatment  assignment  was ensured by  using,  as applicable,  dummy loading  doses. However, 
the escape treatment of lebrikizumab Q2W was known. 
The blinding was opened following database locks for induction and maintenance periods separately.  
Overall,  the  blinding  procedures  are  considered  appropriate  to  avoid  bias  in  individual  patient 
assessments  and  in  the  statistical  analysis  and  reporting.  Specifically,  blinding  was  ensured  for  the 
assessments  relevant  to  the  two  main  types  of  questions:  efficacy  during  induction  treatment  and 
efficacy during maintenance among lebrikizumab responders at Week 16.  
Statistical  methods 
In the three pivotal studies, the comparability of the treatment arms with respect to the pharmacological 
effect  is  distorted  by  intercurrent  events:  treatment  discontinuation  and  the  allowance/use  of  rescue 
medications. The Applicant describes the primary estimand of each of the Phase 3 trials as “the difference 
between  treatment  conditions,  i.e.,  Lebrikizumab  vs  Placebo,  in  the  target  patient  population,  in 
successful  responses  or  means  after  16  weeks  achieved  without  use  of  rescue  medication  and  if  all 
patients continued with  treatment except those who discontinued due to lack of efficacy”. Indeed, ideally 
the  treatment  effect  would  have  been  assessed without  use  of  rescue  medication  among  treatment 
compliant  patients,  and the  fact these intercurrent  events did happen  should not  be allowed to  lead to 
anticonservative analyses.  
Applicant’s primary estimand and supportive estimand both consider any use of such rescue medication 
as a treatment  failure. The supportive estimand  for dichotomous  variables also consider any treatment 
discontinuation  as  a  treatment  failure.  This  approach  may  not  be  conservative  and  may  lead  to 
overestimation of treatment effect especially for endpoints that  are not closely related with  the decision 
to initiate rescue medication or discontinue study treatment due to lack of efficacy. Upon CHMP’s request, 
the Applicant provided descriptive analyses of disease activity and HRQoL (IGA, EASI, Pruritus NRS and 
DLQI)  before and after  initiation  of rescue medication to  allow  comparison of  the  outcome trajectories 
that tended to precede rescue medication as compared with  those that did not. Based on these analyses, 
although  participants who used rescue medication generally had higher disease activity than those who 
did not,  extensive overlap was noted in  outcome profiles within  the  same treatment  group. It  was also 
noted  that  few  patients  continued  efficacy  assessment  after  premature  discontinuation  of  study 
medication. These analyses further questioned the necessity of declaring “nonresponse” solely based on 
rescue medication and highlighted the need to evaluate treatment effect as per treatment policy strategy.   
The  Applicant  was  requested to analyse the  primary and  key secondary endpoints  in  accordance with 
ITT  principle,  i.e.,  treatment  policy  estimand  for  which  data  are  used  regardless  of  any  intercurrent 
events. Furthermore, should  rescue medication or treatment  discontinuation  also lead to  missing data, 
any imputation  models was to account for what is known about the subjects status with  respect to these 
intercurrent events. Still, the analyses provided by the Applicant imputed any missing data with MCMC-
MI  which,  in  practice, implies  a  hypothetical  scenario where  the  patients  with  missing  data  had  used 
randomised treatment and rescue medication in a similar manner with  those that  provided data. Despite 
this  caveat,  these  analyses  supported  the  existence  of  robust  treatment  effects  even  if  rescue 
medications were allowed, whether measured in terms of difference in proportion of responders or mean 
change from  baseline. As compared with  the  prespecified primary estimand,  these analyses that  used 
data regardless of rescue medication, however, attenuated treatment effect considerably for DLQI which 
could  have been  expected. This  endpoint  may be  less  driven by  the  factors that  drive the  decision to 
initiate  rescue treatment.  
Assessment report

Upon CHMP’s request, the Applicant clarified that for estimation of treatment-arm specific LSmeans, the 
default  covariate weights  of  the  respective SAS procedure were used.  These imply  a target  population 
where  a  third  of  patients  are  from  each region,  half  are adolescents  and  half  have  IGA of  3.  As was 
expected based  on  theoretical  grounds,  use  of  covariate  weights  that  correspond  to  study  population 
improved the  precision of estimation of LS  means: The  difference in SE was  the greatest for DLQI:  the 
SEs  of  the  LSmeans reported  in  CSR were  2-3  -fold  greater  in  comparison  with  SEs  estimated  using 
covariate weights  that  correspond to  the  study  population.  The  LS  mean point  estimates  happened to 
differ only little  depending on  whether the  default  covariate weights  or covariates weights  proportional 
to  the  study  population  were used.  Also noting  that  no  choice  of  covariate weights  could  impact  the 
estimate of treatment effect, the issue was not pursued further. 
Protocol amendments 
Substantial  changes  in  the  pivotal  trials  were  described  in  the  initial  MAA  and  further  clarified  upon 
CHMP’s  request.  It  can  be  concluded  that  these  changes  did  not  have  relevant  impact  on  the  study 
outcomes.   
Protocol deviations  and other  GCP issues   
Following primary outcome database lock in study KGAD (Week 16), a site audit triggered by statistically 
implausible data at one study site resulted in a critical finding. Due to this GCP non-compliance at 1 study 
site,  35  patients  were excluded  from  the  mITT  population,  18  from  Study  KGAC  and  17  from  Study 
KGAD. According to the Applicant,  any efficacy analyses performed on the data of these patients would 
have led to inconclusive and unreliable results due to the unreliable baseline AD values. For this reason, 
efficacy analyses in this  population were not performed. Based on further details upon CHMP’s  request, 
the  use  of  using  the  mITT  population  as  the  primary  analysis  population  appeared  justified  and  the 
findings do not change the overall conclusion on the B/R.  
16.3% and 15.5% of the patients during the Induction Period and 8.6 % and 7.9% of the patients during 
the Maintenance  Period were identified to have at least 1 important  protocol deviation in the KGAB and 
KGAC  studies,  respectively. Upon  CHMP’s  request,  the  Applicant  provided  further  discussion  on  the 
impact of important  protocol deviations on  participants’ safety and overall assessment of study results. 
It  can be  concluded that  participants’  safety was ensured and  that  no major impact  on  assessment of 
results is expected.  
In  KGAD  study,  altogether  52.6%  of  the  patients  were  identified  with  at  least  1  important  protocol 
deviation.  Although  this  is  can  be  considered a  high  number,  a  majority  were  in  the  category “study 
procedure/missing  safety  assessments”,  which  are  unlikely  to  affect  assessment  of  efficacy.  The  18 
patients  in  KGAC  study  and  17  patients  in  the  KGAD  study  were  included  in  the  important  protocol 
deviations in the category “inclusion/exclusion”.  
All  pivotal  studies  were  conducted  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  altogether  10.8%,  10.3%  and 
7.9% of the patients in the KGAB, KGAC and KGAD studies reported at least 1 protocol deviation related 
to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  According to  the  Applicant,  however, the  primary, coprimary, and all  key 
secondary endpoints were not impacted. 
Efficacy  data  and additional analyses 
Participant  flow 
Altogether 424  patients  were randomised in  the  KGAB study,  283  to  the  lebrikizumab 250  Q2W  group 
and  141  to  placebo  group.  157  (55.5%)  of  the  patients  lebrikizumab  group  were  considered  as 
responders (vs. 17%  in  the  placebo group),  were  re-randomised into  the  maintenance  blinded  period 
and  received either  placebo, lebrikizumab (n=32),  lebrikizumab 250  mg  Q4W  (n=63)  or lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q2W (n=48),  out of which 68.8%,  85.7% and 77.4%  of patients completed the 52-week study,

respectively. Altogether  106  patients  (37.5%)  receiving lebrikizumab during  the  induction  period were 
classified as non-responders and were enrolled into the escape arm, and 20 patients (7.1%) discontinued 
the study prior to week 16. 
A  total  of  445  patients  were randomised into  the  KGAC study.  Following  findings  of  a  site  audit,  data 
from all 18 participants at a specific site were excluded, creating an mITT Population of 427 participants, 
281  in  the  lebrikizumab 250  Q2W  group  and  146  in  the  placebo group.  134  (47.7%)  of  the  patients 
lebrikizumab  group  were  considered  as  responders  (vs.  15.1%  in  the  placebo  group),  were  re-
randomised  into  the  maintenance  blinded  period  and  received  either  placebo,  lebrikizumab  (n=28), 
lebrikizumab 250  mg  Q4W  (n=55)  or lebrikizumab 250  mg  Q2W  (n=51),  out  of  which  78.6%,  92.7% 
and 80.4% of the patients completed the 52-week study, respectively. Altogether 125 patients (44.5%) 
receiving lebrikizumab during  the induction  period were classified as non-responders and were enrolled 
into the  escape arm, and 22 patients (7.8%) discontinued the study prior to week 16. 
Percentages of screen failures were approximately 21%  in KGAB and 27%  in KGAC study, being  in the 
range presented for the  pivotal  studies  for mAbs approved in  moderate to  severe AD  indication. Upon 
CHMP’s request, the Applicant provided further details on the reasons for screen failures and no external 
validity issues arose.  
In  the  KGAD  study,  228  participants  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  groups.  mITT  population 
comprised of  211  participants  (145  in  the  lebrikizumab  250  Q2W  +  TCS  group and  66  in  the  placebo 
+TCS  group).  Altogether  134  patients  (92.4%)  in  the  lebrikizumab  250  Q2W  +  TCS  group  and  58 
patients  (87.9%)  in  the  placebo +TCS group  completed the  16-week  treatment. Percentage of screen 
failures was approximately 27%, being roughly similar as for add-on study for mAb approved in moderate 
to  severe AD  indication.  The Applicant  provided reasons for screen failures. No  external validity  issues 
arose.  
Demographic  and other  baseline characteristics 
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between  the study  groups in 
the  KGAB,  KGAC  and  KGAD  studies  in  terms  of  age,  percentage  of  adolescent  patients,  gender, 
weight/BMI and duration since the AD onset. Across the 3 pivotal studies, 49.7% were females, so both 
genders  were  equally  represented.  Overall,  patients  from  the  EU  represented  27.3%  of  the  total 
population; more specifically 32.5% in study KGAB, 26.7% in study KGAC and 18.0% in study 18.0%. 
Overall, 61.5% of patients had a baseline IGA of 3 (moderate atopic dermatitis), 38.5% of patients 
had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe atopic dermatitis), and 54.8% of patients had received prior systemic 
treatment. The mean baseline EASI was 29.6, the mean baseline Pruritus NRS was 7.2 and the mean 
baseline DLQI was 15.5. 
In  terms  of  prior  AD  therapies,  the  study  groups  were well  balanced in  all  pivotal  studies.  Almost  all 
reported  prior use  of  TCS  and  depending  on  the  study  prior  TCI  use was  reported by  33.6-43.4%  of 
patients. Approximately half of patients reported use of prior systemic treatment in pivotal studies. Unlike 
in  KGAB  and  KGAC studies,  prior use  of  dupilumab  was  allowed  in  KGAD  study  and  was  reported  by 
13.7%  of the  patients (13.8%  in the lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W + TCS group and 13.6%  in the placebo 
+ TCS group). In KGAD study, previous tralokinumab use was reported by 1 patient in each group.  
Primary  endpoints results (Weeks  0 to 16) 
Lebrikizumab demonstrated a statistically  significant  and clinically relevant improvements over placebo 
when  used as monotherapy (KGAB and KGAC) or in  combination with  TCS (KGAD) and  the co-primary 
endpoints,  i.e.  proportion  of  patients  achieving  EASI  75  and  IGA  0,1  (with  ≥2  point  reduction  from 
baseline) at Week 16 were met in all 3 pivotal studies. 
Assessment report

IGA 0,1 
Based on  the primary analysis using  the “hybrid”  estimand, 43.1%  and 33.2%  of  patients treated with 
lebrikizumab and  12.7%  and  10.8%  of  patients  treated  with  placebo  achieved IGA 0,1  with  ≥2-point 
reduction in the KGAB and KGAC studies at  Week 16. This translated into  a 29.7%  (95% CI 21.6,  37.8, 
p<0.001)  and  21.9%  (95%  CI  14.2,  29.6,  p<0.001)  difference from  placebo  in  the  KGAB and  KGAC 
studies, respectively.  
In KGAD, 41.2% of patients treated with lebrikizumab + TCS and 22.1% of patients treated with placebo 
+ TCS achieved IGA 0,1 with ≥2-point  reduction at Week 16. This translated into a 18.3% (95% CI 5.1, 
31.5,  p=0.011)  difference from placebo.  
EASI 75 
In KGAB and KGAC, 58.8%  and  52.1%  of patients  treated with  lebrikizumab and 16.2%  and 18.1%  of 
patients  treated with  placebo achieved EASI 75 at  Week 16. This  translated into  a 42%  (95%  CI 33.3, 
50.6,  p<0.001)  and  33.3%  (95%  CI  24.4,  42.2,  p<0.001)  difference from  placebo  in  the  KGAB and 
KGAC studies, respectively.  
In KGAD, 69.5% of patients treated with lebrikizumab + TCS and 42.2% of patients treated with placebo 
+  TCS  achieved EASI  75  at  Week  16.  This  translated  into  a  26.4%  (95%  CI  12.1,  40.8,  p<0.001) 
difference from placebo. 
The  supportive “composite”  estimand yielded similar  results  to  the  primary analysis of the  co-primary 
endpoints, with statistically significant differences and clinically relevant improvements with lebrikizumab 
over placebo when used either as monotherapy (KGAB and KGAC) or in combination with TCS (KGAD).  
Unlike in KGAB and KGAC studies, prior use of dupilumab was allowed in KGAD study and was reported 
by  13.7%  of  the  patients  (13.8%  in  the  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W  +  TCS  group  and  13.6%  in  the 
placebo  +  TCS  group). Subgroup  analyses of  the  primary and  key secondary  endpoints  suggest  that 
lebrikizumab shows benefit  also in patients  previously exposed to  dupilumab.  However, the number  of 
these patients is too small to make any firm conclusions. 
Key  secondary  endpoints (Weeks  0 to 16) 
For the Induction  Period, the key secondary endpoints in  studies KGAB and KGAC supported the effects 
seen  in  the  co-primary  endpoints.  In  KGAB  and  KGAC,  38.3%  and  30.7%  of  patients  treated  with 
lebrikizumab achieved EASI  90  at  Week 16  compared to  9.0%  and  9.5%  of  participants  treated  with 
placebo. The treatment  difference between lebrikizumab and placebo was  higher in KGAB compared to 
KGAC: 28.8 (95% CI 21.3, 36.3)  vs 20.7 (95% CI 13.3, 28.1). 
In KGAB and KGAC, 45.9% and 39.8% of patients treated with  lebrikizumab achieved pruritus NRS score 
≥4 point  improvement at Week 16 compared to 13.0% and 11.5%  of participants treated with  placebo. 
The  treatment  difference between lebrikizumab  and placebo  was slightly  higher in  KGAB compared to 
KGAC: 32.9 (95% CI 24.6, 41.3)  vs 28.3 (95% CI 20.0, 36.5). 
Overall, for the secondary endpoints under multiplicity adjustment, statistically significant improvements 
(i.e. p<0.05) in lebrikizumab group vs. placebo group were seen in all endpoints, except for “Percentage 
of patients with a Pruritus NRS of ≥4 points at Baseline who achieve a ≥4-point  reduction from Baseline 
to Week 2” in KGAC study.    
Similarly to the KGAB and KGAC studies, the key secondary endpoints in  the KGAD study supported the 
effects seen in the  co-primary endpoints. 41.2%  of  patients  treated with  lebrikizumab + TSC achieved 
EASI  90  at  Week  16  compared to  21.7%  of  participants  treated  with  placebo  +  TSC.  The  treatment 
difference between  lebrikizumab +  TSC  and  placebo  +  TSC  was  18.9  (95%  CI  6.1,  31.7).  50.6%  of 
patients  treated with  lebrikizumab +  TSC achieved pruritus  NRS score ≥4  point  improvement at  Week 
Assessment report

16  compared to  31.9%  of  participants  treated  with  placebo  +  TSC. The  treatment  difference between 
lebrikizumab and placebo was  19.2 (95%  CI 4.3,  34.1).  Overall, for all  key secondary endpoints  under 
multiplicity  adjustment,  a  statistically  significant  improvements  were  seen  in  lebrikizumab  group  vs. 
placebo group.   
Other  secondary  endpoints (Weeks  0 to 16) 
In addition to the co-primary and several major secondary efficacy endpoints, the pivotal Phase 3 studies 
included an extensive list of other secondary endpoints. Only selected secondary endpoints are presented 
by the Applicant.  Overall, lebrikizumab demonstrated an improvement over placebo in  several of these 
secondary endpoints, whether used as monotherapy or in combination with TCS.  
Maintenance  Treatment  period (KGAB  and KGAC) 
Regarding the  key secondary endpoints specific for maintenance period, in lebrikizumab-responders re-
randomised to the  Maintenance  Blinded Period, the maintenance of  EASI 75  response, IGA 0,1  (with  a 
≥2 point improvement from Baseline), Pruritus NRS 4-Point Improvement and percentage improvement 
in EASI was higher in patients  re-randomised to lebrikizumab vs. placebo. In general, the  maintenance 
of responses from week 16 to  week 52  was similar in patients re-randomised to  lebrikizumab Q2W and 
Q4W,  or even somewhat  better  in  the  lebrikizumab Q4W  group,  supporting  the  proposed Q4W  dosing 
after  the  Induction  Period.  It  is  noted  that  a  relatively  large  proportion  of  patients  that  were  re-
randomised  to  placebo  after  receiving  lebrikizumab  during  the  Induction  Period  (lebrikizumab 
withdrawal),  maintained the treatment  responses i.e. in the  pooled analysis of KGAB and KGAC studies 
66.4%  maintained EASI  75  response, 47.9%  maintained  IGA 0,1  (with  a  ≥2  point  improvement from 
Baseline) and 66.3% maintained Pruritus NRS 4-Point Improvement at Week 52.  
Simulation  data  suggested  that  patients  with  adequate  initial  response  may  continue  to  maintain 
response  with  250  mg  QXW  dosing  but  there  is  no  clinical  data  to  confirm  this.  It  is  therefore 
recommended that  the  Applicant  conducts  a clinical  study  that  compares Q4W  vs. QXW dosing  during 
the maintenance period in subjects who are initial responders at week 16. 
Maintenance  Week  16 Escape  Population Results (KGAB and KGAC) 
Among  the  patients  who  were  treated  with  placebo  and lebrikizumab  during  the  Induction  Period and 
received open-label lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W  (Maintenance  Week 16  Escape Population),  52.5%  and 
40% achieved IGA 0,1 and 83.9% and 76.9% achieved EASI 75 at Week 52. The responses were slightly 
higher  in  patients  that  received placebo  during  the  Induction  Period, but  this  group  also received two 
loading doses of lebrikizumab when entering the Escape Arm and used somewhat more rescue therapy, 
i.e.  42.2%  of  patients  that  received placebo  vs.  28.6%  vs.  those  that  received lebrikizumab  during 
Induction Period, respectively, received any rescue therapy during Weeks 16 to 52.    
The proposed Posology Section of the SmPC states that  “Consideration should be given to discontinuing 
treatment in patients who have shown no response after 16 weeks of treatment”.  Given that  part of the 
lebrikizumab  non-responders during  the  Induction  Period  achieved  clinically  relevant  responses (e.g. 
EASI 75,  IGA 0,1)  during  continued  treatment,  the optimal  time  point  for lebrikizumab discontinuation 
in  non-responders was  inconclusive. Upon  CHMP’s  request,  the  Applicant  provided further  analysis on 
patients  that  were  partial  responders  at  week  16,  showing  that  some  patients  could  benefit  if  the 
induction  dosing is continued  until  week 24.  Consequently, the SmPC was revised to include  the option 
to continue Q2W  up to week 24 in patients with  initial partial response.  
Rescue  therapy   
During  the Induction Period in KGAB and KGAC studies, the use of rescue medications was clearly more 
frequent  in  the  placebo  group  vs.  lebrikizumab group.  TCS  was  the  most  common  rescue treatment, 
used  by  29.8%  vs.  8.5%  of  the  patients  (KGAB),  and  37%  vs.  16.7%  (KGAC) of  the  patients  in  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 155/209 
 
 
 
placebo and lebrikizumab groups, respectively. Systemic rescue treatment was used by 7.8% vs. 2.5% 
of  the  patients  (KGAB),  and  6.2%  vs.  2.8%  (KGAC)  of  the  patients  in  the  placebo  and  lebrikizumab 
groups,  respectively. During  the  Induction  period,  patients in  the  lebrikizumab group  demonstrated a 
73% and 65%  reduction in the risk of initiating  rescue therapy vs. placebo in the KGAB study (HR: 0.27, 
95% CI: 0.17 to 0.42) and KGAC study (HR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.52), respectively. In pooled analysis 
for  the  KGAB  and  KGAC  study,  altogether  105  (36.6%)  placebo-treated  patients  vs.  83  (14.7%) 
lebrikizumab-treated patients required at least 1 rescue therapy before Week 16. 
During  the Maintenance Period of the  KGAB and KGAC studies, there were less differences in the use of 
rescue medications between groups. In the pooled analysis, 18.3%, 16.1% and 12.4% of patients in the 
placebo group (lebrikizumab withdrawal),  lebrikizumab 250  mg Q4W  and  Q2W, respectively, used any 
rescue medication. High-potency topical rescue therapy was used somewhat more in the placebo group 
(lebrikizumab  withdrawal),  i.e.  by  10%  of  the  patients  vs.  5.1%  and  4.4%  of  the  patients  in  the 
lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W and Q2W groups, respectively.    
Overall, rescue therapy use was comparable for all treatment groups during the Maintenance Period. Use 
of high-potency topical rescue therapy was highest for patients re-randomised to placebo (lebrikizumab 
withdrawal).  Use of systemic rescue therapy was low for all treatment groups. 
In  study  KGAD,  use  of low-to-mid-potency  TCS and  TCI  was allowed  to  be  used  and  not  regarded as 
rescue therapy and  therefore the  overall use of  rescue therapy  was lower  compared to  the  KGAB and 
KGAC monotherapy studies. Nevertheless, the  use of  rescue therapy was  higher in  the  placebo +  TCS 
group  vs.  lebrikizumab  +  TCS  group.  10.6%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  +  TCS  group  used  at  least  1 
rescue therapy during the study compared to 4.1% in the lebrikizumab + TCS group, mostly high potency 
TCS (4.5% vs. 1.4%), and systemic treatment (7.6% vs. 3.4%). 
In  the  pooled  analysis for  the  Week  16  Escape Arm  of  the  KGAB and  KGAC study  where  all  patients 
received open label lebrikizumab 250  mg  Q2W (Week 16  to  52),  any rescue therapy was  used slightly 
more  in  patients  that  received  placebo  (42.2%)  vs.  patients  that  received  lebrikizumab  during  the 
induction  period (28.6%).  
Subgroup analysis 
Based on  the subgroup  analysis of pooled data from the  Induction  Periods of Studies  KGAB and KGAC, 
and data from Study KGAD at Week 16, the treatment effect in subgroups were generally consistent with 
the  overall study population,  although  in the  pooled data from KGAB and KGAC studies, the  proportion 
of patients  achieving IGA 0,1, EASI 75 and EASI 90 was somewhat lower in patients in the weight  group 
≥100 kg vs. weight  group ≤60  kg. For the Maintenance Period, the responses in the weight group ≥100 
kg  were somewhat  higher  with  Q2W  dosing  vs.  Q4W  dosing.  However, the  number  of patients  in  the 
≥100  kg subgroup  was  too  low  to  make further  conclusions based  on  these results.  In  summary, the 
proposed  Q4W  dosing  in  subjects  ≥100  kg  is  acceptable,  as  the  overall  benefit-risk  balance  of  Q4W 
dosing is considered positive also in these subjects.   
Adolescents 
A subgroup analysis was performed for the adolescent population from the pivotal Phase 3 studies KGAB, 
KGAC  and  KGAD.  In  the  pooled  analysis  of  the  KGAB  and  KGAC  studies,  46.6%  vs.  14.3%  of  the 
adolescent patients achieved IGA 0,1 and 62.0% vs. 17.3% achieved EASI 75 at Week 16 in lebrikizumab 
vs.  placebo groups,  respectively. In  KGAD  study,  57.3%  vs. 28.6%  of  the  of  the  adolescent  patients 
achieved IGA 0,1 and 88.0% vs. 57.1% achieved EASI 75 at Week 16 in lebrikizumab vs. placebo groups, 
respectively.  Furthermore,  16-week  results  were  presented  separately  for  the  KGAE  study,  which 
enrolled only  adolescent patients.  Altogether,  these  analyses provided evidence that  lebrikizumab has 
similar or somewhat better efficacy in adolescent population compared to adult population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 156/209 
 
 
 
KGAE  study  was  an  open  label  52-week  study,  with  the  aim  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
lebrikizumab in adolescent patients (from 12 years to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg). The eligibility criteria 
were similar as in the  Ph3 studies  KGAB and KGAC in terms of  moderate to  severe AD, i.e.  all patients 
had  EASI≥16,  IGA  score≥ and  BSA≥10%,  and  were  candidate  for  systemic  therapy.  Altogether  206 
patients were evaluated for efficacy (MCMC-MI analysis). At week 52,  62.6% had an IGA score of 0 or 1 
and  a  reduction  of  ≥2  points  from  baseline,  and  81.9%  achieved  EASI  75.  It  is  noted  that  the 
lebrikizumab dose used in the study (after the 500 mg loading doses at week 0 and 2) was 250 mg Q2W 
from Week 4 through Week 52, which differs from the proposed maintenance dose of 250 mg Q4W after 
Week 16 in the SmPC. Nevertheless, the study provided supportive long-term efficacy data in adolescents 
and provided additional safety exposure data in this population. 
Supportive  studies 
In addition to the  pivotal studies, the clinical program in AD  includes a long-term extension study (LTE) 
up to  100 weeks (KGAA), a separate 52-week study in  adolescents (KGAE) (see above) and supportive 
Phase 2 studies  (KGAG, KGAH and  KGAF). At  the time  of the  initial  MAA, the  LTE  study and a  study to 
evaluate the  effect of  lebrikizumab on vaccine responses (KGAK) were  ongoing. The  CSR of the  KGAK 
study  was submitted  as part  of the second round  of assessment. Whereas immune responses to  Tdap 
were not affected by lebrikizumab, significantly  higher immune responses to MCV  vaccine were seen in 
lebrikizumab-treated subjects vs. placebo-treated subjects. Upon request, the Applicant provided further 
discussion on the higher responses to the MCV vaccination in the lebrikizumab-treated group vs. placebo 
group. Although no clear root cause was identified, it is reassuring that the response rates to MCV in the 
lebrikizumab  group  was  within  the  range  reported  in  other  studies,  e.g.  with  dupilumab  and 
tralokinumab. Therefore, it can be concluded that the antibody responses to both non-live vaccines were 
not  negatively  impacted  by  the  concomitant  lebrikizumab  treatment.  The  results  of  the  effect  of 
lebrikizumab on vaccine responses is reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
KGAA study 
In terms of the LTE study KGAA, the initial MAA included data for 86 lebrikizumab-responders from KGAD 
study,  who  were  re-randomised  2:1  to  receive  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W  or  Q4W.  Out  of  the 
lebrikizumab-responders at week 16 of the KGAD study,  71.7% and 67.6%  of the patients  had IGA 0,1 
response, and  85.9%  and 81.2%  had EASI 75 response after 56 weeks of continuous  treatment in  the 
lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W and Q4W  groups, respectively. Out  of the lebrikizumab-responders who had 
IGA 0,1 or EASI 75 response at week 16, 75.4% and 86.8% maintained IGA 0,1 and 85.9% and 81.2% 
maintained EASI 75 in lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W and Q4W groups, respectively after 56 weeks in KGAA 
study. The patients  were allowed to  use low to moderate potency TCS as needed, and over 70% of the 
patients used TCS. Rescue therapy, including high potency TCS and systemic rescue therapy, was used 
by  7.0%  and  13.8%  of  the  patients  in  the  lebrikizumab 250  mg  Q2W  and  Q4W  groups,  respectively. 
Overall,  the  efficacy  results  were  similar  in  the  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W  and  Q4W  groups,  which 
support the Q4W dosing in the  long-term treatment.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
Lebrikizumab demonstrated a statistically  significant  and clinically relevant improvements over placebo 
when used as monotherapy or in  combination with  TCS in adolescent and adult patients  with  moderate 
to severe AD who are candidate for systemic therapy. The co-primary endpoints were met in all 3 pivotal 
studies, supported by several key secondary efficacy endpoints. The proposed posology for the induction 
period is  500  mg  at  week 0  and week  2 followed  by 250  mg every other week until  week 16.  For  the 
maintenance period, the  proposed posology is  250  mg every four  weeks. The posology is endorsed by 
CHMP. The CHMP concluded that  the efficacy data supports the following indication: “Ebglyss is indicated

for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
with  a body weight of at least 40 kg who are candidates for systemic therapy”. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety  
The safety of lebrikizumab in the treatment of adults and adolescents with AD is supported by data 
from 13 studies included in the clinical development program for AD (6 phase 1, 3 phase 2 and 4 
phase 3 studies). Placebo-controlled safety data in AD patients treated with the intended dose for 16 
weeks was available from studies KGAB, KGAC, KGAD and KGAF. Long term safety data up to 52/56 
weeks was available from studies KGAB, KGAC and KGAA (an extension study). Adolescents were 
included in studies KGAB, KGAC and KGAD. In addition, an open-label single arm study KGAE provided 
safety data in only adolescents. 
Safety  data  are  presented  separately  for  4  periods:  the  induction  period,  the  maintenance  period, 
combined induction  and maintenance period and  any exposure to lebrikizumab. To  evaluate safety for 
the  mentioned  periods,  6  different  analysis  sets  were  defined.  In  the  induction  period,  3  different 
analysis sets were defined: AD ALL PC Weeks 0 to 16 (also referred to as LEB with or without TCS), AD 
Mono  PC Weeks 0  to 16  (also referred to  as LEB monotherapy) and AD  TCS PC Weeks 0 to  16  (from a 
single  study  - KGAD,  also  referred to  as  LEB+TCS).  The maintenance  period  is  evaluated in  the  AD 
Mono PC Weeks 16 to 52 set (Maintenance Period Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set; includes lebrikizumab 
responders during the induction period who were re-randomised to LEB Q2W, LEB Q4W or placebo during 
the  maintenance  period;  of  note:  patients  treated  with  placebo  during  induction  could  also  be  re-
randomised to one of the 3 arms in maintenance). The combined induction and maintenance  period 
are evaluated in the AD  Mono/TCS Weeks 0 to 52/56  set (Combined Induction and Maintenance Periods 
Analysis Set), while any exposure  to lebrikizumab is evaluated in the AD All LEB set.  
The safety population used in this application is the modified safety population, which includes all 
participants receiving at least 1 dose of study drug minus 38 participants (from studies KGAD, KGAC 
and KGAA; 36 lebrikizumab-treated and 2 placebo-treated patients) who were excluded due to 
unreliable data from one centre discovered during a site audit. Data for the concerned 38 participants 
are however available in the Dossier. 
The most important analysis set is that which  allows for assessment of causality between the treatment 
and  safety outcome. This  analysis set  (AD  ALL  PC  Weeks 0-16)  includes  the  16-week safety profile  of 
lebrikizumab 250  mg  Q2W in  three  placebo-controlled monotherapy studies (KGAF,  KGAB, KGAC) and 
one  placebo-controlled combo  study  (KGAD).  Data  from  this  pooled  analysis set  were  used  to  report 
ADRs and frequencies in the product information.  
Safety data for indications other  than  AD were provided as supportive safety data but  these  data were 
not integrated into the AD safety database due to differences in disease states and comorbid conditions, 
dose level and regimen, and drug product and process change.  
Supportive safety data was also provided from a study to evaluate the effect of lebrikizumab on vaccine 
responses in  patients  with  AD  (KGAK).  The  study  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of  data  cut-off  and  safety 
results were not pooled in the integrated analysis set but are presented separately. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient  exposure  
As  of  the  data  cutoff  date  of  06  June  2022,  the  AD  safety  database  included  1720  participants 
(372  adolescents) exposed to lebrikizumab at any dose. Overall exposure was 1637.02 patient-years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023  
Page 158/209 
 
 
 
Of the 1720 participants with  moderate-to-severe AD, 891 participants (270 adolescents) were exposed 
to lebrikizumab for at least 1 year, 744 participants  (246 adolescents) were treated with  Q2W only, and 
132 participants  (23 adolescents) were treated Q2W followed by Q4W for at least 1 year.

2.6.8.2.  Adverse  events   
2.6.8.2.1.  Overview  of Adverse  Events  
Table  62  and  Table  63  provide  an  overview of  adverse events  for  the  different  analysis  sets  during 
induction  and maintenance treatment. 
Induction period (placebo-controlled  Weeks  0 to 16) 
During the induction phase, the frequencies of SAEs were similar in the lebrikizumab and placebo groups. 
Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. A higher proportion of participants discontinued treatment 
due  to  an  AE  in  the  lebrikizumab group  (2.3%)  compared  to  placebo  (1.4%),  with  the  most  notable 
difference coming from the AD TCS analysis set. TEAE related to study treatment were more common in 
the lebrikizumab group (42 (10.4%) vs. 131 (16.8%)  for PBO vs LEB respectively). 
The frequencies of SAEs, TEAEs, and AEs leading to  discontinuation were similar between lebrikizumab-
treated subjects regardless of TCS.

2.6.8.2.3.  Other  Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events by SOC   
TEAEs were analysed by SOC to assist in identification  of AEs that  may be apparent only when all effects 
on a given organ system are evaluated in aggregate. 
Induction period (Placebo-controlled  Weeks  0 to 16) 
LEB with or without TCS  (AD ALL PC) 
The most  frequently  reported SOCs for  lebrikizumab-treated participants  compared to  placebo-treated 
participants were 
• 
Infections and infestations 
o  21.2%  in the LEB 250 mg Q2W group versus 18.9% in the  placebo group (primarily 
driven by the PTs conjunctivitis and nasopharyngitis)  
• 
Eye disorders 
o  6.6%  in  the  LEB  250  mg  Q2W  group  versus 4.4%  in  the  placebo group (primarily 
driven by the PTs conjunctivitis allergic and dry eye)  
•  Nervous system disorders 
o  6.3% in  the LEB 250 mg Q2W group versus 4.6% in the placebo group, and  
•  General disorders and administration site conditions 
o  5.1% in  the LEB 250 mg Q2W group versus 3.9% in the placebo group. 
Odds  ratios  for the  frequencies of  TEAEs within  SOCs were presented  in  appended  tables  (not  shown 
here for brevity). In addition to the  common TEAEs presented above, the following less common TEAEs 
were more than twice as frequent with LEB than with  PBO (odds ratio ≥2) in the induction phase: 
Within  the SOC Infections and infestations: gastroenteritis.  
Within  the SOC Eye disorders: blepharitis. 
Within  the SOC Nervous system disorders: dizziness. 
Within  the  SOC  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions:  injection  site  erythema  and 
injection site reaction. 
Within  the SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: asthma, cough, oropharyngeal pain and 
sinus congestion. 
Within  the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhoea. 
Within  the SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Pain in extremity 
Maintenance  period (AD Mono PC Weeks  16 to 52) 
The frequencies of TEAEs within  the following SOCs were higher in the LEB 250 mg Q4W group compared 
to the placebo (LEB withdrawal) group. 
• 
Infections and infestations 
o  30.5%  in  the  LEB  250  mg  Q4W  group  versus 21.0%  in  the  placebo (LEB  withdrawal) 
group 
• 
Eye disorders

o  9.3% in the LEB 250 mg Q4W group versus 5.0% in the placebo (LEB withdrawal)  group 
(primarily driven by the PT Conjunctivitis allergic) 
•  Nervous system disorders  
o  7.6% in the LEB 250 mg Q4W group versus 3.3% in the placebo (LEB withdrawal)  group 
(primarily driven by the PT Headache), and 
•  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  
o  3.4% in the LEB 250 mg Q4W group versus 1.7% in the placebo (LEB withdrawal)  group 
(primarily driven by 2 events of Back pain).   
Combined induction and maintenance  period (AD Mono/TCS Weeks  0 to 52/56) 
The frequencies of TEAEs in the following  SOCs were higher in the lebrikizumab-treated groups through 
Weeks 0  to 52/56  compared to the  LEB 250  mg Q2W  group of the placebo-controlled induction  period. 
This was not unexpected based on longer exposure to lebrikizumab. 
The frequencies of these SOCs were 
• 
Infections and infestations 
o  30.1%  in the LEB 250 mg Q2W only group  
o  44.9%  in the LEB 250 mg Q2W/Q4W  only group, and 
o  19.0%  in the placebo group.  
• 
Eye disorders 
o  11.5%  in the LEB 250 mg Q2W only group 
o  12.9%  in the LEB 250 mg Q2W/Q4W  only group, and 
o  4.5% in  the placebo group. 
•  Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
o  6.6% in  the LEB 250 mg Q2W only group  
o  6.1% in  the LEB 250 mg Q2W/Q4W  only group, and 
o  2.6% in  the placebo group. 
•  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
o  6.0% in  the LEB 250 mg Q2W only group 
o  5.4% in  the LEB 250 mg Q2W/Q4W  only group, and 
o  3.4% in  the placebo group.  
2.6.8.2.4.  Adverse  events  of special interest   
Conjunctivitis 
In the SmPC, the term Conjunctivitis includes the PTs of Conjunctivitis and Conjunctivitis bacterial. The 
PT of Conjunctivitis allergic is listed as a separate ADR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023 
Page 171/209 
 
 
 
In the induction phase the frequency of conjunctivitis events was 6.9%% in the LEB 250 mg Q2W group 
versus 1.8%  in  the  placebo group.  During  maintenance, the  frequency of  conjunctivitis  was  5.0%  in  
the  LEB  250  mg  Q4W  group  and  5.9%  in  the  placebo  (LEB  withdrawal)  group.  14.2%  of  patients 
experienced Conjunctivitis  or  Conjunctivitis  bacterial  during  one  year  of  treatment  with  the  intended 
dose. Overall, events within  the conjunctivitis, keratitis, ocular symptoms, and dry eye clusters and PT 
of blepharitis were reported in 17.7% of patients treated with the intended dose for one year.  
All  events  reported  within  conjunctivitis,  keratitis,  ocular  symptom,  and  dry  eye  clusters  were 
nonserious and  mild  or moderate in  severity. One lebrikizumab-treated participant  reported a  severe 
event of blepharitis.

Note:  Conjunctivitis  as  identified in  this  table  refers  broadly  to  several  ocular  symptoms  and  disorders  including 
blepharitis, conjunctivitis of various etiologies (that is, bacterial, viral, allergic), and dry eye. 
Infections, including herpes  infections, relevant  parasitic  infections, and opportunistic 
infections 
The  incidence  of  the  Infections  and  infestations  SOC  was  higher  in  lebrikizumab-treated 
participants versus placebo-treated participants.  
The  most  frequently  reported  events  within  this  SOC  and  reported  with  higher  frequency  in  the 
lebrikizumab group  compared to  placebo were  nasopharyngitis (4.4%  in  the  lebrikizumab group and 
3.2%  in  the  placebo  group) and  Herpes zoster  (0.6%  in  the  lebrikizumab group  and 0  events  in  the 
placebo  group).  No  confirmed  opportunistic  infections  were  reported.  A  lower  frequency  of  skin 
infections was  reported in  the  lebrikizumab-treated participants  (2.2%)  during the  placebo-controlled 
period compared to placebo (5.9%). One helminth-parasitic infection was reported by a participant who 
received LEB  250  mg  Q2W  during  induction  and  LEB  250  mg  Q4W  during  maintenance  in  the  AD 
Mono/TCS Weeks 0 to 52/56 analysis set.  
In the  induction  phase, all herpes infections combined were balanced across treatment groups (2.9%  
in  the  lebrikizumab  group  and  3.7%  in  the  placebo  group).  However,  Herpes  zoster  events  were 
reported only in the  lebrikizumab group (0.6%)  during  induction,  therefore, Herpes zoster is included 
as an ADR in proposed labeling. 
The incidence of serious infections was low;  1 case of severe infectious colitis,  two  cases of COVID-19, 
one case of  acarodermatitis and erysipelas and  one case of  pneumonia in  the  combined induction  and 
maintenance phases in  patients  treated with  lebrikizumab. All  events were recovered/resolved and did 
not lead to treatment discontinuation. 
These findings  were consistent  when  participants  were treated  with  lebrikizumab with  or  without  TCS. 
No  clinically  meaningful  differences were observed between  different  dosing  regimens of  LEB  250  mg 
Q2W and LEB 250 mg Q4W. 
Eosinophilia and eosinophil-related disorders 
From  baseline  to  Week 16  the  frequency of  participants  with  increased  blood eosinophils  at  any  time 
point  post-baseline  was  higher  in  lebrikizumab-treated  participants  (20.3%)  compared  to  placebo-
treated  participants  (11.7%).  Mean  increases in  eosinophil  from  baseline to  Week 16  for  the  LEB  250 
mg Q2W group was 0.11  x 109  cells/L while the mean increases from baseline for the placebo group was 
0.  Overall,  mean  increases  were  small  and  did  not  lead  to  eosinophil-related  disorders.  Eosinophilia 
(greater than 5000 cells/mm3) is included as an ADR in proposed labeling. 
Hypersensitivity  reactions 
During  the  placebo-controlled  induction  period,  no  clinically  significant  imbalance  in  the  frequency  of 
hypersensitivity events was reported with  lebrikizumab compared to placebo. No specific pattern of PTs 
Assessment report

was  observed besides  Dermatitis  atopic  (as  most  events  were  related to  the  underlying  disease). No 
serious events of immediate hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis were reported. 
Injection  site reactions    
ISRs were reported in  a numerically higher frequency in  the  lebrikizumab-treated group (n=20,  2.6%) 
compared  to  placebo  (n=6,  1.5%)  during  the  induction  period  with  or  without  TCS.  A  total  of  53 
participants  reported an ISR TEAE during the  one-year follow-up.  The majority of  participants reported 
ISR TEAEs within Week 0 to 16 (n = 38) and Weeks 16 to 32 (n = 15).  
No dose related differences were reported. Most events were mild or moderate in severity and none were 
serious. ISR is included as an ADR in proposed labeling. 
Atopic dermatitis  exacerbation   
Events representing AD exacerbation, specifically dermatitis atopic, were reported with a lower frequency 
in  the  lebrikizumab-treated group  (6.4%)  compared to  the  placebo-treated group  (18.9%)  during  the 
induction  period  with  or  without  TCS.  The  majority  of  events  were  nonserious,  mild  or  moderate  in 
severity, and  did  not  lead  to  treatment  discontinuation.  The  IR  of  AD  exacerbations in  lebrikizumab-
treated  participants  was  lower  in  the  AD  All  LEB  group  (8.8  per  100  PY)  compared to  lebrikizumab-
treated participants during the placebo-controlled period (22.3 per 100 PY). 
Hepatic  safety  
Based on the hepatic disorders SMQ (narrow terms), the percentage of participants that reported at least 
1 TE hepatic disorder during  the induction  period was 1.1%  (n = 8) in  the lebrikizumab group, and 0 in 
the placebo group.  
Shifts to  high serum AST and ALT were more common in participants receiving lebrikizumab during the 
induction period. During induction, a shift to high serum alanine aminotransferase is noted in LEB 250mg 
Q2w  (54  events,  7.8%)  compared  to  placebo  (12  events,  3.6%).  A  shift  to  high  serum  aspartate 
aminotransferase is  noted  in  LEB  250mg  Q2W  (31  events,  4.2%)  compared  to  placebo  (11  events, 
3.1%).  Of  note,  the  frequencies were  calculated among  patients  with  normal  baseline values and  ata 
least  one  post-baseline  measure.  During  maintenance,  a  TE  shift  to  high  in  serum  alanine 
aminotransferase has been observed in LEB 250mg Q4W arm (7 events, 6.8%) and LEB 250mg Q2w (8 
events, 8.4%)  compared to  placebo (2  events, 4.3%).  A shift  to  high  aspartate aminotransferase has 
been recorded in 4 participants (7.5%) in placebo, 3 (2.8%) in LEB Q4W and 5 (5%) in LEB Q2W. 
The frequency of hepatic TEAEs through Weeks 52/56 (in the  combined induction  and maintenance set, 
ie. AD  Mono/TCS Weeks 0 to 52/56)  were: 17 (2.0%)  in  the LEB 250  mg Q2W only group; 4 (2.7%)  in 
the  LEB  250  mg Q2W/Q4W  only  group, and  0 in  the  placebo group.  The most  frequently PTs reported 
across all treatment groups were AST increased, ALT increased, and GGT increased. 
The frequency of  participants  reporting at  least  1  hepatic TEAE  any AD  lebrikizumab exposure set (ie. 
AD All LEB) were: 48 (2.8%) in the Any LEB group; 34 (2.5%) in the Any LEB Q2W group, and 10 (4.1%) 
in the Any LEB Q4W group. 
In any lebrikizumab exposure set,  participants with  elevated transaminase (and normal bilirubin)  were 
recorded. ALT values ≥5x ULN (and normal bilirubin) were recorded in 3 (0.2%) additional participants. 
Narratives of those patients  are provided, however follow-up laboratory data could not  be obtained  for 
any of the  3 patients  after peak ALT values were recorded. AST values ≥5x ULN  (and normal bilirubin) 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023 
Page 174/209 
 
 
 
were recorded in  1 (0.1%)  additional  participant  (in  any lebrikizumab exposure set).  The participant’s 
narrative provides a plausible alternative explanation for the observed lab values and myopathy (extreme 
weightlifting).  One participant with  AST value at least 10x ULN  and normal TBL was identified. According 
to  the  participant’s  narrative, the  study drug  was not  interrupted despite  a significant  rise  in enzymes 
on Day 525 (AST 11,2xULN,  GGT 12.5xULN, ALT 4.3xULN,  ALP 1.7xULN)  but no more data is available. 
Suicide/self-injury   
Two  (0.1%)  events of  suicidal ideation  within  the  suicide/self-injury standardised MedDRA  query were 
reported across the entire AD  program. One event was reported during the  induction  period and 1  SAE 
was reported during the  long-term extension study associated with  an acute stressor. No events led to 
treatment discontinuation.   
An adult female participant  with  history of anxiety and depression and treated with  lebrikizumab during 
induction  period  reported a  nonserious  moderate  event  of  suicidal  ideation  on  Study  Day  66.  Patient 
recovered on the same day. 
An  adult  female participant  with  no medical  history of  depression reported a SAE  of major depression 
with  suicidal  ideation  following  a major  traumatic  life  event  on  Study  Day  449.  She  was treated  with 
escitalopram  and  therapy  visits.  The  event  recovered on  Study  Day  503  and  did  not  lead  to  study 
discontinuation.Given  that  the prevalence of clinical  depression in  adults with  AD is  around 15% (Patel 
et  al.  2019)  and  that  suicidal  ideation  is  common  in  severe depression,  and  that  there  is  no  specific 
signal of increased risk of suicide by blocking IL-13, it is agreed that the data do not suggest an increased 
risk of suicide/self-injury among those treated with lebrikizumab.  
Malignancies   
Overall, 13 lebrikizumab-treated participants (0.8%) reported 20 malignancy events after any exposure 
to lebrikizumab during 0-52/56 weeks of follow-up. During the placebo-controlled period, nonmelanoma 
skin cancer (NMSC) events were reported in 2 patients (0.3%) in  the lebrikizumab group and 2 patients 
(0.5%)  in  the  placebo  group.  No  malignancies  other  than  NMSC  were  reported  during  the  placebo-
controlled  induction  period.  NMSC  events  were  generally  unremarkable,  localised,  and  a  similar 
frequency was reported across treatment  groups.  All NMSC  events were nonserious, mild  or moderate 
in severity, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. 
Seven  participants  reported  malignancies  other  than  NMSC  in  the  Any  AD  Lebrikizumab  Exposure 
analysis set. One  participant  died from pancreatic carcinoma with  metastases to  liver and bone during 
the  Study  KGAC  maintenance  escape period.  For  brevity,  only  narratives of  malignancies in  younger 
participants will  be presented here.  
An adult  female with  no  pertinent medical history reported a neuroendocrine tumor of the  appendix on 
Study Day 245  in the  open-label arm of Study KGAA and  received lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W.  The SAE 
was not resolved during the study period and led to study discontinuation on Study Day 282.  
An adolescent male with  a  history of AD  and lower lip  epidermoid cysts treated with  LEB  250  mg Q2W 
on  Study Day  1  reported a  mild  nonserious event of  cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). 
Investigator  could  not  confirm  the  diagnosis  of  mycosis  fungoides  due  to  the  participant’s  age  and 
Assessment report

immunohistochemical  stains  required  for  a  definitive  diagnosis  was  pending.  Participant  discontinued 
from the study. 
An adult  male  participant  reported a moderate nonserious event of cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma during 
the maintenance period on Study Day  149. The event was not recovered. Participant discontinued  from 
the study due to physician decision. 
An  adult  female  participant  reported  a  moderate  and  nonserious  event  of  left  ovarian teratoma.  The 
event recovered and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse  event/deaths/other  significant events   
Deaths  in the AD Program 
There were 4 deaths in the lebrikizumab AD clinical programme. 
• 
• 
1 death due to myocardial infarction was reported in the placebo group during the 16-week induction 
period of Study KGAC, and  
3 deaths were reported in participants treated with lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W 
o  1  death due  to  pancreatic cancer was reported in  the  maintenance escape period of  Study 
KGAC 
o  1  death  due  to  natural  causes was  reported in  the  long-term  extension Study  KGAA after 
rolling over from Study KGA 
o  1 death due to cardiac arrest was reported in the open-label period of Study KGAE. 
The  available information  indicate  no  apparent  relation to  study  drug.  However, two  events  with  very 
limited data available are described in more detail below. 
An  adult  male participant  was  enrolledin Study  KGAD  and laterentered the  long-term  extension Study 
KGAA. During  the  long-term extension Study KGAA, the participant  died of natural  causes, as reported 
by the investigator. The participant had a medical history of hypertension, cardiac ablation, AD, insomnia, 
and  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease.  The  investigator  assessed  the  event  to  be  unrelated  to  study 
treatment. 
During  the open-label Study KGAE, an adolescentmale participant died of cardiac arrest , as reported by 
the investigator. The participant tested positive for COVID-19 in the hospital emergency room as part of 
screening.  The  investigator  reported  the  cardiac  arrest  was  likely  due  to  COVID-19.  The  investigator 
assessed the event to be unrelated to study treatment.  
Deaths  in the Asthma Program 
To support safety evaluations for the AD  submission, an integrated database with  all studies  (Phases 1 
to 3) conducted in participants with  asthma was created to form an Asthma ALL Lebrikizumab Exposure 
Analysis  Set  (Asthma  ALL  Lebrikizumab).  This  is  an  uncontrolled  dataset  and  included  studies  with 
various treatment regimens and doses. Only descriptive statistics are provided for this analysis set.  
Treatment  doses for  asthma studies  were lower  than  for AD  studies.  In  Phase 2,  doses studied  varied 
and  included  37.5  mg,  125  mg,  or  250  mg  Q4W,  and  in  some  studies  participants  were  dosed  at 
0.3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg. In Phase 3, doses studied included 37.5 mg or 125 mg administered Q4W. 
There were 5 deaths in the Asthma ALL  LEB analysis set reported for lebrikizumab-treated participants, 
3 of which occurred in lebrikizumab-treated participants during the treatment period. 
Assessment report

The provided narratives indicate no relation to study drug. 
Other  Serious Adverse  Events 
All SAEs in the placebo-controlled induction  period were single cases. No clinically meaningful differences 
between  treatment  groups  were  noted  for  SAEs  in  either  the  induction  or  the  maintenance  phase. 
Frequencies of  SAEs during the  maintenance phase  and IRs of  SAEs in  the AD  All  LEB  analysis set did 
not suggest an increase with longer exposure. 
Induction period (Placebo-controlled  Weeks  0 to 16) 
The frequency of participants reporting at least 1 SAE was similar in the lebrikizumab and placebo groups 
(Table 67). No single PT within  a SOC was reported by more than  1 participant in each treatment  group 
during induction.

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory  findings  
Chemistry  analytes  where  numerical  differences  were  observed  between  lebrikizumab  and  placebo 
groups and which were not yet addressed in safety topics of special interest include: 
•  Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
potassium 
sodium 
chloride 
phosphate  
urate 
Based  on  assessment  of  the  provided  data,  the  observed  differences  were  not  considered  clinically 
meaningful. 
There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  observed for  changes  in  haematology  and  chemistry 
analytes for lebrikizumab-treated participants  compared to  those  treated with  placebo. In  some of the 
analytes, differences in prevalence of “high”, “low”, or “abnormal” haematology findings were observed; 
however, mean changes from baseline were small and not clinically meaningful. 
Weight 
This section describes weight changes in adult participants. Weight in adolescents is discussed 
separately. 
Induction period (Placebo-controlled  Weeks  0 to 16) 
LEB with  or without  TCS (AD ALL PC) 
The  frequency of  adult  participants  with  weight  gain  defined  as  at  least  a  7%  increase  at  any  time 
postbaseline was higher in the LEB 250 mg Q2W group (5.1%) compared with  placebo (1.8%). Box plots 
with  changes up to  Week 16 illustrate that  these frequencies were influenced by a few participants with 
higher values.  
The  frequency  of  adult  participants  with  weight  loss  defined  as  at  least  a  7%  decrease at  any  time 
postbaseline was 3.3% in the LEB 250 mg Q2W group compared to 5.2% in the placebo group. 
Overall,  in  the  induction  period  the  mean  and  median  changes  in  weight  from  last  baseline  to  last 
postbaseline in adults were

The frequencies of participants with weight loss at any time were  
• 
• 
• 
5.7% in  the LEB 250 mg Q2W only group 
11.7%  in the LEB 250 mg Q2W/Q4W  only group, and

The frequencies of participants  with  weight  loss (at  least 7%)  at  any time  in  any lebrikizumab-treated 
participant  through  Weeks  0  to  52/56  were  higher  than  the  LEB  250  mg  Q2W  group  in  the  placebo-
controlled induction period (3.3%). 
2.6.8.5.  Safety  in special populations  
2.6.8.5.1.  Safety  Analyses in the Adolescent  Population  
The AD  safety database included 372 adolescents (12-18  years of age) exposed to lebrikizumab at  any 
dose. 270  adolescents were exposed to lebrikizumab for at  least 1  year. 246  adolescents were treated 
with  Q2W only, and 23 adolescents were treated Q2W followed by Q4W for at least 1 year. 
Induction period (Placebo-controlled  Weeks  0 to 16) 
LEB with or without TCS  (AD ALL PC) 
A total of 1187  participants (1040  adults and 147 adolescents) were included in  the AD ALL PC analysis 
set. 
In  the  adolescent  population,  TEAEs  were reported  at  a  lower  frequency in  the  lebrikizumab  (35.6%) 
group compared to the placebo (55.3%) group. All events were mild or moderate in severity. No deaths 
occurred  in  the  placebo-controlled  analysis  set.  One  (1%)  SAE  of  synovitis  was  reported  in  the 
lebrikizumab group compared to no events in the placebo group.  
The most common TEAEs in  adolescents (ages 12  to  less than  18  years old) occurring more frequently 
in the lebrikizumab-treated adolescents compared to placebo were 
• 
• 
• 
• 
conjunctivitis  
nasopharyngitis 
dry eye, and 
rhinitis  allergic

Although  the  sample size  is  small and  frequencies are  low,  the  reported numbers of the  following  PTs 
were  numerically  higher  in  the  lebrikizumab-treated  adolescent  population  compared  to  the 
lebrikizumab-treated adult population (at least 18 years of age)  
•  Dry eye (2.9% versus 1.2%) 
• 
Pruritus (2.2%  versus 1.0%), and 
•  Rhinitis  allergic (2.2% versus 0.9%) 
All other common PTs were reported with  similar or numerically higher frequency in the adult population 
compared to adolescents.

The  frequency  of  participants  with  at  least  1  TEAE  in  the  adult  population  was  similar  across  age 
subgroups (adolescent, adult, elderly) The sample size for those older than  75 years of age was limited. 
Although  numerical  differences  for  individual  PTs  may  show  some  variability  across  age  groups,  no 
treatment by age group interaction was identified.

compared to  2.4%  in  the  LEB  arm.  The  frequency of  hypersensitivity and  injection  site  reactions was 
balanced across treatment arms an in line with  previous studies. Other events of special interest (herpes 
infections,  malignancies,  self-injury,  severe eosinophilia)  did  not  occur  in  LEB  treated  patients  during

this  16  week study.  No  new  safety topics  in  terms  of  nature,  frequency or  severity of adverse events 
arose from the results of study KGAK.  
The safety and immunogenicity profile in study KGAK is consistent with what  has been observed in prior 
studies. 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events   
ADA frequencies  in Phase  1 and phase 2 Trials 
In the phase 1 trials, ADA were present in 0-10% of the healthy subjects post baseline.  
In the phase 2 trials, 18-25% of AD patients were at some point post baseline positive for ADA after any 
dose of lebrikizumab. Persistent  positive ADA  results (i.e.,  positive for more than  2  post-baseline time 
points or positive at  the last time point) were less frequent. Although most of the positive post-baseline 
ADA results were deemed to  be treatment-emergent, most ADAs were transient  (positive ADA detected 
in only one post baseline sampling timepoint). 
ADA frequencies  in Phase  3 Trials 
In  the  phase  3  trials,  immunogenicity  was  assessed using  a  newly  developed immunogenicity  assay, 
which  was  more sensitive,  specific,  and  drug  tolerant  than  the  assays used for  phase  1  and  phase  2 
trials.  
A total of 822  participants randomly assigned to lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W were evaluable for TE ADA. 
At baseline, the incidence of ADA was 72 (8.8%), (10.6% in  KGAB, 8.5% in KGAC and 7.7% in KGAD). 
Of the 822 evaluable participants in the lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W only group through 1 year, 
• 
• 
28 (3.4%)  participants became TE ADA positive, 
• 
• 
21 (2.6%)  participants were treatment-induced, 
7 (0.9%)  participants were treatment boosted, and 
24 (2.9%)  participants were NAb positive. 
Of the 145 evaluable participants who responded to lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W and were re- randomised 
to lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W through 1 year, 
• 
• 
4 (2.8%)  participants became TE ADA positive, 
• 
• 
2 (1.4%)  participants were treatment-induced, 
2 (1.4%)  participants were treatment boosted, and 
4 (2.8%)  participants were NAb positive. 
Of the 330 evaluable participants treated with continuous placebo, 
• 
• 
• 
3 (0.9%)  participants became TE ADA positive, 
3 (0.9%)  participants were treatment-induced, and 
3 (0.9%)  participants were NAb positive. 
A vast majority of TE ADA positive participants (26 of 28, 92.9%)  in the lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W only 
treatment group had a maximum titre  through the  dosing period of 1:160  or less. The highest reported 
TE ADA titre in  this treatment group was 1:640,  and it was reported in only 1 patient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023 
Page 187/209 
 
 
 
A similar titre  distribution was seen for TE ADA positive responder participants treated with lebrikizumab 
250  mg  Q2W  followed  by  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q4W.  Both  treatment-induced  participants  had  a 
maximum postbaseline titre  of  1:20,  and  the  2 treatment-boosted  participants  had maximum  titres  of 
1:40  and 1:160, respectively. 
For  TE  ADA  positive  participants  treated  with  only  placebo,  the  highest  maximum  reported titre  was 
1:40. 
Among participants treated at any time with any dose of lebrikizumab (Atopic Dermatitis All Lebrikizumab 
Exposure Integrated Immunogenicity Analysis Set,  Studies KGAB, KGAC, KGAD,  KGAE, and/or KGAA), 
117 (9.2%) participants had ADA present at baseline. For all participants exposed to lebrikizumab across 
the 5 clinical studies, 1272  were evaluable for TE ADA. 
•  49 (3.9%)  participants became TE ADA positive, 
•  36 (2.8%)  participants were treatment-induced, 
•  13 (1.0%)  participants were treatment boosted, 
•  43 (3.4%)  participants were NAb positive, and 
•  9 (0.7%)  participants were TE ADA inconclusive. 
A  subset  analysis  of  adolescent  participants  (ages  12  to  less  than  18  years)  demonstrated  similar 
immunogenicity incidence to the overall population. 
Effect of Immunogenicity on Pharmacokinetics,  Efficacy  and safety 
Phase  1 trials 
In  most  of  the  phase  1  trials  no  or  only  few  subjects  were  ADA  positive  at  baseline or  had  TE  ADA. 
Pharmacokinetics was comparable in TE ADA positive and TE ADA negative subjects in phase 1 trials. 
Phase  2 trials 
According to  the  clinical  study  reports (CSRs), concentrations  of lebrikizumab were slightly  reduced in 
ADA positive patients relative to ADA negative patients in studies KGAG and KGAH. One patient in study 
KGAG  (100701)  experienced  a  substantial  drop  in  lebrikizumab  serum  concentrations  from  Week  4 
onwards that was likely ADA-induced.   
The Applicant confirmed that the presence of ADA was not found to impact PK in study KGAF. Persistent 
positive neutralizing  ADA  (NAb)  was  observed for  a total  of  3  patients,  PK results  for these  3  patients 
were generally consistent with overall findings for corresponding dose groups.  
Phase  3 trials  
The impact of baseline and TE ADA on the  PK of lebrikizumab was evaluated using pooled phase 3 data 
from  Week  0  to  52.  Two  datasets  were  used,  one  with  Q2W  maintenance  dosing  (data  from  studies 
KGAB, KGAC, KGAD,  and KGAE) and  the  other  for Q4W  maintenance  dosing (data  from  studies KGAB 
and  KGAC).  Graphical  exploration  indicated  that  patients  who  were  ADA  positive  had  lebrikizumab 
exposure that was consistent with patients  who were ADA negative.  
A summary of the effects of immunogenicity on the clinical outcomes of EASI75 and IGA (0,1),  at Week 
52  was  provided. The  percentage of  responders at  week 52  was  equal  or higher  among  patients  who 
were TE ADA positive compared to patients who were TE ADA negative. 
No  summary  on  the  association  between  TE  ADA  and  treatment  effect  was  provided  for the  week 16 
timepoint,  which was the time point  for evaluation of primary efficacy.

The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions and ISRs was evaluated in patients who were TE ADA positive 
versus  TE  ADA  negative  using  the  AD  combined  induction  and  maintenance  periods  immunogenicity 
analysis set.  
Using  all narrow and broad search terms, the  frequency of hypersensitivity reactions in the  continuous 
lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W  treatment group was similar between  TE ADA negative and TE ADA  positive 
participants  (208  of  792,  26.3%  and  7  of  28,  25.0%,  respectively). Using  narrow search  terms  only, 
hypersensitivity  reactions  were  reported  with  a  higher  numerical  frequency  in  TE  ADA  negative 
participants  compared  to  TE  ADA  positive  participants  (138  of  792,  17.4%  and  4  of  28,  14.3% 
respectively). In the  lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W/Q4W  treatment group, no  TE ADA positive participants 
reported hypersensitivity reactions (broad and narrow terms) compared to 35 of 140, 25.0%  of TE ADA 
negative participants. Similar results were seen for the continuous placebo treatment group. 
The  frequency  of  participants  with  at  least  1  Injection  site  reaction  high-level  term  (HLT)  TEAE  was 
higher  in  the  LEB  250  mg  Q2W  only  participants  who  were  TE  ADA  positive  (N  =  28,  n  =  3,  10.7%) 
compared  to  those  who  were  TE  ADA  negative  (N  =  792,  n  =  23,  2.9%).  There  was  no  temporal 
association with ISRs and development of TE ADA. 
In both  the  LEB  250  mg Q2W/Q4W  only treatment  group and  continuous placebo treatment  group, no 
TE  ADA  positive participants  had  ISRs, compared to  3  of  140  (2.1%)  and 5  of  327  (1.5%)  of TE  ADA 
negative participants in each treatment group, respectively. 
No  clinically  meaningful  association  was  found  between  TE  ADA  status  and  hypersensitivity events  or 
ISRs. 
2.6.8.7.  Safety  related  to drug-drug interactions  and other  interactions   
No formal studies have been conducted to examine the effect of lebrikizumab on the PK of other drugs. 
As a mAb, lebrikizumab is not anticipated to directly impact the PK of other drugs.  
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse  events   
In the  induction  phase 18  (2.3%)  subjects in  the  LEB 250  mg  Q2W group  had at  least 1  AE leading to 
discontinuation  of study treatment, compared to 6 (1.4%) subjects in the PBO group. 
In  the  maintenance  phase,  the  frequencies  of  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment were: 
•  1 (0.9%)  event of vernal keratoconjunctivitis in the LEB 250 mg Q2W group, and 
•  2  (1.7%)  events  (1  event  of  conjunctivitis  allergic  and  1  event  of  conjunctivitis)  in  the  LEB 
250 mg Q4W group. 
Events  leading  to  discontinuation  in  the  lebrikizumab  treated  patients  were  mostly  related  to  the 
conjunctivitis  cluster and to  atopic dermatitis and  other skin infestations  which could  be related to  lack 
of  efficacy. The  number  of  subjects  experiencing AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  was  low,  suggesting  that 
lebrikizumab is well tolerated.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety  
The  clinical program designed to  assess the  safety of  lebrikizumab is focused on  adult  and  adolescent 
patients  at  least 12  years of age and  >40kg  with  moderate-to-severe AD.  To date,  1720  patients  with 
moderate-to-severe AD have been exposed to  lebrikizumab, 1228  patients  have been treated  with  the 
intended induction  dose for ≥16  weeks and 132 patients  have been treated with  the intended  induction 
and maintenance posology for at least 1 year. The ICH E1 requirements on the size of the safety database 
and the degree of patient exposure are well exceeded.  
Safety data for this application have been obtained from adult and adolescent participants with AD 
from 8 studies: 1 Phase 2, randomised open-label Study KGAH (ARBAN), 5 multi-centre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (including 2 Phase 2 Studies KGAG (TREBLE) and KGAF, and 3 
phase 3 Studies KGAB (Advocate 1), KGAC (Advocate 2), and KGAD (Adhere)), 1 Phase 3, open-label, 
adolescent single arm Study KGAE (Adore), and 1 Phase 3 long-term safety Study KGAA (Adjoin). 
Phase 3 clinical study programme consists of studies KGAB and KGAC (replicative design: randomised, 
double-blind, placebo controlled), KGAD (randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, lebrikizumab in 
combination with  TCS), KGAE (open-label single arm study in adolescents) and KGAA (long-term 
extension study). The cut-off date was 06 June 2022. 
There is one ongoing extension study (KGAA) listed as a Category 3 study of the RMP that will address 
the safety concern on long term safety. The final study report is anticipated for February 2025. 
Proposed safety  profile 
No  monitoring guidance is  proposed in  the SmPC. No  dose adjustments are proposed for elderly, renal 
and hepatic  impairment and body weight.  No  contraindications except for hypersensitivity is proposed. 
The  warnings  listed  in  section  4.3  of  the  SmPC  include  hypersensitivity,  conjunctivitis,  vaccinations, 
helminth  infection  and  traceability.  Lebrikizumab  is  to  be  avoided  concurrently  with  live  and  live 
attenuated vaccines. These SmPC proposals are agreed by the CHMP. 
Regarding  the  safety  concerns  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (section  2.7.1),  the  Applicant  does  not 
propose any important  identified  risks, nor  important  potential  risks. Proposed as  missing information 
are long term safety and safety in pregnant and breastfeeding women. 
Adverse events 
The  Applicant  initially  proposed  to  include  conjunctivitis,  herpes  zoster,  eosinophilia,  keratitis  and 
injection  site reaction as ADRs  in  section 4.8  of the  SmPC. Based on  differences between lebrikizumab 
and placebo arms, and upon CHMP’s request, dry eye and blepharitis were also included in SmPC section 
4.8.  
Despite  the  presence of  long-term  safety  data  and  the  intended  continuous  use  of  lebrikizumab,  the 
Applicant  chose  to  tabulate  only  TEAEs  from  the  16-week  induction  phase  as  ADRs  in  the  product 
information. The safety profile of lebrikizumab during the  induction  period can be well  characterised by 
comparison to placebo (lebrikizumab 250mg Q2W vs placebo). However, causality assessment of TEAEs 
in  the  maintenance period  is  difficult.  Responders in  trials  KGAB and  KGAC were  re-randomised after 
week 16 (with no washout period), and a new posology arm (lebrikizumab 250mg Q4w) was introduced. 
Placebo arms  used  for comparison  of TEAE  incidences  during  maintenance  were  not  true  placebo  but 
represented patients  re-randomised to  placebo after  initial  response to  lebrikizumab (LEB).  Moreover, 
the majority of data for the placebo arm in the combined induction and maintenance analysis set comes 
from  the  induction  period  which  makes the  treatment  arms incomparable  in  terms  of  exposure time. 
Ultimately,  only  6  patients  completed  52  weeks of  treatment  receiving  placebo throughout  the  whole 
period, limiting the soundness of comparison to placebo in the long-term setting. There is no comparator 
Assessment report

Page 190/209 
 
 
 
in the Any exposure to lebrikizumab set. Taken together, true and ‘clean’ comparator data exists for only 
the first 16  weeks.  
Despite these difficulties, the ADR list in section 4.8 should include all AEs from various sources for which 
a  causal  relationship  is  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility,  as  per  the  SmPC  Guideline.  Upon  thorough 
reassessment of the data, no new ADRs were found during maintenance but all ADRs to be included were 
already seen during the placebo controlled 16-week induction.   
Although  the Applicant applied for the  dosing regimen of lebrikizumab 250mg Q4W  in the  maintenance 
period,  the  dosing  regimen of  Q2W  was  also  evaluated  during  the  maintenance  period.  Many  TEAEs 
occurred with  a  higher frequency in  LEB Q4W  compared to  Q2W.  However, as previously commented, 
these data are difficult to interpret in a meaningful way.  
Common TEAEs 
The most frequently reported SOCs for lebrikizumab-treated participants, occurring more often compared 
to  placebo,  were  Infections  and  infestations  (primarily  driven  by  the  PTs  conjunctivitis  and 
nasopharyngitis), Eye disorders (primarily driven by the PTs conjunctivitis allergic and dry eye), Nervous 
system disorders (primarily driven by the  PT Headache) and  General disorders and administration  site 
conditions (injection site reactions). 
Common TEAEs are those reported at  a frequency of greater than  or equal to  1%  in the  lebrikizumab-
treated group. Common TAES reported more frequently in the lebrikizumab group compared to placebo 
in  the  induction  phase  were  conjunctivitis  (6.9%),  nasopharyngitis  (4.4%),  headache  (4.4%), 
conjunctivitis allergic (1.8%), dry eye (1.4%) and rhinitis allergic (1.0%). 
Some TEAEs were reported more often  with  lebrikizumab than  with  placebo during induction  but  were 
not  included  as ADRs  in  the  SmPC. The  Applicant was  requested to  justify  and clarify these  decisions. 
Upon  further  scrutiny  of  the  data  it  was  concluded  that  headache,  nasopharyngitis,  herpes  simplex, 
rhinitis  allergic, high serum cholesterol, hepatic enzymes elevated and weight gain are not ADRs.  
In  the  maintenance  period,  the  most  common  TEAEs  in  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q4W  were  COVID-19 
(9.4%),  nasopharyngitis  (7.6),  conjunctivitis  allergic  (5.9%),  conjunctivitis  (5.0%),  dermatitis  atopic 
5.9%),  headache  (4.2%),  oral  herpes (3.4%)  and  folliculitis  (2.5%).  All  of  these  TEAEs,  except  for 
dermatitis  atopic  and  conjunctivitis,  were more  frequent with  LEB  250  mg  Q4W  compared to  those  in 
the LEB withdrawal  placebo arm.  
Despite  higher frequencies in  patients  treated with  LEB,  based on the  totality  of  data it  was  concluded 
that  a  plausible  causal  relationship  was  only  present  for  the  following  TEAEs:  Conjunctivitis,  Herpes 
zoster, Eosinophilia, Conjunctivitis allergic, Keratitis, Dry eye, Blepharitis, and Injection site reaction.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
The frequency of participants reporting at least 1 SAE was low and similar in the lebrikizumab and placebo 
groups during  both  the  induction  and  maintenance period. During  induction,  frequencies of SAEs were 
similar for both treatment arms regardless of concomitant TCS.  
All SAEs in the placebo-controlled induction  period were single cases. No clinically meaningful differences 
between  treatment  groups  were apparent  for  SAEs in  either  the  induction  or  the  maintenance  phase. 
Frequencies and incidence rates of SAEs did not suggest an increase with longer exposure.  
In total  4 deaths  were recorded during  the AD  lebrikizumab clinical programme. One death occurred in 
placebo  arm  while  3  deaths  occurred  in  patients  receiving  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W.  Investigators 
assessed all deaths as unrelated to study drug treatments.

Adverse events of special interest 
Conjunctivitis was an expected adverse event, as it has been commonly observed in AD patients treated 
with  other drugs in the same drug class. The observed incidence rates (6.9% in the induction phase and 
5.0%  in  the  maintenance  phase)  were  similar  to  those  seen  in  AD  patients  treated  with  other  mAbs 
acting on IL-13. Over the whole 52-week treatment, the overall incidence of conjunctivitis was 14.2% in 
the target population treated with the intended dose (LEB 250mg Q2W/Q4W). The frequencies of TEAEs 
from keratitis cluster, ocular symptoms cluster and blepharitis cluster are all increased in LEB compared 
to  placebo arms, albeit with  rather small numerical differences between treatment  arms. The observed 
keratitis  events were  regarded as extensions  of more  severe forms of  allergic  conjunctivitis  and  were 
included as ADRs. 
The  majority  of  events  in  the  conjunctivitis  and  keratitis  clusters  were  nonserious,  the  majority  of 
participants had 1 event, the majority of events resolved and almost all events required treatment with 
medications.  
It  appears that  conjunctivitis  is an  ADR specific  to AD  patients  as  it  was not  seen in  the  asthma study 
program nor in  monkeys. A higher  proportion of lebrikizumab-treated participants  who reported an  AE 
of conjunctivitis,  keratitis,  ocular symptom,  dry eye clusters, and  blepharitis PTs had a  medical history 
of  conjunctivitis  or  facial dermatitis  compared to  participants  who  did  not  report conjunctivitis  related 
AEs.  
In both  the  induction  and  maintenance period, the  frequency of participants  who reported eosinophilia 
TEAEs was higher among participants receiving lebrikizumab compared to placebo. There were no events 
of  eosinophil-related  disorders.  In  total  8  patients  treated  with  lebrikizumab  across  analyses  sets 
experienced  severe  eosinophilia  (3  in  induction  period,  3  additional  in  combined  induction  and 
maintenance  period  and  2  additional  in  any  lebrikizumab  exposure).  In  at  least  2  participants  the 
eosinophil  level  did  not  return  to  baseline  and  in  3  participants  a  lack  of  efficacy  was  observed. 
Eosinophilia is  listed as an ADR  which  is endorsed. The eosinophilia frequency “uncommon” in  the ADR 
table  refers only to  severe eosinophilia  (>5000  cells/mm3).  Given the  clearly higher  overall frequency 
of increased blood eosinophils in lebrikizumab-treated participants (20.3%) compared to placebo-treated 
participants (11.7%), the Applicant was requested to add this information to the SmPC section 4.8 under 
the description of selected adverse reactions sub-section. 
Of note, in the supportive study KGAK, the frequency of mild eosinophil elevation was in line with findings 
in other studies which indicates that the event is causally related to the drug and the frequency of around 
20% is not  a chance finding. 
In the induction period, the frequency of TEAE Infections and infestations is somewhat higher in LEB 250 
mg Q2W arm compared to placebo (21.2% vs 18.6%).  
Based  on  the  presented  data  and  the  requested  additional  discussion  it  can  be  agreed  that 
nasopharyngitis,  gastroenteritis,  diarrhoea,  and  herpes  simplex  are  not  ADRs  with  a  reasonable 
possibility for causality although slightly higher frequencies were seen. Lack of biological mechanism and 
no  dose-response  pattern  are  the  main  reasons  for  this  conclusion.  For  example,  in  the  case  of 
nasopharyngitis, the  exposure adjusted  incidence rate with  LEB  250mg  Q2W was  lower  than  that  with 
placebo, which  makes it implausible that the lower dose of LEB 250mg Q4W  would be causally linked to 
nasopharyngitis. 
Although  the  incidence of  herpes simplex  was  slightly  higher  with  LEB  during  induction,  there  was no 
difference  during  maintenance  and  the  number  of  subjects  is  very  small.  In  addition,  another 
manifestation  of  a herpes simplex  infection,  the  eczema herpeticum  was lower  with  LEB  than  placebo 
during maintenance. Therefore, causality between LEB and herpes simplex is not considered plausible.

No  confirmed opportunistic  infections  were reported. A  lower frequency of skin infections  was reported 
in  the  lebrikizumab-treated  participants  (2.2%)  during  the  placebo-controlled  period  compared  to 
placebo  (5.9%),  reflecting  the  efficacy  of  lebrikizumab.  The  incidence  of  serious  infections  was  low; 
1 case of  severe infectious  colitis,  two  cases of  COVID-19,  one case of  acarodermatitis and  erysipelas 
and one case of pneumonia in the combined induction and maintenance phases in patients treated with 
lebrikizumab. All events were recovered/resolved and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. 
No  events  of  parasitic  infections  were  reported  in  any  treatment  group  in  the  induction  nor  in  the 
maintenance  period. One  (0.7%)  parasitic  infection  in  the  LEB  250  mg  Q2W/Q4W  only  group (KGAD-
6016-002)  was  reported  in  the  combined  induction  and  maintenance  period.  It  was  a  case  of  mild 
enterobiasis and ascariasis that resolved after treatment. 
In the induction period, frequency of immediate hypersensitivity reactions was lower in LEB 250mg Q2W 
(n=22,  2.8%)  compared to  placebo (n=25,  6.2%).  All  the  events  were  nonserious, and  only  a  small 
number  of  participants  discontinued  treatment  (in  those  who  did,  the  events  were  not  true 
hypersensitivity  reactions).  In  the  maintenance  period,  the  frequency  of  immediate  hypersensitivity 
reactions was slightly higher in both lebrikizumab arms although the number of events is very small. 
The  frequencies  of  nonimmediate  hypersensitivity  events  in  the  induction  period  were  lower  in  the 
lebrikizumab group  (n  =  77,  9.9%)  compared to  placebo (n  =  69,  17.1%),  while  in  the  maintenance 
period  the  frequencies  were  similar  in  LEB  Q4W  and  placebo  (n  =  17,  14.4%  and  n  =  8,  13.3%, 
respectively). The frequency of  non-immediate  hypersensitivity reactions in  adolescents receiving LEB 
Q4W  (17.6%  in  the  maintenance period and 20.7%  in  any LEB  exposure set) was higher  compared to 
adults receiving the same dosing regimen (13.9%  in maintenance and 10.2% in any LEB exposure) and 
higher compared to adolescents receiving placebo (12.5% in maintenance) or adolescents receiving LEB 
Q2W  (0  in  maintenance  and  14.3%  in  any  LEB  exposure  set).  Upon  request,  the  non-immediate 
hypersensitivity reactions were examined more closely, and the  Applicant claims the  reported PTs were 
not considered true nonimmediate hypersensitivity reactions (ie. dermatitis atopic, conjunctivitis allergic, 
dermatitis contact and rhinitis allergic). It is agreed that those reactions could be a manifestation of the 
underlying condition.  The number of included  adolescents is notably smaller compared to adults,  which 
is a possible explanation for the difference in proportions among the two populations rather than a true 
difference in  occurrence of these reactions. The observation of a higher frequency of these reactions in 
adolescents receiving LEB  Q4W compared to  LEB  Q2W  is  likely due to  a  very small  sample size in  the 
LEB Q4W arm (29 adolescents in total).  
In the induction  period, the frequency of injection site reactions was higher in the lebrikizumab group (n 
=  20,  2.6%)  compared to  placebo (n  =  6,  1.5%).  The  most  frequently  reported PTs  in  lebrikizumab-
treated participants were injection site pain, injection site erythema and injection site reaction. Injection 
site reactions are listed as ADRs.  
Regarding hepatic  safety,  the  frequency of participants  reporting  at  least  1  TE  hepatic  disorder in  the 
induction period was higher in lebrikizumab compared to placebo group (8 participants (1.1%) compared 
to  0). In the  maintenance period, the situation  is similar, albeit with  few  events (3  participants  (2.5%) 
in  LEB  Q4W;  1  participant  (0.9%)  in  LEB  Q2W  and  1  participant  (1.7%)  in  placebo).  Also,  in  any 
lebrikizumab exposure set,  an imbalance in  the  frequency of  hepatic TEAEs  is observed in  participants 
receiving  LEB  250  mg  Q4W  compared  to  Q2W  (10  participants  (4.1%)  vs  34  participants  (2.5%), 
respectively).  
No  participants  with  laboratory criteria  for Hy’s  law were  identified,  neither in  the  induction  nor in  the 
maintenance period. In the Any AD lebrikizumab exposure set (AD All LEB), one participant meeting the 
criteria for potential  Hy’s law  was identified.  A narrative for this  subject is provided which  reveals self-
reported drinking  alcohol before drawing  blood, thrombocytopenic  at  baseline, baseline GGT  4.7xULN, 
AST 2.3x ULN,  AST:ALT ratio of 4:1. On Day 213 he developed jaundice and lab results showed GGT 5x 
Assessment report

Page 193/209 
 
 
 
ULN,  AST 153  (3.7x  ULN),  and  TBL  92.3  umol/L  (4.5x  ULN).  According to  the  narrative, the  patient  is 
most  likely to  have alcoholic liver disease. Moreover, since abnormal liver biochemistry was present at 
baseline,  it  would  be  more  appropriate  to  replace  the  ULN  with  the  pre-treatment  baseline  level 
(according  to  CIOMS  on  DILI:  consensus  report  from  2020).  According  to  this  modification  of  the 
definition,  the  raise in  AST was  1.6  times  from  the  baseline  level, which  does not  reach the  Hy’s  law 
threshold of transaminase elevation.  
In any lebrikizumab set, additional  3 participants were identified with  ALT values ≥5x  ULN  (and normal 
bilirubin) and 1 additional  patient with  AST values ≥5x ULN (and normal bilirubin). 
The  Applicant  argues that  due  to  the  lack  of mechanistic  plausibility,  the  low  frequency of  TEAEs and 
SAEs,  low  treatment  discontinuations,  the  absence of  DILI,  and  infrequent  laboratory  shifts,  hepatic 
events were not deemed to be associated with  lebrikizumab. Based on further scrutiny of  the data and 
a  detailed  individual  case review for  participants  with  AST/ALT  elevations above 3xULN,  a  reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship cannot be unequivocally established at this time. 
There seemed to be a difference in  weight  gain between treatment arms. However, weight  fluctuations 
were not sustained over time and only seen among some BMI categories. Based upon the totality of the 
data, it was concluded that  a causal relationship between lebrikizumab and weight gain is not likely. 
Two events of suicidal ideation were reported in  the AD program (both  treated with  LEB) and one event 
of completed suicide was reported in the asthma program with  lower dose lebrikizumab. Given that the 
prevalence of  clinical depression in  adults  with  AD  is around  15%  (Patel et  al.  2019)  and  that  suicidal 
ideation  is  common in  severe depression, and  that  there  is  also no  specific  signal  of increased risk  of 
suicide by blocking IL-13, it is agreed that  the data do not suggest an increased risk of suicide/self-injury 
among those treated with  lebrikizumab. This topic will continue to be routinely monitored and presented 
for discussion in PSURs as a topic of interest.  
Regarding malignancies, there were no malignancy events other than NMSC reported during the placebo-
controlled induction period. No malignancy was reported in the Weeks 16 to 52 maintenance period. 
One death was reported during the combined induction and maintenance period in a 73-year-old male 
participant due to metastatic  pancreatic carcinoma. 
However,  in  any  lebrikizumab  exposure  set  7  additional  lebrikizumab-treated  participants  reporting 
malignancy (other than  NMSC)  were found. It  is noted  that  out  of these 7  additional cases, 4 occurred 
in  younger  patients  (aged  17-30)  and  included  2  participants  with  cutaneous  T-cell  lymphoma,  1 
participant with  neuroendocrine tumour of the appendix and 1 participant with  ovarian teratoma. There 
is limited information about these events; 3 participants (out of these 4) discontinued study participation 
and the outcome of the malignancy is unknown. This is potentially concerning. The Applicant has agreed 
to  continue  monitoring  the  occurrence  of  malignancies  in  patients  receiving  lebrikizumab  as  part  of 
routine  surveillance  activities.  Based  on  a  comprehensive  discussion  provided,  this  approach  is 
reasonable for the time being. 
Immunogenicity 
Characterisations of immunogenicity were conducted with data from seven clinical pharmacology studies, 
three Phase 2  AD  studies and  five Phase 3  AD  studies. The  focus of this assessment is on  the Phase 3 
AD  studies as they  are considered most relevant to the AD  indication and  the most adequate and up to 
date analytical method was used for ADA detection in these studies. 
In the phase 1 trials,  ADA were present in  0-10%  of the healthy subjects post baseline. In the  phase 2 
trials,  18-25%  of  AD  patients  were  at  some  point  post  baseline  positive  for  ADA  after  any  dose  of 
lebrikizumab. However, most of the positive post-baseline ADA results were transient.

EMA/453942/2023 
Page 194/209 
 
 
 
In the combined phase 3 Studies KGAB, KGAC and KGAD, 3.4% of participants treated with lebrikizumab 
250  mg  Q2W,  2.8%  of  participants  treated  with  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W/Q4W,  and  0.9%  of 
participants treated with placebo developed treatment-emergent ADA over 12 months. Nearly all TE ADA 
positive  participants  were  also  positive  for  NAb  to  lebrikizumab  but  most  ADAs  were  low  titre.  No 
association between TE ADA (including  titre magnitude) and treatment effect at week 16 or 52 could be 
established.  ADA/Nab  frequencies and  titres  were similar  in  the  adolescents  compared to  the  overall 
population.  Upon  request, the  Applicant  provided supplementary information  and confirmed that  ADAs 
are not expected to have clinically relevant impact on exposure to lebrikizumab.  
No  clinically  meaningful  association  was  found  between  TE  ADA  status  and  hypersensitivity events  or 
ISRs. 
Safety in special populations 
There  were  53  participants  older  than  65  years  of  age  exposed to  lebrikizumab during  the  induction 
period.  Only  15 participants  older  than  75  were  exposed  in  the  same  period.  The  safety  of  elderly 
subjects is addressed in the SmPC according to QRD template. Based on the subgroup analyses provided, 
no special concern in the elderly is evident.  
The AD  safety database included 372 adolescents (12-18  years of age) exposed to lebrikizumab at  any 
dose. 270  adolescents were exposed to lebrikizumab for at  least 1  year. 246  adolescents were treated 
with  Q2W only, and 23 adolescents were treated Q2W followed by Q4W for at least 1 year. 
The overall safety profile in all adolescents exposed to any dose of lebrikizumab was consistent with the 
safety profile in adults in terms of frequency and nature of adverse events. In the induction period overall 
SAEs, TEAEs, discontinuations  and TEAEs  within  special safety topics all  occurred with  lower frequency 
in adolescents compared to adults in both lebrikizumab and placebo groups.  
The  most  common  TEAEs  in  adolescents  occurring  more  frequently  in  the  lebrikizumab-treated 
adolescents compared to placebo were conjunctivitis, nasopharyngitis, dry eye, and rhinitis allergic.  
In the induction phase, dry eye, pruritus and rhinitis allergic were PTs with numerically higher frequencies 
in the lebrikizumab-treated adolescent population compared to the lebrikizumab-treated adult population 
(at least 18 years of age). After any exposure to LEB the frequency of eosinophilia was higher in the LEB 
treated  adolescents  12  (3.2%)  compared  to  LEB  treated  adults  15  (1.1%).  These  small  differences 
between frequencies of AEs in  adolescents compared to adults  are of no  clinical importance and do not 
affect how ADRs are reported in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Regarding  weight,  height  and  BMI  in  adolescents,  no  meaningful  differences  in  growth  parameters 
between placebo and lebrikizumab were observed based on the mean changes in any LEB  group for Z-
score  close  to  0  for  all  growth  parameters. No  particular  patterns  arise  from  the  numerically  small 
differences in common TEAEs in  the induction  period across age groups, for sex, weight,  race, ethnicity 
and across geographical regions.  
Additional  safety  data  was  obtained  from  a  study  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  lebrikizumab  on  vaccine 
responses in  patients  with  AD  (KGAK).  The  study  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of  data  cut-off  and  safety 
results  were not  pooled in  the  integrated  analysis set.  The safety  and immunogenicity  profile in  study 
KGAK was consistent with that in  the pooled analysis set. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety  
No  major safety issues are identified  for  patients  with  atopic dermatitis  treated  with  lebrikizumab and 
the overall safety profile is manageable. The data suggest that most AEs occur within the first few months 
of drug treatment and that the AE pattern does not change over time. No clinically meaningful differences 
were  observed  between  different  lebrikizumab  dosing  regimens  (Q2W  vs.  Q4W  in  the  maintenance 
phase).  No  differences  in  AE  pattern  were  seen  between  monotherapy  and  lebrikizumab  +  topical 
treatment.  The  overall  safety  profile  in  all  adolescents  exposed  to  any  dose  of  lebrikizumab  was 
consistent with  the safety profile in adults in terms of frequency and nature of adverse events.  
The  frequency  of  treatment  emergent  anti-drug  antibody  formation  was  low, up  to  2.8%  of  patients 
treated  with  250  mg  lebrikizumab  developed  ADAs.  No  clinically  meaningful  association  was  found 
between TE ADA status and PK, efficacy or safety.  
The ongoing open-label long-term safety extension study KGAA listed as a Category 3 study of the RMP 
will  provide  further  information  to  characterise long-term  safety.  In  addition,  an  observational study 
listed as a Category 3 study will provide further information on the use of lebrikizumab during pregnancy.

Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that  this will  allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition  
The proposed indication for lebrikizumab is: “treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults 
and adolescents 12 years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg who are candidates for systemic 
therapy.” 
Atopic dermatitis (AD)  is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder characterised by erythematous, 
pruritic, dry, scaly and often lichenified skin. Pruritus is a hallmark of AD and is responsible for much  of 
the  disease burden for patients  and their  families. Moderate to severe AD  is associated with  significant 
burden, impacting sleep, quality of life, and treatment needs.  
The goals of therapy are to reduce pruritus and  establish persistent disease control that  is  sufficient to 
enable patients to be fully functional at home, work and school. These goals typically require a multistep 
approach  with  interventions  that  are  aimed  at  avoiding  relevant triggers,  improving  the  skin  barrier, 
normalizing the skin dysbiosis and reducing inflammation. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need  
Topical  therapies,  e.g.  moisturisers  are  the  mainstay  of  therapy  for  patients  with  mild-to-moderate 
disease. TCS are used as the first-line anti-inflammatory treatment and reduce disease recurrence when 
used intermittently.  Use of low-potency TCS bears low risk, but  inappropriate use of high-potency  TCS 
can cause local side effect such as skin thinning, purpura, striae and dyspigmentation. 
Topical  calcineurin 
inhibitors 
(TCIs) 
tacrolimus  and  pimecrolimus  are  alternative 
topical 
immunomodulators  for  the  treatment  of  AD.  Currently  per  EMA  recommendations,  these  medicines 
should  be only  used in  patients  over the  age of 2  years with  mild  or moderate disease (in  the  case of 
pimecrolimus) and moderate to severe disease (in the case of tacrolimus), when treatment with topical 
corticosteroids should not or cannot be used.  
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023 
Page 200/209 
 
 
 
Other  treatment  options  include  short-term  phototherapy  if  disease cannot  be  controlled  with  topical 
therapies and oral glucocorticoids. Systemic non-biologic immunomodulatory therapies, e.g. ciclosporin, 
azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil are also used, often off-label. Other treatments 
options  for  moderate-to-severe  AD  include  oral  JAK  inhibitors  abrocitinib,  baricitinib,  upadacitinib. 
However, the  use of  JAK  inhibitors  has  been  associated with  some serious side  effects  and  should  be 
used with caution.   
Recently, two  biological therapies have been approved by EMA  for moderate-to-severe AD.  Dupilumab 
is a mAb against  IL-4Rα that  inhibits  IL-4 signalling  via the Type I receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and both  IL-4 
and IL-13  signalling through  the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα).  Tralokinumab is a mAb against IL-
13  that  neutralises  the biological  activity of  IL-13  by blocking  its  interaction  with  the  IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα 
receptor complex.  
Although several therapies have recently become available for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD, 
new therapies that  are effective and safe particularly in the  long-term treatment of this  chronic disease 
are needed.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies  
The clinical development program supporting lebrikizumab for the treatment  of moderate-to-severe AD 
in  adults  and adolescents 12  years of  age and older with  a body weight  of at  least  40  kg and who  are 
candidates for systemic therapy, is primarily based on 3 pivotal trials:  
• 
KGAB  and  KGAC  studies  were  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group 
studies  designed to  confirm the  safety and  efficacy of lebrikizumab in  adults  and  adolescents 
(12  to  less than  18  years of  age that  weighted  at  least  40  kg) with  moderate-to-severe AD. 
Both studies included Induction period (0-16 weeks) and Maintenance period (16-52 weeks). 
• 
KGAD study was a 16-week randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
designed to  evaluate the safety and  efficacy of  lebrikizumab +  TCS compared with  placebo + 
TCS in  adults  and adolescents (12  to  less than  18  years of age that  weighted  at  least 40  kg) 
with  moderate-to-severe AD.  
The co-primary endpoints in all 3 pivotal studies were: 
• 
• 
Percentage of  patients  with  an  IGA score of  0  or 1  and a reduction  ≥2  points  from baseline to 
Week 16. 
Percentage of patients achieving EASI 75 (≥75% reduction from Baseline in EASI score) at Week 
16 
3.2.  Favourable effects  
Lebrikizumab demonstrated a statistically  significant  and clinically relevant improvements over placebo 
when  used  as  monotherapy  or in  combination  with  TCS.  The  co-primary endpoints,  i.e.  proportion  of 
patients achieving EASI 75 and IGA 0,1 (with ≥2 point reduction from baseline) at Week 16 were met in 
all 3 pivotal studies. 
Based on  the primary analysis using  the “hybrid”  estimand, 43.1%  and 33.2%  of  patients treated with 
lebrikizumab and 12.7%  and 10.8% of patients  treated with  placebo achieved IGA 0,1 in the KGAB and 
KGAC studies at Week 16. This translated into a 29.7% (95% CI 21.6, 37.8, p<0.001) and 21.9% (95% 
CI  14.2,  29.6,  p<0.001)  difference from placebo  in  the  KGAB and  KGAC studies,  respectively. 58.8% 
and 52.1% of patients  treated with  lebrikizumab and 16.2% and 18.1% of patients treated with placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023 
Page 201/209 
 
 
 
achieved EASI 75  in  KGAB and  KGAC  studies  at  Week 16.  This  translated  into  a  42%  (95%  CI  33.3, 
50.6,  p<0.001)  and  33.3%  (95%  CI  24.4,  42.2,  p<0.001)  difference from  placebo  in  the  KGAB and 
KGAC studies, respectively.   
In KGAD, 41.2% of patients treated with lebrikizumab + TCS and 22.1% of patients treated with placebo 
+ TCS achieved IGA 0,1 at Week 16. This translated into a 18.3% (95% CI 5.1, 31.5, p=0.011) difference 
from placebo.  69.5%  of  patients  treated  with  lebrikizumab +  TCS  and  42.2%  of  patients  treated  with 
placebo + TCS achieved EASI 75 at Week 16. This translated into a 26.4% (95% CI 12.1, 40.8, p<0.001) 
difference from placebo. 
The  supportive “composite”  estimand yielded similar  results  to  the  primary analysis of the  co-primary 
endpoints.  
For the Induction  Period, the key secondary endpoints in  studies KGAB and KGAC supported the effects 
seen in  the  co-primary endpoints  with  statistically  significant  differences over placebo e.g. in  EASI 90, 
pruritus NRS ≥4 point improvement, sleep loss scale ≥2 improvement and DLQI ≥4 point improvement.   
The  pivotal  studies  included  adults  and  adolescents 12  to  less than  18  years of  age  that  weighted  at 
least 40 kg. The subgroup analysis in adolescent patients provided evidence that lebrikizumab has similar 
or somewhat better  efficacy in adolescents compared to  adult population.  In the  pooled analysis of the 
KGAB and KGAC studies, 46.6%  vs. 14.3%  of the adolescent patients achieved IGA 0,1  and 62.0%  vs. 
17.3%  achieved EASI 75  at Week 16  in lebrikizumab vs. placebo groups,  respectively. In KGAD study, 
57.3%  vs. 28.6%  of  the  of  the  adolescent  patients  achieved IGA 0,1  and 88.0%  vs.  57.1%  achieved 
EASI 75 at Week 16 in lebrikizumab vs. placebo groups, respectively. 
Among IGA 0,1 responders at Week 16 in KGAB and KGAC studies, high proportions in 250 mg Q4W and 
Q2W lebrikizumab groups maintained the response at Week 52 (74.2%  and 75.8% in KGAB, 80.6% and 
64.6%  in  KGAC). Of note,  high  proportions were observed in  placebo (lebrikizumab withdrawal)  group 
as well (46.5% in KGAB and 49.8% in KGAC). 
Among EASI  75  responders at  Week 16  in  KGAB and KGAC studies,  high  proportions  in  250  mg  Q4W 
and  Q2W  lebrikizumab  groups  maintained  the  response  at  Week  52,  i.e.  in  the  Maintenance  period 
(79.2%  and  79.2%  in  KGAB, 84.7%  and 77.4%  in  KGAC). Of note,  high  proportions were observed in 
placebo (lebrikizumab withdrawal) group as well (61.3% in KGAB and 72.0% in KGAC). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
Simulation data suggest that  patients with  adequate initial response may continue to maintain response 
with  250  mg QXW dosing  but there is no clinical data to  confirm this. It  is therefore recommended that 
the  Applicant  conducts  a  clinical  study  that  compares Q4W  vs.  QXW  dosing  during  the  maintenance 
period in subjects who are initial responders at week 16.  
The efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in adolescents weighing <40  kg has not  been demonstrated but 
is being addressed in a clinical study according to the agreed PIP.   
Long-term efficacy data are very limited. A LTE study with planned duration of 100 Weeks is ongoing.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
A total of 1720 participants  (including 372  adolescents) with AD were exposed to any dose of 
lebrikizumab for 1637.02 PY. The dosing regimen proposed for marketing (lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W 
during the first 16  weeks followed by lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W) was administered to 147 participants 
(216.11  PY).

Induction period (weeks 0-16) 
During induction, higher incidences of TEAEs were reported in the lebrikizumab treated subjects than in 
those on placebo in the  following SOCs: Infections and infestations, Eye disorders, and Nervous system 
disorders. Common TAES  reported more frequently in  the  lebrikizumab group  compared to  placebo in 
the 
induction  period  were  conjunctivitis  (6.9%),  nasopharyngitis  (4.4%),  headache  (4.4%), 
conjunctivitis allergic (1.8%), dry eye (1.4%) and rhinitis allergic (1.0%). 
Maintenance period (weeks 16-52) 
In  the  maintenance  period  (weeks  16-52),  the  same TEAEs  were common  and  the  frequencies were 
roughly similar to those seen in the induction period.  
Events  of special interest 
The observed incidence rates of infectious conjunctivitis  were 6.9%  in  the induction  phase and 5.0%  in 
the maintenance phase. Conjunctivitis allergic occurred in 1.8% of LEB treated subjects during induction 
and  5.9%  during  maintenance.  All  events  of  conjunctivitis  were  nonserious  according  to  (ICH)  E2A 
guidelines.  Two  (0.1%)  events  of  conjunctivitis,  and  4  (0.2%)  events  of  conjunctivitis  allergic  were 
classified as  severe (a  severe event is  defined  as an  event  that  prevents  normal everyday activities). 
Most  events of  conjunctivitis  (72.1%)  were reported as  recovered or resolved by the  data  cutoff date. 
Four events of conjunctivitis led to treatment discontinuation.   
Of  the  183  participants  reporting  events  within  the  conjunctivitis  cluster  (conjunctivitis  of  various 
etiologies, that  is, bacterial, viral, allergic),  the majority occurred earlier in  treatment  but  throughout 
the whole 52 weeks of treatment with  the proposed posology (LEB 250 Q2W/Q4W)  the total frequency 
of conjunctivitis was 14.2%  and of conjunctivitis allergic was 6.1%. 
Of  the  1720  AD  patients  with  any  exposure to  lebrikizumab  250  mg  total  of  9  (0.5%)  participants 
reported  14  events  within  the  keratitis  cluster  during  the  whole  study  period.  Five  of  these  events 
occurred during  the induction  period. One (0.9%)  event of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis in  a LEB 
250  mg Q2W participant  led to  treatment discontinuation.  Eleven (0.6%)  participants  reported a  total 
of  13  events  of  blepharitis.  Seven of  these  events  occurred during  the  induction  period. One  severe 
event of blepharitis was noted. None led to treatment discontinuation. 
In  the  induction  period,  the  frequency  of  TEAE  Infections  and  infestations  was  higher  in  LEB  250  mg 
Q2W  arm  compared  to  placebo  (21.2%  vs  18.6%).  This  was  primarily  driven  by  conjunctivitis  and 
nasopharyngitis. The exposure adjusted  incidence rate with  LEB  250mg Q2W  was lower than  that  with 
placebo.  
Although the combined incidence of all herpes infections was balanced between treatment groups, herpes 
zoster and herpes simplex infections were more common with lebrikizumab compared to placebo. Herpes 
zoster occurred in 5 (0.6%)  patients treated with LEB compared to 0 patients  in the placebo arm during 
induction.  Herpes simplex occurred in  2 (0.3%) patients  treated with LEB compared to 0  patients in the 
placebo arm during  induction.  No  eczema herpeticum  events were reported  in  the  lebrikizumab group 
compared to  3  (0.7%)  events  in  the  placebo  group. All  herpes  infection  events  were  nonserious and 
none led to treatment discontinuation. 
From  baseline to  Week 16,  the  frequency of  participants  with  increased blood eosinophils  at  any time 
point  post-baseline  was  higher  in  lebrikizumab-treated  participants  (20.3%)  compared  to  placebo-
treated  participants  (11.7%).  TE  eosinophilia  AEs  were  reported  at  a  similar  frequency  in  the 
lebrikizumab group (0.6%)  compared to  placebo (0.8%).  A shift  to severely elevated eosinophil levels 
(greater  than  5000  cells/mm3)  was  detected  in  3  lebrikizumab-treated  participants  (0.4%)  and  0 
placebo-treated participants during induction treatment. The eosinophilia was transient and did not result 
in discontinuation.  No eosinophil-related disorder AEs were reported.

In the induction period, frequency of immediate hypersensitivity reactions was lower in LEB 250mg Q2W 
(n=22,  2.8%)  compared  to  placebo  (n=25,  6.2%).  In  the  maintenance  period,  the  frequency  of 
immediate hypersensitivity reactions was slightly higher in both lebrikizumab arms although the number 
of events is very small. No serious events of immediate hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis were reported in 
the AD  program. 
As  for  nonimmediate  hypersensitivity,  in  the  induction  period,  the  frequencies  of  nonimmediate 
hypersensitivity events were lower in  the lebrikizumab group (n = 77, 9.9%)  compared to placebo (n = 
69, 17.1%),  while in the maintenance period the frequencies were similar in LEB Q4W and placebo (n = 
17, 14.4%  and n = 8, 13.3%,  respectively). 
The  frequency of  non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions  in  adolescents receiving lebrikizumab Q4W 
is  17.6%  in  the maintenance  period and 20.7%  in  any LEB  exposure set  compared to adults  receiving 
the same dosing regimen (13.9%  in maintenance and 10.2% in any LEB exposure) and higher compared 
to  adolescents  receiving  placebo  (12.5%  in  maintenance)  or  adolescents  receiving  LEB  Q2W  (0  in 
maintenance and 14.3% in any LEB exposure set).  
The  incidence of  injection  site  reactions  was  higher  in  the  lebrikizumab-treated  group  (n=20,  2.6%) 
compared to placebo (n=6,  1.5%) during  the induction  period but  decreased over time and was similar 
between  groups  during  maintenance.  All  events  were  nonserious.  One  (0.1%)  event  of  injection  site 
dermatitis  which  occurred within  a  month  was  severe and  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.  Another 
participant  discontinued  treatment  due  to  injection  site  rash,  which  occurred within  15  days of  study 
drug administration. 
Serious adverse events 
In total  4 deaths  were recorded during  the AD  lebrikizumab clinical programme. One death occurred in 
placebo  arm  while  3  deaths  occurred  in  patients  receiving  lebrikizumab  250  mg  Q2W.  Investigators 
assessed all deaths as unrelated to study drug treatments.  
The frequency of participants reporting at least 1 SAE was low and similar in the lebrikizumab and placebo 
groups during both  the induction  and maintenance period (below 2%).  During  induction, frequencies of 
SAEs were similar for both treatment arms regardless of concomitant TCS. No SAE was reported by more 
than 1 participant  in each treatment group during induction.  
Serious  infections  occurred  in  two  patients  during  the  induction  period:  one  (0.2%)  placebo-treated 
participant 2  serious events of cellulitis of the  right extremity and sepsis and one (0.1%)  lebrikizumab-
treated participant reported a serious event of severe infectious colitis. Of the 1720 AD patients with  any 
exposure to lebrikizumab 250 mg an additional two  cases of COVID-19, one case of acarodermatitis and 
erysipelas and  one case of  pneumonia were classified as  serious infections.  All serious infections  were 
recovered/resolved and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. 
Immunogenicity 
In the combined phase 3 Studies KGAB, KGAC and KGAD, 3.4% of participants treated with lebrikizumab 
250 mg  Q2W,  2.8%  of  participants  treated  with  lebrikizumab  250 mg  Q2W/Q4W,  and  0.9%  of 
participants treated with placebo developed treatment-emergent ADA over 12 months. Nearly all TE ADA 
positive  participants  were  also  positive  for  NAb  to  lebrikizumab  but  most  ADAs  were  low  titre  (only 
2 participants  had  maximum titres  of  1:320  and  1:640,  respectively). ADA/Nab  frequencies and  titres 
were similar in the adolescents compared to the overall population.

Special populations 
There  were 53  participants  older than  65  and  15  participants  older  than  75  exposed  to  lebrikizumab 
during  the  induction  period.  There were  99  adolescents  exposed to  lebrikizumab  during  the  induction 
period.  
There were 270  adolescents exposed to any dose of lebrikizumab for at least 1 year. The total  number 
of adolescents with  AD exposed to any dose of lebrikizumab is 372. In the induction period overall SAEs, 
TEAEs,  discontinuations  and  TEAEs  within  special  safety  topics  all  occurred  with  lower  frequency  in 
adolescents compared to adults in both  lebrikizumab and placebo groups. Regarding weight, height and 
BMI  in  adolescents,  the  mean  changes  in  any  LEB  group  for  Z-score  was  close  to  0  for  all  growth 
parameters. 
The overall safety profile in all adolescents exposed to any dose of lebrikizumab was consistent with the 
safety profile in adults in terms of frequency and nature of adverse events. The most common TEAEs in 
adolescents  occurring  more  frequently  in  the  lebrikizumab-treated  adolescents  compared  to  placebo 
were conjunctivitis, nasopharyngitis, dry eye, and rhinitis allergic. 
There is limited amount of data from the use of lebrikizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate  direct  or  indirect  harmful  effects  with  respect  to  reproductive  toxicity.  As  a  precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of tralokinumab during pregnancy.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects  
The ADR  list  is generated based only on  the first  16  weeks of treatment  (the  induction  period). This is 
acceptable as only the  induction  period enabled comparison to  true placebo and as no new information 
on the nature, frequency, severity or causal relationship of events is evident from the long-term data.  
The long-term safety profile of lebrikizumab has not  been fully  characterised as long-term  safety study 
in  AD  patients  is  ongoing.  The  M-17923-32  study  on  long-term  safety and  efficacy of  lebrikizumab in 
adult  and adolescent patients  with  moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis will  provide further long-term 
data. Long-term safety is listed as a missing information in the safety concerns in the RMP.  
Lebrikizumab  has  not  been  studied  in  pregnant  or  breastfeeding  women,  and  no  information  on  the 
excretion of lebrikizumab in  human milk or effects on the  nursing infant  is available. There is  currently 
insufficient  clinical  data  available  to  draw  conclusions  about  the  safety  of  using  lebrikizumab  during 
pregnancy. Animal studies have not shown any effects on male and female reproductive organs and on 
sperm count,  motility, and morphology. As a precautionary measure, it  is preferable to avoid the use of 
lebrikizumab during  pregnancy (section  4.6  of  SmPC). Use  in  pregnant  and  breastfeeding women  has 
been added as a missing information in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. The safety of lebrikizumab 
us in pregnant and breastfeeding women will be monitored in an observational PASS.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Although several therapies have recently become available for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD, 
new therapies that  are effective and safe particularly in the  long-term treatment  setting  of this  chronic 
disease are needed. 
In the current marketing authorisation application, the applicant has clearly demonstrated the beneficial 
treatment effect of lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W (with  loading doses) as monotherapy and in combination 
with  TCS  in  patients  with  a  chronic  moderate-to-severe AD,  whose  disease is  inadequately  controlled 
with  topical medication.  The favourable effects seen in the  co-primary endpoints  were both  statistically 
significant and clinically relevant in both adults and adolescent population studied.  
Importantly,  in addition  to  the  investigator-assessed endpoints  IGA 0,1  and  EASI 75  that  are to  some 
extent overlapping measures, beneficial effects were also seen in patient-reported outcomes, including 
pruritus  NRS,  DLQI  and  sleep-loss  scale  that  measures the  interference  of  itch  on  sleep.  Supportive 
evidence of effectiveness of  lebrikizumab was provided by several other  efficacy endpoints included  in 
the pivotal studies. 
In terms of long-term treatment, the beneficial effect of lebrikizumab was well maintained up to 52 weeks 
in patients that  achieved IGA 0,1 and/or EASI 75 at week 16. Some patients with initial  partial response 
at week 16 benefit from continuation of the induction dose Q2W up to week 24. The Q4W dosing seemed 
as effective as Q2W  dosing after induction  period and  appears to  be the  preferred dosing  in long-term 
treatment.  
In  relation to  safety,  the  number and  total  exposure of AD  patients  treated  with  the  intended  dose  of 
lebrikizumab is sufficient  and  thus,  the  safety profile has been sufficiently  characterised. Lebrikizumab 
was well tolerated and has a similar safety profile in  both adults  and adolescents ≥12  years of age and 
≥40kg. 
Overall, the  safety profile for lebrikizumab is manageable. No  clinically meaningful differences in safety 
were  observed  between  different  lebrikizumab  dosing  regimens  (Q2W  vs.  Q4W  in  the  maintenance 
phase).  No  differences  in  AE  pattern  were  seen  between  monotherapy  and  lebrikizumab  +  topical 
treatment. 
Patients with AD are known to be at an increased risk for clinically important co-morbidities such as skin 
infections,  herpes infections,  conjunctivitis,  depression and sleep disorders. The risk for skin infections 
and conjunctivitis was reflected in the overall incidence of adverse events. 
The  overall safety  profile  of  lebrikizumab is  overall acceptable and  considered manageable. The  data 
suggest that most AEs occur within  the first few months  of drug treatment and that the AE pattern does 
not change over time, although some commonly occurring events such as conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis 
allergic  expectedly  had  higher  incidences  with  longer  follow-up.  The  immunogenicity  and  allergic 
potential of lebrikizumab is low. 
Safety data are appropriately reported in the product information. 
Further data on long term safety of lebrikizumab in AD will be provided post-approval (category 3 
PASS, see RMP).

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks  
The  efficacy  of  lebrikizumab for  the  treatment  of  moderate-to-severe atopic  dermatitis  in  adults  and 
adolescents  12  years of  age  and  older  with  a  body  weight  of  at  least  40  kg  who  are  candidates  for 
systemic  therapy has  been  demonstrated.  The  risks  associated  with  lebrikizumab  in  the  treatment  of 
moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  in  adults  and adolescents 12  years of age  and older with  a  body 
weight of at least 40 kg who are candidates for systemic therapy have been adequately characterised in 
the  clinical  programme. The  applicant  initially  applied  for the  treatment  of  moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Considering  that  all  subjects  had  a  weight  of  ≥40  kg,  the  final  indication  was  agreed  to  include 
bodyweight.  Overall, based  on  the  data  presented the  beneficial  effects of  lebrikizumab  outweigh  the 
unfavourable effects. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Patient representatives provided their feedback and emphasised the  impact of atopic eczema on quality 
of  life  and  everyday activities  regardless  of  age,  gender,  socioeconomic  or  other  differences.  They 
expressed their perspective on how  the disease can affect people’s lives, starting  from the early years, 
when  caregivers  are  heavily  involved  in  the  disease  management,  throughout  the  adolescence and 
adulthood.  Specifically, they  pointed  out  that  in  clinical  trials, both  men and women  should  be equally 
represented  so  that  safety  and  efficacy  can  be  established  for  each  group.  In  their  view,  it  is  also 
imperative  that  a  new  medicine  is  assessed  by  individuals  from  all  age,  gender,  and  socioeconomic 
groups,  in  an  equal manner.  Further  views on  the  disease and  its  management  that  still  need further 
attention  were also provided.  
The contribution of patient  representatives is highly appreciated. 
3.8.  Conclusions  
The overall benefit/risk balance of Ebglyss is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that  the benefit-risk balance of Ebglyss is favourable in the following indication(s): 
“Ebglyss is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and 
adolescents 12 years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg who are candidates for systemic 
therapy”. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding  supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2) 
Assessment report  
EMA/453942/2023 
Page 208/209 
 
 
 
Other  conditions and requirements  of the marketing  authorisation  
•  Periodic  Safety  Update  Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC  and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within  6 months following  authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard  to the safe and effective  use of the medicinal  product 
•  Risk Management  Plan  (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New  Active  Substance  Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that lebrikizumab is to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within  the European Union. 
Paediatric  Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0286/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

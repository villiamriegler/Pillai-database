SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of the data, the CHMP concluded that 
order to include a proposed dose adjustment for 
II and PL 
the dose of Carbaglu must be reduced in patients with renal 
patients with impaired renal function based on final 
results from study RCD-P0-027; this is a Phase I, 
multicenter, open-label, parallel-group adaptive 
pharmacokinetic single dose study of oral Carbaglu in 
impairment. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

impaired renal function. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. The RMP version 2.3 has also 
been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes in Annex

The CHMP reviewed the evidence of compliance with the 
PL 
Specific obligations submitted by the MAH and re-assessed 
the benefit/risk profile for Carbaglu.  On the basis of the 
data submitted since the Marketing Authorisation, the 
benefit/risk for Carbaglu in the treatment of 
hyperammonaemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase 
deficiency remained positive. 
The CHMP therefore recommended the updating of the 
Community Marketing Authorisation for Carbaglu and that 
the authorisation should remain under exceptional 
circumstances.

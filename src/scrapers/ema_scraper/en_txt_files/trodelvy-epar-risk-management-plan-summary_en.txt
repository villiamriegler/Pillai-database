SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR TRODELVY 
(SACITUZUMAB GOVITECAN) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for TRODELVY. The RMP details 
important risks of TRODELVY, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about TRODELVY’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
TRODELVY’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how TRODELVY should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for TRODELVY should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
TRODELVY’s RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What Is It Used For
TRODELVY is authorized as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable 
or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received two or more prior 
systemic therapies, including at least one of them for advanced disease and for the treatment of 
adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative 
breast cancer who have received endocrine-based therapy, and at least two additional systemic 
therapies in the advanced setting (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains sacituzumab 
govitecan as the active substance and it is given as an intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of TRODELVY’s benefits can be found in 
TRODELVY’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/trodelvy. 
II.
Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further
Characterise the Risks
Important risks of TRODELVY, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about TRODELVY’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL and
SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment, so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of TRODELVY is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of TRODELVY are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of TRODELVY. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine);

Summary of Important Risks 
TRODELVY has been assigned the legal status of a medicine subject to medical prescription in 
the European Union (EU), whereby therapy should only be prescribed and administered by a 
healthcare professional experienced in the use of anti-cancer therapies (as described in section 
4.2 of the SmPC).

measures 
In the clinical studies 67.6% of 688 patients had neutropenia and in 50.7% of patients 
the neutropenia was severe. The dose of sacituzumab govitecan (SG) was interrupted 
in 44.2% and reduced in 12.4% of patients. Three patients (0.4%) discontinued SG 
because of neutropenia. 
Infections potentially associated with neutropenia occurred in 10.6% of 688 patients in 
the Overall Targeted metastatic breast cancer (mBC) population. Serious infections 
potentially associated with neutropenia occurred in 2.8% of 688 patients.  
The dose of SG was interrupted in 1.5% of patients, reduced in 0.4% of patients, and 
was discontinued in 0.3% of patients. 
Neutropenia was one of the main toxicities seen in animal studies.  
Clinical studies can provide an estimation of the frequency and nature of a side effect 
that is expected to occur in clinical practice. Findings from studies in animals may be 
relevant for humans and in the absence of data in humans suggest a potential safety 
concern that awaits clinical confirmation. 
Risk factors for neutropenia caused by cancer chemotherapies include increasing age, 
abnormal liver enzyme laboratory values, female gender, underweight, radiation 
therapy to the bone marrow, type of prior chemotherapy, and type of current treatment 
{Fontanella 2014}. 
When SG is metabolised in the body, the active metabolite SN-38 is inactivated by an 
enzyme called uridine 5'-diphospho (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Patients 
with reduced activity of this enzyme, such as patients who are homozygous for the 
*28 allele of UGT1A1, who are treated with SG have an increased risk of neutropenia 
and accordingly, an increased risk of serious infection. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
•  Dose modifications based on severity and occurrence in SmPC section 4.2 
•  Warnings of severe or life-threatening neutropenia, including fatal infections in 
the setting of neutropenia observed in clinical studies, in SmPC section 4.4 
•  Warning for UGT1A1*28 allele homozygous patients in SmPC section 4.4 
•  Adverse reaction in SmPC section 4.8 
•  Guidance for treating severe neutropenia relating to overdose in SmPC section 4.9 
•  Warning in PL section 2 
•  Side effect in PL section 4 
•  Restricted medical prescription  
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
•  None 
Important identified 
risk 
Severe diarrhoea 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Severe diarrhoea occurred in 10.3% of 688 patients treated with SG in the clinical 
studies. The dose of SG was interrupted in 3.6% patients and reduced in 6.5% 
patients; and was discontinued in 0.3% of patients because of severe diarrhoea. 
Gastrointestinal disturbance was one of the main toxicities seen in animal studies. 
Clinical studies can provide an estimation of the frequency and nature of a side effect 
that is expected to occur in clinical practice. Findings from studies in animals may be 
relevant for humans and in the absence of data in humans suggest a potential safety 
concern that awaits clinical confirmation. 
Diarrhoea caused by SG may have similar risk factors as irinotecan because SN-38, 
once released from SG, is expected to be metabolised and excreted in the same way as 
SN-38 from irinotecan. 
The main clinical predictive factors for irinotecan-related diarrhoea are weekly 
administration, poor performance status, high levels of creatinine in blood, previous 
abdominopelvic radiotherapy, low leukocyte counts, age over 70 years, and two 
inherited conditions (Gilbert disease and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1) {Stein 
2010}. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
•  Dose modifications based on severity and occurrence in SmPC section 4.2 
•  Warning of severe diarrhoea, in some cases was observed to have led to 
dehydration and subsequent acute kidney injury, and recommendation for 
medication/supportive measures in SmPC section 4.4

Risk minimisation 
measures 
In the clinical studies 33.0% of 688 patients treated with SG developed 
hypersensitivity, and in 1.7% patients the hypersensitivity was severe. The dose of SG 
was interrupted in 1.0% patients and 0.1% patients had to permanently discontinue SG 
treatment. There were no dose reductions related to hypersensitivity. 
Animal studies showed that SG was well tolerated.  
Clinical studies can provide an estimation of the frequency and nature of a side effect 
that is expected to occur in clinical practice. Findings from studies in animals may be 
relevant for humans and in the absence of data in humans suggest a potential safety 
concern that awaits clinical confirmation. 
Risk factors for drug hypersensitivity reactions can be related to the medicine itself, 
to the characteristics of the individual patient receiving the medicine, and to other 
ongoing diseases.  
Medicine-related factors include metabolic products/cytotoxicity, high-dose and 
prolonged therapy, exposure to cross-reactive epitopes, repeated treatments with the 
same medicine, intravenous route of administration, and when multiple other 
medicines are used at the same time.  
Patient-related factors include a previous history with the same medicine or other 
similar medicines, multiple drug allergy syndrome, family history of hypersensitivity, 
female gender, and genetic factors. Illnesses such as infections (eg, human 
immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) and long-term diseases (eg, long-term kidney disease, 
heart diseases and malignancies) may also have an important influence on the 
development of allergic reactions to medicines by altering metabolic pathways and 
making changes to how the body’s immune cells respond to medicines {Gomes 
2017}. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
•  Guidance and warning for patient monitoring in SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4, 
respectively 
•  Contraindication in SmPC section 4.3 and PL section 2 
•  Warning for severe hypersensitivity in SmPC section 4.4 
•  Warning that pre-infusion treatment is recommended in SmPC section 4.4 
•  Adverse reaction in SmPC section 4.8 
•  Warning in PL section 2 
•  Side effect in PL section 4

Risk minimisation 
measures 
Use of SG during pregnancy has not been evaluated in the clinical studies and there 
are limited data available for SG exposure in pregnant women. However, SG contains 
a component that is toxic to rapidly dividing cells. Based on its mechanism of action, 
SG can cause malformations or death in the unborn child when administered to a 
pregnant woman.  
Findings from studies in animals may be relevant for humans and in the absence of 
data in humans suggest a potential safety concern that awaits clinical confirmation. 
Women in their reproductive years and men with female partners in their reproductive 
years who are not using an effective method of contraception during treatment with 
SG and for 6 months and 3 months, respectively, after the last dose are at risk of 
toxicity to the unborn child. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
•  Warning and information of the risk of teratogenicity and/or embryo-foetal 
lethality in SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.6, respectively 
•  Warning and recommendation to verify the pregnancy status of women of 
childbearing potential prior to use in SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.6, respectively 
•  Recommendation in the case of pregnancy to immediately contact the doctor in 
SmPC section 4.6 
•  Recommendation for use of effective contraception during treatment and for up 
to 6 months after the last dose for female patients and up to 3 months after the 
last dose for male patients with female partners of childbearing potential in 
SmPC section 4.6

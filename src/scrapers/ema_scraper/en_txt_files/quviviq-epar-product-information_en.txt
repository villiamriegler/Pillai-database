CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
QUVIVIQ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with insomnia characterised by symptoms 
present for at least 3 months and considerable impact on daytime functioning. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose for adults is one tablet of 50 mg once per night, taken orally in the evening 
within 30 minutes before going to bed. Based on clinical judgement, some patients may be treated 
with 25 mg once per night (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
The maximum daily dose is 50 mg.  
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The treatment duration should be as short as possible. The appropriateness of continued treatment 
should be assessed within 3 months and periodically thereafter. Clinical data are available for up to 
12 months of continuous treatment. 
Treatment can be stopped without down-titration. 
Missed dose 
If a patient forgets to take QUVIVIQ at bedtime, that dose should not be taken during the night. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is required. In patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment, the recommended dose is one tablet of 25 mg once per night (see section 5.2). In 
patients with severe hepatic impairment, daridorexant has not been studied and is not recommended 
(see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment (including severe), no dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). 
Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors  
The recommended dose when used with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is one tablet of 25 mg once per 
night (see section 4.5). 
The consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice in the evening should be avoided. 
Co-administration with central nervous system (CNS) depressants 
In the case of co-administration with CNS-depressant medicinal products, dose adjustments of 
QUVIVIQ and/or the other medicinal products may be required, based on clinical evaluation, due to 
potentially additive effects (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (> 65 years). Limited data are available in patients 
older than 75 years. No data are available in patients older than 85 years. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of daridorexant in paediatric patients have not yet been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration  
For oral use. 
QUVIVIQ can be taken with or without food. However, taking QUVIVIQ soon after a large meal may 
reduce the effect on sleep onset (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Narcolepsy. 
Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.5).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Elderly 
Because of the general risk of falls in the elderly, daridorexant should be used with caution in this 
population, although clinical studies did not show an increase in the incidence of falls on daridorexant 
compared to placebo. 
QUVIVIQ should be administered with caution in patients older than 75 years since efficacy and 
safety data in this population are limited. 
CNS-depressant effects 
Because daridorexant acts by reducing wakefulness, patients should be cautioned about engaging in 
potentially hazardous activities, driving, or operating heavy machinery unless they feel fully alert, 
especially in the first few days of treatment (see section 4.7).  
Caution should be exercised when prescribing QUVIVIQ concomitantly with CNS-depressant 
medicinal products due to potentially additive effects, and a dose adjustment of either QUVIVIQ or 
the concomitant CNS depressants should be considered. 
Patients should be cautioned about drinking alcohol during treatment with QUVIVIQ (see section 4.5). 
Sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and cataplexy-like symptoms 
Sleep paralysis, an inability to move or speak for up to several minutes during sleep-wake transitions, 
and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, including vivid and disturbing perceptions, can occur 
with daridorexant, mainly during the first weeks of treatment (see section 4.8). 
Symptoms similar to mild cataplexy have been reported with dual orexin receptor antagonists. 
Prescribers should explain the nature of these events to patients when prescribing QUVIVIQ. Should 
such events occur, patients need to be further evaluated and, depending on the nature and severity of 
the events, discontinuation of treatment should be considered. 
Worsening of depression and suicidal ideation  
In primarily depressed patients treated with hypnotics, worsening of depression and suicidal thoughts 
and actions have been reported. As with other hypnotics, QUVIVIQ should be administered with 
caution in patients exhibiting symptoms of depression. 
Isolated cases of suicidal ideation have been reported in Phase 3 clinical studies, in subjects with pre-
existing psychiatric conditions and/or stressful living conditions, across all treatment groups, including 
placebo. Suicidal tendencies may be present in patients with depression and protective measures may 
be required. 
Patients with psychiatric co-morbidities 
QUVIVIQ should be administered with caution in patients with psychiatric co-morbidities since 
efficacy and safety data in this patient population are limited. 
Patients with compromised respiratory function 
Daridorexant did not increase the frequency of apnoea/hypopnoea events or cause oxygen desaturation 
in patients with mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), nor did it cause oxygen 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
desaturation in patients with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Daridorexant 
has not been studied in patients with severe OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index ≥ 30 events per hour) or 
with severe COPD (FEV1 < 40% of predicted).  
Caution should be exercised when prescribing QUVIVIQ to patients with severe OSA and severe 
COPD.  
Potential for abuse and dependence 
There was no evidence of abuse or withdrawal symptoms indicative of physical dependence upon 
treatment discontinuation in clinical studies with daridorexant in subjects with insomnia. 
In an abuse liability study of daridorexant (50, 100 and 150 mg) conducted in non-insomniac 
recreational drug users (n = 72), daridorexant (100 and 150 mg) produced similar “drug liking” ratings 
as zolpidem (30 mg). Because individuals with a history of abuse or addiction to alcohol or other 
substances may be at increased risk for abuse of QUVIVIQ, these patients should be followed 
carefully. 
Hepatic impairment 
Use is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Excipients 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of daridorexant 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of daridorexant 25 mg with the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor 
diltiazem (240 mg once daily) increased daridorexant exposure parameters AUC and Cmax by 2.4 times 
and 1.4 times, respectively. In patients taking moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, 
ciprofloxacin, cyclosporine), the recommended dose of QUVIVIQ is 25 mg.  
No clinical study was conducted with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Concomitant use of QUVIVIQ with 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
The consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice in the evening should be avoided. 
CYP3A4 inducers 
In healthy subjects, co-administration with efavirenz (600 mg once daily), a moderate CYP3A4 
inducer, decreased daridorexant exposure parameters AUC and Cmax by 61% and 35%, respectively.  
Based on these results, concomitant use with a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducer substantially 
decreases exposure to daridorexant, which may reduce efficacy. 
Gastric pH-modifiers 
The solubility of daridorexant is pH-dependent. In healthy subjects, co-administration with famotidine 
(40 mg), an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion, decreased daridorexant Cmax by 39% while AUC 
remained unchanged.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No dose adjustment is required when QUVIVIQ is used concomitantly with treatments that reduce 
gastric acidity. 
Citalopram 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of 20 mg citalopram, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor 
(SSRI), did not have any clinically relevant effect on the PK of 50 mg daridorexant.  
Effect of daridorexant on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
Substrates of CYP3A4 
In a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects receiving daridorexant and midazolam, a sensitive 
CYP3A4 substrate, daridorexant at a dose of 25 mg did not affect the PK of midazolam, indicating an 
absence of CYP3A4 induction or inhibition at this dose. In a clinical study conducted in healthy 
subjects receiving 50 mg daridorexant and midazolam, exposure (AUC) to midazolam increased by 
42%, indicating a mild CYP3A4 inhibition. Simultaneous administration of 50 mg QUVIVIQ with 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., high-dose simvastatin, tacrolimus) 
should be handled with caution. In the same study, daridorexant 50 mg administered for 7 days did not 
induce CYP3A4, therefore contraceptives can be co-administered with QUVIVIQ. 
Substrates of CYP2C9 
In a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects receiving daridorexant and warfarin, a sensitive 
CYP2C9 substrate, daridorexant at a dose of 50 mg did not affect the PK and PD of warfarin, 
indicating an absence of effect on CYP2C9. CYP2C9 substrates can be administered with QUVIVIQ 
without dose adjustment. 
Substrates of BCRP or P-gp transporters 
In clinical studies conducted in healthy subjects receiving 25 mg and 50 mg daridorexant and 
rosuvastatin, a BCRP substrate, daridorexant did not affect the PK of rosuvastatin, indicating an 
absence of inhibition of BCRP. BCRP substrates can be administered with QUVIVIQ without dose 
adjustment. 
In a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects receiving daridorexant 50 mg and dabigatran 
etexilate, a sensitive P-gp substrate, dabigatran AUC and Cmax increased by 42% and 29%, 
respectively, indicating a mild P-gp inhibition. Simultaneous administration of QUVIVIQ with P-gp 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin) should be handled with caution.  
Alcohol 
In healthy subjects, concomitant intake with alcohol led to a prolonged absorption of daridorexant (tmax 
increased by 1.25 h). Daridorexant exposure (Cmax and AUC) and t½ were unchanged. 
Citalopram 
In healthy subjects, the PK of citalopram at steady state was not affected by co-administration of 
50 mg daridorexant. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Alcohol 
Co-administration of 50 mg daridorexant with alcohol led to additive effects on psychomotor 
performance. 
Citalopram 
No relevant interaction on psychomotor performance was observed when 50 mg daridorexant was 
co-administered with 20 mg citalopram in healthy subjects at steady state. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of daridorexant in pregnant women. Animal studies did not indicate 
harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Consequently, QUVIVIQ should be used during pregnancy only if the clinical condition of the 
pregnant woman requires treatment with daridorexant. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether daridorexant or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in 
animals have shown excretion of daridorexant and its metabolites in milk (see section 5.3).  
A risk of excessive somnolence to the breastfed infant cannot be excluded. A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from QUVIVIQ therapy, taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data concerning the effect of exposure to daridorexant on human fertility. Animal studies 
indicate no impact on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Hypnotics have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
A randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, cross-over study evaluated the effects of 
nighttime administration of daridorexant on next-morning driving performance, using a driving 
simulator, 9 hours after dosing in non-insomniac, healthy subjects aged from 50 to 79 years. Testing 
was conducted after 1 night (initial dosing) and after 4 consecutive nights of treatment with 
daridorexant 50 mg. Zopiclone 7.5 mg was used as an active comparator. 
In the morning after first-dose administration, daridorexant impaired simulated driving performance as 
measured by the Standard Deviation of the Lateral Position (SDLP). No effect on driving performance 
was detected after 4 consecutive nights of administration. Zopiclone significantly impaired simulated 
driving performance at both time points.  
Patients should be cautioned about engaging in potentially hazardous activities, driving, or operating 
heavy machinery unless they feel fully alert, especially in the first few days of treatment (see 
section 4.4). In order to minimise this risk, a period of approximately 9 hours is recommended 
between taking QUVIVIQ and driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache and somnolence.  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity. No evidence of a dose-
relationship for the frequency or severity of adverse reactions was observed. The adverse reaction 
profile in elderly subjects was consistent with younger subjects. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 1 shows adverse reactions that occurred in Study 1 and Study 2. 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very 
rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
The safety of daridorexant was evaluated in three placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical studies. A total 
of 1847 subjects (including approximately 40% elderly subjects [≥ 65 years old]) received 
daridorexant 50 mg (N = 308); 25 mg (N = 618); or 10 mg (N = 306), or placebo (N = 615). A total of 
576 subjects were treated with daridorexant for at least 6 months and 331 for at least 12 months.

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Somnolence 
Somnolence was reported in 3% and 2% of subjects treated with daridorexant 25 mg and 50 mg, 
respectively, compared to 2% of subjects on placebo. 
Sleep paralysis and hallucinations 
Sleep paralysis was reported in 0.5% and 0.3% subjects receiving daridorexant 25 mg and 50 mg, 
respectively, compared to no reports for placebo. Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations were 
reported in 0.6% subjects receiving daridorexant 25 mg compared to no cases with daridorexant 50 mg 
or placebo. Sleep paralysis and hallucinations occur mainly during the first weeks of treatment. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical pharmacology studies, healthy subjects were administered single doses of up to 200 mg 
daridorexant (4 times the recommended dose). At supra-therapeutic doses, adverse reactions of 
somnolence, muscular weakness, disturbance in attention, fatigue, headache, and constipation were 
observed.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no specific antidote to an overdose of daridorexant. In the event of an overdose, general 
symptomatic and supportive medical care should be provided and patients should be carefully 
monitored. Dialysis is unlikely to be effective as daridorexant is highly protein-bound.  
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned, ATC code: not yet assigned 
Mechanism of action 
Daridorexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist, acting on both orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors and 
equipotent on both. The orexin neuropeptides (orexin A and orexin B) act on orexin receptors to 
promote wakefulness. Daridorexant antagonises the activation of orexin receptors by the orexin 
neuropeptides and consequently decreases the wake drive, allowing sleep to occur, without altering the 
proportion of sleep stages (as assessed by electroencephalographic recording in rodents or 
polysomnography in patients with insomnia). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of daridorexant was evaluated in two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3 studies, Study 1 and Study 2, which were identical in design. 
A total of 1854 subjects with insomnia disorder (dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, for at 
least 3 months, with clinically significant distress or impairment in daytime functioning) were 
randomised to receive daridorexant or placebo once daily, in the evening, for 3 months. Study 1 
randomised 930 subjects to daridorexant 50 mg (N = 310), 25 mg (N = 310), or placebo (N = 310). 
Study 2 randomised 924 subjects to daridorexant 25 mg (N = 309), 10 mg (N = 307), or placebo 
(N = 308). At baseline, the proportion of subjects with an Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score between 
8–14, 15–21, and 22–28, was 12%, 58%, and 30%, respectively. 
At the end of the 3-month treatment period, both confirmatory studies included a 7-day placebo 
run-out period, after which subjects could enter a 9-month double-blind, placebo-controlled extension 
study (Study 3). A total of 576 subjects were treated with daridorexant for at least 6 months of 
cumulative treatment, including 331 treated for at least 12 months. 
In Study 1, subjects had a mean age of 55.4 years (range 18 to 88 years), with 39.1% of subjects 
≥ 65 years of age, including 5.8% ≥ 75 years of age. The majority were female (67.1%). 
In Study 2, subjects had a mean age of 56.7 years (range 19 to 85 years), with 39.3% of subjects 
≥ 65 years of age, including 6.1% ≥ 75 years of age. The majority were female (69.0%). 
Primary efficacy endpoints for both studies were the change from baseline to Month 1 and Month 3 in 
Latency to Persistent Sleep (LPS) and Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO), measured objectively by 
polysomnography in a sleep laboratory. LPS is a measure of sleep induction and WASO is a measure 
of sleep maintenance. 
Secondary endpoints included in the statistical testing hierarchy with Type 1 error control were 
patient-reported Total Sleep Time (sTST), evaluated every morning at home using a Sleep Diary 
Questionnaire (SDQ), and patient-reported daytime functioning, assessed using the sleepiness domain 
of the Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire (IDSIQ), every evening at home. The 
IDSIQ total score, Alert/cognition, and Mood domain scores were also evaluated to complete the 
assessment of daytime functioning.

Effect of daridorexant on sleep and daytime functioning 
Across the two studies, the efficacy of daridorexant increased with increasing dose on objective (LPS, 
WASO) and subjective (sTST) sleep variables as well as on daytime functioning as assessed by IDSIQ 
scores, both at Month 1 and Month 3. 
In Study 1, the 50 mg dose showed statistically significant (p < 0.001) improvements compared to 
placebo on all primary and secondary endpoints. For the 25 mg dose, statistical significance was 
consistently achieved on WASO and sTST across both studies, and on LPS in Study 1. The 10 mg 
dose was not effective. 
The efficacy of daridorexant was similar across subgroups based on age, sex, race and region.

Rebound insomnia 
The potential for rebound insomnia was assessed during the placebo run-out period after 3 months of 
treatment with daridorexant in Study 1 and Study 2, looking at the change from baseline to the run-out 
period in LPS, WASO and sTST. At the recommended dose of 50 mg, for all three endpoints, the 
mean values at run-out were improved compared to baseline (–15, –3 and 43 min for LPS, WASO and 
sTST, respectively), indicating that no sign of rebound insomnia was observed upon treatment 
discontinuation. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
daridorexant in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in insomnia (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Daridorexant is rapidly absorbed following oral administration and reaches peak plasma 
concentrations within 1–2 h. At an oral dose of 100 mg, daridorexant has an absolute bioavailability of 
62%. 
Daridorexant plasma exposure is dose proportional between 25 and 50 mg.  
Effect of food 
In healthy subjects, food did not affect total exposure. The tmax of 50 mg daridorexant was delayed by 
1.3 h and Cmax decreased by 16% following administration of a high-fat and high-calorie meal.  
Distribution 
Daridorexant has a volume of distribution of 31 L. Daridorexant is extensively bound (99.7%) to 
plasma proteins, mostly to albumin and to a lower extent to α-acid glycoprotein. The blood to plasma 
ratio is 0.64. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Daridorexant undergoes extensive metabolism and is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 (89%). Other 
CYP enzymes are not of clinical relevance and individually contribute to less than 3% of metabolic 
clearance. None of the major human metabolites (M1, M3, and M10) contribute to the 
pharmacological effect of the medicinal product. 
Daridorexant inhibits several CYP enzymes in vitro. The strongest inhibition was seen on CYP3A4 
with a Ki of 4.6–4.8 µM (see section 4.5). Inhibition of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 was less 
pronounced, with IC50 values in the range of 8.2–19 µM. Daridorexant induces CYP3A4 mRNA 
expression in human hepatocytes with an EC50 of 2.3 µM and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C9 and 
CYP2B6. Up-regulation of all CYP enzymes is mediated via activation of the PXR receptor with an 
EC50 of 3 µM. Daridorexant does not induce CYP1A2.  
Daridorexant inhibits various transporters in vitro and had the strongest inhibitory effect on BCRP 
with an IC50 of 3.0 µM (see section 4.5). Inhibition of other transporters including OATP, OAT3, 
OCT1, MATE-2K, MATE1, and P-gp/MDR1 was less pronounced, with IC50 values ranging from 
8.4–71 µM. 
Elimination 
The primary route of excretion is via faeces (approximately 57%), followed by urine (approximately 
28%). Only traces of parent compound were found in urine and faeces. 
The terminal half-life of daridorexant is approximately 8 hours.  
The PK profile of daridorexant following multiple-dose administration showed similar PK parameters 
to those observed after single-dose administration. No accumulation was observed. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
No clinically significant differences in the PK of daridorexant were detected based on age, sex, race, 
or body size. Limited PK data are available in patients older than 75 years.  
Hepatic impairment 
Following administration of a single dose of 25 mg daridorexant, subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh score 5–6) had a similar exposure to unbound daridorexant compared to 
healthy subjects. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7–9), exposure to 
unbound daridorexant (AUC) and half-life increased by 1.6 times and 2.1 times, respectively, 
compared to healthy subjects. 
Based on these results, a dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.2).  
In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥ 10), daridorexant has not been studied 
and is not recommended.  
Renal impairment 
Following administration of a single dose of 25 mg, the PK parameters of daridorexant were similar in 
subjects with severe renal impairment compared to healthy subjects.  
Based on these results, daridorexant can be administered to patients with any degree of renal function 
impairment without the need for dose adjustment. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and 
development. Daridorexant also showed no signs indicative of abuse potential or physical dependence. 
No adverse effects were observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs at exposures that are 
72 times and 14 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 
50 mg/day.  
In dogs under positive stimulation at play, episodes of sudden muscle weakness, reminiscent of 
cataplexy, were observed as exaggerated pharmacological effects of daridorexant from Week 7 
onwards and did not occur after treatment cessation. An overall no-observed-effect level was 
established at exposures that are 45 times (females) and 78 times (males) the human exposure at 50 
mg/day for the free fraction.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What QUVIVIQ is and what it is used for 
QUVIVIQ contains the active substance daridorexant, which belongs to the class of medicines called 
“orexin receptor antagonists”.  
QUVIVIQ is to treat insomnia in adults. 
How QUVIVIQ works 
Orexin is a substance produced by the brain that helps keep you awake. By blocking the action of 
orexin, QUVIVIQ enables you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, and improves your ability to 
function normally during the day. 
2.  What you need to know before you take QUVIVIQ 
Do not take QUVIVIQ 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to daridorexant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have narcolepsy, a condition that causes you to suddenly and unexpectedly fall asleep at 
any time. 
if you are taking medicines which may increase the level of QUVIVIQ in your blood such as: 
- 
oral medicines to treat fungal infections such as ketoconazole, posaconazole, 
voriconazole, itraconazole. 
certain medicines to treat bacterial infections such as the antibiotics clarithromycin, 
josamycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin. 
certain medicines to treat HIV infection such as ritonavir, elvitegravir, indinavir, 
saquinavir, telaprevir, danoprevir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir.  
- 
- 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
certain medicines to treat cancer such as ceritinib, idelalisib, ribociclib, tucatinib. 
- 
Ask your doctor if the medicine you are taking prevents you from taking QUVIVIQ. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking QUVIVIQ if you: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have depression or have or ever had suicidal thoughts 
have a psychiatric disorder 
currently take medicinal products that affect your brain such as treatments for anxiety or 
depression 
have regularly taken drugs (except as medicines) or been addicted to drugs or alcohol  
have liver problems: depending on their severity, QUVIVIQ may not be recommended, or a 
lower dose might be required. 
have breathing difficulties (such as severe obstructive sleep apnoea or severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease) 
have a history of falling and are older than 65 (because there is generally a higher risk of falling 
in patients > 65). 
Your doctor may want to monitor how the medicine affects you. 
Tell your doctor if you get any of the following side effects while taking QUVIVIQ: 
- 
- 
sleep paralysis: a temporary inability to move or talk for up to several minutes upon awakening 
or falling asleep 
hallucinations: seeing or hearing vivid or disturbing things that are not real upon awakening or 
falling asleep 
If you have depression and you experience a worsening or have thoughts of harming yourself, call 
your doctor straight away. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because QUVIVIQ has not 
been tested in this age group. 
Other medicines and QUVIVIQ 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
because:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
certain antibiotics (erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, rifampicin), immuno-
suppressants (cyclosporine), antifungal agents (itraconazole), cancer treatments (ceritinib), or 
HIV treatments (ritonavir, efavirenz) can increase or decrease the level of QUVIVIQ in the 
blood. Some of these medicines may be contra-indicated with QUVIVIQ (see section “Do not 
take QUVIVIQ”). Your doctor will advise you on this. 
certain medicines that work in your brain (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam) could interact with 
QUVIVIQ. Your doctor will advise you on this. 
certain medicines to treat blood coagulation disorder such as dabigatran could interact with 
QUVIVIQ, which would require some precaution. Your doctor will advise you on this. 
certain medicines to treat cardiac impairment such as digoxin could interact with QUVIVIQ, 
which would require some precaution. Your doctor will advise you on this. 
QUVIVIQ with food, drink and alcohol 
Drinking alcohol with QUVIVIQ can increase the risk of impaired balance and coordination. 
Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice in the evening as they may increase the level of QUVIVIQ in the 
blood. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
It is not known if QUVIVIQ can harm your unborn baby. 
It is not known if QUVIVIQ passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to 
feed your baby during treatment with QUVIVIQ. 
It is not known if QUVIVIQ affects human fertility. 
Driving and using machines 
A period of approximately 9 hours is recommended between taking QUVIVIQ and driving or using 
machines. Be cautious about driving or using machines in the morning after taking QUVIVIQ. Do not 
engage in potentially hazardous activities if you are not sure you are fully alert, especially in the first 
few days of treatment.  
QUVIVIQ contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to take QUVIVIQ 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
How much QUVIVIQ to take 
Your doctor will advise you on the dose of QUVIVIQ to take.  
The recommended dose is one 50-mg tablet of QUVIVIQ per night.  
If you have liver problems or take certain other medicines, your doctor may prescribe you a lower 
dose of one 25-mg tablet of QUVIVIQ per night. 
The treatment duration should be as short as possible. The appropriateness of continued treatment will 
be assessed within 3 months by your doctor and periodically thereafter.  
-

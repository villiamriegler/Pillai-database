The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
SP1005  study  (an  open-label,  long-term  follow-up  study  to  determine  the  safety,  tolerability, 
and  efficacy  of  rotigotine  transdermal  system  as  monotherapy  in  adolescents  with  Restless  Legs 
Syndrome) 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
SP1005  study  (an  open-label,  long-term  follow-up  study  to  determine  the  safety,  tolerability,  and 
efficacy of rotigotine transdermal system as monotherapy in adolescents with Restless Legs Syndrome) 
Description 
SP1005 was a Phase 2A, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, optimal dose, long-term follow-up study 
of monotherapy administration of the rotigotine transdermal patch. Subjects entering this study from a 
previous rotigotine pharmacokinetic (PK) study in adolescents with RLS (SP1004; filed to Article 46 at 
Preliminary assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with 
article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

the  end  of  2014)  must  have  tolerated  the  first  dose  level  of  rotigotine  in  that  study  without  meeting 
any of the withdrawal criteria. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of  rotigotine 
treatment in adolescents with idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). 
The  secondary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  long-term  efficacy  of  rotigotine  treatment  in 
adolescents with idiopathic RLS. 
Study design 
This  was  a  Phase  2A,  multicenter,  open-label,  single-arm,  optimal  dose,  long-term  follow-up  (LTFU) 
study of monotherapy administration of the rotigotine transdermal patch. Subjects entering this study 
from a previous rotigotine study in adolescents with RLS (SP1004) must have tolerated the first dose 
level of rotigotine in that study without meeting the withdrawal criteria. 
The  study  began  with  a  Titration  Period  of  up  to  4  weeks  with  the  aim  of  achieving  the  individually 
optimized dosage (with a maximum dose of 3mg/24h at Visit 4 of SP1005). During the Titration Period, 
the investigator should have determined whether the subject had reached his/her optimal dose prior to 
completing the scheduled assessments for that visit. Once a subject had reached his/her optimal dose, 
he/she should have proceeded to the Maintenance Period (Visit 5) and completed those assessments. 
The  Titration  Period  was  followed  by  a  Maintenance  Period  of  up  to  2  years.  Dose  adjustment  of 
rotigotine was allowed at any time during the Maintenance Period, based on clinical judgment up to a 
maximum  dose  of  3mg/24h.  At  the  End  of  the  Maintenance  Period  (EOM),  subjects  entered  a  Taper 
Period lasting up to 6 days (de-escalation of study medication), followed by a 30-day Safety Follow-up 
(SFU) Period. 
Study population /Sample size 
No  formal  sample  size  calculation  was  performed  for  this  study.  A  maximum  of  24  subjects  from 
SP1004  were  expected  to  participate  in  SP1005,  based  on  the  assumption  that  all  planned  subjects 
from SP1004 rolled over into SP1005. 
A total of 14 subjects from SP1004 were enrolled during the study, and 14 subjects were treated with 
study medication. Of these 14 subjects, 1 subject completed the study. 
Treatments 
The  rotigotine  transdermal  patch  was  supplied  by  the  UCB  Clinical  Trial  Supply  group  and  was 
administered  in  the  following  doses  and  sizes:  0.2mg/24h  (1cm2),  0.5mg/24h  (2.5cm2),  1mg/24h 
(5cm2), 2mg/24h (10cm2), and 3mg/24h (15cm2). 
The  study  began  with  a  Titration  Period  of  up  to  4  weeks  with  the  aim  of  achieving  the  individually 
optimized dosage  (with  a maximum  dose  of  3mg/24h  at  Visit 4  of  SP1005).  The  Titration  Period  was 
followed by a Maintenance Period of up to 2 years. At the EOM, subjects entered a Taper Period of up 
to 6 days, followed by a 30-day SFU Period. 
The mean number of days of study medication exposure for the Safety Set (SS) was 245.2 days.

Statistical Methods 
All statistical analyses were considered exploratory in nature. A complete set of data listings containing 
all  documented  data  and  all  calculated  data  (eg,  change  from  Baseline)  were  generated  and  were 
sorted  by  site,  subject  number,  and  visit  (where  applicable).  Descriptive  statistics  were  displayed  to 
provide  an  overview  of  the  safety,  efficacy,  and  PK  results.  For  categorical  parameters,  the  number 
and percentages of subjects in each category were presented overall for all subjects, or by dose level 
or modal dose, as appropriate. The denominator for percentages was based on the number of subjects 
appropriate for the purpose of the analysis. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics included 
number of subjects (n), arithmetic mean, standard  deviation (SD), median,  minimum, and maximum 
and were presented by treatment. Summary statistics were presented overall and by modal dose. 
Baseline for IRLS, RLS-6, CGI Items 1 through 4, safety variables (eg, laboratory data, ECG findings, 
vital  signs),  and  other  variables  (ADHD  Rating  Scale-IV,  Cleveland  Adolescent  Sleepiness 
Questionnaire,  patch  adhesiveness)  was  defined  as  the  last  nonmissing  scheduled  or  unscheduled 
assessment prior to first rotigotine administration in SP1004, unless otherwise noted for a specific type 
of  data.  Baseline  for  PLMs  and  for  sleep  duration  was  defined  as  the  average  of  the  repeated 
assessments before first rotigotine administration in SP1004.

All enrolled subjects who signed informed consent for SP1005 were included in the Enrolled Set (ES). 
All  safety  and  PK  analyses  were  performed  on  the  SS,  which  included  all  subjects  in  the  ES  who 
received at least 1 dose of study medication. All efficacy analyses were performed on the Full Analysis 
Set  (FAS),  which  included  all  subjects  in  the  SS  who  had  at  least  1  post-Baseline  efficacy 
measurement. 
The  duration  of  rotigotine  exposure  overall  for  the  entire  study,  during  the  Titration  Period, 
Maintenance Period, and Taper Period, and by visit was summarized with quantitative statistics for the 
SS. 
The safety of rotigotine was the primary endpoint in this study and  was  assessed via AEs, laboratory 
data, ECG parameters, vital signs, neurological examination findings, skin tolerability, hormone status, 
menstrual and sexual function, mMIDI results, body weight, height, BMI, Tanner Stage, and CGI Item 
4.

Nine subjects (64.3%) in the SS reported concomitant medication use. The most common concomitant 
medications  by  level  1  anatomical  therapeutic  chemical  class  were  nervous  system  medications 
(57.1%)  and  anti-infectives  for  systemic  use,  musculoskeletal  system  medications,  and  respiratory 
system medications (28.6% each). 
The  mean  time  since  the  first  RLS  symptoms  for  subjects  in  the  SS  was  4.9  years  (range:  0  to  13 
years), and the mean time since RLS diagnosis was 0.9 years (range: 0 to 3 years). 
A summary of the descriptive statistics for compliance rate is presented in Table below: 
Descriptive statistics for compliance rate (SS) 
Mean  compliance  across  visits  was  high  (range:  88.50%  to  107.80%).  Mean  compliance  during  the

Efficacy results 
Change from Baseline in periodic limb movements 
The  mean  PLMI  at  Baseline  was  generally  similar  across  all  modal  dose  categories  (mean  range: 
5.760/h  to  16.585/h)  (Table  12.1).  The  mean  PLMI  ratios  relative  to  Baseline  generally  decreased 
across  visits  for  all  modal  dose  categories  (mean  range  from  Month  7  to  EOM/EDV:  0.150/h  to 
0.840/h).

Change from Baseline in Restless Legs Syndrome-6 Rating Scales 
In general, the mean RLS-6 scores for individual items at Baseline were similar among the modal dose 
categories.  For  Items  1  through  6,  mean  reductions  (indicating  improvement)  from  Baseline  were 
observed for all modal dose categories at all visits through the EOM/EDV, with the exception of Items 
3, 4, and 5 (range: 0.0 to 1.0 points) for the rotigotine 0.5mg/24h modal dose category. 
The mean change from Baseline value across all 6 items for all modal dose categories had the following 
ranges: -9.0 to 1.0 points.

Sleep duration 
The derived sleep duration at Baseline was similar for all modal dose categories (mean range: 7.171h 
to  7.390h).  Mean  changes  from  Baseline  in  derived  sleep  duration  were  small  at  all  visits  for  the 
rotigotine  2mg/24h  and  3mg/24h  modal  dose  categories  (mean  range  across  visits:  -1.770h  to 
0.650h; no change from Baseline data exist for the rotigotine 0.5mg/24h modal dose category). 
Pharmacokinetic results 
As  expected,  mean  plasma  concentrations  of  unconjugated  rotigotine  generally  increased  in  Mean 
plasma  concentrations  of  unconjugated  rotigotine  normalized  by  body  weight  generally  increased  in 
parallel  with  dose  for  rotigotine  0.5mg/24h  through  3mg/24hparallel  with  dose  for  rotigotine 
0.5mg/24h through 3mg/24h. 
Safety results 
The mean number of days of study medication exposure for the SS was 245.2 days. Most subjects had 
a  duration  of  exposure  of  ˃4  to  ≤26  weeks  (4  subjects  [28.6%])  or  ˃26  to  ≤52  weeks  (6  subjects 
[42.9%]). Two subjects (14.3%) had a duration of exposure of ≤4 weeks, and 1 subject (7.1%) had a

One subject had a clinical chemistry-related TEAE during the study: Subject, a 17-year-old white male, 
experienced a TEAE of blood sodium increased 166 days after the first dose of study medication; the 
subject was taking rotigotine 1mg/24h at TEAE onset. The TEAE was mild in intensity, not considered 
to be drug related, and resolved within 6 days. On the day of the TEAE onset (EOM/EDV), the subject 
had  a  high  sodium  value  of  167mmol/L  (normal  range:  132  to  147mmol/L).  At  an  unscheduled 
EOM/EDV.2, the subject had a normal sodium value of 145mmol/L. The subject also had a high sodium 
value at Month 1, Month 3, and the SFU Visit, which ranged from 149 to 155mmol/L. 
One  subject  had  a  urinalysis-related  TEAE  during  the  study.  Subject,  a  16-year-old  white  female, 
experienced  a  TEAE  of  hematuria  23  day  after  removal  of  the  last  rotigotine  patch.  The  TEAE  was 
moderate in intensity, not considered to be drug related, and resolved within 9 days (Listing 6.2). On 
the  day  of  TEAE  onset  (SFU  Visit),  the  subject  had  occult  blood  results  of  3+  (first  result)  and  trace 
(second result), an amorphous crystal result of 4+, a bacteria result of 4+, and specimen appearance 
results  of  clear  (first  result)  and  turbid  (second  result).  All  other  results  for  this  subject  were  not 
clinically relevant (ie, findings of normal, negative, or trace) during the study. 
Two  subjects  reported  ECG-related  TEAEs  during  the  study.  Subject,  a  17-year-old  white  female, 
experienced  a  TEAE  of  ECG  QTc  prolonged  57  days  after  the  first  dose  of  study  medication  (ie,  at 
Month  2);  the  subject  was  taking  rotigotine  3mg/24h  at  the  TEAE  onset  (Listing  6.2).  The  TEAE  was 
mild  in  intensity,  not  considered  to  be  drug  related,  and  resolved  within  28  days.  The  details  of  this 
subject’s TEAE are included in the medical monitor review forms, located in the study files, based on 
the discussions between the medical monitor and site personnel. Subject, a 14-year-old white female, 
experienced a TEAE of sinus tachycardia 523 days after the first dose of study medication; the subject 
was  taking  rotigotine  2mg/24h  at  the  TEAE  onset  (Listing  6.2).  The  TEAE  was  moderate  in  intensity, 
considered to be drug-related, and resolved within 1 day. The onset of the TEAE did not correspond to 
ECG results collected at a specified visit. The subject’s heart rate was 78bpm at Baseline and ranged 
from 63 to 93bpm during the study. 
Vital sign measurements 
Five  subjects  had  decreases  in  BP  that  was  determined  to  be  evidence  of  orthostatic  hypotension  by 
the investigator (ie, drop in SBP of ≥20mmHg and/or drop in DBP of ≥10mmHg at 1 and/or 3 minutes 
upon  standing  after  remaining  supine  for  5  minutes).  These  events  were  considered  to  be 
asymptomatic  orthostatic  hypotension  that  was  not  clinically  relevant  for  4  of  these  subjects.  One 
subject (Subject) experienced symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at Month 1 that was captured as a 
TEAE. 
No clinically relevant changes from Baseline in BMI were observed for all subjects during the study. No 
weight-related TEAEs were reported during the study. 
Skin tolerability 
Most subjects (range: 50% to 100%) at each modal dose had no evidence of dermal irritation at the 
study  medication  application  site  at  any  visit.  Five  subjects  (Subject,  Subject,  Subject,  Subject,  and 
Subject)  had  minimal  erythema  at  any  visit  during  the  study.  No  subjects  had  evidence  of  definite 
erythema, any edema or  papules, vesicular eruption, or strong reactions spreading beyond the study 
medication application site. 
The  majority  of  subjects  (range:  75.0%  to  100%)  at  each  modal  dose  had  no  other  effects  at  the 
study medication application site at any  visit; 1 subject in the rotigotine 3mg/24h group had a  slight 
glazed  appearance  at  the  study  medication  application  site  at  Month  1,  Month  7,  and  Month  10.  No 
subjects  had  marked  glazing,  glazing  with  peeling  and  cracking,  glazing  with  fissures,  film  of  dried

serious exudate covering all or part of the study medication application site, or small petechial erosions 
and/or scabs. 
Subject,  a  17-year-old  Black  or  African  American  female,  experienced  a  TEAE  of  application  site 
pruritus 111 days after the first dose of study medication; the subject was taking rotigotine 3mg/24h 
at the TEAE onset. The TEAE was mild in intensity, considered to be drug related, and resolved within 
103 days. This TEAE was not associated with any evidence of dermal response or other effects at any 
visit. 
Tanner Stage assessment and menstrual/sexual function 
The majority of subjects (range: 80.0% to 100%) were Tanner Stage 5 at each modal dose during the 
study  (Table  11.4).  One  subject  in  the  rotigotine  3mg/24h  group  was  Tanner  Stage  3  at  all  visits, 
including Baseline, and 1 subject in the rotigotine 3mg/24h group was Tanner Stage 4 at Baseline and 
Month 1. No subjects were Tanner Stage 1 or 2 at any time point. 
Three  subjects  reported  changes  in  menstrual  functioning  as  follows:  Subject  reported  changes  at 
Months 4, 7, and 10; Subject reported changes at the EOM/EDV; and Subject reported changes at the 
SFU Visit. 
Subject reported a TEAE of dysmenorrhea 61 days after the first dose of study medication (ie, prior to 
Month 3); this TEAE was mild in intensity, was not considered to be drug related, and resolved within 
231 days. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This  was  a  Phase  2A,  multicenter,  open-label,  single-arm,  optimal  dose,  LTFU  study  of  monotherapy 
administration  of  the  rotigotine  transdermal  patch  in  adolescents  with  RLS.  Subjects  entering  this 
study from a previous rotigotine study in adolescents with RLS (SP1004) must have tolerated the first 
dose level of rotigotine in that study without meeting the withdrawal criteria. The primary objective of 
this  study  was  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of  rotigotine  treatment  in  adolescents 
with  idiopathic  RLS.  The  secondary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  long-term  efficacy  of 
rotigotine treatment. 
Fourteen subjects were enrolled and treated with study medication. The mean number of days of study 
medication exposure for treated subjects was 245.2 days. Of the 14 subjects, 1 subject completed the 
study.  For  the  13  subjects  who  discontinued  the  study,  the  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation 
from the study was consent withdrawn. Of the 14 enrolled subjects, 11 of these subjects attained an 
optimal dose of the rotigotine transdermal system of 3mg/24h. The subject demographics and Baseline 
characteristics of disease severity were representative of adolescent patients with idiopathic RLS who 
require pharmacologic treatment. The majority of subjects were Tanner Stage 5 at Baseline, indicating 
that the development of their external sex characteristics was that of an adult. 
The  results  of  this  study  demonstrated  that  the  rotigotine  transdermal  system  was  well  tolerated  at 
doses up to 3mg/24h in adolescent subjects with idiopathic RLS. No safety issues were identified, and 
there  were  no  deaths  or  serious  TEAEs.  The  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  were  nausea,  vomiting, 
and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection.  The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  TEAEs  by  PT  were 
nausea and vomiting and were consistent with the stimulation of dopamine receptors and the use of a 
transdermal  patch.  One  subject  in  each  dose  group  reported  discontinuations  due  to  TEAEs  (nausea, 
vomiting,  and  drug  screen  positive).  One  posttreatment  SAE  of  abortion  spontaneous  was  reported; 
this SAE was severe in intensity, not considered to be drug related, and resolved within 1 day.

No consistent or clinically relevant changes from Baseline in hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, 
or  hormone  status  (for  males  or  females)  values  across  modal  dose  categories  were  observed.  One 
subject had a TEAE of blood sodium increased, which was mild in intensity, and 1 subject had a TEAE 
of hematuria, which was moderate in intensity; both TEAEs were not considered to be drug related and 
resolved. 
No consistent or clinically relevant changes in 12-lead ECG results or vital signs were observed for all 
subjects  during  the  study.  The  TEAEs  of  ECG  QTc  prolonged  and  palpitations  were  reported  by  1 
subject each; both TEAEs were mild in intensity, not considered to be drug related, and resolved. One 
subject had a TEAE of sinus tachycardia and 1 subject had TEAEs of syncope, orthostatic hypotension, 
and  presyncope,  all  of  which  were  moderate  in  intensity  and  resolved;  only  the  TEAE  of  sinus 
tachycardia was considered to be drug related. 
The majority of subjects had no evidence of dermal  irritation at the study medication application site 
and  reported  no  side  effects  during  the  study  on  CGI  Item  4.  No  subjects  had  a  positive  response, 
which would indicate the  presence of compulsive behaviors, at  Baseline or at the end of the  study in 
any of the mMIDI modules. 
Improvements at each modal dose were generally observed for most efficacy parameters including the 
IRLS, CGI Items 1 through 3, and select individual items of the RLS-6, indicating improvements in RLS 
symptoms and sleep. Mean reductions from Baseline in the ADHD Rating Scale-IV score and Cleveland 
Adolescent Sleepiness Questionnaire score were generally observed at all visits through the EOM/EDV 
for  all  modal  dose  categories,  indicating  improvements  in  attention  and  a  lessening  of  sleepiness, 
respectively, in these subjects. Small decreases in derived sleep duration were observed for all modal 
dose categories. The majority of subjects had ≥75% patch adhesiveness for each modal dose category, 
and patch detachment was reported by no more than 1 subject at any visit. 
Mean  plasma  concentrations  of  unconjugated  rotigotine  generally  increased  in  parallel  with  dose  for 
rotigotine  0.5mg/24h  through  3mg/24h  and  were  in  the  range  of  results  from  earlier  studies  both  in 
adolescents and adults. 
The  results  of  this  study  suggest  that  the  rotigotine  transdermal  system  is  safe  and  effective  in 
adolescent subjects (14 to 17 years of age at Baseline) with idiopathic RLS. However, due to the small 
number  of  subjects,  and  the  open-label  design,  the  findings  of  this  study  should  be  interpreted  with 
caution. 
Safety 
From  the  results  obtained,  the  rotigotine  transdermal  system  was  well  tolerated  at  doses  up  to  and 
including 3mg/24h in adolescent subjects (14 to <18 years of age) with idiopathic RLS: 
•  Overall, the majority of TEAEs were consistent with the stimulation of dopamine receptors and 
the use of a transdermal patch. 
•  Overall,  10  subjects  (71.4%)  reported  TEAEs  and  of  these,  1,  2,  and  7  subjects  were  in  the 
rotigotine  0.5mg/24h,  2mg/24h,  and  3mg/24h  groups,  respectively.  The  most  frequently 
reported  TEAEs  by  PT  overall  were  nausea  (4  subjects  [28.6%]),  vomiting  (3  subjects 
[21.4%])  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (3  subjects  [21.4%]).  No  other  TEAEs  were 
reported by >2 subjects. 
•  One  subject  each  in  the  rotigotine  0.5mg/24h  and  2mg/24h  groups,  and  3  subjects  in  the 
rotigotine  3mg/24h  group  reported  drug-related  TEAEs  (per  the  investigator’s  assessment). 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  TEAEs  by  PT  were  nausea  (21.4%)  and  vomiting 
(14.3%). No other drug-related TEAEs were reported by >1 subject.

•  All  of  the  TEAEs  in  this  study  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity.  One  posttreatment  SAE 
(abortion spontaneous) was severe in intensity. 
•  No deaths or serious TEAEs were reported during the study. 
•  One subject in each dose group reported discontinuations due to TEAEs (nausea, vomiting, and 
drug  screen  positive),  which  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  considered  to  be  drug 
related. 
• 
Eight subjects reported TEAEs that led to intervention. With the exception of 1 TEAE of nausea 
that led to withdrawal of study medication, none of the TEAEs leading to an intervention led to 
a  change  in  the  dose  of  the  study  medication.  The  majority  of  TEAEs  resulted  in  the  subject 
being administered a concomitant medication and were not drug related.   I n   g e n e r a l,   m e a n  
values  for  hematology,  clinical  chemistry,  and  hormone  status  (for  males  and  females) 
parameters  were  within  the  normal  ranges  for  subjects  in  all  modal  dose  categories.  Overall, 
no  notable  differences  in  hematology,  clinical  chemistry,  or  hormone  status  (for  males  or 
females) values across modal dose categories and no consistent or clinically relevant changes 
from  Baseline  were  observed.  No  clinically  relevant  changes  in  urinalysis  parameters  were 
observed for any modal dose during the study. 
•  One subject had a TEAE of blood sodium increased, which was mild in intensity, and 1 subject 
had a TEAE of hematuria, which was moderate in intensity. Both TEAEs were not considered to 
be  drug  related  and  resolved.  No  other  laboratory-related  TEAEs  were  reported  during  the 
study. 
•  No clinically relevant changes in 12-lead ECG results, vital signs, or BMI were observed for all 
subjects  during  the  study.  None  of  the  abnormal  vital  signs  or  12-lead  ECG  results  was 
considered  to  be  clinically  relevant  by  the  investigator.  No  clinically  relevant  physical 
abnormalities were reported during the study. 
• 
The TEAEs of ECG QTc prolonged and palpitations were reported by 1 subject each; both TEAEs 
were  mild  in  intensity,  not  considered  to  be  drug  related,  and  resolved.  One  subject  had  a 
TEAE  of  sinus  tachycardia  and  1  subject  had  TEAEs  of  syncope,  orthostatic  hypotension,  and 
presyncope,  all  of  which  were  moderate  in  intensity  and  resolved;  only  the  TEAE  of  sinus 
tachycardia was considered to be drug related. 
•  Most subjects (range: 50% to 100%) at each modal dose had no evidence of dermal irritation 
at the study medication application site at any visit. Five subjects had minimal erythema at any 
visit during the study. The majority of subjects (range: 75.0% to 100%) at  each modal dose 
had  no  other  effects  at  the  study  medication  application  site  at  any  visit;  1  subject  in  the 
rotigotine  3mg/24h  group  had  a  slight  glazed  appearance  at  the  study  medication  application 
site. One subject had a mild, drug-related TEAE of application site pruritus that resolved. 
•  No subjects had positive responses in any of the mMIDI modules during the  study, indicating 
that  no  subjects  reported  compulsive  behaviors.  As  a  result,  no  subjects  had  a  change  from 
Baseline in their mMIDI response during the study. 
• 
The  majority  of  subjects  were  Tanner  Stage  5  at  each  modal  dose  (range:  80.0%  to  100%) 
during the study, indicating that the development of their external sex characteristics was that 
of  an  adult.  Three  subjects  reported  changes  in  menstrual  functioning;  1  of  these  subjects 
reported  a  TEAE  of  dysmenorrhea  that  was  mild  in  intensity,  was  not  considered  to  be  drug 
related, and resolved. No subjects reported changes in sexual function during the study.

• 
The majority of subjects (range: 70.0% to 100%) reported no side effects at all time points on 
CGI Item 4. Three subjects reported side effects that significantly interfered with the subjects’ 
functioning or that outweighed therapeutic efficacy across visits. Moderate, drug-related TEAEs 
of sudden onset of sleep, nausea, and nausea and vomiting were reported by 1 subject each; 
all of these TEAEs resolved. 
•  One  subject  (100%)  at  EOM  and  10  subjects  (76.9%)  at  EOM/EDV  reported  their  overall 
tolerability  of  the  treatment  as  very  good.  Overall  tolerability  of  treatment  was  reported  as 
good, neither good nor bad, or bad at EOM/EDV by 1 subject (7.7%) each. 
•  No subjects reported that they had suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior during the study. 
Efficacy 
Due  to  the  small  number  of  subjects,  as  well  as  the  open-label  design  of  the  study,  the  efficacy 
observations  of  this  study  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  The  efficacy  observations  were  as 
follows: 
• 
• 
• 
The  mean  PLMI  at  Baseline  was  generally  similar  across  all  modal  dose  categories  (mean 
range:  5.760/h  to  16.585/h).  The  mean  PLMI  ratios  relative  to  Baseline  generally  decreased 
across visits for all modal dose categories (mean range from Month 7 to EOM/EDV: 0.150/h to 
0.840/h). 
The  severity  of  RLS  at  Baseline  was  similar  across  all  modal  dose  categories  based  on  the 
mean  IRLS  sum  scores  (mean  range:  23.5  to  27.5  points).  Mean  reductions  in  the  IRLS  sum 
score  were  observed  across  visits  for  all  modal  dose  categories  (mean  range  at  EOM/EDV:  -
19.5 to -12.5 points), indicating a lower severity of RLS. 
The  mean  CGI  Item  1  score  at  Baseline  was  similar  across  all  modal  dose  categories  (mean 
range: 4.0 to 5.0 points). The mean change from Baseline in CGI Item 1 score was generally 
similar  across  visits  for  all  modal  dose  categories  (mean  range  at  EOM/EDV:  -2.5  to  -2.0 
points). 
•  Most  subjects  reported  improvements  in  their  condition  (CGI  Item  2)  and  very  good 
therapeutic efficacy of study medication (CGI Item 3) during the study. 
• 
• 
In  general,  mean  reductions  (indicating  improvement)  from  Baseline  were  observed  for  RLS 
Items  1  through  6,  ADHD  Rating  Scale-IV  score,  and  Cleveland  Adolescent  Sleepiness 
Questionnaire score for all modal dose categories at all visits through the EOM/EDV. 
The derived sleep duration at Baseline was similar for all modal dose categories (mean range: 
7.171h to 7.390h). Mean changes from Baseline in derived sleep duration were small visits: -
1.770h  to  0.650h;  no  change  from  Baseline  data  exist  for  the  rotigotine  0.5  mg/24h  modal 
dose category). 
•  Most subjects had ≥75% patch adhesiveness for each modal dose category; patch detachment 
was  reported  by  no  more  than  1  subject  at  any  visit.  In  addition,  the  percentage  of  subjects 
with  ≥90%  patch  adhesiveness  at  the  EOM/EDV  was  75.0%  (range:  50.0%  to  100%  across 
modal dose categories). 
Conclusions 
• 
The  results  of  this  study  showed  that  the  rotigotine  transdermal  system  was  rather  well 
tolerated at doses up to and including 3mg/24h in adolescent subjects with idiopathic RLS. No 
safety issues were identified, and there were no deaths or serious TEAEs. All of the TEAEs were

mild  or  moderate  in  intensity;  1  severe  posttreatment  SAE  that  was  not  drug  related  (as  per 
the investigator’s assessment) was reported. 
•  Overall, the majority of TEAEs were consistent with the stimulation of dopamine receptors and 
the  use  of  a  transdermal  patch.  The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  overall  were  nausea, 
vomiting, and upper respiratory tract infection, and the most frequently reported drug-related 
TEAEs were nausea and vomiting. 
• 
Improvements  at  each  modal  dose  category  were  observed  in  most  efficacy  parameters, 
including the IRLS, CGI Items 1 through 3, and select individual items of the RLS-6, indicating 
improvements in RLS symptoms and sleep. 
•  Mean  plasma  concentrations  of  unconjugated  rotigotine  were  within  expected  values  and 
generally increased in parallel with dose for rotigotine 0.5mg/24h to 3mg/24h. 
•  Based  on  the  results  of  this  long-term  extension  study,  the  rotigotine  transdermal  system 
appears  to  be  safe  and  effective  for  adolescent  subjects  (14  to  17  years  of  age  at  Baseline) 
with idiopathic RLS. However, due to the small number of subjects, and the open-label design, 
the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. 
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation  
Paediatric RLS is a rare disorder and may be self limited if related to a transient comorbidity such as 
iron deficiency. Therefore it is understood the low number of subjects being enrolled, and possibly the 
fact  that  most  have  withdrawn  the  consent  to  remain  in  study,  as  many  might  have  improved 
spontaneously,  without  the  need  to  be  kept  under  treatment.  Being  an  open  label  study,  the  true 
magnitude of efficacy cannot be ascertained. As such, we do not agree with MAH when they state that 
the drug appears to be efficacious in paediatric RLS, because we simply do not now. 
Regarding safety, based on the results of SP1005 (ie, the long-term extension study to SP1004), the 
rotigotine  transdermal  system  appears  to  be  safe  for  adolescent  subjects  (14  to  17  years  of  age  at 
Baseline) with idiopathic RLS when administered at doses up to and including 3mg/24h. No new safety 
concerns  were  identified  in  this  study.  However,  due  to  the  small  number  of  subjects  and  the  open-
label design, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. 
No changes to the approved EU Product Information for Neupro are proposed following the completion 
of  this  study.  UCB  is  submitting  this  study  in  accordance  with  Article 46 of  the  Paediatric  Regulation. 
The information is too scarce to deserve a listing in section 5.1 of SmPC.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH is submitting a Marketing Authorisation Extension Application for the addition of a new 
strength (245 mg/3.5 mL; 70 mg/ mL) and route of administration (subcutaneous use) for Ultomiris 
(ravulizumab) for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) or 
atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). 
The following indications for the subcutaneous formulation were initially proposed: 
Ultomiris subcutaneous formulation (Ultomiris SC) is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with 
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH): 
• 
• 
in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity. 
in patients who are currently treated with eculizumab or with ravulizumab intravenous 
formulation (Ultomiris IV). 
Ultomiris SC is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome 
(aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or are currently treated with eculizumab or 
ravulizumab IV. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a very rare and life-threatening disease in which 
uncontrolled complement activation leads to systemic complications, principally through intravascular 
haemolysis and thrombophilia.  
The prevalence of PNH is estimated at 15.9 cases per million individuals in Europe and occurs more 
frequently in Asia than in western countries. The median age of PNH onset is the early to mid 30s; 
however, patients of all ages may develop the disease (Schrezenmeier, 2014; Socie, 1996). 
Patients with PNH are at risk of substantial morbidity and mortality. Before the availability of 
eculizumab, mortality in several cohorts of patients with PNH approached 35% at 5 years, with a 
median survival of 10 years after diagnosis (de Latour, 2008; Hillmen, 1995; Socie, 1996). Patients 
with PNH have a decreased quality of life (QoL), which may include the inability to support themselves 
and social isolation due to debilitating fatigue, chronic pain, poor physical function, shortness of 
breath, abdominal pain, erectile dysfunction, frequent therapeutic interventions and hospitalization 
(Weitz, 2012). 
Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS; ICD-10 classification: D58.8) is a rare, progressive, and 
life-threatening disorder characterized by haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal injury, 
and extra-renal complications (Muus, 2013; Noris, 2009; Sellier-Leclerc, 2007). aHUS prevalence in 
the age group of 20 years or younger was described ranging from 2.2 to 9.4 per million population, 
while the only study that reported prevalence in all ages showed a prevalence of 4.9 per million 
population (Yan, 2020). 
Most cases of aHUS are caused by uncontrolled complement activation due to genetic mutations in the 
alternative pathway of complement. More recently, mutations in the gene of coagulation system have 
also been identified in patients with aHUS. There is a dysregulation of the alternative pathway of 
Assessment report

Page 8/119 
 
 
 
complement, resulting in uncontrolled complement activation (Campistol, 2015; Noris, 2009; Zuber, 
2012; George 2014). This uncontrolled complement activation causes inflammation, endothelial 
activation and damage, and a prothrombotic/procoagulant state resulting in systemic thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA; Noris, 2009; Stahl, 2008; Karpman, 2006; Licht, 2009). Approximately 20% to 
48% of patients are reported to have signs and symptoms of damage to extra-renal organs at 
presentation, including elevated liver or pancreatic enzymes, pericarditis, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, 
seizures, altered consciousness, and focal neurologic deficits (Loirat, 2011; Brodsky, 2015; Fidan, 
2018; Fremeaux-Bacchi, 2013). In many cases, multiorgan dysfunction is associated with poor 
prognosis and necessitates critical care. It is classified as a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is caused by a somatic mutation of the 
phosphatidylinositol glycan A (PIG-A) gene, located in the X-chromosome, that leads to a lack of CD55 
and CD59 (Hill, 2013), which are key, naturally occurring terminal complement inhibitor proteins on 
cell surfaces. The absence of these complement inhibitor proteins on the cell surface results in 
continuous activation of the alternative complement pathway, chronic intravascular haemolysis and an 
increased propensity for clot formation (Borowitz, 2010; Wyrick-Glatzel, 2006). 
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a severe disorder that frequently has a genetic 
component and results from the overactivation of the alternative complement pathway (Raina R, 2019; 
Yoshida Y, 2019). The disease primarily affects kidney function and is characterized by hemolytic 
anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment (Noris M, 2005). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
PNH is a debilitating, and life-threatening disease in which uncontrolled terminal complement activation 
leads to systemic complications, principally through intravascular haemolysis and thrombophilia 
(Brodsky, 2014; Brodsky, 2015). Effective treatment of PNH requires immediate, complete, and 
sustained inhibition of terminal complement activity to block haemolysis and prevent thrombosis.  
Anaemia in PNH is often multifactorial and can result from a combination of haemolysis and bone 
marrow failure.   
Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia are common and reflect deficient haematopoiesis. Clinical 
haemoglobinuria is intermittent in most patients and never occurs in some, but haemosidenuria is 
usually present.  
Thromboembolic events are the leading cause of death in patients with PNH, and pulmonary 
hypertension and end-organ damage of vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys, brain, and intestines, 
are sequelae of thromboembolic events.  
aHUS is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal injury, and extra-renal 
complications (Muus, 2013; Noris, 2009; Sellier-Leclerc, 2007). The predominant underlying cause of 
aHUS is dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement, resulting in uncontrolled complement 
activation (Campistol, 2015; Noris, 2009; Zuber, 2012; George 2014). The main objective of effective 
treatment for aHUS with complement-targeted therapy is to provide immediate, complete, and 
sustained inhibition of terminal complement activity to treat and maintain patients with complement 
mediated TMA.

2.1.5.  Management 
The only approved drug for PNH, eculizumab (Soliris), was approved in 2007 in the EU. Eculizumab is a 
selective, humanized mAb that specifically targets C5 of the terminal complement cascade, inhibiting 
its cleavage during complement activation into C5a and C5b. Prior to the introduction of eculizumab 
(Soliris), the treatment of PNH was mainly supportive, aiming to control the clinical manifestations of 
the disease (management of haemolysis, anaemia, thrombophilia, and bone marrow failure). This 
supportive treatment included blood transfusion, administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, 
corticosteroids, or anabolic steroids, iron therapy, thrombosis prophylaxis, and thrombolytic therapy. 
Although the only available curative approach for PNH is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT), it is not recommended as upfront therapy in the eculizumab era given the 
risks of transplant-related morbidity and mortality. HSCT is a reasonable therapeutic option in patients 
who do not respond to therapy with eculizumab or those patients who have severe pancytopenia due 
to underlying BMF. The transplant paradigm pursued is often with reduced-intensity conditioning 
regimens, as myeloablation is not required to eradicate the PNH clone. In the current scenario, the use 
of HSCT may be revisited in the future as patients and healthcare providers weigh the cost-benefit 
ratio of HSCT versus a lifetime anti-C5 therapy. 
In the case of aHUS, the first approved treatment was eculizumab. When eculizumab was approved for 
aHUS in 2011, it was the first treatment for life-threatening complement-mediated TMA events. Prior 
to eculizumab, treatment of aHUS was limited to plasma therapy, though its clinical benefit had not 
been established. Since the approval of eculizumab, patients with aHUS are probably no longer treated 
with long-term plasma therapy, which can transiently maintain normal levels of hematologic measures 
while the underlying complement dysregulation and thrombotic microangiopathic processes likely 
persist (Loirat, 2010).  
Ravulizumab IV was approved in 2019 for PNH and in 2020 for aHUS, with a more convenient 
administration schedule.  
2.2.  About the product 
Ravulizumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody (mAb) IgG2/4K that specifically binds to 
the complement protein C5, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a (the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin) 
and C5b (the initiating subunit of the terminal complement complex [C5b-9]) and preventing the 
generation of the C5b-9. By binding specifically to C5, ravulizumab antagonizes terminal complement-
mediated inflammation, cell activation, and cell lysis while preserving the early components of 
complement pathway activation that are essential for opsonization of microorganisms and clearance of 
immune complexes (Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants; ATC code: 
L04AA43).This mechanism of action provides the therapeutic rationale for the use of ravulizumab to 
treat diseases in which activation of terminal complement plays an etiologic role. 
Ultomiris (ravulizumab, 10 mg/mL, for IV use) was initially approved for the treatment of PNH in the 
EU in July 2019 (EU/1/19/1371/001) and was subsequently approved on 25 June 2020 for the 
treatment of patients with a body weight of 10 kg or above with aHUS who are complement inhibitor 
treatment-naïve or have received eculizumab for at least 3 months and have evidence of response to 
eculizumab (EMEA/H/C/004954/II/0002). On 18 Nov 2020, a higher concentration (100 mg/mL) of 
ravulizumab was approved (EU/1/19/1371/002 and /003). 
A subcutaneous administration (ravulizumab SC, 70 mg/mL) has been developed to provide an 
alternative route of administration for adult patients with PNH or aHUS. Ravulizumab SC provides an 
alternative route of administration for adult patients with PNH and aHUS. It is a drug-device 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023

combination product (ravulizumab on-body delivery system, also referred to as ravulizumab SC) 
comprised of a prefilled cartridge containing 70 mg/mL ravulizumab (drug constituent) co-packaged 
with a single-use on-body injector (OBI, device constituent). In the context of combination product 
development and assessment, the primary mode of action of ravulizumab SC is the drug constituent, 
ravulizumab.  
In the EU, the drug product (ravulizumab) of the drug-device combination (ravulizumab SC) is 
regulated as a medicinal product per directive 2001/83/EC, and the administration device (OBI) of 
ravulizumab SC is regulated as a medical device in accordance with Article 1(9) of the Medical Device 
Regulation (MDR) EU 2017/745. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Ultomiris® (ravulizumab, 10 mg/mL, for IV use) was initially approved for the treatment of PNH in the 
EU on 02 Jul 2019 (EU/1/19/1371/001) and was subsequently approved for the aHUS indication on 25 
Jun 2020.  
On 18 Nov 2020, a formulation with a new strength of ravulizumab, 100 mg/mL, was approved 
(EU/1/19/1371/002 and /003). On 01 Sep 2021, Ultomiris was approved for the PNH indication in 
paediatric patients with a body weight of 10 kg or above [EU/1/19/1371 - EMEA/H/C/004954/II/0010]. 
This extension of the Marketing Authorisation concerns a new route of administration (subcutaneous 
injection) associated with a new strength (245 mg/3.5 mL (70 mg/ mL)) for Ultomiris. The clinical 
development program for ravulizumab SC is based on Study ALXN1210-PNH-303, a randomized, 
parallel group, open-label, multicenter, study to establish the non-inferior pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
ravulizumab SC as compared to ravulizumab IV in adult patients with PNH who are clinically stable and 
have been treated with eculizumab for at least 3 months prior to study entry.  
With regards to Ultomiris SC development, scientific advice was received on 14 Sep 2017 on the 
proposed clinical development and registration data package based on bridging the safety and efficacy 
data from Ultomiris IV on the basis of PK non-inferiority principles 
(EMEA/H/SA/3331/1/FU/2/2017/PA/III): 
•  The overall approach for development of the SC formulation of Ultomiris was endorsed by the 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and agreed that available nonclinical 
data were expected to be sufficient to support the authorization of the Ultomiris SC formulation.  
•  The proposed Phase 3 study design was considered adequate and acceptable. It was agreed that 
efficacy of the IV formulation of Ultomiris can be bridged to that of the SC formulation by 
establishing non-inferior PK exposure on the basis of trough concentration (Ctrough) between IV 
and SC formulations of Ultomiris, and that the non-inferior PK exposure as measured by Ctrough is 
an acceptable primary endpoint for the proposed registration trial. 
A second follow-up scientific advice was received on 26 Jul 2018 on the proposed device development 
aspects for the Ultomiris SC formulation in the treatment of adult patients with PNH, administered 
using an OBDS (EMEA/H/SA/3331/3/FU/1/2018/PA/I). The CHMP: 
• 
considered the proposed design of the human factor (HF) study acceptable to confirm the usability 
of the OBDS by simulating the in-use conditions.  
• 
confirmed the proposed drug-device stability plan and design verification testing (DVT) strategy 
were appropriate for the Phase 3 clinical study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023

the adequacy of the OBDS documentation will be decided at the time of the MAA assessment. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Alexion Europe SAS, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH), submitted a Marketing Authorisation 
Extension Application to implement the addition of a new strength (245 mg/3.5 mL (70 mg/ mL)) and 
route of administration (subcutaneous use, SC) for Ultomiris (ravulizumab) for the treatment of adult 
patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) or atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome 
(aHUS). 
Ultomiris On-Body Delivery System (OBDS) is comprised of a prefilled cartridge (PFC) containing 70 
mg/mL ravulizumab co-packaged with a single-use on-body injector (West SmartDose 3.5 Injector), 
hereafter referred to as “ravulizumab SC” (245 mg/OBDS). The 70 mg/mL strength is obtained by 
dilution of the ravulizumab 100 mg/mL active substance approved for intravenous (IV) administration 
with the same excipients (EU/1/19/1371/002 and /003). 
The finished product is presented as a sterile, preservative free, pH buffered, aqueous solution 
containing 70 mg/mL of ravulizumab as active substance. Other ingredients are: sodium phosphate, L-
arginine, sucrose and polysorbate 80. 
The product is available in a Crystal Zenith (CZ, cyclic-olefin polymer resin) cartridge barrel with a 
piston, Flurotec film coated septum, and polypropylene cap. The prefilled cartridge (PFC) is used with 
an on-body injector (OBI) for subcutaneous administration. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
This section is not applicable as the submission does not introduce any changes in the active substance 
part. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
Ravulizumab finished product is a solution for injection supplied as a sterile, preservative free, pH 
buffered, aqueous solution, in a single-dose prefilled cartridge with a single-use on-body injector 
(OBI). It contains ravulizumab at a concentration of 70 mg/mL (245 mg of ravulizumab/3.5 mL) in 
sodium phosphate, L-arginine, sucrose, and polysorbate 80, at pH 7.4.

The finished product container closure system consists of a Crystal Zenith (CZ, cyclic-olefin polymer 
resin) cartridge barrel with a piston, Flurotec film coated septum, and polypropylene cap. The prefilled 
cartridge (PFC) is used with an on-body injector (West SmartDose 3.5 Injector) to deliver the product 
for subcutaneous administration. The on-body injector is a compact, sterile, single-use, disposable, 
electro-mechanical (battery-powered, microprocessor-controlled) on-body injector with a 29-gauge 
integrated needle designed to be used together with a prefilled Crystal Zenith cartridge assembled with 
a piston and telescopic screw assembly. 
The on-body injector component must comply with the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The 
applicant committed to provide the EU certificate of conformity with the response to the Day 120 list of 
questions or, at the latest, before the CHMP opinion. The EU certificate of conformity for the device 
component is, however, not yet available. Nevertheless, the applicant has included in the dossier 
detailed information on the on-body delivery system that support its suitability for the intended use. In 
addition, the MAH has the responsibility to ensure that the co-packaged device is CE marked in 
accordance with the relevant EU legislation on medical devices prior to placing the product on the 
market.  
PFC 
The finished product composition is the same used for the active substance. No additional formulation 
steps are included. All excipients are compendial grade and the finished product composition has no 
overages. Ravulizumab is compatible with all the excipients in the formulation, as demonstrated 
previously for the already authorised presentations of Ultomiris. There are no physicochemical 
characteristics or biological properties of the ravulizumab active substance and excipients which 
influence the performance or manufacturability of the ravulizumab finished product. The formulation of 
the finished product has remained unchanged during clinical development. 
The finished product is manufactured by dilution of the 100 mg/mL active substance in formulation 
buffer to a target of 70 mg/mL followed by filtration with sterilizing grade filters. This sterile filtered 
solution is filled into a sterile container closure system, using a filling machine, and stoppered. All 
manufacturing steps are performed using aseptic techniques and qualified facilities. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) for ravulizumab and the definition of Critical Quality 
Attributes (CQA) were performed for the initial marketing authorisation of Ultomiris and remains the 
same for the SC 70 mg/mL strength. There were no major changes to the manufacturing process 
throughout clinical development. 
The finished product manufacturing process is the commercial finished product manufacturing process. 
There have been no changes to the process between pre-PPQ (Process Performance Qualification) and 
commercial manufacturing. No critical process parameters (CPPs) were identified for the finished 
product manufacturing process after performing a Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) exercise. 
The commercial manufacturing process was validated, as it is described in Section 3.2.P.3.5 Process 
Validation and/or Evaluation (3.5 mL/PFC). Comparability of the finished product pre- and post-PPQ 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 13/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
has been demonstrated through an analysis of release, extended characterisation and forced 
degradation studies (by temperature, deamidation and oxidation), using three pre-PPQ lots (the oldest, 
to add a level of additional robustness to the study) and three post-PPQ lots. Acceptance criteria were 
met for all assays and the profiles showed comparable peak profiles across all samples. 
The finished product is filled into a Crystal Zenith (cyclic-olefin polymer resin) cartridge stoppered with 
a FluroTec coated piston. The suitability of the container closure system (CCS) is demonstrated by 
appropriate studies, including stability, light-protection by secondary packaging, chemical resistance, 
CCS integrity (high voltage leak detection method and the helium leak test), closure suitability and 
extractable / leachable studies performed on the PFC. Only two compounds were detected in the 
extractable study. The safety margins for these compounds demonstrate negligible health hazard, 
which justifies the lack of need for further leachable testing. 
Ravulizumab SC is directly administered with the on-body delivery system from the PFC without 
dilution. Therefore, compatibility studies with other materials apart from the PFC are not required.   
Overall, the studies on Pharmaceutical Development performed by the applicant are considered 
adequate to guarantee the quality of the product, its microbiological attributes, and its compatibility for 
the intended use. 
OBDS 
Ravulizumab on-body delivery system (OBDS) consists of the prefilled cartridge (PFC) containing 
ravulizumab and an on-body injector (OBI). The essential performance requirements were confirmed 
by design verification activities, demonstrating that the use of ravulizumab with the OBI is safe and 
effective. 
The OBI is intended to be used to deliver through injection a fixed dose of ravulizumab from the PFC. 
The assembly process for OBDS is performed with no changes to the process between pre-PPQ and 
commercial manufacturing. The potential impact of each manufacturing step on product quality was 
assessed by a FMEA. No CPPs were identified during this evaluation. 
An extractable study was conducted on the fluid path assembly (Tygon tube, patient needle and 
cartridge needle) of the ravulizumab OBDS to evaluate any potential leachables during dosing. Four 
types of compounds were detected and quantitated. The estimated safety margins for these 
compounds demonstrate negligible health hazard, which justifies the lack of need for further leachable 
testing.  
The assembly process for ravulizumab OBDS includes the manual addition of a telescopic screw 
assembly (TSA) to the piston of the PFC. In order to demonstrate that this assembly process does not 
impact the integrity of the PFC components, supplemental study was successfully completed using the 
high voltage leak detection method (HVLD) on the PFC post-TSA assembly process on assembled 
ravulizumab OBDS. 
The design inputs for the device constituent and combination product were properly established. 
Design outputs (specifications) are used for evaluation of the conformance to the design. 
A design validation plan for ravulizumab OBDS was defined and executed successfully. Further, a 
design verification plan was performed to demonstrate that the design outputs meet the design input 
requirements. The acceptance criteria was based on a pre-defined confidence and reliability level, 
obtained by a risk-based approach. All Essential Performance Requirements (EPR) activities met their 
acceptance criteria. 
The biological safety of the OBDS was evaluated by a biological risk assessment, including a 
biocompatibility testing (patient contacting and drug contacting portions of the device), an extractable 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 14/119 
 
 
 
and leachables evaluation, and toxicological risk assessment. Results from these studies indicate that 
the likelihood of a toxic effect from the OBDS is negligible and can be considered safe for the intended 
use. 
A few design enhancements were made from the clinical to the commercial version of ravulizumab 
OBDS, including modifications to the hardware, software and user interface. A technical assessment 
was performed to compare the functional performance before and after design enhancements. The 
assessment included design inputs, design verification and design validation. Based on this analysis, 
the differences between clinical and commercial presentations would not impact device performance or 
drug exposure. 
A risk analysis was performed, focused on the drug-device interactions and the risk associated with 
ravulizumab OBDS. The risk analysis methods used included a preliminary hazard analysis and FMEAs, 
from the use, process and system design perspective. Identified risks were evaluated and were 
mitigated to acceptable levels by implementing risk control measures. The individual risks had been 
reduced as far as possible, concluding that the expected benefit of receiving the therapy outweighs 
each individual risk. 
Finally, the potential impact on patient satisfaction was quantified using a patient reported outcome 
tool, i.e.  Treatment Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire (TASQ) score, demonstrating a higher 
value for the proposed SC route of administration. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
PFC 
The ravulizumab 70 mg/mL finished product manufacturing site Patheon Italia S.p.A. (Monza) holds an 
appropriate MIA and GMP certificate of compliance. 
The ravulizumab 70 mg/mL finished product manufacturing process starts with the receipt of 
Ravulizumab 100 mg/mL active substance. The active substance is diluted to a target of 70 mg/mL 
using formulation buffer. Thereafter, the finished product is bioburden filtered prior to sterile filtration 
and aseptically filled into sterile cartridges, which are stoppered with rubber pistons. 
Equipment and components were properly prepared and every individual step was adequately 
validated/qualified for the intended use. 
As the finished product differs from the previously authorised presentation in strength (70 mg/mL) and 
container (PFC), a new risk assessment was performed to identify critical process parameters. The 
applicant confirmed that no CPP were identified for the finished product manufacturing process.  
All major equipment was properly validated/qualified, including E-beam tunnel, autoclaves, vapour 
hydrogen peroxide (VHP) decontamination, sterile filtration and filling manifolds. 
Sterility assurance validation was successfully completed performing three consecutive media fills 
simulations. During the media fills, the steps of a production fill are simulated under worst-case 
conditions. Re-qualification of the aseptic filling line is performed at least twice per year. Results 
demonstrate that aseptic conditions are maintained during the filling process. 
Process Performance Qualification was successfully demonstrated with PPQ runs covering the minimum 
and maximum batch size range. All acceptance criteria were met. 
Post PPQ minor changes were made. Verification studies to qualify these changes were successfully 
performed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 15/119 
 
 
 
Filters were correctly validated for the microbial retention capacity. Process hold time and shipping 
conditions were properly qualified. 
OBDS 
An appropriate MIA and GMP certificate of compliance have been provided for the site performing 
OBDS manufacture (assembly). The on-body injector (OBI) is manufactured at a contract device 
manufacturer, holding a GMP certificate of compliance. 
Tempered PFC is labelled and inspected, before the TSA is inserted into the piston of the PFC. Then, 
the labelled PFC-TSA assembly is placed into the blister pack containing the device (OBI), and later 
placed into a carton with the instruction for use (IFU) and package information leaflet (PIL). 
Adequate controls are in place to ensure the consistent, robust manufacture of the combination 
product. 
Process Performance Qualification was successfully demonstrated with PPQ runs. All acceptance criteria 
were met. Overall, the ravulizumab OBDS assembly process is capable of being executed in a 
consistent controlled manner. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
PFC 
The proposed specifications for the finished product (ravulizumab PFC) were derived from the 
specifications in place for the clinical studies, and it considers the authorised finished product 
formulated at 100 mg/mL. Release specifications are the same used for the authorised 100 mg/mL 
strength, adapted to the new strength for protein content, with the only exception of C5 binding. The 
applicant commits that the acceptance criterion will be reassessed when additional finished product 
release data are available and will be tightened if appropriate (Recommendation). This modification is 
considered acceptable. 
The analytical procedures used for pre-filled cartridges are mostly the same methods described for the 
control of the authorized ravulizumab active substance. The analytical methods used specifically for the 
finished product were appropriately validated for their intended use or were qualified in accordance 
with the referenced Ph. Eur. monographs. 
Characterisation of impurities is not required since there are no additional known process- or product-
related impurities specific to the ravulizumab finished product that are not present in the active 
substance. 
Release data from finished product product batches have been included in batch analysis. All batches 
comply with the specifications, demonstrating the consistency of the process and the uniformity of the 
finished product. 
OBDS 
The proposed specifications for the on-body delivery system were developed by systematic approach to 
define the essential performance requirement (EPR), based on the intended use, the identified use 
steps and the design input requirements. The approach used to set the specifications is considered 
appropriate.  
The acceptance criteria proposed for each EPR were properly justified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 16/119 
 
 
 
 
The analytical methods used to measure the EPR of the OBDS have been appropriately validated for 
their intended use. 
Release data from finished product batches have been presented. All batches comply with the 
specifications, demonstrating the consistency of the process and the uniformity of the OBDS. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
PFC 
The stability studies performed on Ravulizumab 3.5 mL/PFC are conducted according to ICH Q5C and 
ICH Q1E guidelines and are considered appropriate. Batches were placed in stability studies covering 
the standard cartridge storage (PFC) and the co-package with the OBDS. 
Forced degradation and photostability studies have demonstrated ravulizumab sensitivity to light and 
elevated temperature. Stability indicating attributes have been properly identified by the accelerated 
stability data. 
All available data from ravulizumab finished product stored at 2-8°C (long term storage conditions) 
meet acceptance criteria up to the latest time point available. Based on these data, the applicant 
proposes a shelf life of 24 months stored at 2-8°C protected from light. The shelf life could be 
extended after completion of stability studies, providing appropriate compliance with stability 
specifications. Any shelf life extension would be subject to a variation submission and assessment. 
The post-approval stability protocol and commitment are similar to those approved for ravulizumab 10 
and 100 mg/mL. 
OBDS 
The stability studies performed on the ravulizumab on-body delivery system (OBDS) are conducted 
according to ICH Q5C and ICH Q1E guidelines and include long-term (2-8°C) and accelerated (23-
27°C) storage. Ravulizumab OBDS shelf life has been determined to be 24 months when stored at 2-
8°C based on the constituent with the shortest shelf life (ravulizumab in PFC). 
A trending comparison was performed pre- and post-activation of ravulizumab OBDS. Results of these 
studies demonstrate comparability of the stability profiles over the 24-month shelf life.  
Ravulizumab OBDS Essential Performance Requirements (EPRs) are evaluated over the shelf life for 
ravulizumab OBDS, meeting acceptance criteria for the latest time point available. 
The post-approval stability protocol and commitment are similar to those for ravulizumab 3.5 mL/PFC 
(storage at 2-8ºC by 24 months) but applied to EPRs. 
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
The current submission is intended to implement the addition of a new strength (245 mg/3.5 mL (70 
mg/ mL)) and route of administration (subcutaneous use, SC). It also introduces a novel On-Body 
Delivery System (OBDS) for the SC administration, comprised of a prefilled cartridge (PFC) containing 
70 mg/mL ravulizumab co-packaged with a single-use on-body injector (West SmartDose 3.5 Injector). 
The rationale for these changes is to offer an alternative route of administration for adult patients with 
PNH or aHUS. 
The new strength is manufactured from the approved 100 mg/mL ravulizumab active substance and 
maintain the same formulation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 17/119 
 
 
 
Ravulizumab finished product manufacture includes dilution of the 100 mg/mL active substance in 
formulation buffer, followed by filtration with sterilizing grade filters. The manufacturing process was 
validated by a process performance qualification (PPQ) study.  
The ravulizumab finished product is filled into a Crystal Zenith (cyclic-olefin polymer resin) cartridge 
stoppered with a FluroTec coated piston. 
Ravulizumab SC is directly administered with the OBDS from the PFC without dilution. The essential 
performance requirements (EPR) of the drug-device combination product were confirmed by design 
verification activities, demonstrating that the use of ravulizumab with OBI is safe and effective. 
The on-body injector component must comply with the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The 
applicant has included in the dossier detailed information on the on-body delivery system that support 
its suitability for the intended use. In addition, the MAH has the responsibility to ensure that the co-
packaged device is CE marked in accordance with the relevant EU legislation on medical devices prior 
to placing the product on the market.  
The assembly process for the combination product is performed at ADMF. Design validation and 
verification plans were executed successfully. A biological risk assessment of the OBDS confirmed that 
the likelihood of a toxic effect is negligible and the OBDS can be considered safe for the intended use. 
Process Performance Qualification for ODBS assembly was successfully demonstrated with three 
consecutive PPQ runs. 
In general, the quality of the product is good and the dossier is presented in a comprehensible 
manner.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was one unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertains to the review and tightening of the specification limit 
for C5 binding. This point is put forward and agreed as a recommendation for future quality 
development.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
The MAH is recommended to reassess the acceptance criterion for C5 binding in the finished 
product release specifications when additional finished product release data are available.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Ultomiris (ravulizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to and blocks complement 
mediated  activation  of  complement  component  5  (C5),  thereby  preventing  the  release  of  the 
proinflammatory anaphylatoxin C5a and formation of the terminal complement complex (TCC) via C5b. 
Approved  in  the  2018,  is  indicated  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  paroxysmal  nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria (PNH) or atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). 
This  extension  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  concerns  a  new  route  of  administration  (subcutaneous 
injection) associated with a new strength (245 mg/3.5 mL (70 mg/ mL)) for Ultomiris.  
A complete nonclinical information package was included in the original electronic CTD for ULTOMIRIS 
(ravulizumab IV), presented in 2018. Additional nonclinical studies were not performed to support the 
development of the new SC formulation.  
A number of nonclinical pharmacology, PK, PD, and toxicology studies were conducted to support the 
clinical  testing  of  ravulizumab  IV  in  humans.  The  applicant  claims  that  the  systemic  safety  profile  of 
ravulizumab SC has been well demonstrated from the non clinical toxicological testing conducted for the 
IV formulation.  
An additional SC study in rabbits was performed to evaluate the local tolerability following single and 
repeated  SC  injections  of  ravulizumab.  From  the  non  clinical  point  of  view  this  study  is  considered 
relevant for this application. 
Two Protocol Assistance procedures were conducted with the EMA for ravulizumab SC, with 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/581075/2017 and EMA/CHMP/SAWP/475997/2018 procedures containing non 
clinical advice. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
No additional nonclinical pharmacology studies have been submitted for ravulizumab SC. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No additional nonclinical PK studies have been submitted for ravulizumab SC. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
A Local Irritation Study with Subcutaneous Formulation of ALXN1210, up to 15 days duration (GLP) in 
rabbits using the ALXN1210 SC formulation (batch 16R1501A) was provided in the original dossier.  
2.5.4.1.  Local tolerance  
The test article was formulated at a higher concentration (100 mg/mL) with different excipients than the 
current IV formulation (10 mg/mL) being studied in human trials. The SC formulation was administered 
to NZW rabbits at doses of 0, 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg. The study had 2 phases: a single dose phase (Phase 
A) in which rabbits were dosed on Day 1 and necropsied on Day 2 or Day 15, and a repeat-dose phase 
(Phase B) in which rabbits were dosed on Days 1 and 8 and surviving animals were necropsied on Days 
24 or 25. Rabbits in Phase B were intended to be dosed weekly for 4 weeks, but dosing was stopped 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 19/119 
 
 
 
after  Day  8  due  to  the  onset  of  clinical  signs.  Assessment  of  toxicity  was  based  on  mortality,  clinical 
observations,  body  weight,  injection  site  dermal  irritation  scoring,  immunohistochemistry  evaluation, 
and  anatomic  and  clinical  pathology.  Toxicokinetic  and  anti-drug  antibody  (ADA)  assessments  were 
conducted for the test article. 
During Phase A, there were mild clinical signs of skin discoloration which occurred at the injection site 
within  4  to  6  hours  post-dose  in  a  limited  number  of  animals  at  100  mg/kg.  Skin  discoloration  was 
observed in other areas of the body (ie, scrotal region) beginning on Day 8 in animals administered 60 
or 100 mg/kg. There was evidence of an inflammatory/immune response at all dose levels as indicated 
by  effects  on  fibrinogen,  neutrophils,  platelets,  albumin,  globulin,  albumin/globulin  ratios,  activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and/or cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, MCP-1 and IP-10). There were 
decreases  in  red  cell  mass  and  reticulocytes,  with  associated  alterations  to  erythrocyte  morphology 
typical  of  membrane  injury.  This  collection  of  findings  was  likely  multifactorial  as  related  to  erythroid 
suppression  secondary  to  inflammation,  and  immune/complement-mediated  erythrocyte  injury.  No 
histological findings were detected. 
During Phase B, severe clinical signs of skin discoloration/blackening of the scrotal region, nose/muzzle 
and/or  ears  were  observed  in  several  animals  approximately  3  days  following  the  second  dose 
administration. The most severely affected animals (7 animals) were euthanized in extremis due to the 
rapid progression and severity of the clinical signs. This included one animal in the 30 mg/kg/week, 2 
animals in the 60 mg/kg/week, and 4 animals in the 100 mg/kg/week groups. One additional animal in 
the 30 mg/kg/week group was euthanized near the end of the study (Day 23). 
The main findings in Phase B animals euthanized were moderate to marked renal injury and inflammatory 
effects as indicated by increases in urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphorus, fibrinogen, IL-6, MCP-1, IP10, 
and/or  neutrophils.  Other  findings  consisted  of  mild  to  moderate  decreases  in  red  cell  mass  with 
concurrent  evidence  of  regeneration  and  occasional  spherocytosis.  These  findings  were  probably 
multifactorial 
in  nature  but 
largely 
test  article-related  and  consistent  with  an 
immune 
complex/complement-mediated  hemolytic  component.  Pathologic  findings  were  focused  on  or  around 
small to medium-sized blood vessels in multiple tissues. Macroscopic findings included discoloration of 
varying severities in a number of tissues (ears, skin, skin, subcutis, epididymides, and lung with bronchi). 
Vascular/perivascular  inflammation,  thrombi,  with  occasional  necrosis  and/or  hemorrhage,  were 
predominant in the peripheral skin but were also observed in visceral organs (ears, scrotum, injection 
sites, testes, epididymides, kidney, lungs, and heart).  
Immunohistochemistry evaluations revealed granular deposits, which generally contained human 
Immunoglobulin G (IgG), rabbit IgG, rabbit Immunoglobulin M (IgM), and/or complement fraction, C3. 
The proximity between sites of granular immune complex deposition and sites of histopathology 
findings are suggestive of immune complex formation and/or deposition likely mediated the observed 
vascular/perivascular findings. Based on the spectrum of findings, these are most consistent with 
immune complex-mediated systemic disease. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According CHMP guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) with effective date of December 2006, states that vitamins, electrolytes, 
amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted of environmental risk 
assessment because, due to their nature they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the 
environment. Due to the fact that ravulizumab is a monoclonal antibody and thus a protein, no 
Environmental Risk Assessment is provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 20/119 
 
 
 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A full nonclinical package was included in the original MAA for Ultomiris presented in 2018. No additional 
nonclinical data have been generated. This is considered acceptable. 
It is agreed that the non-clinical systemic toxicity studies with the IV formulation are directly applicable 
to ravulizumab SC. Moreover, non-clinical efficacy from pharmacology studies can be extrapolated to the 
new  route  of  administration.  The  potential  risk  of  ravulizumab  SC  from  a  toxicological  point  of  view 
concerns local tolerance and immunogenicity, which has been addressed in a local tolerance study using 
SC administration in rabbits. Toxicokinetics has been addressed in the same study.  
The SC formulation of ravulizumab did not show any relevant local adverse effects when administered 
as  a  single  injection,  or  prior  to  the  development  of  anti-drug  antibodies.  However,  the  repeated  SC 
administration  caused  severe  immune  response-related  adverse  events  in  rabbits  indicative  of  a 
systemic,  type  III  hypersensitivity  response  with  an  immune  complex  etiology,  attributed  to  the 
development  of  ADAs  as  the  applicant  states.  It  is  widely  acknowledged  that  immunogenicity  and 
hypersensitivity reactions to human biopharmaceuticals in animals are not predictive of the potential for 
these effects in humans (see ICH S6(R1)), consequently these findings have questionable relevance for 
patients. Use of alternative species are not warranted since ravulizumab does not exhibit pharmacologic 
activity or cross reactivity with any non-human animal species tested, including cynomolgus monkey, 
thus no additional non-clinical studies are required. Immunogenicity has been study in the clinical trials 
with ravulizumab SC. 
The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, ravulizumab is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
In conclusion, available non-clinical data are sufficient to support the authorisation of the ravulizumab 
SC formulation. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that the available non-clinical data are sufficient to support the authorisation of the 
ravulizumab SC formulation.

•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The Ultomiris SC clinical program comprises 3 clinical studies: one Phase 3 registrational 
pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD), efficacy and safety study in adult patients with PNH 
(Study ALXN1210-PNH-303) and 2 supportive Phase 1 PK and safety studies in healthy adult subjects 
(Studies ALXN1210-HV-105 and ALXN1210-SC-101).

Bioavailability studies and related analytical methods 
The bioavailability of ravulizumab SC was assessed in healthy adult subjects in clinical Studies 
ALXN1210-SC-101 (assessed previously) and ALXN1210-HV-105. 
The quantitation of ravulizumab in plasma from study ALXN1210-HV-105 is considered fully validated 
and it is acceptable. 
The relative bioavailability Study ALXN1210-HV-105 demonstrate that the absolute bioavailability of 
ravulizumab SC administered alone was approximately 64%, and when co-administered with rHuPH20 
resulted in a mean increased absolute bioavailability of ravulizumab SC of approximately 22%. 
However, after completion of this study, ravulizumab SC co-administered with rHuPH20 was not 
considered for further development.

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter 
study to evaluate PK non-inferiority of ravulizumab SC administered via an OBI compared with 
ravulizumab IV in adult patients with PNH who are clinically stable and have been previously treated 
with eculizumab for at least 3 months prior to study entry. The primary objective of this study was to 
evaluate the PK non-inferiority of ravulizumab SC versus ravulizumab IV based on the Day 71 Ctrough.  
Mean steady-state trough concentrations for the SC and IV groups were approximately 34% and 57% 
higher than those observed on Day 71, respectively.

Elimination 
The elimination of ravulizumab was similar between the SC and IV routes of administration. Following a 
single dose of ravulizumab SC; the median (range) time to maximum observed serum concentration 
(tmax) was 169.8 (96.0 to 508.1) hours following SC injection. The geometric mean (coefficient of 
variation [CV]%) terminal elimination half-life (t½) was similar at 31.3 (13.6) days and 
29.9 (15.4) days for ravulizumab SC and IV administration, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic in the target population 
A total of 185 subjects were treated with ravulizumab IV or SC across study ALXN1210-SC-101, 
ALXN1210-HV-105 and ALXN1210-PNH-303. Healthy subjects (ALXN1210-SC-101 and ALXN1210-HV-
105) received single IV or SC doses or ravulizumab and patients with PNH (ALXN1210-PNH-303) 
received IV or SC doses during the randomized treatment period (10 weeks) and SC doses during the 
extension period (refer to Table 1). Of these 185 subjects, 7 subjects from clinical site 0657 in study 
ALXN1210-PNH-303 (6 for the SC and 1 for the IV) were removed from the analysis due to critical 
findings related to deficiencies in source documentation and principal investigator oversight, as well as 
4 major findings. As a result, a total of 178 subjects were included in the population PK analysis.

Steady-state concentrations of ravulizumab following IV and SC dosing 
The final population PK model was used to perform simulations in order to assess steady state 
concentration profiles following dosing over 1 year (i.e., no switch from IV to SC on Day 71). Model-
predicted mean (95% prediction interval) concentration-times profiles of ravulizumab following SC and 
IV are presented in Figure below.

Based on model-predicted concentrations, the geometric mean ratio (GMR) for the SC to IV 
comparison on Day 1 and 351 (steady state) were 1.213 and 1.392, respectively. The GMR on Day 71 
based on model-predicted concentrations is consistent with the reported GMR with an ANOVA model 
for the stage 1 analysis (1.176) and for the weighted overall results (1.257). 
Switching from IV to SC and SC to IV 
The final population PK model was used to perform simulations in order to assess the impact of 
switching from IV to SC and from SC to IV. Simulations were performed following achievement of 
steady state concentrations of ravulizumab following IV and SC administration (i.e., 6 months). Model-

Patients with PNH currently treated with eculizumab were enrolled in study ALXN1210-PNH-303. As a 
result, all free C5 concentrations prior to ravulizumab dosing on Day 1 were below 0.5 μg/mL due to 
residual concentrations of eculizumab, with the exception of 2 subjects. 
Following IV dosing on Day 1 and 15 in the IV treatment arm, all free C5 concentrations were below 
0.5 μg/mL. All free C5 concentrations were maintained below 0.5 μg/mL following initiation of SC 
dosing on Day 71 and onward. 
For the SC treatment arm, all free C5 concentrations were below 0.5 μg/mL following IV dosing on Day 
1. All free C5 concentrations were maintained below 0.5 μg/mL following initiation of SC dosing on Day

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioavailability: The non-inferiority analysis of ravulizumab after SC vs. IV administration demonstrated 
that Ctrough concentrations are from 23-27% higher based on the dataset considered. The lower limit 
of the 90% CI of the GMR was higher than the unity, showing that statistically higher exposure is 
expected with the proposed dosing regimen compared to IV administration.  
Elimination: The elimination of ravulizumab was similar between the SC and IV routes of 
administration. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
A previously developed population PK model structure (two-compartment model with linear clearance) 
has been proposed including first order absorption process with absorption lag-time to describe the 
pharmacokinetic properties of ravulizumab after SC administration. Statistical covariate effects 
previously identified were considered for SC data, which is endorsed. Therefore, the modelling strategy 
is endorsed.  
Overall, the model structure seems plausible and able to characterize the time-course of SC 
ravulizumab in PNH patients. However, minor discrepancies were observed in healthy volunteers based 
on the model performance from pc-VPC (Study ALX1210-HV-105), where the model clearly under-
predicted the Cmax concentrations after SC administration, possibly due to a slight bias in the 
bioavailability estimation for the syringe pump compared to manual injection. Model performance in 
PNH patients (Study ALXN1210-PNH-303) did not show any major deviation due to the influence in the 
estimation of F from healthy volunteers. 
The clinical relevance has been evaluated in Cmin,ss and Cmax,ss. Extreme body weight and healthy 
subjects vs patients did show clinically relevant changes in the exposure metrics, as previously 
observed for IV ravulizumab. However, clinically relevant changes in exposure (>20%) did not result in 
clinically meaningful limitations in terms of efficacy or safety, based on the model-based analysis that 
the applicant has provided. Based on the efficacy (175 micrograms/mL) and safety (2680 
micrograms/mL) thresholds, the 95% prediction interval for each scenario did not overcame the 
therapeutic range, showing no compromise in terms of response.  
Dose extrapolation of ravulizumab in aHUS patients 
Regarding the extrapolation of qw ravulizumab SC maintenance dose of 490 mg in adult patients with 
aHUS, so far the evidence suggested similar PK behaviour across both disease conditions (aHUS and 
PNH) after IV administration. Despite no experimental PK evidence has been collected after SC 
administration, it is highly unexpected that differences in the absorption could be present due to 
differences in the disease conditions. Therefore, since no differences in ravulizumab disposition were 
detected after IV administration and similar exposure was demonstrated between SC and IV in PNH 
patients, it seems adequate to support the extrapolation of similar PK and PD behaviour of ravulizumab 
in aHUS patients.  
Dose extrapolation of ravulizumab in complement inhibitor-naïve adult patients 
The extrapolation of ravulizumab SC in complement inhibitor-naïve adult patients across all body 
weight groups seems adequate based on the previous evidence after ravulizumab IV administration.  
Dose extrapolation of ravulizumab in patients with body weight ≥100 kg 
Regarding the extrapolation of ravulizumab SC 490 mg in patients with body weight ≥100 kg, the 
applicant has conducted a simulation-based analysis to highlight that the predicted exposure in a 
virtual population with a median body weight of 110 kg will be above the efficacy threshold of 175 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 41/119 
 
 
 
μg/mL. Body weight has been identified as a clinically relevant covariate on disposition parameters 
(CL, V, Q and Vp), showing clinically relevant changes in exposure (>20%) in patients with body weigh 
>95 kg and <51 kg (Figure 6 Population PK report). Therefore, differences in exposure have been 
quantitatively characterized and model-predicted exposure indicates that 90% of patients with body 
weight between 100 and 157 kg would show exposure levels above the efficacy threshold, which 
demonstrates the adequacy of the current posology. 
Exposure-response relationship 
The exposure-efficacy relationships between ravulizumab concentrations and serum free C5 
concentrations did not identify any clinically relevant difference between patients from the IV and SC 
arms. All concentrations were below the efficacy threshold (0.5 micrograms/mL) after IV and SC, 
suggesting no differences in efficacy are expected.  
The exposure-safety analysis did not identify any relevant difference in terms of treatment emergent 
adverse events or adverse device reaction after Cmax,ss ravulizumab concentrations. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The characterization of the PK properties, immunogenicity and pharmacodynamic of SC ravulizumab 
has been developed in a clinical program that comprises 3 clinical studies (one Phase 3 and two Phase 
1 studies).  
The adequacy of the population PK model to characterize the time-course of ravulizumab after SC has 
been demonstrated in PNH patients and healthy volunteers. Similar structural population PK model as 
developed for IV administration has been applied, demonstrating adequate model performance. Based 
on it, model-based analysis to support the extrapolation of use in naïve PNH patients, patients with 
body weight >100 kg and inter-change between IV and SC administration can be considered 
informative to support its extrapolation. No differences in terms of response are expected based on the 
exposure predictions conducted in none of these scenarios.  
The exposure-response analysis was evaluated over efficacy (serum free C5 concentrations) and safety 
endpoints, suggesting no differences between SC and IV administration. Therefore, no changes could 
be expected in the exposure-response profile in patients receiving SC vs. IV ravulizumab. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Ultomiris SC is a drug-device combination product comprised of a PFC containing 70 mg/mL 
ravulizumab (drug constituent) co-packaged with a single-use administration on-body injection (OBI). 
The Ultomiris SC clinical program comprises 3 clinical studies (Table below):  
• 
one Phase 3 registrational pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD), efficacy and safety 
study in adult patients with PNH (Study ALXN1210-PNH-303; N= 128), and  
•  2 supportive Phase 1 PK and safety studies in healthy adult subjects (Studies ALXN1210-HV-
105 (N=49) and ALXN1210-SC-101 (N=105)).

2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No specific dose-finding studies have been reported. 
A single dose of ravulizumab SC 400 mg, administered consecutively as 4 separate 100-mg injections, 
was evaluated in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study and preliminary data indicated ravulizumab SC 400 
mg was generally well-tolerated and without any safety concerns. 
The proposed weekly dosing regimen of ravulizumab SC 490 mg to be evaluated in the Phase 3 study 
(Study ALXN1210-PNH-303) was identified by integrating the available Phase 1 PK data from Study 
ALXN1210-SC-101 and from the ravulizumab IV clinical development program using a modelling and 
simulation framework. A fixed SC maintenance dose of 490 mg for patients weighing ≥ 40 to < 100 kg 
starting 2 weeks following an IV loading dose was expected to maintain serum drug concentrations 
above the target concentration needed for complete inhibition of terminal complement in all adult 
patients weighing ≥ 40 to < 100 kg from the start of the treatment.

This study was also designed to assess the performance of the ravulizumab OBDS drug/device product 
(is a drug/device combination product, also referred to as ravulizumab on-body delivery system). 
The study consists of an up to a 30-day Screening Period, a 10-week Randomized Treatment 
Period, and an Extension Period of up to 172 weeks or until the product is registered or approved 
(in accordance with country-specific regulations), whichever occurred first. A safety follow-up 
consisting of a phone call occurs 30 days after the last dose of ravulizumab.

Patients were stratified by weight group (≥40 kg to <60 kg and ≥60 kg to <100 kg) and then 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ravulizumab SC or ravulizumab IV.  
During the Randomized Treatment Period, patients assigned to the ravulizumab SC group received a 
weight-based loading dose of ravulizumab IV on Day 1, followed by maintenance doses of ravulizumab 
SC on Day 15 and every week (qw) thereafter through completion of the Randomized Treatment Period 
(Day 71). Patients assigned to the ravulizumab IV group received a weight-based loading dose of 
ravulizumab IV on Day 1 followed by a maintenance dose of ravulizumab IV on Day 15. After 
completion of the Randomized Treatment Period (Day 71), all patients received ravulizumab SC qw 
during the Extension Period.

has a range of 0% to 100%, with a high score representing a higher 
response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a high 
level of functioning, but a high score for a symptom scale represents a 
high level of symptomatology/problem (Version 3.0). 
TASQ-IV and TASQ-SC  A validated (Doll, 2021; Theodore-Oklota, 2016) questionnaire that 
assesses patients’ perceptions and satisfaction with eculizumab IV (TASQ-
IV) or ravulizumab SC (TASQ-SC) treatment administration routes, which 
includes 5 domains: physical impact, psychological impact, impact on 
activities of daily living, convenience, and satisfaction. Each domain offers 
up to 5 response options with lower scores indicating a more positive 
response; scoring is completed by summing each of the 5 domains.

•  Sample size 
Assuming the ratio of the geometric means of Ctrough (SC/IV) is 1.03 and the coefficient of variation 
(CV) is 0.4 (or, equivalently, difference of means is 0.03 and standard deviation is 0.39), 62 patients in 
the ravulizumab SC group and 31 patients in the ravulizumab IV comparison group will achieve 90% 
power to detect non-inferiority, using a one-sided test at an alpha level of 0.05 and a PK non-inferiority 
margin (NIM) of 0.8 (or, equivalently, -0.22 for the difference of means). 
The alpha level and NIM are based on recommendations in guidance documents “Statistical Approaches 
to Establishing Bioequivalence” and “Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence”, from the US 
Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, respectively. This sample size is 
increased to 105 patients (70 patients in the ravulizumab SC group and 35 patients in the ravulizumab 
IV group) to account for the possibility that approximately 10% of patients may not meet the criteria 
for inclusion in the PK analysis set. An interim analysis to evaluate futility and perform a sample size 
re-estimation was planned. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Randomization 
Each patient was randomly assigned to a treatment group in a 2:1 ratio (SC:IV) using a centralized 
interactive web response system. Patients were stratified by weight groups (≥ 40 to < 60 kg and ≥ 60 
to < 100 kg). 
Blinding: 
This is an open-label study.

a All patients (n = 7) from 1 site were excluded from the primary PK, PD, Per Protocol, FAS, SC Treated FAS,

Statistical hypothesis 
The alternative hypothesis (HA) is that the Day 71 Ctrough concentration of patients treated with 
ravulizumab SC via an OBDS is non-inferior to that of patients treated with ravulizumab IV: 
Were δ is the non-inferiority margin. 
Primary Analysis: 
The primary analysis was based on the PK analysis set. The primary endpoint is the Day 71 serum 
ravulizumab Ctrough. While non-inferiority is not being assessed at the interim, descriptive statistics 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 49/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the point estimate are used for the sample size re-estimation and futility analysis. 
Futility Analysis 
When approximately 50% (minimum n=51) of the planned patients have been assessed for the 
primary endpoint, the primary efficacy interim analysis is conducted. The initial part of the analysis 
was to assess futility in order to allow the Sponsor to stop the study early if it is unlikely to lead to a 
significant final result. Following the futility assessment, but using the same set of patients and data, 
an interim sample size re-estimation analysis to reassess the required size of the study based on 
estimation of the primary endpoint was performed.  
The above analysis provides information to determine whether early stopping for futility is warranted 
based on the expected treatment effect at the time of the interim analysis. 
A nonbinding futility boundary based on conditional power for non-inferiority (CPni) of 20% is used so 
that if the Sponsor decides to continue the study, even if the futility boundary is crossed, there will be 
no impact to the primary analysis Type I error rate. The interim analysis is constructed to control the 
probability of overall type 1 error at 0.05, 1-sided. On the Z-scale the efficacy boundary at final 
analysis is c=1.645, as computed in EAST 6.4.  
Table 14 Criteria for Futility Analysis and Sample Size Re-estimation 
Effect of Interim Analysis on Final Analysis 
Since the sample size may be increased in a data-dependent manner after the interim analysis, use of 
the conventional Z-statistic at the final analysis may lead to inflation of type 1 error as demonstrated 
by Cui et al. (1999). These authors have shown that one way to control for such type 1 error inflation 
is to use a weighted combination test, in which the independent increments of the Z-statistics of the 2 
stages are combined by pre-specified weights that are computed based on the planned stage 1 and 
stage 2 sample sizes, 
 and 
 (with or without sample size increase). This weighted combination test 
is henceforth referred to as the CHW test. In the present case, the study is designed to have an

interim analysis at approximately 50% information. The CHW test will use weights that equal:

•  Conduct of the study 
Since the original protocol (dated 25 June 2018), 4 global amendments have been made to the protocol. 
A summary of changes in the conduct of the study that were implemented by protocol amendments is 
provided in the Table below.  
The Administrative Letter dated 26 May 2020 provided clarification that the duration of the Extension 
Period is up to 172 weeks, for a total study treatment duration of up to 3.5 years (182 weeks). 
Table 15 Summary of Protocol Changes 
Protocol deviations: 
Important deviations were reported by 39% (3/136) of patients, with the incidence evenly distributed 
across treatment groups. Details on each type of deviation are provided below.  
To ensure the quality of the study results, all patients from a noncompliant investigative site were 
excluded from analyses due to important source documentation deviations and findings related to 
deficiencies in Investigator oversight.

Table 16 Patients With Important Protocol Deviations as of Data Cut-off Date (Enrolled 
Analysis Set) 
Although 20 patients had important protocol deviations classified in the eligibility and entry criteria 
category, these deviations did not affect the interpretation of the study results.  
Important protocol deviations leading to exclusion from analysis sets: 
Seven patients from 1 site (Site 0657) had important protocol deviations related to source 
documentation (eg, clinical research associate was not able to confirm the traceability, accuracy, and 
validity of source document[s] against the eCRF due to multiple sources). 
The important protocol deviations noted at this site were further evaluated during a ‘for-cause’ audit 
resulting in the exclusion of the patients enrolled at this site from the primary PK Analysis Set, FAS, PD 
Analysis Set, Safety Analysis Set, SC Treated FAS, and the SC Treated Safety Analysis Set.

Disease history and characteristics 
Table 18 Disease Characteristics (FAS) 
In this study population of patients with stable disease, 18.6% of patients (24/129) had a history of 
packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions in the year prior to first dose of study intervention. The 
percentage of patients receiving pRBC transfusions within 1 year prior to first dose was 24.4% in the 
IV group and 15.5% in the SC group. 
The mean number of transfusions within 1 year prior to first dose was higher in the ravulizumab SC 
group than in the ravulizumab IV group, as was the mean number of units transfused. This difference 
was attributable to 1 heavily transfusion-dependent patient in the ravulizumab SC group.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Objective: PK Non-inferiority  
This is to demonstrate the non-inferiority in Day 71 serum ravulizumab Ctrough of ravulizumab 
subcutaneous (SC) administration compared with ravulizumab intravenous (IV) administration. 
This point is discussed in the clinical Pharmacology section. 
Secondary Endpoints  
Efficacy – Randomized Treatment Period 
Efficacy results for the Randomized Treatment Period (through Day 71) are presented for the FAS. 
Efficacy analyses and results using the Modified FAS, which included the 7 patients from the non-
compliant site, were similar when compared with the FAS for all of the efficacy endpoints. 
Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) 
During the Randomized Treatment Period, mean LDH levels remained stable over time in both 
treatment groups for the FAS.  
Mean percent change in LDH from baseline to Day 71 was 2.57% for the SC group and 5.73% for the 
IV group.

upper limit of the normal range. Source: Figure 14.2.2.1.1.1 
Breakthrough hemolysis 
Breakthrough hemolysis was defined as having at least 1 new or worsening symptom or sign of 
intravascular hemolysis (fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath [dyspnea], 
anemia [hemoglobin < 10 g/dL], MAVE (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction) in 
the presence of elevated LDH ≥ 2 × ULN as assessed by the central laboratory. 
Two patients experienced BTH during the Randomized Treatment Period (through Day 71): 1 patient in 
the IV group at Day 57 and 1 patient in the SC group at Day 71. 
The events of BTH were reviewed in an effort to evaluate the etiological factors involved, including 
time-matched PD parameters and/or presence of an infection or other potential complement amplifying 
condition (CAC), such as trauma, surgery, or pregnancy (Brodsky, 2017; Risitano, 2012; Sharma, 
2015). Adverse events temporally associated with the onset of BTH were also reviewed for each 
patient to evaluate for potential infections or other CAC. 
Neither of these events of BTH were associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition (defined as free C5 ≥ 0.5 
μg/mL). Note that the patient in the IV group experiencing BTH on Day 57 did not have a free C5 
sample obtained at the Day 57 visit; however, this patient showed complete C5 control at all other 
sampling time points. The patient in the SC group had a Grade 1 viral infection from Days 55 to 65 
prior to the BTH event that was reported on Day 71. 
Transfusion avoidance 
The majority of patients in both treatment groups in the FAS avoided pRBC transfusion during the 
Randomized Treatment Period (IV group: 86.7%; SC group: 94.0%). 
Stabilized haemoglobin 
The majority of patients in both treatment groups in the FAS maintained stabilized haemoglobin during 
the Randomized Treatment Period (IV group: 81.8%; SC group: 93.6%). Stabilized haemoglobin was 
defined as the avoidance of a ≥ 2 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin level from baseline in the absence of 
transfusion through Day 71.

Clinical manifestations of PNH 
During the Randomized Treatment Period, the percentage of patients with any clinical manifestations 
of PNH was similar in both treatment groups in the FAS (IV group: 46.7%; SC group: 47.6%). Fatigue 
was the most common symptom (IV group: 18/21 [85.7%]; SC group: 34/40 [85%]). 
Reticulocyte count 
During the Randomized Treatment Period, reticulocyte count levels remained stable over time in both 
treatment groups for the FAS.

HRQoL and Treatment Administration Satisfaction – Randomized Treatment Period 
FACIT-Fatigue 
The mean FACIT-Fatigue subscale scores at baseline were similar between the treatment groups (IV 
group: 42.10; SC group: 40.29) and remained stable over time in both treatment groups for the FAS 
during the Randomized Treatment Period.  
The percentages of patients with a change of ≥ +3 points at Day 71 compared to baseline in FACIT-
Fatigue subscale score were similar in both treatment groups (IV group: 27.3%; SC group: 35.0%). 
EORTC QLQ-C30 
Mean EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 scale (QLQ-C30) global health status scores were 
similar between the treatment groups at baseline (IV group: 73.15, SC group: 74.07) and remained 
stable in both treatment groups over time for the FAS during the Randomized Treatment Period. 
At baseline, for both treatment groups, mean EORTC QLQ-C30 subscale scores reflected a patient 
population with stable disease: Global Health Status and Physical Functioning subscale scores were 
high, ranging from 73% to 83% across treatment groups, and Fatigue subscale scores were low, 
ranging from 25% to 27%). 
Treatment Administration Satisfaction 
The TASQ is a 19-item validated questionnaire designed to assess patients’ perception and satisfaction 
with treatment administration routes (Doll, 2021). The TASQ scores treatment administration 
Assessment report

satisfaction across 5 domains: physical impact, psychological impact, impact on ADL, convenience, and 
satisfaction. Each domain offers up to 5 response options with lower scores indicating a more positive 
response. Scoring is completed by summing each of the 5 domains. 
Two versions of the TASQ were administered to patients: 
•  The TASQ-IV: based on the patient’s most recent eculizumab IV administration 
•  The TASQ-SC: based on the patient’s most recent ravulizumab SC administration 
At baseline, mean total TASQ scores for the IV route of administration for eculizumab were similar 
between the treatment groups (Table 19). At the end of the Randomized Treatment Period (Day 71), 
the mean (SD) change from baseline in total TASQ score was -7.00 (34.581) for the IV group and -
70.54 (70.522) for the SC group.

Notes 
The PK Analysis Set excluded 23 patients (IV=3, SC=20): 9 patients due to dosing 
errors; 1 patient who withdrew from the study prior to Day 71; 7 patients due to 
important deviations and findings related to deficiencies in source documentation and 
Investigator oversight; and 8 patients due to other important protocol deviations that 
resulted in non-evaluable PK data.  
Treatment with ravulizumab SC achieved statistically significant PK non-inferiority 
compared with ravulizumab IV treatment for the primary endpoint, Day 71 trough 
concentration (Ctrough), as shown by a geometric least squares mean ratio of 1.257 
(90% confidence interval [CI]: 1.160, 1.361) at Day 71, where the lower bound of the 
90% CI was greater than the prespecified non-inferiority boundary of 0.80. 
In addition, the PK non-inferiority of SC versus IV was consistent across all pre-specified 
sensitivity analyses.

Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects 
Efficacy data in Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 were analyzed up to the SC Day 351 visit. LDH levels 
remained stable over the duration of treatment with no evidence of loss of therapeutic effect over 
time. The mean percentage change in LDH from Baseline to SC Day 351 was 0.92%.

These results are consistent with observations made in studies in patients with PNH and aHUS treated 
with ravulizumab IV for up to 100 weeks: 
• 
Long-term data available from the 39 patients who entered the Extension Periods of Phase 1b and 
Phase 2 Studies ALXN1210-PNH-103 and ALXN1210-PNH-201, respectively, indicate that patients 
with PNH continue to maintain efficacy up to 100 weeks in terms of LDH suppression and increase 
in hemoglobin value over time (PNH Adult IV). Additionally, data on LDH levels over 52 weeks of 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 70/119 
 
 
 
treatment indicated similar maintenance of efficacy in the Phase 3 PNH studies (Kulasekararaj, 
2019). 
• 
The Phase 3 efficacy data from 56 adult patients with aHUS treated with ravulizumab showed 
sustained therapeutic effect during the 6-month Primary Evaluation Period. For patients 
continuing in the Extension Period, the sustained therapeutic effect was maintained through 52 
weeks of treatment (ALXN1210 aHUS 311 52-week). 
The cumulative ravulizumab experience as of 30 Jun 2021 comprises a clinical database of 2,036.5 
patient-years, and a postmarketing database of approximately 3,996.7 patient-years (Ravulizumab 
Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report [PBRER] #5). Loss of efficacy has not been observed with 
ravulizumab treatment. 
Based on the posology support described in Section 4, efficacy in PNH or aHUS patients receiving 
ravulizumab SC treatment is expected to be similar to that observed following ravulizumab IV 
treatment.

Not applicable. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The current submission for MA is supported by one parallel-group Phase 3 study (ALXN1210-PNH-303; 
N=129) for ravulizumab (ALXN1210) SC, based on bridging efficacy data from ALXN1210 IV on the 
basis of pharmacokinetic non-inferiority principles, for the treatment of PNH adult patients previously 
treated with eculizumab. 
The following indication was initially proposed: 
Ultomiris subcutaneous formulation (Ultomiris SC) is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with 
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH): 
• 
• 
in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity. 
in patients who are currently treated with eculizumab or with ravulizumab intravenous 
formulation (Ultomiris IV). 
Ultomiris SC is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome 
(aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or are currently treated with eculizumab or 
ravulizumab IV. 
The proposed posology is 490 mg once a week in adult patients with a body weigh ≥40 kg. Moreover, 
a ravulizumab IV loading dose is required prior to the initiation of ravulizumab SC for complement-
inhibitor treatment-naïve patients or patients switching treatment from eculizumab. 
The analyses presented in this report are based on a database lock date of 02 April 2021 (data cut-off 
date 2 Feb 2021). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 (N=128) is a randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 
study to establish the non-inferior PK of ravulizumab SC OBDS as compared to ravulizumab IV in adult 
patients with PNH who are clinically stable and have been treated with eculizumab for at least 3 
months prior to study entry. Masking is not applicable, since the study is open-label. This is acceptable 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 71/119 
 
 
 
for the ALXN1210-PNH-303 pivotal study, considering the different routes of administration (SC vs. 
IV). 
The purpose of this study (ALXN1210-PNH-303) is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, 
tolerability and safety of the SC formulation of ravulizumab in adult patients with PNH whose disease is 
controlled by a standard treatment with eculizumab at the currently approved dose (900 mg IV every 
14 days). The design of the proposed SC trial in adult patients with PNH consisted in an up to 30-day 
Screening Period, a 10-week Randomized Treatment Period, and an Extension Period of up to 
172 weeks with PK non-inferiority primary and secondary endpoints at Week 10 (Day 71) and 26 
(Day 183), respectively, followed by a 2-year extension period. Day 71 is the end of the Randomized 
Treatment Period and the beginning of the Extension Period. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria clearly define the target population. Of note, patients should have 
been treated with eculizumab for at least 3 months prior to study entry and had LDH levels ≤1.5 x 
ULN. Thus, there were no naïve patients in Study ALXN1210-PNH-303. Only patients with a body 
weight ≥40 to <100 kg were included in the study. 
The proposed primary endpoint is PK exposure (as measured by Day 71 Ctrough as parameter for 
comparison) with ALXN1210 SC to be compared with ALXN1210 IV dosing to be registered in the 
treatment of PNH. Secondary endpoints include PK exposure non-inferiority as measured by Day 183 
Ctrough, haemolysis as directly measured by LDH (the hallmark of PNH disease activity), breakthrough 
haemolysis, quality of life as measured by FACIT-fatigue, transfusion avoidance, and stabilized 
haemoglobin. Patient preference and satisfaction for treatment was also recorded at Day 183 of the 
study.  
The study design was aimed at demonstrating non-inferiority of ravulizumab SC to ravulizumab IV, 
defined mainly by pharmacokinetics. The selection of efficacy endpoints is supported, and as expected, 
they are in line with the ones proposed in the previous studies of ravulizumab IV. The non-inferiority 
design is acceptable.  
The proposed sample size is considered adequate. Additionally, stratification (by weight) and 
randomization (2:1 ratio, SC:IV) were used to minimize bias, and are as well supported. The European 
population is considered well represented. 
The posology and rationale for the SC dosing regimen in the conducted study is overall agreed (see 
PK/PD section). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 136 patients were enrolled and treated (46 in the ravulizumab IV treatment group and 90 in 
the ravulizumab SC treatment group). Screening failure was reported for 5 patients. Seven patients (1 
from the ravulizumab IV arm and 6 from the SC arm) from a single site were excluded due to 
important source documentation deviations (reported as quality issues), for both the FAS (understood 
as ITT population) and for the SC Treated Full Analysis Set (TFAS). These 7 patients were all enrolled 
in the same investigational site. Detailed information on the reasons that led to the exclusion of these 
patients has been provided and they were mainly related to the reliability of the data, affecting the 
ability to reconstruct and evaluate the activities performed by the site. Overall, considering that 7 
patients were excluded from the FAS, the total number of patients would be 129. Of note, one patient 
in the ravulizumab IV arm did not complete the Randomised Treatment Period and therefore did not 
enter the Extension Period. As a result, the total number of patients that received ravulizumab SC is 
128. The Per Protocol Analysis Set excluded 30 patients based on the pre-specified criteria outlined in 
the SAP (due to inclusion and exclusion criteria).

A single interim analysis (IA) was conducted when approximately 50% of the planned patients had 
been assessed for the primary endpoint. At the time of this IA, the MAH performed a sample size re-
estimation. The main intention for this interim analysis was to evaluate futility and to study the 
possibility of increasing the sample size up to 144 patients. According to the documentation provided, 
the recommendation by the independent statistician was to make no adjustment to the planned 
sample size. However, even if the planned sample size was of 105 patients, a total of 136 patients 
were finally included in the study. The applicant provided a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint 
based on the 106 first enrolled patients (PK analysis set n=88) showing that the difference with 
respect to the originally submitted analysis was minimal and confirming that the over-enrolment had 
no impact on the final analysis. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced across the treatment groups. Among the 
total population, 53.5% (69/129) of patients were female and 71.3% (92/129) of patients were White. 
The mean age was 45.7 years (18; 79) at enrolment with only 10.1% (13/129) of the patients >65 
years, and most patients (83.7%; 108/129) were in the baseline weight category ≥60 kg to <100 kg. 
As required by the study inclusion criteria, all 129 patients had a history of eculizumab use for at least 
3 months preceding study entry. 
Among the total population, the median time from PNH diagnosis to informed consent was 7.5 years 
(range: 0.6; 33). Mean LDH values at baseline were similar between the treatment groups (IV group: 
267 U/L [range: 90, 519]; SC group: 270 U/L [range: 125, 1260]). However, according to inclusion 
criteria patients should have LDH ≤1.5xULN (ULN=246 U/L) at Screening. Bearing in mind LDH values 
at baseline it seems that in some patients LDH value was >1.5xULN, and therefore might not be 
considered to have controlled PNH disease from prior eculizumab treatment. In this regard, the 
applicant has clarified that there were 8 patients with LDH values > 1.5 × ULN at baseline. However, at 
their Screening visit LDH values were ≤ 1.5 × ULN as required by protocol in all of the patients except 
for 1 male patient (1143-803) with a missing LDH value at Screening. According to the applicant, the 
missing LDH value was not discovered until after the patient entered the study and the patient was 
allowed to continue in the study. It can be assumed that data from an isolated patient would not have 
an impact in the study outcomes. However, the reported patients as noted above, even when meeting 
the inclusion criteria at the Screening visit do not actually fulfilled the criteria of controlled disease. As 
additional information regarding this issue, the applicant provided follow up efficacy data from 7 of 
these 8 patients with LDH values > 1.5 × ULN at baseline (the additional patient withdrew consent and 
this data are then not available). Overall clinical results of these patients were similar to the global 
population. 
All patients had confirmed diagnosis of PNH at Screening to quantify the percentage of PNH cells (clone 
size) in the peripheral blood. Overall, the FAS population had a mean total PNH RBC clone size of 
48.35%, mean total PNH granulocyte clone size of 77.22%, and mean total PNH monocyte clone size 
of 80.18%.  
The mean number of transfusions within 1 year prior to first dose was higher in the ravulizumab SC 
group than in the ravulizumab IV group, as was the mean number of units transfused. This difference 
was attributable to 1 heavily transfusion-dependent patient in the ravulizumab SC group. A total of 43 
(33.3%) patients had a history of major adverse vascular events. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results for the Randomized Treatment Period (through Day 71) were presented for the FAS 
(n=129). Efficacy analyses and results using the modified FAS (n=136), which included the 7 patients 
from the non-compliant site, were similar when compared with the FAS for all of the efficacy endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 73/119 
 
 
 
During the Randomized Treatment Period, mean LDH levels remained stable over time in both 
treatment groups for the FAS. Mean percent change in LDH from baseline to Day 71 was 2.57% for the 
SC group and 5.73% for the IV group. A 3-5% mean change is within the range of normal variability 
for LDH values and not clinically significant.  
Regarding Breakthrough Haemolysis (BTH), two patients experienced BTH during the Randomized 
Treatment Period (through Day 71): 1 patient in the IV group at Day 57 and 1 patient in the SC group 
at Day 71. Neither of these events of BTH were associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition (defined as 
free C5 ≥0.5 μg/mL). 
The majority of patients in both treatment groups in the FAS avoided pRBC transfusion during the 
Randomized Treatment Period (IV group: 86.7%; SC group: 94.0%). Similarly, the majority of patients 
in both treatment groups in the FAS maintained stabilized haemoglobin during the Randomized 
Treatment Period (IV group: 81.8%; SC group: 93.6%). Results were aligned in the other secondary 
variables of efficacy: clinical manifestations of PHN, reticulocyte count, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate, PNH RBC clone size. Regarding HRQoL and treatment administration satisfaction, assessments 
were similar in both arms. Overall, it can be considered that there was an improved treatment 
satisfaction with the SC administration. 
Subgroup analyses were performed stratified by weight group (≥40 kg to <60 kg and ≥60 kg to 
<100kg). Due to the small proportion of patients in the ≥40 to <60 kg weight group (16% of total 
patients in the FAS) it is difficult to extract conclusions in this subgroup. 
Regarding special subpopulations, it should be noted that patients who weighed <40 Kg and ≥100 kg 
were excluded from the study. Additionally, only 10.1% (13/129) of the patients were >65 years.  
The MAH has provided an additional comparison between key efficacy results from Study ALXN1210-
PNH-303 and Study ALXN1210-PNH-302 to support the similar efficacy observed with ravulizumab SC 
and ravulizumab IV treatment. Both studies enrolled eculizumab-experienced patients with PNH. Data 
are compared at 6 months of treatment, which was the primary endpoint for Study ALXN1210-PNH-
302. Although indirect comparisons are of limited value, the efficacy results for SC-treated patients 
from Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 appear consistent with those of IV-treated patients from 
Study ALXN1210-PNH-302, and these data are considered supportive. 
Furthermore, additional data to confirm persistence of efficacy and tolerance effects have been 
provided: efficacy data in Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 were analysed up to the SC Day 351 visit. LDH 
levels remained stable over the duration of treatment with no evidence of loss of therapeutic effect 
over time, with a mean percentage change in LDH from Baseline to SC Day 351 of 0.92%. These 
results are consistent with observations made in studies in patients with PNH and aHUS treated with 
ravulizumab IV for up to 100 weeks. Other efficacy endpoints remained overall consistent throughout 
the extension period. 
Overall, the reported results support efficacy in the target population. It is considered that efficacy 
results from Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 demonstrate that patients with PNH can be switched from 
eculizumab IV or Ultomiris IV to Ultomiris SC without loss of efficacy. 
Wording of the indication 
The MAH applied for an indication in adults with PNH and aHUS, including both patients newly 
diagnosed and patients previously treated with eculizumab. Extrapolation of data from the SC Phase 3 
study in patients with PNH to the aHUS indication and treatment naïve patients was considered 
acceptable (see PK/PD section). However, since extrapolation is mainly based on data generated with 
ravulizumab IV and results of study ALXN1210-PNH-303, in which ravulizumab SC was compared with 
ravulizumab IV, it was requested that the indication for the SC formulation should be in line with that 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 74/119 
 
 
 
of the IV formulation, since no further efficacy/safety data have been provided as part of this 
submission. The MAH amended the wording of the indication accordingly, also in line with what has 
been done in other approved medicinal products with a SC formulation. In addition, a minor change in 
the wording of the indication of the ravulizumab IV was included, to more clearly reflect the patient 
population in the aHUS indication (i.e. ‘adult and paediatric’ patients), and the reference to section 5.1 
was deleted, also in line with the approach taken for recently approved medicinal products.  
The finally approved indications is  
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH): 
- 
- 
in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity. 
in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least 
the past 6 months  
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome 
(aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have received eculizumab for at least 3 
months and have evidence of response to eculizumab 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy  
An indication in the paediatric patient population has not been requested. No efficacy and safety data 
are available with this new formulation and administration device in paediatric patients. This 
formulation should not be used in paediatric patients.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 met its primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority of ravulizumab 
SC versus ravulizumab IV in terms of PK. From an efficacy point of view, results appear similar 
between both formulations.

The overall safety evaluation is based on the pivotal study ALXN1210-PNH-303 and a comparison of 
data obtained through the 52-weeks data cutoff of ravulizumab SC treatment in 
Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 (hereafter referred to as SC group) versus pooled data from 52-weeks data 
cutoffs on ravulizumab IV treatment in 2 Phase 3 studies (ALXN1210-PNH-301 and 
ALXN1210-PNH-302, hereafter referred to as pooled IV group).  
The ISS Safety Analysis Set that is used for the safety evaluation is defined as all patients who either 
received at least one dose of ravulizumab SC in the SC Treated Safety Analysis Set of Study 
ALXN1210-PNH-303 (excluding 7 patients from 1 site due to important source documentation 
deviations and site noncompliance) or received at least one dose of ravulizumab IV in the Safety Set of 
Study ALXN1210-PNH-301 or Study ALXN1210-PNH-302. 
Safety data from the 52-weeks data cutoff from Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 were also provided as 
supportive. 
The 52-week data cutoff date applies to the last patient enrolled and all data available through the 
specific cutoff dates for each Phase 3 PNH and aHUS study are included 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
ALXN1210-PNH-303 
Randomized treatment period 
All 45 patients in the IV group received the correct weight-based ravulizumab IV loading dose on Day 1 
and maintenance dose on Day 15. The 84 patients in the SC group attempted a total of 672 SC dose 
administrations in the following locations: abdomen (n = 628), thigh (n = 425), and upper arm with 
help (n = 299). 
One patient (IV group) had 2 infusion interruptions on Day 1 and Day 15, and 1 patient (SC group) 
had an IV loading dose infusion interruption on Day 1; all 3 infusions were interrupted to replace the 
micron filter and were restarted. None of the IV infusion interruptions were due to AEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 78/119 
 
 
 
 
It was noted that 1 patient missed the planned SC dose at Day 43 during the Randomized Treatment 
Period, but this patient actually received their SC dose on Day 42 which was recorded as an 
unscheduled visit; the patient had been hospitalized for an SAE of gastroenteritis on Day 40 that 
resolved on Day 43. 
All 7 patients who were excluded from the Safety Analysis Set received all planned doses per the 
protocol during the Randomized Treatment Period. 
During the Randomized Treatment Period, treatment compliance was 100% in the IV group and 98.8% 
in the SC group. 
SC Treatment  
While patients in both treatment groups received SC administration of ravulizumab during the 
Extension Period, patients randomized to the SC group also received 56 days of SC treatment during 
the Randomized Treatment Period (referred to as the SC/SC group). Patients randomized to receive 
ravulizumab IV during the Randomized Treatment Period had their first dose of ravulizumab SC at the 
start of the Extension Period (Day 71) (referred to as the IV/SC group). 
As of the data cut-off date (02 Feb 2021), the mean duration of SC treatment was 486.4 days (range 
37 to 709 days) and the maximum exposure to SC treatment was 709 days (Table below). The longer 
mean exposure in the SC/SC group reflects the 8-week IV dose regimen received by the IV/SC group 
during the Randomized Treatment Period. 
Overall, the 128 patients in the SC Treated Safety Analysis Set had a total of 8,464 SC dose 
administration attempts and patients received the full dose in 99.9% of these dosing attempts. 
The median total infusion time per site administration was 10 minutes.

treatment safety analysis set)
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023

Overall, the majority (90.6%) of patients had 100% treatment compliance since first SC treatment; 11 
(8.6%) patients had ≥ 90% to < 100% treatment compliance; and 1 patient (SC group) had ≥ 70% to 
< 80% treatment compliance due to interruption of study treatment during hospitalization for bone 
marrow transplant. 
Reasons for missed doses were collected for all doses administered at the study site and were not 
documented for home administration. Seven (5.5%) patients missed a planned SC dose at 11 time 
points during study drug administration performed at the site. 
Three patients did not have reasons recorded for missed doses and 4 patients had reasons listed as 
“Other” (1 due to patient issues, 1 due to early termination [ET], 1 due to dosing received the prior 
day at home, and 1 patient missed 5 doses due to hospitalization and subsequently withdrew from the 
study). None of missed doses were due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Randomized Treatment Period  
During the 10-week Randomized Treatment in Study ALXN1210-PNH-303, the percentage of patients 
who experienced AEs was 60.0% in the IV group and 79.8% in the SC group.  
When ADEs are excluded, the AE incidence was similar (IV group: 60.0%; SC group: 64.3%). The 
most commonly reported AE was headache (IV group: 8.9%; SC group: 13.1%).  
Infusion reactions were experienced by 8 (17.8%) patients in the IV group and 38 (45.2%) patients in 
the SC group. Unrelated SAEs of neutropenia, lens dislocation, gastroenteritis, cervicobrachial 
syndrome, and urinary retention were reported by 1 patient each in the SC group, and cholecystitis 
was reported in the IV group.

SC treatment  
Through the 52-week data cut-off dates, the overall AE profiles were similar in the SC and the pooled 
IV groups, with similar rate of deaths and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug.  
No meningococcal infections were reported in either group.  
Excluding AEs and serious adverse events, (SAEs) related to COVID-19, the percentage of patients 
with AEs and SAEs were similar in both SC and pooled IV groups.

SC treatment period 
Among the most frequently reported TEAEs (SC vs pooled IV group; at least 10% incidence in any 
group) of headache (14.1% vs 23.2%), pyrexia (10.9% vs 8.9%), and nasopharyngitis (9.4% vs 
14.2%), incidences of headache and nasopharyngitis, were less frequent in the SC group than in the 
pooled IV group.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs decreased over time through the 52-week data cut-off date in 
both groups. 
The incidence of Preferred Terms (PT) were balanced between the SC and pooled IV groups, except for 
COVID-19 infection-related AEs that were reported only in the SC group (a total of 23 patients). Given 
that Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the possibility of 
patients testing positive for COVID-19 was expected in the SC group as compared to the pooled IV 
group; in the pooled IV group, patients were treated in the PNH IV studies prior to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
Incidences of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) were lower in the SC group (18.8%) than in the 
pooled IV group (35.8%). 
Among TEAEs (SC vs pooled IV group) assessed by the Investigator as related to study drug 
administration across both groups, headache (3.9% vs 10.1%), erythema (3.9% vs 0.2%), and 
nausea (0.8% vs 2.5%) were the most frequently reported. Despite the numerical differences in 
related TEAEs, the type of related TEAEs were similar and consistent with the known safety profile of 
ravulizumab. 
Analysis of TEAEs by worst severity showed that most patients in both groups had Grade 1 or 2 
severity AEs. In general, there was no evidence of increased severity of AEs in the SC group compared 
to the pooled IV group.

2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred during the Randomized Treatment Period. In the SC group, 1 patient died on Day 
182 due to COVID-19; this event was assessed by the Investigator to be not related to the study drug.  
In the pooled IV group, 2 patients died through the 52-week data cut-off date, both assessed by the 
Investigator as not related to the study drug (ALXN1210-PNH-301 52-week data)  
•  One patient died due to lung adenocarcinoma during the Extension Period following symptoms 
of lung cancer (blood-tinged sputum, cough, and wheezing) that developed during the Primary 
Evaluation Period.

•  One patient died due to pulmonary sepsis during the Extension Period. 
Other Serious Adverse Events  
Randomised treatment period 
Six patients experienced an SAE during the Randomized Treatment Period; 1 patient in the 
ravulizumab IV group experienced an SAE of cholecystitis and 5 patients in the ravulizumab SC group 
experienced SAEs of neutropenia, lens dislocation, gastroenteritis, cervicobrachial syndrome, and 
urinary retention. One patient (SC group) from the excluded site had an SAE of extravascular 
haemolysis. None of the SAEs were considered related to study treatment, and all events resolved. 
SC treatment period 
The percentage of patients with SAEs, excluding those related to COVID-19, was similar in both 
groups.  
A total of 8 patients had COVID-19-related SAEs in the SC group: 6 patients had COVID-19, 1 patient 
had suspected COVID-19, and 1 patient had COVID-19 pneumonia. All SAEs related to COVID-19 were 
assessed as unrelated to the study drug by the Investigator. Based on the mechanism of action of 
ravulizumab, it does not appear that patients receiving ravulizumab treatment are at increased risk of 
developing COVID-19 infection. 
The most frequently reported SAE across both groups was pyrexia (2 patients [1.6%] in SC vs 5 
patients [1.1%] in pooled IV group). Other SAEs reported in at least 2 patients in either group were 
anaemia, haemolysis, aplastic anaemia, influenza, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, and uterine 
leiomyoma; all other SAEs were reported in no more than 1 patient in either group. 
The rate of study drug discontinuation (SC vs pooled IV group) due to SAEs was low (0 vs 2 SAEs in 2 
patients).

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) included infusion reactions, meningococcal infections, other 
serious infections, and antidrug antibodies. 
Randomised treatment period 
Local (infusion site or injection site reactions), systemic (infusion-associated/infusion-related 
reactions), and immune-mediated reactions were evaluated during the Randomized Treatment Period. 
Eight (17.8%) patients in the IV group and 38 (45.2%) patients in the SC group experienced   infusion 
reactions during the Randomized Treatment Period. In the SC group, 30 (35.7%) patients experienced 
infusion reactions coded to the SOC of General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions under 
Preferred Terms such as injection site erythema, injection site reaction, fatigue, and medical device 
site erythema. Two events of drug hypersensitivity (both Grade 2 severity) were experienced by 1 
patient, and 1 event of hypersensitivity (Grade 2) was experienced by another patient; both of these 
patients were ADA negative. An additional patient had an event coded as medical device site erythema 
(verbatim “sensitivity to device adhesive [mild erythema]”). 
No meningococcal infections were reported during the Randomized Treatment Period and no patients 
developed antidrug antibodies. 
SC treatment period 
The exposure-adjusted rates of infusion reactions (excluding ADEs) was 98.3 and 54.1 in the SC and 
pooled IV groups, respectively (Table below). The difference in the rates of infusion reactions between 
the SC and pooled IV groups are attributable to local infusion reactions (ie, injection site reactions) 
related to the SC mode of administration. It is important to note that the infusion reactions for 
ravulizumab SC administered via on-body injector (OBI) were defined and assessed differently from 
that of ravulizumab IV administration. Infusion reactions for ravulizumab IV included systemic 
reactions. Infusion reactions, for ravulizumab SC administered via OBI, included local reactions (which 
are injection site reactions localized to the site of SC administration) as well as systemic reactions. 
In addition, COVID-19 related AESI was reported only in the SC group, which is a result of the pre-
pandemic timing of the Studies ALXN1210-PNH-301 and ALXN1210-PNH-302. Otherwise, the rate of 
serious infections was consistent between the SC and pooled IV groups. 
There were no meningococcal infections and no antidrug antibody (ADA)-positive results in Study 
ALXN1210-PNH-303. 
The rates of infusion reactions decreased over time through the 52-week data cut-off date in both 
groups.

Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 91/119 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported SOCs (SC vs pooled IV group) included infections and infestations 
(26.6% vs 28.2%), general disorders and administrative site conditions (21.9% vs 18.3%), nervous 
system disorders (18.8% vs 26.6%), and gastrointestinal disorders (16.4% vs 19.5%). 
Adverse Device Effects of Ravulizumab SC 
Adverse device effects specific to ravulizumab SC in Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 are not included in 
analysis of AEs, although an overview is presented in this section: 
Aside from ADEs associated with the SC route of administration, there were no other notable 
differences between ravulizumab SC and ravulizumab IV.  
Local administration site reactions coded to the SOC of General Disorders and Administration Site 
Conditions were reported by 21.9% of patients.  
The most frequently reported local administration site reactions (in > 3% of patients) included 
injection site reaction (4.7%), medical device site erythema (3.9%), infusion site erythema (3.1%), 
and injection site erythema (3.1%). Two patients experienced systemic reactions considered related to 
the study device (1 patient had procedural dizziness and 1 patient had a serious ADE of procedural 
hypotension).  
Of the patients experiencing local administration site reactions, 2 (1.6%) patients had Grade 2 events, 
and 1 (0.8%) patient had a Grade 3 event (application site induration); all other events were Grade 1.  
The incidence of local administration site reactions decreased over time (0 to 6 months: 197.4 
E/100PY, > 6 to 12 months: 13.2 E/100PY). One or more ADEs relating to drug delivery (ie, no drug or 
less than full volume of the device administered; coded to the SOC of Product Issues) were reported 
for 91 (71.1%) patients.  
The incidence of these ADEs decreased over time (0 to 6 months: 192.6 E/ 100 PY, > 6 to 12 months: 
152.0 E/ 100 PY).  
Although many patients had at least 1 ADE relating to drug delivery, full dose (490 mg) administration 
was achieved in 99.9% of ravulizumab SC administration attempts administered as patients were 
permitted to use more than 2 devices as needed.  
The majority (97.6%) of full doses were administered per protocol using 2 OBDS device kits; few doses 
(2.4%) used more than 2 OBDS kits.

Device performance 
Full dose administration was achieved in 99.9% (8459/8464) of ravulizumab SC administration 
attempts. The majority (97.6%) of full doses (490 mg) were administered using 2 OBDS kits per the 
instructions for use.  
A total of 17,165 devices were used during the course of the study. Full volume per device was 
delivered by 98.6% of the devices used during study (ie, 16,926 out of 17,165 devices).

Of the 17,165 devices attempted (roughly 134 devices per patient), complaints were reported for 298 
(1.7%) devices. The root cause of approximately half (163/298) of the reported complaints was use 
error, 21 were due to confirmed technical defects, 28 were due to unknown defects, 65 were unable to 
be analysed since the device was not returned, and 21 had an ongoing investigation at the time of the 
data cutoff date.

Table 40 Device Complaints for the On Body Delivery System Since First SC Dose as of Data 
Cutoff Date (SC Treated Safety Analysis Set) 
Notes: A confirmed technical defect refers to any confirmed device defect or malfunction not attributed to use error, 
whether or not dose delivery was affected. Use error refers to user action/lack of user action while using the device 
that leads to a different result than intended by the manufacturer or expected by the user. Other/unknown defect 
refers to everything else other than confirmed device defect or a use error. The source data for the reported 
complaints, confirmed technical defects, use errors, and other/unknown defects are the Investigations Department 
device complaints dataset. Total number of devices attempted is based on the data recorded on the ravulizumab SC 
administration CRF. a Denominator = total number of devices attempted. b N/A = no device was returned; unable 
to analyse. c Unknown = device was returned and the Investigations Department could not find a defect.

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Pooled data analyses of laboratory parameters in the Pooled IV group were performed for data 
obtained during the Extension Period only when all patients were treated with ravulizumab. Due to the 
differences in patient population (treatment-naïve and eculizumab experienced) in Studies ALXN1210-
PNH-301 and ALXN1210-PNH-302 during the Randomized Treatment Period (through Day 183) data 
are presented by individual studies. 
There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters across the Phase 3 PNH studies 
that were of safety concern.

N/A 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors  
Safety data analysed by intrinsic factors (age, sex, body weight, geographic region, and race) for the 
SC and pooled IV groups were presented. 
Regarding subgroups, some of the subgroup categories (age > 65 years; body weight ≥ 100 kg; 
geographic regions of North America, Latin America, and Asia Pacific; racial groups of Black or African 
American and Other/Unknown) are represented by patient numbers too small to make any meaningful 
interpretation in the SC group.  
With the consideration of these limitations, the subgroup analysis of the safety profile identified no 
sensitive subgroups that were considered to have an influence on the overall safety profile of 
ravulizumab SC treatment. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Safety analyses by extrinsic factors were not performed. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Ravulizumab has not been studied in pregnant or lactating females. 
In the SC group, 1 patient became pregnant during the Extension Period and had an elective abortion 
before informing site staff; the patient continued to remain on study treatment. 
In the pooled IV group, 1 patient became pregnant (reported on Day 328). The patient delivered a 
healthy baby via ‘Caesarean’ section, with no complications.

2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity 
Patients with PNH No treatment-emergent ADA-positive findings were observed after ravulizumab SC 
administration in any patient. This low ADA incidence rate is consistent with the low rates observed 
following ravulizumab IV treatment. As such, no impact of immunogenicity on safety was observed 
with SC administration. 
In the pooled IV group, 1 patient had treatment-emergent positive ADA-positive finding through the 
52-week data cutoff date (ALXN1210-PNH-301 52-week data). The ADA response was transient, with 
low titer and not positive for eculizumab cross reactivity. There were no neutralizing ADAs.

2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with ravulizumab SC. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The rate of study drug discontinuation due to AEs by patients was low in both SC and pooled IV 
groups:  
•  One patient in the SC group discontinued study drug on Day 85 due to a non-serious AE of 
depression that began on Day 72 and subsequently withdrew from study on Day 85. The event 
was not considered to be related to the study drug by the Investigator.  
• 
Two patients in the pooled IV group discontinued study drug during the Extension Period (lung 
adenocarcinoma and myelodysplastic syndrome) through the 52-week data cut-off date in the 
pooled IV group (ALXN1210-PNH-301 52-week data). Both AEs were assessed by the 
Investigator as not related to the study drug. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
The estimated post-marketing exposure to ravulizumab IV since the first Marketing Authorization (21 
Dec 2018) through 30 Jun 2021 was 3996.7 patient-years (PY) for the PNH and aHUS indications. 
Meningococcal infection remains an important identified risk for ravulizumab IV based on the 
mechanism of action, findings from ravulizumab clinical studies, and long-term experience with 
eculizumab. 
Three patients reported meningococcal infection in the postmarketing setting of ravulizumab IV (2 
patients with serotype non-typeable and 1 patient with unknown serotype) with a reporting rate of 
approximately 0.08 per 100 PY [3 patients/3997 PY], between 197 to 322 days of the first dose of 
ravulizumab IV for PNH. This is within the rate observed in ravulizumab IV clinical studies (consistent 
with the overall meningococcal rate of 0.3 per 100 PY with eculizumab) and within the postmarketing 
meningococcal rate observed on eculizumab treatment. Administration of a meningococcal vaccination 
at least 2 weeks prior to the administration of ravulizumab IV was confirmed in all 3 patients. 
Long-term post-marketing experience with eculizumab showed a consistent reporting rate of 
meningococcal infections in eculizumab-treated patients over the past 10 years at approximately 0.3 to 
0.5 per 100 PY with the reporting rate for fatal outcomes at 0.03 per 100 PY representing 9.2% of 
patients who experienced meningococcal infections. This is similar to the proportion of fatal events in 
the general population (10% to 15%). 
The understanding and characterization of this risk remain unchanged based on the cumulative data as 
of 30 Jun 2021. Mitigation measures of the risk of meningococcal infections remain appropriate and 
effective. 
A signal of hypersensitivity reactions was confirmed based on cumulative data review of the Standard 
MedDRA Query (SMQ) hypersensitivity. The signal of hypersensitivity reactions was confirmed as an 
identified risk. It is not considered an important risk because hypersensitivity reaction including 
anaphylaxis is a well-documented and well-characterized reaction associated with therapeutic proteins 
including monoclonal antibodies.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall safety assessment is based on study ALXN1210 PNH 303 (including the Randomised 
Treatment Period and the Extension Period up to week 52) and a comparison of data obtained through 
the 52-weeks data cut-off (2 Feb 2021) of ravulizumab SC treatment in Study ALXN1210 PNH 303 
(hereafter referred to as SC group) versus pooled data from 52-weeks data cut-offs on ravulizumab IV 
treatment in 2 Phase 3 studies (ALXN1210 PNH 301 and ALXN1210 PNH 302, hereafter referred to as 
pooled IV group). Safety is further supported by data from the 52-weeks data cut-off from Study 
ALXN1210 aHUS 311. The safety dataset is comprised by 129 patients treated with ravulizumab in 
study ALXN1210 PNH 303, 45 initially randomised to the IV arm and 84 to the SC arm during the 
Randomised Treatment Period. Of these, 128 patients received at least one dose of ravulizumab SC 
and represent the main safety dataset (SC Treated Safety Analysis Set).  
Overall, demographic and baseline characteristics appear broadly balanced between the SC and pooled 
IV groups and were as expected based on the eligibility criteria in each study, except for race and body 
weight categories.  
Regarding the main Phase 3 Study ALXN1210-PNH-303 of ravulizumab SC OBDS in adult patients 
with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) (N= 128; IV/SC: 44 SC/SC:84), all patients in the 
IV group received the corresponding weight-based ravulizumab IV loading dose on Day 1 and 
maintenance dose on Day 15The 84 patients in the SC group attempted a total of 672 SC dose 
administrations. During the Randomized Treatment Period, treatment compliance was 100% in the IV 
group and 98.8% in the SC group.  
A flat dose is proposed for the administration of ravulizumab SC and according to the PK results of the 
ALXN1210 PNH 303 study, a higher exposure could be expected with ravulizumab SC at the proposed 
dosing regimen compared with ravulizumab IV (see PK/PD section). In this regard, safety data 
according to weight (≥ 40 kg to < 60 kg; ≥ 60 kg to < 100 kg) have been provided. Of note, the 
proportion of patients with TESAEs and TEAEs of Grade 4 was higher in the subgroup of patients with a 
lower weight although information on TESAEs and TEAEs of Grade 4 by weight did not show relevant 
issues. 
Overall, the 128 patients in the SC Treated Safety Analysis Set had a total of 8,464 SC dose 
administration attempts and patients received the full dose in 99.9% of these dosing attempts, what is 
considered adequate. The median total infusion time per site administration was 10 minutes. 
Regarding the main Phase 3 study ALXN1210-PNH-303, during the 10-week Randomized 
Treatment Period, the percentage of patients who experienced AEs was 60.0% in the IV group and 
79.8% in the SC group. This difference appears to be driven mostly by the SOCs “General disorders 
and administration site conditions” (1 [2.2] ravulizumab IV vs. 33 [39.3%] ravulizumab SC) and 
“Product issues” (0 vs. 21 [25.0%], respectively), mainly device delivery system issue (13 patients) 
and incorrect dose administered device (10 patients). According to the MAH, when adverse device 
effects (ADEs) are excluded, the percentage of patients who experienced AEs was similar between the 
treatment groups (IV group: 60.0%; SC group: 64.3%). The most common AE was headache, which 
was reported by 8.9% of patients in the IV group and 13.1% of patients in the SC group. Of note, a 
higher incidence of diarrhoea was observed in the ravulizumab SC arm compared with the IV (11 
[13.1%] vs 2 [4.4%]). Further, psychiatric disorders were reported in 6 (7.1%) patients in the 
ravulizumab SC arm while none in the IV arm. Psychiatric disorders included depression, insomnia (2 
each), anxiety and daydreaming (1 each). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 5 (6.0%) 
patients in the ravulizumab SC arm vs 1 (2.2%) in the ravulizumab IV. None of these SAE was 
reported in more than one patient. SAEs reported included neutropenia, lens dislocation, 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 101/119 
 
 
 
gastroenteritis, cervico-brachial syndrome, and urinary retention, reported by 1 patient each in the SC 
group, and cholecystitis was reported by 1 patient in the IV group.   
Considering the SC group (n=128), after excluding AEs and SAEs related to COVID-19, the percentage 
of patients with AEs and SAEs were similar in both SC and pooled IV groups.  
During SC Treatment as of data cut-off date, the most common AEs (reported by ≥ 10% of patients) 
were headache (14.1%), COVID-19 (14.1%), and pyrexia (10.9%).  
Among TEAEs (SC vs. pooled IV group) assessed by the Investigator as related to study drug 
administration across both groups, headache (3.9% vs. 10.1%), erythema (3.9% vs. 0.2%), and 
nausea (0.8% vs. 2.5%) were the most frequently reported. Despite the numerical differences in 
related TEAEs, the type of related TEAEs were similar and consistent with the known safety profile of 
ravulizumab, and no relevant differences were shown between IV and SC ravulizumab. Additionally, 
analysis of TEAEs by worst severity showed that most patients in both groups had Grade 1 or 2 
severity AEs. In general, there was no evidence of increased severity of AEs in the SC group compared 
to the pooled IV group. Asthenia was reported to be higher in the SC group compared to the poled IV 
group (SC 12/128 [9.4%] vs. IV 5/436 [1.1 %]), however a thorough review of the individual cases of 
asthenia did not reveal any safety concerns, being asthenia a very common symptom in PNH disease 
patients. As reported by the MAH, over long-term exposure as of Week 108 (2 year) for Study 
ALXN1210-PNH 303, there was a decreasing trend in the event rate of asthenia from 8.9 events per 
100 patient-years for 0-12 months to 4.3 events per 100 patient years for the > 12 - 24 month time 
frame. 
In study ALXN1210-PNH-303, SAEs were reported for 26 (20.3%) patients during SC treatment, 
including 8 patients with COVID-19 related SAEs (1 of them fatal, assessed as unrelated to study 
drug). One patient had 2 serious ADEs of application site induration and procedural hypotension 
assessed as related to the study device. One patient withdrew from study treatment due to an AE of 
depression (not related to study treatment). No meningococcal infections or MAVEs were reported.  
In the pooled IV group, 2 patients died through the 52-week data cut-off date, both assessed by the 
Investigator as not related to the study drug (ALXN1210-PNH-301 52-week data).  
The rate of study drug discontinuation (SC vs. pooled IV group) due to SAEs was low (0 vs. 2 SAEs in 2 
patients). 
Local administration site reactions were reported by 28 (21.9%) patients (2 patients had Grade 2 
events, 1 patient had a Grade 3 event, and all other events were Grade 1). The most frequently 
reported local administration site reactions (>3% of patients) included injection site reaction (4.7%), 
medical device site erythema (3.9%), infusion site erythema (3.1%), and injection site erythema 
(3.1%). The incidence of local administration site reactions decreased over time (0 to 6 months: 197.4 
events per 100 patient-years (E/100PY), >6 to 12 months: 13.2 E/100PY).  
The rates of infusion reactions decreased over time through the 52-week data cut-off date in both 
groups. Of note, there were no meningococcal infections and no antidrug antibody (ADA)-positive 
results in Study ALXN1210-PNH-303. 
During the procedure, long-term safety data up to Week 108 (data cut-off of 2 March 2022) have been 
provided. Overall, the safety profile of ravulizumab SC appears in line with the previously reported 
data although there was an increase in the overall incidence of SAEs and TEAEs of Grade 3 compared 
with the previous data cut-off. The incidence of some TEAEs was also higher (i.e. blood and lymphatic 
system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations and pyrexia, among others), 
although this is not unexpected taking into account the longer treatment exposure. Notwithstanding, 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 102/119 
 
 
 
the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, ADEs and AEs of special interest seems to decrease over time. No 
additional relevant issues were identified.  
With regards to de device performance, in 99.9% of cases, full dose administration was achieved. The 
majority (97.6%) of full doses (490 mg) were administered using 2 OBDS kits. There were also 202 
administrations in which >2 kits were required for a full dose. Of the 17,165 devices attempted, 
complaints were reported for 298 (1.7%) devices. Of these, 21 were due to confirmed technical 
defects, 28 were due to unknown defects, 163 due to a use error and 114 due to other/unknown 
defects (65 were unable to be analysed since the device was not returned, and 21 had an ongoing 
investigation).  
The fact that 2 kits (or more) are required to administer a full dose increases the complexity of the 
procedure albeit the generation of notable waste materials. During a scientific advice requested by the 
MAH in 2018 the possibility of developing a ready-to-use integral drug-device combination (DDC) was 
discussed. However, during the presubmission meeting prior to submission of this applications 
procedure the MAH stated that their intent has always been to develop ravulizumab SC as non-integral 
DDC.  
Of note, according to the MAH, the injector of ravulizumab SC uses acrylic adhesive and therefore, for 
patients with a known allergy to acrylics adhesive, use of this product may result in an allergic 
reaction. A warning has been included in section 4.4. of the SmPC. Premedication can be considered 
and/or supportive measures should be instituted if signs of allergy appear. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials  have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile for ravulizumab SC, administered at a weekly flat dose of 490 mg, appears generally 
consistent with the well-characterized safety profile for ravulizumab IV. The SC formulation is 
associated with a higher incidence of administration site adverse events and adverse device effects, 
although most of them were mild.  
No new clinically relevant safety concerns were identified for ravulizumab SC.

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ultomiris (ravulizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH is submitting a Marketing Authorisation Extension Application for the addition of a new 
strength (245 mg solution for injection) and route of administration (subcutaneous use) for Ultomiris 
(ravulizumab) for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) or 
atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). 
The following indications have been agreed: 
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH): 
• 
• 
in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity. 
in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least 
the past 6 months. 
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome 
(aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have received eculizumab for at least 3 
months and have evidence of response to eculizumab. 
The SC formulation is a drug-device combination product comprised of a prefilled cartridge (PFC) 
containing 245mg of ravulizumab co-packaged with a single-use on-body injector. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The first treatment for PNH, eculizumab (Soliris), was approved in 2007 in the EU. Eculizumab is a 
selective, humanized mAb that specifically targets C5 of the terminal complement cascade, inhibiting 
its cleavage during complement activation into C5a and C5b. Prior to the introduction of eculizumab, 
the treatment of PNH was mainly supportive, aiming to control the clinical manifestations of the 
disease (management of haemolysis, anaemia, thrombophilia, and bone marrow failure). This 
supportive treatment included blood transfusion, administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, 
corticosteroids, or anabolic steroids, iron therapy, thrombosis prophylaxis, and thrombolytic therapy. 
Although the only available curative approach for PNH is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT), it is not recommended as upfront therapy in the eculizumab era given the 
risks of transplant-related morbidity and mortality. HSCT is a reasonable therapeutic option in patients 
who do not respond to therapy with eculizumab or those patients who have severe pancytopenia due 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 109/119 
 
 
 
to underlying bone marrow failure. The transplant paradigm pursued is often with reduced-intensity 
conditioning regimens, as myeloablation is not required to eradicate the PNH clone.  
When eculizumab was approved for aHUS in 2011, it was the first treatment approved for life-
threatening complement-mediated TMA events. Prior to eculizumab, treatment of aHUS was limited to 
plasma therapy, and since its approval, patients with aHUS are probably no longer treated with long-
term plasma therapy, which can transiently maintain normal levels of hematologic measures while the 
underlying complement dysregulation and thrombotic microangiopathic processes likely persist (Loirat, 
2010).  
Ravulizumab IV was approved in 2019 for PNH and in 2020 for aHUS, with a more convenient 
administration schedule. A subcutaneous administration (ravulizumab SC, 70 mg/mL) has been 
developed to provide an alternative route of administration for adult patients with PNH or aHUS, in 
which a chronic treatment is expected. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical study to support efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics is the pivotal 
ALXN1210-PNH-303 study, a phase 3, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, open-label, 
pharmacokinetic, non-inferiority study of ravulizumab sc versus iv in 129 adult patients with PNH 
currently treated with eculizumab. 
This study was also designed to assess the performance of the ravulizumab on body delivery system 
(OBDS) drug/device product. 
The study consists of an up to a 30-day screening period, a 10-week randomized treatment period, 
and an extension period of up to 172 weeks or until the product is registered or approved, whichever 
occurred first. Data provided are based on the randomised treatment period and the extension period 
up to 52 weeks. 
Patients were stratified by weight group (≥40 kg to <60 kg and ≥60 kg to <100 kg) and then 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ravulizumab SC or ravulizumab IV. 
Additionally, two supportive Phase 1 PK and safety studies in healthy adult subjects (Studies 
ALXN1210-HV-105 (N=49) and ALXN1210-SC-101 (N=105)) fulfil the clinical program of Ultomiris sc. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary endpoint 
At the end of the Randomized Treatment Period (Day 71), the mean (percent coefficient of variation) 
Ctrough was 457.58 (23.7%) µg/mL in the IV group and 578.70 (24.3%) µg/mL in the SC group. The 
geometric least squares mean (LSM) ratio was 1.257 (90% CI: 1.160, 1.361) on Day 71. 
Secondary endpoints 
During the Randomized Treatment Period (through Day 71), efficacy endpoints remained stable in both 
the IV and SC groups. 
•  Mean percent change in LDH from Baseline to Day 71 was 2.57% for the SC group and 5.73% for 
the IV group. 
•  Breakthrough haemolysis (BTH) event incidence was low and similar between treatment groups (1 
patient in each group). 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 110/119 
 
 
 
A similar proportion of patients in each treatment group achieved transfusion avoidance (IV group: 
86.7%; SC group: 94.0%) and stabilized haemoglobin (IV group: 81.8%; SC group: 93.6%). 
Efficacy endpoints remained stable over time through 1 year of ravulizumab SC treatment in both the 
SC/SC group as well as the IV/SC group. 
• 
LDH levels were maintained over time in both treatment groups. Mean percent change from 
Baseline to SC Day 351 in LDH was 0.9% (IV/SC group: -0.83%; SC/SC group: 1.7%). 
•  BTH events were infrequent: 5/128 (3.9%) (IV/SC group: 2 events; SC/SC group: 3 events). None 
were free complement component 5 (C5)-related. 
• 
Transfusion avoidance was maintained in 83.6% of patients (IV/SC group: 79.5%; SC/SC group: 
85.7%). 
•  Haemoglobin stabilization was achieved by 79.7% of patients (IV/SC group: 72.7%; SC/SC group: 
83.5%). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no critical limiting uncertainties regarding the efficacy results. The reported data seem to be 
consistent with the data from the IV formulation. As previously described, efficacy endpoints remained 
stable over time through 1 year of ravulizumab SC treatment in both the SC/SC group as well as the 
IV/SC group, what can be a prove that patients can switch from ravulizumab IV to ravulizumab SC 
without loss of efficacy. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
During the 10-week randomized treatment period: 
−  The percentage of patients who experienced AEs was 60% in the IV group and 79.8% in the SC 
group. When adverse device effects (ADEs) are excluded, the percentage of patients who 
experienced AEs was similar between the treatment groups (IV group: 60%; SC group: 64.3%). 
−  The most common AE was headache, which was reported by 8.9% of patients in the IV group and 
13.1% of patients in the SC group. 
−  Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 5 (6.0%) patients in the ravulizumab SC arm vs 1 
(2.2%) in the ravulizumab IV. Unrelated SAEs of neutropenia, lens dislocation, gastroenteritis, 
cervicobrachial syndrome, and urinary retention were reported by 1 patient each in the SC group, 
and cholecystitis was reported by 1 patient in the IV group. 
No patients had AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment during the randomized treatment 
period. 
During SC treatment as of data cut-off date: 
−  The most common AEs (reported by ≥ 10% of patients) were headache (14.1%), COVID-19 
(14.1%), and pyrexia (10.9%).  
−  SAEs were reported for 27 (21.1%) patients, including 8 patients with COVID-19 related SAEs (1 
fatal, assessed as unrelated to study drug). One patient had 2 serious ADEs of application site 
induration and procedural hypotension assessed as related to the study device. One patient 
withdrew from study treatment due to an AE of depression (not related to study treatment).  
−  No meningococcal infections or MAVEs were reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023  
Page 111/119 
 
 
 
− 
Local administration site reactions were reported by 28 (21.9%) patients (2 patients had Grade 2 
events, 1 patient had a Grade 3 event, and all other events were Grade 1). 
•  The most frequently reported local administration site reactions (> 3% of patients) 
included injection site reaction (4.7%), medical device site erythema (3.9%), infusion site 
erythema (3.1%), and injection site erythema (3.1%). 
•  The incidence of local administration site reactions decreased over time (0 to 6 months: 
197.4 events per 100 patient-years (E/100PY), > 6 to 12 months: 13.2 E/100PY). 
No deaths were reported related to the study drug. 
All trends reported above, have been confirmed with the updated data from the 2 years data cut-off. 
No additional safety signals have been identified. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The SC formulation is associated with a higher incidence of administration site adverse events and 
adverse device effects.  
A flat dose is proposed for the administration of ravulizumab SC and according to the PK results of the 
ALXN1210 PNH 303 study, a higher exposure could be expected with ravulizumab SC compared with 
ravulizumab IV. Safety data according to weight showed a higher incidence of TESAEs and TEAEs of 
Grade 4 in the subgroup of patients with the lowest weight (i.e. ≥ 40 kg to < 60 kg). Further 
information on TESAEs and TEAEs of Grade 4 should be provided. 
The ravulizumab SC formulation is administered by means of a device, a single-use on-body injector. 
For a full dose (i.e. 490 mg) 2 injectors/kits (or more) are required. This increases the complexity of 
the administration procedure albeit the generation of notable waste materials.

Randomized Treatment Period: 
During the Randomized Treatment Period, following both treatments, all individual serum ravulizumab concentrations 
were >175 µg/mL, the previously established PK threshold for achieving and sustaining complete terminal complement 
inhibition. 
Immediate and complete inhibition of terminal complement free C5 (free C5 concentrations <0.5 µg/mL) was observed 
in all patients at all times during the Randomized Treatment Period for both treatment groups.  
SC Treated Period: 
A fixed weekly SC maintenance regimen achieved Ctrough levels above the previously established free C5-based PK 
threshold (175 µg/mL) in all patients through 1 year of SC treatment.  
All individual serum free C5 concentrations obtained after first dose of ravulizumab SC in all patients were <0.5 μg/mL,

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Based on the results of study ALXN1210-PNH-303 non-inferiority of ravulizumab SC versus 
ravulizumab IV can be considered demonstrated in primary (PK) and secondary endpoints (efficacy) 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023

and there is good concordance among the different efficacy endpoints. Of note, ravulizumab exposure 
appears to be higher when administered subcutaneously at the recommended flat dose compared with 
the IV administration.  
Considering these results and the non-inferiority design ravulizumab SC offers an alternative option to 
patients with the added potential advantage of a more convenient and easier self-administration route 
as compared to the IV. 
From a safety point of view, no major differences have been observed in the safety profile of 
ravulizumab SC compared to ravulizumab IV, apart from a higher incidence of adverse events related 
to the administration and drug device.  
The MAH has applied for an indication in adults with PNH and aHUS, including both patients of newly 
diagnosis and patients previously treated with eculizumab. Data from the SC Phase 3 study in patients 
with PNH is intended to be used to extrapolate to the aHUS indication. Extrapolation of data to the 
aHUS indication and treatment naïve patients appears acceptable (see PK/PD section). However, since 
extrapolation is mainly based on data generated with ravulizumab IV and results of study ALXN1210-
PNH-303, in which ravulizumab SC was compared with ravulizumab IV, the indication for the SC 
formulation was requested to be aligned with that of the IV formulation, since no further 
efficacy/safety data have been provided as part of this submission.  
Further, since the PI of ravulizumab IV is being updated as part of this procedure to align it with the PI 
of the SC formulation, a minor change in the wording of the indication was proposed to more clearly 
reflect the patient population covered by the aHUS indication. Further, the cross-reference to section 
5.1 has been deleted. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Non-inferiority of ravulizumab SC to ravulizumab IV has been demonstrated in the current phase 3 trial 
in eculizumab pre-treated patients with PNH. The safety profile appears in line with the already known 
for ravulizumab IV although a higher incidence of AEs related to the administration were observed with 
the SC formulation, but overall mild and manageable. The SC formulation may offer an alternative 
route for patients.  
It is considered that the favourable effects of ravulizumab SC outweigh the risks. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of ravulizumab SC in the proposed indication is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Ultomiris is similar to Soliris within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Derogation(s) from market exclusivity 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 
and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 the following derogation laid down in Article 
8.3 of the same Regulation apply: 
Assessment report  
EMA/201701/2023

• 
the holder of the marketing authorisation for Soliris has given his consent to the MAH. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of, Ultomiris 245 mg, Solution for injection is favourable in the 
following indication(s): 
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH): 
-  in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity. 
-  in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the  
    past 6 months.  
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome 
(aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have received eculizumab for at least 3 
months and have evidence of response to eculizumab.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Ultomiris subject 
to the following conditions:

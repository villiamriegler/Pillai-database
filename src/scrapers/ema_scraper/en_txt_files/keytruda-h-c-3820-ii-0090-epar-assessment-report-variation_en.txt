Extension of the currently approved therapeutic indication for the treatment of relapsed or refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma (rrcHL) in adults to an earlier line of therapy and to include paediatric 
patients - as follows: 
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 3 years 
and older with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have failed autologous stem 
cell transplant (ASCT) following at least one prior therapy when ASCT is not a treatment option.  
The indication is based on the study KEYNOTE-204, a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial evaluating 
KEYTRUDA monotherapy versus Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) for the treatment of patients with rrcHL and 
supportive data from updated analysis of KEYNOTE-087, which was the pivotal study supporting the initial 
rrcHL indication. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The revised RMP has also been submitted.  
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL); the claimed therapeutic indication was for the treatment of adult and 
paediatric patients aged 3 years and older with relapsed or refractory cHL who have failed autologous 
stem cell transplant (ASCT) or following at least one prior therapy when ASCT is not a treatment option. 
Following the assessment, the agreed indication was for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients 
aged 3 years and older with relapsed or refractory cHL who have failed autologous stem cell transplant 
(ASCT) or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT is not a treatment option.   
Epidemiology 
cHL is a B cell lymphoproliferative disease with distinct clinic and biologic features; it accounts for 
approximately 10% of all lymphomas, 0.6% of all cancers and 0.2% of all cancer deaths. The incidence in 
Europe is approximately 2.4 cases per 100.000 persons, with a characteristic bimodal age distribution: 
one peak in young adults (median age of onset 20 years) and a second peak in older adults (median age 
of onset 65 years). Overall, the majority of patients are young adults, with a peak incidence between 15 
and 35 years and a slightly higher prevalence in males. The actual incidence pattern is known to vary, 
however, according to race and region. 
Biologic features 
cHL is characterised by the presence of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells (i.e. CD30+, CD15+, CD45- bi-
nucleate B cells with a typical “owl’s eyes” morphology) in the context of a mixed inflammatory 
background, which comprises lymphocytes (T-cells are usually predominant), eosinophils, neutrophils, 
macrophages, plasma cells and fibroblasts. The specific inflammatory pattern has prognostic value, 
further classifying cHL into 4 distinct histologic subtypes: nodular sclerosis (70%), mixed cellularity (20-
25%), lymphocyte-rich (5%) and lymphocyte-depleted (<1%) cHL. The rare lymphocyte depleted variant 
is associated with the most aggressive behaviour and worst prognosis. The disease has similar biology 
and natural history in both children and adults age groups. 
Together with NFkB, JAK-STAT signalling is usually hyperactivated in cHL, with a significant impact on the 
differentiation, proliferation, and survival of neoplastic lymphocytes. In particular, dysregulated JAK-STAT 
signalling results in PD-L1 and PD-L2 hyperexpression: binding to PD1 on T cells, PD-L1 and PD-L2 are 
implicated in the "exhaustion" of cytotoxic cells and contribute to cHL cells survival. Alterations in the PD-
L1 and/or PD-L2 genetic loci resulting in increased PD-1 ligands expression (e.g. amplification or 
polysomy of chromosome 9p24.1) are also common in cHL, further highlighting how immune evasion is a 
key element in cHL pathogenesis. 
EBV infection, obesity, high birthweight, smoking, immunosuppression, HLA-A1 and autoimmune 
disorders have all been associated with an increased risk of developing cHL, and in some cases a familial 
predisposition has been reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 9/178 
 
 
  
  
Clinical presentation and prognosis 
cHL usually presents with asymptomatic enlarged lymph nodes or as a neoplastic mediastinal/abdominal 
mass. Systemic “B” symptoms (i.e. fever, night sweats, unintended weight loss, recurrent infections) are 
present in approximately 40% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Pruritus is also common in cHL (~10 
to 15% of patients) and can precede the diagnosis by months or longer. 
Staging of cHL is based on the Lugano classification, which is derived from the Ann Arbor staging system. 
Early stages (I and IIA) are characterised by limited lymph node involvement, while advanced stage 
disease (IIB-IV) is defined by high disease burden in terms of extensive nodal and/or extranodal 
involvement or bulky disease (e.g. a mediastinal mass ≥ 10 cm or with a ≥0.33 ratio of the maximum 
width of the mass and the maximum intrathoracic diameter).  
Prognosis is evaluated by the international prognostic score (IPS) based on serum albumin and 
haemoglobin levels, male gender, age, disease stage and white blood cell/absolute lymphocyte counts. 
Subjects with no risk factors are predicted to have a 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) of 88% and 98%, respectively. Conversely, for patients with 5 or more risk factors the 5-
year PFS and OS are 62% and 67%, respectively. 
Management 
Localised, early stage cHL is usually treated with a combination of abbreviated chemotherapy and low 
dose involved-site radiation therapy and high cure rates (~90%) are usually observed. Advanced stage 
cHL is treated with upfront combination chemotherapy (e.g. ABVD, BEACOPP or STANFORD-V) ± 
involved-field radiation therapy (e.g. in presence of bulky disease and/or residual mass). Brentuximab 
vedotin (BV), an immunotoxin comprised of a CD30-directed antibody linked to an anti-tubulin agent 
(MMAE), has been recently authorised in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine 
(AVD) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma 
(HL), with an overall response rate (ORR) and complete remission rate (CRR) as high as 86% and 73%, 
respectively, and a 82.2% 2-year modified PFS rate (see Connors JM et al, NEJM 2017). Although the 
majority of patients with advanced stage cHL are able to obtain disease remission with combination 
chemotherapy, treatment failures are not uncommon, with relapsed/refractory disease rates as high as 
30-40% in some high-risk settings.  
Salvage therapy is currently based on the use of non cross-resistant chemotherapy regimens (i.e. DHAP, 
IGeV, GemOX plus dexamethasone, ICE etc.) and is able to re-induce disease remission in approximately 
50% of patients. Long-term disease control following conventional therapy alone is uncommon and 
further consolidation is usually needed: younger and fit patients are candidate for high dose 
chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), which can allow 
for long-term disease control/cure in approximately 50% of patients. The German Hodgkin's Lymphoma 
Study Group (GHSG) has identified three adverse risk factors predictive of second relapse following 
salvage therapy and ASCT: time to first recurrence ≤12 months, stage III or IV and/or low haemoglobin 
levels at first relapse (i.e. <10.5 g/dL for females or <12.0 g/dL for males, see Josting A et al, JCO 
2002). The long-term prognosis of patients not eligible ASCT, or who have failed ASCT, is poor: three-
year survival rate is 31% (see e.g. Böll B et al, JCO 2013). 
BV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) cHL following ASCT or 
at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option, or as a 
“consolidation” for the treatment of adult patients at increased risk of relapse or progression following 
ASCT. In a phase II trial in which 102 patients with r/r cHL after prior ASCT were treated with BV (1.8 
mg/kg every three weeks for up to 16 cycles) the ORR was 75% (CRR 34%). 5-year OS was 41% (65% 
for patients who obtained a CR) and 5-year PFS was 22% (52% for patients in CR). Treatment with BV is

Page 10/178 
 
 
  
  
not devoid of toxicities, with peripheral sensory neuropathy (42%) being the most common non-
hematologic adverse event (AE). BV also proved to be an effective “bridge” to transplant (see e.g. Chen R 
et al, Blood 2016; Younes A et al, JCO 2012). 
Prognosis after failure of salvage chemotherapy, including BV, is poor. A selected subset of patients might 
be eligible to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT), which might still result in long-
term remission in a subset of fit patients. However, transplant-related mortality and toxicity is not 
negligible.  
Treatment of rrcHL in children and adolescents follows adult-based strategies, with multi-agent 
chemotherapy followed by myeloablative high-dose chemotherapy with auto-SCT. In patients who have 
previously been refractory to or relapsed from 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy, particularly those with high-
risk disease, these existing treatment options are not satisfactory, leaving little expectation of potential 
benefit, but unavoidable additional toxicity. Therefore, the disease burden caused by paediatric cancers 
remains an area with significant unmet need. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab, MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to block the 
interaction between the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 
immune checkpoint inhibition results in increased functional activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes which 
facilitates immune-mediated anti-tumour activity. The increased expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 cHL 
Reed-Sternberg cells makes PD-1 an attractive target in r/r cHL. Pembrolizumab is currently approved as 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with r/r cHL who have failed ASCT and BV, or who are 
transplant-ineligible and have failed BV on the basis of uncontrolled studies KN-087 and KN-013 in 
subjects with cHL in advanced stages of relapse.  
In this application the initially claimed indication was in adult and paediatric patients who have failed 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or following at least one prior therapy when ASCT is not a 
treatment option. 
The approved indication is “KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and 
paediatric patients aged 3 years and older with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma who 
have failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT is 
not a treatment option”. 
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in paediatric patients aged 3 years and older with 
cHL is 2 mg/kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 200 mg), every 3 weeks administered as an intravenous 
infusion over 30 minutes. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH received SA from the CHMP on the clinical development of pembrolizumab in r/r cHL 
(EMEA/H/SA/2437/9/2015/II). In particular, the adequacy of phase 3 study KN204 was discussed in 
terms of patient population, comparator and magnitude of target effect. The feedback received by the 
CHMP was partially taken into account.  
In addition, a SA was adopted by the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/2437/28/2019/PED/II) on the proposed 
approach to support the registration of a new indication for paediatric patients with r/r cHL. The proposed 
extrapolation concept was in principle considered acceptable

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
The MAH confirmed that all clinical studies were conducted following appropriate Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) standards and considerations for the ethical treatment of human participants that were in place at 
the time the studies were performed. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment has not been included. According to the Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) in all 
cases, except for Type I variations and renewal applications, an ERA or a justification for its absence 
should be provided. Vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted 
because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a 
humanized monoclonal antibody of the IgG4/kappa isotype; being a protein, it is exempt from ERA 
requirements. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacology results are available from two clinical studies (KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-087), 
already included in the previous application to support 200 mg Q3W of pembrolizumab in rrcHL patients 
and are further informed by results obtained in study KEYNOTE-051 to support the inclusion of a 
paediatric indication. 
The updated clinical pharmacology results specific to this submission include: 
• 
PK data of pembrolizumab in paediatric patients with an advanced solid tumor or lymphoma treated 
with2mg/kg Q3W in KN051 study   
•  Update  of  the  existing  population  pharmacokinetic  model  with  additional  paediatric  data  from 
KN051 and adult classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) data from KN204  
•  Comparison of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics and exposures in different age groups of paediatric 
patients to those obtained in adult patients to justify paediatric dose regimens 
• 
Extrapolation  of  adult  data  from  KEYNOTE-204  and  KEYNOTE-087  along  with  the  results  of 
KEYNOTE-051 to support the inclusion of a paediatric indication. 
Absorption 
As pembrolizumab is administered intravenously, bioavailability is 100%. 
Distribution 
Pooled pop PK analysis (all age ranges and several cancer indications) including cHL PK data from KN051, 
KN013, KN087, KN204 estimated the central volume of distribution to 3.37 L (19 %CV) and peripheral 
volume of distribution to 2.61 L (19% CV). Body weight (alpha = 0.540), was selected as predictive 
covariate on both volumes. Age (< 18 years) and value: 0.292; Albumin (value: -0.258), Gender (value: 
-0.123) were selected as predictive covariate for Vc.  
Median central volume of distribution ranged from 0.8 L (2-6 years of age), over 1.3 L (6-12 years of 
age) and 2.3 L (12-18 years of age) to 3.3 L (> 18 years). 
Elimination 
Pooled pop PK analysis (all age ranges and several cancer indications) including cHL PK data from KN051, 
KN013, KN087, KN204 estimated clearance to 0.252 L/day. Weight (alpha = 0.604), Cancer type (HL: -
0.197), Age (< 18 years; value: 0.538), Albumin (value: -0.86), Baseline ECOG (0.065), Bilirubin (value: 
-0.0398), Baseline tumour size (solid tumours only) with value of 0.0985, eGFR (value 0.116), and 
Gender were selected as statistical significant covariates on CL.  
Median clearance ranged with age from 0.047 L/d (2-6 years of age), over 0.092 L/d (6-12 years of age) 
and 0.152 L/d (12-18 years of age) to 0.295 L/d (> 18 years). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Clinical pharmacology of pembrolizumab in participants with rrcHL was described in the KEYNOTE-087 
application to support 200 mg Q3W as the recommended monotherapy dose of pembrolizumab in this 
patient population. 
Following administration of pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W in participants with cHL (KEYNOTE-087), the 
observed median Cmin at steady-state was up to 40% higher than that in other tumour types treated 
with the same dosage; however, the range of trough concentrations is similar. There are no notable 
differences in median Cmax between cHL and other tumour types.  
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 14/178 
 
 
  
  
Following 2 mg/kg Q3W (paediatrics patients, KN051) steady state is overall reached by 15 weeks post-
dose, with a slight trend in ongoing accumulation (PK data by week 81).  
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Participants  with  rrcHL  in  KEYNOTE-204  and  KEYNOTE-087  and  paediatric  participants  with  rrcHL  in 
KEYNOTE-051 comprise the primary participant populations for this application.  
A description of the clinical pharmacology of pembrolizumab in participants with rrcHL was included in the 
KEYNOTE-087  application  to  support  200mg  Q3W  as  the  recommended  monotherapy  dose  of 
pembrolizumab  in  this  patient  population  in  adults.  Following  administration  of  pembrolizumab  200  mg 
Q3W in participants with cHL enrolled in KEYNOTE-087, the observed median Cmin at steady-state was up 
to 40% higher than that in other tumor types treated with the same dosage; however, the range of trough 
concentrations was similar as well as there were no notable differences in median Cmax between cHL and 
other tumor types. 
Previously, a pooled population PK analysis using KN001, KN002, KN006, and KN010 studies was performed 
to  characterize  serum  concentrations  over  time  based  on  a  dataset  including  2841  subjects  across  the 
melanoma and NSCLC indications.  
A  first  extension  of  the  previous  population  PK  analysis  was  conducted  primarily  to  assess  the 
pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab in adult patients with classical Hodgkin Lymphoma and in paediatric 
patients  with  solid  tumors.  For  this  purpose,  paediatric  PK  data  from  study  KN051  and  data  from  adult 
patients with classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) from studies KN013 and KN087 were added to the dataset 
to enhance the relevance of the model for non-solid tumor indications.  
A second extension of the population PK analysis was conducted as outlined in this report with additional 
paediatric data in solid tumors and cHL from KN051 and adult cHL data from KN204 to increase robustness 
of the first extension analysis.  
Based on the extended dataset, the model was refined with a focus on an optimal characterization of the 
pembrolizumab concentration-time data in paediatric patients.  
The  final  model  was  subsequently  used  in  simulations  of  pembrolizumab  PK  parameters  and  exposure 
parameters in different age groups of paediatric patients and compared to the estimates in adult patients 
to support pembrolizumab dose regimen selection in paediatric patients. 
Pembrolizumab PK data from KEYNOTE-051 study (Paediatric patients) 
KEYNOTE-051 was an ongoing Phase I/II Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Children with Advanced 
Melanoma or a PD-L1 Positive Advanced, Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumor or Lymphoma (KEYNOTE-
051). As of the data cutoff date for the submitted report (10-JAN-2020), 162 participants (N=22 rrcHL 
patients) were enrolled out of a total of up to 310 participants that was planned to be enrolled.

Table 2 Overview of cancer types included in the KN-051 PK analysis 
PK samples in KN051 were scheduled as follow: Pre-dose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) 
were obtained within 24 hours prior to dosing at Cycles 1, 2, 4, 8 and every 4 cycles (12 weeks) 
thereafter. Post-dose serum concentrations (Cmax) were drawn within approximately 30-minutes after 
the end of the infusion in Cycle 1 and Cycle 8. Additional PK samples were drawn in Cycle 1 between 72 
to 168 hours (4-8 days) post-dose and at 264 to 408 hours (12-18 days)-post-dose. Phoenix™ 
WinNonlin® (Version 6.3.0.395) software was used for pharmacokinetic analysis. 
For the pharmacokinetic analysis, serum pembrolizumab concentrations with an early PK cut-off date of 
13-Aug-2018 were used from the bioanalytical report. Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Version 6.3.0.395) 
software was used for pharmacokinetic analysis. 
In total, there were 151 participants in KEYNOTE-051 with evaluable PK samples. Observed PK 
concentrations in paediatric participants receiving 2 mg/kg Q3W were within the range of values for 
adults administered 2 mg/kg Q3W.

Overview of bio-analytical methods and assay validation 
Analytical methods 
The  validation  performance  of  the  bioanalytical  assay  for  the  quantitation  of  serum  concentrations  of 
pembrolizumab were summarized. PK and immunogenicity data included in this submission were exclusively 
generated at PPD laboratories using appropriately validated assays.  
The  concomitantly  administered  compounds  MK-1308,  MK-7684,  and  GSK3174998  were  evaluated  for 
potential interference. Data met the acceptance criteria specified in the method validation plan addendum, 
indicating no effect of the stated compounds on the quantitation of MK-3475 in human serum at the levels 
evaluated. Results from analyte interference studies presented indicate there is no effect on the quantitation 
of  MK-3475  in  human  serum  fortified  with  concomitantly  administered  compounds  (MK-1308,  MK-7684, 
GSK3174998)  to  the  stated  concentrations.  Results  from  all  samples  were  within  the  pre-specified 
acceptance criteria. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted and the validation intra- and inter-assay 
data for both the fresh and frozen preparations met the acceptance criteria. 
The addendum provides data on analyte stability in frozen matrix and on conjugated reagent stability. 
Stability was demonstrated after 842 days and at 1218 days (in this case an intermediate calibrator was 
diluted in matrix to the high-level concentration prior the analysis). 
Data from the analysis of MK-3475 stability samples in frozen human serum stored for up to 1217 days at 
-25 °C ± 5 °C and for up to 1218 days at -80 °C ± 10 °C met the criteria for demonstrating stability. 
Data from the analysis of QCs using conjugated reagents stored for up to 1135 days at -80 °C ± 10 °C and 
for up to 30 days at 2-8 °C met the criteria; The results of selectivity assessment in small cell lung cancer 
human serum are reported in this validation report amendment. Results from all samples were within the 
pre-specified acceptance criteria. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA is an antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that 
has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell 
responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which 
are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
There  were  no  cases  of  positive  immunogenicity  status  after  pembrolizumab  treatment  in  paediatric 
participants (0%), while the incidence rate (2.1%) of treatment-emergent positive immunogenicity status 
in adults (Report 052J8M) is low. No additional analyses were performed for the current KEYNOTE-051 CSR. 
The details of the immunogenicity analysis are available in the prior version of the CSR of study KN051 and 
reported below.  
The table below presents an overview of the immunogenicity status of all assessable subjects. To evaluate 
immunogenicity, the overall immunogenicity was defined as the proportion of emergent positive subjects 
to the total number of evaluable subjects (treatment emergent positive, non-treatment emergent positive 
and negative immunogenicity status). 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 22/178 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Table 4 
Out  of  the  133  subjects  included  in  the  immunogenicity  assessment,  125  subjects  were  evaluable.  The 
evaluable subject group contains 2 subjects with non-treatment emergent positive status (1.6%), and 123 
with negative immunogenicity status (98.4%). There were no subjects with a treatment emergent positive 
status observed. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
PK Bridging Analysis 
Model parameters including covariate effects were re-estimated with a focus on an optimal characterization 
of the potential effects of age and body weight in the paediatric population. 
Reliability and robustness of the subsequent final model was assessed by a range of goodness of fit plots. 
Post-hoc parameter estimates from the final model were used to compare pharmacokinetic parameters as 
well as individual pembrolizumab exposure estimates between paediatric and adult populations. 
Simulations from the final model were performed to assess the exposure to pembrolizumab in paediatric 
patients at the dose regimens of 2 mg/kg Q3W or 200 mg Q3W and compare to the exposures in adult 
patients.  Paediatric  covariate  information  for  simulations  was  obtained  from  an  external  dataset  (171 
paediatric oncology subjects) in combination with the paediatric subjects from the pembrolizumab dataset 
(152 subjects). 
Evaluation and qualification of model 
The established population PK model for pembrolizumab had a two-compartment model structure with a 
linear  clearance  from  the  central  compartment,  parameterized  in  terms  of  clearance  (CL),  inter-
compartmental  clearance  (Q),  central  compartment  volume  of  distribution  (Vc),  and  peripheral 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 23/178 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
compartment  volume  of  distribution  (Vp).  All  PK  parameters  were  allometrically  scaled  based  on  body 
weight with separate exponents estimated for the clearance (CL, Q) and volume (Vc, Vp) parameters. 
Additionally, a time-dependent component was estimated on the pembrolizumab clearance. The change in 
clearance over time (TDPK(t)) was described according to an Emax function. 
In addition to body weight, the existing population PK model contained several more covariate relationships, 
which  were  established  through  a  stepwise  covariate  search.  Specifically,  the  following  covariates  were 
included in the model: Age, Gender and Albumin on CL and Vc; Bilirubin, eGFR, Baseline tumor size , ECOG 
performance status and Cancer type on CL. 
No  formal  full  covariate  evaluation  was  planned  as  part  of  this  new  analysis.  Rather,  the  previously 
established  covariate  relationships  were  re-estimated  and  a  focused  reassessment  of  specific  covariates 
was  performed.  Statistical  criteria  for  forward  addition  (P<0.01)  and  backward  deletion  (P<0.001)  were 
identical to previously conducted stepwise covariate model building.  
Model Performance.  
The following goodness-of-fit plots were utilized to assess the adequacy of the structural model to describe 
the pooled dataset. All plots included a specific highlighting of the data from paediatric patients through 
the  use  of  different  markers  to  enable  an  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  the  model  specifically  for  this 
patient group. 
• Observations versus population and individual predictions log-log plots overall and by study  
• Population and individual weighted residuals versus time by study  
• Population weighted residuals versus population predictions  
• Conditional weighted residuals versus population predictions  
• Individual weighted residuals versus individual predictions 
Comparison Paediatrics vs Adults  
Following finalization of the population PK model on the pooled dataset, the final model was used to enable 
comparisons  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  pembrolizumab  between  paediatric  and  adult  patients.  The 
following comparisons were included in this assessment: 1) Comparison of individual posthoc parameter 
estimates, through boxplots and descriptive statistics of individual parameters; 2) Comparison of derived 
individual PK parameters (Cmax at Cycle 1, AUC6wks, t1/2, Cmin at Cycle 1) for selected dose regimens 
between different populations by means of boxplots and tabular summaries of descriptive statistics. 
Simulations in Paediatrics  
In order to project distributions of pembrolizumab PK parameters and exposures in a broader paediatric 
population, a set of simulations was performed. A dataset of individual patient covariate information was 
constructed from which simulation datasets were obtained through resampling.  
The resampling dataset consisted of the subjects included in the analysis dataset. However, since only a 
relatively  small  number  of  paediatric  subjects  in  the  younger  age  groups  were  available  in  the 
pembrolizumab dataset and since no relevant public database containing the required covariate information 
was  readily  available,  the  resampling  dataset  was  augmented  with  a  paediatric  oncology  dataset  from 
another program including 171 subjects aged 0.5 – 17 years.  
The  simulation  dataset  consisted  of  a  total  of  1000  paediatric  and  500  adult  patients  sampled  with 
replacement from the covariate dataset. As no baseline tumor size data was  available for the paediatric 
population,  no  covariate  effect  of  baseline  tumor  size  was  assumed  for  the  paediatric  subjects.  Also,  a 
50/50 distribution of ECOG values 0 or 1 was assumed for the paediatric population. In terms of indication, 
the paediatric subjects were classified as either solid tumor or non-solid tumor type, with the first having 
the  typical  clearance  associated  with  the  melanoma  and  other  indications  in  the  model  and  the  second 
having the typical clearance associated with the cHL indication.

The final population PK model was used to predict the pembrolizumab concentrations following single dose 
and  at  steady  state  for  the  patients  in  the  simulation  dataset.  Distributions  of  the  PK  parameters  CL0 
(Clearance  estimate  at  t=0),  Vc,  AUC6wks  (derived  from  CL0)  as  well  as  of  the  steady-state  Cmax 
(Cmax,ss)  and  Cmin  (Cmin,ss)  estimates  derived  from  the  simulated  concentration-time  profiles  were 
characterized through box-plots and descriptive statistics, according to the following age groups: - <2 years 
/ ≥2-<6 years / ≥6 -<12 years / ≥12 -<18 years / ≥18 years  and  < 3years / ≥3-<6 years / ≥6 -<12 
years / ≥12 -<18 years / ≥18 years. 
RESULTS 
The final analysis data set comprised of a total of 19488 pembrolizumab concentrations from 3293 patients. 
Of  these,  2654  concentrations  were  available  from  301  adult  cHL  patients  and  775  concentrations  were 
available from 152 paediatric patients aged < 18 years with solid tumors and cHL.

Distributions of individual post hoc parameter estimates for clearance and central volume of distribution in 
the paediatric and adult populations are presented in (Figure 1). Figure 2 presents distributions of derived 
pharmacokinetic parameters (based on the post hoc estimates) for the paediatric and adult subjects at the

Overall,  the  pharmacokinetic  model  parameter  estimates  (CL  and  Vc)  are  lower  for  paediatric  patients 
compared to adults. This was expected, since the parameters have been shown to be correlated to body 
weight.  Exposure  parameters  following  the  weight-based  regimen  of  2  mg/kg  Q3W  are  largely  similar 
between the paediatric age groups and between paediatrics and adults.

parameters (Cmax, AUC6wks, t1/2, Cmin) at 2 mg/kg Q3W between paediatrics and adults  
CL and Vd are lower in children as expected, since they correlate directly with the BW. 
The exposure parameters in the box plots are similar between children and adults. A total of 152 paediatric 
participants were included in the updated popPK model. The breakdown of participants by age group and 
tumor type is shown below 
Table 10 Summary of number of subjects in each paediatric age group  
The majority of the paediatric participants is in older age groups 6 to <12 years old (n=35) and 12 to <18 
years old (n=92); while in the younger age groups there are 8 patients <3 years old and 17 patients in the 
group 3 to <6 years old. 
Box plots of post-hoc derived PK parameters for cHL paediatric patients in different group of age and adults 
shows a consistency in exposure parameters among groups except for the AUC values in age <3 years old 
(~50%  higher  compared  to  that  in  adults).  This  was  already  noted  but  however  justified  by  the  flat 
exposure-safety profile of Keytruda between 2 and 10 mg/kg.

The final model was subsequently used in simulations of pembrolizumab PK parameters and exposure 
parameters in different age groups of paediatric patients and compared to the estimates in adult patients 
to support pembrolizumab dose regimen selection in paediatric patients. 
Simulations  
Simulations  of  pembrolizumab  pharmacokinetics  and  concentration-time  profiles  were  performed  for  a 
dataset of 1000 paediatric subjects and 500 adult subjects, obtained through sampling subjects from the 
analysis dataset, augmented with additional paediatric oncology subject data down to 0.5 years of age. A 
summary  of  covariate  information  for  the  combined  paediatric  source  dataset  used  for  re-sampling  is 
provided. The simulated dose regimens were the weight-based regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W and the fixed dose 
regimen of 200 mg Q3W.

Moreover box plots of post-hoc derived PK parameters for cHL paediatric patients in different group of age

the flat exposure-safety relationship for Keytruda. Of note, this does not relate to any conclusions regarding 
safety. 
Interleukin 2 (IL-2) Stimulation 
The interleukin 2 (IL-2) release biomarker reflects the functional blockade of the PD-1 pathway by 
pembrolizumab and is utilized as a measure of target engagement. An in-vitro IL-2 stimulation assay was 
performed to investigate if there is a shift in the IL-2 stimulation curve between adults and children to 
guide the determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of pembrolizumab in paediatric 
patients.  For the in-vitro IL-2 stimulation assay, two pre-dose baseline samples were collected in each of 
the first 12 subjects enrolled.  At the end, 10 subjects provided 20 evaluable samples. Each evaluable 
sample was divided into two aliquots. One of the aliquot from these samples was spiked with 
pembrolizumab concentrations at 300 ug/mL, 100 ug/mL, 33.3 ug/mL, 11.1 ug/mL, 3.70 ug/mL, 1.23 
ug/mL, 0.412 ug/mL, 0.137 ug/mL, 0.0457 ug/mL, and 0 ug/mL with 1 ug/mL staphylococcal enterotoxin 
B (SEB). The remaining aliquots from these samples were respectively spiked with an additional 25 
ug/mLof pembrolizumab (i.e., respective concentrations in these samples were 325 ug/mL, 125 ug/mL, 
58.3 ug/mL 36.1 ug/mL, 28.7 ug/mL, 26.23 ug/mL 25.412 ug/mL, 25.137 ug/mL, 25.0457 ug/mL and 25 
ug/mL) along with the same amount of SEB.  The stimulation ratios were calculated by measuring the IL-
2 concentrations in the two aliquots respectively, i.e. 300 ug/mL with 325 ug/mL, 100 ug/mL with 125 
ug/mL, etc.  The IC50 of the concentration-stimulation ratio curves of in-vitro IL-2 assay in paediatric 
patients (figures below) were compared with that of adult patients using banked blood samples from 
adult cancer patients in KN001.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall,  the  PK  and  clinical  pharmacology  of  pembrolizumab  is  well-known  and  described  over  a  large 
exposure range and various indications.  
Participants  with  rrcHL  in  KEYNOTE-204  and  KEYNOTE-087  and  paediatric  participants  with  rrcHL  in 
KEYNOTE-051 comprise the primary participant populations for this application. 
KEYNOTE-051  is  an  ongoing    Phase  I/II  Study  of  Pembrolizumab  (MK-3475)  in  Children  With  Advanced 
Melanoma  or  a  PD-L1  Positive  Advanced,  Relapsed  or  Refractory  Solid  Tumor  or  Lymphoma  (KEYNOTE-
051).  As  of  the  data  cutoff  date  for  the  submitted  report  (10-JAN-2020),  162  participants  (N=22  rrcHL 
patients) were enrolled out of a total of up to 310 participants that was planned to be enrolled. 
In total, there were 151 participants in KEYNOTE-051 with evaluable PK samples. 
Based on the existing robust characterization of pembrolizumab PK, a comparison was conducted 
between the observed PK of pembrolizumab in children from study KEYNOTE-051 and the predictions 
from the reference PK model developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy data (KEYNOTE-001, -002, -
006, -010, and -024).   
New “overlay” figures at Cycle 1 and steady state are generated for KEYNOTE-051 paediatric participants 
and  KEYNOTE-204  adult  cHL  participants,  based  on  the  updated  popPK  model  including  adult  cHL 
participants and paediatric participants with solid tumors and cHL described in Report 05G4NL. Observed 
data shown in blue refer to cHL participants and data shown in green refer to paediatric participants with 
solid tumors. The paediatric data in KEYNOTE-051 and adult data from KEYNOTE-204 remain well within 
the range of predicted concentration profiles using the updated popPK model. 
The Applicant proposes to extrapolate the efficacy data in adult patients with rrcHL from KEYNOTE-087 and 
KEYNOTE-204  to  paediatric  patients  with  rrcHL  using  a  model-based  PK  bridging  analysis.  In  addition, 
KEYNOTE-051 will provide supportive efficacy and safety data in rrcHL paediatric patients.

The  objectives  of  the  population  PK  analysis  described  in  this  report  were:  1)  to  update  the  existing 
population pharmacokinetic model from report 04LL90 with additional paediatric data from KN051 in solid 
tumors and cHL and adult cHL data from KN204 and 2) to compare pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics and 
exposures in different age groups of paediatric patients to those in adult patients 
Specifically, data from adults with solid tumors (N = 2840) and data from 301 adult rrcHL participants in 
KEYNOTE-013, KEYNOTE-087, and KEYNOTE-204 were included in the analysis. In addition, 151 paediatric 
participants  in  KEYNOTE-051  receiving  2  mg/kg up to  200  mg  Q3W  were  also  included.  From the  study 
report P051V02MK3475 it is known that 22 paediatric participants with HL ranged in age from 10 to 17 
years. Four participants were 10 to 13 years of age and 18 participants were 14 to 17 years of age.  
Only 16 paediatric subjects are assumed to be involved the PK data analyses. In total only 122 PK samples 
have  been  included  in  the  PK  analysis  (0.63%).  Age  of  these  subjects  ranged  from  11-17  years  of  age 
(median: 15 years). Weight ranged from 32.5 to 103.4 kg with a median weight of 50.8 kg. 
Age cut-off is set to 3 years of age. This is not supported by clinical data so far. Exposure simulations have 
been conducted for the age groups of 2-6 years of age and 3-6 years of age. No clinical and no PK data 
have been measured so far in paediatric patients below the age of 11 with HL. 
The existing population PK model for pembrolizumab was used as a basis for an update of the model with 
the  addition  of  data  from  paediatric  patients  with  solid  tumors  and  cHL  and  adult  cHL  patients.  Models 
parameters  including  covariate  effect  have  been  re-estimate  for  the  refined  model.    The  values  of 
parameters estimates are very similar between the previous popPK model and the updated one.  
Goodness-of-fit plots were utilized to assess the adequacy of the structural model to describe the pooled 
dataset.  
As a general comment the goodness of fit evaluation demonstrated the absence of a structural bias as a 
function  of  drug  concentration  or  time  and  showed  that  data  from  paediatric  subjects  is  equally  well 
described as the data from adult subjects. 
However,  no  tornado  plots  (to  demonstrate  the  single  covariate  effects)  or  (stratified)  VPC  have  been 
provided.  In  general,  weight  and  age  is  incorporated.  The  inclusion  of  age  effect  on  both,  volume  of 
distribution and clearance seems to be necessary on top on weight to describe the paediatric data.  
The  MAH  used  the  number  of  prior  line  of  therapies  as  a  stratification  variable,  to  present  the  post-hoc 
model  predictions  of  AUC6wks  (Cmax,ss  and  Cmin,ss  and  half-life,  similar  for  paediatric  and  adult 
participants. In both populations (adults and paediatrics), there is not a clear trend across different prior 
lines of therapy.  
The  reference  population  PK  model  has  been  re-run  including  weight,  allometrically  scaled  with  fixed 
exponents (0.75 for CL and 1.0 for V) in the model, instead of age as requested. The parameter estimates 
and OFV for the new model, Including Weight as Allometrically Scaled Fixed Exponents and Without Age), 
are compared (Run 8) with the final model with age and estimated exponents for weight (Run 6)  
The difference in OFV between the new model (Run 8) and the Reference model (Run 6) is an increase of 
503.861 points. 
This significant increase in OFV together with the GOF plots for Run 8 and Run 6, suggests that the reference 
model with age and extimated exponents better describes the data respect to the new model with no age 
and fixed exponent.  
Simulated exposures (Cmin, Cmax, and AUC) for pediatric participants dosed at 2 mg/kg Q3W obtained using 
the newly  requested  model,  Run 8  showed  that  PK  parameters  across the  weight  range  of  the  pediatric 
participants are contained within the 5th and 95th percentile of adult values. 
The MAH provided the GoF plots for the paediatric population only distinguishing cHL data (black dots) and 
solid tumors data (gray dots), as requested. 
GoFs are provided for each age group (paediatric participants <3 years old, 3 to <6 years old, 6 to <12 
years old, 12 to <18 years old, and adults >18 years old , with gray dots representing participants with 
solid tumors and black dots  representing participants with cHL. Overall, except for minor deviation, the 
observed data are aligned with the line of unity demonstrating that the model adequately described the

data across the entire age range of the data. In addition, VPCs for adults and paediatric participants with 
solid tumors and cHL are provided in different panels showing that adults and paediatrics data with both 
solid or cHL tumor fall within those predicted by the Model. 
CL and Vd are lower in children as expected, since they correlate directly with the BW. 
The exposure parameters in the box plots are similar between children and adults. A total of 152 paediatric 
participants  were  included  in  the updated popPK  model.  The  majority  of  the  paediatric  participants is  in 
older age groups 6 to <12 years old  (n=35) and 12 to <18 years old (n=92); while in the younger age 
groups there are 8 patients  <3 years old and 17 patients in the group 3 to <6 years old. 
Box plots of post-hoc derived PK parameters for cHL paediatric patients in different group of age and adults 
shows a consistency in exposure parameters among groups except for the AUC values in age <3 years old 
(~50%  higher  compared  to  that  in  adults).  This  was  already  noted  but  however  justified  by  the  flat 
exposure-safety profile of Keytruda between 2 and 10 mg/kg. 
The final model was subsequently used in simulations of pembrolizumab PK parameters and exposure 
parameters in different age groups of paediatric patients and compared to the estimates in adult patients 
to support pembrolizumab dose regimen selection in paediatric patients. 
The final population PK model was used to predict the pembrolizumab concentrations following single 
dose and at steady state for the patients in the simulation dataset (different age groups 2-6 (3-6), 6-12, 
12-18, >18 years of age). 
Simulations following 2 mg/kg Q3W and 200 mg Q3W support the per kg dosing as exposure at steady 
state is expected to be in the range of adult exposure (in terms of Cmin_ss, Cmax_ss and AUC) assuming 
paediatric patients of 6 years of age or older. 
Below the age of 6, exposure reached at steady state is higher compared to adults. 
Descriptive statistics of predicted individual exposure parameters for paediatric and adult patients shows 
that Cmin is about 50% higher in the 3-6 age group, although the median value is within the Q3 for adults. 
More explicitly, assuming a lower age limit of 3 years for the first age group, predicted AUC6wks, Cmin,ss, 
Cmax,ss are simulated to be respectively 17%, 52% and 9% higher for the group of 3-6 years compared 
to adults. There are not participants <11 years old with cHL in the analysis dataset and the results in the 
3 to 6 years old age group are informed by participants with solid tumors. 
Simulations from the final model were performed to assess the exposure to pembrolizumab in paediatric 
patients at the dose regimens of 2 mg/kg Q3W or 200 mg Q3W and compared to the exposures in adult 
patients.  
The MAH recognized that there is a small number of paediatric subjects in the younger age group (from 
CSR P051V02MK3475 it seems that paediatric patients ranged from 10 to 17 years) and the resampling 
dataset was augmented with a paediatric oncology dataset from another program. 
This dataset, comprised of 171 participants (aged 0.5 – 17 years), included 22 different tumor types. 
Simulations following 2 mg/kg Q3W and 200 mg Q3W support the per kg dosing as exposure at steady 
state is expected to be in the range of adult exposure (in terms of Cmin_ss, Cmax_ss and AUC) assuming 
paediatric patients of 6 years of age or older. 
Below the age of 6, exposure reached at steady state is higher compared to adults. 
Descriptive statistics of predicted individual exposure parameters for paediatrics and adult patients shows 
that Cmin is about 50% higher in the 3-6 age group, although the median value is within the Q3 for adults. 
More explicitly, assuming a lower age limit of 3 years for the first age group, predicted AUC6wks, Cmin,ss, 
Cmax,ss are simulated to be respectively 17%, 52% and 9% higher for the group of 3-6 years compared 
to adults.  
There are not participants <11 years old with cHL in the analysis dataset and the results in the 3 to 6 years 
old age group are informed by participants with solid tumors.

In Figure 16, the model derived individual PK parameters for paediatric participants dosed at 2 mg/kg Q3W 
pembrolizumab are compared with adult cHL participants dosed at 200 mg Q3W. The figure demonstrates 
that observed exposure parameters in the paediatric participants (cHL data are shown in black dots) are 
generally within the range of values for adult cHL participants dosed at 200 mg Q3W. 
Moreover box plots of post-hoc derived PK parameters for cHL paediatric patients in different group of age 
and adults shows a consistency in exposure parameters among groups except for the AUC values in age 
<3 years old (~50% higher compared to that in adults), but this higher value is not of concern, considering 
the flat exposure-safety relationship for keytruda. 
Of note, this does not relate to any conclusions regarding safety. 
An in-vitro IL-2 stimulation assay was performed to investigate if there is a shift in the IL-2 stimulation 
curve between adults and children to guide the determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) 
of pembrolizumab in paediatric patients. 
The  relationship  between  IL-2  stimulation  and  pembrolizumab  concentration  was  assessed  based  on  10 
participants.  The  IC50  of  the  concentration-stimulation  ratio  curves  of  in-vitro  IL-2  assay  in  paediatric 
patients were compared with that of adult patients using banked blood samples from adult cancer patients 
in KN001. 
According  to  the  MAH,  the  IC50  value  of  the  IL-2  stimulation  ratio  curves  in  paediatric  subjects  are 
consistent with that found in adult subjects supporting the dose of pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W. This in 
indicated in Figures 4 and 5, however the IC50 values are hard to compare by eye.  
The  MAH  presented  results  from  an  Imax  model  that  was  fitted  to  the  available  limited  IL-2  data.  The 
estimated  IC50  value  was  found  to  be  0.14  ug/mL  in  paediatrics  patients  (no  measure  of  variability 
provided), which is in the same range to the IC50 value of 0.535 ug/mL found in adults characterized with 
a wide 95% CI of 0.123 – 2.33, covering the paediatric estimate at the lower end. Paediatric patients might 
need less exposure to reach the same level of inhibition; however the data base in paediatrics with respect 
to IL-2 biomarker is limited. 
E-R relationship for best percent change from baseline tumour size remains very flat, also after recalculation 
and including adult cHL data from KEYNOTE-204 with a dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W and paediatric cHL 
data from KEYNOTE-051 with a dosing regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W. 
The incidence of ADA in paediatric participants was consistent with the adult population. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The data package on clinical pharmacology to support the current variation is limited. There are so far no 
clinical and no PK data available below the age of 10. 
Observed PK concentrations in paediatric patients administered with 2 mg/kg Q3W from study KEYNOTE-
051 were within the range of predicted concentration (reference popPK model) for adults administered 
with the same dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W. However, some issues were identified about this comparison (VPC 
plots, pooling of subject with different tumors types, etc). 
The MAH submitted a popPK analysis built on an existing population PK model for pembrolizumab in patients 
with various tumor types previously described in Report 04LL90 and proposed to extrapolate the efficacy 
and safety data in adult patients to paediatric patients with rrcHL using a model-based PK bridging analysis 
with supportive efficacy and safety data in rrcHL paediatric patients obtained from study KEYNOTE-051. 
The extrapolation is acceptable from the PK point of view.

Further follow up data from the final study report from KEYNOTE -051 will be received in the context of the 
PIP completion. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Pembrolizumab was initially approved for advanced melanoma at 2 mg/kg Q3W. Subsequent approvals 
for adult participants for multiple indications are at 200 mg Q3W dosing regimens. The 200 mg fixed dose 
is now the standard dose globally utilized and approved for numerous other pembrolizumab indications. 
This is also the recommended dose of pembrolizumab for all ongoing clinical studies except paediatric 
studies. 
Pembrolizumab has been dosed at 200 mg Q3W in participants with cHL (KN-204 and KN-087). The 
clinical data in participants with cHL demonstrates efficacy at 200 mg Q3W, which in conjunction with an 
integrated body of evidence in previously approved indications, supports the recommendation of 200 mg 
Q3W as the appropriate dose for patients with cHL. An additional dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W was 
approved in the EU on 28-MAR-2019 for all monotherapy indications approved at the time, including cHL.  
PK exposures in paediatric patients at the 2 mg/kg (up to 200 mg) Q3W dose are expected to be similar 
to those in adults at 200 mg Q3W dose. The dose of 2 mg/kg (up to 200 mg) Q3W is proposed for use in 
paediatric patients with cHL. For additional details on paediatric PK, modeling, and extrapolation of adult 
data see above sections under Clinical Pharmacology.

Objectives 
Primary objectives:  
- 
to compare PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR), according to the IWG 
response  criteria  [Cheson,  2007]  between  treatment  arms,  including  clinical  and  imaging  data 
following  autologous  stem-cell  transplantation  (ASCT)  or  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplantation 
(alloHSCT).  
- 
to compare OS between treatment arms. 
The study was considered to have met its primary objective if pembrolizumab is superior to BV in either 
PFS or OS. 
Secondary objectives:

Outcomes/endpoints 
The following efficacy endpoints were assessed by treatment arm: 
Primary 
Progression-free survival (PFS) – PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented 
disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, as per IWG criteria assessed by 
BICR, including clinical and imaging data following auto-SCT or allo-SCT. 
Overall Survival (OS) - OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects 
without documented death at the time of the final analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow-
up. 
Secondary 
Progression-free survival (PFS-secondary) – Progression-free-survival (PFS-secondary) is defined as the 
time from randomization to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first, as per IWG criteria assessed by BICR, excluding clinical and imaging data following 
auto-SCT or allo-SCT. 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) – ORR is defined as the proportion of the subjects in the analysis 
population who achieved at least a partial response (CR+PR) as per IWG criteria assessed by BICR. 
Complete Remission Rate (CRR) – CRR is defined as the proportion of the subjects in the analysis 
population who achieved a complete remission (CR) as per IWG criteria assessed by BICR.

Duration of Response (DOR) – DOR is defined as time from first response to disease progression or death 
due to any cause, whichever occurs first in subjects who achieve a PR or better, as per IWG criteria 
assessed by BICR and by investigator. 
ORR by PD-L1 Status – as per IWG criteria assessed by BICR for subjects with prepembrolizumab PD-L1 
positive versus PD-L1 negative. 
ORR Post-progression – as per IWG criteria assessed by investigator in subjects who achieved at least a 
partial response (CR+PR) after initial progression of disease.  
PFS, ORR, CRR, and DOR – as per Lugano criteria assessed by BICR 
Second Progression-free Survival (PFS2) – defined as the time from randomization to subsequent disease 
progression after initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, 
by investigator assessment. 
PFS including clinical and imaging data after auto-SCT or allo-SCT as per IWG criteria assessed by 
investigator. 
Disease assessment 
Following screening, lymphoma disease response assessments occurred at Week 12 (±7 days) and every 
12 weeks (±7 days). CT scans were repeated every 12 weeks. PET was repeated at Week 12, Week 24, 
to confirm CR, and as clinically indicated. Response assessments and imaging continued to be performed 
until documented disease progression by BICR review, start of new anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of 
consent, death or study end, whichever occurs first 
For subjects receiving pembrolizumab, after the first documentation of progression, it was the discretion 
of the investigator to stop trial treatment or to keep a clinically stable subject on trial treatment until 
repeat imaging performed 4-6 weeks later confirmed progression. Clinical stability was defined as the 
absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant progression of disease (including 
worsening of laboratory values), no decline in ECOG performance status and absence of rapid progression 
of disease or progressive tumour at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring urgent 
medical intervention. Subjects deemed clinically unstable were not required to have repeated imaging for 
confirmation. If progression was confirmed, then the subject had to be discontinued from trial treatment. 
If progression was not confirmed, then the subject could resume/continue trial treatment provided that 
the sponsor was consulted and provided approval to continue treatment, no other anti-tumour therapy 
(e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, etc.) had been administered. 
Treatment with BV was stopped at any time a lymphoma disease response assessment, verified by 
blinded independent central review showed PD. Although pembrolizumab could be continued, if PD was 
verified by blinded independent central review, the subject was considered to have progressed (i.e., 
counted as an event) at the initial PD assessment for the primary PFS analysis. 
PROs assessment 
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed using the eEuroQol-5D (eEQ-5D), version 1.0, as 
provided by the EuroQol Group, and the EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0, as provided by the EORTC Quality 
of Life Group. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed pre-dose at Cycle 1 (baseline), Cycle 3 
(Week 6), Cycle 5 (Week 12), Cycle 7 (Week 18), and Cycle 9 (Week 24) and every 12 weeks thereafter 
until PD or up to 1 year while the subject is receiving study treatment. Patient-reported outcomes were 
also obtained at discontinuation and at the 30-day Safety Follow-up Visit.

Sample size 
The planned sample size was approximately 300 subjects. The study was event-driven. With 194 PFS 
events, the study had 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.622 (pembrolizumab vs. BV) at alpha = 
1.2% (one-sided). With 146 OS events, the study had 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.600 at 
alpha = 1.25% (one-sided). It was assumed that OS and PFS followed an exponential distribution. 
Power calculations assumed interim analyses (1 for PFS, 2 for OS), an enrolment period of 12 months and 
a cumulative dropout rate of 5% at the end of 3 years. The assumed median PFS and OS in the control 
arm of 5.6 and 22.4 months, respectively, were observed from a published study of subjects with 
relapsed/refractory HL treated with BV, all of whom had received prior SCT. The estimates of PFS and OS 
for BV in r/r HL subjects who have not received prior SCT were unknown at that time. However, based on 
limited data, the ORR and CRR for r/r HL subjects without prior SCT treated with BV were observed to be 
lower than those subjects with prior SCT. It was anticipated that the efficacy would be lower in the 
patient population not receiving SCT, so that control PFS estimate of 5.6 months and OS estimate of 22.4 
months could be considered as over-estimates. 
For the key secondary endpoint of ORR, which could only be tested if the PFS hypothesis was rejected, 
there was 90% power (1-sided 0.6% alpha) to detect an 18-20% improvement on the experimental arm 
assuming the true ORR for the control arm ranges between 60-70%, depending on the actual percentage 
of subjects without prior SCT enrolled. 
Randomisation 
Treatment allocation/randomization occurred centrally using an interactive voice response system / 
integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either 200-mg pembrolizumab or 1.8 mg/kg BV. Randomization was stratified by prior ASCT (Yes vs. No, 
with at least 100 subjects randomized within each level) and HL status after frontline therapy (primary 
refractory disease vs. relapsed disease less than 12 months after completion of frontline therapy vs. 
relapse 12 months or more after completion of frontline therapy). 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. KN-204 was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population served as the population for primary efficacy analysis. All 
randomized subjects were included in this population, and subjects were analysed in the treatment group 
to which they were randomized. 
The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate the PFS, PFS2 and OS curve in each 
treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS, PFS2 and OS was assessed by the stratified log-rank 
test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard (PH) model with Efron's method of tie handling was used to 
assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., HR) between treatment arms. 
For the primary PFS analysis, for the subjects who have PD, the true date of disease progression was 
approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD is objectively documented per IWG by 
BICR, including clinical and imaging data following auto-SCT or allo-SCT, regardless of discontinuation of 
study drug. Death was always considered as a confirmed PD event.

Table 16 Censoring rules for primary, secondary and Sensitivity analyses of PFS  
Adjustment for the effect of crossover on OS could be performed based on recognized methods, e.g., the 
Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time (RPSFT) model, two stage model, etc., based on an examination 
of the appropriateness of the data to the assumptions required by the methods.

Table 17 Censoring rules for PFS2   
The analysis of ORR and CRR consisted of the point estimate and 95% 2-sided exact CI using the 
Clopper-Pearson method with at least 95% coverage of the true rate, by treatment group. The stratified 
Miettinen and Nurminen’s method, weighted by stratum size, was used for comparison of the ORR 
between the treatment groups.  
Response duration (DoR), an exploratory efficacy endpoint, was summarized descriptively by treatment 
arm using the KM method and was defined in the subset of subjects with a CR or PR, based on IWG 
criteria, as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease 
progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

Multiplicity 
For the superiority hypothesis, a Hwang-Shih-DeCani (HSD) alpha-spending function with gamma 
parameter was used to construct group sequential boundaries to control the type I error rate for both 
endpoints. With the selected gamma value of -8 selected, the HSD alpha-spending function was more 
conservative than the O’Brien-Fleming bound. The overall Type-I error across the testing of the OS, PFS 
and ORR hypotheses was controlled at 2.45% (one-sided).  
Figure 15 Multiplicity control strategy   
In addition (not shown in the Figure), α=0.05% (one-sided) was planned to be allocated to the PFS-
secondary hypothesis, this endpoint will not be further analyzed, and the alpha level will not be re-
allocated to other hypotheses. Group sequential methods were used to allocate alpha between the interim 
and final analyses (see above).

PROs 
The following PRO endpoints were assessed for KN-204 at the time of the PFS IA: 
• The mean score changes in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life scale from baseline to 
week 24 
• The mean score change in QLQ-C30 functional scales from baseline to week 24. 
• The mean score change in EQ-5D VAS and utility score from baseline to week 24. 
• The number and proportions of deterioration/stable/improvement from baseline to week 24, the time to 
deterioration (TTD), and the overall improvement rate during the study, i.e.: the QLQ-C30 global health 
status/quality of life scale (two items); the QLQ-C30 functional scales (five scales). 
A change between -10 to 10 points was classified as “stable” and greater than 10 points as 
“improvement”. The change of 10 points was chosen as this magnitude of change was perceived by 
patients as being clinically significant. Since missing data cannot be ignored, the number and proportion 
of patients who “improved”, “stable”, or “deteriorated”, from baseline were summarized by treatment 
group at Week 24 based on MAR imputation of missing data.

Recruitment 
Study KN-204 is conducted globally at 123 centres in 20 countries. The trial is currently ongoing, and the 
available data are based on the 2nd interim analysis (IA2). At the data cut-off date (17 Feb 2020), 304 
participants were randomized (151 in the pembrolizumab arm and 153 in the BV arm). The date of the 
first patient first visit was 29 June 2016, the last patient last visit was 16 January 2020. 
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol was dated 23 December 2015, and five protocol amendments were 
subsequently issued.

A total of 24 participants with 1 or more important protocol deviations were reported. 
Table 21 Summary of Important Protocol Deviations (ITT Population)  
Of these, 4 participants (3 in the pembrolizumab arm, 1 in the BV arm) had important protocol deviations 
that were considered to be clinically important. Clinically important deviation categories included: 
- Inclusion/Exclusion criteria (n=2, pembrolizumab arm): participants entered who did not have relapsed 
or refractory cHL 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 57/178 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
- Safety reporting (n=1, pembrolizumab arm): post alloHSCT events of clinical interest that occur after 
the normal safety follow-up period must be assessed for seriousness and causality and reported to the 
Sponsor 
- Study intervention (n=1, BV arm): participant was administered improperly stored study intervention 
that was deemed unacceptable 
These 4 deviations did not compromise study data integrity so no per-protocol analyses were performed.

Table 23 Summary of reasons for transplant ineligibility at baseline (subjects with one prior therapy)-ITT 
The majority of participants (61.8%) receiving study treatment in second line were ineligible for auto-SCT 
due to age and/or comorbidities and a proportion of the participants (21.8%) were refractory to the primary 
therapy.

Secondary endpoints 
•  Progression-free Survival-Secondary (excluding clinical and imaging data post-SCT) 
PFS-secondary, excluding clinical and imaging data post-ASCT, indicated a clinically improvement in the 
pembrolizumab arm compared with the BV arm: HR 0.62 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.85), although no alpha was 
spent for this endpoint. Median PFS was 12.6 months (95% CI:8.7, 19.2) in the pembrolizumab arm, 
compared with 8.2 months (95% CI: 5.6, 8.6) for participants in the BV arm. The PFS-secondary rates at 
12 and 24 months by KM estimation were 50.4% (95% CI: 41.3, 58.9) and 30.6% (95% CI: 21.5, 40.2), 
respectively, in the pembrolizumab arm compared with 33.3% (95% CI: 24.6, 42.2) and 19.1% (95% 
CI: 11.6, 28.1) in the BV arm (see Figure below).  
Figure 188 KM estimates of PFS based on central review per IWG 2007 (secondary analysis) 
Results of PFS-secondary assessed by investigator remained consistent with PFS-secondary based on 
BICR. 
The HR for PFS secondary was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.64). The PFS secondary rates at 12 and 24 months

•  Objective Response Rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR) 
The ORR (BICR per IWG response criteria) was 65.6% (95% CI: 57.4, 73.1) for pembrolizumab and 
54.2% (95% CI: 46.0, 62.3) for BV. The 11.3% (95% CI: 0.2, 22.1) difference in response rates was not 
statistically significant (stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method p-value: 0.022534).  
Results of ORR assessed by the investigator were consistent with ORR based on BICR. The CRR (BICR per 
IWG response criteria) was 24.5% (95% CI: 17.9%, 32.2%) for pembrolizumab and 24.2% (95% CI: 
17.6%, 31.8%) for BV. CRR assessed by the investigator was consistent with the primary analysis of 
CRR. 
ORR based on investigator review per IWG 2007 including responses post-PD (exploratory endpoint)

EORTC QLQ-C30 
Compliance rates for the EORTC QLQ-C30 remained high from baseline (~92%) to Week 48 (87 to 77%, 
per protocol). At baseline EORTC QLQ-C30 mean scores were similar across treatment arms, but by Week 
24 they had improved in the pembrolizumab arm and deteriorated in the BV arm.  
For GHS/QOL, a difference in LS means between the pembrolizumab arm and the BV arm at Week 24 was 
observed; the difference was 8.60 points, favouring pembrolizumab (95% CI: 3.89, 13.31; two-sided

Table 348 Subject characteristics for select risk factors subgroups 
These subgroup analyses are intended to provide additional context for the primary results and should be 
interpreted with caution as the study was not powered for a definitive demonstration of efficacy in these 
subgroups.  
Age group 
The <50 years group had better PFS and ORR results than the ≥50 years group (HR: 0.53 vs 0.84, ORR % 
difference: 16.20 vs 0.10). 
Bulky disease 
The PFS and ORR results were better in the group with bulky disease at baseline than the group without 
bulky disease (HR: 0.26 vs 0.79, ORR % difference: 37.04 vs 4.03).  
B symptoms 
The PFS and ORR results were similar between groups with and without B symptoms at baseline (HR: 0.66 
vs 0.62, ORR % difference: 9.99 vs 12.83). 
Anaemia 
The PFS and ORR results were better in the group with anaemia at baseline than the group without anaemia 
(HR: 0.47 vs 0.64, ORR % difference: 39.91 vs 4.68). Baseline anaemia was defined as haemoglobin <12 
g/dl (Male) or haemoglobin <10.5 g/dl (Female).  
Disease status after completion of first-line therapy 
In this analysis, participants with best response of PR to first-line therapy, in addition to CR, were considered 
as remission, and remission of less than 3 months, in addition to any response less than PR to first-line 
therapy, was considered as refractory. Based on this categorization, the refractory, early relapse and late 
relapse groups have 149, 66 and 88 participants, respectively; 1 participant with missing information was 
excluded. Results were as follows: refractory (PFS HR: 0.57, ORR % difference: 16.06), early relapse (PFS 
HR: 0.91, ORR % difference: -2.41), and late relapse (PFS HR: 0.61, ORR % difference: 14.99).

The PFS HR for participants enrolled in the EU was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.74), compared with 0.53 (95% 
CI: 0.37, 0.76) in Ex-EU participants.  
Table 35 Analysis of PFS Based on Central Review per IWG 2007 (primary analysis) (EU) 
Figure 27 K-M estimates of PFS based on central review per IWG 2007 in EU vs ex-EU study sites 
Most baseline characteristics in EU versus Ex-EU participants were well-balanced (data not shown). The 
magnitude and nature of noted differences in baseline characteristics in EU versus Ex-EU participants do 
not present a clear pattern to account for the higher HR in the EU population: more participants in the EU 
subgroup had prior use of BV (13.7% vs. 1.0%), fewer participants in the EU subgroup had baseline B 
symptoms (17.9% vs. 29.7%), and the median number of prior lines of therapy was lower in the EU 
subgroup (median 2.0 vs. 3.0, in the EU vs. EX-EU, respectively). 
Subgroup Analysis of PFS-secondary in EU vs. EX-EU subgroup 
The observed HR for PFS-secondary, excluding clinical and imaging data post-SCT, favoured 
pembrolizumab monotherapy over BV in both EU and Ex-EU subgroups. The HR for PFS secondary was 
0.75 (95% CI: 0.41, 1.39) in the EU subgroup and 0.57 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.81) in the Ex-EU subgroup.

Efficacy in transplant-ineligible patients by line of therapy 
With Amendment 2, participants ineligible for auto-SCT were allowed to enrol in the study after failing just 
1 prior line of treatment. It was further clarified in protocol Amendment 3 that participants who were eligible 
for auto SCT were excluded from enrolment. Of the 304 participants in KEYNOTE-204, 192 were ineligible 
for  a  transplant  at  the  time  of  enrolment,  and  112  had  failed  a  transplant  before  enrolling;  of  the  192 
ineligible participants, 55 had failed 1 prior therapy and 137 failed 2 or more prior therapies. Many treating 
physicians considered primary refractory disease patients as chemorefractory and rather than performing 
an auto-SCT that is unlikely to be of benefit, opted to enrol these participants into the study with the goal 
of achieving a better response and minimizing treatment-related toxicity. 
In an exploratory post-hoc analysis of the 55 participants, 27 were in the pembrolizumab arm and achieved 
an ORR of 66.7% (95% CI: 46.0, 83.5) with a CR rate of 14.8% and 28 were in the BV arm and achieved 
an ORR of 53.6% (95% CI: 33.9, 72.5) with a CR rate of 35.7%. The PFS HR was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.31, 
1.59); median PFS was 16.4 months (95% CI: 8.3, NR) and 8.4 months (95% CI: 5.4, NR) and PFS rates 
at 12 months were 58.9% (95% CI: 36.8, 75.5) and 37.4% (95% CI: 16.1, 58.9) in the pembrolizumab

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy analyses by cHL histology 
Efficacy analyses by disease subtype at baseline are provided in Tables below in the HL population of studies 
KEYNOTE-204 (pembrolizumab arm) and KEYNOTE-087, both individually and pooled. Data on HL disease 
subtype were not collected in KEYNOTE-051 and therefore KEYNOTE-051 is not included in the integrated 
analysis.

Table 45 
Four participants in KEYNOTE-087 and 5 in KEYNOTE-204 are missing disease subtype and not included in 
the analyses. Participants from the 2 studies were pooled without adjustments. Since a randomized study 
(KEYNOTE-204) is pooled with a single arm study (KEYNOTE-087), there are limits to the interpretability of 
time to event endpoints given potential differences in the patient populations. 
Efficacy by EU vs. Ex-EU participants 
Efficacy analyses of PFS and ORR are provided in Tables below in the cHL population pooled across studies 
KEYNOTE-204 (pembrolizumab arm), KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-051 by region (EU vs ex-EU).  
The analysis common to all 3 studies was used in the integrated analysis, ie, “PFS secondary analysis” in 
KEYNOTE-204,  which  censors  at  last  disease  assessment  before  SCT  or  new  anti-cancer  therapy  in  the 
absence of PD, and considers PD or death after 2 or more missed assessments as an event. This was the 
primary PFS analysis in KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-051 and selected since both studies did not collect 
scans beyond SCT. Assessment by BICR per IWG 2007 was used for all 3 studies. The trend is generally 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 93/178 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
consistent across all 3 studies and in the pooled population and although the PFS median is lower in EU, 
the 95% CI is wide and overlaps that of the overall population and the medians observed in KEYNOTE-051 
are based on small numbers compared to the other 2 studies. In the analyses, participants were pooled 
without adjustment for the individual study. Since a randomized study (KEYNOTE-204) is pooled with two 
single-arm studies (KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-051), there are limits to the interpretability of time-to-
event endpoints given potential differences in the participant populations. 
Table 46 
Table 47 
For KEYNOTE-204, PFS Sensitivity Analysis 1 is provided by region in Tables below. This analysis considers 
PD or death after 2 or more missed assessments as an event and is otherwise the same as the primary 
analysis. The KM plots for these 2 analyses appear below. Results are generally consistent with the primary 
analysis by region in KEYNOTE-204.

Figure 32 K-M of PFS in EU vs ex-EU 
The impact of SCT on PFS in KEYNOTE-204 is complex because a participant could have progressed prior 
to receiving SCT or not progressed but received anti-cancer therapy resulting in being censored prior to 
SCT. Furthermore, there is an analytical complication because the investigator decides whether to go to 
SCT whereas the primary assessment of PFS is by central review. Because the main difference between the 
PFS primary and secondary definition involves SCT, the MAH has looked more into their relationship and 
SCT. 
Using the PFS secondary definition, there were 26 censored observations in the pembrolizumab arm and 
23 in the BV arm in the EU subgroup of 95 participants, based on central review. Among those censored, 
the number receiving a subsequent SCT was similar across the 2 arms, 26 in total (14 in pembrolizumab 
arm, 12 in BV arm). 
Looking into the possible magnitude of SCT on PFS, “additional” PFS time beyond the censoring date was 
considered based on the primary PFS definition, which does not censor at the time of SCT. For these 26 
participants, approximately half (7 pembrolizumab, 5 BV) had additional PFS time ignoring the censoring 
due to SCT, slightly favoring the pembrolizumab arm. Of note, the arithmetic median “additional” PFS time 
was similar, 16.6 months (including 1 death) in the pembrolizumab arm compared with 18.5 months in the 
BV arm [Table 44]. For the remaining 14 participants, their PFS time is the same, either by the primary or 
secondary definition; 11 of these 14 participants had received other new anticancer therapy before receiving 
the SCT and were censored at the last assessment before the new anticancer therapy in both analyses. 
Although the treatment effect in the EU subgroup using PFS secondary compared with PFS primary definition 
was stronger, it is unlikely this is explained by subsequent SCT.

Clinical studies in special populations (paediatrics) 
Keynote (KN)-051 - A Phase I/II Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Children With 
Advanced Melanoma or a PD-L1 Positive Advanced, Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumour or 
Lymphoma 
Figure 33 Study design   
Methods 
Study design and population 
Study KN-051 is an ongoing, combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 (Part I and Part II), non-randomized, open-
label, single-arm, multi-centre study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), 
toxicity, safety, and antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in in paediatric participants aged 6 months to 
<18 years of age with multiple tumour types. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 97/178 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Part I (dose finding and dose confirmation) has been completed. It used a modified 3+3 design (dose 
finding) and dose confirmation design according to a modified Toxicity Probability Interval approach. Part 
I also evaluated the safety, PK, PD, toxicity, and preliminary efficacy in paediatric participants with 
advanced melanoma or programmed cell death ligand 1-positive (PD-L1-positive) advanced, relapsed or 
refractory solid tumour or other lymphoma.  
Part II (tumour cohort expansion at the RP2D) is ongoing. It further evaluates the safety and efficacy at 
the established RP2D in paediatric participants. In Part 2 participants were enrolled into one of the 
following tumour expansion Cohorts: 
• 
PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed or refractory solid tumors or other lymphoma;  
•  Advanced melanoma;  
• 
rrcHL  
•  Advanced, relapsed or refractory MSI-H solid tumors. 
Participants with melanoma, rrcHL, and MSI-H solid tumors were enrolled irrespective of PD-L1 status.  
Participants with HL were initially enrolled in the Cohort of PD-L1-positive solid tumors and other 
lymphoma (n=15). After implementation of protocol Amendment 7, participants with HL were enrolled in 
the new, dedicated rrcHL Cohort (n=7). 
Male and female participants aged 6 months to less than 18 years of age were eligible for this study. 
Participants were required to have histologically or cytologically documented, locally advanced, or 
metastatic solid malignancy that was incurable and for which (a) participants failed prior standard 
therapy, (b) no standard therapy exists, or (c) standard therapy was not considered appropriate by the 
participant and treating physician. The Inclusion Criteria for the rrcHL Cohort were: 
• 
• 
• 
Refractory to front-line therapy; 
High-risk and relapsed from front-line therapy; or 
Relapsed or refractory to second-line therapy. 
As of protocol Amendment 08, enrolment was stopped for most solid tumours because signals of efficacy 
were not met in solid tumour target cohorts. However, enrolment continued for adolescent participants 
with melanoma (aged 12 to less than 18 years) and paediatric participants with rrcHL (aged 3 to less 
than 18 years) or MSI-H solid tumours (aged 6 months to less than 18 years), irrespective of PD-L1 
status. 
Treatments 
The initial dose in Part I was pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W), the equivalent of the clinical 
adult dose. No dose escalation or de-escalation occurred. Therefore, Part I established 2 mg/kg Q3W as 
the paediatric recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Part II of the study. 
Efficacy objectives and endpoints 
ORR  based  on  RECIST  1.1  per  site  assessment  was  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  solid  tumors  or 
lymphoma. Secondary efficacy endpoints included DOR, DCR, PFS by RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST, OS, and 
biomarkers. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 98/178 
 
 
  
  
 
For  the  dedicated  rrcHL  Cohort  (post  Amendment  7),  primary  efficacy  endpoints  was  ORR  per  BICR 
assessment according to the IWG response criteria (Note: For the current interim analysis only results per 
investigator assessment were provided). 
Secondary efficacy objectives were: to evaluate duration of response (DOR, defined as the time from first 
RECIST 1.1 response to documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs 
first, in participants who achieve a PR or better), disease control rate (DCR, defined as the proportion of 
participants with a response of CR, PR, or SD) and progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1; to 
evaluate ORR, DOR, DCR, and PFS by irRECIST (i.e. immune-related RECIST) and overall survival (OS).  
The primary efficacy objective in Part II was to evaluate antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in the rrcHL 
Cohort based on the ORR per blinded independent central radiology review (BICR) assessment according 
to the International Working Group (IWG) response criteria, based on assessments every 12 weeks. 
Secondary objectives in part II were to evaluate antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in the rrcHL Cohort 
according to the IWG response criteria based on assessments every 12 weeks by the following endpoints:  
ORR, DOR, and PFS per site assessment; ORR, DOR, and PFS per BICR; OS. Assessing the ORR of 
pembrolizumab by BICR using the Lugano Classification was an additional exploratory objective. 
Disease response in paediatric participants in the PD-L1-positive solid tumours and other lymphoma 
cohort was retrospectively re-assessed using IWG 2007 criteria. In addition, Lugano criteria was also 
used for disease response re-assessment for both “PD-L1-positive solid tumors and other lymphoma” and 
“dedicated rrcHL” cohorts. 
Sample size and statistical methods 
A total of up to 310 participants was planned to be enrolled. The primary efficacy and safety population 
was the All Subjects as Treated population, which included all allocated participants who received ≥1 dose 
of pembrolizumab. ORR as assessed by the investigator was evaluated separately for each tumour type, 
and participants without response data were counted as non-responders. For DOR, PFS, and OS 
endpoints, Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and median estimates from the KM curves were provided. 
Participants without efficacy evaluation data or without survival data were censored at Day 1 in the PFS 
and OS analyses. Participants who did not achieve a response were excluded from the DOR analyses. 
Results 
Disposition, Demographics, and Baseline Characteristics 
Median age was 13 years (range 1 to 17 years). Participants were enrolled across approximately 29 
tumour types by primary diagnosis. The most common primary diagnoses (in ≥5% of participants) were 
solid tumour NOS (18.0%), HL NOS (9.3%), glioblastoma multiforme (9.3%), soft tissue neoplasm NOS 
(7.5%), neuroblastoma (6.2%), osteosarcoma (6.2%), melanoma (5.6%), and CNS primary tumour NOS 
(5.0%). The 22 participants with HL ranged in age from 10 to 17 years. Four participants were 10 to 13 
years of age and 18 participants were 14 to 17 years of age. 3 participants were between 6 months and 2 
years.

Study recruitment 
The study is ongoing; first participant first visit was on 23-MAR-2015; at the data cut-off 10-JAN-2020 
(IA9) 162 participants were enrolled, 161 were treated, 8 (5.0%) completed the protocol-specified 
maximum treatment duration of 35 administrations (approximately 2 years), 4 (2.5%) were continuing 
study treatment, and 157 (97.5%) discontinued study treatment. Fifty-one (31.7%) participants were 
ongoing in the study.  
The median duration of follow-up was approximately 3-fold longer for participants with HL (23.7 months) 
than for participants with all other tumour types (8.3 months), primarily due to the large number of early 
deaths among the other tumour types. 
Subsequent Oncologic Treatments - Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma: 14 of the 22 participants 
with HL received subsequent oncologic therapies after discontinuing treatment with pembrolizumab 
(including chemotherapy, BV, pembrolizumab and nivolumab).

Methods 
Study design and population 
KN-087 is an ongoing, multicenter, single-arm, multi-cohort, non-randomized Phase 2 study of IV 
pembrolizumab in adult patients with R/R cHL who failed to achieve a response or progressed after 
autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT) and relapsed after treatment with, or failed to respond to 
treatment with, brentuximab vedotin (BV) post-ASCT (Cohort 1); who were unable to achieve a complete

response (CR) or partial response (PR) to salvage chemotherapy and did not receive ASCT, but relapsed 
after treatment with, or failed to respond to treatment with, BV (Cohort 2); and who failed to achieve a 
response to, or progressed after, ASCT, and had not received BV after ASCT and did or did not, receive 
BV as part of primary treatment or salvage treatment (Cohort 3). 
Treatment 
Pembrolizumab was administered at the dose of 200 mg once every 3 weeks.  
Efficacy objectives and endpoints 
The study primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab 
by blinded, independent central review (BICR) according to the International Working Group (IWG) 
response criteria within each of the 3 cohorts of participants with R/R cHL. Secondary objectives were to 
evaluate: the ORR using the Lugano Classification, the CRR by the IWG criteria and the Lugano 
Classification, to evaluate PFS, DoR and OS. 
Sample size and statistical methods 
Approximately 60 participants were planned to be enrolled per cohort. The primary population for efficacy 
analysis was the All-Subjects-as-Treated (ASaT) population: all enrolled participants were included if they 
received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
ORR analysis consisted of the point estimate and 95% 2-sided exact confidence interval (CI) using the 
Clopper-Pearson method. An exact binomial test was conducted versus a fixed control rate. CRR analysis 
consisted of the point estimate and 95% 2-sided exact CI using the Clopper-Pearson method. DOR was 
analysed in all responders by summary statistics using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, with participants 
in response censored at their last assessment. PFS was analysed in all responders by summary statistics 
using the KM method, with missing data censored at last assessment. OS was analysed by summary 
statistics using the KM method, with missing data censored at last assessment. 
Results 
Disposition, Demographics, and Baseline Characteristics 
Per protocol, all study participants had cHL, participants in Cohorts 1 and 3 were post-auto-SCT, and 
participants in Cohort 2 had not received an auto-SCT. The most common subgroup of cHL was nodular 
sclerosing Hodgkin Lymphoma (169 participants [80.5%]). All participants were heavily pre-treated, with 
a median of 4.0 prior lines of therapy (range: 1 to 12). A total of 175 participants (83.3%) had previously 
failed to respond to or relapsed after treatment with BV. Seventy-seven participants (36.7%) had prior 
radiation therapy. Median Age (Range) was 34 years (19 to 64 years) in cohort 1; 40 years (20 to 76 
years) in cohorts 2; 32 years (18 to 73 years) in cohort 3. 
Number of Participants Randomized/Treated/Ongoing/Discontinued 
A total of 210 participants were allocated and treated in this study: 69 in Cohort 1; 81 in Cohort 2, and 
60 in Cohort 3. As of the data cutoff date of 21-MAR-2019, 46 participants (21.9%) had completed the 
protocol-specified maximum treatment duration of 35 administrations (approximately 2 years) and 164 
participants (78.1%) had discontinued study treatment. The most common reason for treatment 
discontinuation was disease progression (including events of clinical progression; [n=91]). The median 
duration of follow-up was 39.5 months (range: 1.0 to 44.8).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Pivotal  study  KN-204  is  a  phase  III,  randomised,  open-label  clinical  trial  designed  to  compare 
pembrolizumab vs. BV in subjects with r/r cHL. All patients with r/r cHL could be enrolled irrespectively of 
number of prior lines of therapy or refractory/relapsed disease status. Out of safety concerns subjects who 
received allogeneic HSCT within the last 5 years or had clinically relevant autoimmune conditions, active 
infection, CNS localization or current/previous pneumonitis were excluded: this is in line with the currently 
approved Keytruda SmPC and acceptable.  
The study population underwent several changes over the course of the study, eventually resulting in high 
heterogeneity:  under  protocol  amendment  2,  e.g.,  subjects  who  previously  responded  to  BV-containing 
regimens became eligible. Re-treatment of responders to BV is reflected in the current SmPC of Adcetris 
and is not controversial. Diverging form previous CHMP SA, however, protocol amendment 2 also allowed 
for the inclusion of patients with one single prior line of therapy, regardless of their transplant eligibility 
status.  Then,  following  Amendment  03,  patients  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  eligible  to 
ASCT/alloHSCT were definitely excluded from trial participation.  
The main aim of salvage treatment in r/r cHL is to obtain a second remission and proceed to ASCT. Salvage 
chemotherapy  followed  by  ASCT  can  allow  for  long-term  disease  control/cure  in  up  to  50%  of  patients. 
Transplant  eligibility  is  usually  evaluated  based  on  response  to  salvage  treatment  and  residual 
chemosensitivity. Subjects with chemoresistant disease (i.e. patients unable to achieve a second remission 
or  at  least  a  significant  reduction  of  disease  bulk  with  salvage  regimens)  are  not  considered  eligible  to 
ASCT, since the expected benefit of transplant in this subgroup is limited. Some patients can be considered 
upfront ineligible to ASCT because of age and/or significant comorbidities. 
Although  the  prognostic  impact  of  refractoriness  to  frontline  chemotherapy  is  recognised,  it  cannot  be

considered,  per  se,  a  major  criterium  to  define  transplant  ineligibility  (see  e.g.  Hoppe  RT  et  al,  NCCN 
guidelines for HL v.2.2020).  
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive up to 35 cycles of either pembrolizumab at the approved 200mg 
Q3W dose regimen or BV at the standard 1.8 mg/kg dose Q3W. According to the current Keytruda SmPC 
(section 4.2), patients are expected to continue pembrolizumab until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. However, no subject received pembrolizumab for more than 35 cycles in study KN-204 and limited 
data  are  currently  available  on  response  duration  following  pembrolizumab  discontinuation  at  cycle  35. 
Consistent recommendations are included in the SmPC.  
BV could also be continued up to 35 cycle, yet, the currently approved SmPC for Adcetris specifies that r/r 
cHL patients who achieve stable disease (SD) or better could receive a minimum of 8 cycles and up to a 
maximum  of  16  cycles  of  BV.  Since  a  limited  number  of  subjects  received  less  than  8  or  more  than  16 
cycles of BV in study KN-204 and no significant efficacy/safety issues have been observed in these subsets, 
the impact of prolonged BV administration on B/R evaluations is considered limited. 
The choice of BV as comparator is acceptable for subjects not eligible to additional chemotherapy, being 
the current standard for patients who have failed ASCT or at least two lines of therapy.   
The prognostic impact of the chosen stratification factors for randomisation (prior ASCT and disease status 
after  frontline  therapy)  is  recognised.  The  role  of  other  factors  with  known  prognostic  relevance  (e.g. 
presence  of  bulky  or  extranodal  disease,  response  to  prior  therapy  and  anaemia  at  relapse),  was  also 
investigated in dedicated post-hoc subgroup analyses.  
PFS (assessed by BICR according to IWG response criteria [Cheson, 2007], including clinical and imaging 
data following auto-SCT or allo-SCT) and OS were selected as dual primary efficacy endpoints to assess 
clinical  benefit:  this  is  agreed.  Although  study  KN-204  was  designed  to  claim  success  in  the  case 
pembrolizumab was confirmed superior to BV in either PFS or OS, consistency of results across primary 
endpoints is nonetheless expected. In this regard, since BV and pembrolizumab are both approved in the 
EU for the treatment of cHL patients in advanced settings of relapse, the possibility of a confounding effect 
of systematic off-study cross-over on OS cannot be excluded.  
The other secondary/exploratory endpoints (e.g. ORR, CRR, DoR, ORR post-progression, PFS2 and PROs 
explored using the validated EQ-5D and EORTC QLQ-C30 instruments) are considered overall adequate to 
further characterize pembrolizumab efficacy in the target population. Although the older 2007 IWG response 
criteria were used for the primary efficacy analyses, additional analyses using the 2014 Lugano response 
criteria were also provided.  
From a methodological perspective, the planned sample size (n=300) in study KN-204 is congruent with 
clinical assumptions and adequate to allow for the detection of a HR of 0.62 for PFS with a 85% power at 
alpha 1.2% (one-sided), a HR of 0.6 for OS with a 80% power at alpha 1.25% (one-sided) and a 18-20% 
improvement in ORR with a 90% power at alpha of 0.6% (one-sided and provided that the PFS hypothesis 
is  rejected).  Four  interim  analyses  (IAs)  and  one  final  analysis  (FA)  were  pre-specified.  The  statistical 
methods used to test time to event and binary endpoints are standard and the overall strategy to control 
multiplicity  is  not  controversial.  With  respect  to  PROs,  the  EQ-5D  and  EORTC  QLQ-C30  instruments  are 
validated  and  acceptable.  The  10-point  change  considered  as  minimal  important  difference  (MID)  was, 
however,  poorly  justified  beyond  a  generic  statement  that  this  difference  was  perceived  as  clinically 
meaningful by the patients. Imputation under MAR was also planned to address missing data, yet no reason 
was provided to justify the MAR assumption. Most importantly, no strategy to control multiplicity was put 
in place for PROs analyses, and the open-label study design further questions results reliability. 
Supportive study KN-087 is an ongoing, single-arm, multi-cohort, non-randomized Phase 2 study 
investigating the efficacy of pembrolizumab monotherapy in a heterogeneous population of patients with 
cHL in advanced settings of relapse. Cohort 3, which also included BV-naïve patients, can be considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 113/178 
 
 
  
  
the most informative for the claimed indication. Results for study KN-087 were pivotal in supporting the 
initial indication of pembrolizumab for the treatment of r/r cHL (see EPAR for procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0014). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Three-hundred  and  thirty-eight  subjects  were  screened  in  study  KN-204  and  304/338  (~89.9%)  were 
eventually randomised to receive either pembrolizumab (n=151) or BV (n=153). At the time of the data 
cut-off date the vast majority of subjects had discontinued study treatment. 
Sixty-four (~21%) subjects underwent subsequent ASCT and 27 (~9%) allogeneic HSCT, with no significant 
differences across study arms. Considering that transplant-eligibility was an exclusion criterion, the high 
rate  of  patients  receiving  subsequent  transplant  in  study  KN-204  further  highlights  the  difficulties  in 
prospectively defining transplant eligibility in cHL.  
Demographic  characteristics  were  generally  well  balanced  across  treatment  arms  and  overall  consistent 
with what expected in a population of patients with r/r cHL. Nearly all subjects had a good performance 
status  at  the  time  of  study  entry  (ECOG  score  was  0-1  in  99.7%  of  subjects),  the  majority  had  no  B-
symptoms  (73.7%)  and  only  19.7%  and  5.6%  had  bulky  disease  and  bone  marrow  involvement, 
respectively.  
The  median  number  of  prior  lines  of  therapy  was  2,  with  a  median  of  3  prior  regimens  received,  and 
approximately  40%  and  37%  in  both  treatment  arms  had  received  prior  radiotherapy  (RT)  and  ASCT, 
respectively. Only a minority of patients had received prior BV (~5%, 10 patients in the BV and 5 in the 
pembrolizumab arm). Overall, nearly 70% of patients had primary refractory or early relapsed disease (i.e. 
response duration ≤12 months), identifying a high-risk clinical setting.  
Taking into account the broad claimed indication and the significant heterogeneity in the study population, 
baseline  characteristics  stratified  by  number  of  prior  lines  of  therapy  and  transplant  eligibility  were  also 
provided. Overall, despite the fact that under protocol versions 1 and ≥3 inclusion was limited to transplant 
ineligible patients, only 192/304 (63%) patients in study KN204 were deemed transplant ineligible at the 
time of enrolment. As expected based on current guidelines, most transplant-ineligible patients (137/192 
[~71%])  had  received  ≥2  prior  lines  of  systemic  therapy  and  only  55  patients  (29%  of  all  transplant-
ineligible  patients  and  18%  of  the  overall  study  population)  were  deemed  transplant  ineligible  after  one 
single line of therapy.  
With respect to transplant-ineligible subjects with ≥2 prior therapies, median age was 34 years (range 18 
to 83), only 10.8% of patients were aged ≥65 years (3.2% aged ≥75) and most subjects had a baseline 
ECOG score of 0 or 1 (58.2% and 41.4%, respectively). Approximately 30% were refractory to frontline 
chemotherapy  and  ~37%  had  received  prior  ASCT.  Nodular-sclerosis  was  the  more  represented  cHL 
histological subtype (~81%) and bulky disease, B symptoms and bone marrow involvement were present 
in approximately 21%, 28% and 4% of patients, respectively.  
Transplant-ineligible subjects with one single prior line of therapy were older (median age at baseline was 
49 years), with 40% of patients aged ≥65 years and 12.7% (7/55) ≥75 years. Baseline ECOG PS score 
was 0 (74.5%) or 1 (25.5%) in all subjects. The proportion of patients in this subgroup that were refractory 
to frontline chemotherapy was ~22% and, as expected, none had received prior ASCT. Most patients had 
nodular-sclerosis cHL (~82%) and only ~15% had bulky disease, 16% reported B symptoms at baseline 
and ~11% had bone marrow involvement. 
With a median follow-up of approximately 2 years, the primary PFS analysis can be considered sufficiently 
mature (e.g. 55% of patents having experienced at least one PFS event). Study KN-204 met the primary 
PFS endpoint: pembrolizumab demonstrated a statistically significant superiority in PFS compared to BV. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 114/178 
 
 
  
  
Median PFS was 13.2 months (95%CI 10.9, 19.4) and 8.3 months (95%CI 5.7, 8.8) in the pembrolizumab 
and in the BV arms, respectively (HR 0.65, 95%CI  0.48, 0.88, p=0.00271). The external validity of the 
data is supported by the fact that PFS outcomes observed in the BV arm of study KN-204 were overall in 
line with those reported in the Adcetris registrational trial (study SG035-0003), where a ~6 months median 
PFS was observed in a more advanced patient population. The estimated 24-month PFS rate was 35.4% 
and  25.4%  for  pembrolizumab  and  BV,  respectively.  Results  from  the  planned  sensitivity  analyses  and 
secondary  PFS  endpoints  were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis;  in  particular,  results  from  the 
secondary PFS analysis censoring patients at the time of transplant confirmed study outcomes (HR 0.62, 
95%CI  0.46,  0.85),  showing  that  the  impact  of  subsequent  transplant  on  the  relative  efficacy  of 
pembrolizumab vs. BV was overall limited.  
In a population often characterised by significant chemoresistance, ORR was numerically higher with 
pembrolizumab compared to BV (65.6% [95%CI: 57.4, 73.1] and 54.2% [95%CI: 46.0, 62.3], 
respectively), yet confidence intervals largely overlapped and no significant differences could be observed 
in terms of CR rates (24.5% [95%CI 17.9%, 32.2%] with pembrolizumab and 24.2% [95% CI 17.6%, 
31.8%] with BV). DoR data were not sufficiently mature, yet a possible trend towards longer response 
duration with pembrolizumab could be observed (mDoR 20.7 vs. 13.8 months). The fraction of patients 
with response duration longer than 24 months was, however, similar across treatment arms (47.4% vs. 
42.8%, respectively). 
Higher ORRs were observed in both treatment arms when the Lugano response criteria were applied: 
72.8% and 67.3% with pembrolizumab and BV, respectively. The analysis applying the Lugano criteria 
also resulted in higher rates of remission, in particular in the BV arm (CRR 30.7%). Despite similar PFS, 
DoR according to the Lugano criteria was significantly shorter in both treatment arms (16.8 and 5.8 
months, with pembrolizumab and BV, respectively). 
Pembrolizumab and BV are both authorised in the EU for the treatment of cHL patients in advanced settings 
of relapse, making uncontrolled cross-over a possible issue. In this regard, PFS2 data are considered of 
value. Unfortunately, at the time of data cut-off date, the PFS2 analysis was still largely immature, with 
just 27.8% and 35.3% of events observed in the pembrolizumab and BV arms, respectively. Reassuringly, 
a favourable trend could still be observed (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.38, 0.87, p=0.0037), yet updated data and 
detailed information on subsequent treatments are needed to exclude significant differences in treatment 
patterns across study arms. 
The MAH remains blinded to subsequent efficacy data post-IA2 and the first planned formal OS analysis is 
to occur at ~91 events (IA3), which is not expected to occur until the second quarter of 2022 based on the 
event rate observed at the data cutoff used for IA2 (16-JAN-2020). An update for PFS2, as well as pre-
planned analyses assessing effect of crossover on OS will be provided. 
With respect to PROs, a trend towards an improvement could generally be observed with pembrolizumab, 
yet the open-label design of study KN-204 and the absence of any multiplicity control strategy do not allow 
to uphold formal superiority claims. 
Overall, pembrolizumab demonstrated a consistent benefit across subgroups with the main exception of 
regional differences. Despite there were no obvious imbalances in baseline characteristics that could 
explain the negative trend in EU vs. ex-EU participants, subgroup analyses suggested inferior efficacy (HR 
0.93) [95% CI: 0.50, 1.74], compared with for participants in the EU (n=95) compared to Ex-EU 
participants (n=209); HR 0.53 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.76]. Median PFS in this subgroup (16.4 months with 
pembrolizumab and 8.3 months in the BV arm) was in line with what observed in the overall population, 
yet KM plots showed that, after an initial separation, PFS curves re-joined to remain overlapped in a sort 
of plateau configuration. No similar trend could be observed in the overall population or in the ex-EU 
subset. PFS and ORR results stratified by region for the pooled HL population across studies KEYNOTE-
204, KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-051 were also provided. The methodological limitations, especially 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 115/178 
 
 
  
  
regarding interpretability of time-to-event endpoints and the overlapping of the confidence intervals, are 
acknowledged; nonetheless, also in the relatively large study KN-087 (n=210) a similar trend towards 
reduced benefit in the EU vs. ex-EU population was observed (ORR difference 7% and median PFS 
difference 2.5 months in the pooled dataset). Results of PFS Sensitivity Analysis 1 in KEYNOTE-204 
confirmed the primary analysis by region. Since the observed regional differences appeared to be less 
pronounced in the PFS secondary subgroup analysis (PFS censored at the time of transplant), the MAH 
also evaluated the impact of SCT on PFS in the KEYNOTE-204 EU participants. However inter-treatment 
arm differences in the arithmetic median of “additional” PFS time after SCT (i.e. beyond the censoring 
date of the PFS secondary analysis that was considered based on the primary PFS definition) were only 
small and therefore, differences between PFS primary and secondary analyses cannot be easily explained 
by subsequent SCT: the observed differences across regions remain unclear.   
Similar clinical outcomes were observed in subjects with 1 and ≥2 prior lines of therapy: the ORRs with 
pembrolizumab ranged between 61.8% and 66.7% across all subsets defined by number of prior therapies 
and transplant eligibility vs. 46.4%-54.4% with BV. PFS also consistently favoured the pembrolizumab arm 
across  all  prior  lines  of  therapy  subgroups,  with  mPFS  ranging  between  16.4  and  11.1  months  with 
pembrolizumab  vs.  8.4-5.7  months  with  BV  (HR  0.62-0.70).  Overall,  efficacy  results  were  usually  more 
favourable  in  less  pre-treated  subjects  with  one  notable  exception:  a  lower  CRR  was  observed  with 
pembrolizumab in patients with 1 prior line of therapy (14.8% vs. 25.7% with BV). 
Updated  results  with  a  median  follow-up  of  approximately  40  months  were  also  provided  from  the 
uncontrolled supportive study KN-087, showing an IWG ORR by BICR of 71% (95%CI 64.3, 77) and 71.7% 
(95%CI 58.6, 82.5) in the overall population and in cohort 3, respectively. CRRs were 27.6% and 31.7%, 
median DoR 16.6 and 16.8 months and median PFS 13.6 and 16.8 months, respectively. Median OS was 
not reached in all cohorts. With the limits of indirect comparisons, efficacy results in study KN-087 can be 
considered supportive of the activity of pembrolizumab in r/r cHL. 
BV is a recognised option for subjects who have failed salvage chemotherapy +/- ASCT (i.e. 3rd line), so 
the ~5-month Δ in median PFS observed in the pivotal study with pembrolizumab vs. BV, which is equivalent 
to  ~35%  reduction  in  the  risk  for  progression  or  death,  can  be  considered  of  clinical  relevance  in  such 
advanced clinical setting. PFS K-M plots did not show any clear plateau, however, confirming how cure is 
rarely  achieved  in  advanced  relapse  settings. However,  assessing  clinical  benefit  with  pembrolizumab  in 
subjects  who  have  failed  one  single  line  of  therapy  was,  less  straightforward.  According  to  current  EU 
guidelines (see e.g. the ESMO guidelines for cHL, Eichenauer DA et al, Ann Oncol 2018), non-cross resistant 
chemotherapy  is  still  the  recommended  option  for  patients  failing  frontline  treatment,  while  BV  is  not 
currently authorised in EU as 2nd line treatment. In this regard, published data show that ORR as high as 
80% (CRR 20-70%) can be observed with salvage polychemotherapy, with 4-year EFS rates of 50% and 
10% in transplant-naïve and non-transplant eligible patients, respectively, and 4-year OS rates as high as 
70% and 30% for patients who received or not consolidation ASCT, respectively (see e.g. Bartlett NL et al, 
Ann Oncol. 2007; Kuruvilla J et al, Cancer 2006; Santoro A et al, JCO 2016). For less intensive regimens 
based  on  single-agent  gemcitabine  or  bendamustine  the  reported  ORRs  were  still  in  the  range  40-55% 
(CRRs 7% and 37%, respectively). A median TTP of 3 months (range, 2-7 months) has been reported with 
single-agent gemcitabine, while the median DoR with bendamustine monotherapy was as high as 8 months, 
although this analysis was still immature, with all responders maintaining a continuous response at the last 
follow-up examination (see e.g. Ozdemir E et al, Blood 2015; Zinzani PL et al, Clin Lymphoma Myeloma 
Leuk 2015). Even considering patient heterogeneity and the known limits of indirect comparisons, clinical 
benefit with pembrolizumab in 2nd line patients not eligible to transplant is not considered established.  
With  respect  to  2nd  line  patients  (n=55),  a  heterogeneous  population  was  included  in  study  KN-204 
encompassing both upfront transplant-ineligible patients (e.g. due to age and comorbidities) and subjects 
who  were  refractory  to  frontline  chemotherapy.  Only  34/55  2nd  line  patients  were  deemed  transplant-
ineligible for reasons other than chemo-refractoriness, just 22/55 (40%) were aged ≥65 and 7/55 (12.7%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 116/178 
 
 
  
  
≥75 years. No information was provided on concurrent comorbidities that contraindicated ASCT and most 
patients (74.5%) had a baseline ECOG score of 0. Overall, it is uncertain whether 2nd line patients in study 
KN-204 can be considered representative of real-world transplant ineligible patients and to what extent the 
observed results can be generalised to such frail population. 
With  respect  to  subjects  refractory  to  frontline  chemotherapy,  published  data  suggest  that  autologous 
transplant  remains  the  best  strategy  to  achieve  long-term  disease  control  (see  e.g.  Sibon  D  et  al, 
Haematologica 2016):  the  need  for  novel  salvage  therapies  characterised by  high  CRR  rates to improve 
transplant access for primary refractory patients is recognised. In this regard, however, only 21 2nd line 
patients were deemed ineligible to ASCT due to primary chemoresistance in study KN-204 and the CRR rate 
observed in this 2nd line subgroup (14.8%) was not sufficiently compelling. 
The limited available data in 2nd line transplant-ineligible patients are not considered adequate to conclude 
for clinical benefit in this subgroup. The indication was eventually revised to reflect this. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Study  KN-051  is  an  ongoing  Phase  I/II  study  investigating  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  paediatric 
patients with solid tumours and malignant lymphomas. Paediatric subjects with r/r cHL could be enrolled in 
the  dedicated  r/r  cHL  expansion  cohort  or  in  the  PD-L1  positive  advanced,  relapsed  or  refractory  solid 
tumour or other lymphoma cohort, provided that they had failed standard therapy and no other treatment 
option  was  considered  appropriate.  The  IWG  response  criteria  were  used  to  assess  response  in  the 
dedicated cHL cohort, while response in the PD-L1 positive cohort was assessed according to the RECIST 
1.1 criteria. Efficacy data were also retrospectively re-assessed using the IWG 2007 and the 2014 Lugano 
response criteria for all patients. 
Overall, 22 paediatric patients with r/r cHL were treated in study KN-051: 7 patients enrolled in the 
dedicated cHL cohort and 15 in the PD-L1 positive cohort. The median number of prior lines of therapy in 
the paediatric population was 2 vs. 3 in study KN-204, most patients (13/22, ~60%) had received ABVD-
like regimens in first line, which is not unexpected taking into account that adolescents made up for the 
majority of the studied population and they are often treated according to adult standards in real world 
clinical practice. In line with the high-risk population studied in the KN-204 trial, most cHL patients in 
study KN-051 (14/22, ~64%) were refractory to frontline chemotherapy. Overall, the studied population 
can be considered representative of real-world cHL paediatric patients, in particular adolescents, in an 
advanced setting of relapse. cHL is rarer in infants and children, which are indeed poorly or not at all 
represented in the studied population. Clinical benefit evaluations in these settings have to rely on 
extrapolation from the adult and adolescent setting. 
The ORR per IWG criteria observed in the 7 patients treated in the dedicated r/r cHL cohort was 42.9% 
(3/7), which is numerically lower than what observed in adults in pivotal study KN-204 (i.e. 65.6%). Two 
out of 7 subjects achieved a CR. Median DoR in this cohort was not reached due to limited follow-up (only 
one patient had an ongoing DoR ≥6 months). Median PFS in the r/r cHL cohort (11.2 months) was in line 
with that observed in study KN-204 (13.2 months), yet the estimated 12-month PFS rate was lower than 
that reported in adults (27.8% vs. 53.9%, respectively). The ORR per RECIST criteria was 66.7% (10/15 
with only one patient reaching a CR), with median DoR and PFS of 17.4 and 12.2 months, respectively. 
The actual clinical value of these results is, however, unknown because of the limited generalisability of 
RECIST responses in cHL. OS data are still immature to draw meaningful conclusions. 
With respect to the pooled population, higher ORR and CRR were observed with the Lugano criteria 
(54.5% [12/22] and 4.5% [1/22], respectively) compared to the IWG criteria (63.6% [14/22] and 18.2% 
[4/22], respectively), possibly reflecting the increased relevance of PET activity vs. TC lesion measures in 
the 2014 Lugano criteria. As in the adult setting, despite similar median PFS (8.3 and 8.2 months with 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 117/178 
 
 
  
  
the IWG 2007 and Lugano criteria, respectively) a significant difference in response duration was 
assessed when the IWG 2007 (17.3 months) and the Lugano criteria (8.8 months) were applied. Again, 
increased reliance on PET activity rather than dimensional increase of target lesions with the Lugano 
criteria might explain the shorter response duration. The provided KM curves failed to show any clear 
plateau, irrespectively of response criteria. 
The available efficacy data in paediatric patients with r/r cHL are limited (e.g. because of poor numbers, 
heterogeneity in response criteria, intrinsic difficulties in assessing time-to-event endpoints in uncontrolled 
studies and limited information on the possible impact of prognostic characteristics and prior treatments on 
the  results)  yet  overall  consistent  with  what  observed  in  adults  and,  in  principle,  supportive  of 
pembrolizumab  activity  in  this  subgroup.  The  totality  of  the  information  presented  provides  reliable 
evidence  to  support  the  extrapolation  approach  in  the  paediatric  cHL  population  3  years  old  and  above. 
Based on this, the MAH conducted a model-based bridging analysis to identify a dosing regimen that would 
provide exposures in paediatric patients similar to those in adults as described in this submission. 
In line with the framework proposed in the “Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development 
of  medicines  for  paediatrics”  the  MAH  has  applied  the  extrapolation  approach  based  on  the  following 
comparisons between adults and paediatrics 1) similarity of HL disease, 2) similar pharmacology of drug 
effect, 3) similar exposure-response for efficacy and safety. The totality of evidence allowed the MAH to 
conduct  a  model-based  bridging  analysis  to  identify  a  dosing  regimen  that  would  provide  exposures  in 
paediatric patients similar to those in adults. 
HL is recognized as a cancer that affects both children and adults. The disease has the same biology and 
natural history in both categories. HL has a bimodal age distribution, with peaks at 15 to 35 years of age 
and again after 50 years of age. While children younger than 14 years old have a higher incidence of nodular 
lymphocyte predominant HL, cHL is the most common histologic subtype similar to the adult population. 
Considering data on the incidence of HL in the paediatric population, children 3 years and older was used 
as an inclusion criteria in KEYNOTE-051. 
Classical HL is the population being studied in adult pembrolizumab clinical studies, where the median age 
of enrolled participants has been in their 30s. The continuity of cHL disease across patients younger than 
18 years of age and older than 18 years of age confers that it is essentially the same disease in children 
and adolescents as in adults. This is underscored by the same prognostic factors associated with success 
of therapy such as advanced stage disease, presence of B symptoms, bulky disease, ESR, haematocrit, and 
response to initial chemotherapy. Because of this, no difference in the mechanism of action and activity of 
pembrolizumab in this setting is expected to be observed between children and adults. 
Historically, treatment of cHL in childhood and adults generally utilized the same strategy and agents, with 
high cure rates especially in younger patients. Treatment of rrcHL similarly follows adult-based strategies, 
with multi-agent chemotherapy followed by myeloablative high-dose chemotherapy with auto-SCT. Front-
line  treatment  for  children  and  adolescents  with  cHL  is  highly  effective,  with  many  patients  essentially 
cured. However, children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cHL need improved therapies. Their 
currently available treatment options are typically more multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, including high 
dose therapy with auto-SCT. In patients who have previously been refractory to or relapsed from 1 or 2 
lines of chemotherapy, particularly those with high-risk disease, these existing treatment options are not 
satisfactory;  while  there  is  little  expectation  of  potential  benefit,  additional  toxicity  is  certain  and 
unavoidable.  The  other  option  at  that  point  is  investigational  agents  in  clinical  studies.  The  MAH  has 
identified a clear unmet medical need in this subset. 
The IL-2 release biomarker reflects the functional blockade of the PD-1 pathway by pembrolizumab and is 
utilized as a measure of target engagement - in support of a similar pharmacology drug effect;. Overall, 
even though the data in paediatric participants are limited, the estimates of IC50 values are similar between 
adults and paediatric participants.

Exposure-response  analysis  for  best  percent  change  from  baseline  tumor  size,  demonstrated  similar 
relationships between adult and paediatric participants with cHL. 
Efficacy in cHL paediatric patients is supported by extrapolation of efficacy data in adults (KEYNOTE-204, 
KEYNOTE-087). In addition, KEYNOTE-051 provides supportive efficacy data in cHL paediatric patients and 
safety data in paediatric patients with different tumor types. Overall, the evidence supports a positive B/R 
in the target population of children 3 years and older. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
Based on the available efficacy data, clinical benefit with pembrolizumab vs. BV is considered established 
for adult patients with r/r cHL who have failed 2nd line salvage chemotherapy +/- ASCT. 
Efficacy data in the paediatric setting are limited, however, when the rarity of cHL in the paediatric age 
and the consistent disease biology across age classes are taken into account, the available data can be 
considered adequate to confirm the activity of pembrolizumab in paediatric patients and support the 
proposed extrapolation strategy of results observed in the adult setting. 
Therefore, the indication was eventually revised to “KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the 
treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 3 years and older with relapsed or refractory classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma who have failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or following at least two prior 
therapies when ASCT is not a treatment option”. 
The final study report for study P204 is already included as a Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) in 
the Annex II; the deadline for the submission of the CSR has been extended to Q4 of 2025 in order for 
the MAH to generate OS data as requested by the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In the context of the extension of the currently approved therapeutic indication of pembrolizumab for the 
treatment  of  relapsed  or  refractory  classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma  (r/r  cHL)  in  adults  to  an  earlier  line  of 
therapy and to include paediatric patients, safety results have been presented by: 
• 
• 
• 
Indication Population, including overall 300 r/r cHL patients treated in the study KEYNOTE-204, a 
randomized,  open-label,  Phase  3  trial  evaluating  pembrolizumab  in  monotherapy  (KEYNOTE-204 
Pembrolizumab Safety Dataset; n=148 patients) versus Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) (KEYNOTE-204 
BV Safety Dataset; n=152 patients); 
cHL Safety Dataset for  Pembrolizumab, a pooled safety data from KEYNOTE  204 (148 patients), 
updated analysis of KEYNOTE-087 (210 patients) and KEYNOTE-013 cohort 3 (31 patients); 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset (RSD), a pooled population including overall 
5884 patients treated with pembrolizumab in monotherapy; this dataset consists of mostly solid 
tumour data and represents the established safety profile for pembrolizumab; 
•  Cumulative Safety Dataset (CSD), a pooled population including overall 8093 patients who received 
pembrolizumab in other studies, including cHL in KEYNOTE-013, KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-204. 
The CSD was provided only to show that no clinically meaningful change from the RSD occurred, 
supporting the consistency of the safety data of pembrolizumab across indications.

Patient exposure 
Demographic and other characteristics of Study Population in the different Safety Datasets are reported in 
Table  2.  Gender,  race  and  ECOG  performance  were  generally  similar  across  the  KEYNOTE-204  safety 
datasets,  the  cHL  Safety  Dataset  and  the  RSD.  Most  patients  were  male,  white  and  had  an  ECOG

performance status score of 0. However, differences in age and region were observed between the different 
datasets: in the KEYNOTE-204 and in the cHL Safety Dataset, the median age of patients was less than 
that in the RSD, and more than 80% of patients were <65 years old compared with 57.5% of patients in 
the RSD. Lower age is expected based on the epidemiology of cHL compared to solid tumors included in 
the RSD. In addition, in KEYNOTE-204, more patients in both arms (pembrolizumab and BV) were enrolled 
at ex-EU sites than in the cHL Safety Dataset (68.2% and 70.4% vs 56.8%), as observed for enrolment in 
the RSD (64.4%).

Protocol                                 
Safety results from participants treated with pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-204 was the primary focus of this 
submission. KEYNOTE-204 is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, open-label study of pembrolizumab (200 
mg Q3W) compared with BV (1.8 mg/kg Q3W) in participants with cHL. All participants had either failed 
treatment  that  included  auto-SCT  or  had  received  at  least  1  multi-agent  chemotherapy  regimen  if  they 
were not candidates for auto-SCT before enrolling in KEYNOTE-204. Participants who had received BV or 
BV containing regimen were enrolled in the study if they had responded (partial or complete) to the BV or 
BV-containing regimen. 
In KEYNOTE-204, the median exposure to pembrolizumab was twice as long as the median exposure to BV 
(10.02  months  vs  4.81  months).  Overall,  48%  (71/148)  of  participants  in  the  KEYNOTE-204  were  on 
treatment  for  ≥12  months,  with  a  median  of  15  administrations  compared  with  11.2%  (17/152)  of 
participants in the BV group on treatment for ≥12 months and a median of 7 administrations (Table 3b). 
The median duration of follow-up was 24.9 months (range: 1.8 to 42.0 months) in the pembrolizumab arm 
and  24.3  months  (range:  0.6  to  42.3  months)  in  the  BV  arm.  Median  exposure  to  pembrolizumab  was 
similar between the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm and the cHL Safety Dataset, in which 389 patients 
received  at  least  1  dose  of  pembrolizumab,  46.8%  (182/389)  remained  on  treatment  for  ≥12  months 
(median  of  10.65  months)  and  received  a  median  of  16  administrations.  In  the  RSD,  exposure  to 
pembrolizumab was lower (median of 4.86 months), with 21.8% of the participants on treatment for ≥12 
months and a median of 8 administrations.

Adverse events 
Safety and tolerability have been evaluated during the treatment period up to the cut-off date of 16-Jun-
2020 for KEYNOTE-204. Adverse events, occurred from the first dose up to 30 days after the last dose, 
were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 22.1 and graded according 
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03. 
Most AEs were of low-grade toxicity, as evidenced by the low rate of subjects with toxicity Grade 3 to 5 
drug-related  AEs  (62  [15.9%])  and  with  serious  drug-related  adverse  events  (46  [11.8%])  in  the  389-
subject cHL population (cHL Safety Dataset).  
In study KEYNOTE-204, some differences were observed in AEs between the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab 
safety dataset and the BV group, as the incidence of SAEs and the drug-related SAEs was higher in the 
pembrolizumab arm than in the BV group (SAEs 29.7% vs 21.1%, respectively; drug-related SAEs 16.2% 
vs 10.5%, respectively). However, when adjusted for exposure, the event rates for SAEs and drug-related 
SAEs were similar between groups, whereas the event rates for AEs and Grade 3 to 5 AEs were higher in 
the  BV  arm  than  in  the  KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  group.  Deaths  due  to  AEs  occurred  in  3  (2%) 
pembrolizumab participants vs 2 (1.3%) BV participants; for 1 (0.7%) pembrolizumab participant, death 
was reported as drug related, while none of the 2 BV death was attributed to the drug.

Table 67 Summary of Exposure-Adjusted Adverse Event  
In KEYNOTE-204, participants had received a median of 2 (range: 1 to 10) or 3 (range: 1 to 11) prior lines 
of therapy for pembrolizumab and BV, respectively, and the percentage of patients with primary refractory 
disease and prior auto-SCT was 40.4% and 37.1% in the pembrolizumab arm versus 40.5% and 36.6% in 
the BV arm. Prior use of BV was reported for 3.3% of patients in the pembrolizumab arm vs 6.5% in the 
BV group. Considering the inclusion criteria, a quite heterogeneous population in terms of prior exposure 
and response to previous therapy (including brentuximab, radiation therapy and auto-SCT), was enrolled 
in the KEYNOTE-204. As only 5 participants received prior BV in the pembrolizumab arm in KEYNOTE-204, 
comparison of AEs by prior BV status does not allow for a meaningful comparison.

The overall frequency and the type of AEs reported in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm were generally 
consistent with the cHL Safety Dataset. 
In comparison with the RSD and the CSD, the AEs that were most frequently reported (≥5 percentage point 
difference) in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm than in the RSD were: 
• 
pyrexia (19.6% vs 12.7% and 12.6%, respectively), hypothyroidism (18.9% vs 11.1% and 10.8%, 
respectively),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (18.9%  vs  6.6%  and  6.4%,  respectively)  and 
nasopharyngitis (11.5% vs 6.1 and 5.8%, respectively).

The  incidence  of  urinary  tract  infection  (10.8%)  reported  in  the  KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  arm  was 
higher than the cHL safety dataset (8%), the RSD (6.5%), the CSD (6.4%) and slightly higher compared 
to  the  incidence  of  urinary  tract  infection  (7.1%)  reported  in  KEYNOTE-087.  This  discrepancy  was  also 
observed for pneumonitis (8.8% in the pembrolizumab arm vs 6.9% in the cHL safety dataset, 4.1% in the

In  KEYNOTE-204,  the  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs  in  the  pembrolizumab  safety  dataset, 
compared with the BV arm, were hypothyroidism (15.5% vs 1.3%), pyrexia (12.8% vs 5.9%) and pruritus 
(10.8%  vs  5.3%).  Conversely,  the  BV  group  showed  higher  incidences  of  drug-related  neuropathy 
peripheral (2% vs 18.4%), nausea (4.1% vs 13.2%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (2% vs 13.2%).

Grade 3 to 5 Adverse Events 
The  overall  incidence  of  Grade  3  to  5  AEs  in  KEYNOTE-204  was  generally  similar  between  the 
pembrolizumab  arm  (43.9%)  and  the  BV  group  (43.4%).  In  the  KEYNOTE-204,  the  most  frequently 
reported Grade 3 to 5 AEs by decreasing incidence were as follows:  
•  pneumonia 
(5.4%),  anemia 
(4.1%),  pneumonitis 
(4.1%),  neutropenia 
(2.7%)  and 
thrombocytopenia (2.7%) for the pembrolizumab arm; 
• 
neutropenia (8.6%), neutrophil count decreased (4.6%), pneumonia (3.3%), anaemia (3.3%) and 
neuropathy peripheral (3.3%) in the BV group.

Drug-related Grade 3 to 5 Adverse Events 
Table  8  displays  the  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  Grade  3  to  5  drug-related  AEs  (incidence 
≥1%) in different safety datasets. The overall incidence of Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AEs in the KEYNOTE-
204  was  lower  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  (19.6%)  than  in  the  BV  group  (25%).  The  most  frequently 
reported drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs were: 
• 
• 
pneumonitis (4.1%), pneumonia (2%) and neutropenia (2%) in the pembrolizumab arm; 
neutropenia (7.2%), neutrophil count decreased (4.6%) and neuropathy peripheral (3.3%) in the 
BV arm. 
The Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AE reported more frequently was pneumonitis (4.1% in the KEYNOTE-204 
pembrolizumab arm vs 1.8% in the cHL Safety Dataset, 1.3% in the RSD and 1.2% in the CSD).

Acute kidney injury was reported more frequently as Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AE in the KEYNOTE-204 
pembrolizumab arm than in the cHL Safety Dataset, the RSD and the CSD (1.4%, 0.5%, 0.1% and 0.2%, 
respectively).  The  observed  imbalance  across  the  datasets  may  be  explained  by  the  longer  duration  of 
exposure  in  the  KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  arm  and  cHL  safety  dataset  (10.02  and  10.65  months, 
respectively) relative to the RSD and CSD (4.86 and 4.24 months, respectively. Of note, these percentages 
in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm and the cHL safety dataset are based on 2 participants in each 
group from populations of 148 and 389 participants, respectively.  These events were resolved. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The incidence of SAEs from 90 days of last dose in KEYNOTE-204 was higher for pembrolizumab compared 
with  BV  (29.7%  vs  21.1%),  but  the  rates  were  similar  after  adjustment  for  exposure.  Pneumonia, 
Pneumonitis  and  Pyrexia  were  most  frequently  reported  (incidence  ≥1%)  in  the  cHL  population  after 
pembrolizumab  (5.4%,  5.4%  and  2.7%,  respectively  in  the  KN-204  pembrolizumab  arm),  whereas 
pneumonia,  infusion  related  reaction,  pulmonary  embolism  and  neuropathy  peripheral  were  the  most 
frequent SAEs after BV (3.3%, 2%, 1.3% and 1.3%, respectively). 
Pneumonitis was the only most frequently reported SAE (≥ 2 percentage points difference) in the KEYNOTE-
204 pembrolizumab group than the other safety datasets (5.4% vs 3.3% in the cHL Safety Dataset, 2.0% 
in the RSD and 1.8% in the CSD).

Drug-related Serious Adverse Events 
In the KEYNOTE-204, the overall incidence of drug-related SAEs from 90 days of last dose was higher for 
pembrolizumab than BV (16.2% vs 10.5%) but the incidences were similar after adjustment for exposure. 
Pneumonitis was the only drug-related SAE more frequently reported (≥2 percentage points differences) in 
the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm than the cHL Safety dataset and the RSD (5.4% vs 3.3% and 1.9%, 
respectively)

Deaths due to adverse events 
The incidence of AEs resulting in death was low and comparable across the safety datasets. Deaths due to 
AEs in KEYNOTE-204 occurred in 3 patients (2%) in the pembrolizumab arm and in 2 BV patients (1.3%).

The narratives of 2 death cases from the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm were presented.  
In One patient the primary reported cause of death was pneumonia, considered related to pembrolizumab, 
but  interstitial  myocarditis,  interstitial  hepatitis,  and  tubulointerstitial  nephritis  were  also  noted  in  the 
autopsy report. The second subject died due to hypovolemic shock (Grade 5), considered not drug-related 
by the investigator; however the patient also presented with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, acute kidney 
injury, acute GVHD, and pneumonia at the time of death. The narrative for a patient who died due to an 
unknown cause, was also provided.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
Summary of Adverse Event of Special Interest 
The  summary  of  AEOSIs,  immune-mediated  events  and  infusion-related  reactions  associated  with 
pembrolizumab, are reported below.

Overall Adverse Event of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEOSI  was  comparable  between  the  KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  arm  (n=53, 
35.8%) and the cHL Safety Dataset (n=139, 35.7%), including those considered as drug-related (n=43, 
29.1% and n= 123, 31.6%, respectively), but with a slightly higher prevalence of serious-drug related AEs 
compared with the cHL Safety Datase (n=12, 8.1% vs n=22, 5.7% respectively). No deaths occurred in 
the KEYNOTE pembrolizumab arm or in the cHL Safety Dataset, related to a fatal AEOSI. 
Most  immune-mediated  AEOSIs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  were  managed  with  treatment 
interruptions and/or corticosteroids. At the time of the data cut-off, 50.9% of patients were reported to 
have  AEOSIs  resolved,  9.4%  were  resolving  and  37.7%  were  not  resolved  (most  AEOSIs  related  to 
endocrine abnormalities) in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm. 
In KEYNOTE-204, a higher incidence of AEOSIs was observed in the pembrolizumab arm compared with 
the  BV  group  (35.8%  vs  13.8%).  The  most  frequent  AEOSIs  were  hypothyroidism  (n=28  [18.9%]), 
pneumonitis (n=13 [8.8%]), and hyperthyroidism (n=8 [5.4%]) in the pembrolizumab arm, and infusion-
related reaction (n=12 [7.9]), hypothyroidism (n=4 [2.6%]), and pneumonitis (n=3 [2%]) in the BV arm.

Hypothyroidism 
In KEYNOTE-204, the most common AEOSI reported was hypothyroidism, which occurred in 28 patients 
(18.9%) in the pembrolizumab arm compared to 4 patients (2.6%) in the BV group. Of these, 23 patients 
(15.5%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  had  AEOSI  assessed  as  drug-related  and  were  Grade  1  or  2. 
Hypothyroidism was managed through observation and/or thyroid replacement hormone and no patients 
received corticosteroid treatment. Less than half of patients had a revolved or resolving status. 
In  KEYNOTE-204,  out  of  28  participants,  11  participants  had  a  past  medical  history  of  prior  radiation

therapy.  In  the  pembrolizumab  arm  of  KEYNOTE-204,  58  participants  had  received  prior  radiation  at 
baseline  while  93  participants  had  not  received  prior  radiation  in  the  ITT  population.  The  incidence  of 
hypothyroidism in participants who received prior radiation was thus 19.0% (11/58) compared to 18.3% 
(17/93) in participants who had not received prior radiation. TSH levels reported at baseline for these 28 
participants were as follows: 20 participants with normal, 7 participants with high and 1 participant with 
low TSH levels at baseline, respectively.

Pneumonitis 
In KEYNOTE-204, the overall incidence of pneumonitis was higher in the pembrolizumab arm than in the 
BV group (n=16, 10.8% vs n=4, 2.6%) and most cases were considered as drug-related (10.1% vs 1.3%). 
One-half of the patients (8/16) had Grade 3 or 4 events; no patients died due to pneumonitis. Pneumonitis 
was  more  frequent  than  observed  in  the  cHL  Safety  Dataset  (8%)  and  in  the  RSD  (4.5%),  but  it  was 
resolved for 12 out of 16 (75%) pembrolizumab patients in KEYNOTE-204, for 24 out of 31 patients (77.4%) 
in the cHL Safety Dataset and for 148 out of 264 patients (56.1%) in the RSD. The majority of patients 
were treated with systemic corticosteroid.

Infusion reactions 
The incidence of infusion reactions in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm was consistent with the cHL 
Safety Dataset and was more frequent than the RSD and the CSD. Infusion related reactions were more 
frequent in the cHL population (5.4% in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm, 7.9% in the BV group and 
8% in the cHL Safety Dataset) than in the RSD (2.3%) and the CSD (2.1%), characterized by a very earlier 
median time to first occurrence (1 day vs 44.5 in the RSD and 40 days in the CSD).

Laboratory findings 
In  KEYNOTE-204,  the  frequency  and  severity  of  laboratory  test  toxicity  were  comparable  in  the 
pembrolizumab and BV arms, in which most shifts in the toxicity Grade from baseline were to Grades ≤2. 
However,  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm,  shifts  to  Grade  3  or  4  were  observed  for  lymphocytes  decreased 
(Grade 3, n=6; 4.1% and Grade 4, n=7; 4.8%), alanine aminotransferase increased (Grade 3, n=8; 5.4%) 
and Grade 4, n=1; 0.7%), neutrophils decreased (Grade 3, n=8; 5.5% and Grade 4, n=4; 2.7%). Similar

In  KEYNOTE-204,  there  were  10  participants  in  each  treatment  group  (6.8%  and  6.6%  in  the 
pembrolizumab  and  BV  groups,  respectively)  who  experienced  “thrombocytopenia”  or  “platelet  count 
decreased” as reported by the sites as an AE. Among the 10 participants in the pembrolizumab group, 9 
participants had an event outcome reported as resolved, as of the data cut-off date. 
Among  these  10  participants  in  the  pembrolizumab  group,  Grade  1  events  were  experienced  by  4 
participants, and Grade 2, 3, and 4 events were experienced by 2 participants each. There were no events 
that led to clinical sequelae nor had a fatal outcome. Among participants in KEYNOTE-204, 12 were treated 
with platelet infusions: 7 (4.7%) in the pembrolizumab group and 5 (3.3%) in the BV group. Most platelet 
infusions  were  intended  for  treatment  of  thrombocytopenia.  Concomitant  medications  for  Grade  3-4 
thrombocytopenia for the 4 participants in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm were also provided.  
In  the  RSD,  excluding  the  243  cHL  participants  from  KEYNOTE-013  and  KEYNOTE-087,  a  total  of  140 
participants out of 5643 (2.5%) experienced thrombocytopenia or platelet count decreased. Of these, there 
were 100 participants with Grade 1 events, 20 with Grade 2 events, 9 with Grade 3 events, and 11 with 
Grade 4 events. There were no events that led to clinical sequelae nor had a fatal outcome. Less than 1%

(17/5643) of patients received a platelet transfusion after starting pembrolizumab. In addition, a case of 
autoimmune thrombocytopenia has been reported after treatment with pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-204.

No new immunogenicity data were available. 
Analysis of Secondary Malignancies 
There were no secondary malignancies identified in the KEYNOTE-204 or reported in the cHL Safety Dataset. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm, the incidence of AEs was generally higher among older patients 
(>=65), similar to the cHL Safety Dataset. This pattern was not observed between the age groups in the 
RSD and in the CRS.

The most commonly occurring AEs among participants ≥65 years (n=26) treated with pembrolizumab are 
provided in Table 76. Compared with participants <65 years of age treated with pembrolizumab (Table 77), 
participants  ≥65  years  of  age  had  higher  (>15  percentage  point  difference)  rates  of  peripheral  oedema 
(23.1%  vs  0.8%),  decreased  appetite  (23.1%  vs  2.5%),  and  pain  in  extremity  (23.1%  vs  5.7%)  (AE 
incidences <5% not shown in table). 
Slightly higher rates of AEs for some categories were also observed among older participants compared 
with younger participants in the BV arm of KEYNOTE-204 (e.g., Grade 3 to 5 AEs: 68.2% vs 39.2%) and 
the RSD (Grade 3 to 5 AEs: 53.0% vs 44.5%).

Gender 
In the pembrolizumab arm, the events observed in males versus females were as follows: 
•  Drug-related AEs in 59 (72.8%) males and 51 (76.1%) females; 
•  Grade 3 to 5 AEs in 34 (42.0%) males versus 31 (46.3%) females; 
•  SAEs in 21 (25.9%) males versus 23 (34.3%) females;

•  Discontinuations due to AEs in 8 (9.9%) males versus 12 (17.9%) females. 
This was generally consistent across the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm, the cHL Safety Dataset, and 
the RSD.

ECOG PS 
The incidence of AEs with pembrolizumab was similar between subjects with an ECOG performance status 
of 1 and an ECOG performance status of 0. Nevertheless drug-related AEs, Grade 3-5 AEs, deaths and SAEs 
were higher in subjects with ECOG PS 1. This was consistent across the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm, 
the cHL Safety Dataset and the RSD.

In KEYNOTE-204, 14 and 13 patients in the pembrolizumab and BV arms respectively, underwent allo-
SCT after stopping treatment. Of these, 12 (85.7%) in the pembrolizumab arm and 7 (53.8%) in the BV 
group  experienced  a  post  allo-SCT  AE.  The  most  common  AE  was  GVHD  for  8  patients  (57.1%)  in  the 
pembrolizumab arm (n=1 Grade 1, n=5 Grade 2, n=1 Grade 3, n=1 Grade 4) and for 5 patients (38.5%) 
in  the  BV  group  (n=1  Grade  2,  n=3  Grade  3,  n=1  Grade  4).  No  participants experienced hepatic  veno-
occlusive disease. 
Two patients, both in the pembrolizumab arm, died due to AEs: hypovolemic shock and hypoxic respiratory 
failure, both of which were reported by the MAH as not related to the study treatment. 
In KEYNOTE-087, 32 patients (15.2%) underwent allo-SCT; 20 of these patients experienced a post-allo-
SCT AE. The most common AE was GVHD (n=18): acute GVHD (n=11, including 1 hyperacute), chronic 
GVHD (n=2), or both (n=5). Eight patients had more than 1 event of GVHD (acute and/or chronic). Among 
the 30 events of GVHD, most events were Grade 1 (11 events), 13 were Grade 2, 4 were Grade 3 and 2 
were Grade 5. No participants experienced hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Four patients died due to post 
allo-SCT AEs: acute GVHD, hyperacute GVHD, pneumonia and sepsis (n=1 each). None was considered by 
the MAH related to the study treatment. 
In  KEYNOTE-051,  2  cHL  paediatric  patients  received  an  allo-SCT  after  treatment  with  pembrolizumab. 
Both patients developed a post allogeneic SCT complication: Grade 2 chronic GVHD in 1 patient and Grade 
2 acute GVHD in the other, approximately 4 months post-allogeneic SCT. At the time of the study, both 
patients were alive and the GVHD was not resolved. The investigators considered the chronic and acute 
GVHD as not related to pembrolizumab. 
For the 48 cHL participants in KEYNOTE-051, KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-204 who received an allo-SCT 
after on-study pembrolizumab, a summary of the time from the last dose of on-study pembrolizumab to 
allo-SCT  is  presented  for  the  overall  population  as  well  as  whether  the  participant  experienced  a  GVHD

(either acute or chronic) or not. Of note, there is one participant excluded in the analysis of time since last 
dose of pembrolizumab to first allo-SCT due to insufficient data in the date of the allo-SCT as the month of 
transplant  was  missing.  Also  in  KEYNOTE-051,  there  is  only  1  participant  in  the  analysis  with  GVHD 
compared  to  2  who  was  excluded  from  the  AE  summary  tables  because  the  onset  date  of  GVHD 
(12.01.2020) occurred after the data cut-off (10.01.2020). 
Table 982 Time to allo-SCT after the last dose of on-study pembrolizumab 
In  KEYNOTE-204,  additional  information  on  the  10  allo-SCT  participants  post-pembrolizumab  who 
experienced  a  GVHD  event  are  provided.  Also,  details  on  the  mortality  status  for  all  pembrolizumab 
participants receiving allo-SCT, where ‘transplant-related’ death was considered as any death that was not 
reported  as  progressive  disease,  is  provided  and  includes  additional  information  on  all  14  allo-SCT 
participants, such as the last known contact date and follow-up time since allo-SCT. These preliminary data 
confirm that GVHD is a frequent AE post pembrolizumab, especially as acute GVHD (reported 8 out of 11 
patients, including the subject excluded from the analysis), Grade 2 or Grade 3 predominantly. However, 
also  chronic  GVHD  mild/moderate/severe  has  been  observed  (in  3  out  of  11  patients).  Of  the  fourteen 
transplanted patients, two patients died, and the cause of death was respiratory failure and hypovolaemic 
shock, respectively. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies have been performed. However, as pembrolizumab is an 
IgG antibody administrated parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food and DDI are not able to 
influence exposure, and drugs that affect cytochrome P450 enzymes are not expected to interfere with 
the metabolism of pembrolizumab. Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with 
pembrolizumab have not been conducted. However, the use of systemic corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressive drugs should be avoided because of their potential interference with the 
pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of pembrolizumab, although these drugs can be used to treat 
immune-related adverse reactions during the pembrolizumab treatment.

The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  in  KEYNOTE-204  was  similar  for  the 
pembrolizumab  and  BV  groups  (13.5%  vs  17.8%),  with  the  exception  of  neuropathy  peripheral  (0% 
pembrolizumab,  5.3%  BV),  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (0%  pembrolizumab,  3.9%  BV),  and 
pneumonitis (6.1% pembrolizumab, 0% BV). The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was lower in 
the pembrolizumab arm respect to the BV group, after adjustment for exposure (1.03 vs 2.80 events/100 
person-months). The overall incidence of AEs leading to pembrolizumab discontinuation in KEYNOTE-204 
was consistent with the cHL Safety Dataset and the RSD, except for pneumonitis (6.1% in KEYNOTE-204 
pembrolizumab arm, 4.4% in the cHL Safety Dataset and 1.6% in the RSD). 
Table 993 Subjects with adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation (the most 
frequent AEs leading to treatment discontinuation) 
Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
Drug-related  AEs  that  resulted  in  treatment  discontinuation  were  reported  in  12.8%  of  patients  in  the 
pembrolizumab arm and in 16.4% of patients in the BV group. The incidence of drug-related AEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation was similar except for neuropathy peripheral (0% pembrolizumab, 5.3% BV), 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (0% pembrolizumab, 3.9% BV) and pneumonitis (6.1% pembrolizumab, 0% 
BV).  The  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  lower  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm 
compared with BV group, after adjustment for exposure (0.98 vs 2.52 events/100 person-months). The 
overall incidence of drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation was higher than in the cHL Safety Dataset 
and the RSD (12.8% in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm, 9.3% in the cHL Safety dataset and 7% in 
the  RSD).  Pneumonitis  was  the  only  drug-related  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  with  a  greater  than  2 
percentage point difference in KEYNOTE-204 compared with the RSD (6.1% vs 1.6%).

Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Interruption 
The incidence of AEs leading to treatment interruption was similar in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab and 
BV  arms  (29.7%  vs  33.6%).  The  most  frequent  AEs  leading  to  treatment  interruption  were  pneumonia 
(3.4%)  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (3.4%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm,  neuropathy  peripheral 
(5.9%) and infusion-related reactions (4.6%) in the BV arm. The incidence of AEs leading to interruption 
of pembrolizumab was consistent between KEYNOTE-204, the cHL safety dataset and the RSD.

Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Interruption 
Drug-related AEs leading to dose interruption occurred in 18.9% of patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 
in  28.9%  of  patients  in  the  BV  group.  Diarrhea  (n=3,  2%),  AST  increased  (n=3,  2%)  and  pneumonitis 
(n=3, 2%) were the most common AEs leading to dose interruption in the pembrolizumab arm; neuropathy 
peripheral  (n=9,  5.9%),  infusion  reaction  (n=7,  4.6%)  and  neutropenia  (n=4,  2.6%)  were  the  most 
common  AEs  in  the  BV  arm  (Table  31).  The  incidence  and  types  of  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  the 
interruption of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-204 were consistent with the cHL Safety Dataset and the RSD.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
To support the safety of pembrolizumab (2mg/kg Q3W) in the paediatric population, long-term data from 
KEYNOTE-051 were presented. KEYNOTE-051 is an ongoing, 2-part Phase 1-2, nonrandomized, open-label, 
single  arm  in  paediatric  population  (aged  between  6  months  to  <18  years)  with  advanced  melanoma, 
relapsed or refractory, PD-L1-positive malignant solid tumours, or cHL (the 22 participants with HL ranged 
in age from 10 to 17 years: four participants were 10 to 13 years of age and 18 participants were 14 to 17 
years of age). A total of 162 paediatric patients were enrolled, 161 of whom (22 with cHL) received at least 
1 dose of pembrolizumab. 
At the cut-off date (10.01.2020), the median duration of exposure to pembrolizumab was 8-fold-longer for 
cHL patients (344 days) compared with patients with other tumours (43 days), with a median number of 
17  pembrolizumab  administrations  in  cHL  patients  vs  3  administrations  in  participants  with 
relapsed/refractory tumours other than cHL. The percentage of patients who received pembrolizumab for 
≥6 months and ≥12 months was 3-4-fold higher in cHL than the other patients (72.7% and 40.9% in cHL 
patients vs 18% and 12.9% in the others participants). The median duration of follow-up was approximately 
3-fold longer for participants with cHL (23.7 months, range 4-43.2 months) than for participants with all 
other tumors types (8.3 months, range 0.4-56 months), primarily due to the large number of early deaths 
among the other tumour types.

The  types  and  incidences  of  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  in  KEYNOTE-051  were  consistent  with  a 
heavily  pre-treated  paediatric  population  with  advanced  cancers.  Although  the  majority  of  participants 
(57.8%) had treatment-related AEs, the proportions of participants with Grade 3 to 5 treatment-related 
AEs  was  8.7%,  with  treatment-related  SAEs  was  9.9%,  and  with  treatment-related  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation of study treatment was 3.7%. 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  (≥20%  of  participants)  were  pyrexia  (32.9%),  vomiting  (29.8%), 
headache (25.5%), abdominal pain (22.4%), anaemia (21.1%), cough (20.5%), and constipation (19.9%), 
the majority of them with Grade 1-2 toxicity.

Table 106 Subjects with Serious Adverse Events by Decreasing Incidence Up to 90 Days from 
Last Dose (Incidence ≥ 1%) (All Subjects as Treated Population - Parts I and II) 
The most frequently reported treatment related SAEs (>1% of participants) were pyrexia in 4 participants 
(2.5%), hypertension in 2 participants (1.2%), and pleural effusion in 2 participants (1.2%). 
Death: five participants (3.1%) had 1 or more AEs that resulted in death up to 90 days after receiving the 
last  dose  of  pembrolizumab.  Two  participants  had  fatal  AEs  reported  by  the  investigator  as  treatment 
related: 1 participant had pulmonary edema and 1 participant had pneumonitis and pleural effusion. The 
fatal, treatment-related AE of pulmonary edema occurred in a participant experiencing concomitant sepsis. 
The fatal, treatment-related AEs of pneumonitis and pleural effusion occurred in a participant with extensive 
right chest involvement of the underlying epithelioid sarcoma. 
One participant with a primary diagnosis of solid tumour NOS developed a secondary malignancy of Grade 
5  adenocarcinoma  gastric,  reported  by  the  investigator  as  not  treatment  related.  No  other  secondary 
malignancies were identified. 
Two out of 4 participants with MSI-H solid tumours had a serious neurologic AE during the first 2 treatment 
cycles.  Both  SAEs  (seizure  and  myoclonus)  were  reported  as non-treatment  related by  the investigator, 
and no action was taken with pembrolizumab in response to the events. 
AEOSIs: thirty (18.6%) participants had at least 1 AEOSI. The most frequently reported AEOSI (in ≥2.5% 
of  participants)  were  hypothyroidism  (8.1%),  hyperthyroidism  (3.7%),  hypersensitivity  (2.5%),  and 
pneumonitis (2.5%). Four (2.5%) participants had a Grade 3 to 5 AEOSI: 3 participants with a Grade 3 
AEOSI  (colitis,  myelitis,  and  pruritus)  and  1  participant  with  Grade  5  pneumonitis.  The  AEOSIs  were 
manageable  with  standard  therapeutic  strategies  or  concomitant  corticosteroids  and  among  the  30 
participants who had at least 1 AEOSI, 13 (43.3%) participants had resolution of an event by the time of 
data cutoff. 
Treatment  with  pembrolizumab  was  well  tolerated;  most  AEs  did  not  lead  to  treatment  interruption. 
Among the 21 (13.0%) participants who had at least 1 AE resulting in treatment interruption, the most 
common AE and drug-related AE was alanine aminotransferase increased in 3 (1.9%) participants.

An update on immunological analyses has been also provided by the MAH for paediatric cHL patients 
included  in  KEYNOTE-051.  Vaccinated  antibody  concentrations  and  memory  B-  and  T-cell  counts  were 
collected  as  part  of  the  secondary  objectives  of  KEYNOTE-051.  Analyses  of  pooled  KEYNOTE-051 
participants indicate an upward trend from pre-treatment to post-treatment Cycle 4 in memory B- and T-
cell counts through. Minimal changes were observed in the concentration of vaccinated antibodies from pre-
treatment to post-treatment Cycle 4. 
In  KEYNOTE-051,  3  patients  received  an  allo-SCT  after  treatment  with  pembrolizumab  (2  paediatric 
patients  with  cHL).  One  cHL  patient  was  treated  with  pembrolizumab  for  12  weeks,  then  discontinued 
treatment while continuing to receive an “immune checkpoint blockade” (but the name and duration were 
unknown).  The  allo-SCT  was  performed  11  months  after  stopping  the  pembrolizumab  treatment. 
Approximately 4 months post-allogeneic SCT, the patient developed a Grade 2 chronic GVHD; the patient 
was alive, approximately 10 months after allo-SCT.  
The other cHL patient underwent allo-SCT after receiving treatment with pembrolizumab (30 doses). On 
Day 644, the patient discontinued pembrolizumab and on Day 736 (about after 3 months of interruption) 
had  an  allo-SCT.  GVHD  prophylaxis included  anti-thymocyte  immunoglobulin and  methotrexate.  On  Day 
846, the patient developed a Grade 2 acute GVHD, treated with steroid; at the cut-off date, the patient was 
alive, but acute GVHD was not resolved. The investigator considered the chronic and acute GVHD as not 
related to pembrolizumab. 
No additional participants in KEYNOTE-051 have received an allo-SCT after the cut-off data (10 Jan 2020). 
Comparison of cHL paediatric safety data to cumulative paediatric safety data: 
AEs  among  participants  with  rrcHL  and  other  tumour  types  in  KEYNOTE-051,  are  provided  by  key 
categories: overall AE summary (Table 79), and overall summary of AEOSI. The data provided by the MAH 
showed that the patients with cHL had higher rates of drug-related AEs and dose modifications due to AEs 
compared with other tumour types while participants with other tumor types had higher rates of Grade 3-
5 AEs and SAEs. They experienced higher rates of overall AEOSI and drug-related AEOSI compared with 
participants  with  other  tumor  types.  Nevertheless,  the  duration  of  exposure  to  pembrolizumab  was 
approximately 8-fold longer for participants in KEYNOTE-051 with cHL. 
Comparison of cHL paediatric safety data to the cHL safety profile in adults: 
While  the  number  of  cHL  participants  in  KEYNOTE-051  is  small  (N=22),  a  comparison  of  AE  rates  in 
KEYNOTE-051  versus  cHL  participants  in  KEYNOTE-204  and  the  cHL  Safety  Dataset  shows  consistently 
lower rates for all AE categories in the KEYNOTE-051 cHL dataset (except for AEOSI).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In  the  context  of  extension  of  the  currently  approved  therapeutic  indication  of  pembrolizumab  for  the 
treatment  of  relapsed  or  refractory  classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma  (rrcHL)  in  adults,  to  an  earlier  line  of 
therapy and to include paediatric patients, safety results have been presented from study KEYNOTE-204, 
evaluating pembrolizumab in monotherapy versus Brentuximab Vedotin (BV), in parallel to the cHL Safety 
Dataset, the Reference Safety Dataset (RSD) and the Cumulative Safety Dataset (CSD). To support the 
extension  of  the  indication  to  rrcHL  paediatric  patients,  safety  data  from  KEYNOTE-051  have  been  also 
provided. KEYNOTE-087 was the pivotal study supporting the initial rrcHL indication in the adults. In order 
to evaluate potential differences in the pembrolizumab safety profile, the updated data from KEYNOTE-013 
and  KEYNOTE-087  have  been  presented  separately  from  the  overall  cHL  Safety  Dataset,  and  the  safety 
analysis from these studies have been compared with KEYNOTE-204. Some differences were observed in 
AEs  between  the  KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  safety  dataset  and  the  study  KEYNOTE-087,  as  the 
incidence of SAEs and drug-related SAEs was higher in KN-204 than in the KN-087 (SAEs 29.7% vs 22.9%, 
respectively; drug-related SAEs 16.2% vs 8.1%, respectively). However, when adjusted for exposure, the 
event rates were similar. Analysis of AEOSIs revealed a similar incidence (<5% difference) for all categories, 
including Grade 3 to 5 events, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation. The overall AE profile observed in 
the  KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  arm  was  generally  consistent  with  KEYNOTE-013  for  both overall  AEs 
and AEOSIs, except for a higher incidence of SAEs in KEYNOTE-013 than in KEYNOTE-204 (SAEs 38.7% vs 
29.7%, respectively). However, in agreement with the MAH, differences observed for some categories (all 
≤10%) are likely due to small participant numbers in KEYNOTE-013 (n=31) and should be interpreted with 
caution. In conclusion, when comparing the safety data of KEYNOTE-204 with KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-
013, no significant differences emerged for using pembrolizumab across this cHL patient population.  
In line with the Hodgkin lymphoma, the Indication Population was younger compared to the RSD and the 
CSD, with a median age of 35.5 years (vs. 62 years in the other safety datasets). This population was quite 
heterogeneous  in  terms  of  prior  exposure  and  response  to  previous  therapy  (in  median  2  prior  lines  of 
therapy, range 1-10 in pembrolizumab arm), including previous BV or auto-SCT. In terms of prior exposure 
and response to previous therapy, the MAH underlined that: i) comparison of AEs by prior BV status does 
not allow for a meaningful comparison, as only 5 participants received prior BV in the pembrolizumab arm 
in  KEYNOTE-204;  ii)  rates  of  AEs  were  generally  similar  between  participants  with  and  without  prior 
radiation; iii) most categories of AEs occurred at similar rates, when examined by prior auto-SCT status, 
although a higher percentage of participants with prior auto-SCT experienced SAEs (38.2% vs 24.7%), but 
the  percentage  of  participants  experiencing  drug-related  SAEs  was  similar  (18.2%  vs  15.1%);  iv) 
participants with one prior line of therapy experienced fewer Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AEs compared with 
participants with 2 lines or 3 or more lines of therapy; v) although the subgroup analyses were notable for 
some numerical differences within several AE sub-categories (i.e., age [<65 vs ≥65 years; <65 vs ≥65 to 
<75 vs ≥75 to<85 years], gender, race, ECOG status and region [North America vs Europe vs Japan; US 
vs non-US; EU vs non-EU]), the smaller number of participants within these subgroups does not allow for 
a meaningful comparison and no definitive conclusion can be drawn. 
In terms of exposure to pembrolizumab, a longer median time on therapy was reported for cHL patients 
compared to the RSD and the CSD (10.02 months in the KN-204 pembrolizumab arm and 10.65 months in 
the cHL Safety Dataset vs 4.86 months in the RSD and 4.24 months in the CSD), with a higher number of 
doses administered (15 doses in KN-204 and 16 doses in the cHL Safety Dataset vs 8 doses in the RSD and 
7 doses in the CSD). Overall, 67.6% of cHL population in KN-204 (n=100) were exposed to pembrolizumab 
for at least 6 months (vs 32.2%, n=49 in BV arm) and safety data with treatment exposure ≥12 months 
were available for 71 patients (48%) for pembrolizumab (vs only 17 patients, 11.2% in the BV group).

In general, pembrolizumab was well tolerated among subjects with cHL. Most AEs were of low-Grade toxicity 
as evidenced by the low rate of subjects with toxicity Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AEs (62 [15.9%]) and with 
serious drug-related adverse events (46 [11.8%]) in the 389-subject cHL population.  
The  overall  AE  profile  in  the  KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  group  was  generally  consistent  with  the  cHL 
Safety Dataset, except for such categories of AES (SAEs, drug-related SAEs, Grade 3 to 5 AEs and drug-
related Grade 3 to 5 AEs). The incidence of Grade 3 to 5 AEs generally differed by less than 2 percentage 
points between the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm and the cHL Safety Dataset, except for the observed 
rate of pneumonitis (4.1% vs 1.8%, respectively). The only Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AE and SAE reported 
more frequently (≥2 percentage points difference) in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm than in the 
cHL Safety Dataset was pneumonitis (Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AE 4.1% vs 1.8%; SAE 5.4% vs 3.3%, 
respectively). The frequency and type of drug-related SAEs reported in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab 
arm were generally consistent with the cHL Safety Dataset, generally differing by less than 1 percentage 
point except for pneumonitis (5.4% vs 3.3%) and pneumonia (2.0% vs 0.8%). 
Patients  enrolled  in  KEYNOTE-204  had  relapsed  or  refractory  disease  and  were  heavily  pre-treated  with 
chemotherapeutic agents that have a known association with pulmonary toxicities, including prior radiation 
exposure,  bleomycin  (a  prior  treatment  in  89.2%  of  participants  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  has  been 
reported),  and  melphalan  in  those  participants  who  underwent  previous  SCT.  These  findings  may  have 
contributed  to  the  observed  high  rate  of  pneumonitis,  a  known  immune-related  event,  in  KEYNOTE-204 
patients who received pembrolizumab. As these heavily pre-treated patients have all weakened immune 
systems, opportunistic infections, including pneumonia, might be a risk. 
However, after adjustment for exposure, event rates in the KEYNOTE-204 and cHL Safety Dataset were 
similar for all AE categories. 
In Keynote-204, the AEs with a notable risk difference included hypothyroidism and urinary tract infection 
in the pembrolizumab arm, and peripheral neuropathy, nausea and peripheral sensory neuropathy in the 
BV arm. These AEs were consistent with the established safety profiles of pembrolizumab in monotherapy 
and BV. An exception was noted for urinary tract infection and for pneumonitis with higher incidence in the 
KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  arm  than  the  other  datasets.  While  no  definitive  explanation  for  the 
imbalance  observed  between  the  safety  datasets  was  identified,  the  higher  incidence  of  urinary  tract 
infection observed in the pembrolizumab arm may be partly explained by the slightly higher proportion of 
females  in  the  KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  arm  relative  to  the  RSD  and  the  CSD  (45.3%,  33.9%  and 
33.1%  respectively).  Women  are  more  prone  to  urinary  infections  than  men.  Additionally,  the  higher 
incidence of urinary tract infection could be also related to the median duration of exposure in the KEYNOTE-
204  pembrolizumab  arm,  twice  as  long  compared  with  the  RSD  and  the  CSD  (10.02  vs  4.86  and  4.24 
months, respectively). Similarly, the higher rates of pneumonitis in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm 
than those observed in cHL safety dataset, RSD and CSD (8.8%, 6.9%, 4.1% and 3.8% respectively) may 
also  be  explained  by  the  median  duration  of  exposure  and/or  by  prior  radiation/melphalan/bleomycin 
exposure  in  patients  in  KEYNOTE-204  who  received  pembrolizumab,  as  these  agents  all  have  a  known 
association with pulmonary toxicity 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm,  compared  with  the  BV  arm, 
were hypothyroidism (15.5% vs 1.3%), pyrexia (12.8% vs 5.9%) and pruritus (10.8% vs 5.3%), whereas 
the  BV  group  showed  higher  incidences  of  drug-related  neuropathy  peripheral  (2%  vs  18.4%),  nausea 
(4.1% vs 13.2%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (2%  vs 13.2%). The incidence and types of drug-
related AEs reported in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab safety dataset were generally consistent with the 
other datasets, except for pyrexia and hypothyroidism. This could be expected because pyrexia is a common 
B symptom associated with cHL and an increased risk of hypothyroidism could be due to previous treatment 
with radiation therapy. Also, acute kidney injury was reported more frequently as Grade 3 to 5 drug-related 
AE in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm than in the cHL Safety Dataset, the RSD and the CSD (1.4%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021

0.5%, 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively). Of note, the percentages in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm 
and  the  cHL  safety  dataset  were  based  on  2  patients  in  each  group  from  populations  of  148  and  389 
participants,  respectively.  Details  on  these  patients  have  been  provided  by  the  MAH.  Both  participants’ 
clinical courses were marked by numerous AEs that developed concurrently with acute kidney injury. In 
both cases, the events of acute kidney injury were treated and resulted in resolution. Acute kidney injury 
is a known immune-related AE of pembrolizumab. Renal adverse events with PD
1 inhibitors consist mainly 
‐
of  elevated  serum  creatinine  levels,  and  nephritis  has  been  reported  in  0.3%–1.2%  of  patients  across 
clinical trials (Vardhana S et al. The Oncologist 2019;24:86–95). In agreement with the MAH, the observed 
imbalance across the datasets may be explained by the longer duration of exposure in the KEYNOTE-204 
pembrolizumab arm and cHL safety dataset (10.02 and 10.65 months, respectively) compared with RSD 
and CSD (4.86 and 4.24 months, respectively). 
SAEs were consistent across population, with pneumonia (5.4%), pneumonitis (5.4%) and pyrexia (2.7%) 
most frequently reported. Pneumonitis was the only more frequently reported SAE (≥2 percentage points 
difference)  in  the  KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  group  than  the  other  safety  datasets,  for  which  the 
contribution of the immune dysregulation induced by lymphoma cannot be excluded. 
Deaths due to AEs in KEYNOTE-204 occurred in 3 patients (2%) in the pembrolizumab arm and in 2 BV 
patients (1.3%), compared with 6 (1.5%) patients in the cHL Safety Dataset and 312 (5.3%) patients in 
the  RSD.  One  death  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  of  KEYNOTE-204  was  attributed  to  drug-related  AE  of 
pneumonia. More details have been required for all participants in KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm who 
died due to AEs, also providing the narrative of death that occurred in the third patient. In the case of one 
participant, although autopsy confirmed that pneumonia was the primary cause of death with microbiology 
positive  for  E.coli,  diagnostic  imaging  was  suggestive  of  pneumonitis,  for  which  related  relation  to 
pembrolizumab,  as  AEOSI,  cannot  be  excluded.  In  addition,  during  the  clinical  course,  the  patient  was 
treated with antibiotics and steroids that did not result in clinical improvement and, therefore, the exact 
aetiology of the pulmonary compromise is not clear. Similarly,  for the AE of cardiac failure (reported as 
myocarditis),  without  information  on  the  clinical  status  at  baseline  and  with  only  an  echocardiogram 
revealing  an  aortic  and  mitral  valve  disease,  it  is  difficult  to  understand  the  exact  aetiology  of  such 
myocarditis.  However,  the  prior  oncology  treatment  history  included  treatment  with  doxorubicin  and 
bleomycin that could be a potential contributing factor to the reported cardiac failure and pneumonitis.  
For another participant, in agreement with the MAH, the AEs including acute GVHD, autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia and infections should be considered as complications associated with stem cell transplant. 
The narrative for the third participant, who died due to an unknown cause, was also provided. However, 
for this case, the insufficient clinical information provided do not allow to assess a potential causal role for 
pembrolizumab and the reported events. 
The incidence of AEOSI in the cHL population in KEYNOTE-204 has been reported as comparable to that in 
the cHL Safety Dataset (35.8% and 35.7%, respectively) but higher compared to the RSD (25.1%) and to 
the  CSD  (24.4%),  which  could  be  due  to  longer  exposure  and  follow-up.  In  KEYNOTE-204,  the  most 
frequent AEOSIs were hypothyroidism (n=28 [18.9%]), pneumonitis (n=16 [10.8%]), and hyperthyroidism 
(n=8  [5.4%])  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm;  infusion-related  reaction  (n=12  [7.9]),  hypothyroidism  (n=4 
[2.6%]),  and  pneumonitis  (n=3  [2%])  in  the  BV  arm.  Most  immune-mediated  AEOSIs  were  mild  to 
moderate in severity and were managed with treatment interruptions and/or corticosteroids.  
Hypothyroidism was the most frequently observed AEOSI across populations. The higher rate of events in 
cHL patients (Grade 1 and 2), as well as the shorter time to onset of the first hypothyroidism event can be 
justified by the frequent prior exposure to mediastinal radiation therapy. None of the events was treated 
with  corticosteroids.  In  the  pembrolizumab  arm  of  KEYNOTE-204,  58  participants  had  received  prior 
radiation at baseline while 93 participants had not received prior radiation in the ITT population. Considering 
that an AEOSI of hypothyroidism occurred in 28 (18.9%) patients in the pembrolizumab arm and, of these 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 161/178 
 
 
  
  
28  participants,  11  patients  had  a  past  medical  history  of  prior  radiation  therapy,  the  incidence  of 
hypothyroidism in participants who received prior radiation was 19.0% (11/58) compared to 18.3% (17/93) 
in participants who had not received prior radiation. The TSH levels reported at baseline were normal for 
20  out  of  28  patients,  high  for  7  patients  and  low  for  1  patient,  suggesting  that  a  pre-existing 
hypothyroidism  was  not  present  for  the  majority  of  these  patients.  The  longer  duration  of  exposure  for 
patients in KEYNOTE-204 may also explain the higher overall incidence of hypothyroidism compared to the 
RSD.  
No major differences specific for the cHL population were observed in terms of events outcome, except for 
a higher rate of patients with a resolved status in the cHL Safety Dataset (40.9%) compared to the patients 
in the KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm (28.6%). A clarification has been provided by the MAH to explain 
the higher rate of hypothyroidism with unresolved status in KEYNOTE-204: the longer duration of follow-
up in KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-087 (included in cHL Safety Dataset) allowed for additional information 
to be collected on the complete clinical course with respect to the outcome of events, in contrast to the 
shorter  duration  of  follow-up  in  KEYNOTE-204  that  may  explain  the  higher  rate  of  hypothyroidism  with 
unresolved  status.  An  additional  aspect  to  consider  regarding  the  resolution  status  may  be  related  to 
medical judgment: while some investigators may consider an event resolved once the participant is stable 
on  thyroid  hormone  replacement,  others  may  consider  the  event  unresolved  since  the  requirement  for 
treatment is still present. However, overall experience with pembrolizumab and hypothyroidism indicates 
that  physician  monitoring  and  thyroid  hormone  replacement  are  sufficient  to  manage  this  risk  without 
requiring discontinuation of therapy and for this reason, the MAH’s conclusion is endorsed. 
Sixteen (10.8%) participants experienced an AEOSI of pneumonitis in the pembrolizumab arm compared 
to 4 (2.6%) in the BV arm. The incidence of pneumonitis and the characteristics of events, in terms of time 
to onset, duration and type of outcome, were as expected, considering that the prior radiation exposure 
and  the  use  of  bleomycin  may  be  contributing  factors  for  the  observed  incidence  of pneumonitis  in  cHL 
population.  The  majority  of  pneumonitis  events  were  Grade  3  and  below  and  resolved  with  systemic 
corticosteroids. There were no fatal events of pneumonitis. 
Infusion related reactions were more frequent in the cHL population, especially in the BV arm (5.4% in the 
KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm, 7.9% in the BV group and 8% in the cHL Safety Dataset) than in the 
RSD (2.3%) and the CSD (2.1%), characterized by a very earlier median time to first occurrence (1 day in 
KN-204  vs  44.5  in  RSD  and  40  days  in  CSD).  The  majority  of  infusion  reaction  events  did  not  require 
corticosteroid treatment.  
Changes  in  laboratory  findings  in  the  cHL  population  were  in  line  with  those  reported  in  the  larger  cHL 
datasets, mostly related with Hodgkin lymphoma and prior anti-lymphoma treatment. Further investigation 
has  been  requested  on  potential  immunogenicity  related  to  pembrolizumab,  particularly  with  respect  to 
ANA, ASMA and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Rheumatic and/or systemic irAEs may occur across 
all  classes  of  check  point  inhibitor  (CPI),  including  pembrolizumab,  most  frequently  and  severely  with 
combination treatments and may be associated with other organ-specific irAEs. Since autoantibodies are 
not found in the majority of patients experiencing CPI-induced rheumatic and systemic disease, there is no 
indication to test every patient at baseline. More generally, the pre-existing antinuclear antibodies revealed 
no  significant  difference  in  the  development  of  irAEs  between  the  positive  and  negative  ANA  groups 
(Sakaklda T et al. Clinical and Translation Oncology 2020).  In the absence of clinical biomarkers predicting 
the occurrence of irAEs after use of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade for cancer immunotherapy, in line with the EULAR 
recommendation  (Kostine  M  et  al.  Ann  Rheum  Dis  2020),  the  detection  of  autoantibodies  in  an 
asymptomatic patient would not preclude the start of CPI therapy. However, there is the particular situation 
of patients with thymoma who develop CPI-induced myositis and who all have anti-acetylcholine receptor 
and antistriated muscle antibodies detected in serum sample obtained prior to CPI therapy (Mammen AL et 
al. Ann Rheum Dis 2019). Accordingly, as myositis may evolve into a severe irAE, testing for the presence 
of these antibodies before starting CPI in a patient with thymoma is recommended to identify a high risk of

myositis (Kostine M et al. Ann Rheum Dis 2020). To date, the MAH’ explanation that there is no rationale 
for the screening or long-term monitoring of autoimmunity (e.g. ANA, ANCA, ASMA) prior to treatment with 
pembrolizumab is accepted.  
The  MAH  has  also  focused  on  laboratory  data  pertaining  to  “platelet  count  decreased”  or 
“thrombocytopenia”  that  are  reported  as  AEs  for  which  clinically  meaningful  data  including  outcome, 
treatments  received,  and  clinical  sequelae  were  presented.  In  KEYNOTE-204,  the  incidence  of 
“thrombocytopenia”  or  “platelet  count  decreased”  were  6.8%  and  6.6%  in  the  pembrolizumab  and  BV 
groups,  respectively,  compared  to  the  RSD  in  which  a  total  of  140  participants  out  of  5643  (2.5%) 
experienced these AEs. Based on the data provided, no evidence of significant concern on laboratory data 
pertaining  to  “platelet  count  decreased”  or  “thrombocytopenia”  as  AEs  was  highlighted  during  the 
pembrolizumab treatment for the cHL patient population. Myelosuppression is a common toxicity associated 
with cytotoxic chemotherapy, but thrombocytopenia as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) commonly 
occur during the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) (Delanoy N et al. Lancet Haematol. 
2019).  In  the  KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  arm,  all  four  participants  were  treated  for  Grade  3-4 
thrombocytopenia,  including  one  participant  who  received  systemic  corticosteroids  and  no  participants 
received  immunoglobulin.  In  addition,  a  case  of  autoimmune  thrombocytopenia  was  reported  after 
treatment  with  pembrolizumab  in  KEYNOTE-204.  However,  in  this  case,  the  assessment  for 
thrombocytopenia  is  confounded  by  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  in  the  setting  of  patient’s 
underlying  progressive  malignant  disease  that  are  considered  as  risk  factors  for  thrombocytopenia.  In 
conclusion,  the  management  by  platelet  transfusion  is  a  main  issue  in  patients  with  severe 
thrombocytopenia  secondary  to  cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  whereas  systemic  steroid  and  immunoglobulin 
administration is identified as a reasonable choice in those, due to immunotherapy. The use of systemic 
corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting pembrolizumab should be avoided because of their 
potential  interference  with  the  pharmacodynamic  activity  and  efficacy  of  pembrolizumab.  However, 
systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting pembrolizumab to treat 
immune-related adverse reactions, as reported in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
No major and unexpected differences in the tolerability of pembrolizumab treatment were observed across 
the  different  ECOG  PS  categories,  while  an  increased  rate  of  drug-related  AEs  was  observed  in  females 
compared to males (76.1% vs 72.8%). The Grade 3-5 AEs and the SAEs were slightly higher in the female 
population  and  the  rate  of  discontinuation  due  to  an  AE  was  almost  doubled  compared  to  the  male 
population.  Considering  the  small  sample  size  and  low  number  of  participants  in  the  pembrolizumab 
treatment  arm  by  gender  (81  males  and  67  females),  this  does  not  represent  a  clinically  meaningful 
comparison. Nevertheless, the gender differences in incidences AEs should be further evaluated in future 
procedures. 
The incidence of drug-related AES, SAEs, serious drug-related AEs in the cHL population ≥ 65 years of age 
was  higher  than  in  subjects  <65  years  of  age  in  the  BV  arm  of  KEYNOTE-204  (e.g.,  Grade  3  to  5  AEs: 
68.2%  vs  39.2%)  and  the  RSD  (Grade  3  to  5  AEs:  53.0%  vs  44.5%).  Compared  with  participants  <65 
years  of  age  treated  with  pembrolizumab,  patients  ≥65  years  of  age  had  higher  (>15  percentage  point 
difference) rates of peripheral oedema (23.1% vs 0.8%), decreased appetite (23.1% vs 2.5%), and pain 
in extremity (23.1% vs 5.7%), which are expected AEs in an older population, who generally have more 
comorbidities compared to younger patients. However, the relatively small number of subjects who were ≥ 
65  years  old  in  the  cHL  Population  (n=26  in  the  KN-204  pembrolizumab  arm;  n=46  in  the  cHL  Safety 
Dataset) is not sufficient for a meaningful comparison with the cHL Population < 65 years of age, or the 
larger datasets at this time and any definitive conclusion can be drawn. In section 4.2 of the SmPC, it is 
already  reported  that  “Data  from  patients  ≥ 65 years  are  too  limited  to  draw  conclusions  on  cHL 
population”.  
Overall,  48  cHL  patient  treated  with  pembrolizumab  (from  KEYNOTE-204,  KEYNOTE-087  and  KEYNOTE-
051) received allogenic SCT. PD-1 inhibition prior to allo-SCT may enhance allogeneic T-cell responses and

augment  the  graft-versus-tumour  effect.  However,  prior  immunomodulation  may  also  increase  risk  of 
GVHD.  Complications  were  experienced  by  34  of  them  (with  acute  and/or  chronic  GVHD  as  the  most 
common  AEs  post  allo-SCT)  and  a  fatal  outcome  was  reported  in  6  patients  (two  patients,  both  in  the 
KEYNOTE-204  pembrolizumab  arm,  died  for  hypovolemic  shock  and  hypoxic  respiratory  failure;  four 
patients in KEYNOTE-087 for acute GVHD, hyperacute GVHD, pneumonia and sepsis), but none of these 
post allo-SCT AEs were considered by the MAH related to study treatment.  
Allo-SCT  after  PD-1  blockade  appears  feasible  with  a  low  rate  of  relapse.  However,  there  may  be  an 
increased risk of early immune toxicity, which could reflect long-lasting immune alterations triggered by 
prior PD-1 blockade, as acute and chronic GVHD post allo-transplant. Approximately 30-50% of patients 
with  cHL  experience  GVHD  after  allo-transplant  (Sure  A  et  al.  J  Clin  Oncol  2008).  Several  studies  have 
reported a higher rate of acute GVHD among patients who were exposed to check point inhibitor therapy 
before receiving allo-SCT and the median interval between exposures to the last dose of CPI and allo-HSCT 
was  variable,  ranging  between  28  and  62  days,  depending  on  the  half-life  of  the  checkpoint  inhibitor. 
Regardless of the mechanism of PD-1 depletion, it has been demonstrated that anti-PD-1 therapy creates 
a long-lasting disturbance in the composition of circulating T-cell populations. These findings would explain 
the absence of any apparent association between the time interval from PD-1 to transplantation and early 
toxicity and suggests that the use of a window period to delay HSCT for even several months after PD-1 
therapy  may  not  mitigate  the  impact  of  this  therapy  on  allo-SCT  outcomes  (Merryman  RW  et  al,  Blood 
2017). 
From the data provided by the MAH, it is highlighted that: i) overall, the median times from last dose of 
pembrolizumab to allo-SCT were similar, differing by ~1 month between those with GVHD and those who 
did not have GVHD. This suggests that the timing of the last dose of pembrolizumab in relation to the SCT 
could  not  influence  the  occurrence  of  post-transplant  acute  or  chronic  GVHD;  ii)  based  on  these  limited 
data from KEYNOTE-204, an association between the time from last dose of pembrolizumab and GVHD is 
not supported.  
While it was not possible to create a control cohort for this analysis that perfectly matched with all possible 
salient  characteristics  that  could  influence  the  occurrence  of  acute  and/or  chronic  GVHD  after 
pembrolizumab  (e.g.,  age,  disease,  sex,  donor,  graft  source,  GVHD  prophylaxis),  we  acknowledge  that 
many possible factors could be involved in the occurrence of GVHD and it is difficult to determine because 
participants  who  receive  an  allo-SCT  do  not  represent  a  homogeneous  population.  However,  these  data 
confirm  that  prior  PD-1  blockade  should  not  be  considered  a  contraindication  to  allo-SCT  in  this  patient 
population. 
Otherwise, treatment with pembrolizumab in the post-alloSCT disease relapse setting is feasible but can 
induce early and severe AEs.  Caution and careful monitoring are warranted, particularly in patients who 
have a history of GVHD, but additional long-term data are needed to fully evaluate the risks and benefits 
of using PD-1 inhibitor therapy after allo-SCT.  
There were no secondary malignancies in KEYNOTE-204.  
Information on pneumonits in cHL patients has been included in the SmPC (section 4.8)  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
In  the  KEYNOTE-051  study  most  participants  had  at  least  1  AE.  The  types  and  incidences  of  the  most 
frequently  reported  AEs  were  consistent  with  a  heavily  pretreated  paediatric  population  with  advanced 
cancers. No new safety signals were observed. 
Although  the  majority  of  participants  had  treatment-related  AEs,  pembrolizumab  was  well  tolerated  as 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 164/178 
 
 
  
  
 
evidenced  by  the  small  proportions  of  participants  with  Grade  3  to  5  treatment-related  AEs,  treatment-
related SAEs, and treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment. Approximately half 
of the participants had at least one Grade 3 to 5 AE. The most frequently reported treatment-related Grade 
3 to Grade 5 AEs were lymphocyte count decreased and anemia. 
Approximately one-third of the participants had at least 1 SAE up to 90 days after receiving the last dose 
of pembrolizumab. The most frequently reported treatment related SAEs were pyrexia, hypertension, and 
pleural  effusion,  each  occurring  in  ≤4  participants.  Five  participants  had  1  or  more  AEs  that  resulted  in 
death. For 1 participant with fatal pulmonary edema and 1 participant with fatal pneumonitis and pleural 
effusion, AEs were deemed as drug-related by the investigator. 
Thirty  (18.6%)  participants  had  at  least  1  AEOSI.  Four  participants  had  a  Grade  3  to  5  AEOSI:  colitis, 
myelitis, pruritus (each Grade 3) and pneumonitis (Grade 5). Two participants had an AEOSI that led to 
discontinuation of the study treatment: Grade 3 myelitis and Grade 5 pneumonitis. Among the participants 
with 1 or more AEOSI, 13 (43.3%) had resolution of an event by the time of data cut-off. Among the events 
that  had  not  resolved,  12  were  endocrinopathies  (ie,  hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism,  thyroiditis,  and 
adrenal insufficiency) that required long-term hormone replacement therapy. 
Most AEs did not lead to treatment interruption. The most frequently reported AE and treatment-related AE 
resulting  in  treatment  interruption  was  alanine  aminotransferase  increased  in  3  participants.  Three 
participants (2 with cHL, 1 with solid tumour NOS) received an allogeneic SCT after discontinuing treatment 
with  pembrolizumab.  Both  participants  with  cHL  received  alternative  systemic  anticancer  therapy  before 
the allogeneic SCT and developed GVHD post allogeneic SCT. Investigators deemed the GVHD not related 
to pembrolizumab. 
The safety results from KEYNOTE-051 were generally consistent with those reported for pembrolizumab in 
monotherapy  in  adult  patients,  as  demonstrated  in  a  head-to-head  comparison  of  frequencies  of  AEs  in 
KEYNOTE-051  vs  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  adult  safety  database  (RSD)  in  May  2019,  within 
variation EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0071. To support the submission of a Type II variation with the proposed 
indication extended to paediatric cHL patients, safety data from cHL children should be presented separately 
and comparison between the safety data of cHL paediatrics vs. the cumulative safety data from KEYNOTE-
051 and the safety profile in adults (particularly vs. the safety profile in cHL adults from the KEYNOTE-204 
and the cumulative cHL Safety Dataset) should be provided, also considering differences in the therapeutic 
history of these patients (e.g., prior lines of therapy, more frequent radiotherapy in paediatric patients). 
The  MAH  acknowledges  the  question  about  limited  paediatric  data  in  the  KEYNOTE-051  HL  cohort  that 
includes only 22 patients: the small sample size and the differences in prior therapies received compared 
with  adult  cHL  patients  limits  the  conclusions  that  can  be  drawn  when  comparing  this  cohort  to  other 
datasets. However, the data provided by the MAH comparing the cHL paediatric safety profile to cumulative 
paediatric safety data, showed that the patients with cHL had higher rates of drug-related AEs and dose 
modifications due to AEs compared with other tumour types, while participants with other tumor types had 
higher rates of Grade 3-5 AEs and SAEs. They experienced higher rates of overall AEOSI and drug-related 
AEOSI  compared  with  participants  with  other  tumor  types.  Nevertheless,  the  duration  of  exposure  to 
pembrolizumab was approximately 8-fold longer for participants in KEYNOTE-051 with cHL. Compared to 
the cHL safety profile in adults, consistent lower rates for all AE categories (except for AEOSI) could be 
observed. 
Treatment with pembrolizumab in paediatric participants could affect the immunological competence, not 
only in terms of decreased number of lymphocytes (one of the most frequently reported Grade 3 to 5 AEs 
in paediatric patients) but also of influencing the immunological functional activities, especially in paediatric 
patients with a less mature immune system. The MAH provided an update of immunological analyses for 
paediatric cHL patients included in KEYNOTE-051. Vaccinated antibody concentrations and memory B- and 
T-cell counts were collected as part of the secondary objectives of KEYNOTE-051 (data cut-off of January 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 165/178 
 
 
  
  
2020).  An  upward  trend  in  memory  B-  and  T-cell  counts  and  minimal  changes  in  the  concentration  of 
vaccinated antibodies from pre-treatment to post-treatment Cycle 4 were observed. Taken together, these 
data indicate that treatment with pembrolizumab does not appear to affect immunological competence in 
this paediatric patient population. 
The outcomes after transplant have been presented only for 2 cHL patients. This point is of importance in 
paediatric patients as the cure rate after allo-SCT is higher than in adults. After the cut-off date (10-JAN-
2020), no additional patients in KEYNOTE-051 received an allo transplant, so that an evaluation of potential 
cure rate in cHL paediatric patients (n=2) compared to adults is not possible.  
For KEYNOTE-204, the MAH provided additional information on all 14 allo-SCT participants, such as the last 
known contact date, the follow-up time since the allo-SCT and details on the mortality status. In particular, 
the MAH provided data on the allo-SCT participants post-pembrolizumab who experienced a GVHD event. 
These preliminary data confirm that GVHD is a frequent AE post pembrolizumab, especially as acute GVHD 
(reported  8  out  of  11  patients),  Grade  2  or  Grade  3  predominantly.  However,  also  chronic  GVHD 
mild/moderate/severe has been observed (in 3 out of 11 patients). Of the fourteen transplanted patients, 
two patients died, and the cause of death was respiratory failure and hypovolaemic shock, respectively. An 
interim  analysis  report  of  the  comprehensive  and  detailed  safety  analysis  of  adult  participants  with 
hematologic malignancies enrolled in MSD-sponsored studies who received an allo-SCT following therapy 
with pembrolizumab was submitted in December 2020. The was recommended to share the final analysis 
report across haematological malignancies, including paediatric and adult participants. 
As of the database cut-off date of 10-JAN-2020 in KEYNOTE-051, there was no additional data available of 
secondary malignancy, and only one participant with a primary diagnosis of solid tumour NOS developed a 
secondary malignancy of Grade 5 adenocarcinoma gastric, reported by the investigator as not treatment 
related.  There  were  no  secondary  malignancies  identified  in  KEYNOTE-204  and  KEYNOTE-087.  For 
KEYNOTE-051 the MAH will plan to enrol a minimum of 20 patients within the r/r cHL cohort, for which the 
next data cut-off for the analysis is planned in March 2024.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The incidence of most AEs did not differ significantly between study arms, with the exception of 
hypothyroidism and urinary tract infection in the pembrolizumab arm and higher incidences of nausea 
and peripheral neuropathy in the BV group. The overall AE profile observed in the KEYNOTE-204 
pembrolizumab group was generally consistent with the cHL Safety Dataset and the RSD. Despite the 
limited sample size, from KEYNOTE-051 study no unexpected safety signal was reported in cHL paediatric 
patients.  
The MAH will plan to enrol a minimum of 20 patients within the r/r cHL cohort in KEYNOTE-051, for which 
the next data cut-off for the analysis is planned in March 2024; this study is part of the PIP agreed with 
the PDCO. 
Finally, the MAH was recommended to share the final analysis report across haematological malignancies, 
including paediatric and adult participants. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  The Annex II was amended to reflect extended deadline 
for the submission of the PAES study KN-204. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The changes to the package leaflet are limited; in particular, the key messages for the safe use of the 
medicinal product are not impacted. Furthermore, the design, layout and format of the package leaflet 
will not be affected by the proposed revisions. Therefore, these proposed revisions do not constitute 
significant changes that would require the need to conduct a new user consultation or abridged focus 
testing.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved therapeutic indication is: KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
and paediatric patients aged 3 years and older with relapsed or refractory cHL who have failed autologous 
stem cell transplant (ASCT) or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT is not a treatment option. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The majority of patients with cHL can achieve long-term disease control/cure with frontline chemotherapy 
(e.g. ABVD, Stanford V or BEACOPP), yet 10 to 40% of patients still experience relapse or are refractory to 
the initial therapy. Salvage therapy is currently based on non cross-resistant chemotherapy regimens (e.g. 
DHAP, IGeV, GemOX plus dexamethasone, ICE etc.) that can re-induce remission in approximately 50-70% 
of patients. Long-term disease control following conventional therapy alone is, however, uncommon, and 
further  consolidation  with  high  dose  chemotherapy  and  ASCT  is  usually  administered  to  fit  patients. 
Consolidation with ASCT has been associated with long-term disease control/cure in approximately 50% of 
patients.  
BV is approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with r/r cHL following ASCT or at least two 
prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option. The ORR with BV in this 
setting has been shown to be as high as 60-75% (CRR 30-34%). 5-year OS was 41% (65% for patients 
who obtained a CR) and 5-year PFS was 22% (52% for patients in CR). However, exposure to BV is not 
devoid  of  toxicities:  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (overall  incidence  ~40%)  is  the  most  relevant  non-
hematologic adverse event (AE) (see Adcetris EPAR and SmPC). BV also proved to be an effective “bridge” 
to transplant (see e.g. Chen R et al, Blood 2016; Younes A et al, JCO 2012). 
Prognosis after failure of salvage chemotherapy, including BV, and/or ASCT is  poor. A selected subset of 
young and fit patients might be eligible to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT), which 
can  still  result  in  long-term  remission  in  a  subset  of  patients.  However,  transplant-related  mortality  and 
toxicity is not negligible. 
Overall, an unmet medical need for r/r cHL patients who failed or are unfit for ASCT can be recognised. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy of pembrolizumab in the claimed indication is mainly supported by the Interim Analysis 2 
results (data cutoff 16-JAN-2020, median survival follow-up of about 24.6 months) from Phase III study 
KN-204 (pivotal trial) comparing PFS (primary endpoint) as assessed by blinded independent central 
review (BICR), according to the IWG response criteria [Cheson, 2007], between pembrolizumab and BV 
treatment arms. 
Efficacy  data  from  paediatric  study  KN-051  were  also  submitted  to  support  the  proposed  extrapolation 
strategy using a model-based PK bridging analysis to include paediatric patients aged ≥3 years. Study KN-
051  was  a  Phase  I/II  study  investigating  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  paediatric  patients  with  solid 
tumours and malignant lymphomas.  
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 170/178 
 
 
  
  
Updated  efficacy  data  from  phase  II  study  KN-087  were  provided  to  further  characterise  the  efficacy  of 
pembrolizumab in r/r cHL. This is a single-arm, multi-cohort, non-randomized Phase 2 study investigating 
the efficacy of pembrolizumab monotherapy in a heterogeneous population of patients with cHL in advanced 
settings of relapse. Results for study KN-087 were pivotal in supporting the currently approved indication 
of pembrolizumab for the treatment of r/r cHL.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In adults (Pivotal study KN-204) pembrolizumab provided a statistically significant improvement in PFS 
(including clinical and imaging data post-SCT): median PFS in the ITT population of pivotal study KN-204 
was 13.2 months (95%CI 10.9, 19.4) and 8.3 months (95%CI 5.7, 8.8) with pembrolizumab and BV, 
respectively (HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.48, 0.88, p=0.00271). The estimated 24-month PFS rates were 35.4% 
and 25.4% with pembrolizumab and BV, respectively. Secondary PFS analysis (excluding clinical and 
imaging data post-SCT), PFS sensitivity analyses and analyses based on investigator assessment were 
consistent.  
The point estimation for ORR was numerically higher with pembrolizumab compared to BV: 65.6% 
(95%CI: 57.4, 73.1) vs. 54.2% (95%CI: 46.0, 62.3), respectively. The CRR was not different between 
treatment arms (24.5% for pembrolizumab and 24.2% for BV). The proportion of patients who received 
subsequent ASCT (~20%) or allogeneic HSCT (~9%) did not differ between pembrolizumab and BV. For 
pembrolizumab, median duration of response (DoR) was 20.7 months (range: 0.0+ to 33.2+ months) 
versus a median of 13.8 months (range: 0.0+ to 33.9+) with BV. The fraction of patients with response 
duration longer than 24 months was similar across treatment arms (47.4% vs. 42.8%). 
The results from the provided preliminary PFS2 analysis were in favour of pembrolizumab (HR 0.58, 95%CI 
0.38, 0.87, p=0.0037). 
Regarding  PRO,  with  respect  to  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30,  from  baseline  to  Week  24  a  trend  towards  an 
improvement  could  generally  be  observed  with  pembrolizumab  while,  conversely,  a  trend  towards 
deterioration was reported in the BV arm. The prespecified time to deterioration analysis also showed an 
improvement with pembrolizumab in the GHS/QOL (HR 0.40, 95%CI 0.22, 0.74) and physical functioning 
scores  (HR  0.56,  95%CI  0.32,  0.97).  Results  with  the  EQ-5D  instrument  were  consistent  with  those 
reported for the QLQ-C30 questionnaire: a significant difference in the LS means favouring pembrolizumab 
was observed at Week 24 for the utility (Δ 0.09 points, 95%CI 0.04, 0.14) and VAS scores (Δ 6.12 points, 
95%CI 1.91, 10.34). 
Clinical outcomes in subjects with ≥2 prior lines of therapy were consistent with the primary analysis in the 
ITT population: the ORRs  with pembrolizumab was 65.3% (95%CI 56.3, 73.6) vs. 54.4% (95%CI 45.3, 
63.3). The CRR was 26.6% (95%CI 19.1, 35.2) and 21.6% (95%CI 14.7, 29.8) with pembrolizumab and 
BV, respectively. PFS also consistently favoured the pembrolizumab arm (HR 0.66, 95%CI 0.47, 0.92): the 
mPFS was 12.6 months (95%CI 8.7, 19.4) with pembrolizumab and –8.2 months with BV (95%CI 5.6, 8.8) 
HR 0.62-0.70). No DoR and OS data by line of therapy were provided.  
Updated  results  from  the  supportive  study  KN-087with  a  median  duration  of  follow-up  of  39.5  months 
showed  an  IWG  ORR  by  BICR  of  71%  (95%CI  64.3,  77)  and  71.7%  (95%CI  58.6,  82.5)  in  the  overall 
population and in cohort 3 (BV-naïve patients), respectively. CRRs were 27.6% and 31.7%, median DoR 
16.6 and 16.8 months and median PFS 13.6 and 16.8 months, respectively. Median OS was still not reached 
in all cohorts. 
In paediatric patients (paediatric study KN-051) the ORR per IWG criteria observed in patients treated in 
the dedicated r/r cHL cohort (n=8) was 42.9% (3/7). Two out of 7 subjects achieved a CR. Median DoR in 
this cohort was not reached and median PFS (11.2 months) was overall in line with that observed in adults. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 171/178 
 
 
  
  
The ORR per RECIST criteria in the 15 patients treated in the PD-L1 positive tumours cohort was 66.7% 
(with one patient reaching a CR), the median DoR and PFS were 17.4 and 12.2 months, respectively. 
Among the 22 cHL participants, the ORR was 54.5% based on IWG 2007 criteria and 63.6% based on 
Lugano criteria. The CRR was 4.5% and 18.2% based on the IWG 2007 and Lugano criteria, respectively. 
Among the 12 responders by IWG 2007 criteria, the median time to response was 2.3 months and the 
median response duration was 17.3 months. Among the 14 responders by Lugano criteria, the median 
time to response was 2.1 months and the median response duration was 8.8 months. Among the 22 cHL 
participants, the median PFS was 8.3 months based on IWG 2007 criteria and 8.2 months based on 
Lugano criteria. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The OS data from KEYNOTE-204 are still immature and have not been statistically tested. Immaturity of 
PFS2  data  and  limited  information  on  subsequent  treatment  make  difficult  to  assess  the  impact  of 
uncontrolled cross-over. The provided DoR analysis was not sufficiently mature (only 40% of patient were 
informative). Updated results from the final CSR of KEYNOTE-204 - listed as a PAES (Annex IID) - will be 
submitted  for  review  in  accordance  with  agreed  timelines.  Data  in  HL  patients  ≥ 65 years  are  limited; 
however this is adequately reflected in sections 4.2. and 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Regarding the efficacy in  paediatric patients, the main uncertainty is the limited number (22) of r/r cHL 
paediatric patients treated in study KN-051. No clinical and no PK data are available below the age of 10 
with  cHL.  Descriptive  statistics  of  predicted  individual  exposure  parameters  for  paediatrics  and  adult 
patients shows that Cmin is about 50% higher in the 3-6 age group, although the median value is within 
the  Q3  for  adults.  Further,  there is  a  limited  follow-up  in  the  r/r  cHL  cohort  and  limited  clinical data  for 
paediatric patients who received subsequent SCT. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The median duration of exposure was twice as long for patients in the pembrolizumab arm compared with 
the BV arm. When adjusted for exposure, event rates for most AEs tended to be higher with BV.  
In  KEYNOTE-204,  the  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  were 
hypothyroidism  (15.5%),  pyrexia  (12.8%)  and  pruritus  (10.8%),  whereas  the  BV  group  showed  higher 
incidences  of  drug-related  neuropathy  peripheral  (18.4%),  nausea  (13.2%)  and  peripheral  sensory 
neuropathy  (13.2%).  The  incidence  and  types  of  drug-related  AEs  reported  in  the  KEYNOTE-204 
pembrolizumab  arm  were  generally  consistent  with  the  cHL  Safety  Dataset  and  with  the  RSD  (74.3%, 
73.3% and 70.2%). 
The overall incidence of Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AEs in KEYNOTE-204 was lower in the pembrolizumab 
arm (19.6%) than in the BV group (25%). The most frequently reported drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs 
were pneumonitis (4.1%), pneumonia (2%) and neutropenia (2%) in the pembrolizumab arm; neutropenia 
(7.2%),  neutrophil  count  decreased  (4.6%)  and  neuropathy  peripheral  (3.3%)  in  the  BV  arm.  A  higher 
difference  in  the  incidence  rates  of  the  other  safety  datasets  was  noted  for  pneumonitis  (4.1%  in  the 
KEYNOTE-204 pembrolizumab arm, 0.7% in the BV group, 1.8% in the cHL Safety Dataset, 1.3% in the 
RSD and 1.2% in the CSD). 
The incidence of Serious drug-related AEs was 16.2%, with pneumonitis as the most frequently occurring 
AE (5.4%). 
The most frequent AEOSIs were hypothyroidism (18.9%), pneumonitis (8.8%) in the pembrolizumab arm 
and infusion-related reaction (7.9%), hypothyroidism (2.6%), and pneumonitis (2%) in the BV arm. Most 
Assessment report  
EMA/97222/2021 
Page 172/178 
 
 
  
  
immune-mediated  AEOSIs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  were  managed  with  treatment 
interruptions and/or corticosteroids. At the time of data cut-off, 50.9% of patients were reported to have 
AEOSIs resolved, 9.4% were resolving and 37.7% were not resolved. 
Complications to allogenic HSCT (i.e, acute/chronic GVHD) were experienced in 34 out of 48 pembrolizumab 
treated patients who received transplantation after progression, and a fatal outcome was reported in 6 of 
them. 
The types and incidences of the most frequently reported AEs in paediatric patients in KEYNOTE-051 were 
consistent with a heavily pre-treated paediatric population with advanced cancers. Although the majority 
of participants (57.8%) had treatment-related AEs, pembrolizumab was well tolerated as evidenced by the 
small proportions of participants with Grade 3 to 5 treatment-related AEs (8.7%), treatment-related SAEs 
(9.9%),  and  treatment-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  the  study  treatment  (3.7%).  The  most 
frequently  reported  treatment-related  AEs  were  fatigue  (8.7%),  anaemia  (8.1%),  pyrexia  (7.5%), 
aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (6.8%),  lymphocyte  count  decreased  (6.8%),  diarrhoea  (6.2%), 
alanine aminotransferase increased (5.6%), and hypothyroidism (5.6%), the majority of them with Grade 
1-2 toxicity. The most frequently reported Grade 3 to 5 AEs were anaemia (8.1%) and lymphocyte count 
decreased  (5.6%).  The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  SAEs  were  pyrexia  (2.5%),  hypertension 
(1.2%), and pleural effusion (1.2%). The most frequently reported AEOSI were hypothyroidism (8.1%), 
hyperthyroidism (3.7%), hypersensitivity (2.5%), and pneumonitis (2.5%). 
As of the database cut-off date of 10-JAN-2020 in KEYNOTE-051, there was no additional data available 
of secondary malignancy, and only 1 participant with a primary diagnosis of solid tumour NOS developed 
a secondary malignancy of Grade 5 adenocarcinoma gastric. There were no secondary malignancies 
identified in KEYNOTE-204 and KEYNOTE-087. For KEYNOTE-051, the MAH will plan to enrol a minimum 
of 20 patients within the r/r cHL cohort, for which the next data cut-off for the analysis is planned in 
March 2024.  
Complications after allogenic HSCT (acute/chronic GVHD) were experienced in 2 cHL patients after 
discontinuing treatment with pembrolizumab. Both patients were alive but acute/chronic GVHD was not 
resolved. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Considering the recognized risk of exacerbating GVHD related to checkpoint inhibition, data on the 
feasibility of allogeneic HSCT after pembrolizumab are still limited, as indicated in the sections 4.4 and 
4.8 of the SmPC. After the cut-off date (10-JAN-2020), no additional patients in KEYNOTE-051 received 
an allo transplant, so that an evaluation of potential cure rate in cHL paediatric patients (n=2) compared 
to adults is not possible. An interim analysis report of the safety analysis of adult participants with 
hematologic malignancies enrolled in MSD-sponsored studies who received an allo-SCT following therapy 
with pembrolizumab was submitted in December 2020 and is currently under assessment.  
The MAH is also requested to share the final analysis report across haematological malignancies, including 
paediatric and adult participants by December 2024. - related to the following: FDA PMR 3188-2: 
Characterize complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following 
pembrolizumab in at least 90 patients with hematologic malignancies, of which at least 30% had received 
pembrolizumab alone or in combination as the regimen immediately prior to the allogeneic HSCT 
conditioning regimen. Evaluate toxicities at least through transplant Day 180. Include details of prior 
pembrolizumab treatment and the transplant regimen. Characterize toxicities including hyperacute graft-
versus-host disease (GVHD), severe (Grade 3-4) acute GVHD, febrile syndromes treated with steroids, 
immune mediated adverse events, pulmonary complications, hepatic veno-occlusive disease and/or

sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, critical illness, and transplant-related mortality. Toxicities may be 
characterized prospectively, or through a combination of prospective and retrospective data analysis.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
High  rates  of  long-term  disease  control/cure  are  usually  obtained  with  frontline  chemotherapy  in  cHL. 
Approximately half of the patients who experience relapse or have refractory disease can still achieve cure 
with high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT. The outcomes of patients who fail salvage therapy or ASCT 
are, however, unsatisfactory, and an unmet medical need can be recognised in this clinical setting. 
The approximate 5-month gain in median PFS observed with pembrolizumab in pivotal study KN-204, which 
is  equivalent  to  almost  35%  reduction  in  the  risk  for  progression  or  death,  can  be  considered  of  clinical 
relevance.  PFS  K-M  plots  did  not  show,  however,  any  clear  plateau,  confirming  that  long-term  disease 
control is rarely achieved in advanced stages of relapse.  
Resistance  to  treatment  is  an  important  issue  in  advanced  settings  of  r/r  cHL,  and  ORR  data  showed  a 
favourable trend with pembrolizumab, although CR rates and the % of patients who were able to received 
subsequent transplant were not improved compared to BV. Preliminary survival data from pivotal trial KN-
204 and PFS2 data, although immature, were supportive of the efficacy of pembrolizumab in this advanced 
setting. Further data will be provided with the submission of the final CSR as a PAES (already included in 
the Annex II). 
With respect to safety, the incidence of most AEs did not differ significantly across treatment arms, with 
the exception of hypothyroidism and urinary tract infection that were more common in the pembrolizumab 
arm, and nausea and peripheral neuropathy that were more frequent with BV. The safety profile observed 
in pivotal study KN-204 was generally consistent with the overall cHL Safety Dataset and the RSD. No new 
safety concerns were identified. 
The available efficacy data from paediatric study KN-051 are limited, as expected due to the rarity of cHL 
in children. On the other hand, the high unmet medical need in paediatric patients for whom 
chemotherapy is no longer an option is recognised and, despite the limited available data, the proposed 
extrapolation of treatment effect from adults to paediatric patients with cHL in advanced settings of 
relapse can be considered acceptable on the basis of similar prognostic and clinical characteristics of the 
disease, pharmacological drug effect and exposure-response relationship across all age classes. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The available efficacy data from study KN-204 support the superiority of pembrolizumab vs. BV in subjects 
who have failed salvage chemotherapy +/- ASCT, with an acceptable safety profile.  
Clinical data in paediatric patients are limited, yet the anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab is confirmed 
and the overall safety profile did not differ significantly compared to what observed in adults. An 
extrapolation of treatment effect from adults to paediatric patients with cHL in advanced settings of 
relapse is considered acceptable. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The limited available data in 2nd line transplant-ineligible patients were not adequate to establish a positive 
B/R  in  this  subgroup.  Overall,  the  available  data  convincingly  demonstrated  the  superiority  of 
pembrolizumab vs. BV in subjects who have failed salvage chemotherapy and/or ASCT (i.e. subjects with 
≥2 prior therapies).

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda as monotherapy for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 3 years 
and  older  with  relapsed  or  refractory  classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma  who  have  failed  autologous  stem  cell 
transplant (ASCT) or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT is not a treatment option is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of the currently approved therapeutic indication for the treatment of relapsed or refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma (rrcHL) in adults to an earlier line of therapy and to include paediatric 
patients - as follows: 
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 3 years 
and older with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have failed autologous stem cell 
transplant (ASCT) or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT is not a treatment option.  
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. The Annex II was revised to reflect extended deadline for the submission of the 
PAES KN-204. Revised RMP Version 30 of the RMP has also been submitted.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0008/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Keytruda is not similar to Adcetris within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

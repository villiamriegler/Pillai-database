CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due 
to very low, low and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring 
sideroblasts, who had an unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for erythropoietin-based 
therapy (see section 5.1). 
Reblozyl is indicated in adults for the treatment of anaemia associated with 
transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Reblozyl treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in treatment of 
haematological diseases.

UPosology 
Prior to each Reblozyl administration, the haemoglobin (Hb) level of patients should be 
assessed. In case of a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion occurring prior to dosing, the 
pre-transfusion Hb level must be considered for dosing purposes. 
The recommended starting dose of Reblozyl is 1.0 mg/kg administered once every 3 weeks. 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes 
In patients who are not RBC transfusion-free after at least 2 consecutive doses at the 1.0 mg/kg 
starting dose, the dose should be increased to 1.33 mg/kg. If patients are not RBC transfusion-
free after at least 2 consecutive doses at the 1.33 mg/kg dose level, the dose should be increased 
to 1.75 mg/kg. The dose increase should not occur more frequently than every 6 weeks 
(2 administrations) and should not exceed the maximum dose of 1.75 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The 
dose should not be increased immediately after a dose delay. 
For patients with a pre-dose Hb level of > 9 g/dL and who have not yet achieved transfusion 
independence, a dose increase may be required at the physician’s discretion; the risk of Hb 
increasing above the target threshold with concomitant transfusion cannot be excluded. 
If a patient loses response (i.e., transfusion independence), the dose should be increased by one 
dose level (see Table 1). 
•  Transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia  
In patients who do not achieve a response, defined as a reduction in RBC transfusion burden of 
at least a third after ≥ 2 consecutive doses (6 weeks), at the 1.0 mg/kg starting dose, the dose 
should be increased to 1.25 mg/kg. The dose should not be increased beyond the maximum dose 
of 1.25 mg/kg every 3 weeks. 
If a patient loses response (if the RBC transfusion burden increases again after an initial 
response) the dose should be increased by one dose level (see Table 2). 
•  Non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia  
In patients who do not achieve or maintain a response, defined as an increase from baseline in 
pre-dose Hb of ≥1 g/dL, after ≥ 2 consecutive doses (6 weeks) at the same dose level (in 
absence of transfusions, i.e., at least 3 weeks after the last transfusion), the dose should be 
increased by one dose level (see Table 2). The dose should not exceed the maximum dose of 
1.25 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

UDose reduction and dose delay  
In case of Hb increase > 2 g/dL within 3 weeks in absence of transfusion compared with the Hb 
value at previous dose, Reblozyl dose should be reduced by one dose level. 
If the Hb is ≥ 11.5 g/dL in the absence of transfusion for at least 3 weeks, the dose should be 
delayed until the Hb is ≤ 11.0 g/dL. If there is also a concomitant rapid increase in Hb from the 
Hb value at previous dose (> 2 g/dL within 3 weeks in absence of transfusion), a dose reduction 
to one step down should be considered after the dose delay. 
Dose should not be reduced below 0.8 mg/kg (for MDS or transfusion-dependent 
β-thalassaemia) and below 0.6 mg/kg (for non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia). 
Reduced dose during treatment with luspatercept are provided below.

UMissed doses 
In case of a missed or delayed scheduled treatment administration, the patient should be 
administered Reblozyl as soon as possible and dosing continued as prescribed with at least 
3 weeks between doses. 
UPatients experiencing a loss of response 
If patients experience a loss of response to Reblozyl, causative factors (e.g. a bleeding event) 
should be assessed. If typical causes for a loss of haematological response are excluded, dose 
increase should be considered as described above for the respective indication being treated (see 
Table17T 17T1 and Table 2). 
UDiscontinuation 
Reblozyl should be discontinued if patients do not experience a reduction in transfusion burden 
(for transfusion-dependent MDS or β-thalassaemia patients) or an increase from baseline Hb in 
the absence of transfusions (for non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients) after 
9 weeks of treatment (3 doses) at the maximum dose level, if no alternative explanations for 
response failure are found (e.g. bleeding, surgery, other concomitant illnesses) or if 
unacceptable toxicity occurs at any time. 
USpecial populations 
Elderly 
No starting dose adjustment is required for Reblozyl (see section 5.2). Limited data are available 
in β-thalassaemia patients ≥ 60 years of age. 
Hepatic impairment 
No starting dose adjustment is required for patients with total bilirubin (BIL) > upper limit of 
normal (ULN) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
< 3 x ULN (see section 5.2).  
No specific dose recommendation can be made for patients with ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN or 
liver injury CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 due to lack of data (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No starting dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment 
2
(estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 90 and ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 mP
are available for patients with moderate renal impairment. 
No specific dose recommendation can be made for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 
2
< 30 mL/min/1.73 mP
impairment at baseline have been observed to have higher exposure (see section 5.2). 
Consequently, these patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions and dose 
adjustment should be managed accordingly (see Table 5). 
P) due to lack of clinical data (see section 5.2). Patients with renal 
P). Only limited data 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Reblozyl in the paediatric population for the indication of 
myelodysplastic syndromes, or in paediatric patients less than 6 years of age in β-thalassaemia. 
The safety and efficacy of Reblozyl in the paediatric patients aged from 6 years to less than 
18 years have not yet been established in β-thalassaemia. For non-clinical data, see section 5.3. 
UMethod of administration 
For subcutaneous use. 
After reconstitution, Reblozyl solution should be injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, 
thigh or abdomen. The exact total dosing volume of the reconstituted solution required for the 
patient should be calculated and slowly withdrawn from the single-dose vial(s) into a syringe. 
The recommended maximum volume of medicinal product per injection site is 1.2 mL. If more 
than 1.2 mL is required, the total volume should be divided into separate similar volume 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
injections and administered across separate sites using the same anatomical location but on 
opposite sides of the body. 
If multiple injections are required, a new syringe and needle must be used for each subcutaneous 
injection. 11TNo more than one dose from a vial should be 11Tadministered. 
If the Reblozyl solution has been refrigerated after reconstitution, it should be removed from the 
refrigerator 15-30 minutes prior to injection to allow it to reach room temperature. This will 
allow for a more comfortable injection. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6.

UTraceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
UThromboembolic events 
In β-thalassaemia patients, thromboembolic events (TEEs) were reported in 3.6% (8/223) of 
patients treated with luspatercept in the double-blind phase of the pivotal study in 
transfusion-dependent patients and in 0.7% (1/134) of patients during the open-label phase of 
the pivotal study in non-transfusion-dependent patients. Reported TEEs included deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT), portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, ischaemic stroke and superficial 
thrombophlebitis (see section 4.8). All patients with TEEs were splenectomised and had at least 
one other risk factor for developing TEE (e.g. history of thrombocytosis or concomitant use of 
hormone replacement therapy). The occurrence of TEE was not correlated with elevated Hb 
levels. The potential benefit of treatment with luspatercept should be weighed against the 
potential risk of TEEs in β-thalassaemia patients with a splenectomy and other risk factors for 
developing TEE. Thromboprophylaxis according to current clinical guidelines should be 
considered in patients with β-thalassaemia at higher risk. 
UExtramedullary haemopoiesis masses 
In transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients, extramedullary haemopoiesis (EMH) masses 
were observed in 3.2% (10/315) of patients treated with luspatercept in the pivotal study and in 
the long-term follow-up study. Spinal cord compression symptoms due to EMH masses 
occurred in 1.9% (6/315) of patients treated with luspatercept (see section 4.8). 
In non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients, EMH masses were observed in 6.3% 
(6/96) of patients treated with luspatercept in the pivotal study. Spinal cord compression due to 
EMH masses occurred in 1.0% (1/96) of patients treated with luspatercept. During the 
open-label portion of the study, EMH masses were observed in 2 additional patients for a total 
of 8/134 (6.0%) of patients (see section 4.8).  
Patients with EMH masses may experience worsening of these masses and complications during 
treatment. Signs and symptoms may vary depending on anatomical location. Patients should be 
monitored at initiation and during treatment for symptoms and signs or complications resulting 
from the EMH masses, and be treated according to clinical guidelines. Treatment with 
luspatercept must be discontinued in case of serious complications due to EMH masses.

UIncreased blood pressure 
In MDS and β-thalassaemia pivotal studies, patients treated with luspatercept had an average 
increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg from baseline (see section 4.8). An 
increased incidence of hypertension was observed in the first 12 months of treatment in 
non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept (see section 4.8).  
The treatment must be started only if the blood pressure is adequately controlled. Blood 
pressure should be monitored prior to each luspatercept administration. Luspatercept dose may 
require adjustment or may be delayed and patients should be treated for hypertension as per 
current clinical guidelines (see Table 5 in section 4.2). The potential benefit of treatment with 
Reblozyl should be re-evaluated in case of persistent hypertension or exacerbations of 
preexisting hypertension. 
UTraumatic fracture 
In non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients, traumatic fractures were observed in 
8.3% (8/96) of patients treated with luspatercept. Patients should be informed of the risk of 
traumatic fracture.  
USodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal clinical interaction studies have been performed. Concurrent use of iron-chelating 
agents had no effect on luspatercept pharmacokinetics. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
UWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with 
Reblozyl and for at least 3 months after the last dose. Prior to starting treatment with Reblozyl, a 
pregnancy test has to be performed for women of childbearing potential and the patient card has 
to be provided. 
UPregnancy 
Treatment with Reblozyl should not be started if the woman is pregnant (see section 4.3). 
There are no data from the use of Reblozyl in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Reblozyl is contraindicated during pregnancy (see 
section 4.3). If a patient becomes pregnant, Reblozyl should be discontinued. 
UBreast-feeding 
It is unknown whether luspatercept or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Luspatercept 
was detected in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). Because of the unknown adverse 
effects of luspatercept in newborns/infants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding during therapy with Reblozyl and for 3 months after the last dose or to 
discontinue Reblozyl therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and 
the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
UFertility 
The effect of luspatercept on fertility in humans is unknown. Based on findings in animals, 
luspatercept may compromise female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Reblozyl may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The ability to 
react when performing these tasks may be impaired due to risks of fatigue, vertigo, dizziness or 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
syncope (see section 4.8). Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they 
know of any impact on their ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
USummary of the safety profile 
Myelodysplastic syndromes

UDescription of selected adverse reactions 
Bone pain 
Bone pain was reported in 36.5% of non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated 
with luspatercept (placebo 6.1%), in 19.7% of transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients 
treated with luspatercept (placebo 8.3%) and in 2.6% of MDS patients treated with luspatercept 
(placebo 3.9%). In non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept, 
most events (32/35) were Grade 1-2, with 3 events Grade 3. No patient discontinued due to bone 
pain. In transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept, bone pain was 
most common in the first 3 months (16.6%) compared to months 4-6 (3.7%). Most events 
(41/44 events) were Grade 1-2, with 3 events Grade 3. One of the 44 events was serious, and 
1 event led to treatment discontinuation.  
Arthralgia 
Arthralgia was reported in 29.2% of non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated 
with luspatercept (placebo 14.3%), in 19.3% of transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients 
treated with luspatercept (placebo 11.9%) and in 5.2% of MDS patients treated with 
luspatercept (placebo 11.8%). In non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated with 
luspatercept, most events (26/28) were Grade 1-2, with 2 events Grade 3. In the 
transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated with 
luspatercept, arthralgia led to treatment discontinuation in 2 patients (0.9%) and 1 patient 
(1.0%), respectively.

Hypertension 
Patients treated with luspatercept had an average increase in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure of 5 mmHg from baseline not observed in patients receiving placebo. Hypertension 
was reported in 8.5% of MDS patients treated with luspatercept (placebo 9.2%), in 19.8% of 
non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept (placebo 2.0%), 
and in 8.1% of transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept (placebo 
2.8%). See section 4.4. 
An increased incidence of hypertension was observed over time in the first 8-12 months in 
non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept. See section 4.4. 
Grade 3 hypertension events were reported in MDS patients, for 5 patients (3.3%) treated with 
luspatercept and in 3 patients (3.9%) receiving placebo. In non-transfusion-dependent 
β-thalassaemia patients, most events (16/19) were Grade 1-2 with 3 events Grade 3 (3.1%) in 
patients treated with luspatercept (0.0% placebo). In transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia 
patients, Grade 3 events were reported in 4 patients (1.8%) treated with luspatercept (0.0% 
placebo). See section 4.4. 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity-type reactions (including eyelid oedema, drug hypersensitivity, swelling face, 
periorbital oedema, face oedema, angioedema, lip swelling, drug eruption) were reported in 
4.6% of MDS patients (placebo 2.6%) and in 4.5% of transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia 
patients treated with luspatercept (placebo 1.8%). In clinical studies, all events were Grade 1-2. 
In transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept, hypersensitivity led 
to treatment discontinuation in 1 patient (0.4%). Face oedema occurred in 3.1% (placebo 0.0%) 
of non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions (including injection site erythema, injection site pruritus, injection site 
swelling and injection site rash) were reported in 5.2% of non-transfusion-dependent 
β-thalassaemia patients (placebo 0.0%), in 3.9% of MDS patients (placebo 0.0%) and in 2.2% of 
transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients (placebo 1.8%). In clinical studies, all events 
were Grade 1 and none led to discontinuation. 
Thromboembolic events 
Thromboembolic events (including deep vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, ischaemic 
stroke and pulmonary embolism) occurred in 3.6% of transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia 
patients receiving luspatercept (placebo 0.9%). In the open-label phase of the pivotal study in 
non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia, thromboembolic event (superficial 
thrombophlebitis) occurred in 0.7% of patients. All events were reported in patients who had 
undergone splenectomy and had at least one other risk factor. No difference in TEEs was 
observed between luspatercept and placebo arms in MDS patients. See section 4.4. 
Extramedullary haemopoiesis masses 
EMH masses occurred in 10/315 (3.2%) transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients 
receiving luspatercept (placebo 0.0%). Five events were Grade 1-2, 4 events were Grade 3, and 
1 event was Grade 4. Three patients discontinued due to EMH masses. See section 4.4. 
EMH masses occurred in 6/96 (6.3%) non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients 
receiving luspatercept (placebo 2%). Most (5/6) were Grade 2 and 1 was Grade 1. One patient 
discontinued due to EMH masses. During the open-label portion of the study, EMH masses 
were observed in 2 additional patients for a total of 8/134 (6.0%) of patients. Most (7/8) were 
Grade 1-2 and manageable with standard clinical practice. In 6/8 patients, luspatercept was 
continued after onset of event. See section 4.4. 
EMH masses may also occur after extended treatment with luspatercept (i.e. after 96 weeks).

Spinal cord compression 
Spinal cord compression or symptoms due to EMH masses occurred in 6/315 (1.9%) 
transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients receiving luspatercept (placebo 0.0%). Four 
patients discontinued treatment due to Grade ≥ 3 symptoms of spinal cord compression. 
Spinal cord compression due to EMH masses occurred in 1/96 (1.0%) 
non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patient with a history of EMH masses receiving 
luspatercept (placebo 0.0%). This patient discontinued treatment due to Grade 4 spinal cord 
compression. See section 4.4. 
Traumatic fracture 
Traumatic fracture occurred in 8 (8.3%) non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients 
receiving luspatercept (placebo 2.0%), and in 1 (0.4%) transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia 
patient receiving luspatercept (placebo 0.0%). In non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia 
patients, Grade ≥ 3 events were reported for 4 patients (4.2%) treated with luspatercept and in 
1 patient (2.0%) receiving placebo.  
Immunogenicity 
In clinical studies in MDS, an analysis of 260 MDS patients who were treated with luspatercept 
and who were evaluable for the presence of anti-luspatercept antibodies showed that 23 (8.8%) 
MDS patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-luspatercept antibodies, including 9 
(3.5%) MDS patients who had neutralising antibodies against luspatercept. 
In clinical studies in transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia, an 
analysis of 380 β-thalassaemia patients who were treated with luspatercept and who were 
evaluable for the presence of anti-luspatercept antibodies showed that 7 (1.84%) β-thalassaemia 
patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-luspatercept antibodies, including 5 (1.3%) 
β-thalassaemia patients who had neutralising antibodies against luspatercept. 
Luspatercept serum concentration tended to decrease in the presence of neutralising antibodies. 
There were no severe systemic hypersensitivity reactions reported for patients with 
anti-luspatercept antibodies. There was no association between hypersensitivity type reactions 
or injection site reactions and presence of anti-luspatercept antibodies. 
UReporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in 44TUAppendix VU44T. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose with luspatercept may cause an increase of Hb values above the desired level. In the 
event of an overdose, treatment with luspatercept should be delayed until Hb is ≤ 11 g/dL.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antianaemic preparations, other antianaemic preparations, ATC 
code: B03XA06. 
Mechanism of action 
Luspatercept, an erythroid maturation agent, is a recombinant fusion protein that binds selected 
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily ligands. By binding to specific endogenous 
ligands (e.g. GDF-11, activin B) luspatercept inhibits Smad2/3 signalling, resulting in erythroid 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
maturation through differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors (normoblasts) in the bone 
marrow. Smad2/3 signalling is abnormally high in disease models characterised by ineffective 
erythropoiesis, i.e. MDS and β-thalassaemia, and in the bone marrow of MDS patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Myelodysplastic syndromes 
The efficacy and safety of luspatercept were evaluated in a Phase 3 multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study MEDALIST (ACE-536-MDS-001) in adult patients with 
anaemia requiring RBC transfusions (≥ 2 units/8 weeks) due to International Prognostic Scoring 
System-Revised (IPSS-R) very low-, low- or intermediate-risk MDS who have ring sideroblasts 
(≥ 15%). Patients were required to have either received prior treatment with an erythropoiesis-
stimulating agent (ESA) with inadequate response, to be ineligible for ESAs (determined to be 
unlikely to respond to ESA treatment with serum erythropoietin (EPO) > 200 U/L), or intolerant 
to ESA treatment. Patients with deletion 5q (del5q) MDS were excluded from the study. 
Patients in both arms were treated for 24 weeks, then continued treatment if they had 
demonstrated clinical benefit and absence of disease progression. The study was unblinded for 
analyses when all patients had at least received 48 weeks of treatment or discontinued treatment. 
A total of 229 patients were randomised to receive luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg (n=153) or placebo 
(n=76) subcutaneously every 3 weeks. A total of 128 (83.7%) and 68 (89.5%) patients receiving 
luspatercept and placebo respectively completed 24 weeks of treatment. A total of 78 (51%) and 
12 (15.8%) patients receiving luspatercept and placebo respectively completed 48 weeks of 
treatment. Dose titration up to 1.75 mg/kg was allowed. Dose could be delayed or reduced 
depending upon Hb level. All patients were eligible to receive best supportive care (BSC), 
which included RBC transfusions, iron-chelating agents, use of antibiotic, antiviral and 
antifungal therapy, and nutritional support, as needed. The key baseline disease characteristics 
in patients with MDS in study ACE-536-MDS-001 are shown in Table 7.

The median duration of the longest RBC Transfusion Independent (RBC-TI) period among 
responders in the luspatercept treatment arm was 30.6 weeks.

Week 1-24 had 2 or more episodes of RBC-TI at the time of analysis. 
Transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia 
The efficacy and safety of luspatercept were evaluated in a Phase 3 multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study BELIEVE (ACE-536-B-THAL-001) in adult patients 
with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia–associated anaemia who require RBC transfusions 
(6-20 RBC units/24 weeks) with no transfusion-free period > 35 days during that period. 
Patients in both the luspatercept and placebo arms were treated for at least 48 and up to 
96 weeks. After unblinding, placebo patients were able to cross-over to luspatercept. 
A total of 336 adult patients were randomised to receive luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg (n=224) or 
placebo (n=112) subcutaneously every 3 weeks. Dose titration to 1.25 mg/kg was allowed. Dose 
could be delayed or reduced depending upon Hb level. All patients were eligible to receive 
BSC, which included RBC transfusions, iron-chelating agents, use of antibiotic, antiviral and 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antifungal therapy, and nutritional support, as needed. The study excluded patients with Hb 
S/β-thalassaemia or alpha (α)-thalassaemia or who had major organ damage (liver disease, heart 
disease, lung disease, renal insufficiency). Patients with recent DVT or stroke or recent use of 
ESA, immunosuppressant or hydroxyurea therapy were also excluded. The key baseline disease 
characteristics in patients with β-thalassaemia in study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 are shown in

A total of 85% (147/173) of luspatercept responders who achieved at least a 33% reduction in

response at the time of analysis. 
Non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia 
The efficacy and safety of luspatercept were evaluated in a Phase 2 multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study BEYOND (ACE-536-B-THAL-002) in adult patients 
with non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia-associated anaemia 
(Hb concentration ≤ 10 g/dL). 
A total of 145 adult patients receiving RBC transfusions (0-5 RBC units in the 24-week period 
prior to randomization), with a baseline Hb level ≤ 10.0 g/dL (defined as average of at least 2 
Hb measurments ≥ 1 week apart within 4 weeks prior to randomization) were randomized to 
receive luspatercept (n=96) or placebo (n=49) subcutaneously every 3 weeks. Patients were 
stratified at randomization based on their baseline Hb level and their non-transfusion-dependent 
β-thalassaemia (NTDT) patient-reported outcome (PRO; NTDT-PRO) Tiredness/Weakness 
(T/W) weekly domain score. Dose titration to 1.25 mg/kg was allowed. Dose could be delayed 
or reduced depending upon Hb level. Overall, 53% of luspatercept patients (n=51) and 92% of 
patients on placebo (n=45) had their dose increased to 1.25 mg/kg within the 48-week treatment 
period. Among patients receiving luspatercept, 96% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 
86% were exposed for 12 months or longer. A total of 89 (92.7%) patients receiving 
luspatercept and 35 (71.4%) patients receiving placebo completed 48 weeks of treatment. 
All patients were eligible to receive BSC, which included RBC transfusions, iron-chelating 
agents, use of antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal therapy, and nutritional support, as needed. 
Concurrent treatment for anemia with blood transfusions was allowed, at the discretion of the 
physician, for low haemoglobin levels, symptoms associated with anemia (eg, haemodynamic or 
pulmonary compromise requiring treatment) or comorbidities. The study excluded patients with 
Hb S/β-thalassaemia or alpha (α)-thalassaemia or who had major organ damage (liver disease, 
heart disease, lung disease, renal insufficiency), active hepatitis C or B, or HIV. Patients with 
recent DVT or stroke or recent use of ESA, immunosuppressant or hydroxyurea therapy, or on 
chronic anticoagulant or uncontrolled hypertension were also excluded. Only a limited number 
of patients with comorbidities associated with underlying anemia such as pulmonary 
hypertension, liver and kidney disease and diabetes were included in the study.

A total of 77.1% of luspatercept treated patients achieved an increase from baseline ≥ 1.0 g/dL 
in mean Hb over continuous 12-week interval (in absence of transfusions) (Week 13-24). This 
effect was maintained in the 57.3% of patients who reached Week 144 of treatment.  
Paediatric population 
Myelodysplastic syndromes 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Reblozyl in all subsets of the paediatric population in myelodysplastic syndromes (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
β-thalassaemia 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies 
with Reblozyl in one or more subsets of paediatric population older than 6 years of age in β-
thalassaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In healthy volunteers and patients, luspatercept is slowly absorbed following subcutaneous 
administration, with the CRmaxR in serum often observed approximately 7 days post-dose across all 
dose levels. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis suggests that the absorption of 
luspatercept into the circulation is linear over the range of studied doses, and the absorption is 
not significantly affected by the subcutaneous injection location (upper arm, thigh or abdomen). 
Interindividual variability in AUC was approximately 38% in MDS patients and 36% in 
β-thalassaemia patients. 
Distribution 
At the recommended doses, the mean apparent volume of distribution was 9.68 L for MDS 
patients and 7.26 L for β-thalassaemia patients. The small volume of distribution indicates that 
luspatercept is confined primarily in extracellular fluids, consistent with its large molecular 
mass. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Luspatercept is expected to be catabolised into amino acids by general protein degradation 
process. 
Elimination 
Luspatercept is not expected to be excreted into urine due to its large molecular mass that is 
above the glomerular filtration size exclusion threshold. At the recommended doses, the mean 
apparent total clearance was 0.516 L/day for MDS patients and 0.441 L/day for β-thalassaemia. 
The mean half-life in serum was approximately 13 days for MDS patients and 11 days for 
β-thalassaemia patients. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The increase of luspatercept CRmaxR and AUC in serum is approximately proportional to increases 
in dose from 0.125 to 1.75 mg/kg. Luspatercept clearance was independent of dose or time. 
When administered every three weeks, luspatercept serum concentration reaches the steady state 
after 3 doses, with an accumulation ratio of approximately 1.5. 
Hb response 
In patients who received < 4 units of RBC transfusion within 8 weeks prior to the study, Hb 
increased within 7 days of treatment initiation and the increase correlated with the time to reach 
luspatercept CRmaxR. The greatest mean Hb increase was observed after the first dose, with 
additional smaller increases observed after subsequent doses. Hb levels returned to baseline 
value approximately 6 to 8 weeks from the last dose (0.6 to 1.75 mg/kg). Increasing luspatercept 
serum exposure (AUC) was associated with a greater Hb increase in patients with MDS or 
β-thalassaemia. 
In non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients who had a baseline transfusion burden of 
0 to 5 units within 24 weeks, increasing luspatercept serum exposure (time-averaged AUC) was 
associated with a greater probability of achieving a Hb increase (≥ 1 g/dL or ≥ 1.5 g/dL) and a 
longer duration of such Hb increases. The luspatercept serum concentration achieving 50% of 
the maximum stimulatory effect on Hb production was estimated to be 7.6 μg/mL. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Population PK analysis for luspatercept included patients with ages ranging from 18 to 95 years 
old, with a median age of 72 years for MDS patients and of 33 years for β-thalassaemia patients. 
No clinically significant difference in AUC or clearance was found across age groups in MDS 
patients (< 65, 65-74, and ≥ 75 years) or in β-thalassaemia patients (18 to 71 years). 
Hepatic impairment 
Population PK analysis for luspatercept included patients with normal hepatic function (BIL, 
ALT, and AST ≤ ULN; N = 207), mild hepatic impairment (BIL > 1 – 1.5 x ULN, and ALT or 
AST > ULN; N = 160), moderate hepatic impairment (BIL > 1.5 – 3 x ULN, any ALT or AST; 
N = 138), or severe hepatic impairment (BIL > 3 x ULN, any ALT or AST; N = 40) as defined 
by the National Cancer Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction. Effects of hepatic function 
categories, elevated liver enzymes (ALT or AST, up to 3 x ULN) and elevated total BIL (4 – 
246 µmol/L) on luspatercept clearance were not observed. No clinically significant difference in 
mean steady state CRmaxR and AUC was found across hepatic function groups. PK data are 
insufficient for patients with liver enzymes (ALT or AST) ≥ 3 x ULN. No PK data are available 
for patients with liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B and C) as no dedicated study was 
performed. 
Renal impairment 
Population PK analysis for luspatercept included patients with normal renal function (eGFR

Other intrinsic factors 
The following population characteristics have no clinically significant effect on luspatercept 
AUC or clearance: sex and race (Asian vs. White). 
The following baseline disease characteristics had no clinically significant effect on luspatercept 
clearance: serum erythropoietin level, RBC transfusion burden, MDS ring sideroblasts, 
β-thalassaemia genotype (β0/β0 vs. non-β0/β0) and splenectomy. 
The volume of distribution and clearance of luspatercept increased with increase of body 
weight, supporting the body weight-based dosing regimen. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Single and repeat-dose toxicity 
Following repeated administration of luspatercept in rats, toxicities included: 
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; congestion, necrosis and/or mineralisation of the 
adrenal glands; hepatocellular vacuolation and necrosis; mineralisation of the glandular 
stomach; and decreased heart and lung weights with no associated histology findings. A clinical 
observation of swollen hindlimbs/feet was noted in several studies in rats and rabbits (including 
juvenile and reproductive toxicity studies). In one juvenile rat, this correlated 
histopathologically with new bone formation, fibrosis, and inflammation. 
Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis was also seen in monkeys. Additional toxicities in 
monkeys included: vascular degeneration and inflammatory infiltrates in the choroid plexus. 
For the 6-month toxicity study, the longest duration study in monkeys, the no-observed-adverse-
effect level (NOAEL) was 0.3 mg/kg (0.3-fold of clinical exposure at 1.75 mg/kg every 
3 weeks). A NOAEL was not identified in rats and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level 
(LOAEL) in the rat 3-month study was 1 mg/kg (0.9-fold of clinical exposure at 1.75 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks). 
Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis 
Neither carcinogenicity nor mutagenicity studies with luspatercept have been conducted. 
Haematological malignancies were observed in 3 out of 44 rats examined in the highest dose 
group (10 mg/kg) in the definitive juvenile toxicity study. The occurrence of these tumours in 
young animals is unusual and the relationship to luspatercept therapy cannot be ruled out. At the 
10 mg/kg dose, at which tumours were observed, the exposure represents an exposure multiple 
of approximately 4 times the estimated exposure at a clinical dose of 1.75 mg/kg every three 
weeks. 
No other proliferative or pre-neoplastic lesions, attributable to luspatercept, have been observed 
in any species in other non-clinical safety studies conducted with luspatercept, including the 6-
month study in monkeys. 
Fertility 
In a fertility study in rats, administration of luspatercept to females at doses higher than the 
currently recommended highest human dose reduced the average number of corpora lutea, 
implantations and viable embryos. No such effects were observed when exposure in animals 
was at 1.5 times the clinical exposure. Effects on fertility in female rats were reversible after a 
14-week recovery period. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of luspatercept to male rats at doses higher than the currently recommended 
highest human dose had no adverse effect on male reproductive organs or on their ability to 
mate and produce viable embryos. The highest dose tested in male rats yielded an exposure 
approximately 7 times the clinical exposure. 
Embryo-foetal development (EFD) 
Embryo-foetal developmental toxicology studies (range-finding and definitive studies) were 
conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits. In the definitive studies, doses of up to 30 mg/kg or 
40 mg/kg every week were administered twice during the period of organogenesis. Luspatercept 
was a selective developmental toxicant (dam not affected; foetus affected) in the rat and a 
maternal and foetal developmental toxicant (doe and foetus affected) in the rabbit. Embryofoetal 
effects were seen in both species and included reductions in numbers of live foetuses and foetal 
body weights, increases in resorptions, post-implantation loss and skeletal variations and, in 
rabbit foetuses, malformations of the ribs and vertebrae. In both species, effects of luspatercept 
were observed in the EFD studies at the lowest dose tested, 5 mg/kg, which corresponds to an 
estimated exposure in rats and rabbits of approximately 2.7 and 5.5 times greater, respectively, 
than the estimated clinical exposure.  
Pre- and post-natal development 
In a pre- and post-natal development study, with dose levels of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg administered 
once every 2 weeks from gestational day (GD) 6 through post-natal day (PND) 20, adverse 
findings at all doses consisted of lower FR1R pup body weights in both sexes at birth, throughout 
lactation, and post weaning (PND 28); lower body weights during the early premating period 
(Week 1 and 2) in the FR1R females (adverse only at the 30 mg/kg/dose) and lower body weights 
in FR1R males during the premating, pairing and post-mating periods; and microscopic kidney 
findings in FR1R pups. Additionally, non-adverse findings included delayed male sexual 
maturation at the 10 and 30 mg/kg/dose. The delay in growth and the adverse kidney findings, 
in the FR1R generation, precluded the determination of a NOAEL for FR1R general and 
developmental toxicity. However, there was no effect on behavioural indices, fertility or 
reproductive parameters at any dose level in either sex, therefore the NOAEL for behavioural 
assessments, fertility and reproductive function in the FR1R animals was considered to be the 
30 mg/kg/dose. Luspatercept is transferred through the placenta of pregnant rats and rabbits and 
is excreted into the milk of lactating rats. 
Juvenile toxicity 
In a study in juvenile rats, luspatercept was administered from postnatal day (PND) 7 to PND 91 
at 0, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg. Many of the findings seen in repeat-dose toxicity studies in adult rats 
were repeated in the juvenile rats. These findings included glomerulonephritis in the kidney, 
haemorrhage/congestion, necrosis and mineralization of the adrenal gland, mucosal 
mineralization in the stomach, lower heart weights, and swollen hindlimbs/feet. Luspatercept-
related findings unique to juvenile rats included tubular atrophy/hypoplasia of the kidney inner 
medulla, delays in the mean age of sexual maturation in males, effects on reproductive 
performance (lower mating indices), and non-adverse decreases in bone mineral density in both 
male and female rats. The effects on reproductive performance were observed after a greater 
than 3-month recovery period, suggesting a permanent effect. Although reversibility of the 
tubular atrophy/hypoplasia was not examined, these effects are also considered to be 
irreversible. Adverse effects on the kidney and reproductive system were observed at clinically 
relevant exposure levels and seen at the lowest dose tested and, thus, an NOAEL was not 
established. In addition, haematological malignancies were observed in 3 out of 44 rats 
examined in the highest dose group (10 mg/kg). These findings are all considered potential risks 
in paediatric patients.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Reblozyl is and what it is used for 
Reblozyl contains the active substance luspatercept. It is used for:  
Myelodysplastic syndromes 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a collection of many different blood and bone marrow 
disorders.  
• 
• 
Red blood cells become abnormal and do not develop properly.  
Patients can get a number of signs and symptoms including a low red blood cell count 
(anaemia) and may need red blood cell transfusions.  
Reblozyl is used in adults with anaemia caused by MDS, who need red blood cell transfusions. 
It is used in adults who have already had or are not able to have erythropoietin therapies. 
Beta-thalassaemia 
β-thalassaemia is a blood problem that is passed down through genes.  
• 
• 
It affects the production of haemoglobin.  
Patients can get a number of signs and symptoms including a low red blood cell count 
(anaemia) and may need red blood cell transfusions. 
Reblozyl is used to treat anaemia in adults with β-thalassaemia who may or may not need 
regular red blood cell transfusions. 
How Reblozyl works 
Reblozyl improves your body’s ability to make red blood cells. Red blood cells contain 
haemoglobin, which is a protein that carries oxygen throughout your body. As your body makes 
more red blood cells, your haemoglobin level increases. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For MDS and β-thalassaemia patients in need of regular blood transfusions  
Having Reblozyl can avoid or reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. 
• 
Red blood cell transfusions can cause abnormally high levels of iron in the blood and in 
different organs of the body. This can be harmful over time. 
For β-thalassaemia patients not in need of regular blood transfusions  
Having Reblozyl can improve your aneamia by increasing your haemoglobin level.  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Reblozyl 
Do not use Reblozyl 
• 
if you are allergic to luspatercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
if you are pregnant (see section on Pregnancy) 
if you require treatment for the control of mass producing blood cells outside the bone 
marrow (extramedullary haemopoiesis masses, EMH masses) 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before being given this medicine if: 
• 
hormone replacement therapy or  
a previous blood clot  
you are a β-thalassaemia patient and you have had your spleen removed. You may have a 
higher risk of getting a blood clot. Your doctor will talk to you about other possible risk 
factors that may increase your risk – these include: 
o 
o 
Your doctor may use preventive measures or medicines to reduce the chances of you 
getting a blood clot. 
you have severe back pain that does not go away, numbness or weakness or loss of 
voluntary movement in legs, hands or arms, loss of bowel and bladder control 
(incontinence). They may be symptoms of EMH masses and compression of spinal cord.  
you have ever had high blood pressure – this is because Reblozyl may increase it. Your 
blood pressure will be checked before you are given Reblozyl and throughout treatment. 
You will be given Reblozyl only if your blood pressure is under control. 
you have a condition that affects the strength and health of your bones (osteopenia and 
osteoporosis). You may have a risk of breaking your bones more easily.  
Routine tests 
You will have a blood test before each dose of this medicine. This is because your doctor needs 
to make sure your haemoglobin level is suitable for you to be given treatment. 
If you have kidney problems, your doctor may perform additional tests. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. 
Other medicines and Reblozyl 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy 
• 
Do not use this medicine during pregnancy and for at least 3 months before getting 
pregnant. Reblozyl may cause harm to your unborn baby. 
Your doctor will arrange a pregnancy test before starting treatment and will give you a 
patient card. 
If you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine.

Do not freeze the reconstituted solution. 
Dose calculation 
The total dose, according to the patient’s weight (kg) can be calculated as follow: 
Total dose (mg) = Dose level (mg/kg) x patient’s weight (kg) every three weeks. 
Reconstitution instructions 
Reblozyl is supplied as a lyophilised powder to be reconstituted with water for injections (WFI). 
A syringe with appropriate graduations must be used for reconstitution to ensure accurate 
dosage. See Table 1.

Remove the coloured cap from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol wipe.  
Add WFI into the vial by means of a syringe with appropriate graduations with a needle 
directing the flow onto the lyophilised powder. Allow to stand for one minute. 
Discard the needle and syringe used for reconstitution. Do not use them for subcutaneous 
injection. 
Gently swirl the vial in a circular motion for 30 seconds. Stop swirling and let the vial sit 
in an upright position for 30 seconds. 
Inspect the vial for undissolved powder in the solution. If undissolved powder is 
observed, repeat step 4 until the powder is completely dissolved.

Invert the vial and gently swirl in an inverted position for 30 seconds. Bring the vial back 
to the upright position and let it sit for 30 seconds. 
Repeat step 6 seven more times to ensure complete reconstitution of material on the sides 
of the vial. 
Visually inspect the reconstituted solution prior to administration. When properly mixed, 
Reblozyl reconstituted solution is a colourless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly 
opalescent solution which is free of visible foreign particulate matter. Do not use if 
undissolved product or foreign particulate matter is observed. 
If the reconstituted solution is not used immediately, see Storage of the product section 
above. 
Method of administration 
If the Reblozyl reconstituted solution has been refrigerated, remove from the refrigerator 
15-30 minutes prior to injection to allow it to reach room temperature. This will allow for a 
more comfortable injection. 
The recommended maximum volume of medicinal product per injection site is 1.2 mL. If more 
than 1.2 mL is required, the total volume of Reblozyl should be divided into separate similar 
volume injections and administered across separate sites using the same anatomical location but 
on opposite sides of the body. Reconstitute the appropriate number of Reblozyl vials to achieve 
the desired dose. 
Inject Reblozyl subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. 
If multiple injections are required, use a new syringe and needle for each subcutaneous 
injection. Discard a11Tny unused portion. Do not administer more than one dose from a vial11T. 
Disposal 
Dispose of any unused medicinal product or waste material in accordance with local 
requirements.

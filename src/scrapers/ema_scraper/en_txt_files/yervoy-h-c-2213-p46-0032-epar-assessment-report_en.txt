1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
Submission  of  final  study  report  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  regulation  (EC)  N0  1901/2006  of 
study  NCI7458-CA184070:  Open  label,  dose  escalation  clinical  trial  of  intravenously  administered 
ipilimumab in patients with untreatable, refractory or relapsed solid malignant tumours.  
After  review  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  data  do  not  support  the 
requirement  for  a  variation  of  the  SmPC.  However,  a  variation  of  the  currently  approved  Paediatric 
Investigational Program (PIP) after consultation with the PDCO is recommended.

EMEA/H/C/002213-EU/1/11/698/001-002 
Ipilimumab (BMS-734016, MDX-010, YERVOY®) is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1κ 
specific  for  human  cytotoxic  T  lymphocyte  antigen  4  (CTLA-4).  CTLA-4  is  a  key  regulator  of  T-cell 
activity.  Ipilimumab  is  a  CTLA-4  immune  checkpoint  inhibitor  that  blocks  T-cell  inhibitory  signals 
induced  by  the  CTLA-4  pathway,  increasing  the  number  of  tumor  reactive  T-effector  cells,  which 
mobilize to mount a direct T-cell immune attack against tumor cells. CTLA-4 blockade can also reduce 
T-regulatory cell function, which may lead to an increase in anti-tumor immune response. Ipilimumab 
may selectively deplete T-regulatory cells at the tumor site, leading to an increase in the intratumoral 
T-effector/T-regulatory cell ratio, which drives tumor cell death. 
Ipilimumab is currently approved for adults in European Union (EU), the United States (US) and other 
countries for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma at a dose of 3 mg/kg 
administered intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses. 
This  PAM  concerns  the  assessment  of  the  final  report  of  the  NCI7458-CA184070  (submitted  in 
accordance  of  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  N  1901/2006),  a  dose  escalation  study  performed  with 
ipilimumab  in  children,  adolescents,  and  young  adults  affected  by  untreatable,  relapsed  or  refractory 
solid tumors.  
According to the Ipilimumab Pediatric Development Program, other two studies in melanoma patients 
are currently ongoing:

-Study CA184178: a Phase 2 study of ipilimumab in children and adolescents (12 to <18 years) with 
previously  treated  or  untreated  Stage  III  or  Stage  IV  malignant  melanoma,  being  conducted  by  the 
MAH. 
-Study  E1609  (also  known  as  CA184116):  a  Phase  3  randomized  study  of  adjuvant  ipilimumab  anti-
CTLA-4 therapy vs high-dose interferon α-2b for resected high-risk melanoma, with the cooperation of 
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). 
One other study is planned: 
-  A  Phase  2  study  of  ipilimumab  in  pediatric  subjects,  0  to  <18  years  with  solid  malignant  tumors, 
based on the results of study NCI7458/CA184070.

Table 1: Ipilimumab Pediatric Development Program 
An  initial  Pediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  for  all  conditions  in  the  category  of  malignant  neoplasms 
except  melanoma,  nervous  system,  haematopoietic  and  lymphoid  tissue  (EMEA-000117-PIP01-07),

and one for the treatment of the condition of melanoma (EMEA-000117-PIP02-10) was provided to the 
European  Medicines  Agency's  (EMA)  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO)  in  2007  and  2010,  respectively. 
Feedback  on  the  pediatric  development  program  for  ipilimumab  was  provided  by  the  PDCO  in  the 
decisions  after  submission  of  the  initial  PIPs  and  in  opinions  and  decisions  rendered  for  Requests  for 
Modification  (RfM)  to  the  initial  PIP  for  the  category  of  malignant  neoplasms  (except  melanoma, 
nervous system, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue) and for the PIP for melanoma. 
BMS  was  initially  granted  a  waiver  by  the  US  Food  &  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  based  on 
21CFR314.55,  which  states  that  any  drug  for  an  indication  or  indications  for  which  orphan  product 
designation has been granted are exempt from pediatric studies typically required under the Pediatric 
Research Equity Act. The FDA granted ipilimumab orphan-product designation (03-1777) on 03-June-
2004 for "treatment of high-risk Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV melanoma.” BMS had a subsequent 
meeting with the FDA on 28-Aug-2012 to discuss a pediatric development plan for ipilimumab and to 
obtain guidance on the content of a Proposed Pediatric Study Request (PPSR). At FDA’s request, BMS 
provided  a  revised  PPSR  in  2013  to  provide  additional  information  to  support  extrapolation  of  adult 
efficacy  data  for  the  development  of  ipilimumab  in  advanced  melanoma  in  the  adolescent  population 
(ages 12 to 18), which would be supported by data from studies NCI7458/CA184070 and CA184178. 
Based on FDA feedback on the 2013 PPSR, BMS submitted a new PPSR in 2014, in which a change in 
dose from 10 to 3 mg/kg and removal of maintenance treatment (every 12-weeks) were introduced for 
study CA184178. 
STUDY NCI7458 (or CA184070) 
Study NCI7458 (or CA1840701) was a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation (doses of 1, 
3,  5  and  10  mg/kg)  study  conducted  with  ipilimumab  in  children,  adolescents,  and  young  adults, 
ranging  in  age  from  1  to  21  year  with  untreatable,  relapsed  or  refractory  solid  malignant  tumors 
(including  melanoma)  without  a  curative  option  with  standard  therapy.  The  rationale  for  studying 
ipilimumab in pediatric solid tumors was based on the hypothesis that 1) existent immune responses 
are  present  in  pediatric  patients  with  tumors,  but  tumor  immune  escape  diminishes  the  potency  of 
such  responses  leading  to  inadequate  control,  and  that  2)  the  anti-CTLA-4  activity  provided  by 
ipilimumab would augment immune responses to tumors in the pediatric population, thereby improving 
clinical outcomes. Based on the activity of ipilimumab against melanoma in adults, similar activity was 
hypothesized  in  the  pediatric  population,  given  the  similarity  of  the  immune  system  in  adults  and 
pediatric  subjects.  The  study  was  conducted  under  the  supervision  of  the  Pediatric  Oncology  Branch 
(POB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  
Study Design 
The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the  toxicity  profile  and  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  of 
ipilimumab  at  a  range  of  doses  up  to,  but  not  exceeding,  the  highest  dose  tolerated  in  adults  in 
subjects  ≤  21  years  of  age  with  untreatable,  refractory  or  relapsed  solid  malignant  tumors.  The 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of ipilimumab was also evaluated. 
Secondary  objectives  included  evaluation  of  antitumor  activity  (in  terms  of  ORR)  and  of  the 
immunomodulatory (pharmacodynamics) activity of ipilimumab. 
Ipilimumab was administered intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 
cycles in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or disease progression. From Cycle 5 onward (with 
Cycle  5  at  Week  12),  ipilimumab  was  administered  approximately  every  12  weeks  (maintenance 
dosing). Ipilimumab doses ranging from 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg in 4 dose levels (1, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg) 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

were planned. Three to 6 subjects were to be enrolled at each dose level. If none of the first 3 subjects 
who were evaluable for toxicity at a given dose level had a DLT within 6 weeks following the first dose 
date, dose escalation was performed. No intra-subject dose escalation was allowed. If a DLT related to 
ipilimumab was observed in 1 subject from a cohort of 3 subjects at a given dose level, an additional 3 
subjects  were  to  be  entered  at  that  dose  level.  If  none  of  these  additional  subjects  experienced  a 
DLT(≤1/6  with  DLT),  the  dose  of  ipilimumab  was  to  be  escalated.  However,  if  ≥1  of  the  additional 
subjects  experienced  a  DLT  (≥2/6  with  DLT),  the  highest  dose  tolerated  was  determined  to  be 
exceeded,  and  the  next  lower  dose  level  would  be  considered  the  highest  tolerated  dose  for 
ipilimumab. The cohort of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was to be expanded to enroll a total of 
12 patients.  
Because  there  appeared  to  be  a  different  toxicity  profile  in  subjects  <12  years  old,  the  expansion 
cohort  of  10  mg/kg  was  divided  into  2  cohorts  in  2011.  As  a  result,  the  5  mg/kg  dose  cohort  was 
expanded to a total of 14 subjects that included 6 subjects <12 years, and the 10 mg/kg dose cohort 
was expanded to include more subjects ≥12 years old. 
Re-induction therapy (ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) was allowed: a) in patients experiencing 
disease progression during the maintenance phase; b) in patients who stopped the maintenance phase 
due  to  complete  response  and  subsequently  experienced  disease  progression;  c)  in  patients  with  an 
initial  partial  response  (PR),  CR,  or  stable  disease  (SD)  for  at  least  3  months  with  subsequent 
progression.  
All  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  ipilimumab  were  considered  evaluable  for  safety.  The 
maximum study duration was 2 years total duration of therapy. 
Dose-limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  was  defined  as  a  drug-related  AE  according  to  the  National  Cancer 
Institute  (NCI)  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE),  Version  3.0  until  31-July-
2010 and Version 4.0 from 1-August-2010, that occurred during induction with ipilimumab: 
  Non-hematologic  DLT:  any  non-hematologic  Grade  3  or  4  toxicity  or  Grade  2  toxicity  requiring 
immunosuppressive  or  hormone  replacement  therapy  judged  to  be  at  least  possibly  related  to 
ipilimumab. 
 Hematologic DLT: Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, which persisted for 5 days at any time 
during the treatment cycle or any grade 5 toxicity at least possibly attributable to ipilimumab. Grade 3 
hematologic toxicity was not considered dose limiting. 
The  MTD  of  ipilimumab  was  defined  as  the  dose  level  immediately  below  the  dose  level  at  which  ≥2 
subjects in a cohort (dose level) of two to 6 patients experienced a DLT attributable to ipilimumab. 
Immune-related AEs were defined using a predefined list of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) high-level group terms, high-level terms, and preferred terms (PTs). 
The  development  of  immune  function  was  to  be  evaluated  prior  to  all  cycles,  based  on  the  following 
laboratory  tests:  Rheumatoid  factor,  anti-nuclear  antibody  (ANA).  If  ANA  values  were  positive  (>2) 
subsequent to baseline evaluation, the following tests were also to be performed prior to all cycles of 
ipilimumab  treatment:  anticardiolipin  antibody  (ACA),  anti-neutrophil  cytoplasmic  antibody  (ANCA), 
complement  3  (C3),  C4,  anti-deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA),  anti-Sjögren's  syndrome  (SS)A,  and  anti-
SSB. 
Corticosteroids (oral or IV) could be used for treatment of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). In 
addition,  alternative 
immunosuppressive 
therapies  (e.g., 
infliximab,  mycophenolate  mofetil, 
tacrolimus) could be used to treat irAEs that do not respond to initial steroid therapy.

Results 
Disposition and Baseline/Demographic Characteristics 
A total of 33 patients were enrolled: 13 (39.4%) of the 33 subjects in the study were <12 years old 
and 20 (60.6%) were ≥12 years. No subjects were ≥1 and <2 years old. All patients were treated at 3 
study sites in the United States. 
Overall, 57.6% of subjects were  female and 69.7% Whites.  Most (92.9% of  subjects in the 5 mg/kg 
group were female, and in the 10 mg/kg group, most were male (76.9%). Overall, 39.4% were <12 
years old and 60.6% were ≥12 years. The minimum  age was 2.4 years; one subject in the 3 mg/kg 
group was 21.8 years old. All subjects had baseline Lansky/Karnofsky scores ≥50, as required by the 
inclusion criteria. 
Table 2. Demographic and baseline characteristics by dose level. 
Melanoma was the most common tumor type (12/33 subjects), followed by osteosarcoma (n=8), soft 
tissue  sarcoma  (n=7),  renal  cell  of  the  kidney  (n=1),  clear  cell  of  the  kidney  (n=1),  neuroblastoma 
(n=1),  and  solid  tumor  not  otherwise  specified  (NOS)  (n=3).  all  subjects  had  received  anti-cancer 
treatment  prior  to  enrollment.  All  subjects  had  prior  surgery.  Among  subjects  with  prior  radiation,  1 
had  extensive  radiation,  4  limited  radiation,  and  13  radiation  (NOS).  All  12  melanoma  subjects  were 
treated  with  IL-2  or  interferon  (IFN)  alpha  prior  to  enrollment,  and  most  of  the  subjects  with  other 
tumor  types  (63.6%)  were  treated  with  standard  multi-agent  chemotherapy  regimens  for  their 
particular  tumor  type.  The  subject  with  a  neuroblastoma  was  enrolled  and  treated  following  an 
autologous stem cell rescue.

CHMP’s comment  
According to the demographic baseline characteristics, no patients were enrolled in the study with age 
< 2.4 years.  
Safety 
Dose escalation 
At  doses  of  1  and  3  mg/kg,  3  subjects  each  were  enrolled,  regardless  of  age  group.  Since  no  DLTs 
were observed, the dose was escalated to 5 mg/kg. 
At 5 mg/kg, the first cohort of subjects to assess DLT’s was 4 instead of 3. The second subject enrolled 
died of progressive disease before 6 weeks on study and was not evaluable. Therefore, the subject was 
replaced  by  another  subject  at  this  dose  level.  Since  only  the  4th  subject  treated  at  5  mg/kg 
experienced  a  DLT,  an  additional  3  subjects  were  enrolled  at  this  dose;  however,  as  none  of  these 
experienced a DLT, the dose was escalated to 10 mg/kg. 
At 10 mg/kg, one of the first 3 subjects enrolled experienced a DLT within 6 weeks of first dose; this 
subject was <12 year old. Since a DLT was reported for <2 of the 3 subjects enrolled and treated at 10 
mg/kg, additional subjects were enrolled into the 10 mg/kg dose group. A second subject <12 year old 
experienced  at  10  mg/kg,  as  enrolment  continued  into  this  dose  cohort.  Therefore,  the  protocol  was 
amended  to  limit  further  treatment  of  subjects  <12  year  old  to  the  5  mg/kg  dose,  thereby  limiting 
expansion of treatment at 10 mg/kg to subjects ≥12 years old. Shortly thereafter, the first DLT in  a 
subject ≥12 years old was reported. 
Dose expansion phase by age 
Since no young children had been enrolled in the 5 mg/kg dose cohort, after escalation to 10 mg/kg, 
an amendment  was put in place  to enroll 6  additional  subjects <12 years at the 5 mg/kg dose. This 
expansion allowed further exploration of safety and PK at these age group to determine if 5 mg/kg was 
a  tolerated  dose  for  <12-year-old  age  group.  By  the  time  the  MTD  for  subjects  <12  years  old  was 
established,  and  further  treatment  had  been  separated  by  age  groups,  and  the  10  mg/kg  dose  level 
was  expanded  to  enroll  additional  subjects  ≥12  years  old,  besides  the  initial  3  subjects  need  to 
establish the highest tolerated dose tested, 4 subjects <12 years old had been treated at 10 mg/kg. 
Additional subjects ≥12 years old were needed to allow further exploration at this dose, and therefore, 
6 additional subjects ≥12 years old were enrolled into the 10 mg/kg group for a total of additional 9 
subjects during the dose expansion phase.

CHMP’s comment  
The applied dose escalation and expansion schema is considered acceptable. However, in view of the 
PK results of the CA184070 study and the  observed  activity of ipilimumab in adults at 3 mg/kg dose 
(currently  recommended  dose  regimen  in  adults)  an  expansion  cohort  at  3  mg/kg  dose  would  have 
been appropriate too, in order to allow a better evaluation of tolerability and potential activity signals 
of the drug at this dose.  
Safety results 
Ipilimumab was reasonably well tolerated in  CA184070 study. The safety profile observed  in  patients 
≤21 years of age appears in line with the known safety profile of ipilimumab as reported in adults. No 
new safety signals were identified in paediatric patients. 
No DLTs were identified in the 1 and 3 mg/kg dose cohorts. The MTD was determined to be 5 mg/kg in 
subjects ≥1 to <12 years old, and 10 mg/kg was the highest tolerated dose tested for subjects ≥12 to 
≤21 years old in this study. 
Adverse Events (AEs) 
Ipilimumab  treatment  was  tolerated  and  the  AE  profile  in  this  study  was  similar  to  that  seen  in  the 
adult  studies.  Serious  AEs  were  reported  for  9  (64.3%)  of  14  subjects  in  the  5  mg/kg  group  and  5 
(38.5%) of 13 subjects in the 10 mg/kg group. Immune-related AEs (irAEs) of any grade in subjects 
who received at least one dose of ipilimumab were reported in 25 (76%) of the 33 subjects treated at 
all dose levels. Most were low grade. 
Most of the subjects in all treatment groups were discontinued due to progressive disease. A total of 8 
(24%) subjects (4 in the 5 mg/kg dose group and 4 in the 10 mg/kg dose group) were discontinued 
from the study because of a drug related AE (Grade 3 – 4). The AEs leading to discontinuation included 
anaphylactic  reaction,  autoimmune  disorder,  increased  amylase/lipase  (pancreatitis),  headache, 
diarrhoea, and pleural effusion with no single event occurring in more than 2 subjects. 
AEs reported at different dose levels were the following: 
-1 mg/kg and the 3 mg/kg dose cohorts: no AEs leading to discontinuation or severe (Grade 3-4) irAEs 
were reported in the  
- 5 mg/kg dose cohort (14 pts): 
o Related AEs were reported for most subjects (12/14), and half of them were severe (6/14); 
o  Severe  irAEs  were  reported  for  3  subjects  (1/6  <12years  old,  2/8  ≥12  years  old)  and  included 
anaphylactic reaction, amylase increased, lipase increased, ALT increased, and AST increased; 
o Four subjects had AEs leading to discontinuation (1/6 subject <12 years old, 3/8 subjects ≥12 years 
old): all but one of the events (vomiting) was considered a DLT. Events leading to discontinuation were 
anaphylactic reaction, diarrhoea, vomiting, ALT increased, and AST increased. 
- 10 mg/kg dose cohort (13 pts): 
o Related AEs were reported for most subjects (12/13), and half of them were severe (6/13); 
o  Severe  irAEs  were  reported  for  3  subjects  (2/4  <  12years  old,  1/9  ≥12  years  old)  and  included 
diarrhoea, ALT increased, and AST increased; 
o  Four  subjects  had  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  (2/4  subjects  <12  years  old,  2/9  subjects  ≥12 
years  old):  all  of  these  events  were  considered  a  DLT,  except  for  the  event  of  headache.  Events

leading  to  discontinuation  were  autoimmune  disorder,  abdominal  pain,  amylase  increased,  lipase 
increased, headache, diarrhoea, and pleural effusion.

CHMP’s comment  
The  number  of  patients  treated  with  ipilimumab  1mg/kg  and  3  mg/kg  is  too  low  to  allow  any 
conclusion  on  the  safety  profile  of  the  drug  in  the  paediatric  population  at  such  doses  administered. 
The absence of DLTs clearly suggests tolerability. Moreover overall the safety profile of ipilimumab as 
observed  in  this  study  appears  in  line  with  the  known  toxicity  of  the  drug  in  adults.  No  new  safety 
signals  are  observed  in  the  paediatric  population  also  in  terms  of  irAEs.  Nevertheless,  as  already 
observed in adults, the toxicity of the drug is substantial with several severe and life threatening AEs. 
DLT 
A total of thirteen subjects <12 years of age and 20 subjects ≥12 years were treated with ipilimumab. 
The highest tolerated dose tested was different between subjects <12 years old and ≥12 years old. 
o  For  subjects  ≥1  to  <12  years  old,  the  MTD  was  determined  to  be  5  mg/kg.  Tolerability  of  the  5 
mg/kg dose in this age group was confirmed by expansion of the cohort to a total of 13 subjects. DLTs 
were observed in: 
- 1 of a total of 6 subjects in this age group treated with 5 mg/kg (anaphylactic reaction); 
- 2 of a total of 4 subjects in this age group treated with 10 mg/kg cohort (diarrhoea; increased 
ALT/AST).

o  The  highest  tolerated  dose  tested  for  subjects  ≥12  to  ≤21  years  old  was  10  mg/kg.  DLTs  were 
observed in: 
- 2 of a total of 8 subjects in this age group treated with 5 mg/kg (amylase increased and abdominal 
pain; autoimmune disorder); 
- 2 of a total of 9 subjects in this age group treated with 10 mg/kg (pleural effusion; diarrhoea). 
For  older  children  (>12  years  of  age),  10  mg/kg  was  established  in  this  study  as  the  highest  tested 
tolerated  dose  and  the  dose  cohort  of  10  mg/kg  was  therefore  further  expanded  for  this  older  age 
group. 
CHMP’s comment  
The results of the study suggest different maximum tolerated doses of ipilimumab at different ages. In 
particular,  in  patients  <12  years  old  the  MTD  of  ipilimumab  appears  to  be  5  mg/kg,  whereas  in 
patients ≥12 to ≤21 years old the maximum evaluated ipilimumab dose and reported to be tolerable is 
10 mg/kg. However, the PK data show adequate levels of drug exposure at 3 mg/kg dose already and 
a signal of activity was observed in a patient >12  years old treated with ipilimumab 5 mg/kg. These 
raise  discussion  over  the  appropriate  dose  to  be  used  for  further  clinical  testing  in  the  paediatric 
population. Unfortunately the results of the CA184169 and CA184178 studies (comparing efficacy and 
safety of ipilimumab 3mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg in adults and paediatric (≥ 12  -≤ 18 years old) melanoma 
patients, respectively, are currently not available. 
Immune-related AEs (irAEs) and 
Immune-related  AEs  of  any  grade  in  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  ipilimumab  were 
reported in 25 (76%) of 33 of subjects treated at all dose levels. No irAEs ≥Grade 3 were reported for 
any subject treated with 1 or 3 mg/kg dose group, and 3 (21%) of 14 subjects treated with 5 mg/kg 
and 3 (23%) of 13 subjects treated with 10 mg/kg reported Grade 3 to 4 events. None were fatal. 
The types of irAEs  were also consistent with the  adult experience, with the  most  commonly reported 
irAEs  across  all  groups  being  in  the  categories  of  gastrointestinal  (n=12/33  pts,  including  2  severe 
events of which 1 GI perforation), liver (n=11/33 pts, including 2 Grade 3 increase AST/ALT), and skin 
(n=9/33  pts,  all  low  grade)  events.  Grade  3  or  4  increase  in  serum  lipase  and  amylase  laboratory 
values were reported for 2 of 33 pts and were consistent with clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis.No new 
or  unexpected  irAEs  were  observed  in  pediatric  subjects.  Similar  to  the  results  of  studies  in  adults, 
while the proportion of subjects with irAEs increased with higher doses, there was no difference in the 
spectrum of irAEs reported. While 10 mg/kg did not appear to be tolerable in the younger age group, 
the  safety  profile  at  lower  doses,  including  5  mg/kg,  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of 
ipilimumab, including the frequency and types of irAEs.  Immune-related adverse  events in  this study 
were managed using treatment algorithms previously established for adult subjects. 
Immune and Endocrine Function 
Three of the 33 subjects in the study had  ANA values >2 and 2 of the 33 subjects had  elevations of 
rheumatoid factor. None appeared to be clinically relevant. 
Three  of  33  subjects  treated  in  this  study  reported  abnormal  endocrine  laboratory  values  that  were 
diagnostic for an endocrine disorder.

Deaths 
Overall, death due to malignant disease was reported for 15 subjects in this study as of the database 
lock. Two deaths occurred within 30 days of last dose. No subjects died from study drug toxicity and 
no deaths were attributed as related to study drug toxicity by the investigator. 
CHMP’s Comment  
The data regarding irAEs and deaths appears in line with what reported in the adult population. No new 
safety signal is observed. 
Pharmacokinetics  
In Study CA184070, ipilimumab IV was rapidly absorbed and there appeared to be little difference 
observed in mean Tmax values between either the age or dose cohorts in pediatric subjects. There 
were also no apparent differences in concentration-time profiles in this study between the paediatric 
age cohorts of <12 (N=13) and 12 years old (N=20), regardless of dose level (see 
Figure 1 and Figure 2). Mean serum T-half values ranged from 7 to 15 days.

and <21 Years Old - Linear Scale (CA184070) 
Based on the results of this study, the pediatric data suggest that the exposure of ipilimumab (eg, 
AUC, Cmax, and Cmin) increased approximately in proportion with doses ranging from 3 to 10 mg/kg, 
although the data with the 3mg/kg are limited (N=3). 
Ipilimumab exposure of pediatric subjects in study CA184070 appeared to be consistent with exposure 
in adults, based on comparison with pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg in adults from studies  
CA184007 & CA184008 in the application dossier (Table 1). There was no apparent difference in Cmax, 
AUC0-21, Ctrough between children (2 and <12 years), adolescents (2 and <18 years), and adults.

CHMP’s comment  
Bioanalysis of ipilimumab is adequate, 93.5% of the ISR samples met acceptance criteria.  
Results from pediatric study CA184070 indicated that pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab is comparable in 
pediatric patients and adults when dosed by mg/kg. The elimination half-life seemed somewhat longer 
in  pediatric  patients<12  years  compared  to  older  patients  but  in  the  application  dossier  a  half-life  of 
ipilimumab  between  10  and  17  days  was  reported  for  adults.  The  results  from  this  study  imply  that 
compared  to  the  approved  3mg/kg  ipilimumab  in  adults,  the  pediatric  patients  will  likely  obtainan 
adequate ipilimumab exposure to allow for interpretation of safety and efficacy data. Safety differences 
observed for the <12 year old subjects do not appear to be due to differences in PK.  
Pharmacodynamics 
In Study CA184070, pre-treatment and on-treatment measurements of ALC and activated CD4+ and 
CD8+ T-cells from whole blood were analyzed to demonstrate immunomodulating pharmacodynamic 
effects of ipilimumab treatment. Samples were taken from all 33 subjects in the study, but due to the 
limited number of subjects in the 1 and 3 mg/kg dose cohorts, summaries and figures were only 
provided for subjects in the 5 and 10 mg/kg dose cohorts. Data for ALC for the first 3 cycles are 
presented in Table 2.

Table 2 Effect of ipilimumab on Absolute Lymphocyte Counts in pediatric patients 
treated with 5 mg/kg upper panel or 10 mg/kg lower panel (study CA184070) 
Mean ALC increased following 2 doses of ipilimumab treatment in the 3, 5 and 10 mg/kg groups in this 
study, with a more pronounced increase in the 10 mg/kg group. This increase is indicative of a 
pharmacodynamic effect of ipilimumab; however, interpretation of dose dependency is limited by the 
small numbers of subjects with ALC measurements at Day 1 of Cycle 3 in all dose groups. Likewise,

results for correlation of ALC with Grade 3 to 5 irAEs were inconclusive for both the 5 and 10 mg/kg 
cohorts, based on the low number of subjects experiencing a severe irAE. 
In clinical studies in adults with advanced melanoma, the majority of treated subjects experienced a 
rise in ALC during the induction dosing period. This observed increase was dose-dependent, was not 
observed in the control group (gp100 vaccine) of the pivotal Phase 3 study (MDX010-201), was 
positively and significantly associated with overall survival in adults. 
Assessments of the absolute number of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood and 
change from baseline by study day were made on Day 1 of Cycle 1, and Day 1 of Cycle 2. The 
activated CD4+ T cells increased from baseline in both the 5 and 10 mg/kg dose cohorts (Table 3). No 
meaningful change in activated CD8+ T cells was observed. Due to the limited number of subjects per 
cohort (3 subject in each), summaries of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the 1 and 3 mg/kg dose 
cohorts are not presented. 
Due to the limited number of subjects per cohort (3 subject in each), summaries of peripheral CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells in the 1 and 3 mg/kg dose cohorts are not presented (refer to Appendix 9.1 of the 
Final CSR for NCI7458/CA184070).

CHMP’s comment  
In  the  10  mg/kg  group,  mean  ALC  increased  following  2  doses  of  ipilimumab  treatment,  however, 
there was no consistent increase in ALC in the 5 mg/kg group.  
As can be seen in Table 3 , the intersubject variability for the absolute values for CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells was very high with ranges of 37-2411 and 61-1362, respectively. It is not known if the effect of 
ipilimumab is influenced by the absolute value of T cells. In this study, an increase in activated CD4+ T 
cells but no increase in activated CD8+ T cells from baseline was observed in pediatric subjects in both 
the 5 and 10 mg/kg dose  cohorts. Comparison  with  adult data is hampered because  in this pediatric 
study the absolute values of T cell subsets were evaluated rather than the relative expression as was 
the  case  in  adults.  In  adult  subjects  treated  with  ipilimumab,  a  more  pronounced  pharmacodynamic 
effect on activated CD4+ T cells relative to activated CD8+ T cells has been observed. 
Pharmacodynamic markers in this study in pediatric patients were in line with observations in adults. 
However, the number (N=3) of pediatric patients treated data with the approved 3 mg/kg is too small 
to draw any conclusion with regards to similar dose response in pediatric patients as in adults.   
Immunogenicity 
Among available data for 33 subjects in the study, 1 subject (7458-NCI-16) in the 10 mg/kg group had 
a  HAHA  positive  result  at  baseline  and  1  subject  (7458-NCI-27)  in  the  5  mg/kg  group  had  a  HAHA 
positive results on Day 1 (sample collected 15 minutes into the infusion). No subjects were considered 
to be positive up to 26 weeks after ipilimumab  treatment. Based on these  results, no  summaries for 
neutralizing antibodies were presented. 
CHMP’s comment  
No subjects are considered to be positive for an anti-ipilimumab antibody (human anti-human antibody 
[HAHA]) response up to 26 weeks after ipilimumab treatment. 
Efficacy 
Subjects were considered evaluable for tumor response if they completed at least one cycle of therapy, 
or if they experienced progressive disease prior to that time. Results must be interpreted with caution 
based on the small sample size, heterogeneity of the tumors included, and limited follow up in subjects 
who discontinued for AEs. However, exposure was adequate based on PK. 
None  of  the  subjects  reached  an  objective  response  (PR  or  CR)  per  RECIST  criteria.  Eleven  subjects 
had SD as the best overall response (BOR). All subjects with SD were treated at doses >1 mg/kg (the 
minimum dose established to be effective for advanced melanoma in adults). Only 1 of the 13 subjects 
<12 years old achieved SD. Stable disease was achieved in 2 of 12 subjects with melanoma, and 9 of 
the 21 subjects with other types of solid tumors. Of 9 subjects with SD in subjects with non-melanoma 
solid tumors, 2 were unconfirmed.  
Overall, stable disease was of short duration for most subjects. Stable disease >6 months duration was 
observed in 2 subjects. One subject with melanoma (7458-NCI-9) achieved a duration of SD for nearly 
2 years (>22 months). The other subject had an unspecified solid tumor (7458-NCI-14) and although 
SD was achieved, disease progressed within 7 months. 
In most cases of non-melanoma patients that achieved SD, SD was maintained for about 3 months or 
less,  and  for  3  of  the  9  patients  the  duration  of  SD  was  <  2  months.  For  4  of  the  9  non-melanoma

subjects  with  SD,  all  4  were  discontinued  due  to  an  AE  rather  than  disease  progression  and  did  not 
continue  tumor  assessment.  Therefore,  duration  of  SD  could  not  be  assessed  for  these  subjects.  Of 
note,  many  of  the  non-melanoma  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  were  known  with  protracted  disease 
course regardless of treatment. 
Best overall responses other than SD were: 
 PD (16 subjects; 7 of 13 subjects with melanoma, 9 of 21 subjects with non-melanoma, with study 
day of progression between Day 22 and Day 51); 
 assessment not evaluable/performed (subjects had only 1 infusion); one melanoma patient died due 
to disease progression on Day 7 after start of treatment. 
Conclusion according to the MAH: although no objective response was reported in any of the patients 
treated,  1  of  12  melanoma  patients  achieved  durable  stable  disease,  consistent  with  observation  in 
adults. This supports further evaluation of ipilimumab in paediatric and adolescent melanoma patients. 
In  view  of  the  very  limited  activity  observed  in  non-melanoma  patients,  considering  also  that  drug 
exposure  was  adequate  based  on  PK,  no  further  evaluation  of  ipilimumab  in  this  subsgroup  of  the 
population is warranted.  
CHMP’s comment  
According  to  the  data  provided,  no  significant  activity  has  been  observed  in  patients  with  non-
melanoma tumors. The limitations of the efficacy data presented, essentially related to the very limited 
number of patients enrolled in the different age groups, the heterogeneity of the cancer types and the 
different doses of ipilimumab administered, are acknowledged. However, we agree with the conclusion 
of  the  MAH  that  in  absence  of  an  efficacy  signal  despite  the  adequate  PK  exposure  to  study  drug, 
further investigation of ipilimumab as monotherapy in paediatric non-melanoma patients should not be 
performed at this time. 
Regarding the melanoma population, we agree that a signal of potential activity has been observed, as 
one  melanoma  patient  (7458-NCI-9)  achieved  a  duration  of  SD  for  nearly  2  years  (>22  months).  It 
should be noted that according to the data presented, this patient had age > 12 years and was treated 
with  an  ipilimumab  dose  of  5  mg/kg.  According  to  the  results  of  the  CA184070  study  the  maximum 
ipilimumab dose tested in patients > 12 years old and considered to be tolerable was 10 mg/kg. The 
activity  observed  in  the  patient  treated  with  5  mg/kg,  and  therefore  suggesting  anti-tumor  efficacy 
already at this dose, raises concerns over the appropriate dose to be use for further clinical testing in 
this patient subgroup, considering also that PK exposure was adequate also at ipilimumab doses < 10 
mg/kg  and  that  incidence  and  severity  of  adverse  events  appears  to  increase  at  higher  dose  of  the 
drug. 
It  should  be  noted  that in  adult  patients the  currently  recommended  dose  of  ipilimumab  is 3  mg/kg. 
Study CA184169 comparing efficacy and safety of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg in adult melanoma 
patients is currently ongoing. According to clinicaltrial.gov website the study has reached the planned 
accrual. The results of this study should be provided by the MAH as soon as available.    
Similarly, the results of the CA184178 study (comparing efficacy and safety of ipilimumab 3mg/kg vs 
10 mg/kg in paediatric (≥ 12 -≤ 18 years old) melanoma patients) are currently not available.

3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion 
Study  CA184070  (NCI7458)  was  a  phase  I,  multi-center,  dose  escalation  study,  in  order  to  evaluate 
safety,  maximum  tolerated  dose  and  PK  of  ipilimumab  in  children  and  young  adults  (≤21  years  old) 
with advanced solid tumors. Efficacy was evaluated as secondary endpoint. Of note, no children <2.4 
years  old  were  enrolled,  therefore  no  data  over  efficacy  and  safety  of  ipilimumab  are  currently 
available in this subgroup of the paediatric population. 
Overall,  despite  the  limitations  related  to  the  low  number  of  patients  enrolled,  the  safety  profile  of 
ipilimumab as observed in this study appears in line with the known toxicity of the drug in adults. No 
new  safety  signals  are  observed  in  the  paediatric  population  also  in  terms  of  irAEs.  Nevertheless,  as 
already  observed  in  adults,  the  toxicity  of  the  drug  is  substantial  with  several  severe  and  life 
threatening AEs. 
Moreover,  the  results  of  the  study  suggest  different  maximum  tolerated  doses  of  ipilimumab  at 
different ages. In particular, in patients <12 years old the MTD of ipilimumab appears to be 5 mg/kg, 
whereas in patients ≥12 to ≤21 years old the maximum evaluated ipilimumab dose and reported to be 
tolerable is 10 mg/kg. However, the PK data show comparable drug exposure between the age cohorts 
of <12 and 12 years old, regardless of dose level and there is a signal of activity observed in a patient 
>12 years old treated with ipilimumab 5 mg/kg.  These  findings raise  discussion over the appropriate 
dose to be used for further clinical testing in the melanoma paediatric population. Considering that in 
adult  patients  the  currently  recommended  dose  of  ipilimumab  is  3  mg/kg,  it  is  regrettable  that  the 
results of the CA184169 and CA184178 studies (comparing efficacy and safety of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg 
vs  10  mg/kg  in  adults  and  paediatric  (≥  12  -≤  18  years  old)  melanoma  patients,  respectively,  are 
currently not available. The MAH should discuss when the results of these studies can be expected. 
Finally,  although  the  limitations  of  the  efficacy  data  presented  are  acknowledged,  the  CHMP  agreed 
with the MAH that,  in absence  of an  efficacy  signal  despite the adequate PK exposure to study drug, 
further investigation of ipilimumab as monotherapy in paediatric non-melanoma patients seems not to 
be  reasonable,  at  this  time.  If  the  MAH  decides  not  to  continue  studying  ipilimumab  use  in  children 
below the age of 12 years, a modification of the currently approved Paediatric Investigational Program 
(PIP) should be applied with the PDCO. 
A variation of the currently approved PIP after consultation with the PDCO is also recommended before 
continuing on other studies in paediatric population. At the time of the discussion with the PDCO (and 
within  the  following  PSUR),  the  MAH  should  also  present  the  results  of  studies  CA184169  and/or 
CA184178 (comparing efficacy and safety of ipilimumab 3mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg in adults and paediatric 
(≥ 12  -≤ 18 years old) melanoma patients, respectively,  or state the  date when such results  will be 
available.  
In conclusion,  the  CHMP considered that  the data  presented  do not affect  the positive  benefit/risk of 
ipilimumab and there is no need for modification of the SmPC at the time of this report.

1.  Introduction 
On 4th February 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for 
Imipenem/Cilastatin/Relebactam (Recarbrio®), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
This is a stand-alone Article 46 submission. A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that  
Study P020MK7655A: Phase 1b, noncomparative, open-label, single IV dose study to evaluate the PK, 
safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam in paediatric participants from birth to less 
than 18 years of age with confirmed or suspected gram-negative infections 
is part of a paediatric clinical development program and is part of the PIP approved by the EMA (PIP 
EMEA-001809-PIP01-15-M02). The variation application consisting of the full relevant data package 
(i.e containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by the end of 2023. A line listing of all the 
concerned studies is annexed. 
IMI/REL was initially approved in the EU in February 2020 for the treatment of infections due to 
aerobic gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. Subsequently, in November 
2020, IMI/REL was approved by the European Commission for the additional indication for treatment of 
HAP, including VAP, in adults and bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be 
associated with HAP or VAP, in adults. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The formulation used in the submitted, completed study is the same single vial IMI/REL fixed-dose 
combination as was authorised in the EU for use in adults as of February 2020. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective: To obtain plasma PK data and characterize the PK profile of imipenem, cilastatin, 
and relebactam (REL) following administration of a single intravenous (IV) dose of IMI/REL in 
paediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age receiving standard-of-care antibacterial 
therapy for a confirmed or suspected gram-negative bacterial infection. 
Secondary objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of a single IV dose of IMI/REL in 
paediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age receiving standard-of-care antibacterial 
therapy for a confirmed or suspected gram-negative bacterial infection. 
Study design 
This was an open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and 
tolerability of MK-7655A (IMI/REL) and to identify the appropriate dose in paediatric participants from 
birth to less than 18 years of age receiving standard-of-care antibacterial therapy for treatment of a 
confirmed or suspected gram-negative bacterial infection. 
PK parameters were assessed for 6-12 hours following single IV dose and safety parameters were 
assessed for up to 24 hours, with a safety follow-up visit or telephone call at 14 ±2 days. 
Once the first 3 PK evaluable participants were enrolled in each of Cohorts 1 through 3, enrolment in 
that cohort was paused and an interim PK and safety review was performed to decide on the dose for 
the remaining half of the cohorts. An aggregate PK and safety interim review was conducted when 
enrolment was completed in Cohorts 1 through 3 to determine the initial dose for Cohorts 4 and 5. 
Enrolment in Cohorts 4 and 5 was also done in parallel and similar interim reviews were subsequently 
conducted.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints:  
•  REL: plasma PK exposures such as area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and 
maximum concentration (Cmax), PK parameters such as systemic clearance and central volume 
of distribution. 
• 
Imipenem: %fT>MIC, plasma PK exposures such as AUC and Cmax, PK parameters such as 
systemic clearance and central volume of distribution. 
•  Cilastatin: plasma PK exposures such as AUC and Cmax. 
Secondary endpoints:  
Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory evaluations, Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs), vital sign 
measurements, and physical examinations. 
Special attention was given to post-treatment visit (Visit 3) laboratory abnormalities, based on the 
toxicity grading, as described in the United States National Institutes of Health (US NIH) Division of 
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) paediatric toxicity scale. 
Statistical Methods 
Collected PK samples were analysed using noncompartmental PK analysis (cilastatin) and population 
PK modelling (imipenem and REL). Actual times were used for the PK analyses. Summary PK 
parameters for all analytes were derived by Cohort levels, as allowed by the data. 
Safety and tolerability were assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including incidence, 
severity, and type of AEs, changes in clinical laboratory tests, and changes from baseline in vital sign 
measurements at the interim reviews and the end of study. Descriptive and/or summary statistics 
were provided.

Table 2. Subject Disposition 
Source: CLINICAL STUDY REPORT P020MK7655A Table 10-1. 
A total of 46 treated participants received a single dose infusion of IMI/REL. 
Baseline data 
The majority of participants were female (59.6%), white (78.7%), and of non-Hispanic or Latino 
ethnicity (83.0%). Low mean creatine clearance observed among participants in Cohort 5 (<3 months 
of age) was most likely the result of functional immaturity of the developing newborn kidneys. 
The 4 most frequently reported medical history conditions in the safety population by PT included 
anaemia (19.6%), varicella infection (13.0%), respiratory failure (8.7%), and hypoxic-ischaemic 
encephalopathy (6.5%). The 4 most frequently reported prior medications in the safety population 
included acetaminophen (43.5%), ampicillin (23.9%), gentamicin (21.7%), and cefoperazone sodium 
(+) sulbactam sodium (21.7%). The 4 most frequently reported concomitant medications in the safety 
population included gentamicin (19.6%), acetaminophen (19.6%), dextrose (15.2%), and 
cholecalciferol (15.2%). 
Pharmacokinetic results 
4 PK samples were collected per participant at 4 different timepoints in each of the age cohorts for PK 
evaluation of imipenem, cilastatin, and REL. Plasma concentrations of imipenem, cilastatin, and REL 
and were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic tandem mass 
spectrometric method.  
As planned, protocol-defined interim reviews of safety and PK data were completed for the participants 
in each age cohort to assess the suitability of the proposed initial doses. Dose modifications that were 
made based on the outcome of PK modelling and assessment of observed safety data as a result of the 
interim reviews are summarized below (Table 3.) 
EMA/265651/2021  
Page 8/15 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3. 
A total of 51 participants were screened, 47 were allocated, and 46 received study medication (a single 
dose of IV IMI/REL). All 46 participants who received IMI/REL completed the study as per the protocol. 
42 of the 46 treated participants were included in the popPK population for the PK analyses, and 4 
participants were excluded from the Per Protocol population due to protocol deviations with the dosing 
extended beyond the planned infusion duration.  
Population PK modeling leveraging sparse PK data per participant was performed to summarize PK 
parameters (Systemic clearance and V1) and PK exposures (AUC0-∞ and Cmax) for both imipenem and 
REL.  
NCA was performed for cilastatin. Because of the sparse PK sampling schedule per participant, the λz 
NCA parameter was not calculated for the cilastatin analyte. As a result, the NCA PK parameters 
depending on λz, were also not calculated (including AUC0-∞, CL, and V1) for cilastatin.  
Summary statistics of imipenem, REL and cilastatin PK parameters in Cohorts 1 through 5 are 
presented in Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6, respectively. Note that in the tables the initial dose in all 
cohorts are listed however the MAH states that the summary of cohort-specific PK parameters is 
described by actual dose administered and infusion duration.

Efficacy results 
Study P020 was a single-dose PK and safety study and clinical efficacy was not evaluated. 
Safety results 
Safety analyses were based on the safety population, which included all 46 allocated participants who 
received infusion of study medication. 
Table 7. Extent of Exposure – Safety Population 
Source: CLINICAL STUDY REPORT P020MK7655A Table 10-6. 
Safety results are summarized overall and then separately for different age group cohorts in the 
submitted report, as significant physiological differences exist for paediatric patients of different age 
groups (eg, older age Cohorts 1-3 [2 to <18 years] vs those enrolled in younger age Cohorts 4-5 [<2 
years]). 
Overall, for Cohorts 1-5, 8 participants (17.4%) experienced at least 1 AE and 2 participants (4.3%) 
had AEs categorized as drug-related by the investigator. All reported AEs occurred in the post-
treatment period, most were mild in severity, none were SAEs or fatal events, and none led to infusion 
interruption/discontinuation or study discontinuation. Overall, for Cohorts 1-5, the most frequently 
reported AEs were anaemia (6.5%), and diarrhoea (6.5%). Drug-related AEs reported in the study 
were increased ALT, increased AST, anaemia, and diarrhoea.  
Elevations in liver transaminases meeting pre-defined criteria were categorized as Adverse Events of 
Special Interest. No events meeting these criteria were documented. 
Thirty-eight participants (3 in Cohort 1, 5 in Cohort 2, 6 in Cohort 3, 8 in Cohort 4 and 16 in Cohort 5) 
had at least one laboratory value at post-treatment Visit 3 that met DMID or DAIDS toxicity (for 
EMA/265651/2021  
Page 11/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
calcium results) grades of 1-4 (majority were Grade 1 or 2). No clinically meaningful changes in 
chemistry and haematology mean values or vital signs were observed in any of the cohorts from 
Baseline to Visit 3. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Relebactam (REL) is a non-β-lactam BLI of the diazobicyclooctane family and an inhibitor of Ambler 
class A and class C β-lactamases. REL restores the activity of imipenem in carbapenem-resistant gram-
negative bacterial infections. REL has been developed for administration as an FDC with imipenem and 
cilastatin in a single vial, for IV administration (IMI/REL). 
IMI/REL was initially approved in the EU in February 2020 for the treatment of infections due to 
aerobic gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. Subsequently, in November 
2020, IMI/REL was approved by the European Commission for the additional indication for treatment of 
HAP, including VAP, in adults and bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be 
associated with HAP or VAP, in adults. 
Study P020 was conducted in accordance with guidance from the EMA-CHMP and US FDA and is part of 
the PIP approved by the EMA (PIP EMEA-001809-PIP01-15-M02). The information from this Phase 1b 
study will be used to determine appropriate dosing regimens for a Phase 2/3 efficacy study of IMI/REL 
in the paediatric population (Study P021). A variation applicant comprising data to support the 
efficacy, safety, and PK of IMI/REL to treat paediatric patients with HAP, including VAP, and 
bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be associated with HAP or VAP, and 
infections due to aerobic gram-negative organisms with limited treatment options, is expected by end 
of 2023. 
P020 was an open-label, noncomparative Phase 1b study of a single IV dose of IMI/REL in male and 
female paediatric participants receiving standard-of-care antibacterial therapy for treatment of a 
confirmed or suspected gram-negative bacterial infection. Study P020 was a single-dose PK and safety 
study and clinical efficacy was not evaluated. 
Interim PK analysis resulted in modified doses for Cohort 1 (12 to <18), 4 (3 months to <2 years) and 
5 (birth to <3 months) (Table 3). 
In general, treatment with a single dose of IMI/REL was generally well tolerated and AEs occurred with 
low frequency. Eight participants (17.4%) experienced at least 1 AE in the study, of which 2 
participants (4.3%) experienced mild AEs categorized as drug-related by the investigator (increased 
ALT, increased AST, anaemia in 1 participant; diarrhoea in 1 participant). All AEs were reported in the 
post-treatment period and therefore did not result in infusion interruption/discontinuation or study 
discontinuation. No SAEs or deaths were reported during the study. These results are in keeping with 
the known safety profile of IMI/REL in adults and the underlying clinical condition being treated. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of this study indicate that a single dose of IMI/REL IV infusion was generally well tolerated 
in paediatric participants (from birth to less than 18 years of age). No safety concerns were observed 
during the study.  
The results of this study do not impact or alter the overall benefit/risk balance of IMI/REL in the 
currently authorised indications and populations and do not warrant any changes to the terms of 
marketing authorisation or updates to the Product Information at this time.

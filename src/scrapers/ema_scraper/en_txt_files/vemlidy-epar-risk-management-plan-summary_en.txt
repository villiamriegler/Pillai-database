PART I: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR VEMLIDY (TENOFOVIR 
ALAFENAMIDE) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Vemlidy. The RMP details important 
risks of Vemlidy, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Vemlidy’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Vemlidy’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vemlidy should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Vemlidy should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Vemlidy’s 
RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What is it Used for 
Vemlidy is authorized for treating chronic hepatitis B (CHB), an infectious disease that affects 
the liver, in patients aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg. It contains tenofovir 
alafenamide (TAF) as the active substance and it is given orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of Vemlidy’s benefits can be found in Vemlidy’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vemlidy  
II. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of Vemlidy, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Vemlidy’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimizes its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vemlidy is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks are those that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Vemlidy. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the 
long-term use of the medicine);

II.B. 
Summary of Important Risks 
Vemlidy has been assigned the legal status of a medicine subject to medical prescription in the 
European Union (EU), whereby Vemlidy therapy should be initiated by a doctor experienced in 
the management of chronic hepatitis B (as described in section 4.2 of the SmPC).

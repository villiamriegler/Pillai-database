CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Fulvestrant is indicated: 
• 
as monotherapy for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women:  
- 
- 
not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or 
with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression 
on antiestrogen therapy. 
• 
in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see section 5.1). 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the combination treatment with palbociclib should be combined 
with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adult females (including elderly) 
The recommended dose is 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an additional 500 mg dose given 
two weeks after the initial dose. 
When fulvestrant is used in combination with palbociclib, please also refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of palbociclib. 
Prior to the start of treatment with the combination of fulvestrant plus palbociclib, and throughout 
its duration, pre/perimenopausal women should be treated with LHRH agonists according to local 
clinical practice. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min). Safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in patients with 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min), and, therefore, caution is 
recommended in these patients (see section 4.4).

Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. 
However, as fulvestrant exposure may be increased, fulvestrant should be used with caution in 
these patients. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 
and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of fulvestrant in children from birth to 18 years of age have not been 
established. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made. 
Method of administration  
Fulvestrant Mylan should be administered as two consecutive 5 ml injections by slow intramuscular 
injection (1-2 minutes/injection), one in each buttock (gluteal area). 
Caution should be taken if injecting Fulvestrant Mylan at the dorsogluteal site due to the proximity 
of the underlying sciatic nerve. 
For detailed instructions for administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). 
Severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Fulvestrant should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). 
Fulvestrant should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance 
less than 30 ml/min). 
Due to the intramuscular route of administration, fulvestrant should be used with caution if treating 
patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment. 
Thromboembolic events are commonly observed in women with advanced breast cancer and have 
been observed in clinical studies with fulvestrant (see section 4.8). This should be taken into 
consideration when prescribing fulvestrant to patients at risk. 
Injection site related events including sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral 
neuropathy have been reported with fulvestrant injection. Caution should be taken while 
administering fulvestrant at the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying 
sciatic nerve (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
There are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. Due to the mechanism of action 
of fulvestrant, there is a potential risk of osteoporosis. 
The efficacy and safety of fulvestrant (either as monotherapy or in combination with palbociclib) 
have not been studied in patients with critical visceral disease. 
When fulvestrant is combined with palbociclib, please also refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of palbociclib. 
Interference with estradiol antibody assays  
Due to the structural similarity of fulvestrant and estradiol, fulvestrant may interfere with antibody 
based-estradiol assays and may result in falsely increased levels of estradiol. 
Paediatric population 
Fulvestrant is not recommended for use in children and adolescents as safety and efficacy have not 
been established in this group of patients (see section 5.1).

Fulvestrant Mylan contains 10% w/v alcohol (ethanol) 
This medicinal product contains 500 mg alcohol (ethanol) in each 5 ml which is equivalent to 10% 
w/v. The amount in one treatment dose (i.e. two syringes) of this medicinal product is equivalent 
to less than 25 ml beer or 10 ml wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicinal product will 
not have any noticeable effects. 
Fulvestrant Mylan contains benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains 500 mg benzyl alcohol in each 5 ml which is equivalent to 100 
mg/ml (10% w/v). Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. 
Fulvestrant Mylan contains benzyl benzoate 
This medicinal product contains 750 mg benzyl benzoate in each 5 ml which is equivalent to 150 
mg/ml (15% w/v).  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
A clinical interaction study with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4) demonstrated that fulvestrant 
does not inhibit CYP3A4. Clinical interaction studies with rifampicin (inducer of CYP3A4) and 
ketoconazole (inhibitor of CYP3A4) showed no clinically relevant change in fulvestrant clearance. 
Dose adjustment is therefore not necessary in patients who are receiving fulvestrant and CYP3A4 
inhibitors or inducers concomitantly. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Patients of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with 
Fulvestrant Mylan and for 2 years after the last dose. 
Pregnancy 
Fulvestrant is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). Fulvestrant has been shown to cross 
the 
placenta after single intramuscular doses in rat and rabbit. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive 
toxicity including an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities and deaths (see section 5.3). If 
pregnancy occurs while taking fulvestrant, the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to 
the 
foetus and potential risk for loss of pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with fulvestrant. Fulvestrant is excreted in 
milk in lactating rats. It is not known whether fulvestrant is excreted in human milk. Considering 
the potential for serious adverse reactions due to fulvestrant in breast-fed infants, use during 
lactation is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
The effects of fulvestrant on fertility in humans has not been studied. 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Fulvestrant has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, since 
asthenia has been reported very commonly with fulvestrant, caution should be observed by those 
patients who experience this adverse reaction when driving or operating machinery.

Monotherapy 
This section provides information based on all adverse reactions from clinical studies, post-
marketing studies or spontaneous reports. In the pooled dataset of fulvestrant monotherapy, the 
most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions, asthenia, nausea, and 
increased hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP). 
In table 1, the following frequency categories for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were calculated 
based on the fulvestrant 500 mg treatment group in pooled safety analyses of studies that 
compared fulvestrant 500 mg with fulvestrant 250 mg [CONFIRM (Study D6997C00002), FINDER 1 
(Study D6997C00004), FINDER 2 (Study D6997C00006), and NEWEST (Study D6997C00003) 
studies], or from FALCON (Study D699BC00001) alone that compared fulvestrant 500 mg with 
anastrozole 1 mg. Where frequencies differ between the pooled safety analysis and FALCON, the 
highest frequency is presented. The frequencies in Table 1 were based on all reported adverse drug 
reactions, regardless of the investigator assessment of causality. The median duration of 
fulvestrant 500 mg treatment across the pooled dataset (including the studies mentioned above 
plus FALCON) was 6.5 months. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and System Organ Class 
(SOC). 
Frequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥1/10), 
Common (≥1/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100). Within each frequency grouping 
adverse reactions are reported in order of decreasing seriousness.

Includes adverse drug reactions for which the exact contribution of fulvestrant 
cannot be assessed due to the underlying disease. 
The term injection site reactions does not include the terms injection site 
haemorrhage, injection site haematoma, sciatica, neuralgia and neuropathy 
peripheral. 
The event was not observed in major clinical studies (CONFIRM, FINDER 1, FINDER 
2, NEWEST). 
The frequency has been calculated using the upper limit of the 95% confidence 
interval for the point estimate. This is calculated as 3/560 (where 560 is the 
number of patients in the major clinical studies), which equates to a frequency 
category of ‘uncommon’. 
Includes: arthralgia, and less frequently musculoskeletal pain, myalgia and pain in extremity. 
Frequency category differs between pooled safety dataset and FALCON. 
ADR was not observed in FALCON. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
The descriptions included below are based on the safety analysis set of 228 patients who received 
at least one (1) dose of fulvestrant and 232 patients who received at least one (1) dose of 
anastrozole, respectively in the Phase 3 FALCON study. 
Joint and musculoskeletal pain  
In the FALCON study, the number of patients who reported an adverse reaction of joint and 
musculoskeletal pain was 65 (31.2%) and 48 (24.1%) for fulvestrant and anastrozole arms, 
respectively. Of the 65 patients in the fulvestrant arm, 40% (26/65) of patients reported joint and 
musculoskeletal pain within the first month of treatment, and 66.2% (43/65) of patients within the 
first 3 months of treatment. No patients reported events that were CTCAE Grade ≥3 or that 
required a dose reduction, dose interruption, or discontinued treatment due to these adverse 
reactions. 
Combination therapy with palbociclib 
The overall safety profile of fulvestrant when used in combination with palbociclib is based on data 
from 517 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in the 
randomised PALOMA3 study (see section 5.1).  The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions of 
any grade reported in patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib were 
neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, anaemia, stomatitis, diarrhoea, 
thrombocytopenia and vomiting. The most common (≥2%) Grade ≥3 adverse reactions were 
neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, anaemia, AST increased, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue.  
Table 2 reports the adverse reactions from PALOMA3. 
Median duration of exposure to fulvestrant was 11.2 months in the fulvestrant + palbociclib arm 
and 4.8 months in the fulvestrant + placebo arm. Median duration of exposure to palbociclib in the 
fulvestrant + palbociclib arm was 10.8 months.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neutropenia 
In patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib in the PALOMA3 study, neutropenia 
of any grade was reported in 290 (84.1%) patients, with Grade 3 neutropenia being reported in 
200 (58.0%) patients, and Grade 4 neutropenia being reported in 40 (11.6%)  patients. In the 
fulvestrant + placebo arm (n=172), neutropenia of any grade was reported in 6 (3.5%) patients. 
There were no reports of Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in the fulvestrant + placebo arm. 
In patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib, the median time to first episode of 
any grade neutropenia was 15 days (range: 13-512 days) and the median duration of Grade ≥3 
neutropenia was 16 days. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 3 (0.9%) patients receiving 
fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
There are isolated reports of overdose with fulvestrant in humans. If overdose occurs, symptomatic 
supportive treatment is recommended. Animal studies suggest that no effects other than those 
related directly or indirectly to anti-estrogenic activity were evident with higher doses of fulvestrant 
(see section 5.3).  
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Endocrine therapy, anti-estrogens, ATC code: L02BA03 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Fulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist with an affinity comparable to 
estradiol. 
Fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) 
activity. 
The mechanism of action is associated with down-regulation of estrogen receptor protein levels. 
Clinical studies in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant 
significantly down-regulates ER protein in ER positive tumours compared with placebo. There was 
also a significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic 
estrogen agonist effects. It has also been shown that fulvestrant 500 mg downregulates ER and the 
proliferation marker Ki67, to a greater degree than fulvestrant 250 mg in breast tumours in 
postmenopausal neoadjuvant setting. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in advanced breast cancer 
Monotherapy 
A Phase 3 clinical study was completed in 736 postmenopausal women with advanced breast 
cancer who had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression following 
endocrine therapy for advanced disease. The study included 423 patients whose disease had 
recurred or progressed during anti-estrogen therapy (AE subgroup) and 313 patients whose 
disease had recurred or progressed during aromatase inhibitor therapy (AI subgroup). This study 
compared the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant 500 mg (n=362) with fulvestrant 250 mg (n=374). 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint; key secondary efficacy endpoints 
included objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR) and overall survival (OS). 
Efficacy results for the CONFIRM study are summarized in Table 3.

Nominal p-value with no adjustments made for multiplicity between the initial overall 
survival analyses at 50% maturity and the updated survival analyses at 75% maturity. 
ORR was assessed in patients who were evaluable for response at baseline (i.e. those 
with measurable disease at baseline: 240 patients in the fulvestrant 500 mg group and 
261 patients in the fulvestrant 250 mg group). 
Patients with a best objective response of complete response, partial response or stable 
disease ≥24 weeks. 
PFS:Progression-free survival; ORR:Objective response rate; OR:Objective response; 
CBR:Clinical benefit rate; CB:Clinical benefit; OS:Overall survival; K-M:Kaplan-Meier; 
CI:Confidence interval; AI:Aromatase inhibitor; AE:Anti-estrogen. 
A Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre study of fulvestrant 500 mg 
versus anastrozole 1 mg was conducted in postmenopausal women with ER-positive and/or PgR-
positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had not previously been treated with any 
hormonal therapy. A total of 462 patients were randomised 1:1 sequentially to receive either 
fulvestrant 500 mg or anastrozole 1 mg. Randomisation was stratified by disease setting (locally 
advanced or metastatic), prior chemotherapy for advanced disease, and measurable disease. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was investigator assessed progression-free survival 
(PFS) evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours). Key 
secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). 
Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 63 years (range 36-90). The majority of 
patients (87.0%) had metastatic disease at baseline. Fifty-five percent (55.0%) of patients had 
visceral metastasis at baseline. A total of 17.1% of patients received a prior chemotherapy regimen 
for advanced disease; 84.2% of patients had measurable disease. 
Consistent results were observed across the majority of pre-specified patient subgroups. For the 
subgroup of patients with disease limited to non-visceral metastasis (n=208), the HR was 0.592 
(95% CI: 0.419, 0.837) for the fulvestrant arm compared to the anastrozole arm. For the subgroup 
of patients with visceral metastasis (n=254), the HR was 0.993 (95% CI: 0.740, 1.331) for the 
fulvestrant arm compared to the anastrozole arm. The efficacy results of the FALCON study are 
presented in Table 4 and Figure 1.

Two phase-3 clinical studies were completed in a total of 851 postmenopausal women with 
advanced breast cancer who had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or 
progression following endocrine therapy for advanced disease. Seventy seven percent (77%) of the 
study population had estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. These studies compared the safety 
and efficacy of monthly administration of fulvestrant 250 mg versus the daily administration of 
1 mg anastrozole (aromatase inhibitor). Overall, fulvestrant at the 250 mg monthly dose was at 
least as effective as anastrozole in terms of progression free survival, objective response, and time 
to death. There were no statistically significant differences in any of these endpoints between the 
two treatment groups. Progression-free survival was the primary endpoint. Combined analysis of 
both studies showed that 83% of patients who received fulvestrant progressed, compared with 
85% of patients who received anastrozole. Combined analysis of both studies showed the hazard 
ratio of fulvestrant 250 mg to anastrozole for progression-free survival was  
0.95 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.10). The objective response rate for Fulvestrant 250 mg was 19.2% 
compared with 16.5% for anastrozole. The median time to death was 27.4 months for patients 
treated with fulvestrant and 27.6 months for patients treated with anastrozole. The hazard ratio of 
fulvestrant 250 mg to anastrozole for time to death was 1.01 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.19). 
Combination therapy with palbociclib 
A Phase 3, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study of fulvestrant 
500 mg plus palbociclib 125 mg versus fulvestrant 500 mg plus placebo was conducted in women 
with HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to resection or 
radiation therapy with curative intent or metastatic breast cancer, regardless of their menopausal 
status, whose disease progressed after prior endocrine therapy in the (neo) adjuvant or metastatic 
setting. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 521 pre/peri- and postmenopausal women who had progressed on or within 12 months 
from completion of adjuvant endocrine therapy on or within 1 month from prior endocrine therapy 
for advanced disease, were randomised 2:1 to fulvestrant plus palbociclib or fulvestrant plus 
placebo and stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, menopausal status at 
study entry (pre/peri- versus postmenopausal), and presence of visceral metastases. 
Pre/perimenopausal women received the LHRH agonist goserelin. Patients with 
advanced/metastatic, symptomatic, visceral spread, that were at risk of life-threatening 
complications in the short term (including patients with massive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, 
pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and over 50% liver involvement), were not 
eligible for enrolment into the study. 
Patients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic 
deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. 
Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed. 
Patients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the 
fulvestrant plus palbociclib arm and the fulvestrant plus placebo arm. The median age of patients 
enrolled in this study was 57 years (range 29, 88). In each treatment arm the majority of patients 
were  
White, had documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, and were postmenopausal. 
Approximately 20% of patients were pre/perimenopausal. All patients had received prior systemic 
therapy and most patients in each treatment arm had received a previous chemotherapy regimen 
for their primary diagnosis. More than half (62%) had an ECOG PS of 0, 60% had visceral 
metastases, and 60% had received more than 1 prior hormonal regimen for their primary 
diagnosis. 
The primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST 
1.1. Supportive PFS analyses were based on an Independent Central Radiology Review. Secondary 
endpoints included OR, CBR, overall survival (OS), safety, and time-to-deterioration (TTD) in pain 
endpoint. 
The study met its primary endpoint of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis 
conducted on 82% of the planned PFS events; the results crossed the pre-specified Haybittle-Peto 
efficacy boundary (α=0.00135), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a 
clinically meaningful treatment effect. A more mature update of efficacy data is reported in Table 5. 
After a median follow-up time of 45 months, the final OS analysis was performed based on 310 
events (60% of randomised patients). A 6.9-month difference in median OS in the palbociclib plus 
fulvestrant arm compared with the placebo plus fulvestrant arm was observed; this result was not 
statistically significant at the prespecified significance level of 0.0235 (1-sided). In the placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm, 15.5% of randomised patients received palbociclib and other CDK inhibitors as 
post-progression subsequent treatments. 
The results from the investigator-assessed PFS and final OS data from PALOMA3 study are 
presented in Table 5. The relevant Kaplan-Meier plots are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

A reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib arm was 
observed in all individual patient subgroups defined by stratification factors and baseline 
characteristics. This was evident for pre/perimenopausal women (HR of 0.46 [95% CI: 0.28, 0.75]) 
and postmenopausal women (HR of 0.52 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.66]) and patients with visceral site of

(HR of 0.48 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.71]). Benefit was also observed regardless of lines of prior therapy in 
the metastatic setting, whether 0 (HR of 0.59 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.93]), 1 (HR of 0.46 [95% CI: 0.32,

Patient-reported symptoms were assessed using the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and its Breast Cancer Module 
(EORTC QLQ-BR23). A total of 335 patients in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib arm and 166 patients 
in the fulvestrant plus placebo arm completed the questionnaire at baseline and at least 1 post-
baseline visit. 
Time-to-Deterioration was pre-specified as time between baseline and first occurrence of ≥10 
points increase from baseline in pain symptom scores. Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant resulted 
in a symptom benefit by significantly delaying Time-to-Deterioration in pain symptom compared 
with fulvestrant plus placebo (median 8.0 months versus 2.8 months; HR of 0.64 [95% CI: 0.49, 
0.85]; p<0.001). 
Effects on the postmenopausal endometrium 
Preclinical data do not suggest a stimulatory effect of fulvestrant on the postmenopausal 
endometrium (see section 5.3). A 2-week study in healthy postmenopausal volunteers treated with 
20 μg per day ethinylestradiol showed that pre-treatment with fulvestrant 250 mg resulted in 
significantly reduced stimulation of the postmenopausal endometrium, compared to pre-treatment 
with placebo, as judged by ultrasound measurement of endometrium thickness. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 weeks in breast cancer patients treated with either fulvestrant 
500 mg or fulvestrant 250 mg did not result in clinically significant changes in endometrial 
thickness, indicating a lack of agonist effect. There is no evidence of adverse endometrial effects in 
the breast cancer patients studied. No data are available regarding endometrial morphology.  
In two short-term studies (1 and 12 weeks) in premenopausal patients with benign gynaecologic 
disease, no significant differences in endometrial thickness were observed by ultrasound 
measurement between fulvestrant and placebo groups. 
Effects on bone 
There are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. Neoadjuvant treatment for up to 
16 weeks in breast cancer patients with either fulvestrant 500 mg or fulvestrant 250 mg did not 
result in clinically significant changes in serum bone-turnover markers. 
Paediatric population 
Fulvestrant is not indicated for use in children. The European Medicines Agency has waived the 
obligation to submit the results of studies with fulvestrant in all subsets of the paediatric population 
in breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
An open-label phase 2 study investigated the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant 
in  
30 girls aged 1 to 8 years with Progressive Precocious Puberty associated with McCune Albright 
Syndrome (MAS). The paediatric patients received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of 
fulvestrant. This 12-month study investigated a range of MAS endpoints and showed a reduction in 
the frequency of vaginal bleeding and a reduction in the rate of bone age advancement. The 
steady-state trough concentrations of fulvestrant in children in this study were consistent with that 
in adults (see section 5.2). There were no new safety concerns arising from this small study, but 5-
year data are yet not available. 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After administration of fulvestrant long-acting intramuscular injection, fulvestrant is slowly 
absorbed and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached after about 5 days. 
Administration of fulvestrant 500 mg regimen achieves exposure levels at, or close to, steady state 
within the first month of dosing (mean [CV]: AUC 475 [33.4%] ng.days/ml, Cmax 25.1 [35.3%] 
ng/ml, Cmin 
16.3 [25.9%] ng/ml, respectively). At steady state, fulvestrant plasma concentrations are 
maintained within a relatively narrow range with up to an approximately 3-fold difference between 
maximum and trough concentrations. After intramuscular administration, the exposure is 
approximately dose-proportional in the dose range 50 to 500 mg. 
Distribution 
Fulvestrant is subject to extensive and rapid distribution. The large apparent volume of distribution 
at steady state (Vdss) of approximately 3 to 5 l/kg suggests that distribution is largely 
extravascular. Fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins. Very low density lipoprotein 
(VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) fractions are the major 
binding components. No interaction studies were conducted on competitive protein binding. The 
role of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) has not been determined.  
Biotransformation 
The metabolism of fulvestrant has not been fully evaluated, but involves combinations of a number 
of possible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids. Identified 
metabolites (includes 17-ketone, sulphone, 3-sulphate, 3- and 17-glucuronide metabolites) are 
either less active or exhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in anti-estrogen models. Studies using 
human liver preparations and recombinant human enzymes indicate that CYP3A4 is the only P450 
isoenzyme involved in the oxidation of fulvestrant; however, non-P450 routes appear to be more 
predominant in vivo. In vitro data suggest that fulvestrant does not inhibit CYP450 isoenzymes. 
Elimination 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fulvestrant is eliminated mainly in metabolised form. The major route of excretion is via the 
faeces, with less than 1% being excreted in the urine. Fulvestrant has a high clearance, 
11±1.7 ml/min/kg,  
suggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio. The terminal half-life (t1/2) after intramuscular 
administration is governed by the absorption rate and was estimated to be 50 days.  
Special populations 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from phase 3 studies, no difference in 
fulvestrant’s pharmacokinetic profile was detected with regard to age (range 33 to 89 years), 
weight (40-127 kg) or race.  
Renal impairment 
Mild to moderate impairment of renal function did not influence the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant 
to any clinically relevant extent. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a single-dose clinical study conducted in 
women with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and B). A high dose of a 
shorter duration intramuscular injection formulation was used. There was up to about 2.5-fold 
increase in AUC in women with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. In patients 
administered fulvestrant, an increase in exposure of this magnitude is expected to be well 
tolerated. Women with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) were not evaluated. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a clinical study conducted in 30 girls 
with Progressive Precocious Puberty associated with McCune Albright Syndrome (see section 5.1). 
The paediatric patients were aged 1 to 8 years and received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose 
of fulvestrant. The geometric mean (standard deviation) steady state trough concentration (Cmin,ss) 
and AUCss was 4.2 (0.9) ng/mL and 3680 (1020) ng*hr/mL, respectively. Although the data 
collected were limited, the steady-state trough concentrations of fulvestrant in children appear to 
be consistent with those in adults. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
The acute toxicity of fulvestrant is low.  
Fulvestrant solution for injection and other formulations of fulvestrant were well tolerated in 
animal species used in multiple dose studies. Local reactions, including myositis and granulomata 
at the injection site were attributed to the vehicle but the severity of myositis in rabbits increased 
with fulvestrant, compared to the saline control. In toxicity studies with multiple intramuscular 
doses of fulvestrant in rats and dogs, the antiestrogenic activity of fulvestrant was responsible for 
most of the effects seen, particularly in the female reproductive system, but also in other organs 
sensitive to hormones in both sexes. Arteritis involving a range of different tissues was seen in 
some dogs after chronic (12 months) dosing. 
In dog studies following oral and intravenous administration, effects on the cardiovascular system 
(slight elevations of the S-T segment of the ECG [oral], and sinus arrest in one dog [intravenous]) 
were seen. These occurred at exposure levels higher than in patients (Cmax >15 times) and are 
likely to be of limited significance for human safety at the clinical dose. 
Fulvestrant showed no genotoxic potential. 
Fulvestrant showed effects upon reproduction and embryo/foetal development consistent with its 
anti-estrogenic activity, at doses similar to the clinical dose. In rats, a reversible reduction in 
female fertility and embryonic survival, dystocia and an increased incidence of foetal 
abnormalities including tarsal flexure were observed. Rabbits given fulvestrant failed to maintain 
pregnancy. Increases in placental weight and post-implantation loss of foetuses were seen. There 
was an increased incidence of foetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic 
girdle and 27 pre-sacral vertebrae). 
A two-year oncogenicity study in rats (intramuscular administration of fulvestrant) showed 
increased incidence of ovarian benign granulosa cell tumours in female rats at the high dose, 
10 mg/rat/15 days and an increased incidence of testicular Leydig cell tumours in males. In a 
two-year mouse oncogenicity study (daily oral administration) there was an increased incidence of 
ovarian sex cord stromal tumours (both benign and malignant) at doses of 150 and 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
500 mg/kg/day. At the no-effect level for these findings, systemic exposure levels (AUC) were, in 
rats, approximately 1.5–fold the expected human exposure levels in females and 0.8-fold in 
males, and in mice, approximately 0.8-fold the expected human exposure levels in both males 
and females. Induction of such tumours is consistent with pharmacology-related endocrine 
feedback alterations in gonadotropin levels caused by anti-estrogens in cycling animals. Therefore 
these findings are not considered to be relevant to the use of fulvestrant in postmenopausal 
women with advanced breast cancer. 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that fulvestrant may have potential to cause 
adverse effects to the aquatic environment (see section 6.6).

1.   What Fulvestrant Mylan is and what it is used for 
Fulvestrant Mylan contains the active substance fulvestrant, which belongs to the group of estrogen 
blockers. Estrogens, a type of female sex hormones, can in some cases be involved in the growth 
of breast cancer.  
Fulvestrant Mylan is used either:  
• 
alone, to treat postmenopausal women with a type of breast cancer called estrogen receptor 
positive breast cancer that is locally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body 
(metastatic), or 
in combination with palbociclib to treat women with a type of breast cancer called hormone 
receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, that is 
locally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Women who have not 
reached menopause will also be treated with a medicine called a luteinizing hormone 
releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. 
When fulvestrant is given in combination with palbociclib, it is important that you also read the 
package leaflet for palbociclib. If you have any questions about palbociclib, please ask your doctor.

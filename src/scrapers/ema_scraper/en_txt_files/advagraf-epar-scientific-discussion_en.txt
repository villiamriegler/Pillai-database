SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

Introduction 
Transplantation is the most appropriate therapy for several conditions of end-stage organ failure, such 
as  renal,  hepatic  or  cardiac  failure.  Hepatic  and  cardiac  transplantation  are  life-saving  measures  and 
are undertaken when conservative therapies have failed. The number of liver transplants performed in 
Europe  has  increased,  reaching  plateau  of  close  to  4000  liver  transplants  performed  annually.  Renal 
transplantation rescues patients from the fate of chronic dialysis and improves patient quality of life to 
near  normality.    Transplantation  has  become  a  very  successful  procedure  with  success  rates  greater 
than 90% at 1-year post-transplant, regardless of the kind of transplanted organ.  
In current clinical practice the oral formulations of available calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine and 
tacrolimus, are generally administered on a twice daily basis. Poor compliance has been shown to be 
one of the factors associated with late graft loss demonstrated a statistically significant association for 
adherence  to  medication  regimen  with  once  daily  dosing  versus  twice  daily  dosing  in  adult  kidney 
transplant recipients.  
Advagraf is a new oral formulation of tacrolimus with prolonged-release characteristics compared to 
the  currently  authorised  product  Prograf(t).  Because  the  later  product  is  nationally  authorised,  the 
invented name may vary depending on the country of authorisation. Advagraf is the first calcineurin 
inhibitor  formulated  to  enable  once  daily  dosing  and  it  is  expected  that  it  may  help  to  improve 
compliance with dosing and cause less interference with the daily life activities of the patient. 
The  active  substance,  tacrolimus,  belongs  to  the  pharmacological  class  of  calcineurin  inhibitors  and 
originally derives from the fungus streptomyces tsukubaensis: it has a macrolide structure.  
Tacrolimus  has  been  in  use  as  an  immunosuppressant  in  a  variety  of  organ  transplantation  settings 
since 1989; there is extensive existing therapeutic experience with the substance.   
The  proposed  indication  for  Advagraf  is  in  the  (1)  prophylaxis  of  transplant  rejection  (primary 
immunosuppression  and  maintenance  therapy)  in  adult  kidney  or  liver  allograft  recipients;  (2) 
conversion  from  Prograf(t)  capsules  taken  twice  daily  to  Advagraf  prolonged-release  capsules  taken 
once daily in adult allograft recipients; (3) treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with 
other immunosuppressive drugs in adult patients. The proposed dosage is based on starting dose that 
depends  on  type  of  indication  and  transplanted  organ  and  followed  by  therapeutic  drug  monitoring 
including measurement of through whole blood concentrations.

Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Advagraf  is  presented  as  prolonged-release  hard  capsules  containing  0.5,  1  or  5  mg  tacrolimus  as 
active substance. Tacrolimus has been formulated to achieve once daily dosing with identical capsule 
strengths to the immediate release Prograf(t) formulation, which requires twice daily dosage. 
The 0.5 mg strength is encapsulated in size 5 capsules with orange body and light yellow cap, the 1 
mg in size 4 capsules with orange body and white cap and the 5 mg in 0  size  capsules  with  orange 
body and greyish red cap.  
Advagraf  prolonged-release  capsules  are  packaged  a  transparent  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)-
polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) /aluminium blister wrapped in an aluminium pouch with a desiccant. 
0.5 mg capsules are provided in pack sizes of 30 and 50 capsules, 1 mg capsules are provided in pack 
sizes of 30, 50, 60 and 100 capsules and 5 mg in pack sizes of 30 and 50 capsules. 
Active Substance 
Tacrolimus is a product of fermentation of Streptomyces tsukubaensis, which is not yet subject of a 
pharmacopoeial  monograph,  Ph.Eur.  or  other  national  pharmacopoeia.  The  molecular  formula  is 
C44H69NO12 · H O and the Relative Molecular Mass is 822. 
Tacrolimus appears as white crystals or crystalline powder. Tacrolimus contains one water molecule 
as a water of crystallization, and does not intake or release any water under atmospheric conditions. 
Tacrolimus  drug  substance  is  practically  insoluble  in  water  and  in  hexane,  freely  soluble  in  ethanol 
and very soluble in methanol. The partition coefficient in n-octanol/water system is greater than 1000.

It  does  not  display  polymorphism  and  neither  any  solvates  have  been  observed.  In  the  solid  state 
tacrolimus exists as one conformer, cis-form. 
•  Manufacture 
Tacrolimus  is  obtained  by  fermentation  in  line  with  Ph.Eur.’s  General  Monograph  on  "Products  of 
Fermentation”. Since 1988, three methods have been developed and used, i.e. Process I and Methods I 
and II, in order to improve productivity. The clinical and stability batches were manufactured by the 
original manufacturing method, Process I, as well as by the current manufacturing method, method I. 
Commercial batches have been manufactured by the current method, method I. While Method I was 
used originally, Method II was introduced in response to the need for larger batch sizes (approx. 15 kg 
versus 58 kg).  
Batch  analyses  confirmed  that  and  the  impurity  profiles  and  physical  properties  of  tacrolimus  drug 
substance produced by Method II are equivalent to those of tacrolimus drug substance manufactured 
by Method I.  
The  manufacturing  route  is  divided  into  two  parts:  a)  Fermentation  process  and  b)  Extraction  and 
purification  process.  There  is  no  intermediate  compound  involved  in  the  manufacturing  process  of 
tacrolimus drug substance. 
a) Fermentation process: Apart from the original strain Streptomyces tsukubaensis No. 9993, variant 
or mutant strains have been also introduced to increase tacrolimus yield in fermentation broth. A spore 
suspension  of  the  microorganism  is  prepared  and  stored  in  liquid  nitrogen.  The  tacrolimus 
fermentation broth is produced by a 4-stage scale-up fermentation process. The fermentation process 
was  optimized  by  modification  of  medium  composition  and,  modified  cultivating  conditions  and  a 
larger fermentor (Method 2).  
b) Extraction and purification: The fermentation broth is extracted and filtered. Tacrolimus is purified 
by  chromatography  and  crystallized.  In  method  II,  the  introduction  of  new  adsorbents  for 
chromatography  and  new  devices  resulted  in  higher  efficiency  of  purification  and  reduced 
environmental  impact.  In  addition,  the  polar  crystallisation  solvent  system  of  Method  I  is  replaced 
with  non-polar  solvent  system  in  Method  II  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  crystallisation  process. 
However,  the  final  crystallisation  solvent  system  at  the  final  step  remains  unchanged  to  obtain  drug 
substance  of  the  same  physicochemical  properties  as  that  manufactured  by  Method  I.  After  final 
crystallisation, tacrolimus is dried and packaged.  
The  process  validation  results  of  both  fermentation  and  purification  process  for  both  methods  show 
that each production step is reproducible and well controlled within the pre-determined manufacturing 
acceptance  criteria.  The  impurity  profile  of  tacrolimus  obtained  at  each  purification  process  was 
evaluated.  The  results  of  analysis  demonstrate  that  the  purification  can  produce  highly  purified 
tacrolimus drug substance that meets all the specifications. 
•  Specification 
The  specifications  for  tacrolimus  manufactured  by  Method  I  and  II  are  identical  except  for  residual 
solvents.  The  specification  for  the  control  of  the  drug  substance  includes  tests  for  appearance, 
identification  (IR,  HPLC,  colour  reaction,  optical  rotation  (USP)),  heavy  metals  (USP),  residue  on 
ignition (USP), water (USP), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), bacterial endotoxins (USP), 
microbial  limit  test  (USP),  and  residual  solvents  (GC).  The  two  sets  of  solvents  from  the  different 
methods of synthesis (I and II) are assayed under slightly different GC conditions. 
Batch  results  from  14  commercial  batches  manufactured  by  Method  I  (1996-2000)  and  from  three 
batches manufactured by Method II have been reported. All results for all parameters are well within 
the set specification. Medicinal products with tacrolimus as drug substance have been on the market 
worldwide for more than 10 years and more than 230 batches have been produced so far. 
•  Stability 
Stability data on four production and three pilot scale batches manufactured by Method I have been 
submitted. The production batches were packaged into triple PE bags within an iron drum and were 
stored at 30°C for 36 months and 40°C/75% RH for 6 months. All results at both storage conditions 
met the specification during the testing period. No significant change of any test parameter compared 
with initial value was detected. In addition, the samples of pilot batches (Method I) were stored in an 
open petri dish at 30°C/75% RH for 3 months and exposed to light (1000 lux) for 50 days, without 
detecting any significant change of any test parameter.

Stability  data  for  three  production  batches  and  three  pilot  scale  batches  manufactured  by  Method  II 
have been submitted. The production batches were packaged into triple PE bags within an iron drum 
and  were  stored  at  25°C/60%  RH  (normal  conditions)  for  36  months  and  at  40°C/75%  RH 
(accelerated) for 6 months. The pilot batches were stored at normal conditions for 36 months and at 
accelerated for 6 months. All results at normal conditions over the whole period of 36 months met the 
specification.  Neither  new  impurities  nor  new  degradation  products  were  observed.  After  6  months 
storage  at  accelerated  conditions  no  significant  change  of  any  test  parameter  compared  with  initial 
values was detected either.   
Comparison of the stability data, obtained from tacrolimus manufactured by either Method showed no 
difference.  These  results  indicate  that  the  stability  of  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  both 
methods is equivalent and not dependent on the method of manufacture. 
Therefore,  the  proposed  re-test  period  is  justified  when  the  bulk  drug  substance  is  stored  in  the 
proposed packaging material and conditions. 
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
Advagraf capsules have been developed to provide once a day dosing with similar safety and efficacy 
profiles  to  the  current  twice  a  day  formulation  of  Prograf(t)  capsules.  Based  on  the  composition  of 
Prograf(t) capsules, a granule formulation has been developed to prolong the  drug  release  profile  of 
tacrolimus. 
Initial  investigations  led  to  two  possibilities,  i.e.  the  hypromellose  system,  which  modifies  the  drug 
release profile by forming a polymer gel layer, and the ethylcellulose diffusion matrix system, which 
modifies the release profile by controlling water penetration and thus drug release. The objective was 
to achieve 90% drug release at 6 to 12 hours.  
Two formulations that showed the best dissolution characteristics (Prototype 3 and 4) were promoted 
for further development. 
Hypromellose  is  known  to  increase  oral  absorption  in  the  GIT  of  poorly  soluble  drugs  so  it  was 
decided  a  small  amount  to  be  added  and  investigate  its  effect  on  the  drug  release  (Prototype  5). 
Formulations  with  hypromellose  displayed  better  overall  dissolution  characteristics,  and  therefore, 
hypromellose became part of the granule formulation. 
Five further prototype formulations were investigated with varying ethylscellulose, hypromellose and 
lactose  monohydrate  concentrations.  Formulations  designated  MR4  and  MR3  respectively  were 
selected for a single-dose biopharmaceutics study (99-0-060), while it had been demonstrated that the 
release profiles of these two formulations were not affected by the dissolution conditions. 
The  biopharmaceutics  study  showed  that  MR4  exhibits  similar  AUC  and  equal  or  reduced  Cmax 
compared  to  immediate  release  Prograf(t)  capsules,  thus  it  was  selected  for  further  development. 
Subsequently, the amount of lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate of the final blend for MR4 
prototype capsules was optimized for the three strengths 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 5 mg. The excipient drug 
substance  ratio  is  identical  for  all  three  capsule  strengths,  and  the  only  differences  being  the  filling 
amount  into  the  capsule  and  the  capsule  size.  One  batch  of  each  strength  was  prepared  and  used  in 
single  dose  bioequivalence  study  and  dissolution  comparisons.  The  dissolution  curves  of  the  three 
capsule  strengths  have  been  shown  to  be  very  similar.  The  same  quantitative  composition  has  been 
used for all clinical batches, stability batches and proposed commercial production batches.  
With  regard  to  the  drug  substance,  there  were  no  particle  size  considerations  as  it  is  dissolved  in 
ethanol during the manufacturing process.  However, the influence of kneading time and particle size 
distribution  of  intermediate  granules  on  the  dissolution  profile  was  investigated,  and  a  particle  size 
specification  has  been  established  for  the  intermediate  granules.  In  addition,  the  influence  of  drying 
temperature, thickness of the paste on the drying tray on dissolution characteristics, residual  solvent 
and  related  substances  levels  was  investigated.  Finally,  the  influence  of  the  rotating  speed  of  the 
blender  and  the  blending  time  on  content  uniformity  and  dissolution  profile  was  investigated  but 
neither of them was found to affect these parameters. 
All  excipients  are  well  established  and  commonly  used  excipients  in  the  manufacture  of  solid  oral 
dose  forms  and  are  described  in  pharmacopoeia.  The  compatibility  of  the  tacrolimus  with  the 
excipients has been studied and deemed established. 
The final dosage form is an oral capsule, which is formulated to achieve prolonged release in order to 
allow a once daily dosage.

•  Adventitious Agents 
Magnesium  stearate  is  of  plant  origin.  Lactose  monohydrate  and  gelatin  meet  current  TSE 
requirements. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  two  distinct  processes:  i)  granule  manufacture  by  wet 
granulation  and  ii)  capsule  filling.  Tacrolimus  is  granulated  with  dehydrated  ethanol,  ethylcellulose, 
hypromellose  and  lactose  monohydrate.  The  resulting  paste  undergoes  drying  and  sizing  to  produce 
intermediate granules. The granules are then mixed with lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate 
and that mixture is filled into capsules. Different capsule strengths are achieved by varying fill weight. 
Capsules are packed into the proposed commercial packs. Reprocessing operations are not employed. 
•  Product Specification 
The  specification  for  Advagraf  prolonged  release  capsules  includes  tests  for  appearance  of  capsules 
and  content  (visual),  identification  of  tacrolimus  (TLC,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  content  uniformity 
(Ph.Eur.),  dissolution  (Ph.Eur.,  USP),  related  substances  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  and 
microbial limits (USP). Since dissolution is an important control test for a prolonged release product, 
two separate methods are used and release is measured at two time points in each method. 
Data  are  presented  for  six  commercial  batches  of  all  three  strengths  manufactured  at  the  proposed 
manufacturing site in 2004 and 2005.  The batches utilised different batches of drug substance. All 18 
batches comply with set release specifications.   
The tests and limits of the specifications Advagraf capsules are appropriate to control the quality of 
the finished product for the intended purpose. 
•  Stability of the Product 
Stability data are reported for three production scale batches of each capsule strength for 24 months at 
25°C/60% RH (normal conditions) and 30°C/60% RH.  These are supplemented by data at 40°C/75% 
RH over 6 months.  Further data have been generated at 50°C/3 months, 25°C/80% RH/3 months and 
exposure to light (D65)/50 days. 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  identification,  related  substances,  content 
uniformity, dissolution, assay, microbial limits, and water and all the results after storage under normal 
conditions were well within the specifications limits.  
Data at 40°C/75% RH showed increased by-product levels after 6 months’ exposure. The dissolution 
pattern followed that exhibited at the normal conditions. 
Storage over 3 months at 50°C did increase by-product levels quite considerably, with some variable 
effects on dissolution. Exposure to light (D65) during 50 days showed no effect. 
Matrixing  design  has  been  applied  as  the  same  powder  mix  is  used  for  filling  all  three  capsule 
strengths, The design is in accordance with ICH Guideline “Q1D Bracketing and Matrixing Designs 
for  Stability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products”  has  been  applied  for  long  term, 
intermediate and accelerated conditions.  
Additional  results  from  primary  stability  studies  for  one  full  scale  batch  of  all  strengths  has  been 
stored at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/60% RH for up to 3 years and 40°C/75% RH for up to 6 months 
have been provided. These batches were used in Phase 3 clinical studies.  
No significant changes in all test items have been observed up to available storage periods. 
Furthermore,  stability  data  after  first  opening  of  the  aluminium  pouch  (In-use  Stability)  have  been 
provided establishing an acceptable in-use stability period as stated in the SPC.  
Finally,  the  stability  of  intermediate  granules  has  been  studied  at  25°C/60  %  RH,  30°C/60  %  RH, 
40°C/75  %RH  and  in  addition  at  50°C,  25°C/75  %  RH  (open  to  the  atmosphere)  and  under  light 
(D65). Data up to 27 months are available. The granules show adequate stability is maintained and the 
proposed granule stability period is considered established when granules are stored in the proposed 
packaging material. 
In  conclusion,  based  upon  the  overall  stability  data  presented,  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage 
conditions for the intermediate granules and the finished product as stated in the SPC are acceptable. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
4/35

The  quality  of  Advagraf  prolonged-release  hard  capsules  is  adequately  established.  In  general, 
sufficient  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to  development,  manufacture  and 
control of the drug substance and drug product has been presented. There are no major deviations from 
EU  and  ICH  requirements.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically  stable  for  the 
proposed shelf life.

Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
No  new  non-clinical  studies  were  presented  in  support  of  this  application.  The  submitted 
pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  studies  of  tacrolimus  have  been  fully  established 
during the development of Prograf/Prograft together with a non-clinical overview based on the expert 
report  that  had  been  submitted  during  nation  registration  procedures  for  Prograf/Prograft  in  Austria, 
Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the 
United  Kingdom  [Expert  Report  on  the  Pharmaco-Toxicological  Documentation,  1993].  The 
document has been updated by mainly published information becoming available during the time after 
submission of national dossiers.  Most of studies were conducted according to the GLP standards. 
Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
Tacrolimus  has  been  demonstrated  to  act  via  several  mechanisms  of  actions  with  the  central 
mechanism  for  its  immunosuppressive  action  being  the  inhibition  of  the  activated  serine  threonine 
phosphatase,  calcineurin,  in  T-lymphocytes.    In  particular,  tacrolimus  inhibits  the  formation  of 
cytotoxic  lymphocytes,  which  are  mainly  responsible  for  graft  rejection.  The  drug  suppresses  T-cell 
activation  and  T-helper-cell  dependent  B-cell  proliferation,  as  well  as  the  formation  of  lymphokines 
(such as interleukins-2, -3, and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor. 
The  pharmacodynamics  of  tacrolimus  have  been  extensively  characterised  within  the  literature  and 
various  models  of  organ  transplantation  as  well  as  being  clinically  well  established  and  used  world 
wide for the 10 years as an immunosuppressive agent. The new formulation is not expected to alter the 
pharamacodynamics of tacrolimus. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics and safety pharmacology 
Following a request from the Swedish Health Authority  a review of the  data  regarding  the  effect  of 
tacrolimus  on  QTc  interval  was  performed.  At  doses  (i.v.)  above  0.1  mg/kg,  QTc  prolongation  was 
consistently observed and based on the results of these studies it appears that tacrolimus does have the 
ability  to  affect  ventricular  repolarisation.  The  proposed  wording  of  the  Summary  of  product 
Characteristics (SPC) for section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) is considered to address this point. In addition, 
the  special  precautions  for  use  in  the  SPC  advocate  ECG  monitoring  on  a  routine  basis  during  the 
initial post-transplant period.  
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  new  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  submitted.  Pharmacodynamic  drug 
interactions  with  tacrolimus  are  known  and  have  been  documented  in  the  literature.    Tacrolimus  is 
extensively  metabolised  by  hepatic  and  intestinal  wall  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  3A  isoenzymes.  
Therefore, concomitant use of tacrolimus with drugs metabolized by this enzyme should be taken with 
caution.  
Pharmacokinetics 
5/35 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
No  new  pharmacokinetic  or  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  submitted  in  relation  to  the  new 
prolonged  release  formulation.  The  applicant  submitted  existing  pharmacokinetic  data  as  well  as 
published  literature  with  respect  to  Prograf/Prograft  in  support  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  new 
Prograft MR4.  
•  Absorption and Distribution 
Based on existing data presented, tacrolimus has been studied using various routes of administration 
(oral,  i.v.  and  i.m.)  in  a  number  of  species.  Absorption  is  found  to  occur  throughout  the  gastro-
intestinal tract, in particular in the jejunum and duodenum and is rapid but bioavailability was low and 
variable.  A  number  of  factors  are  considered  to  contribute  to  the  low  and  variable  bioavailability 
including  extensive  first  pass  metabolism,  p-glycoprotein  mediated  efflux  and  the  presence  of  food. 
Fasting is found to improve absorption and the development of a once daily dosing may improve the 
absorption profile, reduce the variability and be more convenient for patients.  
Distribution  studies  revealed  that  tacrolimus  is  highly  protein  bound  (>  98%)  and  is  strongly 
partitioned into red blood cells and is extensively distributed throughout the body. The major organs 
of distribution in the rat were found to be the adrenal gland, lung and heart which showed up to 29 
times the plasma concentration. Other organs of distribution included the liver and the kidney as well 
as  the  gastro-intestinal  tract.  These  were  also  observed  to  be  the  major  organs  of  distribution  in  the 
monkey. Tacrolimus was found to accumulate quickly over the first week with the increase becoming 
gradual by week three and with steady state being reached by week 4-5.  
• 
Metabolism and Excretion 
Elimination was found to be slow from various well perfused tissues such as the kidney, liver, spleen, 
lung  and  gastro-intestinal  tract.  Toxicities  have  been  associated  with  some  of  these  tissues  (kidney, 
nervous  system,  heart  and  lymphoid  organs).  These  tissues  have  been  associated  with  higher 
tacrolimus concentrations and/or long elimination times.  
When  tacrolimus  is  administered  intravenously  or  orally  it  is  extensively  metabolised  by 
hydroxylation  and  demethylation  to  at  least  nine  metabolites,  with  eight  metabolites  identified  and 
characterised.  Despite  differences  with  respect  to  the  rate  of  formation  of  the  metabolites  the 
metabolite profile of various species (including humans) appears qualitatively similar, with M-I (13-
the  major  metabolites  with  negligible 
O-demethylated 
immunosuppressive activity in vitro. Cytochrome P450 3A enzymes in the liver and small intestine are 
major enzymes responsible for tacrolimus phase I metabolism, with 3A2 being principally responsible 
in the rat, DPB-1 in the dog and 3A4 in humans and there was found to be no involvement of phase 
two enzymes.  
tacrolimus)  being 
identified  as 
The  amount  of  unchanged  tacrolimus  excreted  was  found  to  be  <2%,  with  biliary  secretion  and 
subsequent  faecal  excretion  (80-95%)  comprising  the  major  route  of  elimination.  No  changes  were 
observed  with  respect  to  excretion  following  repeated  administration.  Following  oral  dosing 
tacrolimus  was  found  in  milk,  at  similar  levels  to  those  observed  in  the  plasma  at  eight  hours  post-
administration.  Prograft  has  been  extensively  used  for  a  number  of  years  and  subsequently  the 
potential  pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions  have  been  extensively  reviewed  and  documented  in  the 
literature (Venkataramanan et al., 1995; Matsuda et al., 1996; Mignat, 1997; Christians  et  al.,  2002; 
van Gelder, 2002, Scott et al., 2003). 
Toxicology 
• 
Repeat dose toxicity 
No new repeat dose toxicity studies have been submitted in relation to the prolonged release form of 
Prograf. The toxicity of tacrolimus has been previously well established in relation to signs of general 
toxicity  as  well  as  the  identification  of  the  target  organs  of  toxicity  including  the  kidney,  pancreas, 
eyes, nervous system and the heart as well as lymphoid organs. Over the past decade of clinical use 
6/35

with  tacrolimus,  clinically  toxicity  has  been  associated  with  the  kidney,  pancreas/glycaemic  control, 
eye and heart in treated patients and appears consistent with the findings of the repeat-dose studies.  
•  Genotoxicity 
The  genotoxicity  of  tacrolimus  has  been  studied  in  vitro  with  respect  to  gene  mutation  in  bacteria 
(Ames  test),  in  vitro  Chromosomal  aberration  in  Chinese  hamster  lung  V79  cells,  in  vitro  HGPRT 
gene  mutation  test  in  Chinese  hamster  ovary  cells,  in  vitro  Unscheduled  DNA  synthesis  test  (UDS 
test) in rat hepatocyte cells, in vivo Micronucleus test in mice.  
The  studies  in  vitro  of  reverse  mutation  with  bacteria  showed  that  tacrolimus  even  at  the  highest 
concentration  (2000-5000  µg/plate)  did  not  inhibit  the  growth  of  any  bacterial  strains  (Salmonella 
typhimurium  TA  98,  100,  1535,  1537  cell  lines  and  Escherichia  coli  WP2  cell  line).  Under  the 
conditions of the test, tacrolimus did not induce gene mutation in any bacterial strains tested with or 
without  metabolic  activation  by  a  rat  liver  microsomal  fraction  (S9  mix).  Tacrolimus  also  did  not 
induce a concentration dependent increase in the frequency of 6-thioguanine resistant colonies, with or 
without metabolic activation by S9, and was, therefore, evaluated as negative in the in vitro HGPRT 
gene mutation test in Chinese hamster ovary cells. 
On  the  other  hand,  tacrolimus  inhibited  growth  of  the  V79  Chinese  hamster  lung  cells  at 
concentrations of 50 µg/ml or higher in the test without metabolic activation by S9, and the IC50 was 
about  70  µg/ml.  In  these  cells  tacrolimus  decreased  the  mitotic  index  dose-dependently  in  the  tests 
with and without metabolic activation by S9.  In cultured V79 Chinese hamster lung cells tacrolimus 
did not induce chromosomal aberrations. Moreover, it was negative in the in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA 
repair assay. 
The in vivo effects of tacrolimus on the chromosomes and the mitotic apparatus were investigated in 
the  bone  marrow  cells  of  mice  (Micronucleus  test).  This  test  was  negative  up  to  oral  doses  of  500 
mg/kg tacrolimus, the maximum feasible dose for gavage in mice. This dose is more than 1,000 times 
higher than the expected doses for clinical use. The number of polychromatic erythrocytes decreased 
in mice  dosed  with  125  and  500  mg/kg,  pointing  to  tacrolimus  induced  inhibition  of  erythropoiesis. 
Under  these  test  conditions,  tacrolimus  did  not  induce  chromosomal  damage  and/or  damage  to  the 
mitotic apparatus. 
In  conclusion,  the  results  of  these  experiments  indicate  that  tacrolimus  is  devoid  of  any  mutagenic 
property under the conditions of the test systems up to the limits of cytotoxicity. 
•  Carcinogenicity 
Despite  reaching  the  maximum  tolerated  dose,  oral  carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  associated  with 
any carcinogenicity findings.  However the performance of topical application studies resulted in the 
formation of lymphomas. These findings in the topical application studies were associated with high 
systemic  exposure  levels  of  tacrolimus.  The  development  of  lymphomas  was  considered  to  be 
treatment  related  and  associated  with  the  immunosuppressive  action  of  tacrolimus.  Immuno-
suppression  with  various  agents  and  the  development  of  malignancies  is  a  well-documented 
phenomenon and appears to be virus related. 
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
Exposure  to  high  doses  of  tacrolimus  resulted  in  poor  weight  gain,  reduced  mating  behaviour, 
prolonged  dietrus,  delayed  parturition,  increased  pre-  and  post-implantation  losses,  reduced  pup 
viability,  increased  F1  variations  and  malformations  (with  relatively  high  ventricular  septal  defect) 
There  was  no  effect  on  the  developmental  or  mating  parameters  of  those  pups  that  survived  to 
weaning.  The  maximum  non-toxic  dose  levels  were  considered  to  be  0.32  mg/kg/day  and  0.1 
mg/kg/day tacrolimus in rats and rabbits respectively. 
A negative effect of tacrolimus on male fertility in the form of reversible reduction of sperm counts 
and motility was observed in a rat study using subcutaneous administration of tacrolimus at doses of 1 
and  3  mg/kg/day.  This  was  further  supported  by  histopathological  changes  of  male  reproductive

organs,  which  were  noted  following  repeated  administration  of  tacrolimus  to  rats  (Hisatomi  et  al, 
1996). 
Despite the lack of experience with the administration of MR4 during pregnancy, the new prolonged 
release formulation would be considered to represent an equal risk. According to the adverse animal 
experience and as the safety of tacrolimus in human pregnancy has not been adequately established, it 
is recommended that MR4 should not be administered to pregnant women unless the perceived benefit 
justifies the potential risk to mother and foetus (see SPC, Section 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation). 
Furthermore, after systemic administration to lactating women or animals, tacrolimus is excreted into 
breast milk (Jain et al., 1997). Therefore, women should not breast-feed during treatment with 
tacrolimus. 
•  Local tolerance  
The  local  tolerance  of  tacrolimus  was  investigated  in  rabbits  using  peri-venous,  intra-arterial  and 
intramuscular  administration.  As  MR4  is  an  oral  formulation  of  tacrolimus,  these  studies  are  not 
relevant for the prolonged-release formulation. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment of MR4 oral formulation of tacrolimus followed primarily the draft 
of  guidelines  related  to  this  issue.  From  the  results  obtained,  it  is  concluded  that  MR4  is  of  no 
immediate risk to the environment and no proposals for labelling provisions are necessary to reduce 
any potential environmental risks. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology of an oral prolonged-release formulation of tacrolimus (Advagraf) is based on the 
pharmacological data which were obtained during development of its hard capsules and solution for 
infusion  which  as  Prograf/Prograft  has  been  approved  for  clinical  use  in  many  countries,  including 
most EEA states.  
The toxicity of tacrolimus both pre-clinical and clinical has previously been well established with the 
organs of toxicity identified. The proposed new formulation would not be considered to result in any 
new  toxicity  concerns.  The  alteration  in  the  release  profile  would  be  expected  to  improve  the 
variability  in  the  exposure  to  tacrolimus.    It  would  therefore  not  be  considered  to  alter  the  toxicity 
profile  and  may  potentially  improve  the  safety  of  tacrolimus  and  subsequently  the  lack  of  further 
studies with the new prolonged-release formula is considered acceptable.  
Animal data clearly indicate that systemic treatment with tacrolimus adversely affects male and female 
reproduction. With respect to reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity findings for Prograf, the new 
prolonged  release  formulation  (MR4)  would  be  considered  to  represent  an  equal  safety  concern  and 
the proposed wordings in the SPC are considered to adequately address these concerns. 
The use of Advagraf is not considered to pose a risk to the environment.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical Methods 
A  high  performance  liquid  chromatography/mass  spectrometry  (HPLC/MS)  assay  was  used  for  the 
characterisation of tacrolimus and its metabolites. The lower limit of quantification in whole blood is 
0.1 ng/mL, with linearity demonstrable to 30 ng/mL.  The inter-assay accuracy ranges from 90.2% to 
106.3% over the concentration range 0.1 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL. .  
For  therapeutic  drug  monitoring,  an  enzyme  multiplied  immunoassay  is  used  on  whole  blood  with 
spectrophotometric detection. The assay has a limit of detection of 1.2 ng/mL. 
General Methodology 
Conventional pharmacokinetic methods have been used and data analysis has been carried out using 
wel validated computer software. Clinical trial methodology for both healthy volunteer and transplant 
patients has been conventional and apparently carried out to high standards. 
It is noted that the clinical study programme was over reliant on white (Caucasian) male volunteers. A 
warning on the limited experience in non-Caucasian patients has been added to section 4.4 of the SPC.   
•  Pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers  
Single dose healthy volunteer studies  
Study 99-0-060 was a three-way crossover comparison of Prograf and two modified release  
formulations of tacrolimus - MR3 and MR4. It was conducted at a single US centre in August and 
September 1999. Twelve healthy male volunteers took single 5 mg doses (one capsule) of each 
formulation after a ten hour fast. There was a ten day washout period between treatments.  Blood 
levels of tacrolimus were measured over the subsequent 72 hours. All subjects completed the study. 
The derived pharmacokinetic indices for the immediate release and delayed release formulations are 
shown in Table 1.

The study in healthy volunteers indicates that  of  the  two  candidate  delayed  release  formulations  the 
exposure (AUC) following MR4 was slightly closer to Prograf than that of MR3. Consequently MR4 
went forward for development as the proposed market modified release formulation. 
Study  00-0-076  was  a  two-way  crossover  comparison  of  Prograf  and  modified  release  MR4 
formulations of tacrolimus. It was conducted at a single US centre in November and December 2000. 
Sixteen healthy male volunteers took a single dose of 1.5 mg (3 x 0.5 mg) of each formulation after a 
ten  hour  fast.  There  was  a  fourteen  day  washout  period  between  treatments.    Blood  levels  of 
tacrolimus  were  measured  over  the  subsequent  72  hours.  All  subjects  completed  the  study.  The 
derived pharmacokinetic indices are in Table 2.

Effects of food on drug levels 
Two single dose crossover studies in healthy male volunteers investigated the effects on food on the 
pharmacokinetics, principally absorption, of Prograf and MR4. 
Study 02-0-153 examined the relationship between the timing of a meal and subsequent blood levels 
of tacrolimus. Twenty three subjects completed the study which showed that in the presence of food 
there  was  an  increase  of  approximately  80%  in  time  to  maximum  plasma  concentration  and  a 
reduction of approximately 20% in maximum plasma concentration and a reduction of 26% in AUC in 
the presence of food. The length of fast before food, and the timing of the dose, whether immediately 
or one and a half hours after food did not appear to make an important difference.  
Study  01-0-123  was  a  prospective,  randomized,  open-label,  single  dose,  three-period,  six  sequence 
crossover  study  in  21  healthy  volunteers  to  determine  whether  a  high  fat  meal  affects  the  rate  and 
extent  of  tacrolimus  absorption  from  the  MR4  (modified  release)  formulation  relative  to  that  in  the

Multiple dose healthy volunteer studies 
The  summary  pharmacokinetic  data  from  two  healthy  male  volunteer  studies  are  shown  in  tabular 
form  below.  All  doses  were  administered  following  a  two  hour  fast.  The  studies  were  conducted  as 
single dose (Day 1) and multiple dose (Day 10) for ease of comparison only the multiple dose data are 
shown.   
Study  FG-506-04-21 was conducted at a single UK centre between September and December 2000. 
All doses were administered following a 2 hour fast.  Prograf (1 mg capsule) was administered twice 
daily  for  10  days.  MR4  (2  x  1  mg  capsules)  was  administered  once  daily  for  10  days.  A  washout 
interval  of  at  least  14  days  separated  the  two  treatment  periods.  Fourteen  out  of  sixteen  subjects 
completed both phases of the study.   
The elimination kinetics was similar for the two formulations, with a mean terminal elimination half-
life  of  approximately  41  h  for  both  MR-4  and  Prograf.    Based  upon  AUC(0-24  h),  there  was 
approximately  a  2  and  2.5-fold  accumulation  of  tacrolimus  in  the  blood  following  10  days  multiple 
dosing with Prograf and MR-4, respectively.  On Day 1, systemic exposure to tacrolimus, as assessed 
by  AUC(0-24  h),  was  similar  for  the  two  formulations.  Upon  attainment  of  steady  state,  once  daily 
dosing with 2 mg MR-4  resulted  in  an  18%  increase  in  24  h  systemic  exposure  of  tacrolimus  when 
compared to twice daily dosing with 1 mg Prograf

Study FG-506-04-25 was conducted at a single UK centre between April and August 2001. All doses 
were  administered  following  a  2  hour  fast.  Prograf  (2  x  2  mg  capsules)  was  administered  twelve 
hourly for 10 days. MR4 (4 x 1 mg capsules) was administered once daily for 10 days (a dose similar 
to the average dose used in long term maintenance immunosuppression). A washout interval of at least 
14 days separated the two treatments. Twenty-four out of twenty-five subjects completed both phases 
of the study.  
Based upon both AUC0-24 and Cmax, there was an approximate 2-fold accumulation of tacrolimus in 
the  blood  following  10  days  multiple  dosing  with  MR-4  and  Prograf.  Following  morning 
administration,  the  rate  of  absorption  of  tacrolimus  was  rapid  for  both  formulations,  with  a  median 
tmax of approximately 1 and 2 h being obtained for the Prograf and MR-4 formulations, respectively. 
Following the evening dose of Prograf, the rate and extent of absorption of tacrolimus was reduced, 
11/35

with  total  systemic  exposure  as  assessed  from  AUC(0-∞)  and  Cmax  being  17  and  50%  lower, 
respectively, following the evening dose compared to the morning dose when at steady-state. 
For both MR-4 and Prograf, Cmin(24 h) and AUC(0- 24 h) were highly correlated. This correlation 
was numerically slightly higher for the MR-4 formulation, but was statistically not different for both 
formulations.    The  elimination  kinetics  were  similar  for  the  two  formulations,  with  a  mean  terminal 
elimination half-life of approximately 38 h for both MR-4 and Prograf.

Tacrolimus  binds  strongly  to  erythrocytes  with  a  distribution  ratio  of  whole  blood:plasma  of 
approximately 20:1. In plasma the drug is highly protein bound (>98.8%).  Tacrolimus is extensively 
distributed  in  the  body  with  a  steady  state  volume  of  distribution  (Vss),  estimated  from  plasma  at 
1300 L.   
•  Elimination 
Tacrolimus  is  cleared  by  hepatic  metabolism,  principally  via  cytochrome  P450 3A4  isoenzyme 
(CYP3A4).  Orally administered tacrolimus is also metabolised by the gut wall, most likely by gastro-
intestinal  CYP3A4.    Possible  metabolic  phase  I  reactions  of  tacrolimus  appear  to  include 
mono-demethylation, di-demethylation, hydroxylation, and a combination of mono-demethylation and 
hydroxylation.  The  only  pharmacologically  active  metabolite  is  the  31-O-demethylated  metabolite 
which has immunosuppressive potency approximately equal to that of the parent compound. 
The average total body clearance of tacrolimus in adults is approximately 2.25 L/h in healthy subjects, 
6.7 L/h  in  kidney  transplant  patients,  4.05 L/h  in  liver  transplant  patients  and  3.9 L/h  in  heart 
transplant patients.  The elimination half-life (t½) of tacrolimus in healthy subjects was approximately 
43 hours.  
Following  i.v.  and  oral  administration  of  14C-labelled  tacrolimus,  most  of  the  radioactivity  was 
eliminated in the faeces, while less than 2% was eliminated in the urine.   
•  Pharmacokinetics in target populations 
Pharmacokinetic Studies with MR4 in de novo Kidney and Liver Transplant Recipients 
Two Phase II studies were performed to compare the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus following once 
daily  administration  of  MR4  (in  the  morning)  and  twice  daily  administration  of  Prograf  in  de  novo 
kidney (study FG-506E-12-01) and liver (study FG-506-11-01) transplant recipients.  
Comparisons of systemic exposure (AUC0-24), Cmax and trough levels (C24) were performed following 
the  first  dose  and  under  steady  state  conditions  (Day  14  and  Week  6  post-transplantation).  Both 
studies were of 6-week duration, at the end of which patients randomised to MR4 treatment arm had 
the  option  to  continue  into  Phase  III  follow  up  study.  Brief  details  of  these  studies  are  provided  in 
Table 7 and 8.

recipients. 
Following kidney transplantation patients received 
tacrolimus as either MR4 or Prograf for a period of 
6 weeks. 
The first total daily dose for MR4 and Prograf was 
comparable; however, the systemic exposure to 
tacrolimus on Day 1 was approximately 32% lower 
for MR4 than for Prograf. By Day 14 and Week 6, 
the systemic exposure to tacrolimus for MR4 was 
within 10% of that for Prograf. When normalised to 
an equivalent dose for both formulations (0.1 
mg/kg/day), the geometric mean AUC0-24 ratio of 
MR4:Prograf was 98% and 82% on Day 14 and at 
Week 6, respectively.

There was good correlation of AUC0-24 and trough levels in both studies. In Study FG-506E-12-01 
correlation coefficients were 0.83 and 0.94 for MR4 and Prograf, respectively; in Study FG-506-11-
01, correlation coefficients were 0.92 and 0.83 for MR4 and Prograf, respectively. Moreover, the slope 
of the line of best fit was similar for both formulations in both studies, indicating that for therapeutic 
drug monitoring, the same target trough level range can be targeted for both formulations. 
In  both  studies,  the  lower  systemic  exposure  to  tacrolimus  observed  for  MR4  on  Day  1  can  be 
attributed  to  an  absence  of  diurnal  effect  on  the  absorption  of  tacrolimus  for  Prograf  formulation 
administered in the evening relative to the morning on the first day post-transplant.

However,  despite  the  32%  lower  (kidney)  and  50%  lower  (liver)  exposure  to  tacrolimus  on  Day  1 
observed for MR4 compared to Prograf, the efficacy and safety of MR4 did not appear to be different 
to that of Prograf.  The finding of lower blood drug levels is clearly indicated in the SPC (section 4.2 
Posology and method of administration). Careful and frequent monitoring of tacrolimus trough levels 
is  recommended  in  the  first  two  weeks  post-transplant  with  Advagraf  to  ensure  adequate  drug 
exposure in the immediate post-transplant period. 
Pharmacokinetic Studies in Stable Kidney, Liver and Heart Transplant Recipients Converted from 
Twice Daily Prograf to Once Daily MR4 
The  applicant  has  carried  out  a  series  of  studies  in  which  adult  patients  with  stable  organ 
transplantation of at least six months were switched on an equal dose basis from Prograf to MR4. One 
study was conducted in children. Prograf and MR4 pharmacokinetics were evaluated at steady state, 
generally Prograf on study days 1 to 7 and MR4 from day 14 onwards. Prograf was given twice daily 
and  MR4  once  daily.    Dosages  were  to  be  kept  constant  other  than  in  a  situation  where  there  were 
clinical signs of toxicity or graft rejection.  
Study  02-0-131  is  a  Phase  II  one-way  conversion  from  Prograf  to  MR4  in  stable  kidney  transplant 
recipients.  The patient population for this study was fairly representative of the overall adult kidney 
transplant  population,  including  24/66  (36.4%)  female  patients,  12/66  (18.2%)  black  patients  and 
13/66  (19.7%)  diabetics.  This  population  profile  allowed  for  adequate  analysis  for  equivalence  of 
exposure  for  both  males  and  females,  among  patients  with  diabetes,  and  within  black  and  white 
populations. Patients were followed within the pharmacokinetic treatment period for at least 28 days 
post conversion to MR4 and provided data for two steady state pharmacokinetic profiles while patients 
were taking Prograf, and two steady state pharmacokinetic profiles while patients were taking MR4. 
The derived pharmacokinetic indices are shown in tabular form below.

The findings indicate that conversion to MR4 may offer benefits, including: equivalence of exposure 
with Prograf on a mg: mg basis that was consistent regardless of gender, race or diabetic status; less 
inter- and intra-subject variability in exposure when compared to Prograf; exposure highly correlated 
with  Cmin,  indicating  no  need  to  change  the  current  therapeutic  monitoring  system;  a  safety  profile 
equivalent  to  Prograf,  with  no  indication  of  over-  or  under-immunosuppression,  as  indicated  by 
laboratory  results  and  clinical  signs  and  symptoms,  through  4  weeks  after  converting  to  MR4;  and, 
lower Cmax with less variability in concentrations over time, which may prove beneficial in the long-
term. Kidney transplant recipients can be easily converted from a Prograf-based immunosuppression 
regimen to a MR4-based immunosuppression regimen on a 1:1 (mg: mg) total daily dose basis with 
minimal dose adjustments required after conversion. 
Study 02-0-152 is a Phase II four-period replicate design, conversion from Prograf to MR4 in stable 
liver  transplant  patients.    The  trial  had  an  8-week  PK  evaluation  period,  with  a  planned  2  to  3  year 
long-term extension period.  The patient population (pharmacokinetic evaluable set) for this study was 
fairly diversified in respect to gender (26/62, 41.9% female) and diabetics (11/62, 17.7% with PTDM 
at baseline; 12/62, 19.4% with diabetes mellitus type I or II prior to transplant).  The population was 
predominantly white (57/62, 91.9%).  The study provided data for two steady state pharmacokinetic 
profiles  while  patients  were  taking  Prograf,  and  two  steady  state  pharmacokinetic  profiles  while 
patients  were  taking  MR4.  Equivalence  of  exposure  between  Prograf  and  MR4  at  steady  state  was 
demonstrated. The 90% CI for ln(AUC0-24) was (85.42, 92.29), and was completely contained within 
the 80% to 125% limits. An analysis using dose-adjusted data confirmed the results.

Study  FG506-15-02  is  a  Phase  II  one-way  conversion  from  Prograf  to  MR4  5-week  PK  evaluation 
period (long-term follow-up for MR4 patients performed in Study FG-506-14-02).  All patients in the 
PK Evaluable Set remained on the same dose of tacrolimus throughout the study. The mean systemic 
exposure  to  tacrolimus  (AUC0-24)  following  the  administration  of  MR4  was  within  10%  of  unity 
when  compared  with  Prograf  in  stable  heart  transplant  patients.  The  AUC  was  within  the 
bioequivalence criteria based on the 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of treatment means and an 
acceptance interval of 80% to 125%. The trough levels of tacrolimus following MR4 administration 
were similar to those following Prograf administration, suggesting the same trough target therapeutic 
range for MR4 and Prograf. There was good correlation of trough to AUC for both formulations. 
This  study  has  shown  that  stable  heart  transplant  patients  can  be  safely  converted  from  Prograf  to 
MR4 on a 1:1 (mg:mg) basis. It should be noted that as the mean AUC ratio MR4: Prograf is 0.91, 
following  conversion  patients  may  need  to  be  monitored  to  ensure  maintenance  of  similar  systemic 
exposure.  
The derived pharmacokinetic indices are shown in tabular form below.

Study  03-0-160  is  a  Phase  II  one-way  conversion,  2  week  PK  evaluation  study  in  stable  paediatric 
liver  transplant  recipients  converted  from  a  Prograf-based  immunosuppressive  regimen  to  an  MR4-
based immunosuppressive regimen.  The sample size was relatively small (pharmacokinetic evaluable 
set  n  =  18)  but  was  fairly  diversified  in  terms  of  race  (61.1%  Caucasian;  38.9%  Black)  and  gender 
(72.2% female; 27.8% male).   
Equivalence of exposure between Prograf and MR4 at steady state was demonstrated. 
The 90% CI for ln(AUC0-24) was (90.8, 112.1) and entirely contained within the 80% to 125% limits. 
An  analysis  using  dose-adjusted  parameters  provided  similar  results.  There  was  a  strong  correlation 
between  AUC0-24  and  Cmin  (trough)  for  MR4  and  Prograf  at  steady  state,  with  the  correlation 
coefficient for MR4 on day 14 (0.90) being similar to that of Prograf on day 7 (0.94). Additionally, the 
CIs  for  ln(Cmin),  using  both  non-dose  adjusted  values  and  dose-adjusted  values,  were  entirely 
contained within the 80% to 125% limits when trough concentrations at steady state were considered. 
This indicates that trough values for MR4 and Prograf were equivalent at steady state.

There  was  good  correlation  of  AUC0-24  and  trough  levels  in  the  conversion  studies,  with  results 
indicating that the AUC 0-24 and C24 of tacrolimus for the MR4 formulation was equivalent to that 
for the standard formulation, Prograf, i.e the 90% CI lies within the acceptance interval of 0.8 – 1.25, 
with  the  exception  of  the  CI  for  C24  which  was  marginally  outside  the  acceptance  interval  in

Study FJ-506e-0002 was a three way crossover study designed to examine the dose proportionality of 
tacrolimus  following  single  doses  of  the  modified  release  formulation  in  healthy  male  Japanese 
subjects.  Subjects  received  single  1.5  mg,  4  mg,  10  mg  doses;  whole  blood  tacrolimus  levels  were 
measured  for  120  hours  following  each  dose  and  at  least  fourteen  days  were  allowed  for  treatment 
washout.  The  study  was  conducted  at  a  single  Japanese  centre  between  July  and  October  2004.  
Seventeen subjects completed the study. The derived pharmacokinetic indices for the modified release 
formulation are shown in Table 14.

Study  02-0-148  examined the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus following morning and evening 5 mg 
doses  (single  capsule)  of  Prograf  and  MR4  in  healthy  male  subjects.  Whole  blood  tacrolimus  levels 
were measured for 120 hours following each dose and ten to twenty days were allowed for treatment 
washout.  In  order  to  avoid  the  known  food  interaction  with  tacrolimus  morning  and  evening  doses 
were given at the mid-point of an eight hour fast.    The  study  was  conducted  at  a  single,  US,  centre 
between  February  and  April  2003.    Twenty-two  subjects  completed  the  study.  The  derived 
pharmacokinetic indices for the modified release formulation are shown in Table 15.

Although the diurnal reduction of approximately one-third following a single evening dose is likely to 
be  less  marked  following  multiple  dosing,  it  is  still  an  effect  comparable  in  magnitude  to  the  food 
interaction. Hence, SPC and PL provide reference to the time of dosing during the day.  
•  Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
No  new  data  have  been  generated.  The  SPC  indicates  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of  tacrolimus  are 
unaffected  by  renal  function  and  no  dose  adjustment  should  be  required.  It  also  warns  about  the 
nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus and advises monitoring of renal function. 
Impaired hepatic function 
No new data have been presented. Study 90-0-0020 (consisting of two reports dated 1996 and 1998) 
evaluated  the  pharmacokinetics  of  tacrolimus  in  patients  with  mild  and  severe  hepatic  dysfunction. 
The  reports  indicate  that  the  elimination  of  tacrolimus  is  prolonged  in  mild  hepatic  dysfunction  and 
markedly prolonged in severe hepatic  dysfunction.  It  is  concluded  that  in  the  case  of  severe  hepatic 
dysfunction whole blood, as distinct from plasma, monitoring is still valid. The SPC warns that a dose 
adjustment may be necessary in severe hepatic dysfunction. 
Race 
Study  FJ-506e-0001  was conducted in February and March 2003 at a single Japanese site.  Eligible 
subjects were healthy adult Japanese males. Subjects received a single 3 mg dose of tacrolimus MR4 
in  the  fasting  state,  whole  blood  drug  concentrations  were  measured  over  the  following  120  hours. 
Twenty subjects completed the study. Historical data from US single centre Study 00-0-077 were used 
to compare the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in Japanese and US Caucasian subjects.  
The  ratios  of  Japanese  to  Caucasians  for  the  geometric  means  of  Cmax,  and  AUC  were  1.406  and 
1.353, respectively, with 90% confidence intervals of 1.183 to 1.672 and 1.101 to 1.662.  On average 
the  Japanese  subjects  were  14  kg  lighter  than  the  American  subjects  and  when  adjusted  for  body 
weight the  ratios  of  Japanese  to  Caucasians  for  Cmax  and  AUC  were  1.147  and  1.103,  respectively 
with 90% confidence intervals of 0.975 to 1.349 and from 0.907 to 1.341, respectively.

No  new  data  have  been  provided.  The  proposed  SPC  indicates  that  a  dosage  adjustment  is  not 
necessary in the elderly. 
Children 
Study  03-0-160  was  conducted  from  January  to  June  2004  at  five  sites  in  the  US.  Eligible  patients 
were  to  be  no  more  than  twelve  years  old,  to  have  received  a  liver  transplant  at  least  six  months 
previously, and to be on a Prograf based immunosuppressive regimen with a stable total daily dose of 
no more than 20 mg. Patients with a rejection episode in the pervious 90 days were excluded. Enrolled 
patients continued to receive Prograf until the evening of day 7. On the morning of day 8 they were 
converted  to  MR4  on  an  equivalent  daily  dose  until  Day  14.  Twenty-four  hour  pharmacokinetic 
profiling was done on Day 7 and Day 14.  
Eighteen patients provided evaluable pharmacokinetic data; their median age was 9 years with an age 
range  of  5  -  13;  thirteen  were  female.  The  pharmacokinetic  results  are  presented  in  table  12  (see 
above). 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  new  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  the  new  formulation  (MR4).    However, 
interactions  between  tacrolimus  and  other  medicinal  products  have  been  thoroughly  investigated 
recently and the most relevant information has been added to the SPC, section 4.5. 
The  following  drugs  strongly  inhibit  CYP3A4  and  have  been  shown  to  increase  the  blood  levels  of 
tacrolimus:  ketoconazole;  fluconazole;  itraconazole;  voriconazole;  erythromycin;  and  HIV  protease 
inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir).  
The following drugs inhibit CYP3A4 and have been shown to increase the blood levels of tacrolimus 
requiring dose adjustment in some patients: clotrimazole; calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, 
nicardipine,  diltiazem,  verapamil;  clarithromycin;  josamycin;  danazol;  ethinylestradiol;  omeprazole; 
nefazodone.  
Grapefruit  juice  has  also  been  reported  to  increase  the  blood  level  of  tacrolimus  by  inhibiting  the 
activity of CYP3A4.  
The following drugs strongly induce CYP3A4 and have been shown to decrease the blood levels of 
tacrolimus  requiring  an  increased  dose  in  almost  all  patients:  rifampicin;  rifampin;  phenytoin;  St. 
Johns Wort (Hypericum  perforatum).  Phenobarbitone is also an inducer of CYP3A4 but to a lesser 
extent. 
Corticosteroids  are  inducers  of  CYP3A4  and  withdrawal  of  steroids  has  been  shown  to  increase 
tacrolimus blood levels.   Maintenance doses of corticosteroids may reduce tacrolimus blood levels by 
enzyme inhibition, thus increases or decreases in the dose of corticosteroids may decrease or increase 
tacrolimus  levels.  High  dose  prednisolone  or  methylprednisolone,  as  given  for  acute  rejection,  have 
the potential to increase or decrease tacrolimus blood levels.  
As  tacrolimus  may  reduce  the  clearance  of  steroid-based  contraceptive  agents  leading  to  increased 
hormone exposure, particular care should be exercised when deciding upon contraceptive measures. 
Enhanced  nephrotoxicity  has  been  observed  following  the  administration  of  amphotericin  B  and 
ibuprofen in conjunction with tacrolimus.  The half-life of ciclosporin is prolonged when tacrolimus is 
administered concomitantly, in addition, synergistic/additive nephrotoxic effects can occur.  For these 
reasons, the combined administration of ciclosporin and tacrolimus is not recommended.  
There is also potential for synergistic impairment of renal function or neurotoxicity when tacrolimus is 
co-administered  with  compounds  such  as  aminoglycosides,  gyrase 
inhibitors,  vancomycin, 
cotrimoxazole,  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs,  ganciclovir  or  aciclovir.    A  high  potassium

intake,  or  potassium-sparing  diuretics,  should  be  avoided  due  to  the  potential  for  inducing 
hyperkalaemia as tacrolimus can adversely influence potassium levels. 
Tacrolimus is extensively bound to plasma proteins (> 98.8%).  Concomitant administration of drugs 
which  are  also  highly  protein-bound  may  displace  tacrolimus  from  its  binding  proteins.    Thus, 
co-administration  of  drugs  such  as  oral  anticoagulants,  oral  anti-diabetics  and  non-steroidal  anti-
inflammatory drugs should be undertaken with caution. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The key pharmacodynamic action of tacrolimus is inhibition of cytokine gene transcription.  It enters 
T-lymphocytes by nonspecific mechanisms, and binds to a 12 kDa cis-trans rotamase, termed FK506 
binding  protein  (FKBP12),  in  the  cytoplasm.    The  tacrolimus-FKBP12  complex  binds  to  the 
phosphatase calcineurin, and thereby inhibits the dephosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated 
T-cells  (N-FAT)  preventing  translocation  of  N-FAT  into  the  nucleus  of  the  T-lymphocyte.    The 
inhibition  of  signal  transduction  pathways  prevents  transcription  of  a  set  of  lymphokine  genes,  in 
particular  those  encoding  interleukin  (IL)-1β,  IL-2,  IL-3,  IL-4,  IL-5,  IL-6,  IL-7,  granulocyte 
macrophage  colony  stimulating  factor,  tumour  necrosis  factor-α,  interferon-γ  and  the  gene  encoding 
the  IL-2  receptor.      Tacrolimus  suppresses  T-cell  activation,  and  the  subsequent  generation  of 
cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby down-regulating processes leading to acute graft rejection.  T-helper 
cell dependent B-cell proliferation is also affected. 
Clinical efficacy  
•  Dose response studies 
The applicant has not conducted any dose response studies. Dose requirements for tacrolimus are well 
understood from existing clinical experience with Prograf and apart from the immediate peri-operative 
period are determined on the basis of therapeutic drug monitoring.  
•  Main studies  
The development programme for MR4 encompassed one pivotal and two supportive studies. Primary 
evidence  of  the  efficacy  of  MR4  for  the  prophylaxis  of  organ  rejection  is  provided  by  the  large, 
comparative Phase III study of MR4, Prograf and ciclosporin in de novo kidney transplant recipients 
(02-0-158). Supportive efficacy data for MR4 are provided by Phase II pharmacokinetic studies in de 
novo kidney transplant recipients (FG-506E-12-01) and in de novo liver transplant recipients (FG-506-
11-01). 
Prophylaxis in liver transplantation 
Study  FG506-11-01  was  an  open  multicentre  comparison  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  tacrolimus  in 
adult (18 – 65 yrs) patients undergoing primary liver transplantation. The study was conducted at 21 
centres  in  Europe,  Canada  and  Australia.  Eligible  patients  were  randomised  1:1  to  a  Prograf  or  an 
MR4 based immunosuppressive regimen (129 liver transplant recipients with 62 patients randomised 
to  Prograf  and  67 patients  randomised  to  MR4).  Three  24-hour  whole  blood  concentration-time 
profiles  were  taken  during  the  study:  one  following  the  first  administration  of  tacrolimus,  and  two 
under steady state conditions at Day 14 and Week 6. The primary endpoint was the systemic exposure 
AUC0-24 of tacrolimus on Day 1, Day 14 and Week 6. 
The mean daily dose of MR4 increased from 0.118 mg/kg on Day 1 to 0.221 mg/kg on Day 14 and 
mean total daily doses of Prograf increased from 0.112 mg/kg on Day 1 to 0.176 mg/kg on Day 14.  
Trough blood levels in the early transplant period were higher for Prograf-treated patients than MR4-
treated patients; however, by Day 4 they were comparable.

As a secondary endpoint, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) was evaluated.  During the first 2 
weeks of the study, there were 11 cases of first biopsy-confirmed acute rejection in the Prograf group 
and there were 11 cases of first biopsy-confirmed acute rejection in the MR4 group.  Based on the Full 
Analysis Set, N=62 in the Prograf group and N=67 in the MR4 group, incidences of biopsy-confirmed 
acute rejection were 17.7% for the Prograf group and 16.4% for the MR4 group.  There were 13 cases 
of first biopsy-confirmed acute rejection beyond Week 2 of the study, 6 patients in the Prograf group 
and 7 patients in the MR4 group.   
During the first 2 weeks of the study, there were three graft losses in the Prograf group and there were 
two graft losses in the MR4 group.  There was one case of graft loss beyond Week 2 of the study in 
the Prograf group. 
The main efficacy outcomes from Study FG-506-11-01 for MR4 and Prograf are presented below.

Phase  II  study  FG-506E-12-01,  is  an  open  multicentre  comparison  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
tacrolimus in adult patients undergoing kidney transplantation. The study was conducted at 23 centres 
in  Europe  and  Australia.  Eligible  patients  were  randomised  1:1  to  a  Prograf  or  an  MR4  based 
immunosuppressive  regimen.  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  freedom  from  biopsy-confirmed  acute 
rejection  was  86.2%  and  83.1%  at  6  weeks  post-transplantation  in  the  MR4  and  Prograf  groups, 
respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimated graft survival rates at Week 6 were 98.3% and 93.1% for MR4 
and Prograf, respectively. There was no graft loss beyond Week 2 for the MR4-treated patients and no 
graft loss beyond Week 1 for the Prograf-treated patients. 
In  this  study,  patients  who  were  being  re-transplanted  were  eligible  for  inclusion;  however,  patients 
with  panel  reactive  antibody  (PRA)  grade  > 50%  or  with  a  history  of  a  former  graft  loss  due  to 
rejection within 1 year of transplantation were excluded.  Out of 129 patients in the Full Analysis Set, 
6 patients were undergoing re-transplantation and 15 patients had a PRA grade > 0%.  Details of acute 
rejection episodes and graft losses in patients undergoing re-transplantation or who had a PRA grade 
> 0% are presented in Table 18.

The subgroup of patients who were re-transplanted or who had positive PRA grades and who received 
MR4 (N=11) had 100% patient, graft and freedom from biopsy-confirmed acute rejection at 6 weeks 
post-transplant.  The subgroup of patients who were re-transplanted or had positive PRA grades and 
who received Prograf (N=7) had 100% patient and graft survival at 6 weeks post-transplant; freedom 
from biopsy-confirmed acute rejection was 71.4%. 
Study 02-0-158 was a one-year, multi-centre, Phase III, randomised (1:1:1), open-label, comparative 
(Prograf/ mycophenolate mofetil [MMF], MR4/MMF or Neoral/MMF), non-inferiority trial conducted 
in the USA, Canada and Brazil. 
METHODS 
Study Participants  
Adult  and  adolescent  patients  (at  least  12  years  old)  undergoing  first  or  repeat  renal  transplantation 
were eligible.  
The initial dose of randomized study drug (Prograf, MR4, or Neoral) was to be administered prior to 
or within 48 hours of the completion of the transplant procedure. Patients unable to take the first dose 
of study drug orally or via a nasogastric tube within 48 hours following completion of the transplant 
procedure were discontinued from the study. 
Treatments 
All patients were to receive MMF and corticosteroids concomitantly with the randomized study drug.  
Additionally, all patients were to receive induction therapy (basiliximab). All patients received two 20 
mg i.v. doses of basiliximab induction therapy and concomitant MMF and corticosteroids. Dosing of 
MMF was conducted according to the package insert [2003]. Prograf was initially administered as oral 
doses of 0.075 to 0.10 mg/kg twice daily. MR4 was initially administered as oral doses of 0.15 to 0.20 
mg/kg once daily as a single dose in the morning. Neoral was initially administered as oral doses of 4 
to 5 mg/kg twice daily. Doses of these immunosuppressants were adjusted based on clinical evidence 
of efficacy, occurrence of adverse events and whole blood trough concentrations. Target whole blood 
tacrolimus  concentrations  were  7  to  16  ng/ml  (Days  0  to  90)  and  5  to  15  ng/ml  thereafter.  Target 
whole blood ciclosporin concentrations were 125 to 400 ng/ml (Days 0 to 90) and 100 to 300 ng/ml 
thereafter.  
Patients were allowed to cross over to an alternative primary calcineurin inhibitor regimen (either the 
Prograf/MMF or Neoral/MMF treatment arms) to address an adverse event which led to randomized 
study drug discontinuation or in the case of severe or refractory rejection. Crossover to the MR4/MMF 
treatment arm was not permitted. 
All episodes of kidney dysfunction were to be evaluated for possible rejection after exclusion of other 
causes.  All  patients  were  to  have  biopsy  confirmation  of  rejection  episodes  before  treatment  for 
rejection was begun, or within 48 hours of initiation of treatment for acute rejection. The pathologist at 
the clinical site was responsible for grading all biopsies using the 1997 Banff criteria. Initial rejection 
episodes were to be treated with oral or intravenous corticosteroids with the dose not to exceed 1 g/day 
21/35 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for  a  maximum  of  3  to  5  days.  Subsequently,  corticosteroids  were  to  be  tapered  according  to 
institutional practice. If a patient had histologically-proven Banff Grade II or III rejection, the patient 
could  be  initiated  on  anti-lymphocyte  antibodies  (OKT3,  Thymoglobulin,  ATGAM)  as  per 
institutional protocol. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
(cid:190) 
Primary  endpoint 
was  the  1-year  graft  failure  rate  as  judged  by  the  composite  of  death,  graft 
failure (permanent return to dialysis or re-transplant), biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or loss to 
follow-up. 
(cid:190) 
Secondary endpoints:  
• 1-year patient and graft survival rates; 
• Incidence of BCAR (Banff Grade ≥ I) at 6 and 12 months; 
• Time to first acute rejection episode; 
• Incidence of anti-lymphocyte antibody therapy for treatment of rejection; 
• Severity of acute rejection; 
• Number of patients experiencing multiple rejection episodes; 
• Number of clinically treated acute rejection episodes; 
• Incidence of treatment failure (up to 12 months); 
• Incidence of crossover for treatment failure; and, 
• Evaluation of renal function. 
(cid:190) 
SAFETY concerns of special interests:
 bacterial, viral, and fungal infections  and  gastrointestinal 
disturbances  were  summarized.  Glucose  intolerance  was  summarized  for  the  at-risk  population 
(patients who did not present with diabetes mellitus at baseline). 
Sample size and statistical methods 
There were two data sets for analysis: 
• The full analysis set was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study 
drug. All safety and primary efficacy analyses were performed using this data set. 
• The per protocol set was defined as all randomized patients who had no major protocol violations or 
other events during the study that would make the patient inevaluable. 
The planned total number of patients was 660 in a 1:1:1 ratio. Estimates of the 1-year efficacy failure 
rate for Neoral / MMF (30%) and Prograf / MMF (25%) were used as the basis for the sample size. All 
assessments of non-inferiority were made using a margin of 10%.

Conduct of the study 
There  were  a  total  of  260  patients  who  were  screened  for  participation  in  the  study  but  were  not 
randomised to treatment.  For 76 patients, the reason for non-randomisation was ‘Selection criteria not 
met’, for 159 patients the reason for non-randomisation was ‘Other’, and for 25 patients the reason for 
non-randomisation was ‘Missing’.   
Altogether  668  randomised  and  638  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication.  Protocol 
deviations  were  observed  in  9  subjects  randomised  to  treatment:  three  patients  from  each  treatment 
group.  Overall  there  were  no  major  imbalances  as  regards  reported  deviations  comparing  treatment 
groups

MR4/MMF was statistically non-inferior to Neoral/MMF with regard to 1-year patient survival, graft 
survival  and  incidence  of  biopsy-confirmed  acute  rejection.  Prograf/MMF  was  statistically  non-
inferior  to  Neoral/MMF  with  regard  to  1-year  patient  survival  and  graft  survival,  and  statistically 
superior  to  Neoral/MMF  with  regard  to  the  1-year  incidence  of  biopsy-confirmed  acute  rejection. 
MR4/MMF was statistically non-inferior to Prograf/MMF with regard to 1-year incidence of biopsy-
confirmed acute rejection, with a treatment difference of 2.7% (95.2% CI: -2.7% to 8.2%) 
Kaplan-Meier estimates with data censored at the time of the last follow-up for patient survival, graft 
survival,  and  incidence  of  biopsy-confirmed  acute  rejection  provided  comparative  results  consistent 
with those obtained considering lost to follow-up as a failure. 
Patients  in  the  MR4/MMF  group  had  significantly  (p<0.05;  two-way  ANOVA)  lower  mean  serum 
creatinine values at Month 12 and higher mean calculated creatinine clearance values at multiple time 
points compared with those in Neoral/MMF group. 
Significantly fewer patients in the Prograf/MMF group (p=0.012, chi-square test) or the MR4/MMF 
group (p=0.040, chi-square test) received anti-lymphocyte antibody therapy for treatment of rejection 
compared with those in the Neoral/MMF treatment group. 
Fewer patients in either the Prograf/MMF treatment group or the MR4/MMF group discontinued the 
study  due  to  rejection  compared  with  those  in  the  Neoral/MMF  treatment  group  (none  and  0.5% 
versus 7.5%, p<0.001, chi-square test). 
Significantly  fewer  (p  < 0.001;  chi-square  test)  patients  in  the  MR4/MMF  treatment  group,  or 
Prograf/MMF  treatment  group,  experienced  treatment  failure  or  crossover  due  to  treatment  failure 
compared with patients in the Neoral/MMF treatment group. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroups:  age  (too  small  >65  years  population),  sex,  sex-mismatched  graft  (too  small  population), 
race (too small black population); ethnicity; diabetes at baseline, donor type, and geographic region. 
Numerically  lower  efficacy  failure  rates  and  incidence  of  BCAR  were  seen  with  the  elderly  (≥  65 
years  of  age)  compared  with  non-elderly  (<  65  years  old)  across  all  three  treatment  Groups.  But 
sample  size  of  the  elderly  population  was  small,  as  were  event  rates  for  death  and  graft  failure; 
therefore, comparisons should be made with caution. 
Sex. A numerically higher incidence of BCAR (10.5% vs. 5.9%) was observed in females compared to 
males  for  both  Prograf/MMF  and  MR4/MMF:  the  opposite  was  true  for  the  Neoral/MMF  treatment 
group. The incidence of BCAR was significantly lower for male patients in the Prograf/MMF (p-value 
= 0.012; chi-square test) and MR4/MMF (p-value =0.010; chi-square test) treatment groups compared 
to the Neoral/MMF treatment group. 
Race.  
Non-Caucasian  patients  were  under-represented.    Comparisons  of  the  composite  endpoint  and  the 
individual  components  of  this  composite  endpoint  in  white  and  black  transplant  recipients  are 
presented in Table 21

Diabetes.  There  were  no  apparent,  clinically  significant  differences  in  efficacy  failure  or  its 
components  based  on  the  presence  of  diabetes  at  baseline  within  the  three  treatment  groups.  The 
incidence of death for patients who did not have diabetes at baseline was significantly higher (9/152, 
5.9% vs 2/154, 1.3%; p-value = 0.030; chi-square test) in the Prograf/MMF treatment group compared 
to the Neoral/MMF treatment group. 
Donor  type.  Efficacy  failure  rates  were  numerically  higher  in  patients  who  received  grafts  from 
deceased donors compared with those who received grafts from living donors in the Prograf/MMF and 
Neoral/MMF  treatment  groups.  The  efficacy  failure  rate  was  similar  for  both  cohorts  in  the 
MR4/MMF  treatment  group.  In  patients  who  received  grafts  from  a  deceased  donor,  the  efficacy 
failure  rate  was  numerically  lower  in  the  Prograf/MMF  and  MR4/MMF  treatment  groups  and  the 
incidence of BCAR was significantly lower in the Prograf/MMF (p-value = 0.006; chi-square test) and 
MR4/MMF  (p-value  =  0.015;  chi-square  test)  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  Neoral/MMF 
treatment  group.  It  should  be  noted  that  event  rates  for  death  and  graft  failure  were  low;  therefore, 
comparisons should be made with caution. 
Geography.  Efficacy  failure  rates  were  numerically  higher  in  Brazilian  patients  who  received 
Prograf/MMF (6/30, 20% vs 26/182, 14%) or MR4/MMF (5/31, 16.1% vs. 25/183, 13.7%) compared 
to  patients  in  the  US  and  Canada.  The  efficacy  failure  rate  was  similar  for  both  cohorts  in  the 
Neoral/MMF  treatment  group.  There  was  a  significantly  (4/30,  13.3%  vs  5/182,  2.7%;  p-value  = 
0.038;  chi-square  test)  higher  incidence  of  graft  failure  for  Brazilian  patients  who  received 
Prograf/MMF compared with those who received Neoral/MMF. 
High-risk population.
Out of 426 patients who received MR4 or Prograf, 15 patients were undergoing re-transplantation and 
53 patients had a panel reactive antibody (PRA) grade > 0%.  The subgroup of patients who were re-
transplanted  and  who  received  MR4  (N=8)  had  100%  patient  and  graft  survival  at  1  year 
post-transplant; freedom from biopsy-confirmed acute rejection was 75.0%.  The subgroup of patients 
with PRA grade > 0% and who received MR4 (N=27) included 1 patient with graft failure at 1 year 
post-transplant; freedom from biopsy-confirmed acute rejection was 77.8%.  The subgroup of patients 
who  were  re-transplanted  and  who  received  Prograf  (N=7)  had  100%  patient  and  graft  survival  and 
freedom  from  biopsy-confirmed  acute  rejection  at  1  year  post-transplant.    The  subgroup  of  patients 
with PRA grade > 0% and who received Prograf (N=26) included 2 patients with graft failure at 1 year 
post-transplant; freedom from biopsy-confirmed acute rejection was 92.3%.   
Although the number of ‘high risk’ patients included in the clinical studies performed with MR4 to-
date  was  relatively  low,  there  was  no  indication  of  reduced  efficacy  for  MR4  in  these  patients.    A 
warning  has  been  added  to  SPC  section  4.4,  stating  the  limited  experience  in  patients  at  elevated 
immunological risk. 
Conversion from twice daily Prograf to once daily MR4 in transplant recipients 
Clinical  development  programme  of  conversion  from  twice  daily  Prograf  to  once  daily  MR4  in 
transplant patient included five adult Phase II studies (N=339) performed in stable (at least 6 months 
post  transplant):  adult  kidney  (three  studies:  02-0-131,  FG-506E-12-02,  and  FJ-506E-KT01,  Japan 
study),  liver  (study  02-0-152)  and  heart  (study  FG-506-15-02)  transplant  recipients.  These  studies 
25/35 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were 2 to 12 weeks PK evaluation studies, without primary efficacy endpoint (but one, Japan study). 
Incidences of acute rejection, and patient and graft survival were captured as safety parameters.  Three 
studies  relevant  for  claimed  indication  have  planned  1  to  3  year  long-term  extension  periods:  two 
kidney studies (02-0-131 and FG-506E-12-02, as a FG-506E-14-02) and liver study (02-0-152).  
Study FG-506E-12-02. This was a 4-period crossover replicate design, comparative study performed 
in  stable,  adult  Kidney  transplant  recipients  (at  least  6  months  post-transplant)  evaluated  the 
equivalence of tacrolimus exposure (AUC0-24) for MR4 versus Prograf under steady state conditions. 
Mean oral daily doses were comparable among groups. The mean whole blood trough concentrations 
were  lower  in  the  MR4  treatment  periods  than  in  the  Prograf  treatment  periods  (6.4  ng/mL  vs  7.7 
ng/mL at Day 7). 
Study  FG-506E-14-02:  This  was  a  multi-centre,  open-label,  prospective,  single-arm  study  to  assess 
the safety and efficacy of MR4 as long term treatment in converted kidney transplant patients. Patient 
survival and graft survival (> 1 year) with MR4 were consistent across all conversion studies, ranging 
from  97%  to  100%.  There  were  no  biopsy-confirmed  acute  rejections  in  Study  FG506E-12-02;  in 
Study 02-0-131, also performed in stable kidney transplant recipients converted from Prograf to MR4, 
the incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection at 2 years post-conversion was 6.0% (4/67 patients).  
In Study 02-0-152, performed in stable liver transplant recipients, the incidence of biopsy-confirmed 
acute  rejection  at  2  years  post-conversion  was  5.8%  (4/69  patients).  The  incidence  of  biopsy-
confirmed acute rejection in stable heart transplant recipients (Study FG-506-15-02) was 3.8% (3/79 
patients).  Efficacy  was  maintained  in  terms  of  patient  and  graft  survival  and  prevention  of  biopsy-
confirmed acute rejection up to 2 years post-conversion from twice daily Prograf to once daily MR4. 
In  summary,  across  the  conversion  studies,  tacrolimus  trough  levels  remained  stable  in  studied 
population after conversion to MR4 and the majority of patients remained at their original 'conversion' 
dose level long-term. Where dose changes were performed these were usually small dose corrections 
of approximately 1 mg/day. 
Rescue therapy 
There have been no studies performed with MR4 to investigate the treatment of rejection in transplant 
recipients; however, since tacrolimus is the active substance in MR4 and Prograf, mechanism of action 
is  the  same  and  since  the  therapeutic  equivalence  of  Prograf  and  MR4  has  been  demonstrated  in 
kidney, liver and heart transplantation, it is proposed to expect that MR4 is safe and effective in the 
treatment of rejection in these indications at similar doses and MR4 is expected to be therapeutically 
equivalent in these indications at similar doses.  
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  applicant  has  demonstrated  in  a  Phase  III  trial  in  renal  transplantation  that  tacrolimus  in  its 
Prograf  and  MR4  formulations  are  therapeutically  equivalent  as  prophylaxis  in  de  novo  renal 
transplantation.  Ideally,  it  might  have  been  desirable  to  demonstrate  such  equivalence  in  Phase  III 
trials  in  all  organ  transplant  situations  in  which  a  therapeutic  indication  is  sought.  However,  sound 
evidence  was  provided  that  the  exposure  (AUC)  generated  by  the  two  formulations  is  almost 
equivalent  on  a  milligram  for  milligram  basis  in  adult  cardiac  and  liver  transplantation  and  renal 
transplantation.  It  is  therefore  highly  unlikely  that  there  would  be  differences  in  clinical  safety  or 
efficacy in such settings and the PK data are accepted as a valid surrogate.  
Clinical safety 
The active substance in MR4, tacrolimus, is identical to that in the established formulation, Prograf.   
Consequently, the approach to assess the safety profile of MR4 administered to transplant recipients 
was to compare against the established safety profile for Prograf.

Three hundred and forty-one patients received MR4-based immunosuppression in de novo kidney and 
liver transplantation studies.  A further 348 patients (including 19 paediatric patients) were converted 
from  Prograf-based  immunosuppression  to  MR4-based  immunosuppression  (kidney,  liver  and  heart 
transplantation).  Two hundred and forty-two healthy volunteers received MR4 during Phase I studies.

Overall, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events considered by the investigator to be related (possible, probable, 
definite) to both primary study drug and MMF and to primary study drug only was similar among the three treatment groups. 
Any notable differences in the incidence of adverse events considered by the investigator to be related to both primary study 
drug and MMF (e.g., diarrhea, tremor) and primary study drug only (tremor, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia) were not 
unexpected and consistent with the safety profiles for Prograf and Neoral.

A  summary  of  the  incidence  of  mortality  in  Study 02-0-158  is  presented  in  Table  24  and  treatment 
emergent  serious  adverse  events  in  Table  25.  Approximately  21%  to  23%  of  the  patients  in  each 
treatment  group  experienced  a  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  event  considered  by  the 
investigator to be related to primary study drug.  The overall incidence of serious adverse events was 
similar  among  the  three  treatment  groups,  and  was  consistent  with  the  established  safety  profile  of 
tacrolimus and ciclosporin.

The incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment was significantly greater in the 
Neoral  group  than  the  MR4  group  (p = 0.010;  Fisher’s  exact  test)  and  numerically  greater  than  the 
Prograf group.  The most common treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation were 
nephropathy toxic (4/212; 1.9% Neoral group only), gingival hyperplasia (4/212; 1.9% Neoral group 
only), drug toxicity (3/212; 1.4% Neoral group only), and graft dysfunction (3/212; 1.4% Neoral and 
2/214, 0.9% MR4 groups)  
•  Post marketing experience 
To  date  MR4  has  not  been  approved  or  marketed  anywhere  worldwide;  however,  tacrolimus  is 
approved in more than 70 countries for use in organ transplantation and has been on the market for 
more  than  10  years.  Since  the  first  marketing  authorisation,  experience  with  the  intravenous  and 
Prograf capsule formulations of tacrolimus has been extensive, both through exposure to the marketed 
product  and  through  clinical  studies;  e.g.  in  the  period  April  2004  to  March  2005  the  exposure  to 
tacrolimus was estimated as 210,000 patient years worldwide. 
All  safety  information  is  presented  using  the  MedDRA  terminology,  and  Prograf  G-CCSI  4.0  as  a 
basis. Section 4.8 (Undesirable Effects) of the proposed Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for 
MR4 in Europe are listed in MedDRA and summarises the data on safety. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
MR4  is  a  reasonably  well  tolerated  with  two  main  types  of  ADRs:  (1)  those  caused  by  (over)-
immunosuppression  and  (2)  those  caused  by  drug  toxicity  that  are  mainly  dose  dependent.  Safety 
database  for  tacrolimus  is  quite  comprehensive.  Maintenance  of  whole  blood  concentrations  within 
therapeutic  range  improves  clinical  safety  of  tacrolimus.  MR4  clinical  development  encompasses  an 
additional safety experience of dual therapy using MMF as concomitant drug.

The proposed MR4 SPC indicates in Section 
4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use” 
that due to the lack of data, MR4 should not be 
used for the treatment of children and as 
primary therapy in heart transplant recipients 
Warnings in Section 4.4  and 4.5 of the SPC.  
Warnings and Section 4.4 of the proposed 
MR4 SPC as follows: 
During the initial post-transplant period, 
monitoring of the following parameters should 
be undertaken on a routine basis: blood 
pressure, ECG, neurological and visual status, 
fasting blood glucose levels, electrolytes 
(particularly potassium), liver and renal 
function tests, haematology parameters, 
coagulation values, and plasma protein 
determinations.  If clinically relevant changes 
are seen, adjustments of the 
immunosuppressive regimen should be 
considered. 
Mentioned in section 4.8 of the SPC 
Warnings in Section 4.4 of the proposed MR4 
SPC as follows: 
Ventricular hypertrophy or hypertrophy of the 
septum reported as cardiomyopathies, have 
been observed in Prograf treated patients on 
rare occasions and may therefore also occur 
with Advagraf.  Most cases have been 
reversible, occurring with tacrolimus blood 
trough concentrations much higher than the 
recommended maximum levels. Other factors 
observed to increase the risk of these clinical 
conditions included pre-existing heart disease, 
corticosteroid usage, hypertension,  
renal or hepatic dysfunction, infections, fluid 
overload, and oedema. Accordingly, high-risk 
patients receiving substantial 
immunosuppression should be monitored, 
using such procedures as echocardiography or 
ECG pre- and post-transplant (e.g. initially at 
3 months and then at 9 to 12 months).  If

abnormalities develop, dose reduction of MR4 
therapy, or change of treatment to another 
immunosuppressive agent should be 
considered. Tacrolimus may prolong the QT 
interval but at this time lacks substantial 
evidence for causing Torsades de Pointes. 
Caution should be exercised in patients with 
diagnosed or suspected Congenital Long QT 
Syndrome. 
Mentioned in section 4.8 of the SPC 
Warnings in Section 4.4 of the proposed MR4 
SPC as follows: 
Since levels of tacrolimus in blood may 
significantly change during diarrhoea episodes, 
extra monitoring of tacrolimus concentrations 
is recommended during episodes of diarrhoea. 
Mentioned in section 4.8 of the SPC 
Warnings in Section 4.4 of the proposed MR4 
SPC as follows: 
As with other potent immunosuppressive 
compounds, the risk of secondary cancer is 
unknown (see Section 4.8).  
As with other immunosuppressive agents, 
owing to the potential risk of malignant skin 
changes, exposure to sunlight and UV light 
should be limited by wearing protective 
clothing and using a sunscreen with a high 
protection factor. 
Mention in section 4.8 of the SPC 
Statement  in Section 4.4 of the proposed MR4 
SPC as follows: 
Patients treated with tacrolimus have been 
reported to develop EBV-associated 
lymphoproliferative disorders. A combination 
of immunosuppressives such as 
antilymphocytic antibodies given 
concomitantly increases the risk of EBV-
associated lymphoproliferative disorders. 
EBV-viral capsid antigen (VCA)-negative 
patients have been reported to have an 
increased risk of developing 
lymphoproliferative disorders. Therefore, in 
this patient group, EBV-VCA serology should 
be ascertained before starting treatment with 
Advagraf. During treatment, careful 
monitoring with EBV-PCR is recommended. 
Positive EBV-PCR may persist for months and 
is per se not indicative of lymphoproliferative 
disease or lymphoma. 
Mention in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Statement in Section 4.6 of the proposed MR4 
SPC as follows: 
Human data show that tacrolimus crosses the 
placenta. Limited data from organ transplant 
recipients show no evidence of an increased 
risk of adverse events on the course and

outcome of pregnancy under tacrolimus 
treatment compared with other 
immunosuppressive medicinal products. To 
date, no other relevant epidemiological data 
are available. Tacrolimus treatment can be 
considered in pregnant women, when there is 
no safer alternative and when the perceived 
benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
In case of in utero exposure, monitoring of the 
newborn for the potential adverse events of 
tacrolimus is recommended (in particular the 
effects on the kidneys). There is a risk for 
premature delivery (<37 week) as well as for 
hyperkalaemia in the newborn.  
Statement in Section 4.6 of the proposed MR4 
SPC as follows: 
Human data demonstrate that tacrolimus is 
excreted in breast milk. As detrimental effects 
on the newborn cannot be excluded, women 
should not breast-feed whilst receiving 
Advagraf.

Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are 
no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The  active  substance,  tacrolimus,  belongs  to  the  pharmacological  class  of  calcineurin  inhibitors  and 
originally derives from the fungus streptomyces tsukubaensis: it has a macrolide structure.  Advagraf is a 
new  oral  formulation  of  tacrolimus  with  prolonged-release  characteristics  compared  to  the  currently 
authorised product Prograf(t). No new preclinical studies were undertaken with the new formulation. 
The toxicity of tacrolimus has previously been well established with the organs of toxicity identified.  
As  regards  reproductive  potential  adverse  effects,  pre-clinical  reproductive  studies  of  tacrolimus 
suggest  the  possibility  of  a  detrimental  effect  on  male  and  female  reproduction.      An  appropriate 
warning has been added to the SPC. 
Efficacy 
The applicant has demonstrated that the prolonged release MR4 formulation is exchangeable for the 
Prograf formulation on a weight for weight basis. In a repeat dose situation it gives a slightly lower 
Cmax and AUC than Prograf dosed twice daily but there is less diurnal variation in drug level. One 
Phase III study in renal transplantation shows therapeutic equivalence between the two formulations, 
and pharmacokinetic data in other organ transplantations are used to extrapolate to similar efficacy. 
Safety 
The safety of the prolonged released formulation of tacrolimus is consistent with that known for the 
Prograf formulation.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
•  Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that 
the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.  
•  User consultation 
User  testing  has  been  performed  on  the  Patient  Information  Leaflet  and  from  the  results  it  can  be 
concluded that the relevant information is accessible and understandable for the patients. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
The  benefit  risk  of  Prograf  prolonged  released  hard  capsules  is  considered  as  positive.  It  has  an 
efficacy and safety profile comparable to the widely used immediate release formulation and offers an 
advantage in the convenience of once daily rather than twice daily dosing. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
(cid:131) 
(cid:131)  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.

Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Advagraf  in:  “Prophylaxis  of  transplant  rejection  in  adult 
kidney  or  liver  allograft  recipients.  Treatment  of  allograft  rejection  resistant  to  treatment  with  other 
immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult patients”, was favourable and therefore recommended  
the granting of the marketing authorisation.

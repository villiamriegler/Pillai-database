2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Kyprolis in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone, either with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone alone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy. 
Epidemiology  
Multiple myeloma, an oligoclonal neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells, is the second most common 
hematologic malignancy with an estimated incidence worldwide in 2018 of 159 985 persons (Ferlay et al, 
2018).  The 5-year prevalence of multiple myeloma worldwide was estimated at 376 005 persons.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/593622/2020 
Page 6/127 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Multiple myeloma may represent less than 1% of all cancer diagnoses but contributes to significant 
disease burden with over 2 million disability-adjusted life-years (Cowan et al, 2018; Bray et al, 2013).  
Despite recent therapeutic advances which have prolonged survival, multiple myeloma remains a fatal 
disease with nearly 100 000 annual deaths worldwide (1% of cancer deaths) (Cowan et al, 2018; 
Kazandjian, 2016; Ferlay et al, 2015). Multiple myeloma is a disease of older adults, with a median age at 
diagnosis of 69 years (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Stat Facts, 2019). 
Biologic features, clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Multiple myeloma is characterized by a recurring pattern of remission and relapse (Laubach et al, 2016; 
Durie et al, 2012; Jakubowiak et al, 2012). With each successive line of treatment, patients have lower 
response rates and a shorter duration of response (Kumar et al, 2012), remissions become increasingly 
transient, and the disease eventually becomes refractory (nonresponsive to the most recent therapy or 
progression within 60 days of discontinuation from the most recent therapy) (Laubach et al, 2016).  Thus, 
a need exists for new combination regimens to treat relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
Management 
The primary goals of treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma are to achieve deep and 
durable response and subsequently longer survival with an acceptable level of toxicity.  Additional goals 
are to prevent or delay disease-related morbidity (including bone fractures and renal insufficiency), to 
provide relief from pain and other disease-related symptoms, and to maintain the best possible quality of 
life (World Health Organization, 2019; Landgren and Iskander, 2017; Durie, 2010; Durie, 2005). 
Regimens used and/or approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma incorporate conventional agents 
such as alkylating agents, anthracyclines, and corticosteroids, as well as novel agents including 
immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and histone deacetylase 
inhibitors (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2020; Moreau et al, 2017).  The novel and 
conventional agents are typically combined as doublet or triplet regimens and are sequenced across 
multiple lines of therapy.  Treatments for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma that are either NCCN 
preferred regimens or European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) major regimens are listed in table 
1.

or moderate evidence for efficacy but with a limited clinical benefit, generally recommended; C = insufficient evidence for efficacy or 
benefit does not outweigh the risk or disadvantages (adverse events, costs, etc), optional 
Source:  NCCN, 2020 and Moreau et al, 2017  
Current treatment guidelines by NCCN and ESMO recommend regimens containing an IMiD for frontline 
therapy as well as lenalidomide for maintenance therapy, which has become standard of care 
(NCCN, 2020; Facon et al, 2018; Pulte et al, 2018; Moreau et al, 2017; McCarthy et al, 2017).     
Despite recent therapeutic advances, relapse is virtually inevitable and patients can become refractory to 
IMiDs (Nijhof et al, 2018; Sonneveld et al, 2017; Cornell and Kassim, 2016).  Outcomes tend to be worse 
for patients who are refractory to lenalidomide than the overall population (Moreau et al, 2019. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Carfilzomib, a tetrapeptide epoxyketone, is a highly selective, irreversible second generation proteasome 
inhibitor. The epoxyketone pharmacophore of carfilzomib forms an irreversible, covalent adduct with the 
N-terminal threonine residue of the chymotrypsin-like active site of the 20S proteasome, while sparing 
nonproteosomal sites.  As a result, proteasome substrates accumulate, ultimately stimulating arrest and 
apoptosis of tumor cells. 
Kyprolis (carfilzomib), is currently approved in the EU for the following indication: 
“Kyprolis in combination with either lenalidomide and dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior 
therapy (see section 5.1)”.  
The purpose of this marketing application is to support a new indication for carfilzomib, dexamethasone, 
plus daratumumab (KdD) in the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at 
least 1 prior therapy.  The key clinical study that contributed to the development of the KdD dose 
regimen is CANDOR, a phase 3, open-label, randomized study comparing KdD 20/56 mg/m2 twice-weekly 
versus Kd 20/56 mg/m2 twice-weekly in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have 
received 1 to 3 lines of therapy. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific advice on the CANDOR study design was not obtained from regulatory authorities within the EU. 
However, a Type B pre-phase 3 meeting was held with the US Food and Drug Administration on 20 
October 2016.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. The only new data submitted were related to ERA. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
A new ERA for Carfilzomib is submitted to update the data related to the variation 
(EMEA/H/C/003790/II/0001/G). In this variation, Carfilzomib is used in combination with dexamethasone 
for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA was submitted based on the EMA guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use. Accordingly, Phase I was conducted by calculating both PBT and PECsw.  
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) 
Octanol-water partition coefficient was calculated in an OECD107 study. The final report was submitted in 
a previous variation (EMEA/H/C/003790/II/0001/G) in december2015 (table below).

Given that the value for Pow was above 4.5, an initial PBT assessment was performed via OECD308 test 
(Aerobic and Anaerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems). The results of this test were 
submitted in a type IB variation (EMEA/H/C003790/IB/0014). In this test, Carfilzomib showed a DT50 of 
0.5 days and a DT90 <2 days. Two degradation products were identified (metabolite K and 2-
morpholineacetic acid). The degradation kinetics is shown below:

However, bound residues and carbon dioxide accounted for 37.5% after 29 days and 43.1% after 99 
days, which would indicate the extensive mineralization of Carfilzomib in natural biotic systems.   
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
PEC surface water calculation was based on a revised Fpen, according to Questions and Answers EMA 
guidance document. The value of Pregion (prevalence) for a worst-case estimation was 3.72 people in 
10000, taken from the Orphan Maintenance Report to the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.  
Pregion = Prevalence for particular region (0.000372 patients/inhabitants) 
ttreatment = Duration of one treatment period (6 days) 
ntreatment = Number of treatment period per year (13 year-1) 
Nd = Number of days per year (365 days/year) 
Fprevalence = resulted in 0.0000795 
The result of the estimation of total prevalence (0.0000795) was incorporated to the PECsw calculation, 
resulting in a value of 0.0049 µg/L. 
DOSEai = maximum recommended daily dose of active ingredient for the indication (123 mg/inh*day) 
Fprevalence = prevalence obtained from the previous formula (0.0000795) 
WasteWinhab = amount of wastewater discharged per person in a population per day (assumed to be 200 L) 
DILUTION = surface water dilution (assumed to be 10) 
PECsurfacewater=0.0049 µg/L 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In the context of the extension of indication an updated ERA for Carfilzomib was presented by the 
Applicant.  
Phase I assessment was reported and  resulted in a PECsw surface water value below the action limit of 
0.01, so no additional studies would be required. As for PBT assessment, although logKow value was 4.6, 
further tests (OECD308) showed that carfilzomib is extensively degraded in aquatic systems.  
The transformation product (TP) 2-morpholino-acetic-acid is rapidly formed to an extent of 85% and just 
slowly degraded (DT50 values of 237 und 303 d after normalization to 12°C). However, it is noted that 
although the TP 2-morpholino-acetic acid is classified as very persistent, it shows a logKOW of -0.955. 
Consequently, no further B assessment is required and the PBT assessment can stop at this stage.

Testing the B-criteria for the active ingredient itself is not required.  
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, Carfilzomib should be used according to the precautions stated in the SPC in 
order to minimize any potential risks to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The clinical data to support the extension of indication of carfilzomib “in combination with daratumumab 
and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 
one  prior  therapy”  is  supported  by  a  randomized,  Open-label,  Phase  3  Study  Comparing  Carfilzomib, 
Dexamethasone, and Daratumumab (KdD) to Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone (Kd) : the CANDOR study. 
GCP 
This study was conducted in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) regulations/guidelines. Essential documents will be retained in accordance with ICH GCP.

Absorption 
The Cmax and AUC following a 2 to 10 minute intravenous infusion of 27 mg/m2 was 4,232 ng/mL and 379 
ng•hr/mL, respectively. Following repeated doses of Kyprolis at 15 and 20 mg/m2, systemic exposure 
(AUC) and half-life were similar on days 1 and 15 or 16 of cycle 1, suggesting there was no systemic 
carfilzomib accumulation. At doses between 20 and 56 mg/m2, there was a dose-dependent increase in 
exposure.  
A 30 minute infusion resulted in a similar half-life and AUC, but 2- to 3-fold lower Cmax compared to that 
observed with a 2 to 10 minute infusion of the same dose. Following a 30 minute infusion of the 56 
mg/m2 dose, the AUC (948 ng•hr/mL) was approximately 2.5-fold that observed at the 27 mg/m2 level, 
and Cmax (2,079 ng/mL) was lower compared to that of 27 mg/m2 over the 2 to 10 minute infusion.  
Distribution 
The mean steady-state volume of distribution of a 20 mg/m2 dose of carfilzomib was 28 L. When tested in 
vitro, the binding of carfilzomib to human plasma proteins averaged 97% over the concentration range of 
0.4 to 4 micromolar. 
Biotransformation 
Carfilzomib was rapidly and extensively metabolised. The predominant metabolites measured in human 
plasma and urine, and generated in vitro by human hepatocytes, were peptide fragments and the diol of 
carfilzomib, suggesting that peptidase cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis were the principal pathways of 
metabolism. Cytochrome P450 mediated mechanisms played a minor role in overall carfilzomib 
metabolism. The metabolites have no known biologic activity. 
Elimination 
Following intravenous administration of doses ≥ 15 mg/m2, carfilzomib was rapidly cleared from the 
systemic circulation with a half-life of ≤ 1 hour on day 1 of cycle 1. The systemic clearance ranged from 151 
to 263 L/hour, and exceeded hepatic blood flow, suggesting that carfilzomib was largely cleared 
extrahepatically. Carfilzomib is eliminated primarily via metabolism with subsequent excretion of its 
metabolites in urine.  
Pharmacokinetics of daratumumab 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of daratumumab following intravenous administration of daratumumab 
monotherapy were evaluated in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma at dose levels 
from 0.1 mg/kg to 24 mg/kg. 
In the 1 to 24 mg/kg cohorts, peak serum concentrations (Cmax) after the first dose increased in 
approximate proportion to dose and volume of distribution was consistent with initial distribution into the 
plasma compartment. Following the last weekly infusion, Cmax increased in a greater than dose-
proportional manner, consistent with target mediated drug disposition. Increases in AUC were more than 
dose-proportional and clearance (CL) decreased with increasing dose. These observations suggest CD38 
may become saturated at higher doses, after which the impact of target binding clearance is minimised 
and the clearance of daratumumab approximates the linear clearance of endogenous IgG1. Clearance 
also decreased with multiple doses, which may be related to tumour burden decreases.

Terminal half-life increases with increasing dose and with repeated dosing. The mean (standard deviation 
[SD]) estimated terminal half-life of daratumumab following the first 16 mg/kg dose was 9 (4.3) days. 
The estimated terminal half-life of daratumumab following the last 16 mg/kg dose increased, but there 
are insufficient data for a reliable estimation. Based on population PK analysis, the mean (SD) half-life 
associated with non-specific linear elimination was approximately 18 (9) days; this is the terminal half-life 
that can be expected upon complete saturation of target mediated clearance and repeat dosing of 
daratumumab. 
At the end of weekly dosing for the recommended monotherapy schedule and dose of 16 mg/kg, the 
mean (SD) serum Cmax value was 915 (410.3) micrograms/mL, approximately 2.9-fold higher than 
following the first infusion. The mean (SD) predose (trough) serum concentration at the end of weekly 
dosing was 573 (331.5) micrograms/mL.

The final PPK dataset contains measurable 1,556 daratumumab PK samples from 375 subjects. The lower 
limit of quantification for daratumumab is 0.2 μg/mL. The percentage of BQL sample out of total number 
of post-treatment PK samples (excluding “Not done” samples) is <3%. As prespecified in the analysis 
plan (Appendix 2), they were excluded from the PPK analysis.

Base PK model 
The previously developed final structural and covariate model for daratumumab IV monotherapy was 
used to fit the concentration-time data of daratumumab in RRMM patients who received DKd combination 
therapy (Study 20160725 and MMY1001 DKd arm). These models have been successfully implemented in 
subjects with RRMM following both daratumumab monotherapy and other combination therapies. 
The developed base PPK model for IV administration included 2-compartment structure with parallel 
linear and Michaelis-Menten nonlinear elimination pathways.14 The model structure for daratumumab PK 
is provided in Figure 2.

EMA/CHMP/593622/2020 
Page 18/127 
 
 
  
  
 
The linear clearance represents the nonspecific clearance for IgG and the Michaelis-Menten elimination 
represents the saturable target-mediated clearance. Due to the treatment effect of daratumumab, the 
total target (CD38) level decreased over time. This was investigated using an empirical function: 
in which TDVM represents the time-dependent maximum capacity of the saturable clearance and KDES 
represents first-order rate constant, describing the decrease of the maximum velocity of the saturable 
clearance process (Vmax) over time (t).  
The IIV in structural parameters was modeled with an exponential term to ensure positive values of 
individual parameters. Because the serum concentrations were log-transformed, an additive model was 
used to model residual variability. 
The final covariate model based on the daratumumab IV studies developed previously includes body 
weight, albumin, type of myeloma, and sex as statistically significant (but not clinically relevant) 
covariates.14 In case some parameters could not be reliably estimated, due to limited sparse sampling in 
Studies CANDOR and MMY1001, the models (eg, number of random-effects parameters) were reduced to 
avoid over-parameterization. 
The previous PPK analysis showed that the PK of daratumumab could be adequately described by a 2-
compartment PPK model with parallel linear and nonlinear (Michaelis-Menten) elimination pathways 
following both monotherapy and combination therapies. 
The serum concentration-time profiles for daratumumab are similar between subjects in Studies CANDOR 
and MMY1001 (Figure 3) and subjects in monotherapy studies and other combination studies (Figure 4 
and Figure 5, respectively), further confirming the hypothesis and validating the applicability of the 
previously developed PPK model for the analysis herein. To stabilize the model fitting, the body weight 
effect on clearance and volume of distribution in the central compartment (V1) were fixed to the plausible 
allometric scaling exponent of 0.75 and 1, respectively, in the base model.

Final PK model 
After the based model was confirmed (eg, plausible PPK parameters estimates and adequate goodness-
of-fit), a final model was established by including those significant covariates that were identified from 
the previous daratumumab PPK analysis. In the meantime, the model was further fine-tuned with the 
goal of obtaining a parsimonious model.  
The estimated linear clearance (0.00393 L/h) was similar to the clearance of nonspecific endogenous IgG 
reported in the literature and the estimated V1 (4.47 L) approached plasma volume. The model-derived 
geometric mean (coefficient of variation %) half-life associated with linear elimination was 23.8 (16%) 
days, comparable to the estimated half-lives derived from the previous monotherapy and combination 
therapy data (an average of 15 to 23 days). 
The IIV of was 43.7% and 38.3% for linear clearance and V1, respectively. The associated ETA shrinkage 
was 7.63% and 27.9% for linear clearance and V1, respectively, suggesting that individual estimates for 
these 2 parameters were adequately characterized without shrinking to the population mean. 
The condition number of the final model is 30.67, indicating the final covariate model is appropriately 
parameterized (ie, no issues of over-parameterization).

Attachment 6 includes the basic goodness-of-fit plots for the final PK model. The plots of population and 
individual predictions versus observations show that the individual predictions fitted well along the 
identity line and the conditionally weighted residuals were generally centered along the zero line with 
homogenous variation relative to the population predictions and time, suggesting an adequate fit of the 
final model to the overall study data.

Comparison of daratumumab exposure in subpopulations was based on simulation assuming that all 
subjects received 16 mg/kg daratumumab in the same dose schedules as in Study CANDOR. Figure 6 
shows the forest plot of subgroup analyses on the exposure metrics of predicted maximal trough 
concentrations (preinfusion concentration of the first dose of the Q2W dose schedule, ie, Cycle 3 Day 1 
[C3D1]) in the same dose schedule as in Study CANDOR. The selection of this exposure metric was based 
on the cumulative knowledge of its clinical relevance found in the prior E-R analysis for daratumumab.

Carfilzomib 
Exploratory data analysis 
Carfilzomib was administered as monotherapy in studies PX-171-003 – Part 2 (A1), PX-171-004, PX-171-
005, CFZ001, and CFZ002; in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in studies PX-171-006 
and PX-171-009; as monotherapy or in combination with low-dose dexamethasone in PX-171-007, 2011-
003, 2012-002, 20140355, 20140242 and the control arm of 20160275; in combination with low dose 
dexamethasone and daratumumab in the experimental arm of 20160275 and in the carfilzomib + 
dexamethasone and daratumumab arm of MMY1001 (Amgen Study 20190252). The pooled dataset 
contained 8279 plasma concentrations of carfilzomib from 1318 subjects. 
In the pooled dataset, the median age of subjects was 64 years and ranged from 21 to 89 years. The 
median body weight was 76 kg and ranged from 36 to 165 kg. In total, 770 male and 548 female 
subjects were included in the analysis, and 74.05% were white, 9.45% Asian, 6.37% black, 0.68% 
Hispanic, and 9.45% other.

Based on a previously published model of carfilzomib (Ou, 2017), a two-compartment pharmacokinetic 
model with intravenous (IV) infusion and first order elimination processes, with an effect of BSA on 
clearance, was expected to sufficiently characterize the carfilzomib pharmacokinetic disposition. The two-
compartment model was parameterized in terms of systemic clearance (CL), volume of distribution for 
the central compartment (V1), volume of distribution for the peripheral compartment (V2), 
intercompartmental clearance between central and peripheral compartment (Q). Since the updated 
dataset consists mostly of data from Phase 3 studies with sparse PK sampling, which are not designed to 
characterize the PK behaviour of carfilzomib, the published model was used as the base model. 
A separate error model between intense and sparse sampling studies was used in the base structural PK 
model. Incorporation of a full block OMEGA matrix led to a decrease in the objective function value and 
therefore the structure was retained in the base model. 
The two-compartment model with IIVs estimated for CL, V1, V2, Q, and covariate effect of BSA on CL 
deemed appropriate as the structural population PK model. All PK parameters were estimated with good 
precision (RSE% < 20%). The shrinkage on CL, V1, V2, and Q were 26.7%, 34.4, 33%, and 32%, 
respectively. Figure 2 shows the goodness-of-fit plots for the structural model. As shown in the upper 
panels, there was good agreement of the observed and the individual-level as well as population-level 
predicted concentrations. Also, CWRES showed random normal scatter around zero with no specific trends 
of bias across the range of predicted values and over time. Of note, the distribution of conditional 
weighted residuals versus time remains constant, which indicates the absence of time-dependent 
pharmacokinetics. Following the development of the base model, the effects of subject specific covariates 
on the random effects in the base structural model were explored graphically on key PK parameters. No 
new covariate relationship was found on any of the ETAs and therefore no further changes were made to 
the model.

Special populations 
Daratumumab 
Body weight 
When daratumumab was administered on a mg/kg basis, no clinically important differences (ie, <20%) in 
the exposure to daratumumab were observed in subjects with a low body weight (<65 kg, n=99) or high 
body weight (≥85 kg, n=95) compared to those with a body weight ranging from 65 to 85 kg (n=181). 
Age 
No clinically important influence of age on the exposure to daratumumab was observed. The exposure to 
daratumumab in older subjects (age ≥75 years, n=35) was similar to younger subjects (age <75 years, 
n=340) with a percent difference of <20%. 
Sex 
No clinically important influence of sex on the exposure to daratumumab was observed. The exposure to 
daratumumab in males (n=210) was similar to that in females (n=165). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/593622/2020 
Page 28/127 
 
 
  
  
 
Race 
Because the majority of subjects were white and there were only limited sample sizes in other race 
categories, the effect of race was evaluated as white (n=291) and non-white (n=84). No clinically 
important influence of race on the exposure to daratumumab was observed. The exposure to 
daratumumab in white subjects was similar to non-white subjects. 
Renal impairment 
No formal studies of daratumumab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Creatinine 
clearance is not a significant covariate on daratumumab clearance. No clinically important differences 
(<20%) in the exposure to daratumumab were observed between subjects with renal impairment and 
those with normal renal function. 
Hepatic impairment 
No formal studies of daratumumab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. No subjects 
had severe hepatic impairment (TB >3× upper limit of normal [ULN] and any AST), and only 2 subjects 
had moderate hepatic impairment (TB >1.5× to 3.0× ULN, as defined using the National Cancer Institute 
criteria of hepatic dysfunction). Therefore, the effect of hepatic impairment was evaluated in categories of 
normal hepatic function (TB and AST ≤ULN, n=338) and mild hepatic impairment (TB 1.0× to 1.5× ULN or 
AST >ULN, n=35). No clinically important differences in the exposure to daratumumab (<20%) were 
observed between subjects with mild hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function. 
Baseline Albumin 
No clinically important differences in the exposure to daratumumab were observed between subjects with 
different albumin levels. The exposure to daratumumab in subjects with albumin level below median 
value (<40 g/L, n=170) was 15% lower than that in subjects with albumin level above median value (≥40 
g/L, n=205). 
Type of Myeloma 
The exposure to daratumumab was approximately 22% (95% confidence interval: 27% - 16%) lower in 
subjects with IgG myeloma (n=209) compared with subjects with non-IgG myeloma (n=166), consistent 
with previous study results. As the treatment effect on efficacy endpoints was similar for subjects with 
IgG and non-IgG myeloma, this is considered not a clinically important effect. 
Carfilzomib 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib was studied in two dedicated renal impairment studies. The first 
study was conducted in 50 multiple myeloma patients with normal renal function (CrCL > 80 mL/min, n = 
12), mild (CrCL 50-80 mL/min, n = 12), moderate (CrCL 30-49 mL/min, n = 10), and severe (CrCL < 30 
mL/min, n = 8) renal impairment, and patients on chronic dialysis (n = 8). Kyprolis, as a single agent, 
was administered intravenously over 2 to 10 minutes at doses up to 20 mg/m2. Pharmacokinetic data 
were collected from patients following the 15 mg/m2 dose in cycle 1 and the 20 mg/m2 dose in cycle 2. 
The second study was conducted in 23 relapsed multiple myeloma patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 75 
mL/min (n = 13) and patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis (n = 10). 
Pharmacokinetic data were collected from patients following administration of a 27 mg/m2 dose as a 30 
minute infusion on cycle 1, day 16 and the 56 mg/m2 dose on cycle 2, day 1.  
Results from both studies show that renal function status had no marked effect on the exposure of 
carfilzomib following single or repeat-dose administration. The geometric mean ratio in AUClast at the 15 
mg/m2 dose cycle 1, day 1 for mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and chronic dialysis versus

normal renal function were 124.36%, 111.07%, 84.73% and 121.72%, respectively. The geometric mean 
ratios in AUClast at the 27 mg/m2 dose cycle 1, day 16 and at the 56 mg/m2 dose cycle 2, day 1 for ESRD 
versus normal renal function were 139.72% and 132.75%, respectively. In the first study the M14 
metabolite, a peptide fragment and the most abundant circulating metabolite, increased 2- and 3-fold in 
patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively, and 7-fold in patients requiring 
dialysis (based on AUClast). In the second study, the exposures for M14 were greater (approximately 4-
fold) in subjects with ESRD than in subjects with normal renal function. This metabolite has no known 
biological activities. Serious adverse events related to worsening renal function were more common in 
subjects with baseline renal dysfunction. 
Hepatic impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study evaluated 33 patients with relapsed or progressive advanced malignancies (solid 
tumours; n = 31 or haematologic malignancies; n = 2) who had normal hepatic function (bilirubin ≤ 
upper limit of normal [ULN]; aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ≤ ULN, n = 10), mild hepatic impairment 
(bilirubin > 1-1.5 × ULN or AST > ULN, but bilirubin ≤ ULN, n = 14), or moderate hepatic impairment 
(bilirubin > 1.5-3 × ULN; any AST, n = 9). The pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib has not been studied in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 × ULN and any AST). Kyprolis, as a single agent, 
was administered intravenously over 30 minutes at 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 and at 27 mg/m2 on days 
8, 9, 15 and 16 of cycle 1. If tolerated, patients received 56 mg/m2 starting in cycle 2. Baseline hepatic 
function status had no marked effect on the total systemic exposure (AUClast) of carfilzomib following 
single or repeat-dose administration (geometric mean ratio in AUClast at the 27 mg/m2 dose in cycle 1, 
day 16 for mild and moderate impairment versus normal hepatic function were 144.4% and 126.1%, 
respectively; and at the 56 mg/m2 dose in cycle 2, day 1 were 144.7% and 121.1%). However, in 
patients with mild or moderate baseline hepatic impairment, all of whom had solid tumours, there was a 
higher subject incidence of hepatic function abnormalities, ≥ grade 3 adverse events and serious adverse 
events compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
As from studies submitted in the context of the original MAA, carfilzomib, a tetrapeptide epoxyketone, is a 
highly selective, irreversible second-generation proteasome inhibitor that preferentially targets the 
chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activity of the 20S proteasome compared with the trypsin-like (T-L) and 
caspase-like (C-L) proteasome activities.  The 20S proteasome exists in 2 forms:  the constitutive 
proteasome, expressed ubiquitously throughout the body, and the immunoproteasome, expressed 
primarily in hematopoietic cells or in cytokine-exposed nonhematopoietic cells (Nandi et al, 1996; Glynne 
et al, 1991; Martinez and Monaco, 1991).  The 3 different catalytic activities of constitutive proteasome 
are encoded by the β5, β2, and β1 subunits based on their substrate specificity for the CT-L, T-L, and C-L 
activities, respectively.  In the immunoproteasome, low-molecular mass polypeptide 2 and 7 and 
multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1 replace β1, β5, and β2, respectively.  It has been shown that 
multiple myeloma cells express both constitutive and immunoproteasomes (Lee et al, 2016; Parlati et al, 
2009).  
The epoxyketone pharmacophore of carfilzomib forms an irreversible, covalent adduct with the N-terminal 
threonine residue of the CT-L active site of the 20S proteasome, while sparing nonproteosomal sites.  As 
a result, proteasome substrates accumulate, ultimately stimulating arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells 
(see SmPC section 5.1).

With regard to carfilzomib and daratumumab, no formal PK investigations of the DDI potential has been 
performed (see discussion of Clinical Pharmacology. 
Potential for drug-drug interaction of the KdD combination 
No formal investigations of the DDI potential between the components of the combination were 
performed. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Daratumumab 
None of the samples from subjects treated with KdD (300 subjects) were positive for antibodies to 
daratumumab, indicating a low risk of immunogenicity to daratumumab with this combination. Thus, 
immunogenicity is not expected to have an impact on daratumumab exposure, efficacy or safety. 
Exposure-efficacy 
The ORR increased rapidly to a maximum value with the increase of daratumumab exposure when 
daratumumab 16 mg/kg was coadministered with Kd based on the data from Studies CANDOR and 
MMY1001. In both studies, the ORR was very similar in Ctrough,max Q2-Q4 (ie, >90%), while the ORR in 
Ctrough,max Q1 was somewhat lower (Figure 12). There is no apparent impact of carfilzomib dosage 
regimen (56 mg/m2 twice weekly [BIW; 20 mg/m2 for the first 2 doses] in Study CANDOR and 70 
mg/m2 QW [20 mg/m2 for the first dose] in MMY1001) on daratumumab E-R relationship for ORR.

this analysis: 
•  Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of subjects achieving a best overall 
response of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial

for the pooled data. 
•  Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as duration in months from randomization to the earlier 
of documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. Subjects who did not have 
disease progression or death were censored. PFS was analyzed for each study separately and for 
the pooled data. 
•  MRD[-]CR at 12 months, defined as the proportion of subjects with a best overall response of

QTc analysis 
In the analysis dataset (N=382), the median age of subjects was 64 years and ranged from 29 to 84 
years. The median body weight was 75.4 kg and ranged from 36 to 143 kg. In total, 221 male and 161 
female subjects were included in the analysis. The summary statistics and distributions of body weight 
and age by gender are presented in Table 2. The summary statistics for the included PK and QTcF data 
are shown in Table 3. There were 628 pairs with median (range) concentration ΔQTcF values of 2.4 msec 
(-114 to 169 msec). The median predicted carfilzomib concentration was 1.60 ng/mL and ranged from 
0.00 to 15444.23 ng/mL. ΔQTcF values vs time after last dose are presented in Figure 1. 
A linear mixed effect model was used to characterize the carfilzomib concentration and ΔQTcF 
relationship,. The parameter estimates are summarized in Table 4. The slope of the relationship for 
plasma concentration of carfilzomib and QTcF change is 0.0009 msec/ng/mL. The 90% confidence 
interval for the slope is (-0.0007, 0.0027 msec/ng/mL), which includes 0 suggesting lack of QTcF-
exposure effect for carfilzomib. The intercept was estimated to be -21.55 msec. The p value for the slope 
of ΔQTcF vs carfilzomib concentration is >0.05 indicating lack of linear relationship between carfilzomib 
plasma concentration and ΔQTcF.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Daratumumab 
Exposure-efficacy 
An apparent maximal effect relationship was observed between the relative hazard of disease progression 
or death and daratumumab systemic exposures (Figure 9). The relative hazard for progression or death 
decreased rapidly with increasing daratumumab systemic exposure. For both Ctrough,1st and predicted 
maximal trough concentration (Ctrough,max) of daratumumab, when these numbers were greater than 
their respective first quartile (Q1) , the risk of progression or death was reduced by approximate 50% as 
compared to the control Kd group, indicating that the maximum effect on PFS had been attained for the 
majority of the subjects at the 16 mg/kg dose. 
A case-control analysis was conducted using the weighted Mahalanobis metric method to match the 
identified risk factors.15 After matching, a group of subjects in the Kd group with similar risk factors (Q1 
Kd match) as in the Q1 DKd group (Q1 DKd match) were identified, and the differences in the risk factors 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/593622/2020

were minimized (Attachment 17 and Attachment 18). The 2 matched treatment groups, Q1 DKd match 
and Q1 Kd match, appeared to be balanced. The results for the matched case-control analysis are shown 
in Figure 11. 
The improvement in PFS was observed in the majority of the daratumumab-treated subjects (exposure 
quartiles: Q2-Q4, 75%). In the case-control analysis, the improvement of PFS was apparent in the “Q1 
DKd match” group compared with the “Q1 Kd match” group for both first trough concentrations and 
maximum trough concentrations.  
In summary, the E-R analysis on efficacy data suggests that the maximum daratumumab effect on PFS 
had been attained for the majority of the subjects at the studied 16 mg/kg dose, and it appeared that 
subjects in the DKd arm of Study CANDOR benefited from the treatment with daratumumab evidenced by 
a lower relative risk of disease progression/death across the studied daratumumab concentration range 
compared with the subjects in the Kd arm. 
Exposure-safety 
There was no apparent E-R relationship between Cpeak,max and IRR, thrombocytopenia, anemia,

Exposure-efficacy 
The summary of the exposure metrics (AUC and Cmax) available from Study 20160275 (CANDOR) based 
on individual PK parameter estimates from the final population PK model and individual dosing history is 
presented The time-to-event analysis for PFS was performed in subjects based on carfilzomib exposure 
(AUC or Cmax). 
The exposure-response analysis of efficacy endpoints in subjects from Study 20160275 alone, in which all 
subjects received a 20/56 mg/m2 dose of carfilzomib, with or without daratumomab, did not show any 
statistically significant relationship between carfilzomib exposure and the primary efficacy endpoints, PFS, 
ORR and MRD[-]CR. Therefore, no further multivariate analysis with the additional covariates was done. 
Coadministration of daratumumab was found to have a positive effect (p < 0.05) with the efficacy 
endpoints PFS, ORR, and MRD[-]CR at 12 months. 
When combining data from all the studies in a pooled exposure response analysis of efficacy endpoints, 
the analysis did not show any statistically significant relationship between carfilzomib exposure and the 
primary efficacy endpoints, PFSand ORR. Therefore, no further multivariate analysis with the additional 
covariates was done. Coadministration of daratumumab was found to have a positive effect (p < 0.05) 
with the efficacy endpoints PFS and ORR.

exposure of carfilzomib and ischemic lung disease. only a small number of subjects had interstitial lung 
disease in CANDOR (7 of 445 subjects) and in the pooled dataset (9 out of 508). A relationship (p < 0.05) 
was also identified between coadministration of daratumumab and grade ≥ 3 adverse events.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic in the target population 
The Applicant has applied a population-based analysis to describe the time-course of daratumumab and 
carfilzomib in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The structural PK models used were 
developed for the original MAA and successfully fitted to the observed data. The modelling strategy, 
model selection and model evaluation procedures are endorsed.  
The final dataset of daratumumab consisted in 1556 samples from 375 patients. 723 samples were 
excluded. 
In relation to the PK model of daratumumab, the estimated final parameters and the included covariates 
are reasonable. They have been estimated with adequate precision and the inter-individual variability is 
moderate. The goodness-of-fit graphs show a description of the observations. Differences are more 
notable in patients with body weights less than 74 kg, in women, and in patients with albumin levels less 
than 40 g/L, where a slight under-prediction in the higher range of Ctrough and Cmax values is observed. 
In addition, the elimination of the monoclonal antibody has been described using a linear and non-linear 
mechanisms able to account for the nonspecific clearance for IgG and the saturable target-mediate 
clearance, respectively. The reduction in the maximum velocity of the saturable process has been justified 
by the presence of a target-mediated drug disposition for daratumumab affecting together the total target 
amount in patients with multiple myeloma once receiving daratumumab. No differences were detected in 
terms of efficacy due to clinically relevant changes in exposure (>20%) in patients with different type of 
myeloma, with mild hepatic impairment, weight > 85 kg and moderate renal impairment. 
The population PK model of carfilzomib was adapted from a previous publication in patients with multiple 
myeloma. Linear pharmacokinetic processes were assumed to describe the time-course of carfilzomib 
after intravenous administration. The final PK model incorporates a BSA effect on clearance. However, the 
inter-individual variability associated to each of the PK parameters (CL, Vc, Q and Vp) was considerably 
high (>95%). The justification of sparse sampling as a consequence that may limit the identification of 
covariate effects and increase the inter-individual variability of PK parameters is reasonable. 
Potential drug-drug interaction of KdD combination 
No formal investigations of the DDI potential between the components of the combination were 
performed and this could be considered acceptable. The use of dexamethasone in combination with either 
carfilzomib or daratumumab is already approved. The absence of clinically significant interaction between 
dexamethane and respectively carfilzomib and daratumumab already established.  
The absence of clinically significant interaction between dexamethane and respectively carfilzomib and 
daratumumab already established. With regard to carfilzomib and daratumumab, the elimination 
pathways for are mainly mediated by ubiquitous enzymes (non-cytochrome P450 enzymes). According to 
the applicant, the pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential is expected to be low between carfilzomib 
and daratumumab. This is supported by the rapid and extensive elimination of carfilzomib by non-
cytochrome P450 mechanisms (epoxide hydrolases, peptidases). The drug interaction potential between 
carfilzomib and daratumumab is also low based on the unlikely interactions between small molecules and 
biologics, mainly attributed to differences in each clearance mechanism. Based on the metabolic 
pathways of carfilzomib (epoxide hydrolases, peptidases). Also, Clinical pharmacokinetic assessments of 
daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, thalidomide, bortezomib and 
dexamethasone indicated no clinically-relevant drug-drug interaction between daratumumab and these 
small molecule medicinal products. Furthermore, the covariate analyses in the PPK studies, identified no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/593622/2020 
Page 41/127 
 
 
  
  
 
clinically significant intrinsic factors (eg, sex, race, disease, organ dysfunctions) or extrinsic factors (eg, 
drug-drug interactions) impacting carfilzomib or daratumumab pharmacokinetics have been identified. 
Therefore, the potential for DDI is limited and the lack of formal PK investigations is acceptable. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The evaluation of the QTc prolongation was performed using data after carfilzomib administration in 
combination with dexamethasone and daratumumab, or in combination with dexamethasone alone in 382 
patients. A joint analysis revealed the lack of any QTc prolongation. A lack of linear relationship has been 
demonstrated for each treatment arm (Kd and DKd), suggesting no clinically relevant change in QTcF due 
to the exposure of carfilzomib.  
Exposure-efficacy 
An exposure-efficacy relationship was established between trough and maximal trough concentrations of 
daratumumab and the relative hazard of disease. A significant improvement was observed when the 
exposure of daratumumab was greater than Q1. The improvement over the Kd group is minimal as long 
the exposure of daratumumab increases from Q1, indicating a saturable relationship. The Kaplan-Meir 
analysis shows a slight improvement in PFS in patients receiving DKd vs Kd group. 
No exposure-efficacy relationship was found when carfilzomib average AUC in cycle 1 was related to the 
overall response rate or MRD response. Nevertheless, the results showed a higher overall response rate 
and MRD scores for the DKd groups vs the Kd group, confirming the improvement in terms of efficacy. 
Exposure-safety 
No daratumumab exposure was available in the Kd group, which limited the comparison between Kd and 
DKd groups in terms of the exposure-safety analysis. Several inverse relationships were observed 
between daratumumab exposure and the incidence of adverse events, which do not indicate any 
exposure-safety relationship. A exposure-safety relationship was found between exposure of carfilzoib 
and ischemic lung disease, which was also observed when daratumumab is coadministered. The statistical 
relationship between carfilzomib exposure and interstitial lung disease showed limited impact in the 
number of patients with safety issues. No differences were provided in the incidence of interstitial lung 
disease between Kd and DKd groups. However, due to the limited number of patients (7 of 445) showing 
the disease, the comparison lacks clinical relevance. 
The clinical pharmacology data included in this application did not necessitate an update of the SmPC.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The population pharmacokinetic models adequately account for the daratumumab and carfilzomib 
longitudinal observations. The QTc analysis indicates the lack of any QTc prolongation when carfilzomib is 
co-administered with dexamethasone and daratumumab. The exposure-efficacy analysis shows a 
reduction in the hazard of disease for the combination group 
(carfilzomib+dexamethasone+daratumumab) compared to carfilzomib+dexamethasone.

Table 8-2. Dosing Schedule 
Justification for Investigational Product Dose 
The dose schedule in the KdD group was based on the objective of evaluating the effect of the addition of 
daratumumab to a well characterized Kd regimen. The safety and efficacy of Kd 20/56 mg/m2 twice-
weekly has been established in randomized phase 3 Study 2011-003 (ENDEAVOR; Dimopoulos et al, 
2017; Dimopoulos et al, 2016a). 
Dosing of daratumumab in subjects with multiple myeloma was 16 mg/kg (weekly for 8 weeks, then 
every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, then every 4 weeks thereafter) as per the label (see Table 8-2). The dose 
selection was based on an acceptable safety profile, maximal clinical activity, and pharmacokinetics 
consistent with saturation of the target. 
An antiviral was required concomitant medication for the duration of treatment with carfilzomib. A proton-
pump inhibitor (omeprazole or equivalent) was a required concomitant medication while taking 
dexamethasone.  
Pre- and Post-infusion Medications for Daratumumab 
On daratumumab infusion days, subjects in the KdD group received paracetamol, antihistamine, and 
leukotriene inhibitor before daratumumab infusion. 
In the absence of infusion-related adverse events after the first 3 infusions, post-infusion corticosteroids 
were administered per investigator discretion. 
For subjects with a higher risk of respiratory complications an antihistamine, leukotriene inhibitor, short-
acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist, and control medications for lung disease (eg, inhaled 
corticosteroids ± long-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonists for subjects with asthma; long-acting 
bronchodilators such as tiotropium or salmeterol ± inhaled corticosteroids for subjects with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease) were administered after daratumumab infusions.

Hypothesis 
The main hypothesis was that the carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and daratumumab (KdD) regimen would 
provide significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) over the carfilzomib and 
dexamethasone (Kd) regimen.

Sample size 
One hundred eighty-eight PFS events were required to have at least 90% power to demonstrate 
superiority at an alternative hazard ratio (HR) of 0.6 (KdD group vs Kd group), using a log rank test at 1-
sided overall significance level of 0.025. The hypothesized HR of 0.6 corresponded to an increase in 
median PFS from 18 to 30 months (Dimopoulos et al, 2016a). With 450 subjects randomized (300 in the 
KdD group vs 150 in the Kd group), it was anticipated that 188 events would be accrued at approximately 
27 months after the first subject was randomized assuming events followed an exponential distribution. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio using an IxRS to receive either KdD or Kd. Eligible 
subjects were stratified at the time of randomization based on the following stratification factors: 
1.  original ISS stage at screening (stages 1 or 2 vs stage 3) 
2.  prior proteasome inhibitor exposure (yes vs no) 
3.  number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs ≥ 2) 
4.  prior CD38 antibody therapy (yes vs no) 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. However, the assessment of response and disease progression for the 
primary analysis was determined by an IRC in a blinded manner. 
Sensitivity analyses of response and disease progression were determined centrally by the sponsor using 
a validated computer algorithm (Onyx Response Computational Assessment [ORCA]) in a blinded 
manner. 
Statistical methods 
Before the analyses for this study report were conducted, the protocol-defined statistical analyses were 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

Planned Analyses 
Summary statistics were provided for continuous variables. Frequency and percentage were summarized 
by treatment group for binary and categorical variables. Proportions and the corresponding 95% CI were 
based on Clopper-Pearson Method and the treatment comparison were based on Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test. Exact tests were considered for subgroup analyses when the cell size was considered 
small. Time-to-event endpoints were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Stratified log-rank test 
statistics and associated p-values were also calculated. Hazard ratios were estimated using stratified Cox 
proportional hazards models. 
Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Guidelines 
No interim analysis of PFS was planned or performed. The first interim analysis of OS was tested at the 
time of primary analysis of PFS 
Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis of PFS was event driven. The primary analysis, reported herein, was planned for 
when it was estimated that approximately 188 PFS events were observed. As IRC evaluations were not 
available in real time, blinded monitoring of cumulative PFS events was employed using ORCA assessed 
events to determine an initial data cutoff date for the planned primary analysis date. The primary analysis 
was to be conducted when at least 165 PFS events by IRC were observed. 
Final Analysis 
The final analysis of the study will be conducted at approximately 230 OS events or 58 months after the 
first subject was enrolled, whichever is earlier. The results of the final analysis are not provided within 
this report. 
Planned Methods of Analysis 
Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy analyses were based on the ITT Population. 
Testing of the primary and key secondary endpoints was performed using a fixed sequence hierarchical 
testing procedure in the order of PFS, ORR, MRD[-]CR rate at 12 months, and OS such that the overall 
Type I error rate was strongly controlled under 0.025 (1-sided). Overall survival was tested at a 
significance level of 0.001 for this primary analysis.

Study baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 9-5. Most subjects were enrolled in Europe 
(66.5%); subjects were also enrolled in Asia Pacific (26.4%) and North America (7.1%). 
Disease characteristics were generally balanced between the treatment groups. The percentage of 
subjects who had previously received a lenalidomide-containing regimen was lower in the KdD group 
(39.4%) than in the Kd group (48.1%). The percentage of subjects who had a prior transplant was also 
higher in the KdD group (62.5%) than in the Kd group (48.7%).

Additional Baseline Characteristics (Intent-to-Treat Population) 
Medical history was most frequently reported (> 25% of subjects) in the system organ classes (KdD, Kd) 
of vascular disorders (49.7%, 59.7%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (36.2%, 31.2%), 
nervous system disorders (29.2%, 26.6%), gastrointestinal disorders (28.8%, 29.2%), metabolism and 
nutrition disorders (29.5%, 26.6%), and surgical and medical procedures (27.2%, 25.3%). 
Eighty-two subjects (26.2%) in the KdD group and 53 subjects (34.4%) in the Kd group had an 
abnormal, baseline electrocardiogram interpretation. The median (range) left ventricular ejection fraction 
was 62.0% (41, 84) for the KdD group and 62.0% (40, 82) for the Kd group. Median (range) CrCl was 
82.80 (17.4, 291.0) mL/min for the KdD group and 80.40 (24.6, 217.8) mL/min for the Kd group at 
baseline. Most subjects in the KdD group (56.4%) and Kd group (50.0%) had a CrCl level ≥ 80 mL/min. 
A history of hypertension was noted at baseline for 135 subjects (43.3%) in the KdD group and 84 
subjects (54.5%) in the Kd group. 
Overall, 74 subjects (23.7%) in the KdD group and 70 subjects (45.5%) in the Kd group had at least 1 
antimyeloma therapy after discontinuation of study treatment. The most frequent antimyeloma 
medications (> 10% of subjects in either group) were (Kd, KdD): dexamethasone (25.3%, 14.1%,), 
lenalidomide (16.2%, 10.9%), and daratumumab (15.6%, 1.3%).

Overall Survival 
As of the data cutoff (14 July 2019), 59 subjects (18.9%) in the KdD group and 36 subjects (23.4%) in 
the Kd group had died (see table below). 
Overall survival data were not mature and median OS was not reached in either treatment group by the 
data cutoff date (see table below). The HR for OS was 0.745 (95% CI: 0.491, 1.131; p = 0.0836). The 
OS distribution is shown in the Kaplan-Meier plot in Figure 10-5. The OS event-free rate was 84.5% in 
the KdD group and 85.2% in the Kd group at 12 months and 79.9% in the KdD group and 74.4% in the 
Kd group at 18 months (see table below). Median follow-up time was 17.2 months in the KdD group and 
17.1 months in the Kd group.

Time to Progression 
The HR (95% CI) for time to progression as assessed by IRC was 0.506 (0.363, 0.707). The median 
(95% CI) time to progression was not estimable for the KdD group and was 17.5 (13.2, NE) months for 
the Kd group. 
Time to Progression as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (ITT Population) 
Time to Response 
The median (min, max) time to overall response was 1.0 (1, 14) months for the KdD group and 1.0 (1, 
10) for the Kd group. 
Persistence of MRD[-]CR 
The sustained MRD[-]CR rate data were not mature as of the data cutoff. The sustained MRD[-]CR rate 
(95% CI) as assessed by IRC was 0.0 (0.0, 2.4) for the KdD group and 0.0 (0.0, 1.2) for the Kd group. 
Complete Response Rate 
The complete response rate (95% CI) as assessed by IRC was 28.5% (23.6, 33.9) for the KdD group and 
10.4% (6.1, 16.3) for the Kd group (odds ratio: 3.507 [95% CI:1.971, 6.238). For subjects who achieved 
CR, median (min, max) time to CR was 8.4 (2, 16) months for the KdD group and 7.0 (3, 14) months for 
the Kd group. 
MRD[-] Rate 
The MRD[-] rate at 12 months (at a 10-5 level) was 17.6% (95% CI: 13.6, 22.3) in the KdD group and 
3.9% (95% CI: 1.4, 8.3) in the Kd group (odds ratio: 5.762 [95% CI: 2.375, 13.979]). 
Quality of Life 
Completion rates for all expected subjects (ie, randomized subjects who were still on study treatment at 
that visit) were > 81% for both treatment groups from baseline through cycle 26, with median 5.26% 
and 12.13% for extent of missingness across all visits for QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL data for the KdD and Kd 
groups, respectively. The primary analysis using a restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed effects 
model for repeated measures analysis under the assumption of missing at random, showed no

statistically significant KdD treatment improvement in overall or by visit. The overall treatment difference 
(KdD – Kd) (SE; 95% CI) over time in change from baseline QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL values was 0.06 (1.24; -
2.39, 2.50). The sensitivity analysis based on a pattern mixture model using a grouping variable to 
account for the missingness pattern provided similar results to the primary analysis. The overall 
treatment difference (KdD – Kd) (SE; 95% CI) in change from baseline QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL values for 
early dropout, middle dropout, and late dropout were -2.78 (2.27; -7.24, 1.69), 0.23 (1.97; -3.65, 4.10), 
and 1.12 (2.28; -3.36, 5.61), respectively. Results were generally consistent across subgroups. 
Cumulative distribution frequency graphs of changes from baseline by study group at each visit were 
plotted showing a positive benefit in the KdD arm compared to the Kd arm at selected visits. Similar 
findings were observed in the responder analysis and ANCOVA analysis.

Notes 
Randomization was stratified by the original International Staging System stage at study 
entry (stages 1 or 2 versus stage 3), prior proteasome inhibitor exposure (yes versus no), 
number of prior lines of therapy (1 versus ≥ 2), and prior CD38 inhibitor exposure (yes 
versus no).   
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The CANDOR study was designed to allow the recruitment of patients with MM previously treated with at 
least one prior line (transplant is considered as 1 line of therapy) but not more than three. Patients were 
2:1 randomized to KdD and Kd arms, using as stratification factors: original ISS stage, lines of therapy, 
prior PI exposure and prior CD38 Ab exposure. Prior therapy with carfilzomib and anti-CD38 antibodies 
were allowed as previous treatment, provided at least PR was obtained and there was a treatment-free 
interval of 6 months. Patients refractory to any prior lenalidomide treatment and any prior PI-including 
regimen were allowed.  
Subjects in both arms received dexamethasone (40 mg/weekly) plus carfilzomib 20 mg/m2 IV over 30 
minutes on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1, followed by escalation to 56 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on days 8, 9, 
15, and 16 of cycle 1. Subjects who tolerated 56 mg/m2 in cycle 1 were kept at this dose for each 
subsequent 28 day cycle until disease progression, intolerable side effects, withdrawal of consent or 
death. The same posology authorized in combination with dexamethasone based on ENDEAVOR study. In 
the KdD arm, daratumumab was added as 16 mg/Kg IV infusion (weekly for 8 weeks, then every 2 weeks 
for 16 weeks and then every 4 weeks for the remaining cycles or until disease progression) as per the 
SmPC. 
According to the MAH, the rational for the selected dose of 56 mg/m2 twice-weekly was related to the 
available mature safety long-term data for Kd from the ENDEAVOR study. This, combined with the fact 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/593622/2020 
Page 80/127 
 
 
  
  
 
 
that at the time of the study design daratumumab had been safely added to a series of established 
standard of care myeloma back bone therapies, including triplets containing a proteasome inhibitor 
(DVMP, DVd), resulted in the use of this dose regimen for carfilzomib in this study.  
PFS was the primary endpoint, with ORR, MRD(-)CR and OS as key secondary endpoints. PFS is defined 
as time from randomization until disease progression or death from any cause. Disease progression was 
determined by a blinded Independent Review Committee (IRC), based on IMWG-URC (Kumar, 2016) 
criteria. The use of PFS as main outcome variable is acceptable, given that there are different efficacious 
treatment alternatives that patients could receive, which will likely modify the expected survival. Although 
the design of the study is unblinded, the use of an IRC to assess response (as defined by IMWG-URC) is 
endorsed. In addition, the different sensitivity analyses planned increase the level of robustness of the 
results.  
Regarding the amendment 1 - updated and clarified the IMWG-URC, during the time this modification was 
in effect, 101 subjected were enrolled, but, according to the MAH, none of the patients were assessed 
with the previous IMWG-URC version, as the analyses took place after the date of this amendment 1. 
Amendment 4 – added 2 interim readouts of OS at 36 and 48 months after the first subject enrolled, as 
well as, methods for the analyses and clarification of the timing of the OS final analysis. This amendment 
seems to be conducted before database snapshot for the primary analysis. Thus, this issue is not further 
pursued. 
The applicant was requested to provide further details on important protocol deviation “Entered study 
even though entry criteria were not satisfied” and “Missing data (other than TA or TC)”. Patients with 
missing data (other than TA or TC) were classified as important protocol deviations following strictly the 
protocol deviation handling plan (50 patients). Overall, the efficacy results on the ITT population were 
consistent with the per protocol population analysis so these deviations seemed to have had no impact on 
the study results. The “entered study even though entry criteria were not satisfied” category was applied 
for failure to adhere to the CANDOR study inclusion/exclusion criteria detected in the 21-day window 
between enrolment and randomization. This happened in 39 patients and details were provided showing 
no effect on the efficacy analyses. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 466 subjects were randomized (312 subjects in the KdD group and 154 subjects in the Kd 
group). As of the data cutoff of 14 July 2019, 129 subjects (41.3%) in the KdD group and 46 subjects 
(29.9%) in the Kd group were continuing carfilzomib. One hundred and three patients were screened but 
not randomized as per study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Additionally, 3 patients were randomized but not 
dosed due to worsening of their condition before starting treatment, which was recorded as ‘sponsor 
reasons’. 
The population recruited in the study is the one expected at relapse. The median age of 64 is similar to 
that in other phase 3 studies in relapsed MM patients. The study enrolled 43 subjects (9.2%) above 75 
years and no one ≥ 85 years. Pointing out that the percentage of subjects aged 75 to 84 years was lower 
in the KdD group (9.0%) than in the Kd group (14.3%). The majority geographic region is Europe 
(66.5%).  
Around half of patients received previous transplant (48.7% in Kd vs 62.5% in KdD), most of them 
autologous. Patients with at least 2 previous regimens were 77%. Most patients received PI-including 
regimen (92.1%; 90.3% in Kd and 92.9% in KdD). However, only 1 patient in KdD arm received previous 
CD38 therapy. This information is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Lenalidomide was administered to 
42.3%, with slightly differences between arms (48.1% in Kd and 39.4% in KdD). IMiD was administered

to 67.8%, with slightly differences between arms (71.4% in Kd and 66.0% in KdD). The potential impact 
on the results of this study of these unbalances on lenalidomide and IMiD prior treatment was discussed 
and efficacy endpoints were adjusted for this covariate, showing no differences between both treatment 
arms. Approximately 34% of patients were refractory to any prior PI-including regimen (35.7% in Kd vs 
32.7% in KdD), 33% to any prior lenalidomide-including regimen (35.7% in Kd vs 31.7%in KdD) and 
41.8 % to any prior IMiD-including regimen (42.2% in Kd vs 41.7%in KdD).  
It should be noted that, according to Multiple Myeloma ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, 
treatment and follow-up, association of Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone (Kd) is one of the standards of 
care at relapse after an IMiD-based induction. However, an IMiD based induction treatment was not part 
of the inclusion criteria. The MAH noted that the inclusion criteria for the CANDOR study were defined 
before the publication of the current version of the ESMO Guidelines and were based on those used in the 
ENDEAVOR study (which led to the marketing authorization of Kd 20/56 mg/m2 twice-weekly), to ensure 
that the control group enrolled in CANDOR was similar to the indicated population in the different regions.  
The majority of patients had prior IMiD exposure before entering the CANDOR study. The benefit of KdD 
in patients exposed to prior IMiDs is acknowledged. 
Regarding medical history pointing out the following slightly unbalances between arms (Kd, KdD): 
vascular disorders (59.7%, 49.7%), an abnormal baseline electrocardiogram interpretation (34.4%, 
26.2%), baseline history of hypertension (54.5%, 43.3%). These unbalances could have impact on safety 
finding. 
Regarding the best overall response to last prior systemic therapy and refractory to the last prior line of 
therapy, an unbalance in favour of KdD arm is observed (sCR+CR+VGPR: 40.9% in Kd, 51.3% in KdD; 
refractory to last prior line therapy: 61.7% in Kd, 52.9% in KdD), which could suggest that patients 
included in the KdD could have better prognostic factors. The MAH provided additional results for PFS HR 
adjusting for these 2 baseline covariates (best overall response [BOR] of very good partial response 
[VGPR] or better to the last prior therapy, or refractoriness to the last prior therapy) which were 
consistent with the PFS results from the main analysis in the ITT population. Although these results, as 
obtained from post-hoc analysis, should be taken with caution, it seems that these unbalances maynot 
have had an impact on the study results. 
Overall, 74 subjects (23.7%) in the KdD group and 70 subjects (45.5%) in the Kd group had at least 1 
antimyeloma therapy after discontinuation of study treatment. As expected, most of new antimyeloma 
therapies were administered more frequently in the Kd arm, being daratumumab (1.3%, 15.6%) and 
dexamethasone (14.1%, 25.3%) the most frequent ones. Only the following new antimyeloma therapy 
were administered with slightly higher frequency in the KdD arm (Kd, KdD): cyclophosphamide (5.2%, 
6.1%), ixazomib (1.3%, 1.9%), dexamethasone with lenalidomide (0.6%, 1.9%), elotuzumab (1.3%, 
1.6%). 
A statistically significant difference was observed for PFS (as assessed by the IRC) between the KdD and 
Kd groups (HR = 0.630; 95% CI: 0.464, 0.854; p = 0.0014) in the final PFS analysis. The median PFS 
was 15.8 months (95% CI: 12.1, not estimable [NE]) in the Kd arm, while median PFS was not reached 
in the KdD arm. Highlighted that the median PFS is slightly lower than that observed for Kd in the 
ENDEAVOR study (18.7 months) and slightly lower than it was expected in the calculation of sample size. 
This could be in relation with data on the best response to last prior systemic regimen (sCR+CR+VGPR; 
47% in ENDEAVOR study for Kd) and refractory to last prior systemic therapy (39.7% in ENDEAVOR 
study for Kd) (see data of this study above). This result seems robust as the different sensitive analyses 
(investigator and ORCA among others) offer similar results. Results for PFS were consistent in the PP 
population. As median PFS was not reached for KdD arm. No formal PFS additional analyses were 
planned. Updated data for PFS, based on ORCA, using a data cutoff date of 15 June 2020 were provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/593622/2020

Results showed that improvement of PFS was maintained, HR = 0.590; 95% CI: 0.449, 0.776; p < 
0.0001.  Median PFS was 28.6 months in the KdD arm and 15.2 months in the Kd arm. 
It is not proven that this delay in the progression of MM can be translated into a longer survival, since OS 
data are not mature. In this regard the first OS interim analysis (IA) offered a positive trend for KdD vs 
Kd (0.745 (95% CI: 0.491, 1.131; p = 0.0836). The OS event-free rate was 84.5% in the KdD group and 
85.2% in the Kd group at 12 months and 79.9% in the KdD group and 74.4% in the Kd group at 18 
months. The MAH provided results of the second OS IA using a data cutoff date of 15 june 2020. OS data 
were still not mature (28.5 events in the KdD group and 33.1 events in the Kd group) and statistical 
significance was not reached since the p value did not cross the prespecified 0.004 boundary, but a 
positive trend was noted: HR = 0.758; 95% CI: 0.536, 1.073; p = 0.0590 (data still not mature). 
Another IA for OS and final analysis for OS are planned. Results of this 3rd IA and the final analysis are 
expected by 2nd quarter 2021 and 2nd quarter 2022, respectively. Results of these additional OS 
analyses will be provided once available. 
The other secondary key variables ORR and MRD(-)CR at 12 months (at a 10-5 level) according to IRC 
support the PFS results. The ORR as assessed by IRC was 84.3% (95% CI: 79.8, 88.1) in the KdD group 
and 74.7% (95% CI: 67.0, 81.3) in the Kd group (odds ratio: 1.925 [95% CI: 1.184, 3.129]; p = 
0.0040). The MRD[-]CR rate at 12 months (at a 10-5 level) based on IRC assessment was 12.5% (95% 
CI: 9.0, 16.7) in the KdD group and 1.3% (95% CI: 0.2, 4.6) in the Kd group (odds ratio: 11.329 [95% 
CI: 2.703, 47.476]; p < 0.0001). The sensitive analyses (investigator and ORCA among others) for ORR 
and MRD(-)CR offer similar results. Additional secondary endpoints (DoR, time to next treatment) are 
overall in line with PFS. The updated data (cutoff data of 15 June 2020) for secondary endpoints confirm 
results observed in the primary analysis.  
PFS results are highly contrasted between subgroups of particular interest. Indeed, only a non-
statistically significant positive trend was observed for the European population subgroup (HR= 0.857 
[95% CI: 0.596 - 1.231], 66% of the subjects) whereas results are highly statistically significant for the 
North-America region (HR= 0.041 [95% CI=0.005; 0.339], 7% of the subjects). Baseline disease 
characteristics were further analyzed in both subgroups (Europe and North-America regions) to explore if 
a worse disease stage or refractoriness to previous treatments could have impacted PFS results but no 
particular trend was observed to clearly explain this difference. Of note, even if these results per region 
are somehow unexpected, the small size of the subgroup precludes any conclusion. Further, region was 
not a stratification factor in the study and there is no obvious justification, either from a biological 
plausibility perspective (based on clinical, pharmacological, and mechanistic considerations) or after 
consideration of data from other trials with carflizomib (e.g. ASPIRE, ENDEAVOR), to support that the 
treatment effect should not be consistent among European and North American patients.  
Overall, the PFS benefit of KdD was consistently observed in most subgroups, although there are several 
subgroups with categories crossing 1, most cases due to limited number of patients included in those 
categories. Pointing out among those cases, those with HR >1: patients ≥ 75 years of age (n = 43; PFS 
HR 1.459 95% CI [0.504, 4.223]), revised ISS stage at baseline- stage 3 (n=39; PFS HR 1.348 95%CI 
[0.538, 3.381]) and presence of soft tissue plasmacytoma at baseline (n=23; PFS HR 1.560 95%CI 
[0.531, 4.580]). It should be also highlighting that among stratification factors, for subgroup of 1 prior 
line of therapy the benefit is less clear (PFS HR 0.701 95%CI [0.418, 1.174]). Subgroups of interest that 
showed the superiority of the new combination (KdD) for PFS: prior bortezomib or ixazomib treatment 
(PFS HR 0.643 95%CI [0.470, 0.879]), prior lenalidomide (PFS HR 0.521 95%CI [0.339, 0.802]), 
refractory to lenalidomide (PFS HR 0.453 95%CI [0.279, 0.737]), prior IMiD (PFS HR 0.622 95%CI 
[0.439, 0.883]) and refractory to IMiD (PFS HR 0.448 95%CI [0.290, 0.694]). However, in one potential 
population for this combination, patients refractory to bortezomib or ixazomib, the benefit is less clear 
(PFS HR 0.871 95%CI [0.540, 1.405]).  
Assessment report

The number of subjects with any subsequent anti-myeloma therapy use was respectively 70 (45.5%) and 
74 (23.7%) in Kd and KdD arms, twice less frequent in KdD arm. Thus, the MAH was asked to provide 
Progression Free Survival to the subsequent anti-myeloma therapy (PFS2) data. The median (95% CI) 
PFS2 was not estimable for the KdD group and of 33.2 months (33.2, not estimable) for the Kd group. 
The PFS2 event-free rate at 24 months was 72.5% in the KdD group and 65.1% for the Kd group. As the 
design of the study did not include the PFS2 assessment and these were provided upon request during 
the assessment, these data should be interpreted with caution.  
In the ORR subgroups analysis, there are several subgroups containing 1 in their 95% CI, although all of 
them showed odds ratio > 1. Regarding stratification factors, all subgroups contain 1 in their 95% CI, 
except prior proteasome inhibition (yes) and ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy. Pointing out that results observed 
on subgroups of interest that showed the superiority of the new combination (KdD) for PFS are not fully 
consistent with results for ORR in the following cases: prior lenalidomide (ORR Odds ratio= 1.289 
[95%CI: 0.654, 2.538]), refractory to lenalidomide (ORR Odds ratio= 1.481[95%CI: 0.686, 3.199]) and 
refractory to IMiD (ORR Odds ratio=1.691 [95%CI: 0.839, 3.410]). 
In MRD(-)CR subgroups analysis, the benefit for KdD was consistently seen in most subgroups. All 
showed odds ratio > 1, with 95% CI excluding 1, with exception of patients > 75 years, Asian, Asian 
Pacific region, refractory to bortezomib or ixazomib and no prior IMiD exposure. 
Subgroups analyses in the three endpoints suggest that benefit in patients > 75 and refractory to 
bortezomib and ixazomib is less clear. A total of 43 patients above 75 years of age were enrolled and it 
should be kept in mind that the percentage of subjects aged 75 to 84 years was lower in the KdD group 
(9.0%) than in the Kd group (14.3%) and no patients ≥ 85 years have been included in this study. It is 
considered that the small size of the subgroup of patients over 75 years of age precludes any firm 
conclusion.. KdD should be used with caution in patients ≥75 years after careful consideration of the 
potential benefit/risk on an individual basis (see section 5.1 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
A pre-planned interim OS analysis was performed approximately 36 months after first subject enrolled. 
The median follow-up was approximately 28 months. Current OS data are not mature. The first OS 
interim analysis offered a positive trend for KdD vs Kd (HR 0.745 (95% CI: 0.491, 1.131; p = 0.0836). 
The OS event-free rate was 84.5% in the KdD group and 85.2% in the Kd group at 12 months and 79.9% 
in the KdD group and 74.4% in the Kd group at 18 months. Results from a second IA were overall 
consistent with the first IA. A trend in favour of KdD was observed although statistical significance was 
not reached (HR 0.758; 95% CI: 0.536, 1.073; p = 0.0590). Data from a third IA for OS and the final 
analysis will not be available before the MA is granted. Thus, the MAH will provide them as a post-
authorisation measure. 
Overall survival data were not mature at the time of the analysis, and while, a trend toward longer OS in 
the KdD arm compared with Kd armin the overall population and even in elderly patients for OS could be 
observed, according to the KM curves there was a higher rate of deaths in elderly patients treated with 
KdD compared with those receiving Kd during (approximately) the first year of treatment. This could be 
related to the higher rate of fatal adverse events reported in subjects ≥ 65 years of age (see clinical 
safety discussion and SmPC section 4.8).  All available efficacy results have been adequately reflected in 
the updated SmPC section 5.1.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The superiority of the new combination of carfilzomib plus dexamethasone plus daratumumab (KdD) vs. 
carfilzomib plus dexamethasone (Kd) has been shown in terms of improved PFS and improved depth of 
response. OS results showed an apparently significant benefit for those patients treated with KdD. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data submitted is based on the results from the phase 3, randomized Study 20160275 (hereafter 
referred to as CANDOR) of carfilzomib in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone (KdD) 
versus carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone (Kd) in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma who had received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy. 
The primary analysis of safety is a within-study comparison of the safety profile for subjects receiving 
KdD versus Kd intended to identify any meaningful imbalances between treatment groups in CANDOR, 
with 14 July 2019 as cutoff date for this analysis. 
Carfilzomib has been authorized in the EU, at 20/27 mg/m2 twice-weekly dosing, in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone and, at 20/56 mg/m2 twice-weekly, in combination with 
dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.   
As of 17 October 2019, an estimated 4202 subjects had been treated with carfilzomib for 3752.0 subject-
years of exposure as participants in 26 company-sponsored clinical studies (20 completed and 6 ongoing) 
and an estimated 139 006 patients had received carfilzomib for 53 878 patient-years of exposure in the 
postmarketing setting. Updated data submitted showed that, as of 19 January 2020, an estimated 4297 
subjects had been treated with carfilzomib for 3823.5 subject-years of exposure as participants in 27 
company-sponsored clinical studies (20 completed and 7 ongoing) and an estimated 149785 patients had 
received carfilzomib for 58 056 patient-years of exposure in the marketed setting. 
Based on 1 676 445 500 milligrams distributed from launch to 31 October 2019, the estimated exposure 
to daratumumab is 63 675 person-years in the postmarketing setting. 
Patient exposure 
In the CANDOR study, 461 subjects were treated with at least 1 dose of investigational product 
(308 subjects in the KdD group and 153 subjects in the Kd group) and comprise the safety population. 
The median treatment duration for any investigational product (carfilzomib, daratumumab, or 
dexamethasone) was longer for the KdD group (70.1 weeks) than the Kd group (40.3 weeks). As for the 
new safety data cutoff (Jan 2020), when compared with the CANDOR primary analysis, the median 
treatment duration for any investigational product was 9.2 weeks longer for the KdD group, but remained 
unchanged for the Kd group 
Given the difference in the treatment exposure in each group, exposure-adjusted risk estimates are 
presented along the data provided to identify if the observed imbalance in incidence may be related to 
duration of treatment.  The risk estimate presented is the number of events per 100 subject-years.

As of the data cutoff (14 July 2019), subjects received a median of 58.36 weeks of treatment with 
carfilzomib in the KdD group and 40.29 weeks in the Kd group (Table 1). As for number of cycles, 
patients in KdD arm received a median of 15 cycles (Min, Max: 1, 26) and subjects from Kd arm received 
a median of 11 cycles (1, 25). The median relative dose intensity of carfilzomib was 90.80% in the KdD 
group and 93.29% in the Kd group. Upon the updated safety data, subjects received a median of 61.1 
weeks of treatment with carfilzomib in the KdD group and 40.3 weeks in the Kd group (Table 1). When 
compared with the CANDOR primary analysis, the median treatment duration for carfilzomib was 2.7 
weeks longer for the KdDgroup but unchanged for the Kd group.

Exposure to Daratumumab 
In the KdD group, subjects received a median of 68.14 weeks of treatment with daratumumab (Table 1), 
which was translated into a median of 17 cycles (Min, Max: 1, 26).  The median relative dose intensity of 
daratumumab was 95.61%. For the updated safety data analyses, compared with the CANDOR primary

analysis, in the KdD group, subjects received a median of 79.2 weeks of treatment with daratumumab, 
an increase of 11.1 weeks from the primary analysis. 
Adverse events 
In CANDOR, 306 subjects (99.4%) in the KdD group and 147 subjects (96.1%) in the Kd group had at 
least 1 adverse event. A higher subject incidence in the KdD group compared with the Kd group was 
reported (KdD, Kd) for grade ≥ 3 adverse events (82.1%, 73.9%), serious adverse events (56.2%, 45.8%), 
and fatal adverse events (9.7%, 5.2%).  A similar subject incidence in the KdD group and the Kd group 
was reported for adverse events that led to the discontinuation of carfilzomib (KdD:  21.1%, Kd:  21.6%). 
An overview of the adverse events is provided below. 
Table 6 .  Overview of Adverse Events (Safety Population) 
After adjusting for exposure, the risk estimate (95% CI) of adverse events was higher in the KdD group 
compared with the Kd group (1308.74 [1170.02, 1463.91] versus 831.53 [707.41, 977.42]; per 
100 subject-years, respectively).  Exposure-adjusted risk estimates for serious adverse events were 
similar at 75.89 and 73.35 in the KdD group and the Kd group, respectively. This suggests that the higher 
crude incidence of serious adverse events in the KdD group may be because of longer treatment.

Table 7. Overview of Exposure-adjusted Rate of Adverse Events (Safety Population) 
Consistent with the CANDOR primary analysis, along the updated safety data, a higher incidence in the 
KdD group compared with the Kd group was reported (KdD, Kd) for grade ≥ 3 adverse events (84.7%, 
74.5%), serious adverse events (61.0%, 47.1%), and fatal adverse events (9.7%, 5.2%) (Table 3). No 
new fatal adverse events were reported since the CANDOR primary analysis. 
Compared with the CANDOR primary analysis, a higher incidence in the KdD group (23.4%) compared 
with the Kd group (21.6%) was also reported for adverse events that led to the discontinuation of 
carfilzomib. 
Common Adverse Events  
Adverse events by system organ class (SOC) that occurred with a ≥ 10% higher subject incidence in the 
KdD group compared with the Kd group were gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations, 
general disorders and administration site conditions, and nervous system disorders (Table 4). No adverse 
events by SOC occurred more frequently (≥ 10% difference) in the Kd group compared with the KdD 
group.  
Adverse events by preferred term that occurred with a ≥ 5% higher subject incidence in the KdD group 
compared with the Kd group (KdD, Kd) were thrombocytopenia (37.3%, 29.4%), diarrhea (31.5%, 
14.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (29.2%, 22.9%), fatigue (24.4%, 18.3%), nausea (18.2%, 
13.1%), pneumonia (17.9%, 12.4%), insomnia (17.9%, 11.1%), bronchitis (16.9%, 11.8%), back pain 
(16.2%, 9.8%), infusion-related reaction (7.8%, 2.0%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (6.5%, 
1.3%). No adverse events occurred with a ≥ 5% higher subject incidence in the Kd group than in the KdD 
group.

Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any adverse event with an onset after the administration of the first 
dose and within 30 days of the last dose of any investigational product.  Adverse events were coded using MedDRA 
(version 22.0). 
Source:  Table 14-6.2.2 of Study 20160275 
Regarding the updated safety data and, consistent with the CANDOR primary analysis, adverse events by 
system organ class (SOC) that occurred with a ≥ 10% higher subject incidence in the KdD group 
compared with the Kd group included infections and infestations (84.1%, 68.6%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (57.8%, 35.9%), and nervous system disorders (42.5%, 30.1%) . Compared with the CANDOR 
primary analysis, general disorders and administration site conditions no longer had a ≥ 10% higher

Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were reported for a higher incidence of subjects in the KdD group (82.1%) 
compared with the Kd group (73.9%). After adjusting for exposure, the risk estimate (95% CI) of grade 
≥ 3 adverse events remained higher in the KdD group compared with the Kd group (195.83 and 172.47; 
per 100 subject-years, respectively).  
Grade ≥ 3 adverse events of the SOC of infections and infestations occurred more frequently (≥ 5% 
difference in subject incidence) in the KdD group (37.3%) compared with the Kd group (29.4%) 
(exposure-adjusted rates of 43.37 and 40.35; per 100 subject-years, respectively) (Table 5). No grade ≥ 
3 adverse events by SOC occurred more frequently (≥ 5% difference) in the Kd group compared with the 
KdD group.  
Grade ≥ 3 adverse events that occurred with a ≥ 2% higher subject incidence in the KdD group 
compared with the Kd group (KdD, Kd) were thrombocytopenia (24.4%, 16.3%), anemia (16.6%, 
14.4%), neutropenia (8.4%, 5.9%), pneumonia (13.3%, 8.5%), sepsis (3.9%, 1.3%), influenza (3.6%, 
0.7%), hypertension (17.5%, 13.1%), fatigue (7.8%, 4.6%), and diarrhea (3.9%, 0.7%). Grade ≥ 3 
adverse events that occurred with a ≥ 2% higher subject incidence in the Kd group than in the KdD group 
(KdD, Kd) were cardiac failure (1.6%, 3.3%), pulmonary embolism (1.6%, 3.9%), and acute kidney 
injury (2.3%, 4.6%).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Serious adverse events were reported for a higher incidence of subjects in the KdD group (56.2%) 
compared with the Kd group (45.8%) . After adjusting for exposure, the risk estimate (95% CI) of serious 
adverse events was similar in the KdD group compared with the Kd group (75.89 [65.38, 88.08] versus 
73.35 [58.03, 92.72] per 100 subject-years, respectively).  
Consistent with the CANDOR primary analysis, serious adverse events occurred at a higher subject 
incidence in the KdD group (61.0%) compared with the Kd group (47.1%). After adjusting for exposure, 
the risk estimate of serious adverse events remained higher in the KdD group (70.71 [95% CI: 61.29, 
81.57] per 100 subject-years) compared with the Kd group (65.94 [95% CI: 52.34, 83.08] per 100 
subject-years). 
Serious adverse events of the SOCs with a ≥ 2% difference in the KdD group compared with the Kd group 
(KdD, Kd) were infections and infestations (29.5%, 24.8%) and general disorders and administration site 
conditions (7.5%, 3.9%). 
Serious adverse events of the SOCs with a ≥ 2% difference in the Kd group compared with the KdD group 
(KdD, Kd) were renal and urinary disorders (2.6%, 6.5%) and vascular disorders (1.6%, 3.9%).

Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any adverse event with an onset after the administration of the first 
dose and within 30 days of the last dose of any investigational product.  Adverse events were coded using MedDRA 
(version 22.0). 
Source:  Table 14-6.5.2 of Study 20160275 
Deaths 
Fatal adverse events were reported for a higher incidence of subjects in the KdD group (9.7%) compared 
with the Kd group (5.2%) (Table 11). At the new safety data cutoff, no additional subjects in either the 
KdD group or the Kd group had a fatal adverse event 
Fatal adverse events of the SOCs with a ≥ 1% difference in the KdD group compared with the Kd group 
(KdD, Kd) were infections and infestations (4.5%, 2.6%) and cardiac disorders (1.3%, 0.0%) (Table 11).  
No fatal adverse events by SOC occurred more frequently (≥ 1% difference) in the Kd group compared 
with the KdD group. 
The only fatal adverse event that occurred with a ≥ 1% higher subject incidence in the KdD group 
compared with the Kd group was pneumonia (KdD:  1.3%, Kd:  0.0%) (Table 7).No fatal adverse events 
occurred with a ≥ 1% higher subject incidence in the Kd group than in the KdD group. 
For the reported events of death and sudden death, in the KdD group no clear etiology (eg, infections, 
cardiac disease, or disease progression) was identified.  For the reported events from the SOC cardiac 
disorders, no other cardiac cause (eg, myocardial infarction or cardiac arrythmia) was identified. 
Events from the SOC infections and infestations accounted for most fatal adverse events in the KdD group 
and included septic shock (5 subjects [1.6%]), pneumonia (4 subjects [1.3%]), and sepsis (3 subjects 
[1.0%]) (Table 11). 
In the Kd group, infections accounted for the largest group of fatal adverse events and included sepsis 
(2 subjects [1.3%]), septic shock (1 subject [0.7%]), and influenza (1 subject [0.7%]) (Table 11).  For the 
2 cases of sepsis, there was no direct evidence of infection in 1 case as no cultures were taken and the 
etiology of the sepsis in the other case was chronic renal failure.  For the 1 case of septic shock, lung 
infection appeared to be the primary source of infection (ie, infectious pneumonitis/pneumopathy).  For 
the 1 case of influenza, the subject developed respiratory tract infection and was later diagnosed with 
influenza A virus infection.

of subjects in the ≥ 65 years subgroup had a fatal adverse event compared with 6.2% of subjects in the 
< 65 years group.  By comparison, in the Kd group, 2.6% of subjects in the ≥ 65 years subgroup had a 
fatal adverse event compared with 7.8% of subjects in the < 65 years group.  This data suggests that 
among subjects ≥ 65 years, the risk of a fatal adverse event was higher in subjects treated with KdD 
compared with Kd.  Among subjects < 65 years, the risk of a fatal adverse event was similar in the KdD 
and Kd groups.  Of note, in the ITT population, the proportion of subjects ≥ 65 years was similar in the 
KdD (47.8%) and Kd (50.0%) groups, indicating that the observed imbalance in fatal adverse events in 
subjects ≥ 65 years was not because of an imbalance at time of study entry. 
In the KdD group, 14.3% of subjects in the ≥ 75 years subgroup had a fatal adverse event compared with 
9.3% of subjects in the < 75 years subgroup (Table 12).  By comparison, in the Kd group, 0.0% of 
subjects in the ≥ 75 years subgroup had a fatal adverse event compared with 6.1% of subjects in the 
< 75 years subgroup.  This data suggests that among subjects ≥ 75 years, the risk of a fatal adverse 
event was higher in subjects treated with KdD compared with Kd; however, the absolute number of fatal 
events among subjects ≥ 75 years was 4 and thus there is inherent uncertainty regarding any inferences 
that can be made based on the small number of events.  Among subjects < 75 years, the risk of a fatal 
adverse event was higher in the KdD group (9.3%) compared with the Kd group (6.1%).  Of note, in the 
ITT population, the proportion of subjects ≥ 75 years was similar in the KdD (11.7%) and Kd (8.0%) 
groups, indicating that the observed imbalance in fatal adverse events in subjects ≥ 75 years was not 
because of an imbalance at time of study entry. 
Table 12. Subgroup Analysis of Fatal Adverse Events by Age (Safety Population) 
Of the subjects with a fatal adverse event, a lower proportion of subjects in the KdD group (46.7%) 
compared with the Kd group (75.0%) had a frailty status of fit at baseline.  A higher proportion of 
subjects in the KdD group (33.3%) compared with the Kd group (12.5%) had a frailty status of 
intermediate fitness.  Of note, in the ITT population, a higher proportion of subjects in the KdD group 
(56.4%) compared with the Kd group (44.2%) had a frailty status of fit at baseline.  A lower proportion of 
subjects in the KdD group (17.3%) compared with the Kd group (23.4%) had a frailty status of 
intermediate fitness at baseline. 
Subgroup analyses by derived frailty status are provided in Table 13  Frailty status was derived as a 
composite of the age, functional status, and comorbidities.  Among subjects with a frailty status of fit, the 
proportion of subjects who had a fatal adverse event was similar in the KdD group (7.9%) compared with 
the Kd group (3.8%).  Among subjects having a frailty status of intermediate, a higher proportion of 
subjects in the KdD group (29.4%) had a fatal adverse event compared with the Kd group (0.0%). 
Among subjects with a frailty status of intermediate, the proportion of subjects who had a fatal adverse 
event was similar in the KdD group (8.0%) compared with the Kd group (8.8%).  Among subjects having a

frailty status of intermediate, a higher proportion of subjects in the KdD group (18.9%) had a fatal 
adverse event compared with the Kd group (2.9%). 
Table 13. Overview of Adverse Events by Frailty Status Derived (Fit, Intermediate, and Frail) 
(Safety Population) 
Given the comorbidities are included as a component of frailty status, comorbidities among subjects with 
a fatal adverse event, by treatment group, are provided in Table 10.  Comorbidities were assessed using 
the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (adapted from Lonial and Nooka, 2016 and Palumbo et al, 2015).  
Among subjects with a fatal adverse event, a higher proportion of subjects in the KdD group (17 subjects 
[56.7%]) compared with the Kd group (0 subjects) had baseline comorbidities per the CCI.  Per protocol, 
the CCI should only have been assessed among subjects ≥ 65 years.  In the KdD group, 20 of 30 subjects 
with fatal adverse events were ≥ 65 years and would have had the CCI assessed.  In contrast, in the Kd 
group, 2 of 8 subjects with a fatal adverse event were ≥ 65 years and would have had the CCI assessed.  
Thus, the higher proportion of comorbidities as assessed by the CCI in the KdD group may reflect the 
larger proportion of subjects with fatal adverse events who were ≥ 65 years, rather than a true imbalance 
in baseline comorbidities.

Table 14. Fatal Adverse Events by Charlson Comorbidity Index Category (Safety Population: 
Subjects with Fatal Adverse Events) 
The median (range) time from initial diagnosis to randomization for subjects with a fatal adverse event 
was higher in the KdD group (42.15 [0.7 to 146.2] months) compared with the Kd group (24.05 [14.4 to 
60.8] months). The median total number of prior regimens was 2.0 for the KdD group and 1.5 for the Kd 
group. A higher incidence of subjects in the KdD group (76.7%) compared with the Kd group (37.5%) 
were refractory to the last prior line of therapy.  However, there was no apparent difference in the 
International Staging System stage, cytogenetic risk (determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization 
[FiSH]), or best overall response to prior therapy. 
Among subjects with a fatal adverse event, 6 subjects in the KdD group and 3 subjects in the Kd group 
had evidence of progressive disease as assessed by the investigator. The median time from first 
progressive disease to fatal adverse events was similar in the KdD group (1.05 months) compared with 
the Kd group (1.09 months). 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
Overall, 21.1% of subjects in the KdD group and 21.6% of subjects in the Kd group had at least 1 
adverse event leading to discontinuation of carfilzomib. The most frequently reported (occurring in ≥ 2% 
of subjects in either treatment group [KdD, Kd]) adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation of 
carfilzomib were cardiac failure (1.9%, 2.0%), hypertension (1.3%, 2.0%), and acute kidney injury 
(0.3%, 2.0%). Adverse events leading to the discontinuation of carfilzomib which occurred more 
frequently (≥ 1% difference) in the KdD group compared with the Kd group included fatigue, pneumonia, 
and septic shock. Adverse events leading to the discontinuation of carfilzomib which occurred more 
frequently (≥ 1% difference) in the Kd group compared with the KdD group included acute kidney injury 
and proteinuria.  
The most frequently reported (occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects in either treatment group [KdD, Kd]) grade 
≥ 3 adverse events that led to discontinuation of carfilzomib were fatigue (1.9%, 0.7%), hypertension 
(1.3%, 1.3%), cardiac failure (1.0%, 1.3%), acute kidney injury (0.3%, 2.0%), thrombotic

Overall, 9.1% of subjects in the KdD group had at least 1 adverse event leading to the discontinuation of 
daratumumab. The most frequently reported (occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects) adverse events that led to 
the discontinuation of daratumumab were cardiac failure (1.0%), pneumonia (1.3%), and septic shock 
(1.0%). 
The most frequently reported (occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects in the KdD group) grade ≥ 3 adverse events

Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any adverse events with an onset after 
the administration of the first dose of any study treatment and within the end of study or

were coded using MedDRA (version 22.0). 
Source:  Table 14-6.2.2 of Study 20160275 
Overall, respiratory tract infections accounted for most treatment-emergent infections.  Additionally, the 
higher incidence of infections in the KdD group compared with the Kd group appears to be attributable to 
a higher incidence of respiratory tract infections.   
The most frequently (≥ 10% of subjects in either treatment group [KdD, Kd]) reported adverse events 
within the SOC of infections and infestations were the preferred terms of upper respiratory tract infection 
(29.2%, 22.9%), pneumonia (17.9%, 12.4%), bronchitis (16.9%, 11.8%), influenza (11.0%, 6.5%), and 
respiratory tract infection (10.1%, 5.2%). 
Analysis of the events using the respiratory tract infections (HLGT) adverse events of interest strategy 
showed a higher incidence in the KdD group (73.1%) compared with the Kd group (54.9%).

Adverse drug reactions 
Carfilzomib ADRs 
Potential new adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for carfilzomib were evaluated based on the primary 
analysis of the KdD 20/56 mg/m2 twice-weekly group from CANDOR but, according to the algorithm, no 
Assessment report

new ADRs for carfilzomib were identified. The ADRs on the prescribing information are based on the 
previously assessed trials with carfilzomib. 
Daratumumab ADRs 
New ADRs for daratumumab were evaluated by Janssen’s medical experts based on the safety data from 
CANDOR using the definition of ADRs from the ICH guideline. The only new ADR identified for 
daratumumab from CANDOR was sepsis (serious adverse event incidence:  KdD:  3.9%, Kd:  1.3%). 
Sepsis does not represent a new important identified risk for daratumumab as sepsis is diagnosed, 
monitored, and managed through routine medical practice in these patients and the event does not 
require any additional risk minimization or additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
Safety in special populations 
In CANDOR, the subject incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was evaluated by age 
(< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years and < 75 years versus ≥ 75 years).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Carfilzomib  
No changes have been identified from the current carfilzomib product profile. Carfilzomib is primarily 
metabolized through peptidase and epoxide hydrolase activities, and as a result, the pharmacokinetic 
profile of carfilzomib is unlikely to be affected by concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 
inhibitors and inducers. Carfilzomib is not expected to influence exposure of other drugs.  
Daratumumab  
No interactions with concomitant medications are expected.  
Daratumumab peak and trough concentrations at similar timepoints are comparable across monotherapy 
and combination therapy studies, including across different regimens within the same study, indicating 
that the regimen difference has no impact on the concentration of daratumumab. 
Post marketing experience 
Carfilzomib  
The first approval for marketing worldwide for carfilzomib was in the United States on 20 July 2012. The 
EU approval for carfilzomib was granted on 19 November 2015. As of 17 October 2019, 66 countries 
(including the 28 EU member states) have granted marketing approval for carfilzomib with 1 or more 
indications.  
Daratumumab  
Daratumumab first received marketing authorization in the United States on 16 November 2015. The EU 
approval for daratumumab was granted on 20 May 2016. As of 23 October 2019, daratumumab was 
approved in 88 countries with 1 or more indications.  
Postmarketing Reports  
Carfilzomib  
As of 17 October 2019, Amgen received a total of 10330 ADRs cumulatively from medically confirmed and 
unconfirmed spontaneous sources, of which 4985 were serious and 5345 were nonserious. The MAH has 
also received a total of 7345 serious adverse reactions cumulatively from noninterventional 
postmarketing sources.  
Daratumumab  
A cumulative review was performed on all postmarketing spontaneous cases of daratumumab and all 
events received by Janssen Global Medical Safety and entered into global safety database cumulatively 
through 04 March 2019. The results suggest that the drug’s postmarketing safety profile is consistent 
with the known safety profile of daratumumab as a single agent or in combination therapy.  
Overall, review of postmarketing spontaneous reports did not identify any new safety signal.  
Summary of Published Safety Data  
Carfilzomib  
Literature through 19 January 2019 is summarized in Section 11 of PBRER; number 7. As of 17 October 
2019, no new and significant safety findings have been identified from the literature.

As of 15 May 2019, the overall rates and types of adverse events reported within the scientific and 
medical literature, including relevant published conference abstracts, were generally consistent with the 
known safety profile of either daratumumab or other anticancer agents used in the 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Carfilzomib has a known safety profile, based mainly on the results of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR studies and 
other complementary studies. This new safety assessment, for the proposed new combination of 
Carfilzomib/Daratumumab/Dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have 
received, at least, one previous treatment, is based on the results of Study 20160275 (CANDOR).  
Overall, the safety results from CANDOR study are similar to the previously known for carfilzomib but it 
should beborn  in mind that adding daratumumab to the combination, may increase the toxicity and 
change the management of adverse events during treatment. 
In the CANDOR Study, carfilzomib exposure was longer in the KdD arm (58.36 vs 40.29 weeks), which 
could have had an impact on AEs incidence. After adjusting for exposure, the risk estimates for AEs 
remained higher in the KdD arm compared with the Kd arm as well as fatal AEs, however, serious 
adverse events appeared almost similar between treatment arms. Also, the median exposure is longer for 
daratumumab than carfilzomib in KdD arm (68.14 vs 58.36 weeks), with a difference of two cycles in the 
median number of them received. This suggests patients continued receiving daratumumab after 
discontinuing carfilzomib, which could have had an impact on the incidence and allocation of reported 
AEs. During the procedure, updated safety data with a data cut-off 19 Jan 2020 were provided. Exposure-
adjusted estimates were also included within the updated safety results and showed a similar trend than 
in the interim analysis, higher AEs incidences were reported in the KDd arm compared with the control 
arm, also related with the longer exposure reported in that arm. 
Most common reported AEs (preferred term) for KdD in the CANDOR study were thrombocytopenia 
(37.3%), anaemia (32.8%), diarrhoea (31.5%), hypertension (30.5%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(29.2%) and fatigue (24.4%). Subject incidence highest differences in the KdD group compared with the 
Kd group (KdD, Kd) were thrombocytopenia (37.3%, 29.4%), diarrhea (31.5%, 14.4%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (29.2%, 22.9%), fatigue (24.4%, 18.3%), nausea (18.2%, 13.1%), pneumonia 
(17.9%, 12.4%), insomnia (17.9%, 11.1%), bronchitis (16.9%, 11.8%), back pain (16.2%, 9.8%), 
infusion-related reaction (7.8%, 2.0%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (6.5%, 1.3%). The only ones 
not described on carfilzomib nor daratumumab SmPCs were insomnia and back pain. There were some 
AEs which subject incidences were higher in the Kd arm: asthenia, blood and lymphatic system disorders 
(SOC), dyspnoea, renal and urinary disorders (SOC). All of them are described on carfilzomib SmPC. 
Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were reported for a higher incidence of subjects in the KdD group (82.1%) 
compared with the Kd group (73.9%). Higher incidence of grade ≥ 3 adverse events of the SOC of 
infections and infestations in KdD arm is remarkable (37.3% vs 29.4%). This appears to be attributable 
to a higher incidence of sepsis and lower and upper respiratory tract infections but all preferred terms had 
higher subject incidences in the KdD treatment arm except for urinary tract infections, which were higher 
for Kd arm. Differences between incidence of thrombocytopenia in both arms (16.3% vs 24.4%) in favour 
of KdD is worrying and could have an impact on haemorrhagic adverse events, which are an identified 
AESI for both carfilzomib and daratumumab. Having said that, an increase in haemorrhagic events was 
not observed in patients treated with KdD compared to Kd in the CANDOR study (14.3% vs 11.8%, 
respectively). On the contrary, deep vein thrombosis, cardiac failure and acute kidney injury reported 
higher incidences in Kd treatment arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/593622/2020 
Page 115/127 
 
 
  
  
 
Regarding fatal AEs, 8 (5.2%) patients from Kd arm and 30 (9.7%) patients from KdD treatment arm 
died due to an TEAE, which means a 4.5% higher incidence for fatal AEs in KdD arm. The imbalance in 
the overall fatal adverse events appear to be attributable mainly to events in the SOC infections and 
infestations, where higher incidences of deaths were reported for all preferred terms in this group except 
for sepsis and influenza. Also, cardiac disorders (cardiac arrest, cardio-respiratory arrest and cardiac 
failure), as cause of deaths, were reported for 4 (1.3%) patients in the KdD arm while none for the Kd 
group. Among subjects with fatal adverse events, the median age of subjects with fatal adverse events 
was higher in the KdD group (68.5 years) compared with the Kd group (61.0 years), while in the ITT 
population, median age between groups was similar. Considering frailty status of the subjects with a fatal 
adverse event, a lower proportion of subjects in the KdD group (46.7%) compared with the Kd group 
(75.0%) had a frailty status of fit at baseline. Of note, in the ITT population, a higher proportion of 
subjects in the KdD group (56.4%) compared with the Kd group (44.2%) had a frailty status of fit at 
baseline.  
Regarding medical history, it is worthy pointing out the following slightly unbalances between arms (Kd, 
KdD): vascular disorders (59.7%, 49.7%), an abnormal baseline electrocardiogram interpretation 
(34.4%, 26.2%), baseline history of hypertension (54.5%, 43.3%). These unbalances could have impact 
on safety finding, especially regarding cardiac AEs and fatal AEs due to cardiac events. An increased risk 
of cardiac adverse events and/or fatal cardiac adverse events was observed in patients treated with KdD 
compared with Kd, particularly in patients with baseline characteristics of vascular disorders, 
hypertension and abnormal ECG, although reported rates for all cardiac and vascular-related AEs did not 
show any particular trend based on the D120 updated safety data. For instance, regarding common AEs, 
cardiac arrest (1% vs 0%), atrial fibrillation (1.6% vs 0.7%) and acute myocardial infarction (1% vs 
0.7%) were reported in higher incidences in KdD arm, while, on the contrary, cardiac failure (1.3% vs 
2.6%), deep vein thrombosis (0.3% vs 1.3%) and angina pectoris (0.3% vs 1.3%) showed higher rates 
in the Kd arm (data from updated safety cutoff date). In comparison with the primary analysis, there 
were 5 additional serious ischemic heart disease eventsreported. Most of the subjects presented pre-
existing risk factors such as prior cardiac disease and hypertension.  Information on the increased 
incidence of cardiac events and/or fatal cardiac adverse events in patiets treated with KdD compared with 
Kd in patients with baseline characteristics or vascular disorders, hypertension and abnormal ECG is 
reflected in the SmPC (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
By previously stablished criteria, additional ADRs for daratumumab have been identified in this new safety 
data cutoff, being hypertension one of them. No new ADRs have been identified for carfilzomib.  
In the KdD group, 76.7% of subjects with fatal adverse events were refractory to the last prior line of 
therapy, compared with 37.5% in the Kd group. In comparison, in the intent-to-treat population, 52.9% 
of subjects in the KdD group and 61.7% of subjects in the Kd group were refractory to the last prior line 
of therapy. It was suspected that being refractory to the prior treatment line could have consequences on 
the tolerability to this combination but focusing on AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or dose 
reduction, no clear trend towards either of the arms was identified. 
Similar incidence of AEs that led to discontinuation of carfilzomib were reported in both treatment arms. 
For carfilzomib dose reductions, 30 (19.6%) patients from Kd arm and 77 (25%) patients in the KdD 
arms suffered any AEs that led to carfilzomib dose reduction. The most common reported motives for 
these reductions, for both arms, were: hypertension, dyspnoea and fatigue. The incidences of treatment-
emergent adverse events leading to any study treatment discontinuation for the refractory KdD and Kd 
subgroups and the nonrefractory KdD and Kd subgroups were higher in the updated safety analyses: 
25.2%, 22.1%, 23.4% and 27.6%, respectively. The incidences of adverse events leading to carfilzomib 
discontinuation for the refractory KdD and Kd subgroups and the nonrefractory KdD and Kd subgroups 
were 23.9%, 18.9%, 22.8%, and 25.9%. However, the proportion of patient that discontinued 
dexamethasone was more than double in the Kd arm compared to the KdD arm (24.2% vs. 10.7%), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/593622/2020 
Page 116/127 
 
 
  
  
probably due to the fact that some patients from the KDd arm maintained treatment with daratumumab 
(and dexamethasone) while discontinuated carfilzomib treatment. 
Adverse events of interest for both carfilzomib and daratumumab include haemorrhage, tumor lysis 
syndrome, and hepatitis B reactivation. One subject of the KdD arm suffered fatal tumor lysis syndrome. 
Regarding AESI for carfilzomib, some differences could be clinically relevant, especially the ones found for 
cardiac events, leukopenia (mainly neutropenia), thrombocytopenia and infections, including opportunistic 
and viral infections. Besides, some other AESI for carfilzomib were more frequently reported in the KdD 
arm, such as infusion related reactions (7.8% KdD vs 2.0% Kd) and peripheral neuropathy (17.2% KdD 
vs 8.5% Kd). Overall, these differences may be expected to some extent taking into account the added 
effect of daratumumab. However, it is striking the higher rate, more than double, of PRES reported in the 
KdD arm compared to the Kd (12.3% vs. 5.2%). However, according to the MAH, only two cases met the 
case definition for PRES (presence of 4 classic symptons). In addition, a search from the daratumumab 
global database was performed by the MAH, where some cases were reported, and from the registrational 
trials, where no association between this event and the treatment with daratumumab was identified. 
PRES is already included as an ADR for carfilzomib. 
Sepsis was identified as a new ADR for daratumumab based on CANDOR results, while no new ADRs for 
carfilzomib were identified through this study. 
Being infections and infestations the most common reported AEs (by SOC), baseline demographics of 
patients who suffered them were included in the CSR but this data does not show any specific trend. 
In CANDOR, the subject incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was evaluated by age 
(< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years and < 75 years versus ≥ 75 years) and conclusions were similar to the ones 
extracted from the overall safety population, apart from a higher number of fatal AEs reported in this 
population of elderly patients. Information on the higher incidence of fatal adverse events in elderly 
patients has been included in the PI (section 4.8).   
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to include safety findings from CANDOR trial.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In safety terms, adding daratumumab to carfilzomib/dexamethasone in the target population results in 
predictable increased toxicity corresponding to the known safety profile of both medicinal products. 
Safety results were worse for KdD arm vs. Kd arm, for all analysed levels: incidence AEs (96.1% vs 
99.4%), Grade ≥ 3 (73.9% vs 82.1%), serious AEs (45.8% vs 56.2%) and fatal (5.2% vs 9.7%) although 
longer exposure in the KdD treatment arm could have had an impact on this data. 
An increased risk of different types of infections has been reported in the CANDOR study and patients 
should be closely monitored. 
Overall, the toxicity profile of KdD, based on the results form CANDOR study, is more pronounced than 
the Kd combination but manageable in clinical practice. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple myeloma, an oligoclonal neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells, is the second most common 
hematologic malignancy with an estimated incidence worldwide in 2018 of 159 985 persons (Ferlay et al, 
2018).  The 5-year prevalence of multiple myeloma worldwide was estimated at 376 005 persons.   
The primary goals of treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma are to achieve deep and 
durable response and subsequently longer survival with an acceptable level of toxicity.  Additional goals 
are to prevent or delay disease-related morbidity (including bone fractures and renal insufficiency), to 
provide relief from pain and other disease-related symptoms, and to maintain the best possible quality of 
life (World Health Organization, 2019; Landgren and Iskander, 2017; Durie, 2010; Durie, 2005).   
Multiple myeloma may represent less than 1% of all cancer diagnoses but contributes to significant 
disease burden with over 2 million disability-adjusted life-years (Cowan et al, 2018; Bray et al, 2013).  
Despite recent therapeutic advances which have prolonged survival, multiple myeloma remains a fatal 
disease with nearly 100 000 annual deaths worldwide (1% of cancer deaths) (Cowan et al, 2018; 
Kazandjian, 2016; Ferlay et al, 2015).  Multiple myeloma is a disease of older adults, with a median age 
at diagnosis of 69 years (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Stat Facts, 2019). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Regimens used and/or approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma incorporate conventional agents 
such as alkylating agents, anthracyclines, and corticosteroids, as well as novel agents including 
immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and histone deacetylase 
inhibitors (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2020; Moreau et al, 2017).  The novel and 
conventional agents are typically combined as doublet or triplet regimens and are sequenced across 
multiple lines of therapy.   
Current treatment guidelines by NCCN and ESMO recommend regimens containing an IMiD for frontline 
therapy as well as lenalidomide for maintenance therapy, which has become standard of care 
(NCCN, 2020; Facon et al, 2018; Pulte et al, 2018; Moreau et al, 2017; McCarthy et al, 2017).     
Despite recent therapeutic advances, relapse is virtually inevitable and patients can become refractory to 
IMiDs (Nijhof et al, 2018; Sonneveld et al, 2017; Cornell and Kassim, 2016).  Outcomes tend to be worse 
for patients who are refractory to lenalidomide than the overall population (Moreau et al, 2019).

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The CANDOR study was designed to allow the recruitment of patients with MM previously treated with at 
least one prior line (transplant is considered as 1 line of therapy) but not more than three. Patients were 
2:1 randomized to KdD and Kd arms, using as stratification factors: original ISS stage, lines of therapy, 
prior PI exposure and prior CD38 Ab exposure. Prior therapy with carfilzomib and anti-CD38 antibodies 
were allowed as previous treatment, provided at least PR was obtained and there was a treatment-free 
interval of 6 months. Patients refractory to any prior lenalidomide treatment and any prior PI-including 
regimen were allowed.  
Posology used for Kyprolis is in line with posology authorized based Endeavor study in the same 
population. Posology for daratumumab is in line with posology reflected in the SmPC.  
The rational for the selected dose of 56 mg/m2 twice-weekly was based on the available mature safety 
long-term data for Kd from the ENDEAVOR study and the fact that daratumumab had already been added 
to other doublets, including proteasome inhibitors without adding considerable toxicity.  
PFS was the primary endpoint, with ORR, MRD(-)CR and OS as key secondary endpoints. The use of PFS 
as main outcome variable is acceptable, given that there are different efficacious treatment alternatives 
that patients could receive, which will likely modify the expected survival.  
Although the design of the study is unblinded, the use of an IRC to assess response (as defined by IMWG-
URC) is endorsed. In addition, the different sensitive analyses planned increase the level of robustness of 
the results.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The population recruited in the study is the one expected at relapse.  
A statistically significant difference was observed for PFS (as assessed by the IRC) between the KdD and 
Kd groups (HR = 0.630; 95% CI: 0.464, 0.854; p = 0.0014) in the final PFS analysis. This result seems 
robust as the different sensitive analyses (investigator and ORCA among others) offer similar results. 
The other secondary key variables ORR and MRD(-)CR at 12 months (at a 10-5 level) according to IRC 
support the PFS results. The ORR as assessed by IRC was 84.3% (95% CI: 79.8, 88.1) in the KdD group 
and 74.7% (95% CI: 67.0, 81.3) in the Kd group (odds ratio: 1.925 [95% CI: 1.184, 3.129]; p = 
0.0040). The MRD[-]CR rate at 12 months (at a 10-5 level) based on IRC assessment was 12.5% (95% 
CI: 9.0, 16.7) in the KdD group and 1.3% (95% CI: 0.2, 4.6) in the Kd group (odds ratio: 11.329 [95% 
CI: 2.703, 47.476]; p < 0.0001). The sensitive analyses (investigator and ORCA among others) for ORR 
and MDR(-)CR offer similar results.  
Additional secondary endpoints such as DoR and time to next treatment are overall in line with PFS. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Data from only 1 patient in KdD arm received previous CD38 therapy are included in this submission 
which does not allow assessment of previous exposure effect. This information is included in section 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
Lenalidomide and IMiD was administered to 42.3% and 67.8%, respectively with slightly differences 
between arms (lenalidomide: 48.1% in Kd and 39.4% in KdD and IMiD: 71.4% in Kd and 66.0% in KdD). 
These unbalances are lower for the refractory populations, maximum 4% in favour of KdD between arms. 
That could be a confounding factor on results observed, especially on subgroups analyses.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/593622/2020 
Page 122/127 
 
 
  
  
Overall survival data were not mature at the time of the analysis, and while, a trend toward longer OS in 
the KdD arm compared with Kd armin the overall population and even in elderly patients for OS could be 
observed. Current OS data are not mature. The first OS interim analysis offered a positive trend for KdD 
vs Kd (HR 0.745 (95% CI: 0.491, 1.131; p = 0.0836). The OS event-free rate was 84.5% in the KdD 
group and 85.2% in the Kd group at 12 months and 79.9% in the KdD group and 74.4% in the Kd group 
at 18 months. Results from a second IA were overall consistent with the first IA. A trend in favour of KdD 
was observed although statistical significance was not reached (HR 0.758; 95% CI: 0.536, 1.073; p = 
0.0590). The MAH has accepted a recommendation from the CHMP to provide data from an additional 
interim analysis for OS and the final analysis post authorization.  
Overall, the subgroups analyses suggested a potential benefit of KdD vs Kd in most subgroups. However, 
results should be interpreted with caution since there are several subgroups with categories crossing 1 
and there are several inconsistences in some subgroups between PFS and ORR analysis. There are two 
subgroups in which the benefit of KdD vs Kd seems to be less clear in all subgroup analyses: patients > 
75 and patients refractory to bortezomib and ixazomib. It is noted that the percentage of subjects aged 
75 to 84 years was lower in the KdD group (9.0%) than in the Kd group (14.3%) and no patients ≥ 85 
years have been included in this study. It is considered that the small size of the subgroup of patients 
over 75 years of age precludes any firm conclusion, the available information is reflected in the PI, to 
make it available to the prescribing physician. Furthermore, while a trend in favour of KdD is observed in 
the overall population and even in elderly patients for OS, according to the KM curves there was a higher 
rate of deaths in elderly patients treated with KdD compared with those receiving Kd during 
(approximately) the first year of treatment. This could be related to the higher rate of fatal adverse 
events reported in subjects ≥ 65 years of age. A statement in this regard is included in the PI. 
In the same way, only a non-statistically significant positive trend was observed in PFS for the European 
region subgroup (HR= 0.857 [95% CI: 0.596 - 1.231], 66% of the subjects) whereas results were highly 
statistically significant for the North-America region (HR= 0.041 [95% CI=0.005; 0.339], 7% of the 
subjects). Baseline disease characteristics were further explored in both groups to clarify if a worse 
disease prognosis of European subjects at randomization could have impacted the results but no clear 
trend was identified. Moreover, the small size of the North America subgroup and the fact that region was 
not a stratification factor preclude any definitive interpretation of these results. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In CANDOR, 306 subjects (99.4%) in the KdD group and 147 subjects (96.1%) in the Kd group had at 
least 1 adverse event. A higher subject incidence in the KdD group compared with the Kd group was 
reported (KdD, Kd) for grade ≥ 3 adverse events (82.1%, 73.9%), serious adverse events (56.2%, 45.8%), 
and fatal adverse events (9.7%, 5.2%).  A similar subject incidence in the KdD group and the Kd group 
was reported for adverse events that led to the discontinuation of carfilzomib (KdD:  21.1%, Kd:  21.6%). 
Adverse events that occurred with a ≥ 5% higher subject incidence in the KdD group compared with the 
Kd group (KdD, Kd) were thrombocytopenia (37.3%, 29.4%), diarrhea (31.5%, 14.4%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (29.2%, 22.9%), fatigue (24.4%, 18.3%), nausea (18.2%, 13.1%), pneumonia 
(17.9%, 12.4%), insomnia (17.9%, 11.1%), bronchitis (16.9%, 11.8%), back pain (16.2%, 9.8%), 
infusion-related reaction (7.8%, 2.0%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (6.5%, 1.3%). No adverse 
events occurred with a ≥ 5% higher subject incidence in the Kd group than in the KdD group. 
Grade ≥ 3 adverse events of the SOC of infections and infestations occurred more frequently (≥ 5% 
difference in subject incidence) in the KdD group (37.3%) compared with the Kd group (29.4%). Grade ≥ 
3 adverse events that occurred with a ≥ 2% higher subject incidence in the KdD group compared with the 
Kd group (KdD, Kd) were thrombocytopenia (24.4%, 16.3%), anemia (16.6%, 14.4%), neutropenia 
Assessment report

(8.4%, 5.9%), pneumonia (13.3%, 8.5%), sepsis (3.9%, 1.3%), influenza (3.6%, 0.7%), hypertension 
(17.5%, 13.1%), fatigue (7.8%, 4.6%), and diarrhea (3.9%, 0.7%). 
Pneumonia and thrombocytopenia were grade ≥ 3 adverse events that occurred more frequently (≥ 5% 
difference) in the Kd group than in the KdD group (24.4 versus 16.3%). 
It should also be pointed out that incidence of reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome 
(PRES), already reported with carfilzomib, was higher in the KdD arm (12.3% versus 5.2%). 
Serious adverse events of the SOCs with a ≥ 2% difference in the KdD group compared with the Kd group 
(KdD, Kd) were infections and infestations (29.5%, 24.8%) and general disorders and administration site 
conditions (7.5%, 3.9%). 
Fatal adverse events of the SOCs with a ≥ 1% difference in the KdD group compared with the Kd group 
(KdD, Kd) were infections and infestations (4.5%, 2.6%) and cardiac disorders (1.3%, 0.0%). Events from 
the SOC infections and infestations accounted for most fatal adverse events in the KdD group and 
included septic shock (5 subjects [1.6%]), pneumonia (4 subjects [1.3%]), and sepsis (3 subjects 
[1.0%]). 
The most frequently reported (occurring in ≥ 2% of subjects in either treatment group [KdD, Kd]) 
adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation of carfilzomib were cardiac failure (1.9%, 2.0%), 
hypertension (1.3%, 2.0%), and acute kidney injury (0.3%, 2.0%). The most frequently reported 
(occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects in either treatment group [KdD, Kd]) grade ≥ 3 adverse events that led to 
discontinuation of carfilzomib were fatigue (1.9%, 0.7%), hypertension (1.3%, 1.3%), cardiac failure 
(1.0%, 1.3%), acute kidney injury (0.3%, 2.0%), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (0.6%, 1.3%), 
plasma cell myeloma (0.6%, 1.3%), pulmonary oedema (0.6%, 1.3%), pneumonia (1.3%, 0.0%), 
proteinuria (0.3%, 1.3%), and septic shock (1.0%, 0.0%).  
Overall, 9.1% of subjects in the KdD group had at least 1 adverse event leading to the discontinuation of 
daratumumab. The most frequently reported (occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects) adverse events that led to 
the discontinuation of daratumumab were cardiac failure (1.0%), pneumonia (1.3%), and septic shock 
(1.0%). 
The most frequently reported (occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects in the KdD group) grade ≥ 3 adverse events 
that led to the discontinuation of daratumumab were pneumonia (1.3%) and septic shock (1.0%). 
Updated safety data provided showed similar trends. Higher AEs incidences were found for KDd arm in all 
the above-mentioned categories, in relation with the significant longer exposure reported for the 
experimental arm. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Regarding medical history, some unbalances were observed between arms (Kd, KdD): vascular disorders 
(59.7%, 49.7%), an abnormal baseline electrocardiogram interpretation (34.4%, 26.2%), baseline 
history of hypertension (54.5%, 43.3%). These unbalances could have impact on safety finding, 
especially regarding cardiac AEs and fatal AEs due to cardiac events. An increased risk of cardiac adverse 
events and/or fatal cardiac adverse events was observed in patients treated with KdD compared with Kd, 
particularly in patients with baseline characteristics of vascular disorders, hypertension and abnormal 
ECG, although no clear trend was identified when analysing by SOC and PT. This information is included 
in the PI. 
A higher rate of fatal AEs was reported in the KdD arm compared to the Kd arm (9.7% vs.5.2%), mainly 
driven by infections (particularly septic shock and pneumonia) and cardiac disorders. The latter is of 
concern taking into account the apparently better “cardiovascular status” of patients treated with KdD, as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/593622/2020 
Page 124/127 
 
 
  
  
stated before. Furthermore, more than a half of the reported deaths in the KdD arm occurred in elderly 
patients (i.e. ≥65 years). KdD should be used with caution in patients ≥75 years after careful 
consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. 
In the KdD group, 76.7% of subjects with fatal adverse events were refractory to the last prior line of 
therapy, compared with 37.5% in the Kd group. In comparison, in the intent-to-treat population, 52.9% 
of subjects in the KdD group and 61.7% of subjects in the Kd group were refractory to the last prior line 
of therapy. This could have consequences on the tolerability to this combination but incidences of AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation and dose reductions were similar across all subgroups when 
compared to overall population, although were higher for KDd arm in almost all cases.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Results on PFS, ORR and MRD(-)CR at 12 months seem to be consistent and robust.  
Overall, the subgroups analyses suggested a potential benefit of KdD vs Kd in most subgroups. However, 
results should be interpreted with caution since there are several subgroups with categories crossing 1 
and there are several inconsistences in some subgroups between PFS and ORR analysis. There are two 
subgroups in which the benefit of KdD vs Kd seems to be less clear in all subgroup analyses: patients > 
75 and refractory to bortezomib and ixazomib. The (limited) available information in the subgroup of 
patients over 75 years of age should be reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
From a safety point of view, the addition of daratumumab to Kd results in a predictable increased toxicity 
corresponding to the known safety profile of both medicinal products. This increase is particularly 
noticeable for cardiac disorders, haematological toxicity and infections, some of them with a fatal 
outcome. Moreover, it is of concern the higher rate of fatal adverse events observed in elderly patients 
treated with KdD. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The superiority of the new combination of carfilzomib plus dexamethasone plus daratumumab (KdD) vs. 
carfilzomib plus dexamethasone (Kd) has been shown in terms of improved PFS and improved depth of 
response. OS results showed an apparently significant benefit for those patients treated with KdD.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kyprolis is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 12.0 of the RMP has also been submitted.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kyprolis is not similar to Imnovid, Farydak, Darzalex, 
Ninlaro and Blenrep within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
5.  EPAR changes

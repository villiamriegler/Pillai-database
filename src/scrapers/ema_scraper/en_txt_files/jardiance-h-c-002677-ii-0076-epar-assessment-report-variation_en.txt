2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Empagliflozin has been approved in Europe since May 2014. Empagliflozin is indicated in adults from age 
18 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic 
control, either as monotherapy in patients for whom use of metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance, 
or as add-on therapy to other glucose lowering medicinal products including insulin.  
The purpose of this application is to fulfil the requirement pursuant to Regulation EC No 1901/2006 for a 
Paediatric Investigation Plan as agreed by the Paediatric Development Committee and adopted by the 
European Medicines Agency, and to seek the extension of the indication for empagliflozin in T2DM to 
include treatment of children aged 10 years and above based on clinical data on the use of empagliflozin 
in children and adolescents with T2DM who were treated with metformin and/or insulin or who were not 
tolerating metformin. 
This application is supported by data from study DINAMO 1218-0091, “A double-blind, randomised, 
placebo-controlled, parallel group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin and linagliptin 
over 26 weeks, with a double-blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks, in children 
and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus”. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
The incidence of T2DM in children is increasing worldwide, and the main driver is the increased 
prevalence and degree of childhood obesity. Childhood T2DM is still relatively rare in Europe, with a 
prevalence of approximately 2.5 per 100 thousand. 
Disease or condition 
As in adults, T2DM in children is characterised by hyperglycaemia driven by insulin resistance and relative 
insulin deficiency. Developing T2DM at a younger age is associated with a considerably higher risk of 
long-term cardiovascular disease compared with those who develop T2DM in the middle age. The rapid 
deterioration in glucose regulation in children as compared with adults may contribute to the greater risk 
for micro- and macrovascular complications in children with T2DM as they develop into adults. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The requested indication is an extension of the T2DM indication as follows (added wording in bold 
underlined): 
Jardiance is indicated in adults and children aged 10 years and above for the treatment of 
insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
- 
- 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes 
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/542987/2023 
Page 9/60 
 
 
 
 
 
Epidemiology 
The incidence of T2DM in children is increasing worldwide, and the main driver is the increased 
prevalence and degree of childhood obesity. Paediatric T2DM, which is more prevalent in populations with 
low socioeconomic and educational status, is still relatively rare in Europe, with a prevalence of 
approximately 2.5 per 100 thousand.  
Biologic features  
As in adults, T2DM in children is characterised by hyperglycaemia driven by insulin resistance and relative 
insulin deficiency. The physiologic insulin resistance associated with pubertal development may 
exacerbate glucose dysregulation in susceptible children. Insulin secretion is more impaired in 
adolescents (approximately 85% reduction) as compared to adults (approximately 50% reduction) at the 
time of diagnosis of T2DM. Thus, the deterioration in insulin secretion appears to be more rapid in 
adolescents than in adults. 
Clinical presentation and prognosis 
Developing T2DM at a younger age is associated with a considerably higher risk of long-term 
cardiovascular disease compared with those who develop T2DM in the middle age. The rapid deterioration 
in glucose regulation in children as compared with adults may contribute to the greater risk for micro- 
and macrovascular complications in children with T2DM as they develop into adults. 
Management 
Management of T2DM in children involves lifestyle modifications. Pharmacologic glucose-lowering 
treatment is often necessary and includes metformin, insulin, or a combination of both. Several GLP-1 
receptor agonists have already been approved for the use in paediatric patients. In addition, another 
SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin) is approved for the use in paediatric patients aged 10 years and above. An 
ongoing study is investigating the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in children and adolescents (>=10 
to <18 Years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Empagliflozin is an orally administered, potent, and highly selective SGLT-2 inhibitor developed by BI. 
Empagliflozin is approved and marketed for the treatment of adults with T2DM, for the prevention of CV 
events in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease, and in adults with heart failure 
independent of left ventricular ejection fraction. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical development programme supporting the use of empagliflozin in paediatric patients with T2DM 
includes 2 completed studies: 
•  Study 1218-0091, “A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin and linagliptin over 26 weeks, with a double-
blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks, in children and adolescents with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus” 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/542987/2023 
Page 10/60 
 
 
 
 
•  Study 1245.87, “A Randomised, single-dose, parallel group, study to investigate the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin in children and adolescents aged 10 to 
less than 18 years (and adults below 25 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus” 
Both of these studies were part of Jardiance’s PIP, as agreed by the PDCO and EMA in decision 
P/0283/2021. 
The MAH did not apply for CHMP scientific advice on the paediatric development of Jardiance.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP, as claimed by the MAH. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Introduction 
In accordance with Article 8 (ca) and (g) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, an application for 
marketing authorization shall be accompanied by an ERA, evaluating any potential risks of the medicinal 
product to the environment. For Type II variation applications for known substances, for which an ERA is 
not considered necessary, a rationale for the absence of an ERA should be provided, taking into 
consideration a possible significant increase of environmental exposure to the drug substance. The 
present statement, providing this rationale for Jardiance (empagliflozin) 10 and 25 mg film-coated 
tablets, was carried out according to the following guidance document of the Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP): “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products 
for human use” (EMA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006). 
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for empagliflozin [U13-1023-01] was submitted with the initial 
MAA and an updated ERA after completion of an additional study [q00222007-01]. The risk assessment 
resulted in the conclusion that no significant impact on the environment is expected. 
In the current ERA, the estimation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of empagliflozin in 
the various environmental compartments is based on the default market penetration factor (Fpen = 
0.01), as provided in the EMA guideline, and the highest maximum daily dose of 25 mg. The 
recommended maximum daily dose of the newly proposed indication (Type 2 Diabetes - paediatric 
indication) will be 25 mg. 
The default Fpen is based on a very conservative worst-case estimation, meaning that 1% of all EU 
inhabitants are treated 365 d/a with the recommended maximum daily dose. The market penetration 
factor was not refined though, e.g., by using the much smaller actual amount of substance placed on the 
market. Therefore, the effects on the environment by adding the new intended Type 2 Diabetes - 
paediatric indication with a much smaller patient group are considered negligible and well covered by the 
used Fpen.  The ERA tables, including calculations for all proposed indications for Jardiance, were updated 
(as indicated in tables) as follows:

To calculate the PEC values, taking into consideration all proposed indications of Jardiance, the default 
market penetration factor (Fpen) of 0.01 (not refined) and the sum of the maximum daily doses, i.e. 80 
mg (see Table 1), have been applied. 
For the calculation of the PEC/PNEC ratios in the various environmental compartments the PNEC values as 
mentioned in the original Environmental Risk Assessment [q00222007-01] have been used (see Table 2 
and Table 3).

ERA Phase II – Tier A OECD 308 and Tier B OECD 218 studies 
In the water sediment study, the relevant transformation products M3 and M12 generated in the 
water/sediment study exceeded the P trigger for sediment (M3) and water (M12), but only after 
conversion to 12°C EU outdoor temperature, and none of the detected transformation products showed 
continuously increasing concentration during the study. 
Consequently, following the ‘total residue approach’ (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 of 17 March 2011) a 
toxicity study in sediment-dwelling Chironomid larvae (OECD 218) was conducted resulting in the 
conclusion that the use of empagliflozin and its transformation products can be considered as insignificant 
environmental risk for the compartment sediment.

However, since the study on identification of metabolites [U13-1652-01] indicates that metabolite M3 
may be a stereoisomer of the parent compound, it might be that M3 has certain pharmacologically 
activity. Therefore, below, information on the structure of M3 and M1 (M12 was instable and could not be 
further analysed) as well as the DT50 values for total system, sediment and water recalculated to 12 °C 
for empagliflozin and the relevant transformation products M3, M1 and M12 are given. M3 is very 
persistent in the sediment (DT50 > 180 days) and M12 is persistent in water (DT50 > 40 days).

Conclusion 
For all three compartments, the PEC/PNEC ratios for all proposed indications of Jardiance are clearly 
below the trigger values of 1 and 0.1, respectively. Additionally, empagliflozin and its transformation 
products can be considered as insignificant environmental risk for the compartment sediment. 
Hence, the ERA submitted with the initial MAA remains valid for the current type II variation covering the 
additional proposed indication. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The current application concerns an extension of the indication of Jardiance from adult patients to 
children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes. No new non-clinical data have been submitted in 
this application, which is considered acceptable for the extension of indication. 
The applicant, as requested, updated the ERA and ERA summary table with the new total PECSW value of 
all approved indications including the recently approved chronic kidney disease indication. 
From a non-clinical view, the proposed extended indication is considered approvable. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of empagliflozin.  
- Considering the above data, empagliflozin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
From a non-clinical view, the proposed extended indication is considered approvable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The clinical development programme supporting the use of empagliflozin in paediatric patients with T2DM 
includes 2 completed studies: 
•  Study 1218-0091, “A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin and linagliptin over 26 weeks, with a double-
blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks, in children and adolescents with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus” 
•  Study 1245.87, “A Randomised, single-dose, parallel group, study to investigate the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin in children and adolescents aged 10 to 
less than 18 years (and adults below 25 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus”

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic data presented in this application are limited to data that support the extension of 
indication for empagliflozin to include treatment aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 
The initial marketing application of empagliflozin was assessed in procedure EMA/CHMP/137741/2014. 
The current procedure is supported by results from study 1245.87 (c09062077) and study 1218-0091 
(DINAMO). These studies have been specified as key binding elements in PIP (EMEA-000828-PIP01-
09-M09).  
Study 1245.87 was a single-dose trial (n = 27), in which the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
of empagliflozin was evaluated in paediatric patients with T2DM after administration of 5, 10 or 25 mg 
empagliflozin. Additionally, empagliflozin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were compared 
between paediatric and adult patients in an exposure-response analysis (c37380422-01). The study 
results of 1245.87 and exposure-response analysis (c37380422-01) have been assessed before in 
EMEA/H/C/002677/P46.  
Study 1218-0091 was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial that evaluated 
the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin and linagliptin over 26 weeks, with a double-blind active 
treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks, in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. Further details regarding study design are displayed in section 5.4 (clinical efficacy). In this 
study, pharmacokinetic samples were collected at pre-dose and after 1.5 hours after drug administration 
at week 26 and week 52.  
An updated population pharmacokinetic analysis and exposure-response analyses (c39218173-01) were 
presented in this procedure, which was based on the previously conducted analyses in adults and study 
1245.87 (c37380422-01). This analysis is extensively discussed below.  
The initially proposed posology in paediatric patients aged 10 years and older is similar to the adult 
patients. I.e. the recommended starting dose is 10 mg empagliflozin once daily. In patients tolerating 
empagliflozin 10 mg once daily and requiring additional glycaemic control, the dose can be increased to 
25 mg once daily. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods 
Samples of study 1218-0091 were analysed using a validated HPLC-MS/MS assay (SAP.1217). This is 
the same bioanalytical method as used in study 1245.87. The maximum storage duration from collection 
to extraction was reported as 1090 days at -20˚C, which was within the 1327 days long-term stability 
period. A total of 529 study samples were analysed in twelve runs. One run failed, which was reported as 
sample preparation error by the analyst. Furthermore, a total of 6 samples were reanalysed, because 
these were above the upper limit of quantification. 55 of 56 (98.2%) of the samples in the evaluation 
demonstrated a percent difference within ±20.0%, thus meeting the acceptance criteria. 
Population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analysis (c39218173-01) 
Objective 
Models for both population pharmacokinetic and population exposure-response were previously developed 
for empagliflozin (c37380422-01). These models were re-estimated using a Bayesian framework to 
characterise paediatric pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic (specifically, glycosylated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) lowering) for paediatric patients in Study 1218-0091 and assess any differences in relation to 
adults. The primary analysis objectives were to: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/542987/2023 
Page 16/60 
 
 
 
 
•  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin in paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) and assess any differences in relation to adult PK. 
•  Characterize the exposure-response of empagliflozin on HbA1c in paediatric patients with T2DM 
using data from Study 1218-0091 and assess any differences in relation to adult ER. 
Data 
A population pharmacokinetic model was previously developed with data from several studies in adults 
and from the single dose pediatric study 1245-0087. In this update, solely data of study 1218-0091 was 
used. This study randomised 157 children and adolescents from 10 to 17 years of age with T2DM to 
either placebo, linagliptin or empagliflozin. Pre-dose and 1.5 hour post-dose pharmacokinetic samples 
were collected at weeks 26 and 52. HbA1c samples were collected at baseline, week 4, 12, 26, 30, 42, 
52, but only data up to 26 weeks was included in the exposure-response analysis.   
A total of 74 patients were included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Subjects were 62.2% 
female, had a median age of 14.5 years (ranging from 10 to 17) and had a bodyweight range from 42.5 
to 169 kg. In these patients, 278 observations were eligible for inclusion (after exclusion of samples in 
the control linagliptin arm) in the population pharmacokinetic model. A total of 55 observations (19.8%) 
were reported as below the lower limit of quantification.  
The exposure-response analysis dataset included 103 subjects receiving empagliflozin or placebo 
treatment and contributing a total of 394 observations. Of these subjects, 39 received 10 mg of 
empagliflozin during weeks 1 to 26, 13 subjects received 10 mg of empagliflozin from weeks 1 to 14 and 
25 mg from weeks 15 to 26, and 51 subjects remained in the placebo arm for weeks 1 to 26. A total of 
16 observation records were excluded from the analysis dataset; Ten HbA1c observations were excluded 
as they were measured >7 days after the last reported dose; two observations were excluded for 
subjects in the placebo group that were re-randomized to treatment and had their HbA1c measured 
greater than one day after the start of empagliflozin at week 26; and four subjects were excluded 
because they had no post-baseline HbA1c records. 
Methods – Population pharmacokinetic model 
The previous model was a two-compartment model with sequential zero-order and first-order absorption 
was used, based upon the results of previous analyses. The model was parameterized with CL/F, V2/F, 
apparent (oral) intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), apparent peripheral volume of distribution after oral 
dosing (V3/F), absorption rate constant (ka) and zero order absorption duration (D1). Interindividual 
variability (IIV) on CL/F and V3/F was estimated. Weight (WT) was used to scale clearances and volumes 
according to fixed allometric exponents between adult and paediatric subjects. Sex, race and eGFR on 
CL/F were covariates in this model.  
This structural model was re-estimated using the data from study 1218-0091 under a Bayesian 
framework. The final model was fit using the no U-turn sampling (NUTS) method in NONMEM with four 
chains of 5000 warmup and 1000 sampling iterations. The parameter estimates from the previous 
empagliflozin population PK model were used as priors to inform the model parameters without direct 
support from the sparse paediatric data. For parameters of primary interest, namely CL/F, apparent 
central volume of distribution after oral dosing (V2/F), and CL/F by sex, weakly informative priors were 
used. All parameter estimates were reported as point estimates from NONMEM® with 95% credible 
intervals, derived from the posterior distribution of the parameter estimates. Additional effects for 
covariates were explored graphically and estimated as necessary to explain potential biases in the 
characterization of PK observed in the paediatric population. 
Covariates in the previous model, including the effects of sex, race and eGFR on CL/F and fixed allometric 
bodyweight effects on CL/F, V2/F, Q/F and V3/F, were retained in the final model, and no additional 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 17/60 
 
 
 
 
covariates were included. The IIV on V3/F was estimated to be highly correlated with CL/F IIV due to the 
limited number of PK observations available in the distribution phase. Therefore, the final model only 
included IIV on CL/F using an exponential variance model. The residual error model was also adjusted to 
include two separate additive residual error terms with one for outlier PK trough observations, which was 
defined as concentrations that were 7 times larger than the expected paediatric concentration 24 hours 
post dose at steady state. The residual error was described using a combined proportional and additive 
error model for normal observations and an additive error model for observation outliers. 
Results - Population pharmacokinetic model 
A visual predictive check, in which paediatric data of study 1218-0091 was simulated, using the previous 
population pharmacokinetic model is provided in Figure 1. The data indicated an underprediction of 
empagliflozin concentrations at both 10 and 25 mg dose levels.

shaded areas represent 90% prediction intervals for median (grey) or 10th / 90th percentiles for data 
simulated under the model. Circles represent the observed data. 
The previous population pharmacokinetic model was then re-estimated using a Bayesian approach, but 
found to result in unrealistic paediatric CL/F values. The reason was investigated and pinpointed towards 
the age covariate effect in the adult model, for which there was no support by the paediatric age range. 
Therefore, the age covariate was removed from the model. This resulted in the final population 
pharmacokinetic model, which was deemed to provide a reasonable description of the data as indicated 
by visual inspection of model diagnostics (Figure 2), plausibility of parameter estimates and their 
precision.

Methods – Exposure-Response analysis 
An exposure-response model was previously developed for longitudinal HbA1c using adult data. This 
model consisted of a turnover model parameterised with HbA1c synthesis rate constant (kin) and HbA1c 
degradation rate constant (kout), with empagliflozin inhibiting the kin parameter through an inhibitory 
maximum effect (Emax) relationship, and a placebo effect incorporated on the kout parameter, to 
describe the change in HbA1c over time in relation with empagliflozin exposure. Baseline HbA1c and eGFR 
were included as covariates on Imax, and Imax was estimated to increase with increasing baseline HbA1c

and increasing eGFR, based upon priors from the previously estimated model. Insulin was also included 
as a covariate, and insulin co-therapy at baseline was associated with a higher baseline HbA1c and a 
faster disease progression. Inter-individual variability (IIV) was included on baseline HbA1c and the 
disease progression parameter. A proportional residual error was also included.  
This exposure-response model was re-estimated for the new paediatric data from study 1218-0091 
using full Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian estimation methods, with prior distributions defined 
from the point estimates and uncertainty of the adult exposure-response model for model parameters 
without direct support from the paediatric data. The AUCss was simulated for paediatric subjects with PK 
observations to drive the exposure-response model using their individual pharmacokinetic parameter 
estimates. The estimate of area under the concentration-time curve at 50% of the maximum effect 
(AUC50) was fixed to the same value the previous adult model had been fixed at. The effects of 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and baseline HbA1c on Imax were estimated with an 
informative prior while all other parameters were estimated with weakly informative priors. Additional 
effects for covariates were explored graphically and estimated as necessary to explain potential biases in 
the characterization of HbA1c observed in the paediatric population.  
Exposure-response model 
The placebo response was not captured by the previous adult model; the simulations predicted a flat or 
downward trend over time, while the observed data increased over time (Figure 3). The simulations were 
underpredictive at the 10th, median and 90th percentiles. The treated cohort exhibited a similar trend, 
where the simulations underpredicted the observed data overall. This indicated that the previous adult 
turnover, placebo and drug effect model parameterizations were not adequate for the Study 1218-0091 
paediatric patients.  
Figure 3. Visual Predictive Check – previous model 
This analysis initially began by re-estimating this model using data from Study 1218-0091 in a Bayesian 
framework. The previous model estimate for the placebo effect was 5.16 (4.25, 6.07) (median, 95% CI), 
corresponding to the typical reduction in HbA1c relative to that patient’s baseline. However, as this stood 
in contrast with the paediatric data where there was an increase in HbA1c over time, the placebo model 
was adjusted to capture paediatric disease progression observed with increasing HbA1c over time.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/542987/2023 
Page 21/60 
 
 
 
 
 
To capture the observed increases in HbA1c over time, a time-dependent change in the synthesis process 
was used (i.e., increase of HbA1c) over time. Specifically, the synthesis rate (kin) changed over time by a 
zero-order process. During model development the disease progression term was parameterized in terms 
of separate parameters conditional on background insulin therapy status. The estimate for patients not 
requiring insulin consistently pushed towards zero. Subsequently, this parameter was dropped, and the 
disease progression parameter was only applied to patients requiring background insulin data. 
The previous model estimated the covariate effects of eGFR and baseline HbA1c on Imax; these were 
retained in the current model and estimated using informative priors. The previous model also included 
the effects of baseline metformin, insulin, and sulfonylurea cotherapy on the placebo response parameter. 
There were no pediatric patients who received sulfonylureas, and only 10 subjects who didn’t receive 
background metformin therapy (four active treatment and six placebo patients). Consequently, neither 
covariate effect was included in the final model as their limited availability in the current dataset 
precluded their estimation. The final model only included the effect of receiving insulin co-therapy on the 
disease progression parameter (zero-order disease progression rate constant. Similarly, the previous 
model had also included the effects of age, weight, eGFR, race, gender, and background therapy 
(metformin, insulin, and sulfonylureas) on baseline HbA1c. Due to the limitations stated above with 
respect to the number of reference patients not on metformin or sulfonlyureas, these background 
medication effects were also removed from baseline HbA1c. The age, weight, eGFR, race, and gender 
covariate effects on baseline HbA1c were also removed from the model. This was for two primary 
reasons, first, many of these covariate effects were negligible in the previous model; either their point 
estimates were near the null value and/or their 95% CIs included the null value. Secondly, The EDA also 
did not indicate any trends or imbalances across these covariates with respect to baseline HbA1c. Thus, it 
was concluded that their exclusion from the model, would not impact the estimation of our parameter of 
interest, Imax, and the final model only included the effect of receiving insulin co-therapy on baseline 
HbA1c. The weakly informative prior variance for kout, baseline HbA1c, and the effect of insulin on 
baseline HbA1c were set to 0.1, as the planned weakly informative variance of 1 was too wide and 
allowed non-physiologic samples for the parameters. pcVPCs and model parameters are displayed in 
Figure 4 and Table 7.

Simulations 
Pediatric and adult patients with T2DM showed comparable CL/F estimates, which resulted in comparable 
AUCss values for both populations following Monte Carlo simulations (Figure 5, Table 8). 
Figure 5. Simulated paediatric exposure in study 1218-0091 and 1245.87 versus adult exposure 
Table 8. Comparison of AUCss values from Monte Carlo simulations in adults and pediatric patients 
To compare the exposure-response between paediatrics and adults, Monte Carlo simulations were 
performed from the previous model for 1000 adult patients and from the current model for 1000 
paediatric patients with T2DM (Figure 6 and Table 4). Overall, placebo-adjusted change from baseline in 
the paediatric population decreased with a larger magnitude than in the adult population. This is primarily 
due to higher renal function in paediatrics, as the covariate effect of eGFR on Imax produces a higher 
overall drug effect with increased renal filtration. Overall, insulin cotherapy was associated with a larger 
simulated magnitude of placebo-adjusted change from baseline in paediatric patients, whereas adults had 
comparable placebo-adjusted change from baseline independent of insulin background requirements.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the population pharmacokinetic analysis was appropriately conducted.  
The analysis was based on a previously conducted population pharmacokinetic analysis already assessed 
and accepted in procedure EMEA/H/C/002677/P46. This model was updated using a Bayesian approach 
with study data of 1218-0091. Prior, where applicable, and posterior distributions were compared as 
model diagnostic. The visual predictive check of the previously developed population pharmacokinetic 
model on this new dataset showed some deviations between the model predictions and observations. This 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/542987/2023 
Page 25/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was attributed to the age effect that was included in the adult model. The age effect was shown to be 
only applicable for the adult range. Without this age effect, the population pharmacokinetic model 
performed adequately and can be used to compare the plasma exposure between paediatrics and adult 
patients.  
The exposure comparison indicated no large differences when comparing the overall paediatric and adult 
populations. As allometric scaling using fixed exponents is used in the population pharmacokinetic model, 
an approximate 50% higher exposure can be expected for a patient with a bodyweight of 40 kg compared 
to a patient with a bodyweight of 70 kg. At weights of 45 kg, 70 kg, 95 kg, and 120 kg the median 
normalized steady state AUC, relative to a 70 kg individual was 1.39, 1.0, 0.795, and 0.667, respectively.  
More adjustments to the adult exposure-response model were needed to describe the paediatric patients 
of study 1218-0091, but this appeared to be mainly limited to a different placebo response in paediatric 
patients. In addition, paediatric patients requiring insulin showed higher HbA1c baseline as well as a more 
pronounced disease progression. This resulted in a larger magnitude of simulated placebo-adjusted 
change of HbA1c in pediatric patients requiring insulin. 
Due to differences in the placebo-effect and/or disease progression between adult and paediatric patients, 
the observed difference in placebo-corrected HbA1c treatment effects between adult and paediatric 
patients should be carefully interpreted.  
At weights of 45 kg, 70 kg, 95 kg, and 120 kg, the median normalized placebo adjusted changes from 
baseline in HbA1c were 1.05, 1.00, 0.957, and 0.919 respectively. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The analyses described in this section are considered supportive as efficacy and safety in paediatric 
patients aged 10 years and older were investigated in study 1218-0091. The results of study 1245.87 
were previously assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/002677/P46, where it was concluded that the exposure 
is similar between paediatric and adult T2DM patients. Similarity in exposure can also be concluded in this 
procedure.  
Overall, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been appropriately investigated by the 
Applicant.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
The paediatric PK/PD trial 1245.87 showed that, following a single oral dose of empagliflozin 5 mg, 10 
mg, or 25 mg, paediatric patients with T2DM had similar exposure-response relationships to those of 
adults with T2DM after accounting for significant covariates. 
In adults, empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg once daily are the approved doses for patients with T2DM. 
Taking into account the consistent PK profile and the comparable exposure-response relationship of 
empagliflozin in children and adolescents versus adults and based on the various analyses for the 
individual empagliflozin doses for trial 1218.91 based on TG1, TG2, TG3, TG4, and TG7 the efficacy and 
safety data from trials 1245.87 and 1218.91 support 10 mg empagliflozin once daily as recommended 
starting dose for children from 10 to ≤17 years of age. In patients tolerating empagliflozin 10 mg once 
daily and requiring additional glycaemic control, the dose can be increased to 25 mg once daily.

2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study 
DINAMO 1281-0091: A phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin and linagliptin over 26 weeks, with a double-blind active 
treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks, in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus  
Methods 
Study participants 
Although this report focuses on data for empagliflozin compared with placebo, the entire patient 
population is described in this section including the linagliptin group to provide the characteristics of all 
patients in this trial. 
Trial 1218.91 was carried out at 78 clinical sites in 13 countries in Asia, Europe, North and South 
America. In total, 158 patients were randomised to double-blind linagliptin (53 patients), empagliflozin 
pooled (52 patients), or placebo (53 patients) once daily treatment. The initial randomisation was 
stratified by age and sex. The re-randomisations at Week 14 and Week 26 were stratified by the age 
documented at the initial randomisation. All but 1 randomised patient (linagliptin group, withdrawal from 
trial) were treated with at least 1 dose of trial medication.  
The majority of patients (140 patients, 89.2%) completed the planned observation time of 55 weeks 
(regardless of completion of planned treatment with trial medication). The majority of patients remained 
on treatment with trial drug up to Week 26 (140 patients, 89.2%) and up to Week 52 (130 patients, 
82.8%). The frequencies of patients with premature treatment discontinuations were generally 
comparable across treatment groups. The most common reason for premature discontinuation of trial 
medication was withdrawal by patient (Week 26: 10 patients, 6.4%; Week 52: 16 patients, 10.2%). 
Based on TG6 (complete active treatment period excluding placebo), the median exposure to active trial 
medication up to Week 52 was 362 days (about 12 months; min: 1 day, max: 393 days), with 58.3% of 
patients treated for at least 46 weeks with active trial medication. 
As intended, between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were <15 years of age (i.e. 76 patients, 
48.4%) and between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were female (i.e. 97 patients, 61.8%). The 
mean age of the patient population was 14.5 years (SD 1.9). More than half of the patient population 
participated in North America (mostly USA). Most patients were White (78 patients, 49.7%) or 
Black/African American (49 patients, 31.2%).  
About half of the patients (80 patients, 51.0%) took only metformin, 63 patients (40.1%) took metformin 
plus insulin, and 5 patients (3.2%) had only insulin as background antidiabetic medication, with balanced 
distribution across treatment groups. Thus, the majority of the treated patients in trial 1218.91 (91.1%, 
143 of 157) took metformin as background antidiabetic medication at baseline.  
Patients with insufficient glycaemic control of HbA1c ≥6.5% and ≤10.5% could participate in this trial. 
About half of the patients had baseline HbA1c values of <8% (83 patients, 52.9); for the remaining 
patients, approximately similar proportions had either HbA1c values of 8.0% to 9.0% (40 patients, 
25.5%) or of >9% (34 patients, 21.7%). The mean baseline FPG was 158.70 mg/dL (SD 55.56). As per 
the inclusion criteria, patients had to be negative for both islet cell antigen auto-antibodies and glutamic 
acid decarboxylase auto-antibodies. Most patients had been diagnosed with T2DM for 1 to 3 years

(66 patients, 42.0%). The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2 (SD 8.33). The mean body weight was 99.92 kg 
(SD 26.78), with a maximum weight of 171.0 kg observed in this paediatric population. The mean fasting 
C-peptide values at baseline were 0.9932 nmol/L. The mean eGFR was 129.79 mL/min/1.73 m2. Normal 
UACR (<30 mg/g crea) was reported for 73.9% of patients, while 21.0% of patients had 
microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/g crea) and 3.8% had macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/g crea). The 
modified Tanner staging was used to assess the patient’s pubertal stage; a total of 93 patients (59.2%) 
had a Tanner stage of 5 (i.e. fully developed) and 64 patients (40.8%) had a Tanner stage of 2 to 4 (i.e. 
partially developed). Demographic and clinical characteristics were generally balanced between the 
randomised treatment groups. 
Treatments 
There were 3 treatment arms for this trial: 
• 
placebo,  
•  5 mg linagliptin 
•  10 mg empagliflozin 
Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c <7.0% at Week 12 (i.e. non-responders) were re-
randomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg empagliflozin or increase to 25 mg empagliflozin.

Proportion of patients who initiate glycaemic rescue therapy up to 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Any 
new antidiabetic therapy, any dose increase of basal insulin of more than 0.1 IU/kg above the 
baseline prescribed dose for more than 21 consecutive days was considered rescue therapy 
•  Change in fasting serum C-peptide from baseline to the end of 26 and 52 weeks 
•  Change in urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) (mg/g creatinine) from baseline to the end of 26 
and 52 weeks

•  Change in HbA1c (%) from Week 12 to the end of 26 weeks in patients randomised to 
empagliflozin 10 mg and not achieving glycaemic target at Week 12  
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was analysed based on an ANCOVA model using multiple imputation with 
consecutive ‘wash-out’ (primary hypotheses for TG1; see Figure 7 box with dashed red borderline) and 
‘inverse probability weighting’ approaches (secondary hypotheses for TG2 and TG3; see Figure 7 box with 
dashed red borderline). The ‘wash-out’ approach imputed missing off-treatment values in active 
treatment groups based on the primary endpoint distribution in the placebo group. The hypotheses were 
tested hierarchically in a confirmatory setting. The primary family of hypotheses consisted of 2 pairwise 
comparisons of the treatment effect of empagliflozin pooled doses versus placebo and linagliptin versus 
placebo (TG1), followed by the secondary family of hypothesis comparing the effect of each empagliflozin 
dose regimen with placebo (TG2 and TG3). To test the primary hypotheses, the effect of linagliptin and of 
empagliflozin was compared with placebo at an overall α of 0.05 (2-sided) using the Hochberg method to 
account for multiple testing. Only after achieving statistically significant results for both comparisons in 
the ‘wash-out’ approach, were the secondary hypotheses (ANCOVA with ‘wash-out’ plus ‘inverse 
probability weighting’ approach) tested to compare the individual empagliflozin doses versus placebo.

Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses were based on the mITT set and included all treated patients 
who had a baseline HbA1c value. Patients were analysed as randomised and including all HbA1c 
measurements regardless of adherence to treatment or the use of rescue medication. 
Baseline was defined as the last observed measurement prior to administration of any initially randomised 
trial medication at Day 1.

Results 
Primary confirmatory endpoint 
The hierarchical testing results for DINAMO are shown in Figure 8. Based on TG1 (box with dashed red 
borderline) , the treatment effect of linagliptin 5 mg compared with placebo was not statistically 
significant, while the effect of empagliflozin treatment (pooled) was clinically meaningful and statistically 
superior to placebo in lowering HbA1c from baseline after 26 weeks (Table 10). Since the primary 
hypotheses based on TG1 could not be both rejected, the hierarchical testing for TG2 and TG3 was not 
continued. These analyses were considered exploratory, and the p-values regarded as nominal (Table 
10).

Figure 8 
Hierarchical testing results, trial 1218.91 
Based on TG2 (box with dashed red borderline in Table 10), empagliflozin 10 mg as a starting dose 
titrated to 25 mg due to insufficient glycaemic control after 12 weeks or remaining at 10 mg for those 
with sufficient glycaemic control suggested a clinically meaningful placebo-corrected numerical reduction 
in HbA1c of −0.52% (95% CI: −1.31% to 0.27%) at Week 26, although the effect had a nominal p-value 
of 0.1943. In both prespecified sensitivity analyses for TG2, one using MMRM with no multiple imputation 
or adjusted weighting and another for only patients compliant with the clinical trial protocol, the 
treatment effect estimates for empagliflozin in TG2 were larger and nominally significant compared with 
placebo (Figure 9).  
Based on TG3 (box with dashed red borderline in Table 10), empagliflozin 10 mg as a starting dose and 
staying at 10 mg regardless of glycaemic control after 12 weeks suggested a clinically meaningful and

The change in HbA1c [%] from Week 12 to the end of 26 weeks in patients randomised to empagliflozin 
10 mg and not at glycaemic target (HbA1c <7.0%) at Week 12 was a further endpoint. Based on 
descriptive analysis (OC-AD), the mean (SD) change from Week 12 to 26 for patients titrated to 10 mg 
was −0.10% (0.71) and for those titrated to 25 mg 0.52% (0.63). 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint showed results consistent with the primary analyses (Figure 
9).

Using TG7, the changes in HbA1c from Week 26 to 52 were analysed for patients initially randomised to 
placebo and re-randomised at Week 26 to linagliptin 5 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg, or empagliflozin 25 mg 
(Table 11). The number of patients was relatively low in each group (15 or 16 patients). The mean (SD) 
change at Week 52 for empagliflozin 10 mg was −0.35% (1.50) and for empagliflozin 25 mg −0.53% 
(1.13), indicating a numerical benefit for patients treated with either dose of empagliflozin.

Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
For empagliflozin pooled vs placebo, a trend towards a larger HbA1c reduction in patients with higher 
baseline HbA1c or FPG was observed. Also, the subgroup with time since diagnosis of T2DM of 1 to 3 years 
appeared to show a larger treatment effect than the other 2 subgroups. The primary analysis results were 
consistent across the rest of the subgroups. Efficacy was similar for individuals aged <15 and individuals 
aged >15-18 years.

In the placebo group, mean HbA1c increased over the 26 weeks by 0.68%, indicating rapid disease 
progression despite that the majority of patients (94.3%) had background metformin and/or insulin 
treatment at baseline. The reduction in HbA1c in the empagliflozin pooled group was apparent at the first 
assessment (Week 4) and the difference to placebo was constant up to Week 26. From Week 26 to 52, no 
control using placebo was available due to the trial design; the trend in the empagliflozin pooled group 
was consistent with that from Week 12 to 26 (Figure 12).

Glycaemic rescue therapy 
The use of rescue therapy was defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria:  
•  Any new addition of antidiabetic therapy introduced after the first dose of study treatment 
•  Any total daily dose increase of basal insulin of more than 0.1 IU/kg above the baseline 
prescribed dose for more than 21 consecutive days 
Up to Week 26, the proportion of patients who initiated glycaemic rescue therapy was comparable 
between placebo (6 patients, 11.3%) and empagliflozin pooled (5 patients, 9.6%). Up to Week 52 (long-
term analysis for the active substances based on the initial randomisation), 6 patients (11.5%) in the 
empagliflozin pooled group initiated glycaemic rescue therapy. 
FPG, body weight, SBP, and DBP  
All secondary endpoints were exploratory; a summary of the results is provided in Table 12. The trend for 
changes in FPG was consistent with HbA1c. For empagliflozin, a clinically meaningful and nominally 
significant lowering of FPG was observed.  
No obvious changes over time in body weight, SBP, and DBP were observed for empagliflozin pooled 
versus placebo (Table 12).In addition, no obvious changes over time in fasting serum C peptide, UACR, or 
eGFR were observed for any treatment group in this trial.

Design 
Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and parallel group trial with 
3 treatment arms (placebo, 5 mg linagliptin, 10 mg empagliflozin) lasting 
26 weeks. Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c <7.0% at 
Week 12 were re-randomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg 
empagliflozin or increase to 25 mg empagliflozin. The trial included a 
double-blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks: 
patients on placebo were re-randomised at Week 26 to receive either 
linagliptin or empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Phase 3 trial design 
Trial 1218.91 (DINAMO) was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial 
with 3 treatment arms (placebo, 5 mg linagliptin, 10 mg empagliflozin) lasting 26 weeks in children from 
10 to ≤17 years of age. The design is complex, but acceptable, because answered the call from 
regulators and experts for multi-arm efficacy and safety studies in paediatric patients, given the 
challenges of recruitment in this population. 
Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c <7.0% at Week 12 (i.e. non responders) were re-
randomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg empagliflozin or increase to 25 mg empagliflozin. 
The trial also included a double-blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks: patients 
on placebo were re-randomised at Week 26 to receive either linagliptin or empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 
mg).  
Patients 
In total, 158 patients were randomised to double-blind linagliptin (53 patients), empagliflozin pooled (52 
patients), or placebo (53 patients) once daily treatment. The majority of patients remained on treatment 
with trial drug up to Week 26 (140 patients, 89.2%) and up to Week 52 (130 patients, 82.8%).The 
frequencies of patients with premature treatment discontinuations were generally comparable across 
treatment groups. 
As intended, between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were <15 years of age (i.e. 76 patients, 
48.4%) and between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were female (i.e. 97 patients, 61.8%). The 
mean age of the patient population was 14.5 years (SD 1.9).About half of the patients (80 patients, 
51.0%) took only metformin, 63 patients (40.1%) took metformin plus insulin, and 5 patients (3.2%) had 
only insulin as background antidiabetic medication, with balanced distribution across treatment groups.

Although the study was done in multiple geographic regions (North America, South America, Europe, and 
Asia), most participants were enrolled in the Americas, which limits generalizability to the broader 
worldwide population of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes.  
About half of the patients had baseline HbA1c values of <8% (83 patients, 52.9); for the remaining 
patients, approximately similar proportions had either HbA1c values of 8.0% to 9.0% (40 patients, 
25.5%) or of >9% (34 patients, 21.7%). The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2 (SD 8.33). The mean body 
weight was 99.92 kg (SD 26.78), with a maximum weight of 171.0 kg observed in this paediatric 
population.  
Several subgroups may be too small to establish efficacy.  
HbA1c: primary outcome 
For the primary outcome, the adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline at week 26 was –0.84 % [-9.2 
mmol/mol] in the empagliflozin pooled group versus placebo (95% CI -1.50 to –0.19 (-16.4 to -2.1]; 
p=0.012); the corresponding change from baseline for linagliptin versus placebo was –0.34% [-3.8 
mmol/mol; 95% CI—0.99 to 0.30 [-10.8 to 3.3]; p=0.29). 
HbA1c: 10 mg vs 25 mg 
The weighted adjusted mean change in HbA1c values at week 26 in the dosing regimen up-titrating non-
responders to empagliflozin 25 mg was -0.52% [-5.7 mmol/mol] versus the placebo group (95% C, -1.31 
to 0.27 [-14.3 to 2.9]; p=0.19). The corresponding change from baseline in those who remained on 10 
mg was -1.18% [-12.9 mmol/mol; 95% Cl -1.90 to -0.45 [-20.8 to -4.9]; p=0.0015).  
The change in HbA1c [%] from Week 12 to the end of 26 weeks in patients randomised to empagliflozin 
10 mg and not at glycaemic target (HbA1c <7.0%) at Week 12 was a further endpoint. Based on 
descriptive analysis (OC-AD), the mean (SD) change from Week 12 to 26 for patients titrated to 10 mg 
was −0.10% (0.71, n=10) and for those titrated to 25 mg +0.52% (0.63, n=12). However, the higher 
mean baseline HbA1c value in the 25 mg group and one outlier may explain the disappointing results in 
the 25 mg group.  
The changes in HbA1c from Week 26 to 52 were also analysed for patients initially randomised to placebo 
and re-randomised at Week 26 to linagliptin 5 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg, or empagliflozin 25 mg. The 
number of patients was relatively low in each group (15 or 16 patients). The mean (SD) change at Week 
52 for empagliflozin 10 mg was −0.35% (1.50) and for empagliflozin 25 mg −0.53% (1.13).  
HbA1c: subgroups 
As could be expected, a trend towards a larger HbA1c reduction in patients with higher baseline HbA1c or 
FPG was observed for empagliflozin pooled vs placebo. Importantly, the subgroup with time since 
diagnosis of T2DM of 1 to 3 years appeared to show a larger treatment effect than the other 2 subgroups. 
2 patients with HbA1c increases >5% were identified as major contributors to the heterogeneity of the 
treatment effects in this subgroup analysis. The primary analysis results were consistent across the rest 
of the subgroups. Efficacy was similar for individuals aged <15 and individuals aged >15-18 years. 
Other endpoints 
At Week 26, the trend for changes in FPG was consistent with HbA1c. No obvious changes over time in 
body weight, SBP, and DBP were observed for empagliflozin pooled versus placebo.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In children from 10 to ≤17 years of age, empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg combined) was associated with 
a clinically relevant decrease in HbA1c compared to placebo. However, the Hba1c change in non-
responders on 10 mg was lower in those uptitrated to empagliflozin 25 mg (+0.52% since re-
randomisation) compared to those who remained on 10 mg (-0.10% since re-randomisation). However, 
the higher mean baseline HbA1c value in the 25 mg group and one outlier may explain the disappointing 
results in the 25 mg group. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In the paediatric programme for empagliflozin, the pivotal trial 1218.91 represented most of the exposure 
with a treatment period of up to 52 weeks. Therefore, the main focus in this section is on trial 1218.91. 
Safety analyses followed the ‘treatment-emergent’ principle and included all treated patients. Unless 
otherwise specified, treatment was assigned as randomised and the analyses of AEs were based on the 
number of patients with AEs. AE analyses were restricted to on-treatment AEs, defined as AEs with an 
onset date between the first trial medication intake and 7 days after the last intake, unless otherwise 
stated. Exposure-adjusted AEs were also displayed as incidence rates per 100 patient-years. 
Adverse events 
The main analysis of safety in trial 1218.91 focused on TG1 up to Week 26 (box with dashed red 
borderline in Table 14), for a randomised, placebo-controlled comparison. Up to Week 26, the rate of any 
AE in the empagliflozin pooled group was slightly higher than on placebo, while the rates of severe AEs, 
AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and SAEs were generally comparable with the rates on 
placebo (Table 14).

Most frequently reported AEs in trial 1218.91 
Up to Week 26, the most frequently reported AEs for patients on placebo were headache (7 patients, 
13.2%) and hypoglycaemia, vitamin D deficiency, and diarrhoea (each reported for 5 patients, 9.4%). In 
the empagliflozin pooled group, the most frequently reported AEs by PT were hypoglycaemia (11 patients, 
21.2%), headache (8 patients, 15.4%), and vitamin D deficiency (5 patients, 9.6%). The only imbalance 
in rates of AEs by PT between the placebo and empagliflozin was in the rate of hypoglycaemia, which was 
higher on empagliflozin than on placebo. For other AEs, by PT, there were no relevant differences in rates 
for placebo compared with the empagliflozin pooled group. 
From Week 26 to 52, no control using placebo was available due to the trial design. Up to Week 52, the 
rates and pattern of AEs reported for the empagliflozin active pooled group (by SOC and PT) were 
comparable with the rates of AEs reported up to Week 26 for the empagliflozin pooled group. 
Adverse events by intensity 
Up to Week 26, almost all AEs in the placebo and empagliflozin pooled groups were of mild or moderate 
intensity. Severe AEs were reported for 2 patients (3.8%) on placebo and 1 patient (1.9%) in the 
empagliflozin pooled group. In the empagliflozin pooled group, the severe AE suicidal ideation was also an 
SAE (see below); it was not considered to be drug related. Up to Week 52, the rates of AEs by severity in

the empagliflozin active pooled group were generally comparable with rates in the empagliflozin pooled 
group at Week 26. 
Drug-related adverse events 
Up to Week 26, on the PT level, few drug-related AEs were reported by >1 patient and there was no 
relevant difference between placebo and the empagliflozin pooled group. On placebo, hypoglycaemia was 
reported for 2 patients (3.8%). Drug-related AEs reported for >1 patient in the empagliflozin pooled 
group were hypoglycaemia (4 patients, 7.7%), fungal infection and increased blood ketone body (each 
reported for 2 patients, 3.8%). Up to Week 52, the rates of drug-related AEs in the empagliflozin active 
pooled group were generally comparable with rates in the empagliflozin pooled group at Week 26. 
AEs leading to discontinuation 
Up to Week 26, there were no AEs leading to discontinuation of patients in the empagliflozin pooled group 
and 2 patients (3.8%) discontinued from placebo (PTs: acute pancreatitis, polyuria, and irregular 
menstruation, each reported for 1 patient [1.9%]). Up to Week 52, the rates of AEs leading to 
discontinuation in the empagliflozin pooled group were generally comparable with rates at Week 26 in the 
empagliflozin active pooled group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There was no relevant difference among treatment groups with regard to SAEs reported during this trial. 
Up to Week 26, 2 patients (3.8%) in each group (placebo and empagliflozin pooled) had SAEs. Up to 
Week 52, 3 patients (3.6%) in the empagliflozin active pooled group had SAEs. No patient had a fatal AE. 
Two patients had SAEs that were considered to be life-threatening: 1 patient on placebo (up to Week 26), 
who had 6 such SAEs (PTs: acute pancreatitis [onset Day 24], and systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, and hypovolaemic shock; 
all with an onset on Day 25), and 1 patient on empagliflozin, who was included in both the summary of 
SAEs up to Week 26 (empagliflozin pooled group) and up to Week 52 (empagliflozin active pooled group). 
For the patient on empagliflozin, the PT was suicidal ideation; this event was not considered to be drug 
related and occurred in a patient with a history of suicidal ideation of >5 years at trial entry.  
Up to Week 52, no SAE (on the PT level) was reported for >1 patient in either treatment group. Two SAEs 
were considered to be related to trial medication: hyperglycaemia (1 patient on placebo) and 
tubulointerstitial nephritis (1 patient on empagliflozin 10 mg). The event of tubulointerstitial nephritis led 
to interruption of trial treatment rather than discontinuation; the patient recovered. Also, 4 days before 
the onset of this event, the patient had colitis with vomiting and diarrhoea, and received ciprofloxacin, 
metronidazole, and ibuprofen as treatment. 
Two patients discontinued trial medication due to SAEs: acute pancreatitis (1 patient on placebo, 
medication code broken) and tubulointerstitial nephritis (1 patient on empagliflozin 10 mg, mentioned 
above; the medication was interrupted rather than discontinued). 
Laboratory findings 
Hepatic and renal laboratory parameters were evaluated as part of the AESI evaluation, and no relevant 
differences were observed for empagliflozin pooled compared with placebo. In the analysis of hepatic 
laboratory parameters (up to Week 26), the frequency of patients with elevated liver enzyme values was 
balanced between placebo and empagliflozin pooled. Two patients on empagliflozin pooled had elevated 
ALT and/or AST ≥3x upper limit of normal; both patients had already elevated liver enzyme values before

first intake of trial medication. None of the patients in trial 1218.91 fulfilled the criteria for potential Hy’s 
Law. 
There were no notable changes in total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglyceride values from baseline to Week 26 in either treatment group (placebo 
or empagliflozin pooled) or to Week 52 for the empagliflozin pooled group. There were also no relevant 
differences between the treatment groups. 
There were no notable changes in IGF-1, IGF-BP3 and markers of bone turnover from baseline to Week 
26 in either treatment group (placebo or empagliflozin pooled) or up to Week 52 for the empagliflozin 
pooled group. There were also no relevant differences between the treatment groups. NTx, P1NP, IGF-1, 
and IGF-BP3 were analysed in subgroups according to sex and Tanner staging score at baseline. There 
were no relevant differences between treatment groups in subgroup analyses by sex and baseline Tanner 
score. 
For other safety laboratory parameters, differences between placebo and empagliflozin were consistent 
with the known safety profile of empagliflozin. Mean values for uric acid were decreased from baseline to 
Week 26 in the empagliflozin pooled group compared with baseline values, and haematocrit and 
haemoglobin values were increased. However, there were no notable differences with regard to 
frequencies of PCSAs between placebo and empagliflozin pooled. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Up to Week 26, the rate of any AE in the empagliflozin pooled group was slightly higher than on placebo, 
while the rates of severe AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and SAEs were generally 
comparable with the rates on placebo. 
Up to Week 26, no AEs were leading to discontinuation of patients in the empagliflozin pooled group and 
2 patients (3.8%) discontinued from placebo (PTs: acute pancreatitis, polyuria, and irregular 
menstruation, each reported for 1 patient [1.9%]).  There was no relevant difference among treatment 
groups with regard to SAEs reported during this trial. Up to Week 26, 2 patients (3.8%) in each group 
(placebo and empagliflozin pooled) had SAEs. Up to Week 52, 3 patients (3.6%) in the empagliflozin 
active pooled group had SAEs. No patient had a fatal AE. Two patients had SAEs that were considered to 
be life-threatening: 1 patient on placebo and 1 patient on empagliflozin (suicidal ideation). 
Two patients discontinued trial medication due to SAEs: acute pancreatitis (1 patient on placebo, 
medication code broken) and tubulointerstitial nephritis (1 patient on empagliflozin). The results of the 
AESIs and specific AEs were consistent with the known safety profile of empagliflozin in patients with 
T2DM. Up to Week 26, there were few patients with the following AESIs, and no imbalances in rates 
between placebo and the empagliflozin pooled group: hypersensitivity reactions, pancreatitis, hepatic 
injury, decreased renal function, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), ketone measurements reported as AE, 
genital infection, arthralgia, and volume depletion. For DKA, there was no patient in the empagliflozin 
(active) pooled group who was reported with DKA. 
For hypoglycaemic events, up to Week 26, there were higher overall rates for patients in the 
empagliflozin pooled group compared with placebo, but no relevant difference among treatment groups 
with regard to rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. There were no severe hypoglycaemia events. 
However, there was an increased risk of hypoglycaemia in patients using insulin as a background (14.3 
vs. 32.0) as well as in patients without insulin background (6.3 vs. 14.8). There were no relevant 
differences between placebo and empagliflozin pooled with regard to heart rate and growth assessments 
(weight, height, BMI, and growth velocity). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/542987/2023

There were no relevant safety differences (including hypoglycaemia) between empagliflozin 10 and 25 
mg.  
Long-term safety data is currently missing, but the MAH has made a commitment to ensure close 
monitoring of long-term safety via future PSURs, which is acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In paediatric patients, no unexpected safety concerns were identified for empagliflozin (pooled doses) 
with regard to AEs, drug-related AEs, AESIs, safety laboratory parameters, and other safety parameters 
assessed in the paediatric programme. Only for hypoglycaemic events, there were higher overall rates for 
patients in the empagliflozin pooled group compared with placebo. There were no relevant safety 
differences (including hypoglycaemia) between empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg. Long-term safety data in the 
paediatric population needs to be added as missing information in the summary of safety concerns 
section of the empaglifozin PSUR and systematically reported in all upcoming PSURs. The MAH has made 
a commitment in this regard, which is acceptable. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
make minor editorial changes in the product information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The objective of this variation is to extend the indication of Jardiance for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus in children 10 years and above. As a consequence, the package leaflet is also proposed to be 
updated with the new indication and use in paediatric patients. 
According to the Guidelines on the Readability of the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (revision 1, 12 January 2009) it is possible to refer to already approved package leaflets 
for which results of readability testing are available. The package leaflet for Jardiance was subject to a 
readability user testing with the intial marketing authorisation application. Further, with the indication 
extension for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EMEA/H/C/002677/II/0055) a readablity user 
test was conducted. In the final report dated February 2021, the package leaflet was rated readable and 
comprehensive. No further improvement was deemed necessary per this recent report. During procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002677/II/0055, the package leaflet was updated based on CHMP’s request to ensure patient’s 
understanding in the contexts of the side effect ‘diabetic ketoacidosis’. 
With this proposed indication extension, the update of the package leaflet only concerns sections 1. ‘What 
Jardiance is used for’ and ‘Children and adolesents’. The design and layout of the printed package leaflet 
will not change. 
In conclusion, given that a readability user test was conducted recently and that changes to be introduced

for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children 10 years and above are only very limited in e 
tent, Boehringer Ingelheim considers it justified to not consult with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Empagliflozin is an orally administered, potent, and highly selective SGLT-2 inhibitor. Empagliflozin is 
approved and marketed for the treatment of adults with T2DM, for the prevention of CV events in adults 
with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease, and in adults with heart failure independent of left 
ventricular ejection fraction. 
Based on the results of the paediatric clinical programme, the company now intends to seek an indication 
for empagliflozin for the treatment of paediatric patients with T2DM.  
The proposed indication (added text in bold) is : “Jardiance is indicated in for the treatment of adults and 
children aged 10 years and above for the treatment of with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes 
mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
- 
- 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes 
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.” 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The incidence of T2DM in children is increasing worldwide, and the main driver is the increased 
prevalence and degree of childhood obesity. Childhood T2DM is still relatively rare in Europe, with a 
prevalence of approximately 2.5 per 100 thousand. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
As in adults, T2DM in children is characterised by hyperglycaemia driven by insulin resistance and relative 
insulin deficiency. Developing T2DM at a younger age is associated with a considerably higher risk of 
long-term cardiovascular disease compared with those who develop T2DM in the middle age. The rapid 
deterioration in glucose regulation in children as compared with adults may contribute to the greater risk 
for micro- and macrovascular complications in children with T2DM as they develop into adults. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Management of T2DM in children involves lifestyle modifications. Pharmacologic glucose-lowering 
treatment is often necessary, including metformin, insulin, or a combination of both. Several GLP-1 
receptor agonists have already been approved for use in paediatric patients. In addition, the SGLT2 
inhibitor (dapagliflozin) has already been approved for use in paediatric patients aged 10 years and 
above. An ongoing study is investigating the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in children and 
adolescents (>=10 to <18 Years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
PK/PD trial 
Trial 1245.87 was a Phase I randomised, single-dose, parallel-group trial with 3 treatment arms with 1 
dose of empagliflozin each (5 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg).  
Phase 3 trial design 
Trial 1218.91 (DINAMO) was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial 
with 3 treatment arms (placebo, 5 mg linagliptin, 10 mg empagliflozin) lasting 26 weeks in children from 
10 to ≤17 years of age. The design is complex but acceptable because it answered the call for multi-arm 
efficacy and safety studies in paediatric patients, given the challenges of recruitment in this population. 
Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c <7.0% at Week 12 (i.e. non-responders) were re-
randomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg empagliflozin or increased to 25 mg empagliflozin. 
The trial also included a double-blind, active treatment safety extension period of up to 52 weeks: 
patients on placebo were re-randomised at Week 26 to receive either linagliptin or empagliflozin (10 mg 
or 25 mg).  
Patients 
In total, 158 patients were randomised to double-blind linagliptin (53 patients), empagliflozin pooled (52 
patients), or placebo (53 patients) once daily treatment. The majority of patients remained on treatment 
with trial drug up to Week 26 (140 patients, 89.2%) and up to Week 52 (130 patients, 82.8%). The 
frequencies of patients with premature treatment discontinuations were generally comparable across 
treatment groups. 
As intended, between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were <15 years of age (i.e. 76 patients, 
48.4%) and between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were female (i.e. 97 patients, 61.8%). The 
mean age of the patient population was 14.5 years (SD 1.9). About half of the patients (80 patients, 
51.0%) took only metformin, 63 patients (40.1%) took metformin plus insulin, and 5 patients (3.2%) had 
only insulin as background antidiabetic medication, with balanced distribution across treatment groups. 
Although the study was done in multiple geographic regions (North America, South America, Europe, and 
Asia), most participants were enrolled in the Americas, which limits generalizability to the broader 
worldwide population of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes.  
About half of the patients had baseline HbA1c values of <8% (83 patients, 52.9); for the remaining 
patients, approximately similar proportions had either HbA1c values of 8.0% to 9.0% (40 patients, 
25.5%) or of >9% (34 patients, 21.7%). The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2 (SD 8.33). The mean body 
weight was 99.92 kg (SD 26.78), with a maximum weight of 171.0 kg observed in this paediatric 
population.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
HbA1c: primary outcome 
For the primary outcome, the adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline at week 26 was –0.84 % [-9.2 
mmol/mol] in the empagliflozin pooled group versus placebo (95% CI -1.50 to –0.19 (-16.4 to -2.1]; 
p=0.012); the corresponding change from baseline for linagliptin versus placebo was –0.34% [-3.8 
mmol/mol; 95% CI—0.99 to 0.30 [-10.8 to 3.3]; p=0.29).

EMA/542987/2023

Other endpoints 
At Week 26, the trend for changes in FPG was consistent with HbA1c. No apparent changes over time in 
body weight, SBP, and DBP were observed for empagliflozin pooled versus placebo.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
HbA1c: 10 mg vs 25 mg 
The weighted adjusted mean change in HbA1c values at week 26 in the dosing regimen up-titrating non-
responders to empagliflozin 25 mg was -0.52% [-5.7 mmol/mol] versus the placebo group compared to 
baseline (95% C, -1.31 to 0.27 [-14.3 to 2.9]; p=0.19). The corresponding change from baseline in those 
who remained on 10 mg was -1.18% [-12.9 mmol/mol; 95% Cl -1.90 to -0.45 [-20.8 to -4.9]; 
p=0.0015).  
The change in HbA1c [%] from Week 12 to the end of 26 weeks in patients randomised to empagliflozin 
10 mg and not at glycaemic target (HbA1c <7.0%) at Week 12 was a further endpoint. Based on 
descriptive analysis (OC-AD) and small groups, the mean (SD) change from Week 12 to 26 for patients 
titrated to remain on 10 mg was −0.10% (0.71, n=10) and for those titrated to 25 mg was +0.52% 
(0.63, n=12). 
The changes in HbA1c from Week 26 to 52 were also analysed for patients initially randomised to placebo 
and re-randomised at Week 26 to linagliptin 5 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg, or empagliflozin 25 mg. The 
number of patients was relatively low in each group (15 or 16 patients). The mean (SD) change at Week 
52 for empagliflozin 10 mg was −0.35% (1.50) and for empagliflozin 25 mg −0.53% (1.13).  
HbA1c: subgroups 
The primary analysis results were consistent across subgroups. Efficacy was similar for individuals aged 
<15 and individuals aged >15-18 years. However, as expected, a trend towards a larger HbA1c reduction 
in patients with higher baseline HbA1c or FPG was observed for empagliflozin pooled vs placebo. In 
addition, the subgroup with time since diagnosis of T2DM of 1 to 3 years appeared to show a larger 
treatment effect than the other 2 subgroups.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Up to Week 26, the rate of any AE in the empagliflozin pooled group was slightly higher than on placebo, 
while the rates of severe AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and SAEs were generally 
comparable with the rates on placebo. 
Up to Week 26, there were no AEs leading to discontinuation of patients in the empagliflozin pooled group 
and 2 patients (3.8%) discontinued from placebo (PTs: acute pancreatitis, polyuria, and irregular 
menstruation, each reported for 1 patient [1.9%]).  There was no relevant difference among treatment 
groups with regard to SAEs reported during this trial. Up to Week 26, 2 patients (3.8%) in each group 
(placebo and empagliflozin pooled) had SAEs. Up to Week 52, 3 patients (3.6%) in the empagliflozin 
active pooled group had SAEs. No patient had a fatal AE. Two patients had SAEs that were considered to 
be life-threatening: 1 patient on placebo and 1 patient on empagliflozin (suicidal ideation). 
Two patients discontinued trial medication due to SAEs: acute pancreatitis (1 patient on placebo, 
medication code broken) and tubulointerstitial nephritis (1 patient on empagliflozin). The results of the 
AESIs and specific AEs were consistent with the known safety profile of empagliflozin in patients with 
T2DM. Up to Week 26, there were few patients with the following AESIs, and no imbalances in rates 
between placebo and the empagliflozin pooled group: hypersensitivity reactions, pancreatitis, hepatic

injury, decreased renal function, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), ketone measurements reported as AE, 
genital infection, arthralgia, and volume depletion. For DKA, there was no patient in the empagliflozin 
(active) pooled group who was reported with DKA. 
There were no relevant differences between placebo and empagliflozin pooled with regard to heart rate 
and growth assessments (weight, height, BMI, and growth velocity). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
For hypoglycaemic events, up to Week 26, there were remarkably higher overall rates for patients in the 
empagliflozin pooled group compared with placebo (23.1 vs 9.4%), but there were no relevant 
differences among treatment groups with regard to rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. There were no 
severe hypoglycaemia events. 
There were no relevant safety differences between empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg (including 
hypoglycaemia), but the groups were small.  
Only limited safety data up to 52 weeks is available in the paediatric population. Although no new safety 
concerns emerge from the data presented, long-term safety in the paediatric population (aged 10 years 
and above) is missing.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In children from 10 to ≤17 years of age, empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg combined) was associated with 
a clinically relevant decrease in HbA1c compared to placebo. However, the Hba1c change in non-
responders on 10 mg was lower in those uptitrated to empagliflozin 25 mg (+0.52% since re-

randomisation) compared to those who remained on 10 mg (-0.10% since re-randomisation). The 
absence of any additional HbA1c lowering effect of the 25 mg dose is an important issue.  Studies in 
adults have also shown that the added value of the 25 mg dose is very small compared to the 10 mg 
dose. However, the higher mean baseline HbA1c value in the 25 mg group and one outlier may explain 
the disappointing results in the 25 mg group. As there were no relevant differences between empagliflozin 
10 and 25 mg in clinical safety, increasing the dose from 10 to 25 mg may be useful in some patients 
who tolerate the 10 mg dose and have insufficient glycaemic control. 
In paediatric patients, no unexpected safety concerns were identified for empagliflozin (pooled doses) 
with regard to AEs, drug-related AEs, AESIs, safety laboratory parameters, and other safety parameters 
assessed in the paediatric programme.  
However, for hypoglycaemic events, there were higher overall rates for patients in the empagliflozin 
pooled group compared with placebo (23.1 vs 9.4%). There were no relevant differences among 
treatment groups with regard to rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. In addition, there were no severe 
hypoglycaemia events. However, there was an increased risk of hypoglycaemia in patients using insulin 
as a background (14.3 vs. 32.0) as well as in patients without insulin background (6.3 vs. 14.8). A higher 
risk of hypoglycaemia with insulin as comedication is known in adults and mentioned in SmPC. The data 
above demonstrate that empagliflozin in paediatric patients is associated with an increased risk of 
hypoglycaemia, independent of insulin treatment. In the SmPC it has been stated that there were higher 
overall rates of hypoglycaemic events for patients in the empagliflozin pooled group compared with 
placebo (23.1 vs 9.4%). 
Only limited safety data up to 52 weeks is available in the paediatric population. Although no new safety 
concerns emerge from the data presented, the potential need for long-term safety data in this population 
is important. Long term safety data in the paediatric population needs to be followed. The MAH 
committed to following this issue closely in all upcoming PSURs.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall benefit-risk ratio is considered positive.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The Extension of Indication to include treatment of children 10 years and above is approvable. The 
updated product information and RMP are agreed.  
The overall benefit risk balance of Jardiance is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change:

Extension of indication for JARDIANCE to include treatment of children aged 10 years and above with type 
2 diabetes based on results from study DINAMO 1218-0091; this is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-
controlled, parallel group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin and linagliptin over 26 
weeks, with a double-blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks, in children and 
adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in the product information. Version 21.1 of the RMP has 
also been submitted.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0283/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

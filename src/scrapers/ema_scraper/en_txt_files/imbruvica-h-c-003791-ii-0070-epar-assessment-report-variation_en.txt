2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is a variant of CLL 
characterized by the absence of lymphocytosis. Clinically, these two entities are considered and 
managed as the same disease.  
Claimed the therapeutic indication 
“IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab or venetoclax is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL)”. 
Epidemiology 
CLL is the most prevalent adult leukemia in Western countries with an incidence of 4.2/100,000/year 
and a median age of 72 years at diagnosis. 
Biologic features 
CLL/SLL is a neoplastic disorder characterized by the clonal expansion of mature B cells in PB, BM, and 
lymphoid tissues driven primarily by chronic B cell receptor (BCR)–dependent signaling and impaired 
programmed cell death. Tonic BCR signaling in CLL results in the activation of a host of downstream 
effectors that modulate several pathways affecting the survival, proliferation, and migration of CLL 
cells. Among the key kinases that are constitutively activated are BTK and phosphatidyl-inositol 3 
kinase (PI3K), effectors that trigger secondary signaling pathways such as JNK, ERK, mTOR, and NF-
κB. Activation of the later pathway promotes the overexpression of the BCL-2 family of anti-apoptotic 
proteins (eg, BCL-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) allowing CLL cells to survive and escape programmed apoptosis. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The disease is characterized by a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from indolent disease 
requiring no treatment for decades, to markedly aggressive disease that requires urgent intervention. 
Management 
Therapy for patients with previously untreated CLL includes agents with distinct mechanisms of action 
such as BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib), alkylating agents (chlorambucil, bendamustine, 
cyclophosphamide), a nucleoside analogue (fludarabine), anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, 
obinutuzumab), and a BCL-2 inhibitor (venetoclax). Treatment regimens approved for previously 
untreated CLL are administered for a fixed duration (eg, combination regimen fludarabine, 
cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR)or continuously until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity (eg, ibrutinib and acalabrutinib). Ibrutinib is approved in this indication as a single-agent or in 
combination with an anti-CD20 antibody (i.e., rituximab, obinutuzumab).  
Combination chemoimmunotherapy, particularly FCR, has the potential to induce deep responses (40% 
to 45% of patients achieve CR). However, even with FCR treatment, many patients (including those 
who achieve CR) eventually relapse and in patients with high-risk features, such as unmutated IGHV 
and del17p/TP53 mutation, chemoimmunotherapy results in inferior outcomes. In addition, exposure 
to chemoimmunotherapy may be associated with significant toxicities including myelosuppression, 
immune suppression, and treatment-related malignancies such as myelodysplasia, and acute myeloid 
leukemia.  
As continuous therapy in patients with previously untreated CLL, ibrutinib is associated with marked 
improvement in PFS and OS (24-month landmark: 89% and 95%, respectively across a broad 
spectrum of patients including those with high-risk disease. However, single-agent ibrutinib results in a 
limited rate of complete remissions (10% at a median follow-up of 28 months) and is rarely associated 
with undetectable MRD, thus requiring the use of continuous therapy. When used in combination with 
anti-CD20 antibodies, the rate of complete remissions increases (54.5% per investigator for Ibr+R, 
19.5% per IRC for ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab. 
The choice of upfront therapy in treatment-demanding disease is generally guided by patient factors, 
such as age and comorbidities, as well as disease-related factors, notably high-risk features. 
Figure 1 Treatment options - From the ESMO GL on CLL, 2020 
Time-limited therapy with the combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab (Ven+Ob) was recently 
approved in patients with previously untreated CLL based on the results of Study CLL14, which showed 
a significant improvement in PFS versus Clb+Ob (PFS at 24-month landmark: 88% vs 64% with 
Ven+Ob and Clb+Ob, respectively). The combination was associated with a CR rate of 50% and MRD 
negativity rates of 57% and 76% in the BM and PB. However, updated results from the study based on 
longer follow-up (median follow up of 52.4 months) show that PFS in patients with high-risk features 
(eg, positive for del17p or TP53 mutation) are not sustained and MRD negativity in PB rapidly declines. 
More effective targeted regimens that result in deeper responses and longer remissions without the 
need for continuous administration are needed to allow for a clinically meaningful treatment-free 
period for patients with newly diagnosed CLL.  
 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Ibrutinib is a small molecule BTK inhibitor with a molecular weight of 440.50 g/mole (anhydrous 
basis). It is a small molecule drug that inhibits B-cell proliferation and survival by irreversibly 
binding the protein Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Blocking BTK inhibits the B-cell receptor pathway, 
which is often aberrantly active in B cell cancers. The Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number is 
936563-96-1. Ibrutinib has a single chiral center, which is the R enantiomer.   
Currently approved indications: 
IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). 
 
 
 
IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
(see section 5.1). 
IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior 
therapy. 
IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in 
first line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy.  
IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WM. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH was given SA  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/718302/2017 on clinical aspects, such as: the scientific 
rationale supporting the development of the combination of ibrutinib and venetoclax, the proposed 
clinical package; the proposed Phase 3 study design, the proposed choice of the comparator arm, the 
patient population as defined by the eligibility criteria, the choice of independently reviewed PFS as the 
primary endpoint, the choice of secondary endpoints.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
N/A 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
Key efficacy and safety data to support this Type II variation to extend the current authorized 
indication in CLL are derived from the Phase 3 randomized, controlled Study CLL3011 (Ibr+Ven versus 
Clb+Ob) and Phase 2 Study 1142 (Table 1).  
 
Table 1. Description of Studies CLL3011 and 1142 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
 Bioanalytical methods 
Analytical methods for ibrutinib and its metabolite JNJ-54243761 (PCI-45227) were validated and have 
been assessed earlier and deemed acceptable. Ibrutinib and JNJ-54243761 (PCI-45227) samples were 
analysed within 665 days of storage, which is within the 973 days established with an earlier method. 
QCs and calibration standards performed within preset acceptance criteria in both studies GLOW 
(54179060CLL3011) and PCYC-1142-CA, including ISR in the latter. Testing for interference of 
venetoclax with the analysis of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 within 15% of the low QC nominal values, 
showing no interference.  
An LC-MS/MS method for the concentration determination of venetoclax in K2EDTA anticoagulated 
plasma was developed at Abbvie, report A1195425 (ABT199). Samples from studies GLOW and PCYC-
1142-CA were analysed within the established long term stability for venetoclax. No ISR was 
performed for venetoclax. QCs and calibration standards performed within preset acceptance criteria.  
 
 
 
 
Population PK analysis of ibrutinib administered with and without venetoclax 
The pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib were analysed using population pharmacokinetic analysis approach 
(using NONMEM software (Icon)). The first-order condition estimation approximation was used as the 
estimation method. Furthermore, because log-transformed data were used, the INTERACTION option 
was not applied in NONMEM. The NONMEM analysis was performed in a validated environment, based 
on Good Automated Manufacturing Practice and in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 11 and Good Clinical Practice regulations. Small modifications to the analysis dataset, 
exploratory analysis, diagnostic graphics, post-processing of NONMEM analysis results, and the 
statistical analysis were carried out using R Project for Statistical Computing, Version 3.4.1 or higher 
(Comprehensive R Network, http://cran.r-project.org [R Development Core Team 2012]).  
Studies and data that were used to develop the population pharmacokinetic model are summarized in 
Table 1 and described briefly in Table 2. The subjects’ ages at baseline ranged from 28 to 93 years of 
age, with a median of 64 years, and their body weights at baseline ranged from 47 to 140 kg, with a 
median of 78 kg. The majority of subjects were White (approximately 87%) and male (approximately 
59%). 
Table 2. Overview of Studies Included in the Population Pharmacokinetics analysis  
The potential differences between Study 1142 and Study CLL3011 were explored graphically by 
overlaying concentration data from the 2 studies. The observed plasma concentration is presented in 
Figure 2.  
 
 
Figure 2. Log-linear Plot of Ibrutinib Concentrations vs Time Since Latest Dose by Study 
Ibrutinib disposition was described by an previously developed (Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of 
Ibrutinib 2015) open, 2-compartment disposition model with linear elimination. The absorption of 
ibrutinib was best described by a sequential zero-first order process, characterized by lag time, D1, 
and ka. The previously developed population PK model was first used, without re-estimation 
(maximum a posteriori approach), to describe the attained plasma concentrations from studies 1142 
and 3011. The VPCs indicated that, while the model described Ctrough data well, the ibrutinib peak 
was under-predicted for Study 1142 (Figure 4). Also, for Study 1142 the ETAs were not centered on 
zero, with highly significant deviations (p<0.0001) for V2, Q, V3, and lag time; the largest deviation 
was a median ETA of 0.3 for V2, corresponding to a 35% higher V2.  
Several sets of re-estimations of model parameters were attempted, resulting in a final model (run 
310) where all structural parameters (CL, V2, Q, V3, ka, D1 for subjects on fasting and modified 
fasting regimen, lag time, and the residual unexplained variability) were re-estimated, but the 
covariate effects (CYP3A inhibitors and age on F1) and random effects were fixed to previous 
estimates. The fit of this model was significantly improved, as indicated by a fall in objective function 
of 111.6 points.  
The comparison between the re-estimated and the original parameters indicates a longer lag time (by 
58%) and duration of the zero-order absorption process (by 28%). The apparent volume of distribution 
at steady-state (estimated as the sum of V2/F and V3/F; 6,904 L) was 24% smaller than the previous 
estimate, and apparent intercompartmental clearance was reduced by approximately 45% compared 
with the original. However, no large difference was observed between the original and re-estimated 
values for CL/F (−8%). Visual predictive check with updated model is shown in Figure 2, and model 
parameters for the final model are shown in Table 3. After re-estimation of parameters, tests for 
differences in CL and F1 of ibrutinib when administered alone or with venetoclax were not significant, 
suggesting no meaningful interaction of venetoclax on the pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib.

Noncompartmental analysis of the effect of Venetoclax on the Pharmacokinetics of Ibrutinib  
Mean steady-state ibrutinib exposure, as based on the AUC0-24, was similar when administered as a 
single agent at 420 mg once daily to MRD cohort subjects with CLL/SLL during the lead-in period of 
 
 
 
 
Study 1142 (641 ng.h/mL) or in combination with 400 mg venetoclax (637 ng.h/mL). Mean steady-
state ibrutinib exposures for subjects receiving 420 mg/day i n combination with venetoclax in Study 
1142 were also similar to those observed previously in CLL/SLL subjects at a 420 mg daily dose. The 
reported AUC0-24 at steady-state in Study 1142 was 641 ng.h/mL (as single agent) versus 708 
ng.h/mL in Study PCYC-1102-CA. For Study CLL3011, based on the modeling results, no effect of 
venetoclax on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics was observed.  
Noncompartmental analysis of the effect of Ibrutinib on the Pharmacokinetics of Venetoclax 
The effect of ibrutinib on the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax was investigated by comparing steady-
state pharmacokinetic data from Study 1142, in which venetoclax was administered in combination 
with ibrutinib, with historical monotherapy data for venetoclax from Study M12-175 (Table 4). Study 
M12-175 evaluated the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax at a once-daily dose of 20 to 1,200 mg in 
subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Pharmacokinetic data for 
this study are provided for subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL who received venetoclax alone 
without concomitant use of moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors under low-fat conditions.  
An increase of approximately 1.8-fold (based on AUC0-24) in venetoclax exposure was observed in 
subjects receiving venetoclax in combination with ibrutinib in Study 1142 compared with subjects 
receiving venetoclax alone in Study M12-175. The venetoclax observed mean Ctrough in study 3011 
was higher in Cycle 6 Day 1 (1,765 ng/mL), reflecting the mean steady-state Ctrough at 400 mg, 
compared with Cycle 5 Day 1 (1,139 ng/mL), reflecting the mean steady-state Ctrough at 200 mg, due 
to the venetoclax ramp-up period. Venetoclax trough concentrations at steady-state were higher in this 
study in combination with ibrutinib compared with monotherapy based on historical data (mean range 
of 630 to 810 ng/mL).  
The biological reason for this increase in systemic exposure is unclear. In vitro studies suggest that 
ibrutinib may inhibit BCRP and P-gp transport at clinical doses. Venetoclax is a P-gp and BCRP 
substrate, as well as a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor and weak OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro. Therefore, the 
observed increase in venetoclax exposure, when administered with ibrutinib, may be due to a 
transporter-mediated interaction, which may increase the bioavailability and/or reduce the clearance of 
the compound.

Venetoclax Alone or 400 mg Venetoclax in Combination With 420 mg Ibrutinib in Subjects With

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ibrutinib and venetoclax have complementary mechanisms of action targeting distinct B-cell pathways 
involved in the propagation of CLL cells. Ibrutinib arrests CLL cell proliferation. Venetoclax is pro-
apoptotic and induces early cell death. Ibrutinib also affects the adhesion and migration of CLL cells, 
resulting in rapid efflux of CLL cells from tissue compartments, especially lymph nodes and spleen, into 
the peripheral blood. Venetoclax treatment results in effective clearance of the blood and bone 
marrow, but residual disease can be observed in lymph nodes. Together the 2 drugs are expected to 
provide complementary and effective clearance of disease. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
 The clinical study design was not optimal for PK/PD modelling (a single-dose level, dose adjustments, 
relatively high correlation between metrics, no information on monotherapy treatment). In addition, 
the current assessment evaluated numerous endpoints without any correction for multiplicity. 
Therefore, the analysis should be considered purely exploratory and only general information on the 
PKPD modelling is presented as interpretation of these findings should be done cautiously.  
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
PFS was explored by Kaplan-Meier plots. Splitting PFS by study, survival curves appeared different, 
therefore, the graphical exploration of PFS was performed for each study separately. No relationship 
between PFS with exposure could be observed in any of the plots. 
The rates of response for CRR, ORR, and MRD negativity by flow cytometry and NGS were plotted by 
quartiles of the summary exposure measures. CRR and ORR appear to be essentially independent of 
ibrutinib or venetoclax concentrations. However, for MRD negativity by flow cytometry and MRD 
negativity by NGS, there is a trend towards an increase with increasing systemic exposure for both 
ibrutinib and venetoclax, further assessed using regression analysis. 
All ibrutinib and venetoclax systemic exposure summaries had significant effects on MRD negativity by 
flow cytometry and MRD negativity by NGS (the latter available only for Study CLL3011), with ibrutinib 
Ctrough providing the most significant effect for both MRD negativity by flow cytometry (p=0.00144) 
and MRD negativity by NGS (p=0.00126). The relationships between venetoclax observed Ctrough and 
MRD negativity by flow cytometry and MRD negativity by NGS were also significant (p=0.00561 and 
p=0.00603, respectively). When including the most significant ibrutinib descriptor of systemic 
exposure (Ctrough) together with the venetoclax effect (Ctrough_obs_venetoclax) in the model, and 
their interaction, both were highly significant (p<0.01) for MRD negativity by flow cytometry and NGS, 
but with a significant negative interaction. Covariates were added in a stepwise fashion to the MRD 
negativity by flow cytometry model, in which Ctrough and venetoclax observed Ctrough are the 
independent variables, resulted in a significant effect of the IGHV prognostic factor. The probability of 
MRD negativity by flow cytometry is lower in subjects with mutated IGHV than in subjects with 
unmutated IGHV. There was no significant interaction between IGHV status and the ibrutinib or 
venetoclax effects. 
Exposure-safety analysis 
 
The incidence of the different types of TEAEs was plotted by quartiles of the summary exposure 
measures. On visual inspection, liver function abnormalities, all Grade ≥3 TEAEs, all serious TEAEs, 
and all TEAEs leading to ibrutinib and venetoclax dose reduction, dose interruption, or drug 
discontinuation appear to increase with increasing exposure for both ibrutinib and venetoclax. In 
addition, any events of hemorrhage, diarrhea, and infection appear to increase with increasing 
ibrutinib exposure, and neutropenia appears to increase with increasing venetoclax exposure. These 
TEAEs were therefore explored further using regression analysis. 
There were significant associations of both ibrutinib and venetoclax exposure on the incidence of Grade 
≥3 TEAEs, with the most significant effect being venetoclax observed Ctrough. Upon fitting effects of 
ibrutinib observed Ctrough and venetoclax observed Ctrough simultaneously, and also the interaction 
of these parameters, only the venetoclax association remains significant. Ibrutinib exposure was 
significantly associated with the incidence of TEAEs leading to ibrutinib dose reduction, dose 
interruption, or drug discontinuation. Age was a significant covariate for association with TEAEs leading 
to ibrutinib dose reduction, dose interruption, or drug discontinuation, with the risk increasing with 
age. Sex was a significant covariate for association with TEAEs leading to venetoclax dose reduction, 
dose interruption, or drug discontinuation, with the risk found to be higher in females. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analytical methods for ibrutinib and its metabolite JNJ-54243761 (PCI-45227) were validated and have 
been assessed earlier and deemed acceptable. An LC-MS/MS method for the concentration 
determination of venetoclax in K2EDTA anticoagulated plasma was developed. The bioanalysis is 
deemed acceptable. 
The exposures of ibrutinib and venetoclax were assessed using non-compartmental analysis. No 
dedicated DDI studies are included in the current submission. The potential for a DDI between ibrutinib 
and venetoclax was evaluated via comparison of the ibrutinib and venetoclax pharmacokinetics from 
combination treatment and monotherapy (historical data). Additionally, the ibrutinib plasma 
concentrations were analysed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling. 
The pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and venetoclax were assessed using non-compartmental analysis. 
The potential for a DDI between ibrutinib and venetoclax was evaluated via comparison of historical 
data. Additionally, the ibrutinib plasma concentrations were analysed using nonlinear mixed effects 
modelling. Venetoclax observed plasma concentration at steady-state exposure (approximately 1.8-
fold higher AUC, 1.7-fold higher Cmax and 2.8-fold higher Ctrough). In vitro studies suggest that 
ibrutinib may inhibit BCRP and P-gp transport at clinical doses. Venetoclax is a P-gp and BCRP 
substrate, as well as a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor and weak OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro. Therefore, the 
observed increase in venetoclax exposure, when administered with ibrutinib, may be due to a 
transporter-mediated interaction, which may increase the bioavailability and/or reduce the clearance of 
the compound. 
Non-compartmental analysis indicated that Ibrutinib pharmacokinetics were generally consistent with 
previously reported (historical) assessments and no effect of venetoclax on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics 
was observed. The population pharmacokinetic analysis of ibrutinib using a previously developed model 
indicated that, while the model described Ctrough data well, the ibrutinib peak was under-predicted. 
Several sets of re-estimations of model parameters were attempted, resulting in a final model where 
all structural parameters were re-estimated, but the covariate effects and random effects were fixed to 
previous estimates. After re-estimation of parameters, tests for differences in CL and F1 of ibrutinib 
when administered alone or with venetoclax were not significant. The model could describe the 
ibrutinib plasma concentration acceptably.  
ER analysis was also conducted, where clinical efficacy and safety endpoint data were considered from 
253 subjects in both Studies 1142 and CLL3011. For the ER analysis of binary endpoints, a graphical 
exploration (incidence of endpoint by quartile of exposure) was performed and, if significant trends 
were observed, logistic regression (mono- [for individual compounds] and bi-variate [for both ibrutinib 
and venetoclax]) was performed. Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by quartiles of exposure summaries 
were used to explore the ER relationship for PFS. 
The present clinical studies, performed at a single-dose level with along with dose adjustments based 
on safety, are not optimally suited for highlighting ER relationships. There is also a relatively high 
correlation between metrics of systemic exposure for ibrutinib and observed Ctrough of venetoclax 
(were still explored as the coefficient of determination is below 0.8, however, only cautious conclusion 
can be made). There was no monotherapy treatment arm with ibrutinib and venetoclax. The ER 
assessment evaluated numerous endpoints without any correction for multiplicity, so it is also possible 
that some of the significant ER relationships were highlighted by chance alone. The results should be 
interpreted with caution.  
In general, increasing systemic exposures were associated with increased incidence of all Grade ≥3 
TEAEs and TEAEs leading to ibrutinib or venetoclax dose reduction, dose interruption, or drug 
discontinuation. The observed association between systemic exposure and all Grade ≥3 TEAEs was 
driven primarily by the increased incidence of neutropenia and diarrhea. In interpretation of these 
findings, the study design and potential confounding effects of the two components of the combination, 
should be considered. 
As the exposure of venetoclax is higher when given in combination with ibrutinib, adherence to the 
ibrutinib and venetoclax dose-modification guidelines is important in ensuring the safety of the 
combination. The dose-modification guidelines will ensure an optimal efficacious dose for most of the 
patients whilst providing the option for a more tolerable reduced dose for the patients who are more 
vulnerable for specific TEAEs. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib in combination with venetoclax have been adequately characterized 
and found to be consistent with previously reported (historical) assessments. Combination of ibrutinib 
and venetoclax results in an increased exposure of venetoclax (1.8-fold and 2.5-fold higher AUC24 and 
Cmin respectively), which has been described in the SmPC section 4.5. The clinical perspective on 
safety with the proposed posology is discussed in the clinical safety section.

Treatments 
Subjects assigned to Treatment Arm A (Ibr+Ven) received ibrutinib (420 mg/day orally) given as 
lead-in treatment for 3 cycles. Starting at Cycle 4 and contingent on completion of TLS risk 
assessment, venetoclax dose ramp-up (from 20 to 400 mg over 5 weeks) was initiated. Combined 
treatment with ibrutinib and venetoclax was administered for 12 cycles, through Cycle 15, in the 
absence of PD or treatment-limiting toxicity. One cycle corresponds to 28 days. 
Subjects assigned to Treatment Arm B were to receive 6 cycles (28 days/cycle) of Clb+Ob treatment 
in the absence of PD or treatment-limiting toxicity. Chlorambucil was to be administered orally at a 
dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight on Days 1-and 15 of Cycles 1 to 6. Obinutuzumab was to be 
administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2-to 6. Each dose of 
obinutuzumab given IV was equivalent to 1000 mg except for the initial-infusion in Cycle 1 where the 
same total dose was to be administered over Day 1 (100 mg) and-Day 2 (900 mg). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: PFS by IRC based on the iwCLL 2008 GL. 
Secondary endpoints tested hierarchically in the following order: MRD negativity rate in bone 
marrow; CR; ORR; OS; Rate of sustained platelet improvement; Rate of sustained hemoglobin 
improvement; Time to improvement in FACIT fatigue score. 
MRD negativity rate 
MRD negativity rate was defined as the proportion of subjects who reached MRD negative disease 
status (<1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes) on or prior to initiation of subsequent anti-leukemic therapy 
(including subsequent single-agent ibrutinib). All randomized subjects are included in this analysis, 
subjects with missing MRD data are considered MRD positive. The overall MRD negativity rate in the 
bone marrow as assessed by NGS was the primary MRD analysis used for hierarchical testing. The 
MRD negativity rate by NGS in the peripheral blood was considered as the supportive analysis for this 
endpoint. MRD negativity rate among subjects who achieved a best overall response of CR/CRi per IRC 
assessment was conducted as supplementary analysis. 
The MRD negativity rates in bone marrow at 3 months post-treatment (ie, end-of-treatment for each 
treatment arm) and in peripheral blood at 3 months and 12 months post-treatment were evaluated as 
supplementary analysis. The 3- and 12-month post-treatment timepoints for-Ibr+Ven correspond to 
DE6 and DE8; for Clb+Ob these timepoints correspond to DE3 and DE6. 
 
 
 
 
 
Sustained hematologic improvement 
Defined as hematological improvement that was sustained continuously for ≥56 days without blood 
transfusion or growth factors on or prior to initiation of subsequent anti-leukemic therapy (including 
subsequent single-agent ibrutinib):  
Hemoglobin levels increased ≥2 g/dL from baseline and lasted for at least 56 days 
• 
without blood transfusion or growth factors  
Platelet counts increased ≥50% over baseline and lasted for at least 56 days without 
• 
blood transfusion or growth factors 
Sample size 
A median PFS of 27 months is reported for the Clb+Ob when it is used to treat patients with treatment 
naïve CLL. It is assumed that the PFS follows an exponential distribution with a constant hazard rate. 
Utilizing a 1:1 randomization, this study will enroll approximately 200 subjects (100 subjects into 
Ibr+Ven and 100 subjects into the Clb+Ob treatment groups) to observe 71 PFS events. The study is 
designed to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.5 for the Ibr+Ven-treatment group relative to the Clb+Ob 
group (corresponding to an improvement of 100% in-median PFS, e.g. from 27 months to 54 months) 
with 80% power at a 2-sided significance level of-0.05. 
A uniform accrual rate of 20 subjects per month will result in a study duration of approximately 32 
months after the first subject is randomized, with 10 months of enrollment and 22 months of-follow-up 
to observe 71 PFS events. 
Randomisation 
Central randomization was implemented; Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups 
based on a computer-generated randomization schedule, the randomization was balanced by using 
permuted blocks and stratified by IGHV mutational status (mutated vs. unmutated vs. not-available) 
and presence of del11q (yes vs. no).  
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, In this open-label study, neither the subjects nor the investigators are blinded to 
treatment group-assignment. However, access to efficacy data is controlled so that the Sponsor’s staff 
overseeing conduct of the study or analyzing/summarizing data do not have an aggregated 
efficacy-summary by treatment until the database is locked for primary analysis. The IRC who 
performs tumor assessment are required to be blinded to study treatment group assignment. 
Statistical methods 
No formal interim analysis for efficacy was planned, due to the small sample size and short 
accrual-period of the study. 
All statistical tests will be performed at a 2-sided significance level of 5%, unless otherwise-specified. 
All interval estimation will be reported using 2-sided 95% CIs. Multiplicity incurred from testing 
primary and secondary endpoints will be controlled using the serial gatekeeping procedure. The 
 
 
 
hypothesis for a secondary endpoint will be tested if and only if the null hypotheses for the primary 
endpoint and for the preceding secondary endpoints are rejected. 
Primary analysis 
No formal interim analysis for efficacy was planned, due to the small sample size and short 
accrual-period of the study. 
All statistical tests were to be performed at a 2-sided significance level of 5%, unless 
otherwise-specified. All interval estimation was to be reported using 2-sided 95% CIs. Decision making 
will be based on the stratified log-rank test for statistical significance. Kaplan-Meier method will be 
used to estimate the distribution of PFS for each treatment group. The non-stratified Cox regression 
model may be used to analyze treatment effect on PFS after adjusting for covariates (selected 
demographics and baseline characteristics) as appropriate. 
Primary analysis 
Estimand Scientific Question of Interest:  
What is the effect on PFS of assigning subjects to Ibr+Ven vs. Clb+Ob? This primary estimand is the 
main clinical quantity of interest to be estimated in this study, which is defined by the following 
attributes: 
• Population: subjects with CLL/SLL who are treatment naïve 
• Treatment: fixed duration Ibr+Ven vs. Clb+Ob 
• Variable: PFS (PD is based on IRC assessment) 
Population-level summary: Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS, hazard ratio of Ibr+Ven vs. Clb+Ob

o  High: any lymph node ≥ 10cm OR ALC ≥ 25x109/L AND any lymph node ≥ 5cm 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protocol deviations 
Four (1.9%) subjects (1 [0.9%] subject in the Ibr+Ven arm and 3 [2.9%] subjects in the Clb+Ob arm) 
missed a DE visit due to the COVID-19 pandemic that were considered as major protocol deviations for 
potentially delaying the detection of PD. 
Baseline data 
 
 
 
 
 
Although subjects with del17p or known TP53 mutation at baseline were excluded from the study, 
subjects with unknown TP53 mutation status were allowed to participate. After randomization, central 
laboratory testing identified 9 (4.3%) subjects with a TP53 mutation, 7 (6.6%) in the Ibr+Ven arm and 
2 (1.9%) in the Clb+Ob arm.  
Numbers analysed 
The primary analysis included 211 subjects who were randomized and treated (106 subjects in the 
Ibr+Ven arm and 105 subjects in the Clb+Ob arm). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy analysis: PFS by IRC 
Performed 26 February 2021 with a median time on study for all subjects of 27.7 (95% CI: 27.60 to 
27.89) months. 
 
 
 
 
 
Alternative (sensitivity) analyses of PFS 
PFS by investigator: HR 0.207 (95% CI: 0.120, 0.357; nominal p<0.0001), based on event rates of 
58% and 16% in the control and experimental arm, respectively. The overall concordance between IRC 
and investigator assessments of PD and non-PD events was 93.4% for the experimental arm and 
81.0% for the control arm. 
PFS analysis censoring subjects who started a subsequent anticancer therapy prior to PD: HR=0.216 
(95% CI: 0.131, 0.356); p<0.0001. 
A post-hoc restricted mean survival time analysis was also performed: Subjects in the experimental 
arm, on average, were progression-free for 3 (95% CI: 1.4 to 4.6) and 5.7 (95% CI: 3.5 to 7.9) 
months more than subjects in the control arm at 24 and 30 months after randomization, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup analyses 
 
 
 
A multivariate analysis was conducted for PFS to evaluate the treatment effect when controlling for 
potential prognostic factors. After adjustment for selected prespecified baseline factors, the treatment 
effect was consistent with the primary analysis, HR=0.177 (95% CI: 0.100, 0.313); nominal 
p<0.0001. 
Extended follow-up for PFS by IRC (data cut-off 19 August 2021) 
With a median time on study for all subjects of 34.1 months the HR was 0.212 (95% CI: 0.129, 
0.349); nominal p<0.0001.  
A total of 3 additional IRC-assessed PD events occurred after primary analysis (2 in the 
experimental arm and 1 in the control arm). However, for 3 subjects in the experimental arm the 
assessment of PD at primary analysis was converted to maintained response by the IRC after 
consideration of data from additional timepoints with extended follow-up. Thus, compared with the 
 
primary analysis, 1 less subject in the experimental arm and 1 additional subject in the control arm 
had IRC-assessed PD. 
 
 
 
 
Secondary efficacy analyses 
MRD negativity rate 
MRD negativity rates were assessed by NGS and flow cytometry (not further discussed in this AR). The 
overall MRD negativity rate (best MRD response) in BM assessed by NGS was the primary analysis 
used in the hierarchical testing. The threshold for defining undetectable MRD (MRD negativity) in the 
blood and bone marrow was set at <1 CLL cell per 10,000 (10-4) leukocytes for both assays. 
•  Primary analysis: MRD negativity rates assessed by NGS (best MRD response) 
 
 
•  MRD negativity rates assessed by NGS at 3 and 12 months post-treatment 
At 3 months post-treatment of the 56 subjects in the experimental arm who were MRD-negative in 
peripheral blood and who had a matched bone marrow specimen collected, 52 (92.9%) were MRD-
negative in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. At the same timepoint, of the 39 subjects from 
the control arm who were MRD-negative in peripheral blood and who had a matched bone marrow 
specimen collected, 17 (43.6%) were MRD-negative in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. 
•  MRD negativity rates by NGS at Equivalent Timepoints  
−  At DE3 (9 months after randomization): MRD negativity rates for subjects in the experimental 
arm and the control arm were 39.6% and 17.1% in the bone marrow, respectively; 46.2% and 
39.0% in the peripheral blood.  
−  At DE6 (18 months after randomization): MRD negativity rates for subjects in the experimental 
arm and the control arm were 51.9% and 9.5% in the bone marrow, respectively; 54.7% and 
12.4% in the peripheral blood.  
−  At DE8 (26 months after randomization): MRD negativity rates for subjects in the experimental 
arm and the control arm were 49.1% and 3.8% in the peripheral blood, respectively.  
The rate ratios of MRD negativity rates comparing experimental arm versus control arm in 
the peripheral blood increased over time (DE3: 1.18; DE6: 4.41; DE8: 12.84). 
 
•  MRD negativity rates by NGS by best overall response of CR/CRi per IRC 
By use of a stratified CMH chi-square test, no statistical nominal differences were noted between study 
arms.

Primary analysis, per IRC 
 
 
 
 
At the cut-off, only 3/41 subjects in the experimental arm and 1/12 subjects in the control arm had 
lost response (including death). The 12-month landmark estimate for duration of IRC-assessed CR 
(CR/CRi) was 100% in the experimental arm and 91.7% in the control arm. 
•

Experimental arm: 45.3% 
Control arm: 13.3% 
The 12-month landmark estimate for duration of investigator-assessed CR (CR/CRi) was 93.9% in the 
experimental arm and 87.5% in the control arm. 
• 
CR rate per IRC: Extended follow-up 
With extended follow-up, an overall response of CR/CRi was reported for 3 additional subjects (2 
subjects in the experimental arm and 1 subject in the control arm) compared with the 
primary analysis; CR/CRi rate 40.6% vs 12.4%. 
The 18-month landmark estimate for duration of IRC-assessed CR (CR/CRi) was 97.5% in the 
experimental arm and 84.6% in the control arm.

arm and the control arm, respectively. 
 
 
 
Sustained hematologic improvement 
At the primary analysis, the proportion of subjects with sustained improvement in hemoglobin was 
similar for the experimental arm compared with the control arm (44.3% vs. 50.5%). Also the 
proportion of subjects with sustained improvement in platelets was similar for experimental arm 
compared with the control arm (24.5% vs. 29.5%). These outcomes remained essentially similar at 
the extended follow-up analysis. 
Time to improvement in FACIT-Fatigue score 
As of the data cut-off for the primary analysis, the median time to clinically meaningful (≥3 points 
increase on 52-point scale) improvement in FACIT-Fatigue score was 5.59 months for subjects in the 
experimental arm versus 3.75 months for subjects in the control arm (HR=1.369; 95% CI: 0.959, 
1.954). 
 
 
Ancillary analyses 
Duration of response (DOR) 
As of the data cut-off for the primary analysis, with an overall median follow-up of 27.7 months, the 
median DOR for subjects who achieved an IRC-assessed PR or better was 28.9 months (95% CI: 
28.68, NE) in the experimental arm and 21.1 months (95% CI: 15.93, 25.10) in the control arm.  
The 24-month landmark estimate for IRC-assessed DOR was 89.9% in the experimental arm and 
41.2% in the control arm.  
• 
Extended follow-up 
 
 
 
With an overall median follow-up of 34.1 months, the median DOR for subjects who achieved an IRC-
assessed PR or better was not reached in the experimental arm and was 21.4 months (95% CI: 18.83, 
28.58) in the control arm.  
The 30-month landmark estimate for IRC-assessed DOR was 86.7% in the experimental arm and 
35.5% in the control arm. A graphical illustration is shown below. 
Time to next treatment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of 4 subjects from the experimental arm and 27 subjects from the control arm who had initiated 
subsequent anticancer therapy, 1 and 22 subjects received subsequent anticancer therapy with a BTK 
inhibitor. One subject from the control arm received subsequent anticancer therapy with venetoclax. 
 
 
• 
Extended follow-up 
The median time to subsequent anticancer therapy was still not reached in either treatment arm with a 
HR of 0.147 (95% CI: 0.062, 0.350). 
Of 6 and 35 subjects in the experimental and control arm, respectively, who had initiated subsequent 
anticancer therapy, 2 and 28 subjects received subsequent anticancer therapy with a BTK inhibitor. 
Four subjects from the control arm received subsequent anticancer therapy with venetoclax. 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome Risk Reduction Based on Tumour Burden 
At baseline, 69 subjects in the experimental arm had an indication for hospitalization (26 due to 
TLS risk from high tumor burden and 43 due to TLS risk from medium tumor burden with CrCl <80 
mL/min). After 3 cycles of ibrutinib lead-in, hospitalization was no longer indicated for 24 (34.8%) of 
these subjects.  
 
 
Of 49 subjects for whom hospitalization was indicated after 3 cycles of ibrutinib, 2 subjects had TLS 
risk based on high tumor burden and 47 had TLS risk based on medium tumor burden but with a CrCl 
<80 mL/min. 
Updated OS Analysis for Study CLL3011 
Based on a data cut-off of 17 January 2022 (median time on study: 38.9 months [Attachment 
TSIDS04]), the hazard ratio (HR) for OS was estimated at 0.582 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.286, 
1.187) (Table 9). The median OS was not reached in either treatment arm. The Kaplan-Meier OS 
estimates at 36 months were 89.5% and 84.3% in the Ibr+Ven and Clb+Ob arms, respectively. Thus, 
the positive trend observed with the August 2021 data cut favoring the experimental treatment is 
maintained in this updated analysis. 
 
 
Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Efficacy Results 
“As of the data cut-off for the primary analysis, there was limited impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
integrity of the study and the primary efficacy endpoint (PFS):  
Six (2.8%) subjects were pending completion of the fixed duration treatment phase when the COVID-
19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. 
Twenty-one (19.8%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 13 (12.4%) subjects in the Clb+Ob arm had at 
least 1 DE visit missed due to COVID-19. No subjects were lost to follow-up and no subject missed 2 
or more consecutive DE visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Four subjects had missed DE visits that 
were considered as major protocol deviations for potentially delaying the detection of PD due to 
COVID-19. Sixteen (15.1%) and 23 (21.9%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven and Clb+Ob arms, respectively, 
had at least 1 DE visit delayed due to COVID-19. 
Five deaths were reported as COVID-19 related during the study (1 in the Ibr+Ven arm and 4 in the 
Clb+Ob arm). All 5 deaths reported as COVID-19 related occurred post-fixed duration treatment; only 
1 of these deaths occurred prior to PD. The impact of this death on the primary endpoint analysis 
was considered negligible.  
A pre-planned supplementary PFS analysis censoring subjects who died pre-PD related to COVID-19 
was not conducted because the threshold specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan was not met. A 
supplementary OS analysis censoring subjects who died due to COVID-19 was conducted and showed 
results consistent with the primary OS analysis.  
A supplementary OS analysis censoring deaths related to COVID-19 at extended follow-up is inserted 
below by the assessor. Without such censoring, the HR was 0.760 (95% CI: 0.352, 1.642) at the cut-
off for extended follow-up. 
 
 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the integrity of the study and the primary efficacy endpoint 
(PFS) remained limited with extended follow-up. One additional subject from the Clb+Ob arm had at 
least 1 DE visit missed due to COVID-19. Four additional subjects from the Ibr+Ven arm had at least 1 
DE visit delayed due to COVID-19. No new COVID-19 infection related deaths were reported”. 
Title of Study  
PHASE 2 STUDY OF THE COMBINATION OF IBRUTINIB PLUS VENETOCLAX IN SUBJECTS 
WITH TREATMENT-NAIVE CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA / SMALL LYMPHOCYTIC 
LYMPHOMA; PCYC-1142-CA 
Methods 
Study 1142 was developed to evaluate if discontinuing ibrutinib in the setting of a confirmed 
MRD-negative response with the combination of ibrutinib + venetoclax, allows for a treatment holiday. 
Encouraging early response data from investigator-initiated trials in subjects with relapsed/refractory 
and previously untreated CLL informed the addition of a FD cohort in which subjects received a fixed 
duration of Ibr+Ven. Only the FD cohort is part of this application. 
 
 
 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria 
−  Diagnosis of CLL/SLL that meets IWCLL diagnostic criteria (Hallek 2008). 
−  Active disease meeting at least 1 of the IWCLL criteria (Hallek 2008) for requiring treatment. 
−  Measurable nodal disease by computed tomography (CT). 
−  Men and women ≥18 and ≤70 years of age. 
−  ECOG performance status of 0-2. 
Key exclusion criteria 
−  Any prior therapy used for treatment of CLL or SLL. 
−  Known or suspected history of Richter’s transformation. 
Treatments 
The Ibr+Ven treatment schedule for the Study 1142 FD cohort was identical to that used in Study 
CLL3011: ibrutinib (420 mg/day orally) given as lead-in treatment for 3 cycles. Starting at Cycle 4 and 
contingent on completion of TLS risk assessment, venetoclax dose ramp-up (from 20 to 400 mg over 5 
weeks) was initiated. Combined treatment with ibrutinib and venetoclax was administered for 12 
cycles, through Cycle 15, in the absence of PD or treatment-limiting toxicity. One cycle corresponds to 
28 days. 
If PD per iwCLL criteria was confirmed after completion of the FD regimen, single-agent ibrutinib could 
be reintroduced and given continuously until PD or unacceptable toxicity. In addition, for subjects with 
 
PD following durable efficacy after Ibr+Ven treatment (defined as time to progression after completion 
of fixed duration regimen of > 2 years), Ibr+Ven could be reintroduced and administered for the same 
15-cycle FD period as given initially. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: Complete response (CR/CRi) per investigator assessment 
 
 
 
Sample size 
In the FD cohort, assuming the complete response rate for Ibr + Ven is 50%, 125 subjects without del 
17p will provide 83% power to ensure the rate is > 37% at 1-side alpha 0.025. A CR rate of 50% 
would represent meaningful improvement compared to the CR rate seen with the fixed duration 
combination of bendamustine + rituximab (31%), and would be an improvement over the CR rate seen 
with the standard of care fixed duration regimen fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (40%) 
which were obtained in the CLL10 study, which included only patients without del 17p. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
 
 
 
Statistical methods 
This is a 2-cohort Phase 2 study assessing both MRD-guided discontinuation and fixed duration (FD) 
therapy with the combination of Ibr + Ven in subjects with treatment-naïve CLL or SLL. The MRD 
cohort is not part of this application. 
FD cohort  
The FD cohort was added in Protocol Amendment 1 after the completion of MRD cohort enrolment.  
The primary hypothesis is that the CR rate is > 37% after 12-cycle Ibr + Ven treatment. The 
hypothesis was to be tested at 1-sided α level of 0.025 using asymptotic test for the 
binomial proportion. Since the assumption for sample size and power of this cohort is based on the 
historical data of subjects without del 17p, the formal hypothesis testing was to be performed on the 
non-del 17p population. The Non-del 17p population includes enrolled subjects who received at least 1 
dose of study drug, and who are without del 17p abnormality according to non-missing baseline FISH 
results. All analyses for the FD cohort will be repeated on the All treated population as supportive 
analyses. 
The primary analysis was to be based on investigator assessment and performed after the last enrolled 
FD subject has the opportunity to be followed for at least 30 cycles (15 cycles of treatment + 15 cycles 
of posttreatment follow-up). In addition to investigator assessment, an IRC blinded to the study 
treatment was to evaluate the responses for both cohorts independently. 
Hypothesis testing was to be performed independently for the two cohorts (without multiplicity 
adjustment) for the primary endpoint only. Other endpoints were to be summarized descriptively 
with 95% CI whenever applicable. 
Subgroup analyses were to be performed for Age, gender, race, ECOG score, Rai stage, bulky disease, 
Del 17p, Del 17p or TP53 mutated, FISH, IGHV per central lab, creatinine clearance and NCI ODWG 
Liver function classification. 
No interim analysis was planned or performed. 
 
Results 
Participant flow 
At the time of the primary analysis the median time on study was 27.9 months (range: 0.8 to 33.2 
months). 
The median time on study with extended follow-up was 38.7 months (range: 0.8 to 41.4 months). 
Reintroduction/other subsequent anti-neoplastic therapies 
At the primary analysis, 4 subjects (2.5%) had reintroduced ibrutinib post-PD; 5 subjects had received 
other therapy (mainly systemic therapy). 
With extended follow-up, an additional 5 subjects had reintroduced ibrutinib post-PD relative to the 
primary analysis; 6 subjects had received other therapy (mainly systemic therapy). 
Recruitment 
Study Period: 28 September 2016 (date of first subject consented) to 15 December 2020 (date 
of database lock – primary analysis); date for database lock for extended follow-up analysis was 4 
October 2021. 
This study was conducted at 39 centers in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, and Italy. 
 
 
 
 
Conduct of the study 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) 
Site-level IPDs: for one site, CT scans were not performed at Cycle 7 for 4 subjects.  
At the subject level, IPDs related to unmet eligibility criteria, efficacy, and safety were reported:  
• Two subjects had IPDs related to not meeting all eligibility criteria, 1 subject was enrolled despite the 
need to be treated with 20 mg prednisone during the screening period to control autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia, while 1 subject did not have an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 
coagulation test performed at screening.  
• One subject had an IPD impacting efficacy. 1 subject refused to have CT scans performed at multiple 
timepoints.  
 
 
 
 
• One subject had an IPD related to safety. On 3 separate occasions, 1 subject experienced Grade 3-4 
neutropenia related to venetoclax treatment, and venetoclax was not dose-reduced or withheld per 
protocol requirements. No IPDs were reported for the FD cohort with extended follow-up. 
Study conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic (selected by the assessor) 
The visit impact of logistical restrictions included subjects of the FD and MRD cohorts with virtual 
visits/phone calls (37.7% and 49.4%, respectively), missed visits (14.5% and 0.6%, respectively), and 
in-person, partial assessments (10.7% and 9.8%, respectively. Similar findings were observed after 
extended follow-up (virtual visits/phone calls: 41.5% and 51.2%, respectively; missed visits: 
15.1% and 0.6%, respectively; partial assessments done in person: 10.7% and 11.6%, respectively.  
With regard to post-treatment follow-up by investigator, most subjects in the FD cohort (> 98%) had 
their required assessments for overall response, radiology, hematology, and physical examination at 
the 3-month time point. Complete assessments for overall response, radiology, and hematology were 
reported for > 90% of subjects at the 12-month timepoint, but approximately 19% of subjects missed 
their physical examinations per lymphatic assessment due to COVID-19-related logistical restrictions. 
For the evaluation of MRD negativity rate in PB at the 12-month time point in the FD cohort, a total of 
39 subjects at the primary analysis and 9 subjects with extended follow-up did not have data available 
at the 12-month post-treatment timepoint and were thus classified as non-evaluable. For the majority 
of these subjects, the data were missing as a result of COVID-19 impact.  
None of the deviations due to COVID-19 logistical restrictions were considered as IPDs by the MAH. 
Baseline data 
 
 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the All-treated population.  
For the FD cohort, a total of 159 subjects were analyzed for efficacy; of these subjects, 136 subjects 
(85.5%) did not have del 17p; 20 subjects (12.6%) had del 17p. 
 
Outcomes and estimation 
•  Primary endpoint, CRR per investigator 
 
 
 
•  ORR 
At the primary analysis, the ORR per investigator assessment as well as IRC was 96.2% for all subjects 
and 95.6% for subjects without del 17p. For subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated, the ORR was 96.3% 
per investigator assessment as well as IRC. No change in ORR per investigator assessment 
was observed after extended follow-up. 
•  DOR 
At the primary analysis, the median durations of response per investigator assessment for the 
FD cohort were not reached for all subjects or for subjects without del 17p; the 24-month 
landmark estimates were 94.7% for all subjects and 96.1% for subjects without del 17p based on an 
overall median follow-up of 27.9 months.  
With extended follow-up, similar outcomes in DOR were observed for all subjects and subjects without 
del 17p (median not reached for both populations; 30-month landmark estimates of 88.6% and 
89.8%, respectively) based on a median follow-up of 38.7 months. 
•  MRD-negativity rate 
 
 
12 months post-treatment 
At 12 months post-treatment, the MRD negativity rate in PB was 35.2% for all subjects and 34.6% for 
subjects without del 17p. The majority of the 39 non-evaluable subjects did not have valid MRD results 
due to COVID-19 impact (ie, 18 subjects with non-evaluable samples plus 21 subjects with no sample 
taken within the required time window). At the 12-month time point, in an analysis based on evaluable 
subjects (ie, those with valid MRD results > 11 cycles after the last dose date or had no sample taken 
within the time window due to PD, initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy, death, or study 
exit), the MRD negativity rate in the PB was 46.7% for all subjects and 46.1% for subjects without del 
17p at the primary analysis.  
With extended follow-up, the MRD negativity rate in PB at 12 months post-treatment was 42.8% in all 
subjects and 43.4% for subjects without del 17p. Only 9 non-evaluable subjects remained as more 
MRD samples had been collected. Similar MRD negativity rates were observed with extended follow-up 
and collection of addition of additional samples from subjects previously not evaluable due to COVID-
19 compared to primary-analysis rates in the evaluable population (all subjects: 45.3%; subjects 
without del 17p: 45.7%). 
 
 
•  PFS 
At the primary analysis, the median PFS per investigator assessment for the FD cohort was 
not reached for all subjects or for subjects without del 17p based on an overall median follow-up 
of 27.9 months. The Kaplan-Meier point estimates at 24 months were 94.8% for all subjects and 
96.2% for non-del 17p subjects. For subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated, the median PFS was not 
reached, and the Kaplan-Meier point estimate at 24 months was 84.1%.  
At extended follow-up (overall median follow-up: 38.7 months), the median PFS per investigator 
assessment was not reached for all subjects or for subjects without del 17p, and the Kaplan-Meier 
point estimates at 36 months were 88.1% for all subjects, 89.1% for non-del 17p subjects, and 79.9% 
for subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated. 
•  OS 
At the primary analysis, the median OS for the FD cohort was not reached for all subjects or 
for subjects without del 17p based on an overall median follow-up of 27.9 months. A total of 3 deaths 
were reported (2 deaths due to cardiac events [including 1 death due treatment-emergent sudden 
death] and 1 death due to intracranial hemorrhage), with all the deaths occurring in subjects without 
del 17p. The Kaplan-Meier point estimates at 24 months were 98.1% for all subjects and 97.7% for 
non-del 17p subjects. For subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated, the median OS was not reached, and 
the Kaplan-Meier point estimate at 24 months was 96.2%. 
Analysis of OS with extended follow-up (overall median follow-up: 38.7 months indicated no change in 
the findings observed at the primary analysis for all subjects and subjects without del 17p as well as 
for subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated with no additional deaths reported. 
 
 
•  TLS risk reduction 
At baseline, hospitalization indicated per the VENCLEXTA® USPI, 2020 and VENCLYXTO® SmPC, 2020 
(based upon TLS risk and creatinine clearance) was observed for 39.6% of subjects and 17.6% of 
subjects after 3 cycles of single-agent ibrutinib lead-in therapy. For all subjects, 54.0% of subjects 
indicated for hospitalization due to TLS risk at baseline were no longer indicated for hospitalization 
after the 3-cycle ibrutinib lead-in. 
Ancillary analyses 
•  Rate of sustained hemoglobin improvement 
At the primary analysis, the proportion of subjects achieving a sustained improvement in hemoglobin 
was 41.5% for all subjects in the FD Cohort. For those subjects with anemia at baseline, the proportion 
of subjects achieving a sustained improvement in hemoglobin was 86.5%. Similar trends were 
observed after extended follow-up (ie, sustained improvement in hemoglobin observed for 45.9% of all 
subjects and 91.9% of subjects with baseline anemia. 
•  Rate of sustained platelet improvement 
At the primary analysis, the proportion of subjects achieving a sustained improvement in platelet count 
was 17.6% for all subjects in the FD Cohort. For those subjects with thrombocytopenia at baseline, the 
proportion of subjects achieving a sustained improvement in platelet count was 57.1%. Similar trends 
were observed after extended follow-up (ie, sustained improvement in platelet count observed for 
19.5% of all subjects and 61.9% of subjects with baseline thrombocytopenia). 
Summary of main study(ies) 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Analysis performed across trials 
Evaluation of the Individual Contributions of Ibrutinib and Venetoclax to the Overall Profile 
of Combination Treatment   
Given the lack of FD single-agent ibrutinib and venetoclax CLL/SLL study data to assess 
the contribution of each agent to the overall activity of the FD Ibr+Ven treatment, cross-
study comparisons of clinical data from ibrutinib and venetoclax single-agent, continuous therapy 
with Ibr+Ven combination therapy were conducted as an alternative approach to address this point. 
Of note, there are no available single-agent venetoclax data in the previously untreated 
disease setting. Therefore, key efficacy results from Ibr+Ven combination studies were compared 
with single-agent continuous ibrutinib and venetoclax studies in the relapsed/refractory setting 
to evaluate the efficacy contribution of both agents in the combination therapy.  
The following table provides an overview of the clinical studies used for the cross-study analyses. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Propensity score analysis 
A propensity score analysis (PSA) was conducted among selected relapsed CLL/SLL clinical studies. The 
efficacy endpoints CRR, ORR, PFS and OS were compared between Ibr+Ven and single agent ibrutinib, 
and between Ibr+Ven and single-agent venetoclax in the relapsed setting.    
CRR and ORR were compared by Pearson's chi-squared test. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
rate differences were provided. PFS and OS rates were compared by Log-Rank test. Hazard ratio and 
its 95% CI were calculated based on Cox regression model. Landmark estimates of 30-month PFS and 
OS rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. The 30-month landmark was selected according to 
the median follow-up time of treatment groups for PSA (in the analysis population consisting of CLL 
subjects with 1 to 6 prior lines of therapy only): 
Ibr+Ven Pool 36 months 
•  VISION 34 months 
• 
• 
•  Ven Pool 33 months 
PCYC-1112 66 months 
Propensity scores were estimated using a logistic regression with the binary treatment assignment 
(T=1~Ibr+Ven and T=0~single-agent) as a dependent variable and selected prognostic factors as 
covariates. Similarity in the subjects between the treatment arm and the control arm are measured 
using the overlap coefficient defined as the overlapping area of the estimated marginal propensity 
score density curves per arm. 
Four PSA methods were used. Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting on the Average Treatment 
Effect (IPTW-ATE), Average Effect of the Treatment on the Treated (ATT) Weighting, Overlap 
Weighting (OW) and Propensity Score Matching (PSM). IPTW-ATE was treated as the primary method 
for analyses while ATT Weighting, OW, and PSM were treated as sensitivity analyses. 
Multiplicities were adjusted by Holm’s procedure within each paired treatment comparison for each 
endpoint at 2-sided 0.05 alpha level. 
Table XX: Summary of Propensity Score Methods Used for the Propensity Score Analysis 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table XX: Summary of propensity score models 
The MAH used 4 different computational methods for the PSA, Inverse Probability of Treatment 
Weighting on the Average Treatment Effect (IPTW-ATE) as the primary method for analysis. 
Analyses are performed both including and excluding the single arm study Clarity. Also, three 
different models were used for baseline variables. The statistical methodology is considered 
appropriate, but substantial residual bias cannot be excluded, especially since data for the 
different treatment arms were from different data sources. 
Results  
 
 
 
Persistance of efficacy and/or tolerance effects   
•  PFS rates were maintained after treatment completion 
In Study CLL3011, with a median follow-up of 27.7 months at the primary analysis, PFS was 
significantly improved with FD Ibr+Ven compared with Clb+Ob (HR: 0.216; 95% CI: 0.131, 0.357; 
p<0.0001). Kaplan-Meier PFS rate estimates per IRC at 24 months (ie 10 months after treatment 
completion of Ibr+Ven and Clb+Ob) were 84.4% for the Ibr+Ven arm and 44.1% for the Clb+Ob arm.  
With extended follow up (median follow-up of 34.1 months), the improvement in PFS for Ibr+Ven was 
maintained with a HR of 0.212 (95% CI: 0.129, 0.349). The median PFS was not reached for the 
Ibr+Ven arm and was 23.7 months for the Clb+Ob arm. The Kaplan-Meier PFS rate estimate at 30 
months was 80.5% for the Ibr+Ven arm and 35.8% for the Clb+Ob arm, demonstrating persistence of 
Ibr+Ven of PFS benefit at least 15 months after the end of treatment with Ibr+Ven.  
Results from Study 1142 corroborate these observations with a Kaplan-Meier PFS rate estimate per 
IRC at 24 months of 88.9% for all subjects and 90.8% for subjects without del17p at a median follow-
up of 27.9 months at the primary analysis.  
 
 
With extended follow-up (median follow-up of 38.7 months), Kaplan-Meier PFS rate estimates at 36 
months (22 months post-treatment) were 85.5% for all subjects and 86.0%, for subjects without 
del17p. 
•  MRD Negativity Rates Sustained from 3 to 12 Months Post-treatment  
The MRD negativity rates at 3 months post-treatment as assessed by NGS in Study CLL3011 were 
substantially higher with Ibr+Ven arm versus Clb+Ob in both the BM (51.9% vs 17.1%; respectively) 
and PB (54.7% vs 39.0%; respectively).  
At 12 months post-treatment, the MRD negativity rates in PB in the Ibr+Ven arm and the Clb+Ob arms 
were 49.1% vs 12.4%, respectively. Similar sustained results for Ibr+Ven were observed by flow 
cytometry with MRD negativity rates of 61.3% for Ibr+Ven and 41.0% for Clb+Ob in PB at 3 months 
post-treatment and 54.7% for Ibr+Ven and 16.2% for Clb+Ob at 12 months post-treatment. These 
data indicate that the MRD negativity was sustained with Ibr+Ven throughout the first year 
after treatment completion while substantially decreased for subjects in the Clb+Ob arm.  
In the FD cohort of Study 1142, at 3 months post-treatment, the MRD negativity rates were 52.2% in 
the BM and 56.6% in the PB. With extended follow-up and the collection of additional samples, the 
MRD negativity rate in the PB at 12-months post treatment was 42.8% (9 subjects still had 
missing samples primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic). 
•  Duration of CR after treatment is completed 
In Study CLL3011 at the primary analysis, FD Ibr+Ven resulted in significantly higher CR rates (CR or 
CRi) per IRC assessment compared with Clb+Ob (38.7% vs. 11.4%, respectively; p<0.0001). The 12-
month landmark estimate for IRC-assessed duration of CR was 100% in the Ibr+Ven arm and 91.7% 
in the Clb+Ob arm. At extended follow-up, the 18-month landmark estimates for IRC-assessed 
duration of CR were 97.5% in the Ibr+Ven arm and 84.6% in the Clb+Ob arm.  
Similar results were observed for the FD cohort in Study 1142. At the primary analysis, the CR rate per 
IRC assessment for all subjects was 59.7% (95% CI: 52.1, 67.4) and 61.0% (95% CI: 52.8, 69.2) for 
subjects without del17p. With a median follow-up of 27.9 months, the 18-month landmark estimates 
were 95.2% for all subjects and 95.7% without del17p. With extended follow-up (median: 38.7 
months), the 30-month landmark estimates were 83.0% for all subjects and 81.6%, for subjects 
without del17p.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
To support an unrestricted indication of FD ibr+ven in previously untreated CLL the outcomes of 2 
main studies were reported: 
−  The randomized open study 3011 comparing FD ibr+ven (n=106) with clb+obi (n=105) in 
subjects ≥65 years of age or younger with comorbidities, excluding del17p/TP53 mutated 
disease. The primary outcome was IRC-assessed PFS. 
−  The FD cohort of study 1142, a SAT investigating FD ibr+ven in fit patients (n=159 whereof 27 
with del17p/TP53 mutated disease). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed CRR. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Regarding the 3011 study, the study entry criteria define a population appropriate for treatment with 
the control regimen. Venetoclax, chlorambucil and obinutuzumab were administrated according to EU 
label in untreated disease.  
The statistical methods are generally considered acceptable. The assumption that all types of censoring 
are considered non-informative might be disputable. However, as further discussed below, censoring 
due to other reasons than study cut off were rare in the primary analysis.  
The primary estimand had a treatment policy strategy for handling the intercurrent events of 
treatment discontinuation, use of subsequent anti-cancer therapy and a composite variable strategy is 
adopted for handling the intercurrent events of pre-PD death (PFS event) due to COVID-19. This is 
considered appropriate. Supplementary analyses with hypothetical strategies for subsequent anti-
cancer therapy and death due to Covid-19 were provided. The clear presentation of methods within the 
estimand framework, provided by the MAH, is appreciated.

The clear presentation of methods within the estimand framework, provided by the MAH, is 
appreciated. Multiplicity was controlled using a serial gatekeeping procedure, which is acceptable. No 
interim analysis was performed. The primary estimator is stratified on the randomisation stratification 
variables, which is supported. 
Regarding the FD cohort of the 1142 study, enrolment criteria are acceptable. Previously untreated 
subjects 18-70 93 
 with CLL/SLL in ECOG PS 0-2 with or without del 17p or TP53 mutation were recruited. The treatment 
was identical to the experimental regimen in study 3011.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 3011 
In the control arm, 6 cycles of treatment were received, corresponding to ≈168 days or a little less 
than 6 months. In the experimental arm, ibrutinib was administrated for a total of 15 cycles 
(15x28=420 days, corresponding to approximately 14 months) and venetoclax was introduced after 3 
cycles of ibrutinib monotherapy as an attempt to reduce frequency/severity of tumour lysis syndrome 
(TLS). This means that a SOC treatment of ≈6 months duration is compared to an experimental 
regimen of ≈14 months duration.  
The amendments and changes to protocol-specified analyses are not considered to challenge the 
integrity of the study, and numbers of subjects with major protocol deviations were similar in the study 
arms and deemed unlikely to have a major impact on study outcomes. The potential impact of the 
COVID-19-related missed/delayed DE visits on study integrity and outcomes is difficult to dissect but 
with the large effect size noted with the primary analysis it is deemed unlikely that these have 
substantially altered the outcome estimations. 
The primary analysis was event-driven, planned after 71 observed events, and based on a cut-off on 
26 February 2021 with a median follow-up of ~28 months. An analysis with extended follow-up was 
also provided, cut-off 19 August 2021 with a median follow-up of ~34 months. 
The experimental regimen was statistically superior over control in terms of PFS, HR=0.216 (95% 
CI: 0.131, 0.357); p<0.0001, at the primary analysis by IRC, with an event rate of 64% for the control 
arm, and supported by presented alternative analyses, and a generally consistent treatment effect is 
noted in the predefined subgroups. By an additional follow-up of 6 months, the outcome remains 
stable.  
Best MRD response in bone marrow (assessed by NGS showed a response rate of 55.7% in the 
experimental arm and 21.0% in the control arm, rate ratio 2.65 (95% CI: 1.75, 3.99); p<0.0001. 
The CR (CR and CRi) rate was significantly higher in the experimental arm, 38.7% vs 11.4% in the 
control arm; rate ratio 3.42 (95% CI: 2.01, 5.82); p<0.0001. 
Based on a data cut-off of 17 January 2022 for Study CLL3011 with a median time on study of 39 
months and a maturity of 21% in the control arm and 11% in the experimental arm, the HR for OS 
was estimated at 0.582 (95% CI: 0.286, 1.187). At the August 2021 cut-off, the HR for OS was 0.760 
(0.352, 1.642). Thus, with 5 months further follow-up after the August 2021 cut-off, the positive trend 
observed with the August 2021 data cut favouring the experimental treatment is maintained in this 
updated analysis and no longer-term detrimental effect on OS is noted. 
FD cohort of study 1142 
The amendments are not considered to challenge the integrity of the study. At confirmed PD, ibrutinib 
monotherapy or, if >2 years since completion of study therapy, ibrutinib+venetoclax for 15 cycles FD 
could be (re)introduced. 
The primary analysis was planned when the last enrolled subject had the opportunity to be followed for 
at least 30 cycles (15 cycles of treatment + 15 cycles of posttreatment follow-up) and based on a data 
extract on 12 November 2020, with a median follow-up of ~28 months. An analysis with extended 
follow-up was also provided, cut-off 4 August 2021 with a median follow-up of ~39 months. 
At the primary analysis, the CRR per investigator for all subjects was 55.9% (95% CI: 47.5, 64.2) for 
subjects without del 17p (the primary analysis set). The CR rate for subjects without del 17p was 
significantly higher than the study-assumed minimum rate of 37% (1-sided p-value < 0.0001) as well 
as the 40% rate achieved in this population with FCR. CRR in del 17p/TP53 mutated disease (n=27) 
was similar to the complement, 56%. With extended follow-up, CRR was 58% per investigator and 
64% per IRC in the non-del17 population. 
The median DOR per investigator assessment was not reached for all subjects or for subjects without 
del 17p.  
With MRD assessed by flow cytometry in the all-treated population, the overall negativity rate was 
60% in BM and 77% in PB. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The broad indication sought in previously untreated CLL is, from an efficacy perspective considered 
supported by sufficiently robust data, as well as by precedent decision in the field of CLL.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy:> 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety data in support of this application is derived from 2 studies, as follows: 
•  Study CLL3011 (N=211) is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter, international, 
efficacy and safety study of Ibr+Ven (N=106) versus Clb+Ob (N=105) in subjects with 
treatment-naïve CLL/SLL without del17p or known TP53 mutation. 
•  Study 1142 (N=323) is a Phase 2, multicenter, international, efficacy and safety study 
assessing Ibr+Ven in subjects with treatment-naïve CLL/SLL (with or without del17p/TP53 
mutation) in a FD treatment cohort (FD cohort) and an MRD-guided treatment discontinuation 
cohort (MRD cohort) that included a pre-randomization and randomization phase. In the pre-
randomization phase of the MRD cohort, subjects received ibrutinib and venetoclax as 
described above for the FD cohort plus an additional cycle of Ibr+Ven (Cycle 16) before 
 
proceeding with randomization and further treatment. Safety data from the FD cohort (N=159) 
were pooled with safety data from the pre-randomization phase of the MRD cohort (N=164) 
with 16 cycles of treatment, as these treatments and TEAE collection periods were similar. 
Safety data are presented based on the primary analysis data cut-off date for each study (Study 
CLL3011: 26 February 2021; Study 1142: 12 November 2020). Where applicable, safety data from an 
extended follow-up analysis are presented with data cut-off dates as follows: study CLL3011: 19 
August 2021, representing an additional 6 months of follow-up; study 1142: 04 August 2021, 
representing an additional 9 months of follow-up.  
Alongside the safety data from both studies, the MAH has provided safety data for the so-called 
Current Label Pool, representing integrated safety data for 1552 patients treated with ibrutinib as 
monotherapy or in combination therapy across the 10 studies that form the basis of the currently 
authorized indications for ibrutinib (MCL, CLL, and WM) in the ibrutinib EU SmPC:  
•  CLL: Studies 1102, 1112, 1115, 1130, E1912, and CLL3001 
•  WM: Studies 1118E and 1127 (arms A [Ibr+R] and C [ibrutinib monotherapy]) 
•  MCL: Studies 1104 and MCL3001.  
Considering the heterogeneity in the Current Label Pool in terms of therapeutic setting and treatment 
(ibrutinib as monotherapy or in combination therapy) and the difference in treatment duration (fixed 
duration in the current data set vs. treatment until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity in the 
Current Label Pool), a comparison of safety data is not considered informative and will not be further 
discussed.  
Patient exposure 
In Study CLL3011 and in the FD cohort of Study 1142, single-agent ibrutinib 420 mg/day was 
administered for 3 cycles followed by TLS risk assessment and subsequent Ibr+Ven combination 
treatment for 12 cycles (with a 5 week venetoclax dose titration to 400 mg/day once daily as described 
in the Venclyxto SmPC), using the approved doses of both medicinal products for subjects with 
previously untreated CLL/SLL (Imbruvica SmPC; Venclyxto SmPC). In the pre-randomization phase of 
the MRD cohort of Study 1142, this was followed by 1 cycle (Cycle 16) of Ibr+Ven, during which MRD 
status was assessed and confirmed prior to the randomization phase of the MRD cohort. In study 
CLL3011, subjects randomly assigned to Clb+Ob treatment received 6 cycles (28 days/cycle) of in the 
absence of PD or treatment-limiting toxicity.

Primary analysis 
In Study CLL3011, the median time on study was 27.6 months for the Ibr+Ven arm and 27.8 months 
for the Clb+Ob arm.  
In Study 1142, the median time on study was 27.9 months in the FD cohort and 14.8 months in the 
pre-randomization phase (ie, first 16 cycles) of the MRD cohort.  
Extended follow-up 
The treatment disposition profile remained the same with extended follow-up for both Study CLL3011 
and FD cohort of Study 1142 (all subjects were off treatment before the primary analysis), as well as 
the first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142 (all subjects had completed the pre-randomization 
phase before the primary analysis).  
 
Adverse events 
Table 8. Overall summary of TEAEs 
Common TEAEs 
 
Table 9. Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Occurring in 10% or More Subjects 
 
In Study CLL3011, the most common TEAEs (≥20% of subjects) in the Ibr+Ven arm were diarrhea 
(50.9%), neutropenia (34.0%), and nausea (26.4%). The most common TEAEs (≥20% of subjects) in 
the Clb+Ob arm were neutropenia (53.3%), infusion-related reaction (29.5%), thrombocytopenia 
(26.7%), and nausea (25.7%). Adverse events that were reported more frequently (≥10% difference) 
in the Ibr+Ven arm versus the Clb+Ob arm were diarrhea (50.9% vs. 12.4%, respectively), rash 
(17.0% vs. 6.7%), urinary tract infections (16.0% vs. 4.8%), peripheral edema (15.1% vs. 2.9%), 
atrial fibrillation (14.2% vs. 1.9%), and hyperphosphatemia (10.4% vs. 0%). Adverse events that 
were reported more frequently (≥10% difference) in the Clb+Ob arm versus the Ibr+Ven arm were 
neutropenia (53.3% vs. 34.0%, respectively), thrombocytopenia (26.7% vs. 11.3%), infusion-related 
reaction (29.5% vs. 0%), and pyrexia (19.0% vs. 6.6%). 
In the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142, the most common TEAE (≥20% of 
subjects) were diarrhea (66.6%), nausea (44.0%), neutropenia (42.1%), arthralgia (33.7%), 
headache (26.6%), upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue (26.3% each), muscle spasms (24.5%), 
increased tendency to bruise, and vomiting (21.7% each).  
Common TEAEs by 3-month Intervals 
In Study CLL3011, the prevalence rates for common TEAEs were generally stable or decreased over 
the 3-month time intervals during the study. In the Ibr+Ven arm, increased prevalence rates from the 
Day 1-90 interval to the Day 91-180 interval were observed, with the addition of venetoclax to 
ibrutinib, for diarrhea (22.9% vs 38.2%), nausea (12.5% vs 21.3%), and neutropenia (6.3% vs 
23.6%). The prevalence rate for hypertension increased over time from 6.3% at the Day 1-90 interval 
to 9.7% at the Day ≥366 interval. 
In the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142, the prevalence rates for common 
TEAEs were generally stable or decreased over the 3-month time intervals during the study. Increased 
 
prevalence rates from the Day 1-90 interval to the Day 91-180 interval were observed, with the 
addition of venetoclax to ibrutinib, for diarrhea (33.1% vs 50.6%), nausea (19.3% vs 31.1%), and 
neutropenia (8.9% vs 33.0%). The prevalence rate increased over time for gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (5.9% at the Day 1-90 interval to 9.5% at the Day ≥366 interval) and hypertension (4.3% at 
the Day 1-90 interval to 11.0% at the Day ≥366 interval). 
The prevalence rates for common TEAEs over the 3-month time intervals of Ibr+Ven subjects in Study 
CLL3011 and the FD cohort + the first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142 were generally 
similar to those of the Current Label Pool, with stable or decreasing rates over time. Of note, the 
clinically meaningful increases in prevalence rates with the addition of venetoclax to ibrutinib (ie, from 
the Day 1-90 interval to the Day 91-180 interval) observed in the Ibr+Ven arm of Study CLL3011 and 
the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142 were not observed for the Current 
Label Pool (diarrhea: 32.2% [Day 1-90] and 18.4% [Day 91-180]; nausea: 21.2% [Day1-90] and 
11.8% [Day 91-180]; neutropenia 18.8% [Day 1-90] and 21.0% [Day 91-180]). Consistent with the 
Ibr+Ven arm of Study CLL3011 and the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142, 
the prevalence rate for hypertension increased over time from 3.7% at the Day 1-90 interval to 10.6% 
at the Day ≥366 interval for the Current Label Pool.  
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs 
Table 10. Incidence of grade 3 or 4 TEAEs 
In Study CLL3011, the proportion of subjects with Grade 3 or higher TEAEs was similar in the Ibr+Ven 
and Clb+Ob arms (75.5% and 69.5% respectively). The most common events (≥5% of subjects) in 
the Ibr+Ven arm were neutropenia (28.3%), diarrhea (10.4%), neutrophil count decreased (8.5%), 
hypertension (7.5%), atrial fibrillation and pneumonia (6.6% each), and hyponatremia and 
thrombocytopenia (5.7% each). For the Clb+Ob arm, the most commonly occurring Grade 3 or higher 
TEAEs were neutropenia (44.8%), thrombocytopenia (20.0%), neutrophil count decreased (6.7%), and 
pneumonia and TLS (5.7% each). 
 
In the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142, Grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurred 
in 64.7% of subjects; the most common events (≥5% of subjects) were neutropenia (34.1%), and 
hypertension (6.8%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Table 11. Incidence of SAEs 
In Study CLL3011, the proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent serious adverse events was 
higher in the Ibr+Ven arm compared with the Clb+Ob arm (46.2% vs. 27.6%, respectively). Within 
the first 6 months after the start of study treatment, which approximates the treatment duration for 
Clb+Ob, serious adverse events were reported in 34.0% and 26.7% of subjects in the Ibr+Ven and 
Clb+Ob arms, respectively.  
The proportion of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 serious adverse events was 32.1% in the Ibr+Ven arm 
and 20.0% in the Clb+Ob arm. Overall, the most commonly occurring serious adverse events (≥2% of 
subjects) were atrial fibrillation (6.6%), pneumonia (5.7%), anemia (2.8%), cardiac failure (2.8%), 
and diarrhea (2.8%) in the Ibr+Ven arm and pneumonia (5.7%), febrile neutropenia (2.9%), infusion-
related reaction (2.9%), and TLS (2.9%) in the Clb+Ob arm. As of the data cut off for extended follow-
up, 2 additional treatment-emergent serious adverse events (MDS and MPN) were reported in 1 
subject in the Clb+Ob arm.  
In the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142, treatment-emergent serious 
adverse events were reported in 21.7% of subjects; the proportion of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 
serious adverse events was 18.0%. Overall, the most commonly occurring treatment-emergent serious 
adverse events (≥ 1% of subjects) were pneumonia, atrial fibrillation (1.9% each), cellulitis and febrile 
neutropenia (1.2% each).  
Deaths 
 
Table 12. Summary of all deaths 
Table 13. Deaths within 30 days of last dose 
In Study CLL3011, the overall incidence of death due to any reason was 10.4% in the Ibr+Ven arm 
and 11.4% in the Clb+Ob arm. Seven subjects (6.6%) in the Ibr+Ven arm died while on study 
treatment or within the 30-day period after the last dose of study treatment.  
As of the data cut-off for extended follow-up, a total of 27 deaths due to any reason were observed 
with 10.4% in the Ibr+Ven arm and 15.2% in the Clb+Ob arm.  
In the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142, the overall incidence of death due 
to any reason was 0.9%. One subject (0.3%) died while on study treatment or within the 30-day 
period after the last dose of study treatment.  
Deaths due to TEAEs 
In Study CLL3011, fatal TEAEs were reported in 7 (6.6%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 2 (1.9%) 
subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. Among the 7 deaths in the Ibr+Ven arm, 4 occurred during lead-in 
treatment with ibrutinib. In 2 of these cases (PTs: metastatic carcinoma, pneumonia), the adverse 
events were likely present at baseline and unrelated to study treatment. Among the 3 deaths from a 
fatal TEAE that occurred during combination treatment with Ibr+Ven, one (PT: ischemic stroke) had an 
autopsy that revealed obliterating atherosclerosis as the potential cause of death. The chronic nature 
of atherosclerosis development argues against the death being related to an acute study drug-related 
effect. The 4 remaining treatment-emergent deaths from the Ibr+Ven arm were either cardiac (PTs: 
cardiac arrest [n=1] and cardiac failure, pneumonia, sinus node dysfunction, in 1 subject) or 
potentially cardiac in nature (PT: sudden death [n=2]). All these 4 subjects had a baseline CIRS score 
≥10 or an ECOG performance status of 2 and all of them had underlying baseline cardiac risks. In 
addition, the majority of subjects in the study had hypertension (66.8%) and/or metabolism disorders 
(57.8%) that increase the risk for cardiovascular complications with any antineoplastic treatment. 
Overall, with 3 of the 7 treatment emergent deaths in the Ibr+Ven arm unlikely to be related to study 
treatment, the early imbalance in death cases may be overestimated. Although the 4 other deaths are 
 
 
 
confounded by pre-existing medical conditions, a potential association with ibrutinib cannot be ruled 
out.  
In Study 1142, 1 (0.3%) subject in the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort had a TEAE of 
sudden death with a fatal outcome. The event was considered related to study treatment by the 
investigator. The medical examiner concluded the death was due to natural causes based on the 
available information.

Case narratives for study CLL3011 (source: CSR CLL3011) 
Ibr+Ven arm: 
During ibrutinib lead-in: 
•  Subject xxxxx (xxx-year-old man; PT: pneumonia): The subject’s medical history included 
atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral edema. The subject had a 
baseline CIRS score of 12 and an ECOG PS of 1. On Study Day -1, Grade 3 pulmonary edema 
and Grade 2 pleural effusion were noted, and study treatment was initiated on the next day. 
On Study Day 34, the subject developed progressive dyspnea and was hospitalized for Grade 3 
pneumonia. On Study Day 42, the study treatment was permanently discontinued due to 
pneumonia. On Study Day 45, Grade 3 lung abscess was reported, and 8 days later, on Study

decompensation, and Grade 4 cardiac failure, pneumonia, and sinus node dysfunction were 
reported. On Study Day 74, the subject died from these events. 
 
•  Subject xxxxx (xxx-year-old woman; PT: malignant neoplasm): The subject had a baseline 
CIRS score of 10 and an ECOG PS of 1. On Study Day 41, the subject was hospitalized for 
Grade 3 malignant neoplasm and Grade 3 arthralgia. CT imaging showed new pleural nodules 
and a right pleural effusion. On Study Day 65, pleural biopsy confirmed the presence of 
squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary origin. On Study Day 78, the subject died from 
the malignant neoplasm. 
•  Subject xxxxx (xxx-year-old man; PT: cardiac arrest): The subject’s cardiovascular history 
included hypertension. The subject had a baseline CIRS score of 10 and an ECOG PS of 1. On 
Study Day 85, the subject was electively hospitalized for initiation of venetoclax treatment. 
Before the first dose of venetoclax was administered, the subject went into cardiac arrest. 
Ventricular fibrillation was noted during resuscitation. Coronary angiography, CT pulmonary 
angiogram, and CT imaging of the head were unremarkable. On Study Day 89, the subject 
died from the cardiac arrest. 
During ibrutinib + venetoclax treatment: 
•  Subject xxxxx (xxx-year-old women; PT: ischemic stroke): The subject’s cardiovascular 
history included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The subject had 
a baseline CIRS score of 8 and an ECOG PS of 1. On Study Day 84, the subject presented with 
Grade 2 atrial fibrillation which resolved on Study Day 113. On Study Day 220, the subject was 
reported to have died from a serious adverse event of ischemic stroke. Autopsy revealed an 
obliterating atherosclerotic lesion in the brain. The investigator confirmed that no embolic 
event was identified. 
•  Subject xxxxx (xxx-year-old man; PT: sudden death): The subject’s medical history included 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure. The subject had a baseline CIRS 
score of 13 and an ECOG PS of 2. On Study Day 224, the subject’s pre-existing chronic renal 
failure worsened to Grade 3. Treatment with venetoclax was interrupted. On Study Day 226, 
ibrutinib treatment was interrupted in preparation for an elective kidney biopsy. On Study Day 
230 (and before the biopsy could be performed), sudden death was reported. 
•  Subject xxxxx (xxx-year-old man; PT: sudden death): The subject’s medical history included 
atrial fibrillation. The subject had a baseline CIRS score of 5 and an ECOG PS of 2. On Study 
Day 239, the subject was reported to have died from sudden death. The subject lived alone, 
and relatives reported that the subject complained of fatigue a few days prior to death. No 
further information was provided, and an autopsy was not performed.  
Clb+Ob arm:  
•  Subject xxxxx (xxx-year-old man; PT: pneumonia): The subject´s medical history included 
asthma, angina pectoris, arteriosclerosis, atrial flutter, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. 
The subject had a baseline CIRS score of 13 and an ECOG PS of 1. On Study Day −18, the 
subject was hospitalized for Grade 3 pneumonia which resolved on Study Day −9. On Study 
Day 94, the subject was re-hospitalized for Grade 3 pneumonia and supraventricular 
tachycardia. On Study Day 107, the subject was discharged to a rehabilitation center, and re-
admitted for persistent pneumonia on Study Day 113. On Study Day 121, Grade 2 cryptogenic 
organizing pneumonia was reported. On Study Day 157, the subject died from the pneumonia.  
•  Subject xxxxx (xxx-year-old man; PT: cholestasis): The subject had a baseline CIRS score of 
4 and an ECOG PS status of 1. On Study Day 75, the subject developed elevated ALP. CT 
imaging on Study Day 84 revealed a new hepatic lesion. Subsequent laboratory testing showed 
elevated hepatic transaminases and elevated GGT. On Study Day 113, a liver biopsy revealed 
transformation of CLL to Hodgkin lymphoma and study treatment was permanently 
discontinued. On Study Day 117, Grade 3 spinal cord compression was reported. On Study Day 
155, the subject died due to the cholestasis.  
Case narratives for study 1142 
In the FD cohort, 1 subject experienced sudden death within the first month of the study, which was 
during the 3-cycle ibrutinib lead-in period.  
•  Subject xxxxx (xxx-year-old man; PT: sudden death): This subject had a history of tobacco 
use (approximately 16 cigarettes/day) and an ongoing medical history including hypertension, 
gastrointestinal reflux disease, insomnia, depression, hyperlipidemia, and congenital heart 
disease (atrioventricular malformation). This subject died in his sleep on Day 23. The autopsy 
report indicated that the cause of death was cardiomegaly and coronary artery disease in a 
man with CLL. In summary, the medical examiner concluded the death was due to natural 
causes based on the available information. The event was assessed by the investigator as 
possibly related to ibrutinib. Adverse events of clinical interest and other safety 
observations 
Haemorrhage 
Treatment-emergent bleeding events were identified by hemorrhage (excluding laboratory terms) 
standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) search. Major hemorrhage TEAEs were defined as Grade 3 or 
higher, or serious, or central nervous system hemorrhage of any grade identified by manual safety 
review.

In the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142, hemorrhagic TEAEs occurred in 
60.7% of subjects. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic TEAEs (≥ 5% of subjects) were 
increased tendency to bruise (21.7%), contusion (17.0%), epistaxis (13.0%), and petechiae (11.5%). 
Major hemorrhage events were reported for 1.5% of subjects (cerebral hemorrhage, eye hemorrhage, 
hemorrhagic cerebral infarction, menorrhagia, and retinal hemorrhage; 0.3% each) and none were 
fatal. 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
Table 17. Incidence of treatment-emergent tumour lysis syndrome 
No TEAEs of TLS were reported for subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm versus 6 (5.7%) subjects with TLS in 
the Clb+Ob arm in Study CLL3011. Three (2.9%) subjects had serious TLS events. Hospitalization for 
TLS prophylaxis after ibrutinib lead-in was reported for 55.7% of subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm. 
Although no TEAEs of TLS were reported for subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm, review of laboratory data 
identified 4 subjects that met Howard criteria for laboratory TLS. No subject met Howard criteria for 
clinical TLS. 
 
 
A TEAE of TLS occurred in 1 subject in the FD cohort + the first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 
1142. This subject experienced non-serious Grade 3 laboratory TLS but did not have any evidence of 
acute kidney injury or reports of any other events consistent with clinical TLS per Howard criteria. The 
TLS event was transient in nature; no treatment discontinuation or dose reduction was performed due 
to this event. No clinical symptoms or corrective measures (eg, fluid hydration, phosphate binders) 
were reported. In addition, this subject did not receive any TLS prophylaxis.  
Cytopenic Events

Infections including viral reactivation 
All infection TEAEs 
In Study CLL3011, a higher proportion of subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm (60.4%) than the Clb+Ob arm 
(48.6%) had TEAEs within the SOC of Infections and infestations. Treatment-emergent infection 
events reported in ≥10% of subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm were urinary tract infection (16.0%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (12.3%), and pneumonia (10.4%). Similarly, for the Clb+Ob arm, upper 
respiratory tract infection (13.3%) was reported in ≥10% of subjects. The proportion of subjects with 
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs within the SOC of Infections and infestations were 15.1% in the Ibr+Ven arm and 
10.5% in the Clb+Ob arm. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 infection was pneumonia, with 
similar proportions between the Ibr+Ven arm and Clb+Ob arm (4.7% and 4.8%, respectively). Serious 
adverse events of any grade in the SOC of Infections and infestations were reported for 12.3% of 
subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 8.6% of subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. The most frequently reported 
serious adverse event of infection was pneumonia, reported in 5.7% of subjects in both arms. Two 
(1.9%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 1 (1.0%) subject in the Clb+Ob arm were reported with fatal 
pneumonia. 
In Study 1142, 69.7% of subjects had TEAEs within the SOC of Infections and infestations. Treatment-
emergent infection event reported in ≥10% of subjects was upper respiratory tract infection (26.3%). 
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs within the SOC of Infections and infestations were reported for 8.4% of subjects. 
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 infection was pneumonia (1.9%). Serious adverse events of 
any grade in the SOC of Infections and infestations were reported for 8.0% of subjects. The most 
frequently reported serious adverse events of infection was pneumonia, reported in 1.9% of subjects. 
 
Two subjects (0.6%) discontinued ibrutinib due to an infection TEAE. No subjects had an infection 
TEAE with a fatal outcome. 
Table 19. Incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs of infections (Table abbreviated by the assessor) 
Viral reactivation TEAEs 
In Study CLL3011 and in the FD cohort + the first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort for Study 1142, there 
were no treatment-emergent reports of hepatitis B reactivation. 
Sepsis 
Sepsis events were identified by PTs containing sepsis, bacteremia, fungaemia, viraemia, or septic 
(excluding septic screen or aseptic).  
In Study CLL3011, treatment-emergent septic shock was reported in 1 (0.9%) subject in the Ibr+Ven 
arm and pneumococcal sepsis was reported in 1 (1.0%) subject in the Clb+Ob arm. Both events were 
serious and Grade 3 or 4 in severity. No subjects had ibrutinib dose reductions as a result of sepsis 
events, and the PT of septic shock led to ibrutinib discontinuation in 1 (0.9%) subject.  
In the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142, 3 subjects (0.9%) experienced 
treatment-emergent sepsis (ie, 1 subject with bacteremia, 1 subject with Escherichia bacteremia, 1 
subject with Staphylococcal bacteremia). Of these events, 2 events (Escherichia bacteremia and 
Staphylococcal bacteremia) were Grade 3 or 4 in severity. Two (0.6%) subjects had serious sepsis 
events and none of the events were fatal. No subjects had ibrutinib dose reductions or ibrutinib 
discontinuation as a result of sepsis events.  
Cardiac arrhythmias 
Atrial Fibrillation 
In Study CLL3011, the proportion of subjects with atrial fibrillation (based on the PT of atrial 
fibrillation) was higher in the Ibr+Ven arm (14.2%) compared with the Clb+Ob arm (1.9%). Grade 3 
or 4 TEAEs of atrial fibrillation were reported in 7 (6.6%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and no subjects 
in the Clb+Ob arm. Similarly, atrial fibrillation as a serious adverse event was reported in 7 (6.6%) 
subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and no subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. There were no fatal atrial fibrillation 
events. Atrial fibrillation led to ibrutinib discontinuation in 2 (1.9%) subjects, ibrutinib dose reduction 
in 1 subject (0.9%). None of the subjects with a TEAE of atrial fibrillation had an action taken against 
venetoclax nor a discontinuation of study treatment due to the event. 
In Study 1142, treatment-emergent atrial fibrillation was reported for 5.9% of subjects. Five subjects 
(1.5%) had Grade 3 or 4 atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation as a serious adverse event was reported in 
6 (1.9%) subjects. There were no fatal atrial fibrillation events. Atrial fibrillation led to ibrutinib 
discontinuation for 1 subject (0.3%).  
 
 
Table 20. Incidence of treatment-emergent ventricular tachyarrhythmia 
In Study CLL3011, no TEAEs of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (based on the ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia SMQ search) were reported.  
In Study 1142, ventricular tachyarrhythmias TEAEs occurred in 3 subjects (0.9%), with ventricular 
extrasystoles, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia (serious) observed in individual 
subjects (0.3% each). Events of ventricular tachyarrhythmia did not result in ibrutinib dose reduction 
for any subjects. For 2 subject (0.6%), events of Grade 3 or 4 ventricular fibrillation or ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia resulted in ibrutinib discontinuation.  
Other Cardiac Arrhythmias (excluding atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias) 
 
Table 21. Incidence of treatment-emergent cardiac arrhythmias (excluding atrial fibrillation and 
ventricular tachyarrhythmia) 
In Study CLL3011, cardiac arrhythmias (identified by the cardiac arrhythmia SMQ excluding the 
preferred term of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias) were reported for 15 subjects (14.2%) 
in the Ibr+Ven arm and 11 subjects (10.5%) in the Clb+Ob arm. The PT of palpitations was reported 
in 6 (5.7%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 3 (2.9%) of subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. All other PTs 
were reported in 1 or 2 subjects in either treatment arm. The proportion of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 
TEAEs of cardiac arrhythmias was similar between the Ibr+Ven arm and Clb+Ob arm (3 [2.8%] and 2 
[1.9%] subjects, respectively). Fatal cardiac arrhythmias were reported in 4 (3.8%) subjects in the 
Ibr+Ven arm and no subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. The fatal events were sudden death (2 [1.9%] 
subjects), cardiac arrest (1 [0.9%] subject), and sinus node dysfunction (1 [0.9%] subject). No 
subjects had ibrutinib dose reductions as a result of cardiac arrhythmias, and 4 (3.8%) subjects had 
ibrutinib treatment discontinuation as a result of cardiac arrhythmias (2 [1.9%] subjects with the PT of 
sudden death and 1 [0.9%] subject each with PTs of fatal sinus node dysfunction and non-fatal cardiac 
arrest). 
 
In Study 1142, cardiac arrhythmias excluding the preferred term of atrial fibrillation and ventricular 
arrhythmias, were reported for 56 subjects (17.3%) in the FD cohort + the first 16 cycles of the MRD 
cohort, with 2.2% having a Grade 3 or 4 event. The PT of palpitations was reported in 36 (11.1%) 
subjects, and sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, and syncope in 4 (1.2%) subjects each. All other 
PTs were reported in 1 to 3 subjects. Fatal cardiac arrhythmias were reported in 1 (0.3%) subject 
(sudden death). One subject had an ibrutinib dose reduction as a result of palpitations. Ibrutinib 
treatment discontinuation resulted from cardiac arrest in 2 subjects (0.6%) and sinus arrest in 1 
subject (0.3%).  
Cardiac failure 
Table 22. Incidence of treatment-emergent cardiac failure 
In Study CLL3011, treatment-emergent cardiac failure events (identified by cardiac failure SMQ narrow 
search) were reported in 5 (4.7%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 1 (1.0%) subject in the Clb+Ob 
arm. All of these subjects had multiple comorbidities including cardiac disorders and/or hypertension at 
baseline. Grade 3 or 4 cardiac failure was reported in 3 (2.8%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 1 
(1.0%) subject in the Clb+Ob arm. One subject in the Ibr+Ven arm was reported with a fatal cardiac 
failure event (0.9%), this subject had a history of myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and 
atrial fibrillation at study entry. No subjects had ibrutinib dose reductions as a result of cardiac failure 
events, and all 5 (4.7%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm had ibrutinib treatment discontinuation as a 
result of cardiac failure events.  
In Study 1142, 1 subject (0.3%) reported treatment-emergent cardiac failure event of Grade 3 or 4 
severity. This cardiac failure event was serious and did not lead to a fatal outcome, dose ibrutinib 
reduction, or discontinuation of ibrutinib treatment.  
Other malignancies 
Primary Analysis 
 
Table 23. Incidence of treatment-emergent other malignancies 
 
Extended follow-up 
In Study CLL3011, the number of subjects who developed other malignancies during the entire study 
remained similar between the treatment arms with the extended follow-up, but increased from 8 
(7.5%) to 10 (9.4%) in the Ibr+Ven arm and from 10 (9.5%) to 12 (11.4%) in the Clb+Ob arm. Non-
skin cancers were reported in 7 (6.6%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 7 (6.7%) subjects in the 
Clb+Ob arm. Melanoma was reported in 2 (1.9%) subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. Non-melanoma skin 
cancer was reported in 4 (3.8%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 3 (2.9%) subjects in the Clb+Ob 
arm. One subject in the Clb+Ob arm was diagnosed with 2 new and serious secondary malignancies 
after primary analysis. Because the investigator assessed the events of MDS and MPN as very likely 
related to chlorambucil, both were considered treatment emergent. 
In Study 1142, the number of subjects who developed other malignancies during the entire study 
remained the same with extended follow-up.  
Hypertension 
In Study CLL3011, hypertension events (identified by hypertension narrow MedDRA SMQ) were 
reported for 15 (14.2%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 5 (4.8%) subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. 
Overall, Grade 3 or 4 hypertension was reported in 9 (8.5%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 2 
(1.9%) subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. Two (1.9%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm had serious 
hypertension TEAEs. No subjects had ibrutinib discontinued and no dose reductions were reported as a 
result of treatment-emergent hypertension in either treatment arm.  
In Study 1142, hypertension events were reported for 16.4% of subjects in the FD cohort + the first 
16 cycles of the MRD cohort. Grade 3 or 4 hypertension was reported in 23 (7.1%) subjects. One 
(0.3%) subject had a serious hypertension TEAE. No subjects had treatment discontinued and no dose 
reductions were reported as a result of treatment-emergent hypertension.  
Hepatoxicity including hepatic failure 
Treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade within the SOC of Hepatobiliary Disorders were 
reported in 7 (6.6%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 4 (3.8%) subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. Grade 3 
or 4 events were reported for 4 (3.8%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 1 (1.0%) subject in the 
Clb+Ob arm. One subject (1.0%) in the Clb+Ob arm had a fatal hepatic TEAE of cholestasis. 
In the FD cohort + the first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142, hepatic TEAEs were reported 
for 4.3% of subjects. Grade 3 or 4 hepatic events were observed in 1.9% of subjects. No subjects had 
a fatal hepatic TEAEs.  
Ischemic stroke 
 
Table 24. Incidence of treatment-emergent ischaemic stroke 
In Study CLL3011, treatment-emergent ischemic stroke (identified by ischemic central nervous system 
vascular conditions SMQ narrow search) was reported in 3 (2.8%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and no 
subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. By PT, 2 (1.9%) subjects had ischemic stroke and 1 (0.9%) subject had 
cerebral infarction in the Ibr+Ven arm. No subjects had ibrutinib dose reductions as a result of 
ischemic stroke events. Both events with PTs of ischemic stroke were serious; 1 ischemic stroke event 
was fatal and the other led to discontinuation of ibrutinib.  
In Study 1142, ischemic stroke was reported for 2 (0.6%) subjects in the FD cohort + the first 16 
cycles of the MRD cohort (PTs: Grade 1 or 2 carotid artery stenosis, ischemic stroke, and transient 
ischemic attack). One event (ie, ischemic stroke in 1 subject) was serious and resulted in ibrutinib 
discontinuation.  
Diarrhoea 
In Study CLL3011, treatment-emergent diarrhea was reported in 50.9% of subjects in the Ibr+Ven 
arm and 12.4% of subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. Grade 3 diarrhea was reported in 10.4% of subjects in 
the Ibr+Ven arm and 1.0% of subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. There were no Grade 4 or fatal events. 
Most subjects who experienced diarrhea only had one event (30.2% of subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm 
and 9.5% of subjects in the Clb+Ob arm). The median time to resolution or improvement of Grade 3 
event was 9.0 days in the Ibr+Ven arm and 8.0 days in the Clb+Ob arm. Treatment-emergent 
diarrhea led to ibrutinib dose reduction in 7 (6.6%) subjects and to venetoclax dose reduction in 6 
(5.7%) subjects. In the Clb+Ob arm, diarrhea led to chlorambucil dose reduction in 1 (1.0%) subject. 
In the Ibr+Ven arm, diarrhea led to ibrutinib and venetoclax dose interruption in 11 (10.4%) and 7 
(6.6%) subjects, respectively. In the Clb+Ob arm, diarrhea led to obinutuzumab dose interruption (ie, 
infusion interrupted, delayed, or skipped) in 2 (1.9%) subjects. For 3 (2.8%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven 
arm, diarrhea led to study treatment discontinuation. 
In Study 1142, diarrhea was reported for 66.6% of subjects for the FD cohort + the first 16 cycles of 
the MRD cohort, with 4.0% of subjects experiencing diarrhea of Grade 3 or 4 severity. Diarrhea led to 
ibrutinib dose reduction in 8 (2.5%) subjects, and no diarrhea events led to ibrutinib discontinuation.  
Embryofoetal toxicity 
 
No TEAEs of embryofetal toxicity were reported in Study CLL3011 or for the FD cohort + the first 16 
cycles of the MRD cohort in Study 1142.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Decreases in ANC, hemoglobin, and platelet counts 
A summary of treatment-emergent worsening of hematological abnormalities is provided in Table 13; 
iwCLL 2008 criteria were used for the CLL studies (Hallek 2008). In these guidelines, Grade 3 and 4 
decreases in hemoglobin and platelet count are defined as a reduction from baseline of ≥50% and 
≥75%, respectively. Note, platelet and hemoglobin levels must have been below normal levels for any 
grade toxicity. Grade 3 and 4 decreases in ANC are defined as ANC of ≥500 to <1000/µl and <500/µl, 
respectively. Other non-CLL studies in the Current Label Pool used the NCI-CTCAE grading.  
Table 25. Haematology events 
Lymphocytosis 
Lymphocytosis, defined as an increase in ALC ≥50% from baseline to a level of ≥5 x 109/L, was 
reported in 43.4% of subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm and 1.0% of subjects in the Clb+Ob arm in Study 
CLL3011. The onset of lymphocytosis occurred within the first month (median of 4.1 weeks in Ibr+Ven 
arm), and resolved in all but 1 subject. The median time to resolution of lymphocytosis was 8.3 weeks 
(range: 1.6 to 15.1 weeks).  
For the FD cohort + the first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort in Study 1142, lymphocytosis was reported in 
47.0% of subjects. The onset of lymphocytosis occurred within the first month (median of 4.1 weeks). 
Lymphocytosis resolved in all but 2 subjects. The median time to resolution of lymphocytosis was 8.4 
weeks (range: 0.1 to 16.3 weeks). 
Clinical chemistry 
Grade 3 or 4 changes in clinical chemistry laboratory parameters were infrequent for each safety 
population.  
 
Hepatic abnormalities 
In Study CLL3011 (Ibr+Ven and Clb+Ob arms) and Study 1142, the majority of subjects maintained 
normal serum levels (Grade 0) of ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin post-baseline. Most post-baseline 
increases in ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin were mild (Grade 1). In Study 1142, 1 subject (0.3%) met 
the requisite laboratory criteria for potential Hy’s Law based on ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, and 
bilirubin toxicities post-baseline, and none met the requisite laboratory criteria for potential Hy’s Law in 
Study CLL3011.  
Serum creatinine abnormalities 
In Study CLL3011, baseline CrCl <60 to 30 mL/min were observed in 36.2% of subjects in the Ibr+Ven 
arm and 39.0 % of subjects in the Clb+Ob arm. Five (4.8%) subjects in the Ibr+Ven and 1 (1.0%) 
subject in the Clb+Ob arm had a post-baseline worsening of CrCl to <30 mL/min. 
In the FD cohort + the first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort in Study 1142, baseline CrCl <60 to 30 
mL/min were observed in 3.2% of subjects. No subjects had a post-baseline worsening of CrCl to <30 
mL/min. 
Uric acid 
In Study CLL3011, the proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent worsening in serum uric acid 
level was higher in the Ibr+Ven arm (34.9%) compared with the Clb+Ob arm (16.2%), however, was 
consistent with the Current Label Pool (35.4%). In Study 1142, the proportion of subjects with 
treatment-emergent worsening in serum uric acid level was 25.5%, and lower than the Current Label 
Pool. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
<65 versus ≥65 years 
 
Table 26. Summary of TEAEs by age group (≥65 vs. <65) 
In the Ibr+Ven arm for Study CLL3011, TEAEs were generally consistent between subjects aged ≥65 
years (n=90) and those aged <65 years (n=16) in the overall frequencies; however, differences 
(>10%) were observed in TEAEs of diarrhea (54.4% vs 31.3%), neutropenia (35.6% vs 25.0%), rash 
(18.9% vs 6.3%), hypertension (15.6% vs 0%), peripheral edema (13.3% vs 25.0%), cataract (1.1% 
vs 12.5%), influenza (0% vs 12.5%), and back pain (11.1% vs 0%). Differences between subjects 
aged ≥65 years and those aged <65 years were observed in Grade 3 or higher TEAEs (78.9% versus 
56.3% respectively), and drug-related TEAEs (88.9% versus 56.3%), noting the limited number of 
subjects aged <65 years. There were no meaningful (ie, >10%) differences between subjects aged 
≥65 years and those aged <65 years in the overall frequencies of TEAEs leading to ibrutinib dose 
reduction (18.9% versus 12.5%), TEAEs leading to ibrutinib discontinuation (21.1% versus 12.5%). 
TEAEs with an outcome of death occurred in 5.6% versus 12.5% of subjects <65 years and ≥65 years, 
respectively. 
In Study 1142, TEAEs were generally consistent between subjects aged ≥65 years (n=86) and those 
aged <65 years (n=237) in the overall frequencies; a difference (>10%) was observed in TEAEs of 
hypertension (23.3% vs 13.1%). There were no meaningful (>10%) differences between subjects 
aged ≥65 years and those aged <65 years in the overall frequencies of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs 
(70.9% versus 62.4% respectively), drug-related TEAEs (100% versus 93.2%), TEAEs leading to 
ibrutinib dose reduction (15.1% versus 11.0%), TEAEs leading to ibrutinib discontinuation (10.5% 
versus 4.2%), and TEAEs with an outcome of death (0 subjects versus 0.4%). 
<70 and ≥70 years 
 
Table 27. Summary of TEAEs by age group (≥70 vs. <70) 
In the Ibr+Ven arm for Study CLL3011, TEAEs were generally consistent between subjects aged ≥70 
years (n=67) and those aged <70 years (n=39) in the overall frequencies, with differences (>10%) for 
diarrhea (56.7% vs 41.0%), neutropenia (38.8% vs 25.6%), anemia (22.4% vs 10.3%), decreased 
appetite (17.9% vs 5.1%), conjunctivitis and headache (10.4% vs 0% each), respectively. Differences 
(>10%) between subjects aged ≥70 years and those aged <70 years were observed in Grade 3 or 
higher TEAEs (88.1% versus 53.8%), serious TEAEs (58.2% versus 25.6%), drug-related TEAEs 
(89.6% versus 74.4%), and TEAEs leading to ibrutinib discontinuation (26.9% versus 7.7%), 
respectively. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed more frequently in the ≥70 years subgroup 
(34.3%) versus the <70 years subgroup (17.9%). There were no meaningful differences (>10%) 
between subjects aged ≥70 years and those aged <70 years in the overall frequencies of TEAEs 
leading to ibrutinib dose reduction (17.9% versus 17.9%), and TEAEs with an outcome of death (7.5% 
versus 5.1%), respectively. 
Limited information is available for subjects ≥70 years of age in Study 1142 (n=3). 
<75 versus ≥75 years 
 
Table 28. Summary of TEAEs by age group (≥75 vs. <75) 
In the Ibr+Ven arm for Study CLL3011, TEAEs were generally consistent between subjects aged ≥75 
years (n=35) and those aged <75 years (n=71) in the overall frequencies, with >10% differences for 
diarrhea (68.6% vs 42.3%), pneumonia (20.0% vs 5.6%), bronchitis (14.3% vs 4.2%), anemia 
(31.4% vs 11.3%), decreased appetite (20.0% vs 9.9%), fatigue (25.7% vs 9.9%), peripheral edema 
(22.9% vs 11.3%), vomiting (22.9% vs 9.9%), limb injury (11.4% vs 0%), and weight decrease 
(20.0% vs 1.4%), respectively. Differences between subjects aged ≥75 years and those aged <75 
years were observed in Grade 3 or higher TEAEs (94.3% versus 66.2%), serious TEAEs (71.4% versus 
33.8%), drug-related TEAEs (97.1% versus 77.5%), TEAEs leading to ibrutinib discontinuation (37.1% 
versus 11.3%), and TEAEs leading to ibrutinib dose reduction (28.6% versus 12.7%), respectively. 
TEAEs with an outcome of death occurred in 8.6% of subjects aged ≥75 years and 5.6% of subjects 
aged <75 years. 
No subjects ≥75 years were enrolled in Study 1142. 
Sex 
No consistent differences in the TEAE profile for Ibr+Ven between the male and female subgroups 
were apparent across Study CLL3011, Study 1142, or the Current Label Pool.  
Baseline creatinine clearance 
The TEAE profile for Ibr+Ven was examined as a function of baseline CrCl (≥60, <60 to 30, and <30 
mL/min). The discussion of the ibrutinib safety profile as a function of baseline CrCl focuses on the first 
2 subgroups as no subject in Study CLL3011 or Study 1142, and only 7 subjects in the Current Label 
Pool, had a baseline CrCl of <30 mL/min. No clear and consistent trends in the TEAE profile for 
ibrutinib as a function of baseline CrCl (≥60, ≥30 to <60 mL/min) were apparent across in Study 
CLL3011, Study 1142, or the Current Label Pool. 
Baseline hepatic function 
The TEAE profile for Ibr+Ven was examined as a function of baseline hepatic function (normal, not 
normal based on NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group’s liver function classification).  
Fifteen subjects (14%) in the Ibr+Ven treatment arm of Study CLL3011 had a baseline assessment of 
not normal (hereafter abnormal) hepatic function. Differences in this treatment arm (>10%) between 
 
subjects with normal versus abnormal baseline hepatic function were observed in the overall 
frequencies of drug-related TEAEs (86.8% versus 66.7%). Among the common (≥5% overall 
incidence) Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs reported in the Ibr+Ven arm, a difference (≥5%) for subjects with 
normal versus abnormal baseline hepatic function, respectively, was observed for thrombocytopenia 
(4.4% vs 13.3%), diarrhea (12.1% vs 0%), neutrophil count decreased (9.9% vs 0%), atrial 
fibrillation (7.7% vs 0%), hyponatremia (6.6% vs 0%), and pneumonia (5.5% vs 0%). 
Thirty-seven subjects (11%) in the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142 had a 
baseline assessment of abnormal hepatic function. Differences in this treatment arm (>10%) between 
subjects with normal versus abnormal baseline hepatic function were observed in the overall 
frequencies of TEAEs leading to dose reduction (10.8% versus 21.6%). Among the common (≥5% 
overall incidence) Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs reported in the Ibr+Ven arm, a difference (≥5%) for subjects 
with normal versus abnormal baseline hepatic function, respectively, was observed for neutrophil count 
decreased (2.8% vs 8.1%).  
Geographic region 
For Study CLL3011, the majority of subjects were enrolled in EU (91.5%). No discernible differences in 
TEAEs for subjects enrolled in NA (8.5%) were observed, although fewer reported serious TEAEs in NA 
(2 of 9 subjects; 22.2%) than those in EU (47 of 97 subjects; 48.5%). 
For Study 1142 (45.5% of subjects were in NA, 24.1% in EU, and 30.3% in ROW), differences (>10%) 
were observed across geographic subgroups in the overall incidence of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs (NA: 
72.1%, EU: 64.1%, ROW: 54.1%), serious TEAEs (NA: 19.0%, EU: 12.8%, ROW: 32.7%) and TEAEs 
leading to ibrutinib dose reduction (NA: 16.3%, EU: 5.1%, ROW: 11.2%). Regional differences in 
common Grade ≥3 TEAEs (≥10% overall incidence) were noted for hypertension (NA: 12.2%, EU: 
2.6%, ROW: 2.0%). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In Study CLL3011, the overall incidence of TEAEs of any grade for subjects treated with Ibr+Ven was 
similar between subgroups (yes, no) for both moderate/strong and strong CYP3A inhibitors.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
Table 29. Overview of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation of ibrutinib (table abbreviated by the 
assessor) 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation over the total treatment period, study CLL3011 (table 
abbreviated) 
 
In the Ibr+Ven arm of Study CLL3011, 21 subjects (19.8%) had a TEAE that resulted in 
discontinuation of ibrutinib. The following TEAE preferred terms led to ibrutinib discontinuation in >1% 
of subjects in this treatment arm: cardiac failure (4.7%), diarrhea (2.8%), atrial fibrillation (1.9%), 
pneumonia (1.9%), sudden death (1.9%), and ischemic stroke (1.9%).  
In the FD cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort of Study 1142, 19 subjects (5.9%) had a TEAE 
that resulted in discontinuation of ibrutinib. No individual PTs resulted in ibrutinib discontinuation for 
>1% of subjects.  
Adverse events leading to dose reduction 
Table 30. Overview of TEAEs leading to ibrutinib dose reduction (table abbreviated by the assessor) 
TEAEs leading to dose reductions over the total treatment period, study CLL3011 (table abbreviated) 
In Study CLL3011, TEAEs of any grade leading to an ibrutinib dose reduction were reported for 17.9% 
of subjects in the Ibr+Ven arm. Diarrhea (6.6%) and neutropenia (2.8%) were the only individual 
TEAEs that led to a reduction in the dose of ibrutinib in 2% or more of subjects.  
In Study 1142, overall incidence of TEAEs leading to ibrutinib dose reduction was 12.1% for the FD 
cohort + first 16 cycles of the MRD cohort. Diarrhea (2.5%) was the only individual TEAEs that led to a 
reduction in the dose of ibrutinib in 2% or more of subjects.  
Adverse Drug Reactions 
The specific methodology for determination and assessment of ADRs was performed based on 
integration of data from Study CLL3011 with that from other RCT studies forming the basis of the ADR 
information in the currently approved SmPC.  
ADRs for the Overall Label Pool in CLL, WM, and MCL, updated to include new information from Study 
CLL3011 and Study 1142, are listed in Table 8 by SOC and frequency grouping. Frequencies are 
defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), 
rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the 
 
 
 
available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness. 
Important differences versus the adverse reaction table in the currently approved SmPC include: 
•  Dyspepsia has been added as a new ADR within the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC 
Dyspepsia (any grade): 10.3% incidence for ibrutinib versus 3.6% for comparator (ie, ≥10% 
of subjects in the pooled RCT ibrutinib group and reported at a ≥5% higher incidence 
compared to the pooled RCT comparator group) 
•  Within the Nervous system disorders SOC, the frequency category for ischemic stroke was 
changed from “Rare” to “Uncommon” 
•  Within the Cardiac disorders SOC, the frequency category for ventricular tachyarrhythmia was 
changed from “Common” to “Uncommon” 
•  Within the Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC, the frequency category for Stevens- 
Johnson syndrome was changed from “Not known” to “Rare” 
• 
Tumor lysis syndrome within the Metabolism disorders SOC is now a grouped term using a 
narrow TLS SMQ. 
Post marketing experience 
The Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) for ibrutinib has been submitted in the EU and 
includes data by the MAH from worldwide sources for the reporting period from 13 November 2019 
through 12 November 2020. The next PBRER will cover the annual period of 13 November 2020 
through 12 November 2021 and will be submitted in January 2022. Based on the cumulative total of 
39,723,797.3 grams of ibrutinib distributed (cumulative from international birth date of 13 November 
2013 through 31 October 2020), the estimated cumulative exposure to ibrutinib in marketed use is 
252,101 person-years.  
Since the database lock of the last PBRER, the SmPC was updated to include cardiac failure in the 
Special warnings and precautions for use section (Section 4.4) within the paragraph on Cardiac 
arrhythmias with recommendation to monitor cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure at baseline in 
addition to the existing language for the periodic monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data in support of this application to extend the existing indication in first line CLL with 
combination therapy with ibrutinib and venetoclax is based on 2 studies. The main study, study 
CLL3011, was a phase 3, randomized, open-label study of Ibr+Ven (N=106) versus Clb+Ob (N=105) 
in subjects with treatment-naïve CLL/SLL. Supportive safety data were derived from study 1142, a 
phase 2 study assessing Ibr+Ven in subjects with treatment-naïve CLL/SLL in a fixed duration 
treatment cohort (FD cohort; N=159) and the pre-randomization phase of the MRD-guided treatment 
discontinuation cohort (MRD cohort; N=164), the latter with an additional cycle of Ibr+Ven (Cycle 16).  
The treatment regimen in the Ibr+Ven arm in both studies consisted of 3 cycles of ibrutinib 
monotherapy, followed by 12 cycles of ibrutinib in combination with venetoclax; except for the 
treatment duration, posology for ibrutinib and venetoclax was according to the SmPC for both 
products. Treatment in the Clb+Ob arm consisted of 6 cycles.  
Patient exposure 
At the time of the primary analysis data cut-off (Study CLL3011: 26 February 2021; Study 1142: 12 
November 2020), none of the patients in either study was still on treatment. In study CLL3011, 
median treatment duration was 2.7 times longer in the Ibr+Ven arm (13.8 months) vs. the Clb+Ob 
arm (5.1 months), reflecting the fixed duration of treatment in both arms. Median treatment duration 
in the Ibr+Ven cohort in study 1142 was 14.1 months. Median relative dose intensity for ibrutinib 
treatment in the Ibr+Ven cohorts was 97.7% and 98.8% in study CLL3011 and 1142, respectively. 
Median relative dose intensity for venetoclax was 97.6% in study CLL3011 and 99.4% and 99.3% in 
the FD and MRD cohort, respectively, in study 1142. Also, median dose intensity based on the 
cumulative total dose received/planned was high (98.4%).  
The combined treatment of ibrutinib and venetoclax led to higher steady state venetoclax exposure 
based on plasma trough levels in comparison with historical control data. Assessment of the impact of 
the higher exposure levels of venetoclax on its safety profile as a single component is seriously 
hampered by a) the design of both studies (2 different combination therapies in both treatment arms 
for study CLL3011; single arm design for both the FD cohort and the pre-randomisation phase of the 
MRD cohort in study 1142) and b) the impact of combination therapy with ibrutinib, with partially 
overlapping toxicities. Overall, the safety profile of ibrutinib in combination with venetoclax is generally 
in line with the established safety profile of venetoclax in the CLL indication.  
Demographics 
Patient characteristics were balanced in both arms of study CLL3011. In the Ibr+Ven arm in study 
CLL3011, median age was 71 years (range 47-93 years) with 84.9% of patients ≥65 years of age; 
54.7% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 1 and 12.3% with ECOG 2. In study 1142, 
median age was 59 years (range 28-71 years) with 26.6% of patients ≥65 years of age; 66.6% had 
ECOG 0; no patients with ECOG 2 were included in the study. Generally, the patient population in the 
Ibr+Ven arms enrolled in studies CLL3011 and 1142 differed in terms of age and ECOG performance 
status with patients in study CLL3011 being older and with a worse ECOG performance status 
compared with those in study 1142.  
Patient disposition 
At the time of the primary analysis data cut-off (Study CLL3011: 26 February 2021; Study 1142: 12 
November 2020), none of the patients in either study was still on treatment. In study CLL3011, more 
patients discontinued treatment in the Ibr+Ven arm (22.6%) compared with the Clb+Ob arm (4.8%). 
The main differences in reasons for discontinuation of treatment concerned AEs (Ibr+Ven vs. Clb+Ob: 
10.4% vs. 1.9%) and deaths (Ibr+Ven vs. Clb+Ob: 3.8% vs. 0). Compared with the Ibr+Ven arm in 
study CLL3011, treatment discontinuation in study 1142 was lower (8.0%); treatment discontinuation 
due to AEs was 5.3% and discontinuation due to death 0.3%, likely reflecting a younger and more fit 
patient population.  
TEAEs 
In study CLL3011, the frequency of patients with any TEAE (Ibr+Ven vs. Clb+Ob: 99.1% vs. 94.3%) 
and any grade ≥3 TEAE (Ibr+Ven vs. Clb+Ob: 75.5% vs. 69.5%) was similar between treatment 
arms. Higher frequencies (Ibr+Ven vs. Clb+Ob) were noted for SAEs (46.2% vs. 27.6%; grade ≥3: 
38.7% vs. 21.9%) and fatal TEAEs leading to death within 30 days of last dose (6.6% vs. 0). In study 
1142, lower frequencies were noted for grade ≥3 TEAE (64.7%), SAEs (21.7%; grade ≥3: 18.3%) and 
fatal TEAEs (0.3%) compared with the Ibr+Ven arm of study CLL3011. Data on treatment 
discontinuations are discussed below. Interpretation of the summary of AEs in study CLL3011 is 
hampered by the difference in treatment duration between both arms. Comparison of the safety profile 
in study CLL3011 between study arms over the first 6 treatment cycles, corresponding to the fixed 
treatment duration in the control arm, showed primarily a higher frequency of SAEs with Ibr+Ven 
(34.0%; grade ≥3 SAEs 26.4%) compared with Clb+Ob (25.7%; grade ≥3 SAEs 21.0%). SAEs 
persisted at a similar frequency during both 3-month intervals for Ibr+Ven, while decreasing in 
frequency after the first 3-month treatment period for Clb+Ob. The addition of venetoclax to the 
Ibr+Ven treatment regimen indicated an increase in severe TEAEs compared with lead-in ibrutinib 
treatment (cycles 1-3 vs. cycles 4-6: 35.8% vs. 48.0%). The AE pattern over time during the first 6 
months of treatment in study CLL3011 differed between both study arms, with incidence rates for any 
TEAE, SAEs and grade ≥3 SAEs persisting at a similar frequency with Ibr+Ven, while decreasing with 
Clb+Ob.  
The most common TEAEs (≥20% of patients) in the Ibr+Ven arms were diarrhoea, neutropenia and 
nausea (reported in both studies); in study 1142, also arthralgia, headache, upper respiratory tract 
infection, fatigue, muscle spasms, increased tendency to bruise, and vomiting were reported in ≥20% 
of patients. The reported common TEAEs in the Ibr+Ven arms in both studies were generally 
consistent with the known safety profile for ibrutinib and/or venetoclax.  
In study CLL3011, grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were reported at similar frequency (Ibr+Ven vs. Clb+Ob: 68.9% 
vs. 67.6%). The most common grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (≥5% of patients) in the Ibr+Ven arm for study 
CLL3011 were neutropenia, diarrhoea, neutrophil count decreased, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, 
pneumonia, hyponatremia and thrombocytopenia. In study 1142, grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (64.4%) were 
reported at a similar frequency as in the Ibr+Ven arm of study CLL3011. The most common grade 3 or 
4 TEAEs were neutropenia (34.1%), and hypertension (6.8%).  
Compared with the Clb+Ob arm, a higher frequency in grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (>5% difference) in the 
Ibr+Ven arm was noted for diarrhoea (10.4% vs. 1.0%), hyponatraemia (5.7% vs. 0%), hypertension 
(7.5% vs. 1.9%) and atrial fibrillation (6.6% vs. 0%). A lower frequency in grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (>5% 
difference) in the Ibr+Ven arm vs. the Clb+Ob arm was noted for neutropenia (28.3% vs. 44.8%), 
thrombocytopenia (5.7% vs. 20.0%) and tumour lysis syndrome (0% vs. 5.7%).  
Dyspepsia is identified as a new ADR based on a higher frequency with Ibr+Ven (9.4%) compared with 
Clb+Ob (2.9%) in study CLL3011 as well as a higher frequency with ibrutinib in pooled safety data.  
SAEs 
In study CLL3011, the frequency of SAEs was higher in the Ibr+Ven arm (46.2%) compared with the 
Clb+Ob arm (27.6%). The difference in incidence of SAEs was less pronounced over the first 6 months 
of treatment (34.0% vs. 26.7%).  
The most common SAEs (≥2% of subjects) in the Ibr+Ven arm were atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, 
anaemia, cardiac failure and diarrhoea. The most common SAEs in the Clb+Ob arm were pneumonia, 
febrile neutropenia, infusion-related reaction and TLS. During the first 6 cycles of study CLL3011, the 
most common SAEs reported in both study arms (pneumonia, anaemia and diarrhoea) did not show a 
difference in incidence rate between study arms or a difference in trend over time. For atrial fibrillation 
SAEs reported with Ibr+Ven, incidence rates remained stable over time during the first 6 cycles. 
SAEs in the Ibr+Ven arm in study 1142 were generally reported at a lower frequency compared with 
study CLL3011.  
Deaths due to TEAEs 
In study CLL3011, fatal TEAEs (death within 30 days of last dose) were reported for 7 patients (6.6%) 
in the Ibr+Ven arm vs. no patients in the Clb+Ob arm. Of the 7 deaths in the Ibr+Ven arm, 4 deaths 
occurred during ibrutinib lead-in therapy and 3 during ibrutinib and venetoclax combination therapy.  
PTs were as follows: pneumonia, malignant neoplasm and cardiac arrest (1 patient each) and 1 patient 
with cardiac failure, pneumonia and sinus node dysfunction during ibrutinib lead-in; 1 case of 
ischaemic stroke and 2 cases of sudden death during ibrutinib + venetoclax treatment. In both cases 
of sudden death reported during Ibr+Ven treatment, the data is not sufficient to assess if venetoclax 
might indirectly contribute to the fatal cardiac events. 
In 4 of the 7 cases, the fatal events were cardiac in nature and assessed as possibly related to 
ibrutinib. Baseline factors in these 4 cases were as follows: age 63-80 years, CIRS score of 5-13, 
ECOG PS of 1 or 2 and cardiac risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, atrial fibrillation, 
myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction and diabetes mellitus).  
In study 1142, sudden death was reported in 1 patient (0.3%) during ibrutinib lead-in. The cause of 
sudden death was due to cardiomegaly and coronary artery disease as per the autopsy report. 
Causality was assessed as possibly related to ibrutinib. This patient had baseline risk factors 
(hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and congenital heart disease (atrioventricular malformation)); ECOG 
performance status was 0.  
In the cases of cardiac death, baseline factors were consistent with the baseline cardiac risk factors 
reasonably predicting severe, including fatal, cardiac events based on the results of predictive analyses 
based on logistic regression models. Based on these analyses, older age, male sex and ECOG PS of 2, 
in combination with baseline cardiac risk factors, were found to be reasonably predictive for fatal 
cardiac events. The risk minimisation measures on cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure in the SmPC 
do not fully capture the patient population at risk for cardiac death; sections 4.4 and 4.8 are updated.  
AEs of clinical interest and other safety observations 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
In study CLL3011, tumour lysis syndrome TEAEs were reported in the Clb+Ob arm only (5.7%; all 
grade 3 or 4). In study 1142, 1 patient (0.3%) reported grade 3 or 4 TLS. In the Ibr+Ven arm in study 
CLL3011, 55.7% of patients were hospitalised for TLS prophylaxis after ibrutinib lead-in. Based on 
laboratory data, 4 patients met the Howard criteria for subclinical TLS.  
TLS is an identified risk for both ibrutinib and venetoclax. Apart from the prophylactic measures to 
minimise the risk of TLS with venetoclax as described in the SmPC, a 3-cycle lead-in treatment with 
ibrutinib was introduced to reduce the risk of TLS based on high tumour burden before starting 
venetoclax treatment. The reporting of 1 case of TLS across the Ibr+Ven arms in both studies is 
considered as indirectly supporting the effectiveness of ibrutinib lead-in treatment to minimise the risk 
of TLS with combination therapy.  
Cardiac arrhythmias 
In study CLL3011, atrial fibrillation was reported more commonly in the Ibr+Ven arm (14.2%; grade 
3-4: 6.6%) compared with the Clb+Ob arm (1.9%; grade 3-4: 0%). SAEs were reported in 6.6% of 
patients in the Ibr+Ven arm. Atrial fibrillation with Ibr+Ven was more commonly reported in study 
CLL3011 compared with study 1142 (5.9%; grade 3-4: 1.5%).  
Ventricular tachyarrhythmia events were reported in 0.9% (grade 3-4: 0.6%) of patients in the 
Ibr+Ven cohort of study 1142.  
In study CLL3011, cardiac arrhythmias, excluding atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, 
were reported at similar frequency in the Ibr+Ven arm (14.2%; grade 3-4: 2.8%) compared with the 
Clb+Ob arm (10.5%; grade 3-4: 1.9%). At PT level, palpitations was the most commonly reported 
cardiac arrhythmia in either study arm. Incidences of cardiac arrhythmias in study 1142 were generally 
consistent with those in the Ibr+Ven arm of study CLL3011. Fatal cardiac arrhythmias in the Ibr+Ven 
arms were reported in 4 patients (3.8%) in study CLL3011 and in 1 patient (0.3%) in study 1142. No 
fatal cardiac arrhythmias were reported in the Clb+Ob arm.  
Cardiac failure events in study CLL3011 were reported in 5 patients (4.7%) in the Ibr+Ven arm vs. 1 
patient (1.0%) in the Clb+Ob arm. Fatal cardiac failure was reported in 1 patient in the Ibr+Ven arm 
of study CLL3011.  
It should be noted that a type II variation into the assessment of sudden death and cardiac death with 
ibrutinib is currently ongoing. The cases of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure reported in the 
Ibr+Ven arms of studies CLL3011 and 1142 are consistent with the known safety profile of ibrutinib in 
terms of cardiotoxicity.  
Ischaemic stroke 
Ischaemic stroke was reported in the Ibr+Ven arms only (2.8% and 0.6% in studies CLL3011 and 
1142, respectively). One event of fatal ischaemic stroke was reported in the Ibr+Ven arm of study 
CLL3011. The remaining events were grade 1 or 2.  
Ischaemic stroke is an identified risk for ibrutinib; the reported events were consistent with the known 
safety profile of ibrutinib.  
Other malignancies 
The frequency of other malignancies was similar across both Ibr+Ven arms and the Clb+Ob arm. No 
trends or clustering was noted for the individual PTs.  
With regard to the other AEs of special interest (haemorrhage, including major haemorrhage; 
hepatotoxicity, including hepatic failure; hypertension; infections, including viral reactivation) no new 
concerns were identified. The TEAEs reported for these safety topics were generally consistent with the 
established safety profiles for ibrutinib and/or venetoclax.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Ibr+Ven arms of studies CLL3011 and 1142, 21 patients (19.8%) and 19 patients (5.9%) 
discontinued ibrutinib treatment.  
Over the total treatment period, treatment discontinuations for either study drug were reported at a 
higher rate in the Ibr+Ven arm (20.8%) compared with the Clb+Ob arm (7.6%). TEAEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation were reported in 12.3% of patients for ibrutinib only, in 3.8% for venetoclax 
only and in 8.5% for both Ibr+Ven. Over the first 6 cycles, treatment discontinuations for either study 
drug was slightly higher for Ibr+Ven (12.3%) compared with Clb+Ob (7.6%). Treatment 
discontinuation rate across cycles 1-3 vs. cycles 4-6 was similar for the Ibr+Ven arm (6.6% vs. 6.1%) 
and decreased slightly in the Clb+Ob arm (5.7% vs. 2.0%). In study 1142, treatment discontinuations 
for either study drug were reported in 6.5% of patients over the total treatment period, with 3.7% 
discontinuing ibrutinib only, 0.6% venetoclax only and 2.2% both Ibr+Ven.  
Dose reductions 
In the Ibr+Ven arms of studies CLL3011 and 1142, dose reductions for ibrutinib were reported in 19 
patients (17.9%) and 39 patients (12.1%), respectively.  Over the total treatment period, treatment 
discontinuations for either study drug were reported at a higher rate in the Ibr+Ven arm (20.8%) 
compared with the Clb+Ob arm (7.6%). Over the first 6 cycles, treatment discontinuations for either 
study drug was slightly higher for Ibr+Ven (12.3%) compared with Clb+Ob (7.6%). Treatment 
discontinuation rate across cycles 1-3 vs. cycles 4-6 was similar for the Ibr+Ven arm (6.6% vs. 6.1%) 
and decreased slightly in the Clb+Ob arm (5.7% vs. 2.0%).  
The first-line treatment of CLL patients with ibrutinib in combination with venetoclax in study CLL3011 
indicates a more pronounced toxicity profile in terms of higher incidence rates of SAEs and fatal TEAEs 
in comparison with chlorambucil and obinutuzumab treatment. The TEAEs reported with 
ibrutinib/venetoclax combination treatment were generally consistent with the known safety profile for 
either ibrutinib or venetoclax.  
Comparison of the general safety profile for the ibrutinib/venetoclax arms across studies CLL3011 and 
1142, indicated a similar incidence rate for grade 3 or 4 TEAEs and lower incidence rates for SAEs and 
fatal TEAEs in study 1142, possibly reflecting a younger and more fit patient population.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of ibrutinib in combination with venetoclax in the first line treatment of CLL is largely 
consistent with the known safety profiles of ibrutinib and venetoclax. An update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 
related to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure is implemented in order to fully capture the patient 
population at risk for cardiac death.  
Based on the safety data for study CLL3011 as well as pooled safety data, dyspepsia is identified as a 
new ADR.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated.   The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Disease or condition 
IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab or venetoclax is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL) (see section 5.1). 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
This application provides data for a new oral fixed duration (FD) combination of ibrutinib, a BCR 
inhibitor, and venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor. An oral time-limited therapy associated with an acceptable 
safety profile and effective in a broad spectrum of patients including those with high-risk disease fulfils 
an unmet medical need, but only if supported by data proving at least no detriment on time to next 
treatment and overall survival; eventually essentially all patients will require new treatment. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
Based on promising preclinical and early clinical data a cohort with FD ibrutinib + venetoclax (ibr+ven) 
was added through an amendment to the ongoing 1142 single-arm study - the randomized 3011 
study. In the randomized 3011 study, this means that a SOC treatment (clb+obi; see below) of ~6 
months duration is compared to an experimental regimen of ~14 months duration. 
Study 3011 
This was an open study randomizing previously untreated subjects older than 64 years or with 
comorbidities, excluding those with del17p/TP53 mutated disease, 1:1 between the experimental 
regimen and the approved chlorambucil + obinutuzumab (clb+olb) regimen. Stratification factors were 
IGHV and del11q status. The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by IRC, stratified test, with the 
following secondary endpoints tested hierarchically in the given order: MRD negativity rate in bone 
marrow by NGS, defined as the proportion of subjects who reached MRD negative disease status (<1 
 
CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes) on or prior to initiation of subsequent anti-leukemic therapy; CR; ORR; 
OS; rate of sustained platelet improvement; rate of sustained hemoglobin improvement; time to 
improvement in FACIT fatigue score. Ibrutinib was administrated for a total of 15 cycles (15x28=420 
days, corresponding to approximately 14 months) and venetoclax was introduced after 3 cycles of 
ibrutinib monotherapy as an attempt to reduce frequency/severity of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), 
and continued for 12 cycles. 
The ITT analysis set consisted of 211 subjects, 106 in the experimental arm and 105 in the control 
arm. The primary analysis was event-driven, planned after 71 observed events, and based on a cut-off 
on 26 February 2021 with a median follow-up of ~28 months. An analysis with extended follow-up was 
also provided, cut-off 19 August 2021 with a median follow-up of ~34 months. With the response to 
the RSI, updates on OS, PFS, and DOR based on a 17 January 2022 cut-off were provided, covering a 
median time on study of 38.9 months. 
Study 1142, FD cohort 
This was a single-arm trial enrolling previously untreated subjects 18-70 years old with or without 
del17p/TP53 mutation, i.e., a more fit population compared to that enrolled in the 3011 study. The 
sample size/power calculation was based on assumptions in the non-del17p population and accordingly 
at least 125 subjects without this genetic aberration were to be recruited. The primary endpoint was 
CRR (CR/CRi) per investigator in the non-del17p population, testing ≤37% vs >37%.  
The analysis set used for the primary analysis consisted of 159 subjects whereof 27 with del17p/TP53 
mutation. The primary analysis was planned when the last enrolled subject had the opportunity to be 
followed for at least 30 cycles (15 cycles of treatment + 15 cycles of posttreatment follow-up) and 
based on a data extract on 12 November 2020, with a median follow-up of ~28 months. An analysis 
with extended follow-up was also provided, cut-off 4 August 2021 with a median follow-up of ~39 
months. With the response to the RSI, an analysis based on a 07 March 2022 cut-off was provided, 
covering a median time on study of 44.3 months. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study 3011 
The experimental regimen was statistically superior over control in terms of PFS, HR=0.216 (95% 
CI: 0.131, 0.357); p<0.0001, at the primary analysis by IRC, with an event rate of 64% for the control 
arm. This is supported by presented alternative analyses, and a generally consistent treatment effect 
across predefined subgroups. By an additional follow-up of 6 months, the outcome remains stable. 
With the response to the RSI, an analysis with a median of 39 months on study was provided, showing 
a HR of 0.188 (0.116, 0.307).  
With sample rates of 87% in the experimental arm and 80% in the control arm, the primary analysis of 
best MRD response in bone marrow (BM) assessed by NGS showed a response rate of 55.7% in the 
experimental arm and 21.0% in the control arm, rate ratio 2.65 (95% CI: 1.75, 3.99); p<0.0001.  
At 3 months post-treatment, the MRD negativity rates in the experimental arm vs the control arm were 
52% vs 17% in BM (sample rates 80% vs 77%) and 55% vs 39% in peripheral blood (PB) (sample 
rates 83% vs 84%), respectively. At 12 months post treatment, corresponding to 26 months after 
randomisation, and with a sampling rate of 77%, the MRD negativity rate in PB was 49% in the 
experimental arm, therefore significantly more subjects in the experimental arm reached MRD 
negativity in BM than subjects in the control arm.   
With extended follow up, the 30-month landmark estimate for IRC-assessed DOR was 86.7% in the 
experimental arm and 35.5% in the control arm. With ~34 months median follow-up for the 3011 
study (6 additional months compared to the inferential analysis): stable PFS (event rate 65% in the 
control arm, 20% in the experimental arm) with a 24-month landmark of 85% for the experimental 
arm vs 46% in the control arm, MRD negativity rate of 49% in PB in the experimental arm at 26 
months after randomisation (reasonably stable compared to 3 months post-treatment, 55%), the 18-
month landmark estimate for duration of IRC-assessed CRR was 98% in the experimental arm and 
85% in the control arm, the 30-month landmark estimate for IRC-assessed DOR was 87% in the 
experimental arm and 36% in the control arm, and the HR point estimate for time to next treatment 
was 0.147. 
At the 17 January 2022 cut-off and an event rate of 70% in the control arm and 21% in the 
experimental arm, the HR for PFS was 0.188 (95% CI: 0.116, 0.307). The median DOR was still not 
reached in the experimental arm and was 21.6 months in the control arm. The 30-month DOR rates 
were 86.5% in the experimental arm and 39.1% in the control arm.  
Regarding OS, at the primary analysis, 11 (10.4%) death events were observed in the experimental 
arm and 12 (11.4%) in the control arm; HR=1.048 (95% CI: 0.454, 2.419). Based on the data cut-off 
of 17 January 2022 with a median time on study of 39 months and a maturity of 21% in the control 
arm and 11% in the experimental arm, the HR for OS was estimated at 0.582 (95% CI: 0.286, 1.187). 
Thus, with 5 months further follow-up after the August 2021 cut-off, no longer-term detrimental effect 
on OS is noted.  
Regarding time to next treatment, at the primary analysis, 4 subjects in the experimental arm and 27 
in the control arm had received subsequent anticancer therapy; median not reached in any arm, HR 
0.143 (95% CI: 0.050, 0.410). With extended follow-up, 6 subjects in the experimental arm and 35 in 
the control arm had received subsequent anticancer therapy; median not reached in any arm, HR 
0.147 (95% CI: 0.062, 0.350). In the experimental arm, 2/6 subjects received a BTK inhibitor. In the 
control arm, 28 and 4 subjects received a BTK inhibitor and venetoclax, respectively. 
Regarding TLS risk reduction, after 3 months lead-in treatment with ibrutinib monotherapy, baseline 
TLS risk “high” based on high tumour burden was reduced to medium or low risk in 22/26 (85%) 
subjects, and of the 69 subjects in the experimental arm that had an indication for hospitalization, 
hospitalization was no longer indicated for 24 (35%) of these subjects.   
Study 1142, FD cohort 
At the primary analysis, the CRR per investigator for all subjects was 55.3% (95% CI: 47.6, 63.1) and 
55.9% (95% CI: 47.5, 64.2) for subjects without del 17p. The CR rate for subjects without del 17p 
was significantly higher than the study-assumed minimum rate of 37% (1-sided p-value < 0.0001) as 
well as the 40% rate achieved in this population with FCR. CRR in del 17p/TP53 mutated disease 
(n=27) was similar to the complement, 56%. With extended follow-up, CRR was 58% per investigator 
and 64% per IRC in the non-del17 population. At the primary analysis and with extended follow-up, 
the durable complete response rate (1 year, corresponding to 12 cycles) in the non-del17 population 
was 48.5% and 53.7%, respectively. In del 17p/TP53 mutated disease the durable complete response 
rate was 48.1% [95% CI: 29.3, 67.0]; no changes were observed with extended follow-up.  
At the primary analysis, the ORR per investigator assessment as well as IRC was 96.2% for all subjects 
and 95.6% for subjects without del 17p. For subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated disease, the ORR was 
96.3%. No change in ORR per investigator assessment was observed after extended follow-up. 
At the primary analysis, the median DOR per investigator assessment were not reached for all subjects 
or for subjects without del 17p; the 24-month landmark estimates were 94.7% for all subjects and 
96.1% for subjects without del 17p based on an overall median follow-up of 27.9 months. 
With extended follow-up, similar outcomes in DOR were observed for all subjects and subjects without 
del 17p (median not reached for both populations; 30-month landmark estimates of 88.6% and 
89.8%, respectively). At the primary analysis, the 24-month landmark estimate for DOR was 84% for 
the del17p/TP53 population; at a median follow-up of 44 months, the 30-month landmark estimate 
was 80%. For contextualisation, the corresponding figures for the non-del17p/TP53 mutated 
population were 96% and 90%, respectively.  
With ~39 months median follow-up for the 1142 study (9 additional months compared to the 
inferential analysis): CRR of 58% per investigator and 64% per IRC in the non-del17p population, a 
durable CRR (1 year, corresponding to 12 cycles) of 54% in the non-del17p population, 30-month 
landmark estimate for DOR of 89% in the all-treated population, and a MRD negativity rate in PB 12 
months post-treatment of 43% in an analysis associated with uncertainties. CRR in del 17p/TP53 
mutated disease (n=27) was roughly similar to the complement, 56%, per investigator assessment 
and durable complete response was 48.1% [95% CI: 29.3, 67.0].  
At the primary analysis, with MRD assessed by flow cytometry in the all-treated population, the overall 
negativity rate was 60% in BM and 77% in PB, and the corresponding figures 52% and 57% for MRD 
negativity rate 3 months post-treatment. The outcomes were similar at extended follow-up. At the 
time of the planned analysis 12 months post-treatment (PB only), 39 subjects (roughly 25%) were 
non-evaluable and therefore the outcome is deemed non-robust. With extended follow-up, only 9 
subjects remained non-evaluable, and here the MRD negativity was 43% in the all-treated population. 
This outcome is, however, also subject to uncertainties as samples may have been collected at later 
time points. With that, the outcome may be conservative. The overall MRD negativity rate in PB in the 
del17p/TP53 population was 82% at the primary analysis, 59% at 3 months post-treatment, and 37% 
at 12 months post-treatment. The corresponding figures for BM were 41%, 41% and not applicable. 
For contextualisation, the corresponding figures for the non-del17p/TP53 population were: PB: 76%, 
57%, and 35%; BM: 62%, 54% and not applicable.  
Regarding OS, the K-M point estimates at 24 months were 98.1% for all subjects and 97.7% for non-
del 17p subjects. For subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated disease, the K-M point estimate at 24 
months was 96.2%. 
Time to next treatment was not analysed. At the primary analysis, 4 subjects (2.5%) had reintroduced 
ibrutinib post-PD; 5 subjects had received other therapy (mainly systemic therapy). With extended 
follow-up, an additional 5 subjects had reintroduced ibrutinib post-PD relative to the primary analysis; 
6 subjects had received other therapy (mainly systemic therapy). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
With current follow-up times, median ~39 months in the 3011 study and ~44 months in the FD cohort 
of the 1142 study, the most important uncertainties relate to persistence of treatment effect with the 
experimental regimen, not least in subjects with adverse prognostic factors such as del17p/TP53 
mutated disease. Here, also data on PFS2 would be of principal interest, especially as treatment 
regimens with different duration were compared in the randomised study. Further and robust follow-up 
is needed.  
Data on OS is currently immature which is expected in a 1st line setting in CLL and further follow-up is 
needed. Data on del17p/TP53 mutated disease is scarce with the entire dataset consisting of only 27 
subjects in the 1142 SAT. 
Further follow-up on survival and persistence of response will be submitted as post authorisation 
commitments.  
For study CLL3011, the MAH proposes yearly updates on survival and efficacy until study completion, 
2024 or after 50% of the subjects have died, whichever comes first. The first such data cut will be 
scheduled in February 2023 with the report to be provided by August 2023.  
For Study 1142, the study completion date is currently anticipated in 2023 with approximately 5 and 7 
years of follow-up for the FD and MRD cohorts, respectively. Updates based on a February 2023 cutoff 
will be provided. A final CSR will also be submitted based on the later study completion date.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Study CLL3011 
Patient characteristics were balanced in both arms of study CLL3011. In the Ibr+Ven arm in study 
CLL3011, median age was 71 years (range 47-93 years) with 84.9% of patients ≥65 years of age; 
54.7% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 1 and 12.3% with ECOG 2. The frequency of 
patients with any TEAE (Ibr+Ven vs. Clb+Ob: 99.1% vs. 94.3%) and any grade ≥3 TEAE (Ibr+Ven vs. 
Clb+Ob: 75.5% vs. 69.5%) was similar between treatment arms. Higher frequencies (Ibr+Ven vs. 
Clb+Ob) were noted for SAEs (46.2% vs. 27.6%; grade ≥3: 38.7% vs. 21.9%) and fatal TEAEs 
leading to death within 30 days of last dose (6.6% vs. 0).  
A higher frequency in grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (>5% difference) in the Ibr+Ven arm vs. the Clb+Ob arm 
was noted for diarrhoea (10.4% vs. 1.0%), hyponatraemia (5.7% vs. 0%), hypertension (7.5% vs. 
1.9%) and atrial fibrillation (6.6% vs. 0%). A lower frequency in grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (>5% difference) 
in the Ibr+Ven arm vs. the Clb+Ob arm was noted for neutropenia (28.3% vs. 44.8%), 
thrombocytopenia (5.7% vs. 20.0%) and tumour lysis syndrome (0% vs. 5.7%).  
The frequency of SAEs was higher in the Ibr+Ven arm (46.2%) compared with the Clb+Ob arm 
(27.6%). The most common SAEs (≥2% of subjects) in the Ibr+Ven arm were atrial fibrillation, 
pneumonia, anaemia, cardiac failure, and diarrhoea. The most common SAEs in the Clb+Ob arm were 
pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, infusion-related reaction, and TLS.  
Fatal TEAEs (death within 30 days of last dose) were reported for 7 patients (6.6%) in the Ibr+Ven 
arm vs. no patients in the Clb+Ob arm. Of the 7 deaths in the Ibr+Ven arm, 4 deaths occurred during 
ibrutinib lead-in therapy and 3 during ibrutinib and venetoclax combination therapy. For the deaths 
reported during ibrutinib lead-in, the following PTs were reported: pneumonia, malignant neoplasm, 
and cardiac arrest (1 patient each) and 1 patient with cardiac failure, pneumonia, and sinus node 
dysfunction. During ibrutinib + venetoclax treatment, 3 deaths were reported with the following PTs: 1 
case of ischaemic stroke and 2 cases of sudden death. In 4 of 7 patients, death was cardiac in nature 
and the fatal events were assessed as possibly related to ibrutinib. Baseline factors in these 4 cases 
were as follows: age 63-80 years, CIRS score of 5-13, ECOG PS of 1 or 2 and cardiac risk factors 
(hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, 
and diabetes mellitus).   
Tumour lysis syndrome TEAEs were reported in the Clb+Ob arm only (5.7%; all grade 3 or 4). In the 
Ibr+Ven arm in study CLL3011, 55.7% of patients were hospitalised for TLS prophylaxis after ibrutinib 
lead-in. Based on laboratory data, 4 patients met the Howard criteria for subclinical TLS.  
Dyspepsia is identified as a new ADR based on a higher frequency with Ibr+Ven (9.4%) compared with 
Clb+Ob (2.9%) in study CLL3011 as well as a higher frequency with ibrutinib in pooled safety data.  
Treatment discontinuations for either study drug were reported at a higher rate in the Ibr+Ven arm 
(20.8%) compared with the Clb+Ob arm (7.6%). TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were 
reported in 12.3% of patients for ibrutinib only, in 3.8% for venetoclax only and in 8.5% for both 
Ibr+Ven. 
Study 1142 
Median age was 59 years (range 28-71 years) with 26.6% of patients ≥65 years of age; 66.6% had 
ECOG 0; no patients with ECOG 2 were included in the study. Lower frequencies were noted for grade 
≥3 TEAE (64.7%), SAEs (21.7%; grade ≥3: 18.3%) and fatal TEAEs (0.3%) compared with the 
Ibr+Ven arm of study CLL3011. The fatal event was reported as sudden death in 1 patient (0.3%) 
during ibrutinib lead-in. The sudden death in this patient was due to cardiac related events; the patient 
had an ECOG PS of 0 and baseline cardiac risk factors. Causality was assessed as possibly related to 
ibrutinib. Grade 3 or 4 TLS was reported in 1 patient (0.3%).  
Treatment discontinuations for either study drug were reported in 6.5% of patients over the total 
treatment period, with 3.7% discontinuing ibrutinib only, 0.6% venetoclax only and 2.2% both 
Ibr+Ven 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The sample size in the CLL3011 study is relatively small. There is a trend to an increase in treatment 
associated deaths; however, uncertainty of the magnitude of any difference is large. 
The precise impact of each agent in the combination on the safety profile cannot be ascertained in the 
absence of single agent treatment arms. Given the few cases of fatal cardiac death during 
ibrutinib/venetoclax combination treatment, there is uncertainty regarding a potential indirect role of 
venetoclax. The effect of increased exposure of venetoclax on the safety profile of venetoclax when 
given in combination with ibrutinib cannot be assessed.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the randomised 3011 study, enrolling previously untreated subjects older than 64 years or with 
comorbidities, excluding those with del17p/TP53 mutated disease, the experimental regimen was 
significantly and robustly superior to clb+obi in terms of PFS, with a HR point estimate of 0.216. This 
outcome is supported by significantly higher best MRD response in BM and CRR in the experimental 
arm. With a median time on study of ~39 months, no detrimental effect on OS was noted. A high CRR 
in study 1142 of 56% was noted, independently of del17p, supported by an ORR of 96% and overall 
MRD negativity rates of 60% in BM and 77% in PB. Persistence of effect is supported by the long term 
outcomes (see section 3.4). Data investigating the ibr+ven regimen in fit patients is derived in the 
1142 SAT and compatible with a highly efficient treatment regimen in terms of activity and a high 
fraction of durable complete responses.  
From a safety perspective, the imbalance in fatal events in study CLL3011 is mainly driven by cardiac 
related deaths in 4 patients. The 4 cardiac deaths reported in the Ibr+Ven arm of study CLL3011 as 
well as the death in study 1142 were assessed as possibly related to ibrutinib and occurred in patients 
with baseline risk factors. The baseline factors identified in these patients were consistent with the 
baseline cardiac risk factors reasonably predicting severe, including fatal, cardiac events based on the 
results of predictive analyses based on logistic regression models. Based on these analyses, older age, 
male sex and ECOG PS of 2, in combination with baseline cardiac risk factors, were found to be 
reasonably predictive for fatal cardiac events. 
It is acknowledged that with further follow-up of the 3011 study (median 39 months), a HR of 0.582 
(95% CI: 0.286, 1.187) was estimated; thus, no longer-term detrimental effect on OS is noted.  
The oral, ven+ibr treatment intended for a limited treatment duration, further provides convenience 
and the possibility of a drug holiday, and will be important as one of several reasonable treatment 
options for 1L CLL patients who are sufficiently fit for its use.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In accordance with the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH  applied 
for an additional one year marketing protection period in the framework of this extension of indication. 
The request was based on the MAH’s position that Imbruvica represents a significant clinical benefit in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ibrutinib plus Venetoclax Fixed Duration Combination Treatment of Adult Patients with Previously 
Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in comparison with existing therapies. 
The CHMP accepted the argument in support of the use of all oral, ven+ibr for a limited treatment 
duration, providing the possibility of a drug holiday, is one of several reasonable treatment options for 
1L CLL patients. Further, the MAH has shown that landmark estimate 24-month PFS and OS, CR and 
MRD rates, as well as rates of hematological toxicity are at least comparable or better than available 
alternatives. It was pointed out that each of the available options have specific pro’s in form of 
convenience, and cons in terms of qualitative side effects profiles, that make different regimens best fit 
for different patients. There is no one size fits all in 1L CLL treatment. It is recognised that the side 
effect profile of ven+ibr is less favourable than some less effective treatment regimens; however, it is 
well characterised and manageable. In patients who are sufficiently fit for its use, and who wish for the 
possibility of a treatment holiday, ven+ibr would be an appropriate treatment option. It can be 
concluded that overall the B/R of time-limited ven+ibr is not worse than for available treatment 
alternatives. 
In conclusion, significant clinical benefit over available options, has been demonstrated either through 
being an all-oral option or by allowing for a treatment holiday based on a fixed duration of treatment. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of imbruvica in combination with venetoclax in the first line treatment of CLL is 
positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of the existing CLL indication to include combination treatment with venetoclax for 
previously untreated patients based on efficacy and safety data from phase 3 study GLOW and phase 
2 study CAPTIVATE; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are 
updated. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP was amended as version 19.3 in line 
with the extension of indication.   
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Imbruvica is not similar to Gazyvaro within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

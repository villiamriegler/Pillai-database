SmPC in order to update paediatric information 
based on final results from studies ITCC-059 
(WI203581) and INO-Ped-ALL-1 (WI235086). Study 
WI203581 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, European, 
multi-cohort, open-label study in pediatric patients 
(≥1 and <18 years of age) with R/R CD22-positive 
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); and study 
EMEA/H/C/004119/II/0026 and Besponsa 
EMEA/H/C/004119/P46/004. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

WI235086 is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1 
study to assess safety and tolerability of InO in 
Japanese pediatric patients with R/R CD22-positive 
ALL. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The 
MAH took also the opportunity to update the ATC 
code in section 5.1 and to implement some editorial 
changes in the PI. The RMP version 2.2 has also been 
submitted.

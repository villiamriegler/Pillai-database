SmPC and PL 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to add 
hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia to the list of 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs), with the frequency 
common, based on an updated analysis of data 
submitted during the marketing authorisation 
procedure. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH proposed to update 
hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia to the list of adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs), with the frequency common, based 
on a reanalysis of data submitted during the initial 
marketing authorisation procedure. Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC has been updated to clarify recommendations for 
dose reductions. Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC were

the current information in section 4.2 of the SmPC to 
improve clarity and provide more specific guidance. 
Section 4.4 was updated to also reflect ILD-like 
adverse reactions. The MAH also took the 
opportunity to introduce editorial changes in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
harmonized to reflect consistently ILD and ILD-like 
reactions. In addition, examples of Grade 4 skin reactions 
were removed from section 4.2 of the SmPC. Finally, in 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC, the word “paronychia” has been 
replaced by “nail toxicity”. For more information, please 
refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

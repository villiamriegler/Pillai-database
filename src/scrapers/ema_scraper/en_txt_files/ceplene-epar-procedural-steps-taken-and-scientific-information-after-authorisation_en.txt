are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

study to follow-up Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in 
patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in First 
Complete Remission (CR1) - Comparison of patients 
who receive Ceplene/Interleukin-2 as remission

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission

submitted the final study report of the Ceplene Cohort 
Study 3306. The CHMP considered that the 3306 Cohort 
study does not further contribute in a significant way to the 
understanding of the B/R of Ceplene/IL2 in the 
maintenance treatment of patients with acute myeloid 
leukaemia in first remission. However, based on the 
accumulated data so far, the overall benefit/risk balance of 
Ceplene in the approved indication remains unchanged. 
Based on the poor uptake of Ceplene/IL 2 and in light of 
the available efficacy data generated since the granting of 
the Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP agreed to close the 
remaining specific obligation in the Annex II (SOB 002). 
Due to the rarity of the disease, the data are still not as 
comprehensive as a full marketing authorisation. The MAH 
shall therefore continue to provide yearly updates on any 
new information concerning efficacy and safety of the 
product in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in first 
complete remission concomitantly treated with interleukin-
2 (IL-2) as a condition (specific obligation) to the 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.

The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance

medicinal product, concluded that Marketing Authorisation 
of Ceplene should be varied. 
In addition, considering the outcome of the GCP inspection 
and available MRD data from study EPC2008-02, the CHMP 
considered that the specific obligation should be revised to: 
Evaluate Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) at baseline and 
follow-up in a clinical study or registry, as appropriate, for 
the assessment of the anti-leukaemic activity of Ceplene 
plus low dose Interleukin-2 in a sufficient number of adult 
patients stratified by age greater or less than 60 years with 
Acute Myeloid Leukemia in First Complete Remission.

infection, gastritis and abdominal distension as new 
PL 
of remission maintenance therapy with Ceplene in 
adverse drug reactions based on safety data from 
study EPC2008-02. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet 
and revise the labelling of the outer carton in line 
with QRD review of the specimen. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling 
and Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
conjunction with low-dose IL-2 on immune response and 
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in adult patients with AML 
in first Complete Remission (CR1), the CHMP considered 
appropriate to include leucopenia, neutropenia, upper 
respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, gastritis and 
abdominal distension as new adverse drug reactions in the 
product information of Ceplene. The benefit risk balance of 
Ceplene remains positive.

therefore recommends the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation under exceptional circumstances. The CHMP 
also recommends that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the limited number of patients exposed 
to Ceplene outside of clinical trials which precludes the 
adequate collection of pharmacovigilance data in real-world 
clinical use.

Hereditary factor X deficiency is a rare type of bleeding disorder caused by the inherited lack of 
coagulation factor X. Factor X deficiency can result in bleeding patterns similar to, if less frequent than, 
those seen in males with haemophilia A or B. Unlike haemophilia A and B, however, the gene for factor 
X is located on the long arm of chromosome 13. Therefore, both genders can be carriers and both can 
develop factor X deficiency. 
The prevalence of severe factor X deficiency in the general population is approximately 1 in 1 million, 
which puts it between one hundredth and one twentieth of the prevalence of haemophilia A and B, 
respectively. 
Factor X deficiency varies in severity, which is defined according to the endogenous level of factor X in 
the plasma. Severe factor X deficiency is defined as endogenous concentration of factor X being <1% 
(< 1 IU/dL); moderate deficiency is when the factor X level is 1-5%; and mild deficiency is when factor 
X level is >5%. The level of endogenous factor X activity in the general population has been reported 
at 65 to 120 IU/dL. 
Coagadex (Coagulation Factor X [Human]) is a human plasma-derived coagulation factor that is used 
as a replacement for the naturally existing coagulation factor X in patients with hereditary factor X 
deficiency. 
Currently Coagadex is licensed in the European Union (EU) with the following indication: 
“Coagadex is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding episodes and for perioperative 
management in patients with hereditary factor X deficiency.”  
The initial marketing authorisation was based on the results of trials Ten01 and Ten03 in 18 patients 
>12 years old with hereditary FX deficiency.  
In the EU, a post-marketing commitment to study the prophylactic use of Coagadex in a population of 
young children (<12 years of age) was agreed which resulted in study Ten02. This study has been 
confirmed as complying with the requirements of the Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) and is the 
focus of this submission. As a result of this study, there are changes to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
One of the objectives of trial Ten02 was to assess the pharmacokinetic (FX incremental recovery and 
trough levels) of FACTOR X after a single dose of 50 IU/kg. The recommended bolus doses at the Visit 
1 (Baseline) and the End of Study Visit recovery assessment visit was 50 IU/kg. This was higher than 
the bolus dose of 25 IU/kg used in the Ten01 clinical trial of FACTOR X in adults and adolescents. 
Factor X Activity Measurements (defined as FX:C levels) 
FX:C assays for incremental recovery and trough level measurements were performed by the central 
laboratory (Haematology Department, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK using the one-stage 
clotting assays) and the local laboratories at each Investigator Site. Central laboratory results were 
used in the efficacy analysis.  
The pre- and post-dose plasma samples for incremental recovery were assayed together. Local 
laboratory results were used to check an appropriate trough level was being maintained and for dose 
adjustment, if necessary. All central and local laboratory results were recorded in the CRF. FX:C assays 
were performed on a pre-dose sample if the subject has a major bleed.  
Blood samples for incremental recovery were taken at 30 minutes post-dose and were ideally drawn 
from the opposite arm to the arm in which FACTOR X was administered. However, if blood samples 
were drawn from the same site as the infusion, which includes venous access devices (e.g. Portacath), 
in these cases the line/device was flushed with saline (equivalent to 2 volumes of the dead space) and 
a volume of blood equivalent to 2 volumes of the dead space of the infusion line was withdrawn before 
obtaining the blood samples. If the sample was drawn from the same site as the infusion, this was 
documented in the CRF in case of spurious results. 
Incremental Recovery 
Visit 1 (Baseline) and End of Study Visit (V5) recovery data was available for all 9 subjects. Plasma 
concentrations were obtained for FX:C, using the one-stage clotting assay. 
The recommended bolus dose of FACTOR X was 50 IU/kg, the mean dose administered at Visit 1 
(Baseline) was 48.7 IU/kg and 50.0 IU/kg at End of Study (V5). The mean incremental recovery at 
Visit 1 (Baseline) was 1.66 IU/dL per IU/kg and 1.82 IU/dL per IU/kg after 50 exposures and 6 months 
treatment (End of Study Visit, V5). The high degree of overlap of the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
each visit indicated the appropriateness of combining data from the 2 visits, which gave an overall 
mean incremental recovery of 1.74 IU/dL per IU/kg, see Table 15a. 
 
 
 
A statistical analysis to compare IRs between the two age groups was conducted using a linear 
regression model with terms for an overall intercept and age group. The overall mean IR for the 
younger age group (0 to 5 years) was statistically lower than that observed for the older subjects: 
mean IR (IU/dL per IU/kg) of 1.53 (Table 15c) and 1.91 (Table 15b) respectively (p=0.0013). In 
addition, the minimum and maximum IR values were lower in the younger age group than the older 
age group. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The difference in the IR values between the age groups was found to be statistically significant at each 
visit, Table 15d. 
The IR for the two subjects excluded from the Per-Protocol population were slightly higher than those 
observed in the other subjects in the same age group (0 to 5 years) and that compared to the IRs 
observed when these subjects re-entered the study for their second treatment cycle (Table 16). This 
difference was not considered to be clinically significant. 
FX:C activity levels 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FX:C trough levels were measured at Screening Visit, Visit 1(Baseline) pre-bolus (V1), then 48 to 72 
hours post-infusion (V2), 9 to 28 days (V3) and 29 to 42 days (V4) after the first infusion, and after 6 
months treatment and 50 EDs (V5/End of Study, EOS).  
Table 17a displays the central laboratory FX:C values for each subject in the PP population. Two 
subjects had trough levels below 5 IU/dL (dose adjustment stage). It was assumed that subjects would 
have reached steady state by V4. Table 17b displays the doses taken by each subject in the PP group 
prior to V4 and the number of days prior to V4 the doses were administered. For all the subjects in the 
PP group the doses and dosing intervals used in the study were sufficient to maintain trough levels 
above the target level of 5 IU/dL from visit 4 onwards (steady state). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the two subjects excluded from the Per-Protocol population, FX:C levels were maintained above 5 
IU/dl throughout the study (Table 18a). Summary of doses taken prior to V4 are summarised in Table 
18b. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Factor X is one of the vitamin-K-dependent serine proteases and plays a crucial role in blood 
coagulation in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of the clotting cascade. Factor X is an inactive 
 
 
 
 
 
zymogen, which can be activated by factor IXa (via the intrinsic pathway) or by factor VIIa (via the 
extrinsic pathway). Factor X is converted from its inactive form to the active form (factor Xa) by the 
cleavage of a 52-residue peptide from the heavy chain. Factor Xa associates with factor Va on a 
phospholipid surface to form the prothrombinase complex, which activates prothrombin to thrombin in 
the presence of calcium ions. Thrombin then acts upon soluble fibrinogen and factor XIII to generate a 
cross-linked fibrin clot. The replacement of factor X in patients with hereditary deficiency aims to 
restore clinically relevant levels of FX in order to allow coagulation to occur in a timely manner. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Study Ten02 was conducted with nine children below 12 years of age and aimed at characterising 
incremental recovery at 30 minutes after a dose of 50 IU/kg BW and trough levels at least 4 time 
points during the prophylactic administration of FX over 26 weeks. 
Although all enrolled children were shown to display a genotype consistent with severe FX deficiency, 
at baseline all subjects were found to have elevated FX levels (mean 7.9 IU/dl, min 6 IU/dl, max 11 
IU/dl). These values can be explained by recent (i.e. in the prior 3-4 days) use of FX containing 
products in all subjects, most often prothrombin complex concentrate. 
In all subjects, trough levels were shown to be above the 5 IU/dl minimum defined as acceptable for 
this trial at all visits, except for one subject at V4, at which time steady state was probably not 
reached. 
Mean incremental recovery was found to be 1.74 (min 1.3, max 2.2) IU/dL per IU/kg for the overall 
group. However, values for the younger (0-5) and older (6-11) age cohort were shown to differ. The 
younger subjects had a mean IR of 1.53 (1.3, 1.8) while the older subjects had mean IR values of 1.91 
(1.6, 2.2). The difference was shown to be statistically significant. However, the impact on the formula 
used for calculation of units necessary to achieving a desired level increase using a specific value for 
each age group is considered to be minimal. In addition, introducing three different calculation 
formulas (for ≥12, 6-11, 0-5) into the SmPC is unnecessarily complex.  
Therefore it is agreed to use the average value for both younger age cohorts in the SmPC (please see 
section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Full PK profiles from adolescents and adults are available from trial Ten01. In this paediatric trial Ten 
3, the clinical pharmacology objective was to elucidate the incremental recovery and the trough levels 
in children below 12 years of age. 
The trough levels during routine prophylaxis were shown to be in a range deemed as protective by 
available literature. As with most coagulation factors, incremental recovery was demonstrated to be 
lower in the overall paediatric population of trial Ten02 than in the adolescent and adult population of 
trial Ten01. The recommendations as given in section 4.2 of the SmPC are considered adequate.

Ten02 
A phase III open-label multicentre study to confirm the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of 
Coagadex in the prophylaxis of bleeding in factor X deficient children under the age of 12 years 
Methods 
Study participants 
Inclusion Criteria 
All of the criteria below had to be met for a subject to be eligible: 
1. Subjects who had hereditary severe or moderate FX deficiency (FX:C <5 IU/dL, based on their 
lowest reliable FX:C recorded). 
2. Subjects under 12 years old, whose parent/guardian gave written informed consent. 
3. Subjects who had a history of severe bleeding (a minimum of one bleed with a bleed score of 3 or 4, 
Appendix VI of the study protocol) or a mutation in the F10 gene causing a documented severe 
bleeding phenotype. 
Exclusion Criteria 
The presence of any of the following criteria would make a subject ineligible: 
1. Subjects who had a history or suspicion of inhibitor development to FX. 
2. Subjects who had thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 x 109/L). 
3. Subjects who had clinically significant renal disease (serum creatinine >200µmol/L). 
4. Subjects who had clinically significant liver disease (serum ALT levels greater than three times the 
upper normal limit). 
5. Subjects were known to have other coagulopathy or thrombophilia. 
6. Subjects who had known or suspected hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product or its 
excipients. 
7. Subjects who had a history of unreliability or non-cooperation. 
8. Subjects who had participated or have taken part in another trial within the last 30 days. 
9. Subjects who were planning more than 4 weeks continuous absence from the locality of the 
Investigator Site, between the Screening Visit and the End of Study Visit. 
Treatments 
Treatments Administered 
 
 
The subjects received the first dose of FACTOR X at Visit 1 (Baseline) and the second at Visit 2 (48-72 
hrs post first dose), both were at the Investigator Site under clinical supervision.  
After Visit 2, the subject’s parent(s)/guardian(s) were provided with sufficient FACTOR X for routine 
prophylactic treatment at home between study visits. For the purpose of this study, 'home therapy' 
included any therapy administered to a subject at a clinic local to their home which was not the 
Investigator Site. Alternatively, subjects could return to the Investigator Site to be treated.  
All major bleeding episodes were to be treated under the supervision of a physician. Each subject was 
to undergo treatment for a minimum of 6 months (26 weeks) and complete 50 exposure days. 
FACTOR X administered at the Visit 1 (Baseline), and at the End of study (Visit 5) were calculated and 
rounded to the nearest 0.1 mL. FACTOR X administered for routine prophylaxis or to treat a bleed or 
for preventative use was rounded to the nearest 1 mL. This difference in rounding took into account 
the likely limit of precision in the volume of reconstituted product self-administered by the subject at 
home. 
Selection of Doses in the Study 
Routine prophylaxis therapy in subjects with severe hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies is 
common to avoid development of target joints. Subjects are usually dosed once weekly or twice a 
week, but sometimes more frequently, depending on the severity of the symptoms. The standard dose 
for treating FX deficiency is 10-20 IU FX/kg; or 20-30 IU/kg (based on FX units and adjusted according 
to trough levels) for 1-4 year olds. However, higher doses have been described, such as 70 IU/kg once 
weekly for a 15 year old, 40-80 IU/kg on alternate days in a 5-year old, and 70 IU/kg once weekly in a 
13 year old. 
Plasma FX levels of 10-20 IU/dL are generally accepted to be required for haemostasis in adults. 
Trough levels as low as 5 IU/dL have been found to effectively prevent bleeding in children. For this 
study, a minimum trough level of 5 IU/dL was set for all subjects. 
However, higher trough levels in subjects with a history or family history of intracranial haemorrhage 
were acceptable. 
The recommended routine prophylaxis dose was 40-50 IU/kg twice a week. There is limited 
pharmacokinetic data available in children, however it is suggested that in children incremental 
recovery may be lower and half-life shorter than in adults, thus more frequent dosing in the 0-5 year 
age group could be considered. 
Based on experience from the previous FACTOR X study (Ten01) the recommended dose for a minor 
bleed was 25 IU/kg and major and life-threatening bleed was 50 IU/kg and preventative therapy (for 
example in anticipation of increased physical activity or during rehabilitation of a joint following a 
bleed) was 25 IU/kg. Any unused portion of reconstituted FACTOR X solution was discarded. 
Bolus Dose Before Recovery Assessments 
The recommended bolus doses at the Visit 1 (Baseline) and the End of Study Visit recovery 
assessment visit was 50 IU/kg. This was higher than the bolus dose of 25 IU/kg used in the Ten01 
clinical trial of FACTOR X in adults and adolescents. A higher bolus dose was considered necessary in 
this routine prophylaxis study to maintain a minimum trough level of 10 IU/dL, with twice-weekly 
dosing. 
Dose for routine prophylaxis 
 
Initial doses 
The initial bolus dose of 50 IU/kg of FACTOR X was given at the Visit 1 (Baseline) during recovery 
assessment. 
The second dose of FACTOR X (40-50 IU/kg) was given 72 hours ± 2 hours (Day 4) after the Visit 1 
(Baseline). In the case of subjects in the 0-5 year age group, the second dose of FACTOR X could be 
given at 48 hours ± 2 hours (Day 3) after the Visit 1 (Baseline), at the Investigator’s discretion to 
maintain the minimum trough level. 
Consistent with the Ten01 study and based on pre-clinical toxicology studies, the maximum dose per 
infusion was not to exceed 60 IU/kg. 
Dose adjustment – up to 6 Weeks 
Due to the very scarce data available for dosing in subjects under 12 years of age, and the potential 
for high intra-subject variability in bleeding symptoms, once the second dose had been given and up to 
6 weeks post Visit 1 (Baseline), the Investigator could adjust the dosage regimen, with the aim of 
maintaining trough (pre-infusion) levels of at least 5 IU/dL. The calculated dosage for routine 
prophylaxis was based on the subject’s observed recovery at the Visit 1 (Baseline) and the subsequent 
trough level measurements. During weeks 2-6, the subject attended a minimum of 2 scheduled visits 
(Visit 3 occurring between Day 9-28; Visit 4 occurring between Day 29-42) for measurement of trough 
levels; unscheduled visits for additional trough level measurements were also permitted throughout 
the study. 
To achieve the minimum trough of 5 IU/dL, assuming a half-life of 30 hours and a recovery of 1.5-2.0 
IU/dL per IU/kg, a twice-weekly dose of 40-50 IU/kg was recommended, but was not mandatory. 
Treatment was given no more frequently than every 48 hours, and a maximum peak FX:C of 120 
IU/dL was recommended. The maximum dose per infusion was not to exceed 60 IU/kg. The dosage 
regimen was to be adjusted with the objective of achieving a trough level of at least 5 IU/dL. 
Steady State 
It was expected that after 6 weeks of treatment the subject would have been on a regular dosage 
regimen. However, in any subject receiving coagulation factor replacement therapy on a prophylactic 
regimen, regular monitoring of trough levels and dose adjustment was necessary as bodyweight and 
FX half-life increase. Plasma FX levels were measured at both the central and local laboratories. The 
dose could be adjusted if the subject experienced a break-through bleed or excessive bleeding 
following injury, or the target trough level was not maintained. Any such dose adjustments were 
documented as a Dose Adjustment Unscheduled Visit and followed by an unscheduled trough 
measurement visit within 2 weeks combined with a second dose adjustment visit to confirm that 
adequate trough levels were met and the recovery was as expected. 
Dose to Treat a Bleed 
All major/life-threatening break-through bleeds or excessive bleeding due to injury were treated at the 
Investigator Site. 
Recommended dosage to treat bleeding episodes was 25 IU/kg for a minor bleed and 50 IU/kg for a 
major bleed, which was repeated as often as required based on the FX:C recovery levels and clinical 
need. The dose of 25 IU/kg for minor bleeds was used in another study involving FACTOR X (Ten01) in 
subjects aged 12 years and above, this dose effectively treated bleeding episodes. The higher dose of 
50 IU/kg for major bleeds was introduced in this study to build in flexibility, especially in the case of 
 
very serious bleeds such as intracranial haemorrhage, in which the Investigator might wish to raise 
plasma FX:C close to 100 IU/dL. The maximum dose per infusion was not to exceed 60 IU/kg. 
Justification for any changes from the recommended dose were recorded in the CRF. The subject’s 
weight was documented at regular study visits, and at bleed assessment, trough measurement and 
dose adjustment unscheduled visits, following which the total dose in IU was adjusted accordingly. 
Prior to dosing, a blood sample was taken for FX:C assay, to determine whether the minimum trough 
level of 5 IU/dL was met. While the plasma FX level may have allowed the calculation of an appropriate 
dose of FACTOR X, in urgent cases dosing was not delayed until the result was made available. 
If the subject was discharged while the bleed was ongoing, the Investigator Site staff then contacted 
the subject’s parent/guardian by telephone to re-assess the bleed, at a minimum 24 hours and, if the 
bleed was still ongoing, at 48 hours following the first dose of FACTOR X. 
A single dose was to be given to treat a bleed in the first instance. However, additional doses could be 
given if required until haemostasis was restored. The decision as to whether or not an additional dose 
should be given had to be made by the Investigator and not by a parent/guardian. Therefore, if the 
pain or visible bleeding continued, the subject’s parent/guardian had to contact the Investigator Site. 
The Investigator then assessed if an additional dose was needed and if the subject needed to be 
brought into the hospital. 
Preventative Therapy 
In addition to their routine prophylaxis, subjects could have received additional doses of FACTOR X for 
short periods; for example, in anticipation of increased physical activity, or during rehabilitation of a 
joint following a bleed. This use of FACTOR X was recorded as ‘preventative therapy’. The 
recommended dose was 40-50 IU/kg. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of FACTOR X in the reduction/prevention 
of bleeding when given as routine prophylaxis over 6 months (26 weeks). 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives were: 
1. To assess the pharmacokinetic (FX incremental recovery and trough levels) of FACTOR X after a 
single dose of 50 IU/kg. 
2. To assess the safety of FACTOR X when given as routine prophylaxis over 6 months (26 weeks). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the Investigator’s assessment of efficacy of FACTOR X in the 
reduction/prevention of bleeds when given as routine prophylaxis over 6 months (26 weeks). 
At the End of Study Visit (conducted after 6 months treatment), the Investigator made an assessment 
of the overall efficacy of FACTOR X in reduction/prevention of bleeding when given as routine 
prophylaxis over 6 months (26 weeks). For any subject who withdrew from the study but did not 
 
attend an End of Study Visit, efficacy was assessed by the Investigator if the subject had received at 
least one infusion of FACTOR X. Efficacy was assessed according to the criteria in Table 5. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The analysis set used was the Per-Protocol population. 
For subjects who withdrew from the study, efficacy was assessed if the subject had completed at least 
6 weeks of treatment with FACTOR X. For subjects who completed less than 6 weeks of treatment with 
FACTOR X, efficacy was reported as ‘unassessable’. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the following: 
•  Number of bleeds per month, including severity, duration, location and cause. 
• 
• 
FX:C trough levels at all scheduled study visits and at all Bleed Assessment and Trough 
Measurement unscheduled visits. 
FX:C incremental recovery 30 minute post-dose at the Visit 1 (Baseline) and the End of Study 
Visit based on central laboratory results. 
The investigational medicinal product used in the study contains biologically active compounds which 
are also present endogenously, therefore the FX:C trough levels and incremental recovery are a 
surrogate for efficacy. 
Incremental recovery was defined as the rise in FX:C level recorded at 30 min (± 5 min) after the 
infusion divided by the actual dose administered. 
• 
FX:C incremental recovery and trough levels following any change in dose regimen required for 
clinical reasons/insufficient trough levels. 
 
 
•  Dose of FACTOR X to treat a bleed (IU/kg) (including initial dose for new bleeds and any 
repeated doses for ongoing bleeds), number of infusions to treat a bleed and dose per 
infusion; all analysed on a per-bleed and a per-subject basis. For each value, summary tables 
were produced on a per bleed and a per subject basis. 
• 
Total dose of FACTOR X in IU/kg, total number of infusions and average dose per infusion for: 
prophylactic use, to treat a bleed, any additional preventative use and overall use; all analysed 
on a per subject basis. 
•  Average monthly dose in IU/kg of FACTOR X, and average monthly number of infusions for: 
prophylactic use, to treat a bleed, any additional preventative use, any surgical use and overall 
use; all analysed on a per-subject basis. 
• 
• 
Investigators’ assessment of efficacy as ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘poor’ or ‘unassessable’ in treating 
major bleeds or life-threatening break-through bleeds and excessive bleeding following injury . 
The bleed assessment criteria are detailed in Section 9.5.1.2.1. 
Parents’/Guardians’ assessment of efficacy in treating all bleeds as ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘poor’ or 
‘unassessable’. All bleeds were assessed by the subject’s parent(s)/ guardian(s) as detailed in 
Section 9.5.1.2.1. 
Assessment Criteria for Efficacy in Treating a Bleed 
The clinical manifestation of FX deficiency includes covert (hidden) as well as overt (obvious) bleeds. 
The assessment of efficacy of FACTOR X in treating a bleed depended on the type of bleed to be 
assessed. Efficacy was assessed by the subjects’ parent(s)/guardian(s) for all bleeds and by the 
Investigator or a trained clinician for major bleeds and or life-threatening break-through bleeds and 
excessive bleeding following injury. 
Overt bleeds 
Examples of overt bleeds were epistaxis, tongue/gum bleeds, haematemesis, haematuria, rectal 
bleeding and external wound bleeding due to injury. Overt bleeding was assessed at 12 hours and, if 
necessary, at 24 hours after the first dose of FACTOR X. Efficacy was assessed by the Investigator and 
subject according to the guidelines shown in Table 6. 
 
Bleeding was to be assessed as close to the 12-hour and 24-hour time points as possible. 
Menorrhagia 
Menorrhagia, although an overt bleed, may vary significantly within individuals from one menses to the 
next. Efficacy was based on the number of doses of FACTOR X required in addition to routine 
prophylactic treatment in the peri-menstrual period (the first dose being not more than 1 day before 
commencement of bleeding) to maintain bleeding at a manageable level (i.e. with no significant 
limitation to normal activities), as shown in Table 7 below. 
 
 
 
Covert bleeds 
Examples of covert bleeds were melena, intra-peritoneal bleed, joint bleeds, muscle bleeds, 
intracranial haemorrhage, haematoma/bruising and internal bleeding due to injury. 
Assessment of covert bleeds, which might not have associated pain, was difficult, since it was not 
always possible to ascertain the start and stop time of bleeding, the severity and timescale of response 
to therapy. Cessation of bleeding was judged according to clinical symptoms such as pain, swelling, 
tenderness and mobility, this took into account the fact that some of these symptoms could have 
continued even after the bleed has stopped.  
The following criteria were used to assist the Investigator in making a decision as to when the bleed 
had stopped (Table 8): 
Where possible, at least one objective measurement was recorded, to enable comparison at different 
timepoints after treatment. 
Efficacy was assessed by the Investigator and subject’s parent(s)/guardian(s), based on the number of 
doses of FACTOR X required to achieve haemostasis, according to the guidelines shown in Table 9 
below. The bolus infusion of FACTOR X could be repeated to achieve haemostasis. For gastrointestinal 
ulcers, failure to achieve haemostasis did not equate failure of the efficacy of FACTOR X, since even 
subjects without factor deficiencies would continue to bleed with these lesions. 
 
 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculation was performed, as no formal hypothesis testing was planned. The 
sample size was requested by the EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO). 
Randomisation 
This was a single arm study. All subjects received the same treatment. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
Version 2.0 of the SAP was signed prior to database lock. 
All tables, figures and listings were produced using SAS (v9.3).  
Unless otherwise stated, categorical data are presented using counts and percentages, whilst 
continuous variables are presented using the mean, 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the mean, 
standard deviation (SD, median, minimum, maximum, number of subjects (N), number of events (n) 
and number of missing subjects (or number of surgeries for surgery populations) or data points.  
Minima and maxima are quoted to the number of decimal places as recorded in the CRF; means, SDs 
and medians are quoted to one additional decimal place. Percentages are rounded to one decimal 
place. 
The efficacy analyses were performed for the Per-Protocol population, and the Safety/ITT population 
was to be used to report all safety data, in accordance with the SAP. The definition of Safety/ITT 
population was later re-defined. As per the SAP, demographic data was planned to be reported only for 
the Safety/ITT populations, this was later changed. 
Any subjects enrolled under previous versions of the protocol were included in the analysis populations 
(if they were otherwise eligible). 
Analysis Populations 
In version 2.0 of the SAP the study populations analysed were defined as detailed below: 
Safety/ITT Population 
The safety/ITT population was defined in the protocol as all treated subjects (i.e. all subjects who 
received at least part of one dose of study medication). Safety data were analysed up to the point of 
withdrawal for subjects who withdrew if the number of points were adequate to allow a scientific 
analysis. 
Two subjects had not completed the study as Per-Protocol, these subjects were re-screened and 
enrolled as subjects into the study, therefore the study populations was later re-defined (see Conduct 
of the Study). 
Per-Protocol Population 
 
The Per-Protocol population was defined as all subjects who had completed a minimum of 6 months 
(26 weeks) and a minimum of 50 exposure days of routine prophylactic treatment with FACTOR X at a 
dosing schedule consistent with the protocol. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 9 unique subjects underwent 11 treatment cycles in the study. Two subjects completed 50 
exposure days (EDs), however were withdrawn from the study prior to completing 26 weeks treatment 
with FACTOR X in error. These subjects were then rescreened and enrolled into the study again under 
new subject numbers. 
All 9 unique subjects received at least one dose of FACTOR X during the study and were included in the 
Safety/ITT population. 
Recruitment 
Date first subject enrolled: 20 Apr 2015 
Date last subject completed: 19 Oct 2016 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol Deviations 
A total of 44 deviations were recorded in the Safety/ITT treatment cycle group: 
 
 
 
• 
Four deviations were related to FACTOR X dosing, including 3 related to the less than 50 IU/kg 
bolus doses being administered at incremental recovery assessment due to calculation errors. 
•  One deviation was related to an error in drug accountability. 
• 
Twenty deviations were categorised as laboratory deviations, including blood samples not 
being taken. The majority (14) of these deviations were for subjects in the 0 to 5 year group. 
•  Nine deviations related to visit assessment/schedules not conducted within the timeframe 
specified in the protocol, including the 2 subjects who terminated the study prior to completing 
26 weeks treatment. The majority (7) of these deviations were for subjects in the 0 to 5 year 
group. 
• 
Ten deviations were categorised as other, of which 9 were due to vital signs or infusion site 
observations not being conducted. The remaining deviation was related to a temperature 
excursion in the storage of FACTOR X at the Investigator Site. BPL’s quality assurance (QA) 
department confirmed that the IMP was unaffected and so stock was not replaced. 
Below are brief summaries of protocol deviations which BPL considered significant and where 
appropriate were followed through for further information from the Investigator Site. 
This subject was inadvertently withdrawn from the study prior to completing 26 weeks’ treatment with 
FACTOR X (deviation 027) and so did not meet the definition of the Per-Protocol population (see 
Section 8.1). This subject was re-screened and completed 50 EDs and 26 weeks treatment as subject. 
HCV was negative at Visit 1 (Baseline) and recorded as not done for End of Study Visit in the CRF 
(deviation 023). Subsequent follow-up with site clarified that the test was conducted, but the result 
was not available at the time of database lock and so ‘not done’ was recorded in the CRF. The site 
confirmed the HCV for this subject at the End of Study Visit was negative. 
This subject was inadvertently withdrawn from the study prior to completing 26 weeks treatment with 
FACTOR X (deviation 028) and so did not meet the definition of the Per-Protocol population (see 
Section 8.1). This subject was re-screened and completed 50 EDs and 26 weeks treatment as subject  
HCV testing was not performed at Visit 1 (Baseline), deviation 037. This is subject who was re-
screened and the HCV results were negative at both Visit 1 (Baseline) and End of Study Visit during 
this treatment cycle. The HCV testing for subject HCV was negative at End of Study Visit (V5). 
Therefore, since the result was negative prior to the first dose of FACTOR X in the first treatment cycle 
and at the last dose of FACTOR X in the second treatment cycle, the missing result was not considered 
a significant safety issue. 
Changes in Study Conduct 
Version 2.0 of the Statistical Analysis Plan was finalised prior to database lock. All data, except for 
administrative questions in the CRF, were listed. 
The study was initiated under protocol version 3 (including amendment 2). The following 
amendments were subsequently added: 
Protocol version 4 (including amendment 3): 
•  Name of BPL’s medical contact was changed. 
 
 
 
• 
Further clarification on the type of data required for surgical procedures was provided. 
•  Due to the difficulty of obtaining assent in some children and because this was not a legally 
required the need to obtain assent was withdrawn from the protocol. 
• 
The requirement for a parvovirus test was withdrawn from the study, as there is no strong 
scientific rationale or regulatory requirement for children to have this additional test. 
Protocol version 5 (including amendment 4): 
•  Defining severity of factor X deficiency by just using the subject’s basal plasma FX:C levels 
proved to be misleading due to the fact that:  
the FX:C assays at most hospital laboratories were not sensitive enough to measure 
o 
very low FX levels. 
the data on basal levels was scarce for subjects who commenced routine prophylaxis 
o 
therapy shortly after diagnosis. 
Therefore, severity of factor X deficiency was re-defined to allow for all components that contribute to 
a severe diagnosis to be accurately documented, including genotype. 
•  Clarification was added to explain that a laboratory result considered by the investigator to be 
clinically significant or lead to clinically significant pathological changes from baseline should be 
recorded as an AE. 
•  Revision of bleed assessment criteria. Previous assessment criteria were applicable for on-
demand treatment. These were therefore revised to allow a better efficacy assessment for 
subjects on prophylactic treatment. Also it was clarified that as covert or menorrhagic bleeds 
cannot be timed, a re-assessment of the bleed was not applicable. 
•  Administrative consistency amendments. 
Protocol version 6 (including amendment 5): 
• 
• 
• 
Two subjects completed 4 weeks early in error. As these subjects are rare, the protocol was 
amended to allow the re-enrolment of subjects who had previously taken part in the protocol. 
The definition of the primary efficacy assessment was expanded to include the reduction of 
bleeds. 
Text expanded to clarify that an inhibitor assessment should be conducted if there was a 
clinical suspicion of inhibitor development. 
•  Administrative consistency amendments. 
Changes in Planned Analysis 
Detailed below are changes to the planned analysis following the finalisation of the SAP (V2.0): 
Analysis of retrospective data 
In the statistical analysis plan (SAP) it was planned to analyse the retrospective data separately, as 
well as in combination (where possible) with the data for subjects entering the prospective portion of 
the trial. In practice, limited data was collected on only 3 subjects who had received FACTOR X on a 
 
 
compassionate use basis and no bleeds or related AEs were reported. Therefore, the data was 
presented in a separate Listing and not combined with the prospective data. 
Analysis population 
Eleven treatments cycles were initiated across 9 subjects. Two subjects  completed 50 exposure days, 
but not 26 weeks treatments with FACTOR X. These two subjects were re-screened and completed a 
further treatment cycle as subjects, respectively. The data for these subjects’ first treatment cycle as 
subjects  were excluded from the Per-Protocol analysis. For the Safety/ITT analysis, the data for the 
two treatment cycles for these subjects have been merged. As a result of the re-screening of these two 
subjects, the Safety/ITT group was re-defined and an additional population was included in the 
analysis to allow comparison between first and second treatment periods for the two subjects 
(Safety/ITT treatment cycles). 
•  Safety/ITT analysis set – Re-defined as all unique subjects who received at least one dose 
of study medication. For this analysis the data for subject  was merged with data for subject, 
and data for subject  was merged with, as they are the same patients. Therefore, there were 9 
unique subjects (i.e. N=9). 
•  Safety/ITT Treatment Cycles analysis set – This was a new analysis set and not detailed 
in the SAP. For this analysis set, the data for those re-screened subjects was not merged, and 
was presented separately, therefore N=11. This analysis set was only required for 
demographic/baseline assessments and all Laboratory and vital signs data. 
All the listings generated were for the Safety/ITT treatment cycle population, except in the case of 
infusion data (all the Listings numbered 36). Listings containing the individual and derived infusion 
data were generated for the PP and Safety/ITT populations.  
Statistical testing of incremental recovery (IR) between age groups 
No formal hypothesis testing was planned in the protocol or SAP. A statistical analysis to compare IRs 
between the two age groups was added. The IR values at each visit and across both visits were 
analysed using linear regression models with terms for an overall intercept and age group. The null 
hypothesis was that the age group effect was 0. 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics 
In the SAP, it was planned to only generate Safety/ITT demographic and baseline disease 
characteristics tables. In the final analysis these tables were generated for the PP and Safety/ITT 
treatment cycle populations instead. 
Dose interval 
The analysis of dosing interval for each subject was detailed in the SAP. Initially bolus doses were not 
to be included in the interval calculations, this was later amended as the prophylactic doses were 
scheduled around the bolus doses, therefore, including the bolus doses in the calculations was a more 
sensible approach. In addition, descriptive statistics for dosing intervals on a per infusion basis for all 
subjects and by age group were generated. This was to enable a better overview of prophylactic dosing 
frequencies across the study and in the two age groups. 
Analyses not conducted/Tables not generated 
Adverse events 
 
All the AEs were considered not related, therefore product-related tables for AEs and SAEs were not 
generated. Also none of the AEs led to death or withdrawal, so these listings and tables were not 
applicable. 
Analysis of number of bleeds per month 
Ten bleeds were reported by 4 subjects in the Safety/ITT population, therefore the analysis of bleeds 
per month by severity, duration, location and cause of bleeds was not performed. The data was 
presented in the Listings, and summary tables for bleeds on a per bleed and per subject basis were 
generated. 
Sub-group analysis by severity 
In the SAP, it was planned to analyse data by severity. In practice only 1 subject had moderate FX 
deficiency; therefore this analysis was not conducted. 
Bleed risk category 
All the subjects were considered to be at low risk, therefore a sub-analysis by risk category was not 
applicable. 
Physical examination 
Only one (1) change between Visit 1 (Baseline) and End of Study Visit was recorded for Physical 
examination. All the data was presented in the Listing, therefore a summary table was not generated. 
Infusion site observations 
There were no incidence of infusion site reactions; therefore a summary table was not generated. 
FX inhibitor exposure days 
As per the SAP, if a FX inhibitor was detected the number of exposure days until development of 
inhibitors was to be summarised. No inhibitors were detected or suspected during the study, therefore 
this summary was not required. 
Baseline data 
The demographics of all subjects in the PP population at Visit 1 (Baseline) are summarised in Table 12 
below. The Per-Protocol mean age was 7.3 years with a range of 2.6 to 11.9 years. Four subjects were 
aged between 0 and 5 years, the remaining 5 subjects were aged between 6 and 11 years. The 
majority of subjects were Asian (7, 77.8%) and the remainder were Caucasian/White (2, 22.2%). 
 
 
Baseline Clinical Characteristics and Disease History 
Of the 9 subjects in the Per-Protocol population, all except one subject (i.e. 88.9%) had severe FX 
deficiency. The one remaining subject (11.1%) had moderate disease (Table 13a). Genotyping was 
available for 6 out of the 9 subjects. In the case of subjects, and the lowest FX:C level recorded at the 
time of diagnosis was greater than 1 IU/dL, however the genotyping data confirmed that they all had 
severe FX deficiency. 
 
 
The mean time since diagnosis was 7.2 years and ranged from 2.5 to 11.9 years (Table 13b). 
 
 
Three subjects had administered FACTOR X on a compassionate use basis prior to enrolling in the 
Ten02 study. 
Excluding the previous use of FACTOR X in the PP group all subjects had been exposed to other blood 
products or other factor concentrates. Before entering this study, 3 (33.3%) subjects had been treated 
with other replacement factor concentrates, 5 (55.6%) had been treated with FFP and 1 (11.1%) had 
been treated with other blood products. Listing 20 presents information of the last dose of FX 
containing product prior to Visit 1 (Baseline). 
 
 
Table 14 summarises the bleed history data for the PP population. All the subjects in the PP group 
experienced at least one bleed prior to study entry. Of the 21 bleeds reported the majority were 
spontaneous bleeds (16, 76.1%). 
 
One subject reported a bleed due to surgery (this was prior to starting compassionate use with 
FACTOR X). This surgery (circumcision) was conducted under the cover of Beriflex 120 IU and 
tranexamic acid 300 mg. 
A total of 11 bleeds were reported as ‘other’ which consisted of: blood streaked stool (1), circumcision 
(1), cord bleed (3), haematoma on back (1), intracranial bleed/haemorrhage (2), vomiting small 
amounts of blood (1), umbilical and thigh haematoma (1) and umbilical stump bleed (1). Subjects in 
the 0 to 5 year group reported slightly more bleeding episodes than the older age group. 
A bleeding score (modified Vicenza score) based on that developed for von Willebrand disease was 
used to grade the severity of bleeds in the subject’s disease history. Seven subjects reported 8 bleeds 
(38.1%) with the highest bleed score of 4, four subjects reported 7 bleeds (33.3%) with a bleed score 
of 3. 
All subjects were considered to be at a low risk of break-through bleeds. 
Measurement of Treatment Compliance 
The majority of infusions were administered at home (90.7%). The remaining 9.3% were administered 
at the Investigator Site, these also include all the bolus infusions given at Visit 1 (Baseline) and End of 
Study (Visit 5).  
Significant non-compliances 
Lower bolus doses administered than recommended in the protocol Three subjects had less than 50 
IU/kg administered at Visit 1 (Baseline) due to calculation errors; two of these subjects were excluded 
from the Per-Protocol analysis, as they did not complete 26 weeks treatment. The remaining subject, 
received a lower bolus of 38.8 IU/kg. Prior to the Ten02 study subject was on compassionate use with 
FACTOR X at a dose of (see Section 12.8). 
At the Ten02 Visit 1 (Baseline) the subject weighted 46.4 kg, so a dose of 750 IU equates to 16.2 
IU/kg. The Investigator requested for a lower bolus to be administered, due to theoretical concerns of 
thrombosis. This reduction in dose was approved by the Sponsor. The subject was later administered 
the full bolus dose of 50 IU/kg at the End of Study Visit. 
Diary Cards Missing data 
In one subject the diary cards did not always log the actual number of vials administered. The 
Investigator Site staff therefore made the assumption that the prescribed numbers of vials were 
administered and entered this information on the CRF. However, IMP accountability checks completed 
at a later date indicated that 2 extra unused vials were returned than expected. It was concluded that 
at some point, the subject must have administered 2 fewer prophylactic vials than usual, but it was 
difficult to assess when this may have occurred. Therefore, the database records the administration of 
151 vials of FACTOR X were used, rather than 149 vials which was the actual number of vials used. It 
was confirmed that the subject had completed at least 50 exposure days and 26 weeks treatment and 
so was included in the Per-Protocol analysis. The Sponsor did not consider the administration of fewer 
vials to be clinically significant, as this did not result in break-through bleeding due to failure to reach 
sufficient FX:C trough levels. 
Numbers analysed 
The following datasets were analysed: 
 
Per-Protocol (PP) population: Included 9 subjects who had received at least 50 exposures with 
FACTOR X and had been in the study for at least 6 months. Two subjects’ data were excluded from the 
Per-Protocol (PP) population because the subjects discontinued the study prior to completing 6 months 
treatment (26 weeks), although they had had at least 50 EDs. These 2 subjects were re-screened into 
the study. They were reassigned new subject numbers and completed a further 50 exposures days 
during at least a further 6 months in the study. 
Safety/ITT population: This was redefined as all unique subjects who received at least one dose of 
FACTOR X during the study. So the data for one subject was merged with data for another subject, 
and data for one subject  was merged with another one as they are the same patients. Therefore N 
was 9 for this population. 
Safety/ITT treatment cycle population: This was a new analysis set and was not mentioned in the 
SAP. For this analysis set the data from the re-screened subjects was not merged, and is presented 
separately. This analysis set was only conducted for demographic/baseline assessments and all 
laboratory and vital signs datasets. Therefore N was 11 for this population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Investigator’s assessment of efficacy 
Nine subjects were included in the PP population. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the Investigator’s overall assessment of FACTOR X in reducing or 
preventing bleeding following 6 months (26 weeks) prophylactic. In the Per-Protocol population (N=9) 
prophylactic use with FACTOR X was rated as excellent by the Investigators for all the subjects. 
Excellent was defined as ‘no major or minor bleeds occurred or lower frequency of bleeds than 
expected, given the subjects medical/treatment history’. 
A total of 10 bleeds were reported in 3 (33.3%) subjects in the Per-Protocol group. Three bleeds were 
considered major, 6 were minor and severity was not assessed for the remaining bleed. Of the 10 
bleeds 4 (40%) were treated with FACTOR X. Only a single infusion of FACTOR X was required to treat 
each bleed. 
Two subjects were excluded from the Per-Protocol analysis, as they did not complete 26 weeks 
treatment. The Investigator rated the overall efficacy of FACTOR X as excellent in these subjects. Only 
subject  reported a bleed. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
Incremental Recovery 
 
 
 
FX:C activity levels 
Please see the Clinical pharmacology section for the results. 
Overall FACTOR X usage 
A total of 559 infusions of FACTOR X were administered to 9 subjects in the Per-Protocol population, of 
which 537 were for routine prophylaxis, 4 were for treating bleeds, and 18 were bolus doses at Visit 1 
(Baseline) and End of Study. No infusions were given for short-term preventative use. 
In no case was more than one infusion administered per day, therefore the number of infusions is 
equal to the number of exposure days (EDs). The mean number of infusions per subject was 62.1, 
ranging from 50 to 70. The mean dose per month per subject was 375.88 IU/kg and the mean number 
of infusions per subject per month was 9.70. The mean total dose per subject of FACTOR X consumed 
during the study was 2416.8 IU/kg. 
Prophylactic dose data 
A total of 537 prophylactic infusions were administered across the 26-week treatment cycle, of which 
503 (93.7%) were administered at home, and 34 (6.3%) at the Investigator Site. The mean (SD) 
number of prophylactic infusions per subject was 59.7 (+5.1), with a median dosing interval per 
subject of 3.0 days which ranged from 2 to 8 days. The mean (SD) dose per infusion per subject was 
38.76 IU/kg (+8.98), this ranged from 18.0 to 47.3 IU/kg, Table 20a. 
 
 
 
Slightly higher prophylactic doses were infused by the younger subjects (0-5 years) compared to the 
older subjects; 40.13 and 37.66 IU/kg respectively, resulting in a slightly higher dose per month of 
380.09 IU/kg, compared to 340.24 IU/kg. 
 
 
 
 
Individual subject prophylactic dose data 
A summary of dosing frequency, compliance, and doses for each subject in the Per-Protocol population 
is summarised below (Table 21). Three subjects were also using FACTOR X on compassionate use  
prior to enrolling in the Ten02 study. 
In the protocol the recommended prophylactic dose was 40-50 IU/kg twice a week. 
Dosing regimens varied in the study, these were set at the discretion of the Investigator, which was 
based on each subject’s weight, age and investigator’s knowledge of the subject. 
The dosing schedule for the two subjects excluded from the Per-Protocol analysis is summarised below 
Table 22. 
 
 
 
 
 
Bleeding data 
In the Per-Protocol group, a total of 10 bleeds in 3 subjects were reported. One subject was in the 0 to 
5 year group, the remaining two were aged between 6 to 11 years. Two subjects reported more than 1 
bleed. Data on the bleeds in the Per-Protocol are summarised in Table 23. 
For three (75%) of the bleeds treated the subjects’ parent(s)/guardian(s) rated FACTOR X treatment 
as excellent. Efficacy was not assessed by the parents/guardians for the remaining bleed, Table 23. As 
Per-Protocol, Investigators only assessed efficacy for major bleeds or life-threatening break-through 
bleeds and excessive bleeding following injury. No life-threatening bleeds or excessive bleeding was 
reported. Of the 3 major bleeds treated clinicians’ assessment of efficacy was excellent for two bleeds; 
an assessment was not conducted in the third bleed (menorrhagic bleed). 
 
 
 
Across the whole PP group (N=9) the mean number of bleeds per subject was 1.1, which equates to 
0.178 bleeds per month per subject and the mean dose to treat a bleed was 31.7 IU/kg, which ranged 
from 24.6 to 38.8 IU/kg. 
Surgical data 
There were no surgical interventions in the prospective arm of the study. In the retrospective data 
collection one surgical procedure was reported. 
One subject (0 to 5 age group) 
This subject initially commenced FACTOR X to undergo a surgical procedure (insertion of a central 
venous access device, Portacath). At the time this subject weighted 10.3 kg, so this weight has been 
used to calculate the IU/kg dose.  
During the surgery it is estimated that a total of 2,750 IU (267 IU/kg) of FACTOR X was used across 6 
infusions, 2 infusions were administered on the day of surgery therefore this equates to 5 exposure 
days (EDs). No other concomitant therapy was given and there were no bleeding complication or any 
safety concerns reported. 
After surgery the subject continued using FACTOR X at a prophylactic dose of 500 IU (48.5 IU/kg) 
twice a week for two weeks, until Visit 1 (Baseline) for Ten02. Overall during compassionate use the 
subject received an estimated total of 59,650 IU (5,791 IU/kg) of FACTOR X across 119 infusions (118 
EDs) over 1.07 years (use during surgery and prophylactic treatment). No bleeds, ADRs or any other 
safety concerns were reported during compassionate use.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Trial Ten02 in nine paediatric subjects with severe hereditary FX insufficiency investigated the efficacy 
of routine factor X substitution on bleeding rates. A prophylactic dose of 40-50 IU/kg twice weekly was 
suggested in the protocol, which could be modified by investigators to fit their patients’ needs.  
After 26 weeks, the mean dose per infusion per subject was 38.76 IU/kg, ranging from 18.0 to 47.3 
IU/kg. Dosing intervals from 2 to 8 days were employed, with a mean of 3.1 days.  
The investigator rated the efficacy of prophylactic dosing as excellent in 11 treatment cycles in 9 
subjects. 10 bleeds were reported in the study, of which 4 were treated. One infusion of Coagadex was 
sufficient to control each treated bleeding event. The mean dose to treat a bleed was 31.7 IU/kg, with 
a range from 24.6 to 38.8 IU/kg. A bleeding rate of 0.178 bleeds per month per subject was observed 
during the 26 weeks of prophylactic use of Coagadex. 
Data on surgical use of Coagadex are available for one subject, who underwent an implantation of a 
Port-a-Cath and subsequently received Coagadex prophylactically via a compassionate use programme 
prior to enrolment into Ten02. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Coagadex in the routine prophylaxis of bleeding events as well as the treatment of 
bleeds in children below 12 years of age has been satisfactorily shown.  
The extension of indication can be supported from a clinical efficacy point of view. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evaluation of Coagadex for the initial marketing authorisation was based on safety data 
from clinical studies Ten01 and Ten03, which enrolled 18 subjects (> 12 years) with hereditary factor 
X deficiency.  
In the study Ten01, 16 subjects received at least one dose of FACTOR X for on-demand treatment for 
bleeds, for prophylaxis of bleeds and/or for controlling bleeding during surgical procedures. The mean 
(±SD) duration of study participation was 457.9 (±284.32) days per subject. During this time, there 
were a total of 468 infusions given of which 242 were for treatment of bleeds, 184 as preventative 
treatment, 31 for PK assessments, 6 for surgical procedures and 5 at a batch change. 
The number of infusions of Coagadex overall ranged from 5 to 115 per subject with a median of 20.0 
per subject. Mean total number of infusions per subject given for overall use was 29.3. Exposure days 
per subject ranged from 3 to 111, median 17.0 days. The monthly average use, for all uses, ranged 
from 0.3 to 9.6 (mean 2.33) infusions per subject per month. 
The mean dose per infusion overall was 25.47 IU/kg per subject. The recommended dose of 25 IU/kg 
Coagadex to treat a bleed was maintained during the study for 14 of the 16 subjects. The other two 
subjects used doses of up to 30 IU/kg and 33 IU/kg. 
In the study Ten03, 2 male subjects, received Coagadex for controlling haemostasis during two 
surgical procedures each. Their surgical procedures were all regarded as major by the DRC: one 
subject had a coronary artery bypass graft and, at a later date, six dental extractions; the other 
subject had two total knee arthroplasties about 4 months apart. 
Coagadex intravenous infusions were well tolerated. The adverse event profile of Coagadex did not 
reveal any unexpected safety signals. Only a minority of AEs were considered as related by the 
investigator (6/202: 3%): Two subjects (12.5%) in study Ten01 experienced a total of six events. No 
SAE was considered related to treatment with FX.  
An analysis for adverse events of special interest (allergic reactions, thrombotic events, adverse events 
related to bleeding, infections and hepatobiliary events) was submitted to complete the overall safety 
evaluation of Coagadex. No occurrences of these AESIs could be identified in the database. 
FACTOR X use was not associated with any clinically significant abnormality in clinical laboratory 
parameters or physical signs. There was no evidence to suggest that FACTOR X induced factor X 
inhibitor. Shifts of thrombogenicity markers were observed in some subjects, but no clinical signs or 
symptoms of thrombosis were observed in any subject.  
No drug-drug or drug-food interactions were reported in the studies. Due to the limited size of the 
investigated population no detailed analyses and predictions could be made for special populations and 
situations. The accidental overdosing of one subject had no apparent sequelae. 
During compassionate use of FACTOR X a miscarriage occurred. A relation to FACTOR X treatment 
appears to be unlikely. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials (back pain, infusion site 
erythema, fatigue and infusion site pain) have been included in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics section 4.8 as common. 
Patient exposure 
9 subjects were enrolled into study Ten02, 4 in the 0-5 age group and 5 in the 6-11 age group. 
Two subjects  completed 50 EDs, however inadvertently withdrew from the study prior to completing 
26 weeks treatment. These subjects were re-screened and re-entered into the study as subjects. The 
data for these subjects’ first treatment cycle as subjects  were excluded from the Per-Protocol analysis. 
For the Safety/ITT analysis the data for the two treatment cycles for these subjects has been merged 
to assess overall exposure and safety for each subject. Therefore the data of 9 unique subjects has 
been assessed for the Safety/ITT analysis. 
In the 9 unique subjects a total of 665 EDs were experienced with a mean of 73.9 EDs per subject 
(Table 26a). The mean dose per infusion was 38.99 IU/kg, which equates to 926.69 IU (Section 14, 
Table 3.1.1). Therefore, the total amount of FACTOR X used in the prospective study was 25,928.4 
IU/kg (616,248.9 IU). 
 
Adverse events 
Eight unique subjects (88.9%) experienced at least one TEAE. Two TEAEs in one subject were 
considered serious (SAE). All TEAEs were considered unrelated to FACTOR X. The majority of TEAEs 
were mild in severity, 92.9% (Table 27). 
As mentioned previously, the exposure period data for the re-screened subjects has been combined 
with their second treatment cycle, respectively. During the first treatment subject reported no AEs, 
whereas subject  reported 2 TEAEs, , both unrelated to FACTOR X, no further action was taken and the 
TEAEs resolved. 
Analysis of Adverse Events 
The most common TEAEs were pyrexia and nasopharyngitis, both with 4 events in 3 (33.3%) unique 
subjects (Table 28). All 4 unique subjects in the 0 to 5 age group reported at least 1 TEAE, they also 
reported more TEAEs (20 events) compared with the older age group (Listing 32.1). These were 
mainly pyrexia, bacterial or viral infections, rhinitis, nasopharyngitis or coughs. 
 
 
 
 
None of the AEs reported during the study were considered related to FACTOR X. 
Infusion Site Observations 
Infusion site observations (for discomfort, erythema, induration, tenderness and warmth) were 
performed by a nurse or site clinician at pre-dose and immediately before each post-dose sample 
collection at the Visit 1 (Baseline) and at the End of Study Visit assessment. 
The majority of unique subjects (6, 66.7%) had FACTOR X administered via a venous access device, 
Portacath. Subject was administered a total of 63 infusions, site of administration was only provided 
for 3 infusions (the left arm), for the remaining infusions, the site of administration was unknown. 
Subject had 50 infusions of which 3 were administered into the right/left arm; for the remaining 
infusions site of administration was unknown. Subject had 64 infusions all administered into the right 
arm. No infusion site discomfort, erythema, induration, tenderness or warmth was reported during the 
study. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported during the study.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology, Biochemistry 
No apparent trends of abnormality were observed in any of the laboratory indicators during the study 
period. There were no clinically significant trends or changes from Screening Visit in clinical 
haematology and biochemistry measurements. 
 
 
 
 
 
Viral Serology 
No changes in viral serology from Visit 1(Baseline) to End of Study Visit were observed during the 
study. 
Factor X inhibitor 
It was planned to archive all the Visit 1 (Baseline) FX inhibitor samples and only analyse these if an 
inhibitor was detected. All the End of Study Visit samples were analysed at the central laboratory. In 
the case of subject the Visit 1 (Baseline) sample was analysed in error. All the samples tested had a 
negative inhibitor screen and a Nijmegen-Bethesda quantitative value of less than 0.6 BU, thus no 
signs of inhibitor development. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no withdrawals due to an AE. 
Post marketing experience 
The first approval for marketing worldwide was granted in the United States on 20 October 2015 
(International Birth Date, IBD). Following the first approval, it was further approved in the 28 EU 
member states via a centralised procedure on 16 March 2016. Overall, Coagadex is currently 
authorized in 29 countries worldwide. It was launched in the USA on 7 December 2015, in the UK on 7 
June 2016 and in Germany on 28 October 2016. Launch was pending in the remaining 25 EU countries 
at the DLP of the PSUR. 
Post-marketing data (and clinical trial data) are provided in the second Periodic Safety Update Report 
(PSUR) for Coagadex, covering the cumulative data from 20 October 2015 (International Birth Date 
[IBD]) to 16 September 2017 (data lock point [DLP]) as well as for the reporting interval from 17 
March 2016 to 16 September 2017 (PSUR Coagadex dated 13 October 2017). 
During the 23 cumulative months of post-marketing experience, a total of were distributed. Based on 
the mean monthly usage of Coagadex from the clinical trials (Ten01, Ten03) of 2.33 infusions the 
distribution of almost assuming a mean patient weight of 68 kg and a mean dose of 25 IU/Kg. 
Alternatively, the post-marketing exposure could be considered as. 
Cumulatively, since the IBD (20 October 2015) to 16 September 2017 (DLP of PSUR), there have been 
no serious adverse reactions reported. A total of nine non-serious adverse reactions (abdominal pain, 
arthralgia, joint swelling, dizziness, hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia, cough, pruritus generalised and 
urticaria) have been reported in three spontaneous case reports (PSUR Coagadex dated 13 October 
2017). None of these reactions is in the current prescribing information but they were single reports. 
However, hypersensitivity is included as a warning (e.g. pruritus generalised and urticaria); the 
currently listed adverse reactions are infusion site erythema, infusion site pain, fatigue and back pain. 
These three case reports do not require any changes to be made to the safety sections of the current 
prescribing information. 
 
 
 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety data from trial Ten02 encompass 9 subjects who were enrolled for 11 treatment 
cycles of twice weekly prophylactic administration of Coagadex for 26 weeks, resulting in a minimum 
of 50 and a maximum of 116 exposure days.  
Coagadex was well tolerated and no treatment emergent adverse events were assessed as related to 
study treatment and no subject left the study due to an AE. 
No local infusion reactions were observed, neither for infusions administered via a venous access 
device nor given directly into a vein. 
The important identified risks for Coagadex are hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, including 
anaphylaxis, please see RMP. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The observed safety profile is therefore considered to be favourable and to support the use of 
Coagadex in children. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 07 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2., 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Coagadex (INN) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised 
after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hereditary factor X deficiency is a rare haemophilia caused by the inherited lack of coagulation factor 
X. Factor X deficiency can result in bleeding patterns similar to, if less frequent than, those seen in 
males with haemophilia A or B. Unlike haemophilia A and B, however, the gene for factor X is located 
on the long arm of chromosome 13. Therefore, both genders can be carriers and both can develop 
factor X deficiency. 
The prevalence of severe factor X deficiency in the general population is approximately 1 in 1 million, 
which puts it between one hundredth and one twentieth of the prevalence of haemophilia A and B, 
respectively. 
Factor X deficiency varies in severity, which is defined according to the endogenous level of factor X in 
the plasma. Severe factor X deficiency is defined as endogenous concentration of factor X being <1% 
(< 1 IU/dL); moderate deficiency is when the factor X level is 1-5%; and mild deficiency is when factor 
X level is >5%. The level of endogenous factor X activity in the general population has been reported a 
65 to 120 IU/dL. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Coagadex is a human plasma-derived coagulation factor X that is used as a replacement therapy in 
patients with hereditary factor X deficiency. It is the only specific factor replacement option available 
and was licensed in March 2016 in the EU. 
It is possible to treat bleeding events with coagulation factor compounds like FFP or prothrombin 
complex concentrates. However dosing of FX with these products is difficult and the danger of 
elevating other coagulation factors into the supraphysiological range with the consequent potential 
complications of thrombosis and embolism and, due to the large volumes needed, of fluid overload are 
limiting factors for optimal treatment. 
 
Another alternative treatment is an anti-fibrinolytic, such as tranexamic acid. In general, this 
medication is usually used as an adjunct to one of the above options especially in anatomical sites 
where endogenous fibrinolytic activity is high. It can be used alone for mild deficiency or for minor 
bleeding episodes. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Trial Ten02 was an open-label, non-randomized study investigating the efficacy, safety and certain PK 
parameters of Coagadex in 9 paediatric subjects below 12 years of age. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A prophylactic dose of 40-50 IU/kg twice weekly was suggested in the protocol, which could be 
modified by investigators to fit their patients’ needs. After 26 weeks, the mean dose per infusion per 
subject was 38.76 IU/kg, ranging from 18.0 to 47.3 IU/kg. Dosing intervals from 2 to 8 days were 
employed, with a mean of 3.1 days.  
The investigator rated the efficacy of prophylactic dosing as excellent in 11 treatment cycles in 9 
subjects.  
10 bleeds were reported in the study, of which 4 were treated. One infusion of Coagadex was sufficient 
to control each treated bleeding event. The mean dose to treat a bleed was 31.7 IU/kg, with a range 
from 24.6 to 38.8 IU/kg. A bleeding rate of 0.178 bleeds per month per subject in the per protocol 
analysis set was observed during the 26 weeks of prophylactic use of Coagadex. 
The incremental recovery for the two age cohorts was established with a mean of 1.53 for the 0-5 year 
old subjects and a mean of 1.91 for the 6-11 year old subjects. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
None. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The clinical safety data from trial Ten02 encompass 9 subjects who were enrolled for 11 treatment 
cycles of twice weekly prophylactic administration of Coagadex for 26 weeks, resulting in a minimum 
of 50 and a maximum of 116 exposure days.  
Coagadex was well tolerated and no treatment emergent adverse events were assessed as related to 
study treatment and no subject left the study due to an AE. 
No local infusion reactions were observed, neither for infusions administered via a venous access 
device nor given directly into a vein. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
None.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Coagadex is able to replace the missing coagulation factor X and to prevent and treat bleeding events 
in children with congenital factor X deficiency, an extremely rare form of haemophilia. This is 
considered an important beneficial treatment option for these patients, analogous to prophylactic and 
therapeutic replacement of factor VIII or factor IX, which is established in haemophilia A or B. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The observed favourable effects on bleeding rates and treatment of bleeds were accompanied by a 
benign safety profile.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance in children below 12 years enrolled in trial Ten02 of age is comparable to what 
was established in adolescents and adults in trials Ten01 and Ten03. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Coagadex is positive.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
 
 
 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification 
by 10 August 2018. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the 
EMA website 
at http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2012/03/WC500124536.pdf. 
2. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated 
version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion 
should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
3. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after 
the Commission Decision, or prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. For additional 
guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for eCTD Submissions in the EU.

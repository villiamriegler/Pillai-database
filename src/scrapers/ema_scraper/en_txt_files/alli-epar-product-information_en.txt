1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
alli 60 mg hard capsules 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each hard capsule contains 60 mg orlistat. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Hard capsule. 
The capsule has a dark blue centre band, and a turquoise cap and body bearing the imprint of “alli”. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
alli is indicated for weight loss in adults who are overweight (body mass index, BMI, 28 kg/m2) and 
should be taken in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric, lower-fat diet. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults 
The recommended treatment dose is one 60 mg capsule to be taken three times daily. No more than 
three 60 mg capsules should be taken in 24 hours. 
Diet and exercise are important parts of a weight loss programme. It is recommended that a diet and 
exercise programme is started before beginning treatment with alli. 
While taking orlistat, the patient should be on a nutritionally balanced, mildly hypocaloric diet that 
contains approximately 30% of calories from fat (e.g. in a 2,000 kcal/day diet, this equates to <67 g 
of fat). The daily intake of fat, carbohydrate and protein should be distributed over three main meals. 
The diet and exercise programme should continue to be followed when treatment with alli is stopped. 
Treatment should not exceed 6 months. 
If patients have been unable to lose weight after 12 weeks of treatment with alli, they should consult 
their doctor or a pharmacist. It may be necessary to discontinue treatment. 
Special populations 
Elderly (>65 years old) 
There are limited data on the use of orlistat in the elderly. However, as orlistat is minimally absorbed, 
no dose adjustment is necessary in the elderly.

Hepatic and renal impairment 
The effect of orlistat in individuals with hepatic and/or renal impairment has not been studied (see 
section 4.4). However, as orlistat is minimally absorbed, no dose adjustment is necessary in 
individuals with hepatic and/or renal impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of alli in children below 18 years of age has not been established. No data are 
available. 
Method of administration 
The capsule should be taken with water immediately before, during or up to 1 hour after each main 
meal. If a meal is missed or contains no fat, the dose of orlistat should be omitted. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
Concurrent treatment with ciclosporin (see section 4.5) 
Chronic malabsorption syndrome 
Cholestasis 
Pregnancy (see section 4.6) 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) 
Concurrent treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8) 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Gastrointestinal symptoms 
Patients should be advised to adhere to the dietary recommendations they are given (see section 4.2). 
The possibility of experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase when orlistat 
is taken with an individual meal or a diet high in fat. 
Fat-soluble vitamins 
Treatment with orlistat may potentially impair the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) 
(see section 4.5). For this reason, a multivitamin supplement should be taken at bedtime. 
Antidiabetic medicinal products 
As weight loss may be accompanied by improved metabolic control in diabetes, patients who are 
taking a medicinal product for diabetes should consult a doctor before starting treatment with alli, in 
case it is necessary to adjust the dose of the antidiabetic medicinal product. 
Medicinal products for hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia 
Weight loss may be accompanied by an improvement in blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Patients 
who are taking a medicinal product for hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia should consult a doctor 
or pharmacist when taking alli, in case it is necessary to adjust the dose of these medicinal products. 
Amiodarone 
Patients who are taking amiodarone should consult a doctor before starting treatment with alli (see 
section 4.5). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rectal bleeding 
Cases of rectal bleeding have been reported in patients taking orlistat. If this occurs, the patient should 
consult a doctor. 
Oral contraceptives 
The use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral 
contraception that could occur in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5). 
Kidney disease 
Patients with kidney disease should consult a doctor before starting treatment with alli, as the use of 
orlistat may be associated with hyperoxaluria and oxalate nephropathy leading sometimes to renal 
failure. This risk is increased in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease and/or volume 
depletion. 
Levothyroxine 
Hypothyroidism and/or reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur when orlistat and levothyroxine 
are co-administered (see section 4.5). Patients taking levothyroxine should consult a doctor before 
starting treatment with alli, as orlistat and levothyroxine may need to be taken at different times and 
the dose of levothyroxine may need to be adjusted. 
Antiepileptic medicinal products 
Patients taking an antiepileptic medicinal product should consult a doctor before starting treatment 
with alli, as they should be monitored for possible changes in the frequency and severity of 
convulsions. If this occurs, consideration could be given to administering orlistat and antiepileptic 
medicinal products at different times (see section 4.5). 
Antiretrovirals for HIV 
Patients should consult a physician before taking alli concomitantly with antiretroviral medicinal 
products. Orlistat may potentially reduce the absorption of antiretroviral medicinal products for HIV 
and could negatively affect the efficacy of antiretroviral medicinal products for HIV (see section 4.5). 
Information concerning excipients 
alli 60 mg hard capsules contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Ciclosporin 
A decrease in ciclosporin plasma levels has been observed in a drug-drug interaction study and also 
reported in several cases, when orlistat was administered concomitantly. This could potentially lead to 
a decrease of immunosuppressive efficacy. Concurrent use of alli and ciclosporin is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Oral anticoagulants 
When warfarin or other oral anticoagulants are given in combination with orlistat, international 
normalised ratio (INR) values could be affected (see section 4.8). Concurrent use of alli and warfarin 
or other oral anticoagulants is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oral contraceptives 
The absence of an interaction between oral contraceptives and orlistat has been demonstrated in 
specific drug-drug interaction studies. However, orlistat may indirectly reduce the availability of oral 
contraceptives and lead to unexpected pregnancies in some individual cases. An additional 
contraceptive method is recommended in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.4). 
Levothyroxine 
Hypothyroidism and/or reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur when orlistat and levothyroxine 
are taken at the same time (see section 4.4). This could be due to a decreased absorption of iodine salts 
and/or levothyroxine. 
Antiepileptic medicinal products 
Convulsions have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and antiepileptic 
medicinal products e.g. valproate, lamotrigine, for which a causal relationship to an interaction cannot 
be excluded. Orlistat may decrease the absorption of antiepileptic medicinal products, leading to 
convulsions. 
Antiretroviral medicinal products 
Based on reports from literature and post-marketing experience orlistat may potentially reduce the 
absorption of antiretroviral medicinal products for HIV and could negatively affect the efficacy of 
antiretroviral medicinal product for HIV (see section 4.4). 
Fat-soluble vitamins 
Treatment with orlistat may potentially impair the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K). 
The vast majority of subjects receiving up to 4 full years of treatment with orlistat in clinical studies 
had vitamin A, D, E and K and beta-carotene levels that stayed within normal range. However, 
patients should be advised to use a multivitamin supplement at bedtime to help ensure adequate 
vitamin intake (see section 4.4). 
Acarbose 
In the absence of pharmacokinetic interaction studies, alli is not recommended to be used by patients 
receiving acarbose. 
Amiodarone 
A decrease in plasma levels of amiodarone, when given as a single dose, has been observed in a 
limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat concomitantly. The clinical relevance of 
this effect in patients receiving amiodarone treatment remains unknown. Patients who are taking 
amiodarone should consult a doctor before starting treatment with alli. The dose of amiodarone may 
need to be adjusted during treatment with alli. 
Antidepressants, antipsychotics (including lithium) and benzodiazepines 
There are some case reports of reduced efficacy of antidepressants, antipsychotics (including lithium) 
and benzodiazepines coincidental to the initiation of orlistat treatment in previously well controlled 
patients. Therefore orlistat treatment should only be initiated after careful consideration of the possible 
impact in these patients.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
The use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral 
contraception that could occur in case of severe diarrhoea (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
For orlistat, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition 
or postnatal development (see section 5.3). 
alli is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
As it is not known whether orlistat is secreted into human milk, alli is contraindicated 
during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Orlistat has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions to orlistat are largely gastrointestinal in nature and related to the pharmacologic 
effect of the medicinal product on preventing the absorption of ingested fat. 
The gastrointestinal adverse reactions identified from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg of 18 months 
to 2 years duration were generally mild and transient. They generally occurred early in treatment 
(within 3 months) and most patients experienced only one episode. Consumption of a diet low in fat 
will decrease the likelihood of experiencing adverse gastrointestinal reactions (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as: 
very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100), rare 
(1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). 
The frequencies of adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use of orlistat are not known as 
these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size. 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily for 15 days have 
been studied in normal weight and obese subjects without significant clinical findings. In addition, 
doses of 240 mg three times daily have been administered to obese patients for 6 months. The majority 
of orlistat overdose cases received during post-marketing reported either no adverse reactions or 
adverse reactions that are similar to those reported with recommended doses of orlistat. 
In the event of an overdose, medical advice should be sought. Should a significant overdose of orlistat 
occur, it is recommended that the patient be observed for 24 hours. Based on human and animal 
studies, any systemic effects attributable to the lipase-inhibiting properties of orlistat should be rapidly 
reversible. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiobesity preparations, excl. diet products, peripherally acting 
antiobesity products, ATC code: A08AB01. 
Orlistat is a potent, specific and long-acting inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases. It exerts its therapeutic 
activity in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine by forming a covalent bond with the active 
serine site of the gastric and pancreatic lipases. The inactivated enzyme is thus unavailable to 
hydrolyse dietary fat, in the form of triglycerides, into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides. 
From clinical studies, it has been estimated that orlistat 60 mg taken three times daily blocks the 
absorption of approximately 25% of dietary fat. The effect of orlistat results in an increase in faecal fat 
as early as 24 to 48 hours after dosing. Upon discontinuation of therapy, faecal fat content returns to 
pre-treatment levels, usually within 48 to 72 hours. 
Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI 28 kg/m2 support the 
efficacy of orlistat 60 mg taken three times daily in conjunction with a hypocaloric, lower-fat diet. The 
primary parameter, change in body weight from baseline (time of randomisation), was assessed for 
body weight over time (Table 1) and the percentage of subjects who lost 5% or 10% of body weight 
(Table 2). Although weight loss was assessed during 12 months of treatment in both studies, most 
weight loss occurred within the first 6 months.

The weight loss induced by orlistat 60 mg conferred other important health benefits after 6 months of 
treatment in addition to weight loss. The mean relative change in total cholesterol was -2.4% for 
orlistat 60 mg (baseline 5.20 mmol/l) and +2.8% for placebo (baseline 5.26 mmol/l). The mean 
relative change in LDL cholesterol was -3.5% for orlistat 60 mg (baseline 3.30 mmol/l) and +3.8% for 
placebo (baseline 3.41 mmol/l). For waist circumference, the mean change was -4.5 cm for 
orlistat 60 mg (baseline 103.7 cm) and -3.6 cm for placebo (baseline 103.5 cm). All comparisons 
against placebo were statistically significant. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Studies in normal weight and obese volunteers have shown that the extent of absorption of orlistat was 
minimal. Plasma concentrations of intact orlistat were non-measurable (<5 ng/ml) 8 hours following 
oral administration of orlistat 360 mg. 
In general, at therapeutic doses, detection of intact orlistat in plasma was sporadic and concentrations 
were extremely low (<10 ng/ml or 0.02 µmol), with no evidence of accumulation, which is consistent 
with minimal absorption. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution cannot be determined because the active substance is minimally absorbed 
and has no defined systemic pharmacokinetics. In vitro, orlistat is >99% bound to plasma proteins 
(lipoproteins and albumin were the major binding proteins). Orlistat minimally partitions into 
erythrocytes. 
Biotransformation 
Based on animal data, it is likely that the metabolism of orlistat occurs mainly within the 
gastrointestinal wall. Based on a study in obese patients, of the minimal fraction of the dose that was 
absorbed systemically, two major metabolites, M1 (4-member lactone ring hydrolysed) and 
M3 (M1 with N-formyl leucine moiety cleaved), accounted for approximately 42% of the total plasma 
concentration. 
M1 and M3 have an open beta-lactone ring and extremely weak lipase inhibitory activity 
(1,000- and 2,500-fold less than orlistat, respectively). In view of this low inhibitory activity and the 
low plasma levels at therapeutic doses (average of 26 ng/ml and 108 ng/ml, respectively), these 
metabolites are considered to be pharmacologically inconsequential. 
Elimination 
Studies in normal weight and obese subjects have shown that faecal excretion of the unabsorbed active 
substance was the major route of elimination. Approximately 97% of the administered dose was 
excreted in faeces and 83% of that as unchanged orlistat. 
The cumulative renal excretion of total orlistat-related materials was <2% of the given dose. The time 
to reach complete excretion (faecal plus urinary) was 3 to 5 days. The disposition of orlistat appeared 
to be similar between normal weight and obese volunteers. Orlistat, M1 and M3 are all subject to 
biliary excretion. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to fertility, 
reproduction and development. 
The medicinal use of orlistat is unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic or terrestrial environment. 
However, any possible risk should be avoided (see section 6.6).

INSTRUCTIONS ON USE 
For adults with a BMI of 28 or above 
Weight loss aid 
Can help you lose more weight than dieting alone. 
alli is used for weight loss alongside reduced calorie, lower-fat meals in overweight (BMI 28 or 
above) adults, aged 18 or over. 
alli can help you lose more weight than dieting alone. The capsules work only in your digestive system 
to stop about a quarter of the fat in your meals from being absorbed. This fat passes out of your body 
and may cause changes to your bowel movements. Eat lower-fat meals to help manage these effects. 
To see if your BMI is 28 or above, find your height on the chart. If you weigh less than the weight 
shown for your height, your BMI is below 28 - do not use alli.

INSTRUCTIONS ON USE 
Weight loss aid 
Can help you lose more weight than dieting alone. 
alli is used for weight loss alongside reduced calorie, lower-fat meals in overweight adults, aged 18 or 
over. 
alli is clinically proven to help you lose more weight than dieting alone. The capsules work only in 
your digestive system to stop about a quarter of the fat in your meals from being absorbed. This fat 
passes out of your body and may cause changes to your bowel movements. Eat lower-fat meals to help 
manage these effects. 
How to use 
take one capsule whole with water, three times a day with each main meal containing fat. 
do not take more than three capsules a day. 
you should take a multivitamin (containing vitamins A, D, E and K) once a day, at bedtime. 
you should not take alli for more than six months.

loss in adults aged 18 and over who are overweight, and have a body mass index (BMI) of 28 or 
above. alli should be used along with a reduced calorie, lower-fat diet.

Risk of being overweight 
Being overweight increases your risk of developing several serious health problems such as diabetes 
and heart disease. These conditions may not cause you to feel unwell so you should see your doctor 
for a general health check. 
How alli works 
The active substance (orlistat) in alli is designed to target fat in your digestive system. It stops about a 
quarter of the fat in your meals from being absorbed. This fat will pass out of the body in your stools 
(see section 4). It is therefore important that you commit to a lower-fat diet to manage these effects. If 
you do, the action of the capsules will assist your efforts by helping you to lose more weight compared 
to dieting alone. For every 2 kg (4 lb) you lose from dieting alone, alli might help you lose up to 1 kg 
(2 lb) more. 
2.  What you need to know before you take alli

contain vitamins A, D, E and K. You should take the multivitamin at bedtime, when you will 
not be taking alli, to help ensure that the vitamins are absorbed.

alli with food and drink 
alli should be used along with a reduced calorie, lower-fat diet. Try to start this diet before beginning 
treatment. For information on how to set your calorie and fat targets, see Further helpful information 
in the blue pages in section 6. 
alli can be taken immediately before, during a meal or up to one hour after a meal. The capsule should 
be swallowed with water. This usually means one capsule at breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you miss a 
meal, or your meal contains no fat, do not take a capsule. alli does not work unless there is some fat in 
the meal. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you eat a high-fat meal, do not take more than the recommended dose. Taking the capsule with a 
meal containing too much fat may increase your chance of getting diet-related treatment effects (see 
section 4). Make every effort to avoid any high-fat meals while taking alli. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take alli if you are pregnant or breast-feeding 
Driving and using machines 
alli is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
alli contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take alli 
Preparing to lose weight 
1. 
Choose your start date 
Choose the day you will start taking the capsules ahead of time. Before you start taking the capsules, 
begin your reduced calorie, lower-fat diet and give your body a few days to adjust to your new eating 
habits. Keep a record of what you are eating in a food diary. Food diaries are effective, because they 
make you aware of what you are eating, how much you eat, and give you the basis to make changes. 
2. 
Decide on your weight loss goal 
Think about how much weight you want to lose and then set a target weight. A realistic goal is to lose 
between 5% to 10% of your starting weight. The amount of weight you lose may vary from week to 
week. You should aim to lose weight at a gradual, steady pace of about 0.5 kg (1 lb) per week. 
3. 
Set your calorie and fat targets 
To help you reach your weight-loss goal you need to set two daily targets, one for calories and one for 
fat. For further advice see Further helpful information in the blue pages in section 6. 
Taking alli 
Adults 18 and over 
- 
- 
Take one capsule, three times a day. 
Take alli just before, during or up to one hour after meals. This usually means one capsule at 
breakfast, lunch and dinner. Make sure your three main meals are well balanced, reduced 
calorie, and lower-fat. 
If you miss a meal, or your meal contains no fat, do not take a capsule. alli does not work unless 
there is some fat in the meal. 
Swallow the capsule whole with water. 
Do not take more than 3 capsules a day. 
You can keep your daily dose of alli in the blue carry case (shuttle) included in this pack. 
Eat lower-fat meals to reduce the chance of diet-related treatment effects (see section 4). 
Try to be more physically active before you start taking the capsules. Physical activity is an 
important part of a weight loss programme. Remember to check with your doctor first if you 
have not exercised before. 
Continue to be active while taking alli and after you stop taking it.

How long should I take alli for? 
- 
- 
- 
alli should not be taken for more than six months. 
If you do not lose weight after taking alli for 12 weeks, see your doctor or pharmacist for 
advice. You may need to stop taking alli. 
Successful weight loss is not just about eating differently for a short period of time before 
reverting to your old habits. People who lose weight and maintain the loss make lifestyle 
changes, which include changes to what they eat and how active they are. 
If you take more alli than you should 
Do not take more than 3 capsules a day. 
➔ 
If you have taken too many capsules, contact a doctor as soon as possible. 
If you forget to take alli 
If you miss taking a capsule: 
- 
- 
If it is less than an hour since your last main meal, take the missed capsule. 
If it is more than an hour since your last main meal, do not take the missed capsule. Wait and 
take the next capsule around your next main meal as usual. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not 
listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in 
Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this 
medicine. 
Learn to deal with alli effects related to your diet or fat intake 
The most common side effects are caused by the way the capsules work and result from some of the 
fat being passed out of your body. Such effects typically occur within the first few weeks of using the 
capsules, before you may have learnt to limit the amount of fat in your diet. Such diet-related 
treatment effects may be a signal that you have eaten more fat than you should have done. 
You can learn to minimise the impact of diet-related treatment effects by following these guidelines: 
- 
Start your lower-fat diet a few days, or even a week, before you begin taking the capsules. 
- 
Find out more about how much fat your favourite foods typically contain, and the size of your 
portions. By familiarising yourself with portions you will be less likely to accidentally exceed 
your fat target. 
Distribute your fat allowance evenly across your meals for the day. Do not “save up” fat and 
calorie allowances and then splurge on a high-fat meal or dessert, as you may have done on 
other weight loss programmes. 
Most users who experience these effects find that they can manage and control them by 
adjusting their diet. 
- 
- 
Do not be concerned if you do not experience any of these problems. This does not mean that the 
capsules are not working. 
5. 
How to store alli 
- 
-

Helpful tips on your diet and your calorie and fat targets while taking alli 
alli should be used along with a reduced calorie, lower-fat diet. The capsules work by preventing some 
of the fat you eat from being absorbed but you can still eat foods from all the main food groups. 
Although you should focus on the calories and fat that you eat, it is important to eat a balanced diet. 
You should choose meals which contain a range of different nutrients and learn to eat healthily for the 
long term. 
Understanding the importance of calorie and fat targets 
Calories are a measurement of the energy your body needs. They are sometimes called kilocalories or 
kcal. Energy may also be measured in kilojoules, which you may also see on food labels. 
- 
The calorie target is the maximum number of calories you will eat each day. See the chart 
further on in this section. 
Your fat gram target is the maximum number of grams of fat you will eat in each meal. The fat 
gram target chart follows the information below on setting your calorie target. 
Controlling your fat target is essential because of the way the capsules work. Taking alli means 
your body will pass more fat through, and therefore may struggle to cope with eating as much 
fat as before. So by meeting your fat target, you will maximise weight loss results while 
minimising the risk of diet-related treatment effects. 
You should aim to lose weight gradually and steadily. Losing around 0.5 kg (1 lb) per week is 
ideal.

How to set your calorie target 
The following table has been worked out so that it gives you a calorie target that is about 500 calories 
fewer per day than your body needs to maintain your current weight. That adds up to 3500 fewer 
calories per week, about the number of calories in 0.5 kg (1 lb) of fat. 
Your calorie target alone should allow you to lose weight at a gradual, steady pace of about 0.5 kg 
(1 lb) per week, without feeling frustrated or deprived. 
Eating fewer than 1200 calories per day is not recommended. 
You will need to know your activity level to set your calorie targets. The more active you are, the 
higher your calorie target. 
- 
Low activity means you do little or no walking, climbing stairs, gardening, or other physical 
activity on a daily basis. 
Moderate activity means you burn around 150 calories per day in physical activity, for example, 
walking three kilometres (2 miles), gardening for 30 to 45 minutes, or running two kilometres 
(1.25 miles) in 15 minutes. Choose the level that most closely fits your daily routine. If you are 
unsure which level you are, choose Low activity.

How to set your fat target 
The following chart shows how to set your fat target based on the amount of calories you are allowed 
per day. You should plan to have three meals per day. If you have set a target of 1400 calories per day, 
for example, the maximum amount of fat allowed per meal would be 15 g. To stay within your daily 
allowance for fat, snacks should contain no more than 3 g of fat.

Stick to realistic calorie and fat targets as this is a good way of maintaining your weight loss 
achievements in the long-term. 
Write down what you eat in a food diary, including the calorie and fat content. 
Try to be more physically active before you start taking the capsules. Physical activity is an 
important part of a weight loss programme. Remember to check with your doctor first if you 
have not exercised before. 
Continue to be active while taking alli and after you stop taking it. 
The alli weight loss programme combines the capsules with an eating plan and a wide range of 
resources to help you understand how to eat a reduced calorie, lower-fat diet and guidelines for 
becoming more active.

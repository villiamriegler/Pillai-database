Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for radium-223 dichloride, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The MAH has provided an extensive review of the data from clinical trials and post-marketing settings 
regarding the possible role of Xofigo in dehydration. Although the data are not supportive of a direct causal 
correlation, the relationship between potential dehydration and prolonged bouts of vomiting and diarrhoea 
is well characterised. Based on this outcome, section 4.4 of the SmPC is updated with precautionary 
wording regarding the risk of dehydration. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC Rapporteur considered that 
changes to the product information of medicinal products containing Radium-223 dichloride were 
warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for radium-223 dichloride the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing radium-223 dichloride is unchanged subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This  application  concerns  a  generic  version  of  pemetrexed  100  mg  or  500  mg  powder  for  concentrate  for 
solution for infusion, Pemetrexed Baxter, which has the same active substance in comparable amounts to the 
centrally approved reference medicinal product Alimta (EU/1/04/290/001-002).  
Pemetrexed is an antifolate antineoplastic agent that works by inhibiting multiple enzymes involved in folate 
metabolism,  and  pyrimidine  and  purine  synthesis.  Pemetrexed  works  primarily  by  inhibiting  thymidylate 
synthase, but it also inhibits other folate-dependent enzymes: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycinamide 
ribonucleotide  formyltransferase  (GARFT).  By  inhibiting  the  biosynthesis  of  precursor  purine  and  pyrimidine 
nucleotides,  pemetrexed  prevents  the  formation  of  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA)  and  ribonucleic  acid  (RNA), 
which is required for the growth and survival of cancer cells.  
Pemetrexed Baxter has applied for all indications of the reference product Alimta (EU/1/04/290/001-002): 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Pemetrexed Baxter in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve patients 
with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Pemetrexed Baxter in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
Pemetrexed  Baxter  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  maintenance  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  other  than  predominantly  squamous  cell  histology  in  patients  whose 
disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Pemetrexed Baxter is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
Posology 
Pemetrexed Baxter must only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the use of 
anti-cancer chemotherapy. 
Pemetrexed Baxter in combination with cisplatin 
The recommended dose of Pemetrexed Baxter is 500 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) administered as an 
intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. The recommended dose of cisplatin 
is 75 mg/m2 BSA infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed infusion 
on the first day of each 21-day cycle. Patients must receive adequate anti-emetic treatment and appropriate 
hydration prior  to  and/or after  receiving  cisplatin  (see  also  cisplatin  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  for 
specific dosing advice).

Pemetrexed Baxter as single agent 
In patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of 
Pemetrexed Baxter is 500 mg/m2 BSA administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first 
day of each 21-day cycle. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 100 mg and 
500 mg of pemetrexed (as pemetrexed disodium) as active substance. 
Other ingredients are: mannitol, hydrochloric acid (pH adjustment), and sodium hydroxide (pH adjustment). 
The product is available in type I glass vial with chlorobutyl rubber stopper as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of active substance is disodium N-{p-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H- pyrrolo[2,3-
d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl}-L-glutamate heptahydrate corresponding to the molecular formula 
C20H19N5Na2O6‧7H2O. It has a relative molecular mass of 597.49 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
As there is a monograph of pemetrexed disodium in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the 
active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) which has 
been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Information on the elucidation of structure and other characteristics of the active substance provided by the 
CEP holder in the certification dossier has already been approved by the EDQM. 
The active substance is a slightly hygroscopic white or almost white powder very slightly soluble in water at pH 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251833/2022 
Page 9/10 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2 at 37°C; freely soluble in water at pH 4.5-8.0 at 37°C; freely soluble in water at 25°C and 37°C. 
The  active  substance  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  one  chiral  centre.  The  final  obtained 
active  substance  corresponds  to  (L)-pemetrexed  disodium.  The  chiral  impurity  (D)-pemetrexed  disodium  is 
controlled routinely in the active substance specification.  
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. The crystal form (heptahydrate form) is consistently 
produced by the manufacturing process. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  from  the  finished  product  manufacturer  includes  tests  for  appearance 
(visual), identification (IR, sodium, HPLC), colour of solution after reconstitution (Ph. Eur.), clarity of solution 
after  reconstitution  (Ph.  Eur.),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  enantiomeric  purity  (HPLC), 
water  content  (KF),  residual  solvents  (GC),  elemental  impurities  (ICP-OES),  microbial  enumeration  (TAMC, 
TCYMC) (Ph. Eur.), and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur).   
The acceptance criteria for impurities are based on Ph. Eur. Monograph. The acceptance criteria of specified 
impurities, any individual unspecified impurity and total impurities conform to ICH Q3A(R2), Impurities in New 
Drug  Substances,  and  are  based  on  data  generated  on  batches  of  the  pemetrexed  active  substance 
manufactured  by  the  proposed  commercial  process,  allowing  sufficient  latitude  to  deal  with  normal 
manufacturing and analytical variability and the stability characteristics of the active substance. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding the  reference  standards 
used for testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  (n=9)  commercial  scale  batches)  of  the  active  substance  are  provided.  The  results  are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. The control tests were carried out to comply with 
the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. monograph.  
Stability 
Pemetrexed stability is not covered by a CEP issued by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines 
and Healthcare (EDQM).  
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (30 ± 2°C/ 75 ± 5% RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. 
 The following parameters are tested: appearance, assay, impurities, water content, colour of solution, clarity 
of solution, bacterial endotoxins, TAMC and TCYMC. 
 All the results remained within specification for both long-term and accelerated conditions. 
A forced degradation study was performed to investigate the stability under stress conditions and to evaluate 
the suitability of the analytical testing methods of HPLC for assay and impurity as stability indicating methods 
(SIM). The stress conditions for solution stability include hydrolysis, oxidation under acidic and alkalic , and 
photostability. Results showed that the active substance is labile in hydrolytic and oxidative conditions, and

sensitive to photolytic condition. The results also indicated the HPLC methods for assay and impurity are capable 
of using as SIMs. 
A  solid  state  stability  study  was  also  performed.  The  objective  of  the  stress  study  was  to  investigate  the 
photolytic  and  thermal  stability  on  the  solid-state  in  order  to  establish  a  preliminary  storage  condition.  The 
stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as white to either light yellow or green-yellow lyophilized powder. 
The goal of the development studies was to develop a generic version of ALIMTA, the reference medicinal 
product.  
The finished product was developed using the QbD approach. A quality target product profile (QTPP) was 
established by reviewing compendial requirements, the properties of the active substance, and 
characterisation of the EU reference product. From the established QTPP the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) 
of the finished product were identified.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of  excipients  is  included  in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC of this report. 
Stability data demonstrate that the proposed finished product is chemically and physically stable under long-
term,  intermediate,  and  accelerated  storage;  therefore,  the  stability  data  supports  the  compatibility  of  the 
active substance with the excipients. 
The finished product is a single-use, sterile, lyophilised form. Formulation development is sufficiently described. 
The finished product is formulated to a target potency of 100% of label claim. The pemetrexed filling overage 
included to compensate vial and syringe retentions is suitable to allow withdrawal and delivery of the labeled 
dose.  
As the generic product contains the same amount and concentration of the same active substance, and concerns 
the  same  pharmaceutical  form  as  the  reference  medicinal  product  and  is  proposed  for  parenteral  use,  a 
bioequivalence study is not required. 
The  applicant  stated  that  the  presented  formulation  studies  support  the  pharmaceutical  equivalence  of  the 
generic product to the reference medicinal product. Comparability of test product with EU reference product 
was based on insufficient analytical data for quality critical attributes that did not allow for a definitive conclusion 
on  the  pharmaceutical  equivalence  of  the  proposed  medicinal  product  to  the  reference  medicinal  product. 
Therefore,  the  CHMP  requested  as  Major  Objection (MO)  that  additional  data demonstrating  pharmaceutical 
equivalence  of  the  generic  to  the  EU  reference  product  should  be  provided.  As  a  response,  the  applicant 
provided three new batches for each finished product strength to examine the pharmaceutical equivalence with 
the EU reference product. Results demonstrated physico-chemical similarity of both products for those tested 
parameters. The response was considered satisfactory.

The development of the manufacturing process was described. The rationale for a sterile filtration followed by 
an aseptic process has been satisfactorily discussed; the product is sensitive to terminal sterilisation methods.  
The  manufacturing  process  was  developed  to  minimise  oxidative  degradation  by  reducing  exposure  of 
pemetrexed  solution  to  oxygen..  The  lyophilisation  cycle  development  experiments  were  described,  and 
finalised  results  were  provided.  The  scale  up  to  validation  batches  was  also  described  and  considered 
satisfactory. 
According to the product information of the reference medicinal product, each 100 mg vial is reconstituted with 
4.2 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, and each 500 mg vial is reconstituted with 20 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride. 
An appropriate quantity of the reconstituted solution must be further diluted into a solution of 0.9% sodium 
chloride (preservative free), so that the total volume of solution is 100 mL. The reconstituted and further diluted 
finished product is stable for 24 hours from the time of reconstitution under refrigerated conditions (2-8 °C). 
A stability study of the generic medicinal product reconstituted solution was performed. The results showed 
that the impurity levels are comparable between reference medicinal product and the generic medicinal product 
when the vials are reconstituted with 0.9% sodium chloride and stored for 24 hours as recommended by the 
product information. 
The primary packaging is 10 mL or 50 mL colourless borosilicate type I glass vial with grey chlorobutyl rubber 
stopper . The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Container leachables 
were  evaluated  and  discussed  indicating  that  there  is  no  appreciable  risk  in  reconstituted  finished  product 
solution. The evaluation supports the use of the container closure system for the finished product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 7 main steps:  weighing and compounding, bioburden reducing filtration 
and sterile filtration, aseptic filling and semi-stoppering, lyophilization and capping, and packing. The process 
is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing  process  as  it  is  an  aseptic  process  by  sterile  filtration  in 
combination with a lyophilisation process. 
The  critical  process  parameters  (CPP),  process  parameters  (PP),  and  in-process  parameters  (IPC)  and  their 
control criteria have been specified and indicated according to each stage of production. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on 4 production scale 
batches per strength. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this 
type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identification (UV, HPLC), reconstitution testing (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC), 
water content (KF), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), 
sterility (Ph. Eur.), container closure sterility test (Ph. Eur.), injections and implanted finished products 
(Parenterals)-Product Quality Tests (Ph. Eur.)

The  finished  product  specifications  cover  appropriate  parameters  for  this  dosage  form  and  follows  general 
recommendations  provided  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  and  Specifications:  Test  Procedures  and  Acceptance 
Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances (CPMP/ICH/367/96); Note for 
Guidance on manufacture of the finished dosage form (CPMP/QWP/486/95); Impurities in new drug products 
(CPMP/ICH/2738/99)  and  the  European  Pharmacopoeia.  Acceptance  criteria  are  justified  based  on  ICH 
guidelines, requirements of pharmacopoeia, testing results of reference product and on batch analysis data of 
test product. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 batches using 
a  validated  ICP-MS  method  was  provided,  demonstrating  that  each  relevant  elemental  impurity  was  not 
detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can 
be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed  (as  requested)  considering  all  suspected  and  actual  root  causes  in  line  with  the  “Questions  and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities 
in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific 
control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used  for  testing  has  been 
presented. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  7  commercial  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 4 commercial scale batches per strength of the finished product stored for up to 18 months 
for the 100 mg strength and 24 months for the 500 mg strength under long term conditions (30°C ± 2°C / 
65%  ±  5%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40°C  ±  2°C / 75%  RH  ±  5%  RH) 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  Vials  were  stored  in  upright  and  inverted  orientations.  The 
stability batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packaged in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  reconstitution  time,  pH  after  reconstitution,  appearance  after 
reconstitution,  visible  particles  after  reconstitution,  sub-visible  particles  (particulate  matter)  after 
reconstitution, assay, impurities, water content, bacterial endotoxins, sterility, and container closure integrity. 
No significant changes have been observed under long term and accelerated stability conditions. During the

evaluation, the CHMP considered that oxygen content is a critical finished product quality attribute as test for 
oxygen is considered early indicative test with subsequent increase of impurities during storage, therefore, the 
CHMP recommended to incorporate a new specification parameter with an appropriate test method for oxygen 
content into the post-approval stability program [REC 001].  
In  addition,  one  batch  per  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability 
Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  All  results  met  the  acceptance  criteria  with  minimal  change 
observed for the light exposed vials, indicating the proposed drug product does not require protection from 
light. 
A thermal cycle study was conducted on one batch per strength of the finished product. All test results met the 
study’s acceptance criteria indicating the finished product can tolerate short-term exposures to temperatures 
ranging from -20°C to 60°C. 
The stability of the product after reconstitution with 0.9% sodium chloride to a concentration of 25 mg/ml, as 
described in the SmPC has been tested for 3 batches of each presentation. The reconstituted solution was found 
to be stable up to 24 hours when stored at 2 – 8°C. 
The stability/compatibility of the diluted product (ready for use) for concentration of 9 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml n 
polyolefin bags has been tested. The diluted solution was found to be stable and compatible with polyolefin 
bags up to 24 hours when stored at 2 – 8°C for concentration of 9 mg/ml. 
The CHMP recommended to perform in-use stability testing for diluted product at a concentration of 1 mg/mL 
for all essential quality parameters including appearance, visible and sub-visible particles for 100 mg batch 
and to repeat in-use stability study for diluted product at the end of shelf-life for both strengths and proposed 
concentrations (9 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml) in accordance with specifications [REC 003]. 
A  microbial  challenge  study  was  conducted  on  one  batch  of  each  strength.  The  results  confirm  the 
microbiological acceptability of the reconstituted product after 48 hours of refrigerated temperature storage. 
This study supports the label recommendation that reconstituted, preservative-free product should be stored 
under refrigerated conditions (2-8 °C) for no longer than 24 hours from the time of reconstitution. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months for the 100 mg unopen vials and 2 years 
for  the  500  mg  unopen  vials  without  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  (section  6.3  and  6.4)  are 
acceptable. 
For the reconstituted and infusion solutions, chemical and physical in-use stability of reconstituted and infusion 
solutions of pemetrexed were demonstrated for 24 hours at refrigerated (2 °C to 8 °C) temperature. From a 
microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage 
times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would not be longer than 24 hours at 
2°C to 8°C. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner.  
One MO had been raised about demonstrating pharmaceutical equivalence of the generic to the EU reference 
product,  which  was  resolved  by  provision  of  sufficient  additional  data.  Overall,  during  the  procedure,  the 
information of the dossier has been updated and improved as requested. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance 
in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on 
the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product which pertain to include oxygen testing with appropriate analytical method 
in the shelf-life specification of the finished product and stability protocol,  to perform in-use stability testing 
for  diluted  product  at  a  concentration  of  1mg/mL  essential  quality  parameters  including  appearance,  visible 
and sub-visible particles for 100 mg batch and to repeat in-use stability study for diluted product at the end of 
shelf-life  for  both  strengths  and  proposed  concentrations  (9  mg/ml  and  1  mg/ml)  in  accordance  with 
specifications. These points are put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality development. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- [REC 001] To include oxygen testing with appropriate analytical method in the shelf-life specification of the 
finished product and stability protocol.  
- [REC 002] To perform in-use stability testing for diluted product at a concentration of 1 mg/mL for all 
essential quality parameters including appearance, visible and sub-visible particles for 100 mg batch. 
- [REC 003] To repeat in-use stability study for diluted product at the end of shelf-life for both strengths and 
proposed concentrations (9 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml) in accordance with specifications.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251833/2022 
Page 15/16 
 
 
 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  studies  were  submitted.  This  was  justified  by  the  applicant  as  the 
introduction of Pemetrexed Baxter manufactured by Baxter Holding B.V. is considered unlikely to result in any 
significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all pemetrexed containing products and the exposure of 
the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  properties  of  pemetrexed  are  well  known.  The  non-
clinical overview is based on an up-to-date and adequate review of the relevant literature available in the public 
domain.  The  overview  justifies  why  there  is  no  need  to  generate  additional  non-clinical  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Based on the toxicological assessment of impurities, it can be concluded that related substances are not 
relevant.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
As per Environmental Risk Assessment Phase I (Pre-screening), PEC (Predicted Environmental Concentration) 
and logKow (octanol-water partition coefficient) values are below action limits, and further assessment is not 
deemed necessary. Pemetrexed Baxter is not predicted to increase the environmental risk. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing pemetrexed.  
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of pemetrexed based on published literature. The SmPC  is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For  the  clinical  assessment,  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1 in its current version is of particular relevance. 
Exemption  
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1 Corr **) 
for  parenteral  solutions,  “bioequivalence  studies  are  generally  not  required  if  the  test  product  is  to  be 
administered  as  an  aqueous  intravenous  solution  containing  the  same  active  substance  as  the  currently 
approved product. However, if any excipients interact with the drug substance (e.g. complex formation), or 
otherwise affect the disposition of the drug substance, a bioequivalence study is required unless both products 
contain the same excipients in very similar quantity and it can be adequately justified that any difference in 
quantity does not affect the pharmacokinetics of the active substance”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251833/2022 
Page 16/17 
 
 
 
The  active  substance  contained  in  Alimta  is  pemetrexed  disodium  heptahydrate,  and  the  active  substance 
contained in Pemetrexed Baxter is also pemetrexed disodium heptahydrate, i.e., the composition is qualitatively 
and quantitatively the same.  
The Applicant has provided information that the excipients contained in the proposed formulation are the same 
and in the same quantity as the ones contained in the reference product formulation. 
Alimta and Pemetrexed Baxter are medicinal products for parenteral administration as an aqueous intravenous 
solution and as such are anticipated to be immediately bioavailable. 
Furthermore, none of the excipients interact with the drug substance (e.g., complex formation); none of the 
excipients affect the disposition of the drug substance. 
2.4.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic studies were conducted however pharmacokinetic data from scientific publications 
were presented. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis by Latz et al. (2006), presented by the applicant, data on 287 patients 
(441 cycles collectively) from 10 phase II clinical trials of pemetrexed in cancer patients was evaluated using 
NONMEM. The patients were dosed based on BSA and were initially assigned to receive a 10-minute IV infusion 
of  500  or  600  mg/m2  of  pemetrexed  every  21  days  (without  folic  acid  or  vitamin  B12  supplementation).  A 
population pharmacokinetic model was developed using an index dataset from 8 of the 10 studies and predictive 
performance  was  evaluated  using  data  from  the  other  2  studies.  This  analysis  showed  that  pemetrexed 
demonstrated a relatively small volume of distribution (Vss=16.3), suggesting that the compound has limited 
tissue distribution. 
Ouellet  et  al.  (2000)  found  that  the  typical  value  for  clearance  is  dependent  on  the  body  weight,  alanine 
transferase, clearance of creatinine and folate deficiency. 
A phase I study by Mita et al., (2006) was conducted to assess the impact of renal dysfunction in 47 patients 
with solid tumours. The patients received a 10-minute infusion of 150 to 600 mg/m2 of pemetrexed every 21 
days  and  during  the  first  cycle,  plasma  and  urine  pharmacokinetics  were  evaluated.  Pemetrexed  plasma 
clearance positively correlated with glomerular filtration rate, resulting in increased drug exposure in patients 
with impaired renal function. This was also evident in the population pharmacokinetic analysis by Latz et al. 
(2006) where by the range of systemic clearance estimates that represents approximately 95% of all patients 
in the study population (i.e., population pharmacokinetic evaluations on 287 patients) was 53.2 to 146 mL/min. 
These results suggest, according to the authors, that dose adjustments based on renal function, rather than 
BSA, might be considered for pemetrexed. 
A later pharmacokinetic analysis by de Rouw et al. (2021) on pemetrexed in a population that included patients 
with impaired renal function on (i.e., 47 patients, with a total of 548 paired observations of time and plasma 
concentrations after pemetrexed administration) found that renal clearance accounts for up to 84% of total 
pemetrexed clearance.

2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.2.3.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
No studies have been conducted and presented by the applicant. The justification for waiving bioequivalence 
studies is acceptable from the clinical point of view.  
The application contains an adequate review of published clinical data concerning the clinical use of pemetrexed 
for the proposed indications.  
Pemetrexed has been in use as an anticancer medication for more than 10 years and the safety profile and 
tolerability of the medicinal product have become well established.  
All  data  regarding  safety  and  efficacy  available  for  the  reference  medicinal  product  also  apply  for  this 
application.  
Clinical parts of the proposed Summary of Product Characteristics are in line with those of reference product 
Alimta. 
The Clinical overview on the efficacy and safety is considered adequate. The Applicant has complemented the 
clinical  pharmacology  section  of  the  Clinical  Overview  with  new  pharmacokinetic  data  from  the  scientific 
publications.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Pemetrexed Baxter and justifications that the active 
substance does not differ significantly, in properties with regard to safety and efficacy, of the reference product 
was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional 
clinical studies were not considered necessary.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of pemetrexed 100 and 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution 
for infusion. The reference product Alimta is indicated for: 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Alimta in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve patients with 
unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Alimta in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
Alimta is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients whose disease has not 
progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Alimta is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The pharmaceutical equivalence has been demonstrated and the justification for waiving bioequivalence studies 
is acceptable.  
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen  reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.  
4.  Recommendations

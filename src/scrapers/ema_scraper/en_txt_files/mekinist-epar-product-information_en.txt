CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Melanoma 
Trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Trametinib monotherapy has not demonstrated clinical activity in patients who have progressed on a 
prior BRAF inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1). 
Adjuvant treatment of melanoma 
Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients 
with Stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection. 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a BRAF V600 mutation.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with trametinib should only be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the 
administration of anti-cancer medicinal products. 
Before taking trametinib, patients must have confirmation of BRAF V600 mutation using a validated 
test. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of trametinib, either used as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib, 
is 2 mg once daily. The recommended dose of dabrafenib, when used in combination with trametinib, 
is 150 mg twice daily. 
Duration of treatment 
It is recommended that patients continue treatment with trametinib until patients no longer derive 
benefit or the development of unacceptable toxicity (see Table 2). In the adjuvant melanoma setting, 
patients should be treated for a period of 12 months unless there is disease recurrence or unacceptable 
toxicity. 
Missed doses 
If a dose of trametinib is missed, it should only be taken if it is more than 12 hours until the next 
scheduled dose. 
If a dose of dabrafenib is missed, when trametinib is given in combination with dabrafenib, the dose of 
dabrafenib should only be taken if it is more than 6 hours until the next scheduled dose. 
Dose modification 
The management of adverse reactions may require dose reduction, treatment interruption or treatment 
discontinuation (see Tables 1 and 2). 
Dose modifications are not recommended for adverse reactions of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma 
(cuSCC) or new primary melanoma (see dabrafenib SmPC for further details).

Recommended trametinib dose modifications 
Used as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib 
Continue treatment and monitor as clinically indicated. 
Interrupt therapy until toxicity is Grade 0 to 1 and reduce by one dose 
level when resuming therapy. 
Discontinue permanently, or interrupt therapy until Grade 0 to 1 and 
reduce by one dose level when resuming therapy. 
* The intensity of clinical adverse reactions graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v4.0 (CTC-AE) 
When an individual’s adverse reactions are under effective management, dose re-escalation following 
the same dosing steps as de-escalation may be considered. The trametinib dose should not exceed 
2 mg once daily. 
Pyrexia 
If a patient’s temperature is ≥38oC, therapy should be interrupted (trametinib when used as 
monotherapy, and both trametinib and dabrafenib when used in combination). In case of recurrence, 
therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia. Treatment with anti-pyretics such as 
ibuprofen or acetaminophen/paracetamol should be initiated. The use of oral corticosteroids should be 
considered in those instances in which anti-pyretics are insufficient. Patients should be evaluated for 
signs and symptoms of infection and if necessary treated in line with local practice (see section 4.4). 
Trametinib, or both trametinib and dabrafenib when used in combination, should be restarted if the 
patient is symptom free for at least 24 hours either (1) at the same dose level, or (2) reduced by one 
dose level, if pyrexia is recurrent and/or was accompanied by other severe symptoms including 
dehydration, hypotension or renal failure. 
If treatment-related toxicities occur when trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib, then both 
treatments should be simultaneously dose reduced, interrupted or discontinued. Exceptions where dose 
modifications are necessary for only one of the two treatments are detailed below for uveitis, RAS 
mutation positive non-cutaneous malignancies (primarily related to dabrafenib), left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), retinal pigment epithelial 
detachment (RPED) and interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis (primarily related to trametinib). 
Dose modification exceptions (where only one of the two therapies is dose reduced) for selected 
adverse reactions 
Uveitis 
No dose modifications are required for uveitis as long as effective local therapies can control ocular 
inflammation. If uveitis does not respond to local ocular therapy, dabrafenib should be withheld until 
resolution of ocular inflammation and then dabrafenib should be restarted reduced by one dose level. 
No dose modification of trametinib is required when taken in combination with dabrafenib (see 
section 4.4). 
RAS-mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies 
The benefits and risks must be considered before continuing treatment with dabrafenib in patients with 
a non-cutaneous malignancy that has a RAS mutation. No dose modification of trametinib is required 
when taken in combination with dabrafenib. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction/Left ventricular dysfunction 
Trametinib should be interrupted in patients who have an asymptomatic, absolute decrease of >10% in 
LVEF compared to baseline and the ejection fraction is below the institution’s lower limit of normal 
(LLN) (see section 4.4). No dose modification of dabrafenib is required when trametinib is taken in 
combination with dabrafenib. If the LVEF recovers, treatment with trametinib may be restarted, but 
the dose should be reduced by one dose level with careful monitoring (see section 4.4). 
Trametinib should be permanently discontinued in patients with Grade 3 or 4 left ventricular cardiac 
dysfunction or clinically significant LVEF reduction which does not recover within 4 weeks (see 
section 4.4). 
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) 
If patients report new visual disturbances such as diminished central vision, blurred vision, or loss of 
vision at any time while on trametinib therapy, a prompt ophthalmological assessment is 
recommended. In patients who are diagnosed with RVO, treatment with trametinib, whether given as 
monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib, should be permanently discontinued. No dose 
modification of dabrafenib is required when trametinib is taken in combination with dabrafenib. If 
RPED is diagnosed, follow the dose modification schedule in Table 3 below for trametinib (see 
section 4.4). 
Table 3 
Recommended dose modifications for trametinib for RPED 
Grade 1 RPED 
Grade 2-3 RPED 
Grade 2-3 RPED that improves to 
Grade 0-1 within 3 weeks 
Grade 2-3 RPED that does not improve 
to at least Grade 1 within 3 weeks 
Continue treatment with retinal evaluation monthly until 
resolution. If RPED worsens follow instructions below 
and withhold trametinib for up to 3 weeks. 
Withhold trametinib for up to 3 weeks. 
Resume trametinib at a lower dose (reduced by 0.5 mg) 
or discontinue trametinib in patients taking trametinib 
1 mg daily. 
Permanently discontinue trametinib. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis 
Trametinib must be withheld in patients with suspected ILD or pneumonitis, including patients 
presenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings including cough, dyspnoea, 
hypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. Trametinib must be 
permanently discontinued in patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis. No dose 
modification of dabrafenib is required when trametinib is taken in combination with dabrafenib for 
cases of ILD or pneumonitis. 
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
There are no data with trametinib in patients with severe renal impairment; therefore, the potential 
need for starting dose adjustment cannot be determined. Trametinib should be used with caution in 
patients with severe renal impairment when administered as monotherapy or in combination with 
dabrafenib. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Available data from a 
clinical pharmacology study indicate a limited impact of moderate to severe hepatic impairment on 
trametinib exposure (see section 5.2). Trametinib should be used with caution in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment when administered as monotherapy or in combination with 
dabrafenib.

Non-Caucasian patients 
The safety and efficacy of trametinib in non-Caucasian patients have not been established. No data are 
available. 
Elderly 
No initial dose adjustment is required in patients >65 years of age. More frequent dose adjustments 
(see Tables 1 and 2 above) may be required in patients >65 years of age (see section 4.8). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of trametinib in children and adolescents (<18 years) have not been 
established. No data are available. Studies in juvenile animals have shown adverse effects of 
trametinib which were not observed in adult animals (see section 5.3). 
Method of administration 
Trametinib should be taken orally with a full glass of water. The tablets should not be chewed or 
crushed and they should be taken without food, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. 
It is recommended that the dose of trametinib is taken at a similar time every day. When trametinib 
and dabrafenib are taken in combination, the once-daily dose of trametinib should be taken at the same 
time each day with either the morning dose or the evening dose of dabrafenib. 
If a patient vomits after taking trametinib, the patient should not retake the dose and should take the 
next scheduled dose. 
Please refer to dabrafenib SmPC for information on method of administration when given in 
combination with trametinib. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
When trametinib is given in combination with dabrafenib, the SmPC of dabrafenib must be consulted 
prior to initiation of treatment. For additional information on warnings and precautions associated with 
dabrafenib treatment, please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC. 
BRAF V600 testing 
The efficacy and safety of trametinib have not been evaluated in patients whose melanoma tested 
negative for the BRAF V600 mutation. 
Trametinib monotherapy compared to BRAF inhibitors 
Trametinib monotherapy has not been compared with a BRAF inhibitor in a clinical study in patients 
with BRAF V600 mutation positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Based on cross-study 
comparisons, overall survival and progression-free survival data appear to show similar effectiveness 
between trametinib and BRAF inhibitors; however, overall response rates were lower in patients 
treated with trametinib than those reported in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors.

Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in patients with melanoma who have progressed on a 
BRAF inhibitor 
There are limited data in patients taking the combination of trametinib with dabrafenib who have 
progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor. These data show that the efficacy of the combination will be 
lower in these patients (see section 5.1). Therefore other treatment options should be considered before 
treatment with the combination in this prior BRAF inhibitor treated population. The sequencing of 
treatments following progression on a BRAF inhibitor therapy has not been established. 
New malignancies 
New malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when trametinib is used in combination 
with dabrafenib. 
Cutaneous malignancies 
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) 
Cases of cuSCC (including keratoacanthoma) have been reported in patients treated with trametinib in 
combination with dabrafenib. Cases of cuSCC can be managed with excision and do not require 
treatment modification. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). 
New primary melanoma 
New primary melanoma was reported in patients receiving trametinib in combination with dabrafenib. 
Cases of new primary melanoma can be managed with excision and do not require treatment 
modification. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). 
Non-cutaneous malignancies 
Based on its mechanism of action, dabrafenib may increase the risk of non-cutaneous malignancies 
when RAS mutations are present. When trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib please refer 
to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). No dose modification of trametinib is required for RAS 
mutation positive malignancies when taken in combination with dabrafenib. 
Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhagic events, including major haemorrhagic events and fatal haemorrhages, have occurred in 
patients taking trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). The 
potential for these events in patients with low platelet counts (<75,000) has not been established as 
such patients were excluded from clinical trials. The risk of haemorrhage may be increased with 
concomitant use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. If haemorrhage occurs, patients should be 
treated as clinically indicated. 
LVEF reduction/Left ventricular dysfunction 
Trametinib has been reported to decrease LVEF, when used as monotherapy or in combination with 
dabrafenib (see section 4.8). In clinical trials, the median time to onset of the first occurrence of left 
ventricular dysfunction, cardiac failure and LVEF decrease was between 2 and 5 months. 
Trametinib should be used with caution in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Patients 
with left ventricular dysfunction, New York Heart Association Class II, III, or IV heart failure, acute 
coronary syndrome within the past 6 months, clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, and 
uncontrolled hypertension were excluded from clinical trials; safety of use in this population is 
therefore unknown. LVEF should be evaluated in all patients prior to initiation of treatment with 
trametinib, one month after initiation of therapy, and then at approximately 3-monthly intervals while 
on treatment (see section 4.2 regarding dose modification). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients receiving trametinib in combination with dabrafenib, there have been occasional reports of 
acute, severe left ventricular dysfunction due to myocarditis. Full recovery was observed when 
stopping treatment. Physicians should be alert to the possibility of myocarditis in patients who develop 
new or worsening cardiac signs or symptoms. 
Pyrexia 
Fever has been reported in clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with 
dabrafenib (see section 4.8). The incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with the combination 
therapy (see dabrafenib SmPC section 4.4). In patients receiving trametinib in combination with 
dabrafenib, pyrexia may be accompanied by severe rigors, dehydration, and hypotension which in 
some cases can lead to acute renal insufficiency. 
Therapy (trametinib when used as monotherapy, and both trametinib and dabrafenib when used in 
combination) should be interrupted if the patient’s temperature is ≥38ºC (see section 5.1). In case of 
recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia. Treatment with 
anti-pyretics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen/paracetamol should be initiated. The use of oral 
corticosteroids should be considered in those instances in which anti-pyretics are insufficient. Patients 
should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of infection. Therapy can be restarted once the fever 
resolves. If fever is associated with other severe signs or symptoms, therapy should be restarted at a 
reduced dose once fever resolves and as clinically appropriate (see section 4.2). 
Hypertension 
Elevations in blood pressure have been reported in association with trametinib as monotherapy and in 
combination with dabrafenib, in patients with or without pre-existing hypertension (see section 4.8). 
Blood pressure should be measured at baseline and monitored during treatment with trametinib, with 
control of hypertension by standard therapy as appropriate. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis 
In a Phase III trial, 2.4% (5/211) of patients treated with trametinib monotherapy developed ILD or 
pneumonitis; all five patients required hospitalisation. The median time to first presentation of ILD or 
pneumonitis was 160 days (range: 60 to 172 days). In studies MEK115306 and MEK116513 <1% 
(2/209) and 1 % (4/350), respectively, of patients treated with trametinib in combination with 
dabrafenib developed pneumonitis or ILD (see section 4.8). 
Trametinib should be withheld in patients with suspected ILD or pneumonitis, including patients 
presenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings including cough, dyspnoea, 
hypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. Trametinib should be 
permanently discontinued for patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis (see 
section 4.2). If trametinib is being used in combination with dabrafenib then therapy with dabrafenib 
may be continued at the same dose. 
Visual impairment 
Disorders associated with visual disturbance, including RPED and RVO, may occur with trametinib as 
monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib. Symptoms such as blurred vision, decreased acuity, 
and other visual phenomena have been reported in the clinical trials with trametinib (see section 4.8). 
In clinical trials uveitis and iridocyclitis have also been reported in patients treated with trametinib in 
combination with dabrafenib. 
Trametinib is not recommended in patients with a history of RVO. The safety of trametinib in subjects 
with predisposing factors for RVO, including uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, 
uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or a history of hyperviscosity or 
hypercoagulability syndromes, has not been established. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If patients report new visual disturbances, such as diminished central vision, blurred vision or loss of 
vision at any time while on trametinib therapy, a prompt ophthalmological assessment is 
recommended. If RPED is diagnosed, the dose modification schedule in Table 3 should be followed 
(see section 4.2); if uveitis is diagnosed, please refer to dabrafenib SmPC section 4.4. In patients who 
are diagnosed with RVO, treatment with trametinib should be permanently discontinued. No dose 
modification of dabrafenib is required when taken in combination with trametinib following diagnosis 
of RVO or RPED. No dose modification of trametinib is required when taken in combination with 
dabrafenib following diagnosis of uveitis. 
Rash 
Rash has been observed in about 60% of patients in trametinib monotherapy studies and in about 24% 
of patients when trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). The majority of 
these cases were Grade 1 or 2 and did not require any dose interruptions or dose reductions. 
Rhabdomyolysis 
Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients taking trametinib as monotherapy or in combination 
with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). In some cases, patients were able to continue trametinib. In more 
severe cases hospitalisation, interruption or permanent discontinuation of trametinib or trametinib and 
dabrafenib combination was required. Signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis should warrant an 
appropriate clinical evaluation and treatment as indicated. 
Renal failure 
Renal failure has been identified in patients treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in 
clinical trials. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). 
Pancreatitis 
Pancreatitis has been reported in patients treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in 
clinical trials. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). 
Hepatic events 
Hepatic adverse  reactions have been reported in clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy and in 
combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). It is recommended that patients receiving treatment 
with trametinib monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib have liver function monitored every 
four weeks for 6 months after treatment initiation with trametinib. Liver monitoring may be continued 
thereafter as clinically indicated. 
Hepatic impairment 
As metabolism and biliary excretion are the primary routes of elimination of trametinib, administration 
of trametinib should be undertaken with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE) 
Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis can occur when trametinib is used as monotherapy or in 
combination with dabrafenib. If patients develop symptoms of pulmonary embolism or deep vein 
thrombosis such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling, they should immediately 
seek medical care. Permanently discontinue trametinib and dabrafenib for life-threatening pulmonary 
embolism. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions 
Cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and drug 
reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, 
have been reported during treatment with dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Before initiating 
treatment, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin 
reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of SCARs appear, dabrafenib and trametinib should be 
withdrawn. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Colitis and gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal outcome, have been reported in patients taking 
trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). Treatment with 
trametinib monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib should be used with caution in patients 
with risk factors for gastrointestinal perforation, including history of diverticulitis, metastases to the 
gastrointestinal tract and concomitant use of medicinal products with a recognised risk of 
gastrointestinal perforation. 
Sarcoidosis 
Cases of sarcoidosis have been reported in patients treated with trametinib in combination with 
dabrafenib, mostly involving the skin, lung, eye and lymph nodes. In the majority of the cases, 
treatment with trametinib and dabrafenib was maintained. In case of a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, 
relevant treatment should be considered. It is important not to misinterpret sarcoidosis as disease 
progression. 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
In post-marketing experience, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been observed in 
patients treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib. Caution should be taken when 
trametinib is administered in combination with dabrafenib. If HLH is confirmed, administration of 
trametinib and dabrafenib should be discontinued and treatment for HLH initiated. 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on trametinib 
As trametinib is metabolised predominantly via deacetylation mediated by hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. 
carboxyl-esterases), its pharmacokinetics are unlikely to be affected by other agents through metabolic 
interactions (see section 5.2). Drug-drug interactions via these hydrolytic enzymes cannot be ruled out 
and could influence the exposure to trametinib. 
Trametinib is an in vitro substrate of the efflux transporter P-gp. As it cannot be excluded that strong 
inhibition of hepatic P-gp may result in increased levels of trametinib, caution is advised when 
co-administering trametinib with medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of P-gp (e.g. verapamil, 
cyclosporine, ritonavir, quinidine, itraconazole). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of trametinib on other medicinal products 
Based on in vitro and in vivo data, trametinib is unlikely to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of 
other medicinal products via interaction with CYP enzymes or transporters (see section 5.2). 
Trametinib may result in transient inhibition of BCRP substrates (e.g. pitavastatin) in the gut, which 
may be minimised with staggered dosing (2 hours apart) of these agents and trametinib. 
Based on clinical data, no loss of efficacy of hormonal contraceptives is expected when 
co-administered with trametinib monotherapy (see section 5.2). 
Combination with dabrafenib 
When trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib see sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the dabrafenib 
SmPC for interactions. 
Effect of food on trametinib 
Patients should take trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib at least one hour 
prior to or two hours after a meal due to the effect of food on trametinib absorption (see section 4.2 
and 5.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females 
Female patients of reproductive potential must be advised to use effective methods of contraception 
during treatment with trametinib and for 16 weeks after stopping treatment. 
Use with dabrafenib may render hormonal contraceptives less effective and therefore an alternative 
method of contraception, such as a barrier method, should be used when trametinib is used in 
combination with dabrafenib. Refer to the dabrafenib SmPC for further information. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of trametinib in pregnant women. Animal studies 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Trametinib should not be administered to pregnant 
women. If trametinib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking 
trametinib, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether trametinib is excreted in human milk. Because many medicinal products are 
excreted in human milk, a risk to the breast-feeding infant cannot be excluded. Trametinib should not 
be administered to breast-feeding mothers. A decision should be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or discontinue trametinib, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child 
and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data in humans for trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib. In 
animals, no fertility studies have been performed, but adverse effects were seen on female 
reproductive organs (see section 5.3). Trametinib may impair fertility in humans.

Men taking trametinib in combination with dabrafenib 
Effects on spermatogenesis have been observed in animals given dabrafenib. Male patients taking 
trametinib in combination with dabrafenib should be informed of the potential risk for impaired 
spermatogenesis, which may be irreversible. Refer to the dabrafenib SmPC for further information. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Trametinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The clinical status of the 
patient and the adverse reaction profile should be borne in mind when considering the patient’s ability 
to perform tasks that require judgement, motor and cognitive skills. Patients should be made aware of 
potential for fatigue, dizziness or eye problems that might affect these activities. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of trametinib monotherapy has been evaluated in the integrated safety population of 
329 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma treated with trametinib 
2 mg once daily in studies MEK114267, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Of these patients, 211 were 
treated with trametinib for BRAF V600 mutant melanoma in the randomised open-label Phase III 
study MEK114267 (METRIC) (see section 5.1). The most common adverse reactions (incidence 
≥20%) for trametinib were rash, diarrhoea, fatigue, oedema peripheral, nausea, and dermatitis 
acneiform. 
The safety of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib has been evaluated in the integrated safety 
population of 1,076 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma, Stage III 
BRAF V600 mutant melanoma following complete resection (adjuvant treatment) and advanced 
NSCLC treated with trametinib 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. Of these patients, 
559 were treated with the combination for BRAF V600 mutant melanoma in two randomised Phase III 
studies, MEK115306 (COMBI-d) and MEK116513 (COMBI-v), 435 were treated with the 
combination in the adjuvant treatment of Stage III BRAF V600 mutant melanoma after complete 
resection in a randomised Phase III study BRF115532 (COMBI-AD) and 82 were treated with the 
combination for BRAF V600 mutant NSCLC in a multi-cohort, non-randomised Phase II study 
BRF113928 (see section 5.1). 
The most common adverse reactions (incidence 20%) for trametinib in combination with dabrafenib 
were: pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, chills, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, arthralgia and rash.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
New malignancies 
New malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when trametinib is used in combination 
with dabrafenib. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC. 
Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhagic events, including major haemorrhagic events and fatal haemorrhages, occurred in 
patients taking trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib. The majority of 
bleeding events were mild. Fatal intracranial haemorrhages occurred in the integrated safety 
population of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in <1% (8/1076) of patients. The median time 
to onset of the first occurrence of haemorrhagic events for the combination of trametinib and 
dabrafenib was 94 days in the melanoma Phase III studies and 75 days in the NSCLC study for the 
patients who had received prior anti-cancer therapy. 
The risk of haemorrhage may be increased with concomitant use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant 
therapy. If haemorrhage occurs, treat as clinically indicated (see section 4.4). 
LVEF reduction/Left ventricular dysfunction 
Trametinib has been reported to decrease LVEF when used as monotherapy or in combination with 
dabrafenib. In clinical trials, the median time to first occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac 
failure and LVEF decrease was between 2 to 5 months. In the integrated safety population of 
trametinib in combination with dabrafenib, decreased LVEF has been reported in 6% (65/1076) of 
patients, with most cases being asymptomatic and reversible. Patients with LVEF lower than the 
institutional lower limit of normal were not included in clinical trials with trametinib. Trametinib 
should be used with caution in patients with conditions that could impair left ventricular function (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pyrexia 
Pyrexia has been reported in clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with 
dabrafenib; however, the incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with the combination 
therapy. Please refer to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the dabrafenib SmPC. 
Hepatic events 
Hepatic adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy and in 
combination with dabrafenib. Of the hepatic adverse reactions, increased ALT and AST were the most 
common events and the majority were either Grade 1 or 2. For trametinib monotherapy, more than 
90% of these liver events occurred within the first 6 months of treatment. Liver events were detected 
in clinical trials with monitoring every four weeks. It is recommended that patients receiving treatment 
with trametinib monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib have liver function monitored every 
four weeks for 6 months. Liver monitoring may be continued thereafter as clinically indicated (see 
section 4.4). 
Hypertension 
Elevations in blood pressure have been reported in association with trametinib as monotherapy and in 
combination with dabrafenib, in patients with or without pre-existing hypertension. Blood pressure 
should be measured at baseline and monitored during treatment, with control of hypertension by 
standard therapy as appropriate (see section 4.4). 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis 
Patients treated with trametinib or combination with dabrafenib may develop ILD or pneumonitis. 
Trametinib should be withheld in patients with suspected ILD or pneumonitis, including patients 
presenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings including cough, dyspnoea, 
hypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. For patients diagnosed with 
treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis trametinib should be permanently discontinued (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4). 
Visual impairment 
Disorders associated with visual disturbances, including RPED and RVO, have been observed with 
trametinib. Symptoms such as blurred vision, decreased acuity, and other visual disturbances have 
been reported in the clinical trials with trametinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Rash 
Rash has been observed in about 60% of patients when given as monotherapy and in about 24% of 
patients in trametinib and dabrafenib combination studies in the integrated safety population. The 
majority of these cases were Grade 1 or 2 and did not require any dose interruptions or dose reductions 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Rhabdomyolysis 
Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients taking trametinib alone or in combination with 
dabrafenib. Signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis should warrant an appropriate clinical evaluation 
and treatment as indicated (see section 4.4). 
Pancreatitis 
Pancreatitis has been reported with dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Please see the 
dabrafenib SmPC.

Renal failure has been reported with dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Please see the 
dabrafenib SmPC. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
In the Phase III study with trametinib in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma (n=211), 
49 patients (23%) were ≥65 years of age, and 9 patients (4%) were ≥75 years of age. The proportion of 
subjects experiencing adverse reactions (AR) and serious adverse reactions (SAR) was similar in the 
subjects aged <65 years and those aged ≥65 years. Patients ≥65 years were more likely to experience 
ARs leading to permanent discontinuation of medicinal product, dose reduction and dose interruption 
than those <65 years. 
In the integrated safety population of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib (n=1,076) 
265 patients (25%) were ≥65 years of age; 62 patients (6%) were ≥75 years of age. The proportion of 
patients experiencing ARs was similar in those aged <65 years and those aged ≥65 years in all studies. 
Patients ≥65 years were more likely to experience SARs and ARs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of medicinal product, dose reduction and dose interruption than those <65 years. 
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Trametinib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Trametinib should be used with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in patients with brain metastases 
The safety and efficacy of the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib have been evaluated in a 
multi-cohort, open-label, Phase II study in patients with BRAF V600 mutant melanoma with brain 
metastases. The safety profile observed in these patients appears to be consistent with the integrated 
safety profile of the combination. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical trials with trametinib monotherapy one case of accidental overdose was reported; a single 
dose of 4 mg. No AEs were reported following this event of trametinib overdose. In clinical trials with 
the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib 11 patients reported trametinib overdose (4 mg); no 
SAEs were reported. There is no specific treatment for overdose. If overdose occurs, the patient should 
be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor, Mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MEK) inhibitors, ATC code: L01EE01 
Mechanism of action 
Trametinib is a reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular 
signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and kinase activity. MEK proteins are 
components of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. In melanoma and other cancers, 
this pathway is often activated by mutated forms of BRAF which activates MEK. Trametinib inhibits 
activation of MEK by BRAF and inhibits MEK kinase activity. Trametinib inhibits growth of BRAF 
V600 mutant melanoma cell lines and demonstrates anti-tumour effects in BRAF V600 mutant 
melanoma animal models. 
Combination with dabrafenib 
Dabrafenib is an inhibitor of RAF kinases. Oncogenic mutations in BRAF lead to constitutive 
activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Thus, trametinib and dabrafenib inhibit two kinases 
in this pathway, MEK and RAF, and therefore the combination provides concomitant inhibition of the 
pathway. The combination of trametinib with dabrafenib has shown anti-tumour activity in BRAF 
V600 mutation positive melanoma cell lines in vitro and delays the emergence of resistance in vivo in 
BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma xenografts. 
Determination of BRAF mutation status 
Before taking trametinib or the combination with dabrafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 
mutation-positive tumour status confirmed by a validated test. 
In clinical trials, central testing for BRAF V600 mutation using a BRAF mutation assay was 
conducted on the most recent tumour sample available. Primary tumour or tumour from a metastatic 
site was tested with a validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay developed by Response 
Genetics Inc. The assay was specifically designed to differentiate between the V600E and V600K 
mutations. Only patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation positive tumours were eligible for 
study participation. 
Subsequently, all patient samples were re-tested using the CE-marked bioMerieux (bMx) THxID 
BRAF validated assay. The bMx THxID BRAF assay is an allele-specific PCR performed on DNA 
extracted from FFPE tumour tissue. The assay was designed to detect the BRAF V600E and V600K 
mutations with high sensitivity (down to 5% V600E and V600K sequence in a background of 
wild-type sequence using DNA extracted from FFPE tissue). Non-clinical and clinical trials with 
retrospective bi-directional Sanger sequencing analyses have shown that the test also detects the less 
common BRAF V600D mutation and V600E/K601E mutation with lower sensitivity. Of the 
specimens from the non-clinical and clinical trials (n=876) that were mutation positive by the THxID 
BRAF assay and subsequently were sequenced using the reference method, the specificity of the assay 
was 94%. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Trametinib suppressed levels of phosphorylated ERK in BRAF mutant melanoma tumour cell lines 
and melanoma xenograft models. 
In patients with BRAF and NRAS mutation positive melanoma, administration of trametinib resulted 
in dose-dependent changes in tumour biomarkers including inhibition of phosphorylated ERK, 
inhibition of Ki67 (a marker of cell proliferation), and increases in p27 (a marker of apoptosis). The 
mean trametinib concentrations observed following repeat dose administration of 2 mg once daily 
exceeds the preclinical target concentration over the 24-hr dosing interval, thereby providing sustained 
inhibition of the MEK pathway. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
In the clinical trials only patients with cutaneous melanoma were studied. Efficacy in patients with 
ocular or mucosal melanoma has not been assessed. 
• 
Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib 
Treatment naïve patients 
The efficacy and safety of the recommended dose of trametinib (2 mg once daily) in combination with 
dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation was studied in two Phase III studies and one supportive 
Phase I/II study. 
MEK115306 (COMBI-d): 
MEK115306 was a Phase III, randomised, double-blinded study comparing the combination of 
dabrafenib and trametinib to dabrafenib and placebo in first-line therapy for subjects with unresectable 
(Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. The 
primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS), with a key secondary endpoint of 
overall survival (OS). Subjects were stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> the upper limit 
of normal (ULN) versus ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E versus V600K). 
A total of 423 subjects were randomised 1:1 to either combination (N=211) or dabrafenib (N=212). 
Most subjects were Caucasian (>99%) and male (53%), with a median age of 56 years (28% were 
≥65 years). The majority of subjects had Stage IVM1c disease (67%). Most subjects had LDH ≤ULN 
(65%), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (72%), and visceral 
disease (73%) at baseline. The majority of subjects had a BRAF V600E mutation (85%). Subjects with 
brain metastases were not included in the trial. 
Median OS and estimated 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year and 5-year survival rates are presented in 
Table 6. From an OS analysis at 5 years, the median OS for the combination arm was approximately 
7 months longer than for dabrafenib monotherapy (25.8 months versus 18.7 months) with 5-year 
survival rates of 32% for the combination versus 27% for dabrafenib monotherapy (Table 6, Figure 1). 
The Kaplan-Meier OS curve appears to stabilise from 3 to 5 years (see Figure 1). The 5-year overall 
survival rate was 40% (95% CI: 31.2, 48.4) in the combination arm versus 33% (95% CI: 25.0, 41.0) 
in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm for patients who had a normal lactate dehydrogenase level at 
baseline, and 16% (95% CI: 8.4, 26.0) in the combination arm versus 14% (95% CI: 6.8, 23.1) in the 
dabrafenib monotherapy arm for patients with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level at baseline.

Improvements for the primary endpoint of PFS were sustained over a 5 year timeframe in the 
combination arm compared to dabrafenib monotherapy. Improvements were also observed for overall 
response rate (ORR) and a longer duration of response (DoR) was observed in the combination arm 
compared to dabrafenib monotherapy (Table 7).

MEK116513 (COMBI-v): 
Study MEK116513 was a 2-arm, randomised, open-label, Phase III study comparing dabrafenib and 
trametinib combination therapy with vemurafenib monotherapy in BRAF V600 mutation-positive 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The primary endpoint of the study was OS with a key secondary 
endpoint of PFS. Subjects were stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> the upper limit of 
normal (ULN) versus ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E versus V600K). 
A total of 704 subjects were randomised 1:1 to either combination or vemurafenib. Most subjects were 
Caucasian (>96%) and male (55%), with a median age of 55 years (24% were ≥65 years). The 
majority of subjects had Stage IV M1c disease (61% overall). Most subjects had LDH ≤ULN (67%), 
ECOG performance status of 0 (70%), and visceral disease (78%) at baseline. Overall, 54% of subjects 
had <3 disease sites at baseline. The majority of subjects had BRAF V600E mutation-positive 
melanoma (89%). Subjects with brain metastases were not included in the trial.

Median OS and estimated 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year and 5-year survival rates are presented in 
Table 8. From an OS analysis at 5 years, the median OS for the combination arm was approximately 
8 months longer than the median OS for vemurafenib monotherapy (26.0 months versus 17.8 months) 
with 5-year survival rates of 36% for the combination versus 23% for vemurafenib monotherapy 
(Table 8, Figure 2). The Kaplan-Meier OS curve appears to stabilise from 3 to 5 years (see Figure 2). 
The 5-year overall survival rate was 46% (95% CI: 38.8, 52.0) in the combination arm versus 28% 
(95% CI: 22.5, 34.6) in the vemurafenib monotherapy arm for patients who had a normal lactate 
dehydrogenase level at baseline, and 16% (95% CI: 9.3, 23.3) in the combination arm versus 10% 
(95% CI: 5.1, 17.4) in the vemurafenib monotherapy arm for patients with an elevated lactate 
dehydrogenase level at baseline.

Prior BRAF inhibitor therapy 
There are limited data in patients taking the combination of trametinib with dabrafenib who have 
progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor. 
Part B of study BRF113220 included a cohort of 26 patients that had progressed on a BRAF inhibitor. 
The trametinib 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily combination demonstrated limited 
clinical activity in patients who had progressed on a BRAF inhibitor (see section 4.4). The 
investigator-assessed confirmed response rate was 15% (95% CI: 4.4, 34.9) and the median PFS was 
3.6 months (95% CI: 1.9, 5.2). Similar results were seen in the 45 patients who crossed over from 
dabrafenib monotherapy to the trametinib 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily 
combination in Part C of this study. In these patients a 13% (95% CI: 5.0, 27.0) confirmed response 
rate was observed with a median PFS of 3.6 months (95% CI: 2, 4).

Patients with brain metastases 
The efficacy and safety of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in patients with BRAF 
mutant-positive melanoma that has metastasised to the brain was studied in a non-randomised, 
open-label, multicentre, Phase II study (COMBI-MB study). A total of 125 patients were enrolled into 
four cohorts: 
• 
Cohort A: patients with BRAFV600E mutant melanoma with asymptomatic brain metastases 
without prior local brain-directed therapy and ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 
Cohort B: patients with BRAFV600E mutant melanoma with asymptomatic brain metastases 
with prior local brain-directed therapy and ECOG performance status of 0 or1. 
Cohort C: patients with BRAFV600D/K/R mutant melanoma with asymptomatic brain 
metastases, with or without prior local brain-directed therapy and ECOG performance status of 
0 or 1. 
Cohort D:  patients with BRAFV600D/E/K/R mutant melanoma with symptomatic brain 
metastases, with or without prior local brain-directed therapy and ECOG performance status of 
0 or 1 or 2. 
• 
• 
• 
The primary endpoint of the study was intracranial response in Cohort A, defined as the percentage of 
patients with a confirmed intracranial response assessed by the investigator using modified Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Intracranial response assessed by the 
investigator in Cohorts B, C and D were secondary endpoints of the study. Due to small sample size 
reflected by wide 95% CIs, the results in Cohorts B, C, and D should be interpreted with caution. 
Efficacy results are summarised in Table 10.

Trametinib monotherapy 
Treatment naïve patients 
The efficacy and safety of trametinib in patients with BRAF unresectable or metastatic mutant 
melanoma (V600E and V600K) were evaluated in a randomised open-label Phase III study 
(MEK114267 [METRIC]). Measurement of patients’ BRAF V600 mutation status was required. 
Patients (N=322) who were treatment naïve or may have received one prior chemotherapy treatment in 
the metastatic setting [Intent to Treat (ITT) population] were randomised 2:1 to receive trametinib 
2 mg once daily or chemotherapy (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 
every 3 weeks). Treatment for all patients continued until disease progression, death or withdrawal. 
The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of trametinib compared to 
chemotherapy with respect to PFS in patients with advanced/metastatic BRAF V600E/K 
mutation-positive melanoma without a prior history of brain metastases (N=273) which is considered 
the primary efficacy population. The secondary endpoints were PFS in the ITT population and OS, 
ORR, and DoR in the primary efficacy population and ITT population. Patients in the chemotherapy 
arm were allowed to cross over to the trametinib arm after independent confirmation of progression. 
Of the patients with confirmed disease progression in the chemotherapy arm, a total of 51 (47%) 
crossed over to receive trametinib. 
Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups in the primary efficacy population 
and the ITT population. In the ITT population, 54% of patients were male and all were Caucasian. The 
median age was 54 years (22% were 65 years); all patients had an ECOG performance score of 0 or 
1; and 3 % had history of brain metastases. Most patients (87%) in the ITT population had BRAF 
V600E mutation and 12% of patients had BRAF V600K. Most patients (66%) received no prior 
chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease. 
The efficacy results in the primary efficacy population were consistent with those in the ITT 
population; therefore, only the efficacy data for the ITT population are presented in Table 11. 
Kaplan-Meier curves of investigator-assessed OS (post-hoc analysis 20 May 2013) is presented in

Prior BRAF inhibitor therapy 
In a single-arm Phase II study, designed to evaluate the objective response rate, safety, and 
pharmacokinetics following dosing of trametinib at 2 mg once daily in patients with BRAF V600E, 
V600K, or V600D mutation-positive metastatic melanoma (MEK113583), two separate cohorts were 
enrolled: Cohort A: patients with prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor either with or without other 
prior therapy, Cohort B: patients with at least 1 prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy, without prior 
treatment with a BRAF inhibitor. 
In Cohort A of this study, trametinib did not demonstrate clinical activity in patients who had 
progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. 
Adjuvant treatment of Stage III melanoma 
BRF115532 (COMBI-AD) 
The efficacy and safety of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib were studied in a Phase III, 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with Stage III (Stage IIIA 
[lymph node metastasis >1 mm], IIIB, or IIIC) cutaneous melanoma with a BRAF V600 E/K 
mutation, following complete resection. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either combination therapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily 
and trametinib 2 mg once daily) or two placebos for a period of 12 months. Enrollment required 
complete resection of melanoma with complete lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to 
randomisation. Any prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, including radiotherapy, was not allowed. 
Patients with a history of prior malignancy, if disease-free for at least 5 years, were eligible. Patients 
presenting with malignancies with confirmed activating RAS mutations were not eligible. Patients 
were stratified by BRAF mutation status (V600E versus V600K) and stage of disease prior to surgery 
using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition Melanoma Staging System (by 
Stage III sub-stage, indicating different levels of lymph node involvement and primary tumour size 
and ulceration). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed relapse-free survival (RFS), defined 
as the time from randomisation to disease recurrence or death from any cause. Radiological tumour 
assessment was conducted every 3 months for the first two years and every 6 months thereafter, until 
first relapse was observed. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS; key secondary 
endpoint), freedom from relapse (FFR) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). 
A total of 870 patients were randomised to the combination therapy (n=438) and placebo (n=432) 
arms. Most patients were Caucasian (99%) and male (55%), with a median age of 51 years (18% were 
≥65 years). The study included patients with all sub-stages of Stage III disease prior to resection; 18% 
of these patients had lymph node involvement only identifiable by microscope and no primary tumour 
ulceration. The majority of patients had a BRAF V600E mutation (91%). At the time of the primary 
analysis, the median duration of follow-up (time from randomisation to last contact or death) was 
2.83 years in the dabrafenib and trametinib combination arm and 2.75 years in the placebo arm. 
Results for the primary analysis of RFS are presented in Table 13. The study showed a statistically 
significant difference for the primary outcome of RFS between treatment arms, with a median RFS of 
16.6 months for the placebo arm and not yet reached for the combination arm (HR: 0.47; 95% 
confidence interval: (0.39, 0.58); p=1.53×10-14). The observed RFS benefit was consistently 
demonstrated across subgroups of patients including age, sex and race. Results were also consistent 
across stratification factors for disease stage and BRAF V600 mutation type.

Based on 153 events (60 [14%] in the combination arm and 93 [22%] in the placebo arm) 
corresponding to a 26% information fraction of the total target of 597 OS events, the estimated hazard 
ratio for OS was 0.57 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.79; p=0.0006). These results did not meet the pre-specified 
boundary to claim statistical significance at this first OS interim analysis (HR=0.50; p=0.000019). 
Survival estimates at 1 and 2 years from randomisation were 97% and 91% in the combination arm 
and 94% and 83% in the placebo arm, respectively.

Non-small cell lung cancer 
Study BRF113928 
The efficacy and safety of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib was studied in a Phase II, 
three-cohort, multicentre, non-randomised and open-label study in which patients with Stage IV 
BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC were enrolled. The primary endpoint was ORR using the RECIST 1.1 
assessed by the investigator. Secondary endpoints included DoR, PFS, OS, safety and population 
pharmacokinetics. ORR, DoR and PFS were also assessed by an Independent Review Committee 
(IRC) as a sensitivity analysis. 
Cohorts were enrolled sequentially: 
• 
• 
• 
Cohort A: Monotherapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily), 84 patients enrolled. 78 patients had 
previous systemic treatment for their metastatic disease. 
Cohort B: Combination therapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once 
daily), 59 patients enrolled. 57 patients had 1-3 lines of previous systemic treatment for their 
metastatic disease. 2 patients had no previous systemic treatment and were included in the 
analysis for patients enrolled in Cohort C. 
Cohort C: Combination therapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once 
daily), 34 patients. All patients received study medicinal product as first-line treatment for 
metastatic disease. 
Among the total of 93 patients who were enrolled in the combination therapy cohorts B and C, most 
patients were Caucasian (>90%), and similar female versus male (54% versus 46%), with a median 
age of 64 years in second-line or higher patients and 68 years in the first-line patients. Most patients 
(94%) enrolled in the combination-therapy-treated cohorts had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 
26 (28%) had never smoked. The majority of patients had a non-squamous histology. In the 
previously-treated population, 38 patients (67%) had one line of systemic anti-cancer therapy for 
metastatic disease. 
At the time of the primary analysis, the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed ORR in the first-line 
population was 61.1% (95% CI, 43.5%, 76.9%), and in the previously-treated population was 66.7% 
(95% CI, 52.9%, 78.6%). These met the statistical significance to reject the null hypothesis that the 
ORR of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib for this NSCLC population was less than or equal 
to 30%. The ORR results assessed by IRC were consistent with the investigator assessment. The final 
analysis of efficacy performed 5 years after last subject first dose is presented in Table 14.

Other studies - pyrexia management analysis 
Study CPDR001F2301 (COMBI-i) and Study CDRB436F2410 (COMBI-Aplus) 
Pyrexia is observed in patients treated with dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy. The initial 
registration studies for the combination therapy in the unresectable or metastatic melanoma setting 
(COMBI-d and COMBI-v; total N=559) and in the adjuvant melanoma setting (COMBI-AD, N=435) 
recommended to interrupt only dabrafenib in case of pyrexia (fever ≥38.5°C). In two subsequent 
studies in unresectable or metastatic melanoma (COMBI-i control arm, N=264) and in the adjuvant 
melanoma setting (COMBI-Aplus, N=552), interruption of both medicinal products when patient’s 
temperature is ≥38oC (COMBI-Aplus), or at the first symptom of pyrexia (COMBI-i; COMBI-Aplus 
for recurrent pyrexia) was advised. In COMBI-i and COMBI-Aplus there was a lower incidence of 
grade 3/4 pyrexia, complicated pyrexia, hospitalisation due to serious pyrexia adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs), the time spent in pyrexia AESIs, and permanent discontinuations from both 
medicinal products due to pyrexia AESIs (the latter in the adjuvant setting only) compared to COMBI-
d, COMBI-v and COMBI-AD. The COMBI-Aplus study met its primary endpoint with a composite 
rate of 8.0% (95% CI: 5.9, 10.6) for grade 3/4 pyrexia, hospitalisation due to pyrexia, or permanent 
treatment discontinuation due to pyrexia compared to 20.0% (95% CI: 16.3, 24.1) for the historical 
control (COMBI-AD). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
trametinib in all subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma and malignant neoplasms 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Trametinib is absorbed orally with median time to achieve peak concentrations of 1.5 hours post-dose. 
The mean absolute bioavailability of a single 2 mg tablet dose is 72% relative to an intravenous (IV) 
microdose. The increase in exposure (Cmax and AUC) was dose-proportional following repeat dosing. 
Following administration of 2 mg once daily, steady-state geometric mean Cmax, AUC(0-) and predose 
concentration were 22.2 ng/ml, 370 ng*hr/ml and 12.1 ng/ml, respectively with a low peak:trough 
ratio (1.8). Inter-subject variability at steady state was low (<28%). 
Trametinib accumulates with repeat daily dosing with a mean accumulation ratio of 6.0 at 2 mg once 
daily dose. Steady state was achieved by Day 15. 
Administration of a single dose of trametinib with a high-fat, high-calorie meal resulted in a 70% and 
10% decrease in Cmax and AUC, respectively compared to fasted conditions (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Distribution 
Binding of trametinib to human plasma proteins is 97.4%. Trametinib has a volume of distribution of 
approximately 1200 L determined following administration of a 5 g intravenous microdose. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that trametinib is metabolised predominantly via 
deacetylation alone or in combination with mono-oxygenation. The deacetylated metabolite was 
further metabolised by glucuronidation. CYP3A4 oxidation is considered a minor pathway of 
metabolism. The deacetylation is mediated by the carboxyl-esterases 1b, 1c and 2, with possible 
contributions by other hydrolytic enzymes. 
Following single and repeated doses of trametinib, trametinib as parent is the main circulating 
component in plasma. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Mean terminal half-life is 127 hours (5.3 days) after single dose administration. Trametinib plasma IV 
clearance is 3.21 L/hr. 
Total dose recovery was low after a 10-day collection period (<50%) following administration of a 
single oral dose of radiolabelled trametinib as a solution, due to the long elimination half-life. 
Drug-related material was excreted predominantly in the faeces (>80% of recovered radioactivity) and 
to a minor extent in urine (≤19%). Less than 0.1% of the excreted dose was recovered as parent in 
urine. 
Special patient populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses and data from a clinical pharmacology study in patients with 
normal hepatic function or with mild, moderate or severe bilirubin and/or AST elevations (based on 
National Cancer Institute [NCI] classification) indicate that hepatic function does not significantly 
affect trametinib oral clearance. 
Renal impairment 
Renal impairment is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on trametinib pharmacokinetics given 
the low renal excretion of trametinib. The pharmacokinetics of trametinib were characterised in 
223 patients enrolled in clinical trials with trametinib who had mild renal impairment and 35 patients 
with moderate renal impairment using a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Mild and moderate 
renal impairment had no effect on trametinib exposure (<6% for either group). No data are available in 
patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
Elderly 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis (range 19 to 92 years), age had no relevant clinical 
effect on trametinib pharmacokinetics. Safety data in patients ≥75 years is limited (see section 4.8). 
Race 
There are insufficient data to evaluate the potential effect of race on trametinib pharmacokinetics as 
clinical experience is limited to Caucasians. 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of trametinib in paediatric 
patients. 
Body weight and gender 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender and body weight were found to influence 
trametinib oral clearance. Although smaller female subjects are predicted to have higher exposure than 
heavier male subjects, these differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment 
is warranted. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal product interactions 
Effects of trametinib on drug-metabolising enzymes and transporters: In vitro and in vivo data suggest 
that trametinib is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products. Based on in 
vitro studies, trametinib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. 
Trametinib was found to be an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, an inducer of 
CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of the transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
P-gp and BCRP. However, based on the low dose and low clinical systemic exposure relative to the in 
vitro potency of inhibition or induction values, trametinib is not considered to be an in vivo inhibitor or 
inducer of these enzymes or transporters, although transient inhibition of BCRP substrates in the gut 
may occur (see section 4.5). 
Effects of other drugs on trametinib: In vivo and in vitro data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of 
trametinib are unlikely to be affected by other medicinal products. Trametinib is not a substrate of 
CYP enzymes or of the transporters BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1, MRP2, and 
MATE1. Trametinib is an in vitro substrate of BSEP and the efflux transporter P-gp. Although 
trametinib exposure is unlikely to be affected by inhibition of BSEP, increased levels of trametinib 
upon strong inhibition of hepatic P-gp cannot be excluded (see section 4.5). 
Effects of trametinib on other medicinal products: the effect of repeat-dose trametinib on the steady 
state pharmacokinetics of combination oral contraceptives, norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol, was 
assessed in a clinical study that consisted of 19 female patients with solid tumours. Norethindrone 
exposure increased by 20% and ethinyl estradiol exposure was similar when co-administered with 
trametinib. Based on these results, no loss of efficacy of hormonal contraceptives is expected when 
co-administered with trametinib monotherapy. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenicity studies with trametinib have not been conducted. Trametinib was not genotoxic in 
studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells and 
micronuclei in the bone marrow of rats. 
Trametinib may impair female fertility in humans, as in repeat-dose studies, increases in cystic 
follicles and decreases in corpora lutea were observed in female rats at exposures below the human 
clinical exposure based on AUC. 
Additionally, in juvenile rats given trametinib, decreased ovarian weights, slight delays in hallmarks of 
female sexual maturation (vaginal opening and increased incidence of prominent terminal end buds 
within the mammary gland) and slight hypertrophy of the surface epithelium of the uterus were 
observed. All of these effects were reversible following an off-treatment period and attributable to 
pharmacology. However, in rat and dog toxicity studies up to 13 weeks in duration, there were no 
treatment effects observed in male reproductive tissues. 
In embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, trametinib induced maternal and 
developmental toxicity. In rats decreased foetal weights and increased post-implantation loss were 
seen at exposures below or slightly above the clinical exposures based on AUC. In an embryo-foetal 
developmental toxicity study with rabbits, decreased foetal body weight, increased abortions, 
increased incidence of incomplete ossification and skeletal malformations were seen at sub-clinical 
exposures based on AUC). 
In repeat-dose studies the effects seen after trametinib exposure are found mainly in the skin, 
gastrointestinal tract, haematological system, bone and liver. Most of the findings are reversible after 
drug-free recovery. In rats, hepatocellular necrosis and transaminase elevations were seen after 
8 weeks at ≥0.062 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.8 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In mice, lower heart rate, heart weight and left ventricular function were observed without cardiac 
histopathology after 3 weeks at ≥0.25 mg/kg/day trametinib (approximately 3 times human clinical 
exposure based on AUC) for up to 3 weeks. In adult rats, mineralisation of multiple organs was 
associated with increased serum phosphorus and was closely associated with necrosis in heart, liver 
and kidney and haemorrhage in the lung at exposures comparable to the human clinical exposure. In 
rats, hypertrophy of the physis and increased bone turnover were observed, but the physeal 
hypertrophy is not expected to be clinically relevant for adult humans. In rats and dogs given 
trametinib at or below clinical exposures, bone marrow necrosis, lymphoid atrophy in thymus and 
GALT and lymphoid necrosis in lymph nodes, spleen and thymus were observed, which have the 
potential to impair immune function. In juvenile rats, increased heart weight with no histopathology 
was observed at 0.35 mg/kg/day (approximately twice the adult human clinical exposure based on 
AUC). 
Trametinib was phototoxic in an in vitro mouse fibroblast 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay at 
significantly higher concentrations than clinical exposures (IC50 at 2.92 µg/ml, ≥130 times the clinical 
exposure based on Cmax), indicating that there is low risk for phototoxicity to patients taking 
trametinib. 
Combination with dabrafenib 
In a study in dogs in which trametinib and dabrafenib were given in combination for 4 weeks, signs of 
gastro-intestinal toxicity and decreased lymphoid cellularity of the thymus were observed at lower 
exposures than in dogs given trametinib alone. Otherwise, similar toxicities were observed as in 
comparable monotherapy studies.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Mekinist is and what it is used for 
Mekinist is a medicine that contains the active substance trametinib. It is used either on its own or in 
combination with another medicine containing dabrafenib to treat a type of skin cancer called 
melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body, or cannot be removed by surgery. 
Mekinist in combination with dabrafenib is also used to prevent melanoma from coming back after it 
has been removed by surgery. 
Mekinist in combination with dabrafenib is also used to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Both cancers have a particular change (mutation) in a gene called BRAF at the V600 position. This 
mutation in the gene may have caused the cancer to develop. Your medicine targets proteins made 
from this mutated gene and slows down or stops the development of your cancer. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Mekinist 
Mekinist should only be used to treat melanomas and NSCLC with the BRAF mutation. Therefore, 
before starting treatment your doctor will test for this mutation. 
If your doctor decides that you will receive treatment with the combination of Mekinist and 
dabrafenib, read the dabrafenib leaflet carefully as well as this leaflet. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Do not take Mekinist 
• 
if you are allergic to trametinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

coloured dots in your vision 
halo (seeing a blurred outline around objects) 
blurred vision 
Changes in your skin 
Serious skin reactions have been reported in people taking Mekinist in combination with dabrafenib 
(frequency not known). If you notice any of the following: 
• 
reddish patches on the trunk that are circular or target-shaped, with central blisters. Skin 
peeling. Ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes. These serious skin rashes can be 
preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). 
widespread rash, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes (DRESS-syndrome or drug hypersensitivity 
syndrome). 
➔ 
stop using the medicine and seek medical attention immediately 
• 
Up to 3 in 100 people taking Mekinist in combination with dabrafenib may develop a different type of 
skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC). Others may develop a type of skin 
cancer called basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Usually, these skin changes remain local and can be 
removed with surgery and treatment with Mekinist and dabrafenib can be continued without 
interruption. 
Some people taking Mekinist in combination with dabrafenib may also notice that new melanomas 
have appeared. These melanomas are usually removed by surgery and treatment with Mekinist and 
dabrafenib can be continued without interruption. 
Your doctor will check your skin before you start taking dabrafenib, then check it again every month 
while you are taking dabrafenib and for 6 months after you stop taking it. This is to look for any new 
skin cancers. 
Your doctor will also check your head, neck, mouth and lymph glands and you will have scans of your 
chest and stomach area (called CT scans) regularly. You may also have blood tests. These checks are 
to detect if any other cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, develops inside your body. Pelvic 
examinations (for women) and anal examinations are also recommended before and at the end of your 
treatment. 
Mekinist as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib can cause rash or acne-like rash. Follow 
your doctor’s instructions for what to do to help prevent rash. Tell your doctor or nurse as soon as

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for venetoclax, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
The serious infections (such as sepsis, pneumonia, septic shock etc.) are considered to be the most common 
cause of death (after those associated with the underlying malignancy or disease progression) in relation 
to  venetoclax  treatment.  In  this  reporting  interval,  a  total  of  765  reports  of  serious  infections  were 
identified.  Since  the  overall  number  of  events  of  serious  infections  is  high,  the  healthcare  professionals 
should be explicitly reminded of these cases. Section 4.4 of the SmPC for Venclyxto should therefore include 
a  standalone  undersection  entitled  “infections”,  including  the  warning  statement  regarding  the  risk  of 
infections and their monitoring. The Package leaflet should be updated accordingly. 
In addition, the actual format of text for recommendation for dose reduction in case of concomitant use 
with CYP3A inhibitors is considered difficult to read and respective data would be more easily readable when 
displayed in tabular format. The relevant information in section 4.2 of the SmPC for Venclyxto should be 
amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for venetoclax the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing venetoclax is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

During the review of the renewal, the CHMP requested 
Product Characteristics (SPC) to include safety 
information on hyperoxaluria and oxalate 
nephropathy and hypothyroidism. Section 4.5 of the 
SPC  was also updated to include information on 
interactions with anticonvulsivants and update the 
information on interaction with amodiarone. Section 
2 of the Package Leaflet was amended accordingly. 
additional information on renal disorders, drug interactions 
involving levothyroxine, amiodarone and anticonvulsivants.  
Following the review of this additional information, the 
CHMP concluded that an update of the Product Information 
should be made in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the SPC. 
This variation application was submitted further to this 
request of the CHMP and the following information was 
added: 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
- The use of orlistat may be associated with hyperoxaluria 
Package Leaflet 
and oxalate nephropathy in patients with underlying 
chronic kidney disease and/or volume depletion; 
- Rare occurrence of hypothyroidism and/or reduced control 
of hypothyroidism may occur. The mechanism, although 
not proven, may involve a decreased absorption of iodine 
salts and/or levothyroxine; 
- Antiepileptics patient: Orlistat may unbalance 
Page 11/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anticonvulsivant treatment by decreasing the absorption of 
antiepileptic drugs, leading to convulsions. Convulsions 
have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with 
orlistat and antiepileptic drugs e.g. valproate, lamotrigine, 
for which a causal relationship to an interaction cannot be 
excluded. Therefore, these patients should be monitored for 
possible changes in the frequency and/or severity of 
convulsions.  
- Oxalate nephropathy as a postmarketing adverse event. 
Special warnings and precautions for use related to the 
concomitant use with amodiarone was also updated to 
reflect that the clinical relevance of the slight decrease in 
plasma levels of amiodarone, when given as a single dose, 
remains unknown but may become clinically relevant in 
some cases.

With regards to rectal haemorrhage/blood in stool, the 
following information was included in the product

With regards to unintended pregnancy, the following 
information was included in the product information: 
Section 4.4 of the SPC (The use of an additional 
contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible 
failure of oral contraception that could occur in case of 
severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5)) and section 4.5 of the 
SPC (The absence of an interaction between oral 
contraceptives and orlistat has been demonstrated in 
specific drug-drug interaction studies. However, orlistat 
may indirectly reduce the availability of oral contraceptives 
and lead to unexpected pregnancies in some individual 
cases. An additional contraceptive method is recommended 
in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.4)). The package 
leaflet was amended accordingly.

randomised to receive either 120 mg orlistat (n=357) or 
placebo (n=182) three times daily as an adjunct to a 
hypocaloric diet and exercise for 52 weeks with a primary 
endpoint of change in body mass index (BMI) from baseline 
to the end of the study. The results were significantly 
superior in the orlistat group (difference in BMI of 0.86 
kg/m2 in favour of orlistat). 9.5 % of the orlistat treated 
patients versus 3.3 % of the placebo treated patients lost = 
10 % of body weight after 1 year with a mean difference of 
2.6 kg between the two groups. The difference was driven 
by the outcome in the group of patients with = 5 % weight 
loss after 12 weeks of treatment with orlistat representing 
19 % of the initial population. The side effects were 
generally similar to those observed in adults. However, 
there was an unexplained increase in the incidence of bone 
fractures (6 % versus 2.8 % in the orlistat and placebo 
groups, respectively).

criterion at 12 weeks in the indication labelling.Clarification 
was provided in section 4.5 of the SPC on the 
recommendation for monitoring during concomittant use of 
cyclosporine with orlistat. Guidance was also provided on 
the lack of specific interactions observed in drug-drug 
interaction studies. 
The section 5.1 was updated to give more information on 
the results of the available analyses of the comparative

completion of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomised clinical trial (XENDOS study) Over 4 years, 
orlistat associated with diet significantly decreased body 
weight and BMI when compared to placebo. Consequently, 
the effect of orlistat with respect to the currently approved 
indication was adequately demonstrated over a long-time 
period. Data from the 4-year clinical trial showed 41% of 
the orlistat treated patients versus 21% of placebo treated 
patients lost 3 10% of body weight after 1 year with a 
mean difference of 4.4 kg between the two groups. After 4 
years of treatment 21% of the orlistat treated patients 
compared to 10% of the placebo treated patients had lost 
310% of body weight, with a mean difference of 2.7 
kg.Data from the 4-year clinical trial also suggested that 
weight loss achieved with orlistat delayed the development 
of type 2 diabetes during the study (cumulative diabetes 
cases incidences: 3.4% in the orlistat group compared to 
5.4% in the placebo-treated group). The great majority of 
diabetes cases came from the subgroup of patients with 
impaired glucose tolerance at baseline, which represented

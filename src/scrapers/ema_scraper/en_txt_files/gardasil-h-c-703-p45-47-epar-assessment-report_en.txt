Clinical aspects 
1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a report for: 
V501: An Immunogenicity and Safety Study of GARDASIL (Human Papillomavirus [Types 6, 11, 16, 18] 
Recombinant Vaccine) in females 9 to 23 years of age in Korea. 
2.  Clinical study 
V501: An Immunogenicity and Safety Study of GARDASIL (Human Papillomavirus [Types 6, 11, 16, 18] 
Recombinant Vaccine) in females 9 to 23 years of age in Korea. 
Description 
  Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
Primary: To evaluate the vaccine-induced serum anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-
HPV 18 responses following administration of a 3-dose regimen of GARDASIL in females 9 to 23 
years of age in Korea. 
Secondary: To demonstrate that a 3-dose regimen of GARDASIL is generally well tolerated in 
females 9 to 23 years of age in Korea. 
•  Study design 
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, immunogenicity and safety 
study in preadolescent and adolescent females aged 9 to 23 years old. For each subject enrolled, 
the duration of the study was approximately 7 months. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 171 subjects were to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either quadrivalent 
HPV vaccine or adjuvant containing placebo. 
•  Treatments 
Participants received a total of 3 intramuscular injections of GARDASIL or placebo at Day 1, 
Month 2 (±3 weeks), and Month 6 (±4 weeks). 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
For immunogenicity, the main endpoints of interest were: 
-  Percentage of subjects who seroconverted for each HPV Type 6, 11, 16, 18 by Week 4 Postdose 
3 
-  Anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 GMTs Week 4 Postdose 3

The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) was 
used to detect antibody to HPV virus-like particles (VLPs), serotypes 6, 11, 16, 18 before and after 
vaccination with the HPV quadrivalent vaccine. The seropositivity cutoffs for the HPV 6, 11, 16, 
and 18 cLIAs are 20 mMU/mL, 16 mMU/mL, 20 mMU/mL,and 24 mMU/mL, respectively.  
Safety was assessed by injection site reactions, systemic adverse reactions (up to 14 days after each 
injection), and serious adverse events.  
•  Statistical Methods 
An exact binomial 95% confidence interval proportion of subjects who seroconvert to each of HPV 
6, 11, 16, 18 at Week 4 Postdose 3 was calculated and the response for each HPV type was 
considered acceptable if the lower bound of the 95% exact binomial confidence interval on the 
seroconversion rate was at least 90%. It was assumed that the true seroconversion rate for each 
HPV type was 98.5%. A separate test was performed for all 4 HPV types. Success was required 
for all 4 tests. 
The primary hypothesis test was performed on the per-protocol population to determine the 
success of the study and on the All Type-Specific HPV Naïve Subjects with Serology Data 
Population1 as a secondary approach. The GMTs to each of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 were summarized 
and 95% confidence intervals for the GMTs were calculated. 
  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 176 subjects were screened for participation at 10 investigative sites. A total of 176 
subjects (100%) were randomized to 1 of 2 vaccination groups and received at least one injection 
of GARDASIL or placebo. Of the 176 subjects, 175 subjects (99.4%) received all 3 vaccinations. 
• 
Immunogenicity results 
Table 1 presents a summary of the percentages of subjects who seroconverted for each vaccine 
HPV type by Week 4 Postdose 3 in the per-protocol immunogenicity group. Estimated 
seroconversion rates and associated 95% confidence intervals are shown for each vaccine HPV 
type. The statistical criterion for primary hypothesis was met: the lower bound of the 95% exact 
binomial confidence interval on the seroconversion rate was at least 90% for each vaccine HPV 
type. Overall, >98% of subjects seroconverted by Week 4 Postdose 3, for each of the 4 HPV 
types summarized in the per-protocol immunogenicity group. Therefore, GARDASIL induced 
acceptable anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 responses in females 9 to 23 years of age in Korea. 
The results from the All Type-Specific HPV-Naïve Subjects With Serology Data population support 
the results in the per-protocol immunogenicity group (data not shown in this AR). 
Table 2 presents a summary of anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 
GMTs measured 4 weeks Postdose 3 in the per-protocol immunogenicity group. A analysis per 
age group revealed that GMTs in younger subjects (9 to 17 years of age) were more robust than 
those in older subjects (18 to 23 years of age).

•  Safety results 
Overall, 78% of subjects who received GARDASIL and 71% of subjects who received placebo 
reported a clinical adverse experience. Compared with subjects who received placebo, more 
subjects who received GARDASIL reported injection-site adverse experiences (73% vs. 56%). On 
the other hand, fewer subjects who received GARDASIL reported systemic adverse experiences 
(32% vs. 44%). The incidence of serious adverse experiences, deaths, and discontinuations due 
to adverse experiences were comparable between the 2 vaccination groups. 
3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Among healthy subjects between the ages of 9 years and 23 years in Korea who received GARDASIL, the 
following conclusions can be drawn: 
1.  The administration of a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine 
to 9 to 23 year old female induces over 98% seroconversion rate for anti-HPV 6, anti- HPV 11, 
anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18. 
2.  The administration of a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine 
to 9 to 23 year old female induces robust geometric titers for anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 
16, and anti-HPV 18. 
3.  The administration of a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine 
to 9 to 23 year old female is generally well tolerated.

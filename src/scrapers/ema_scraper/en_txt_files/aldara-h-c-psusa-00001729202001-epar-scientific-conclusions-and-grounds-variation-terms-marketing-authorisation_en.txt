Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for imiquimod, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
Regarding the risk of exacerbation of autoimmune conditions, the PRAC considers that since this is 
reflected in Section 4.8 of the SmPC and relevant warnings are included in section 4.4, the Package 
Leaflet should reflect this information. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for imiquimod the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing imiquimod is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

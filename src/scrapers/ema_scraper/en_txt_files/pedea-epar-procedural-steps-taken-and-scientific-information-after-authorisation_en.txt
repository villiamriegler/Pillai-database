Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC, upon request by 
21/03/2013 
10/03/2014 
SmPC and 
The MAH has submitted a variation to update the SmPC as 
the CHMP following the assessment of PSUR 7 and 
Annex II 
requested by the CHMP following the assessment of PSUR 7 
PS2 018.1, with wording to emphasise that close 
attention should be paid to pulmonary pressure if 
hypoxaemia occurs during or following Pedea 
and PS2 018.1.  
The MAH has analysed the cumulative cases registered in 
the global safety database of patients treated with Pedea 
Page 6/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infusion, and update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to 
reflect that cases of pulmonary hypertension have 
been reported post-marketing. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to update annex II in line with 
the latest QRD template version 8.3. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested

n/a 
Certificate of Suitability to the relevant Ph. Eur. 
Monograph - Updated certificate from an already 
approved manufacturer 
and who experienced pulmonary hypertension (PH) or 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The cumulative 
review covers the period from 01/01/1990 to 29/03/2012. 
The degree of prematurity of new-borns and its influence 
on the risk of PH in neonates were taken into consideration 
in this cumulative analysis. The review included all patients 
who experienced a PH event including all those who were 
enrolled in Pedea clinical studies. 
Following the assessment of the provided data, the existing 
warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding pulmonary 
hypertension has been reinforced to emphasise that if 
hypoxemia occurs during or following Pedea infusion, close 
attention should be paid to pulmonary pressure. Further, 
the current text in section 4.8 has been updated to mention 
that post-marketing cases of pulmonary hypertension have 
also been reported which were possibly related to Pedea 
administration. No changes to the Package Leaflet are 
considered necessary as these issues are already 
sufficiently covered. Finally, the MAH has updated annex II 
in line with the latest QRD template version 8.3, which is 
acceptable. 
The variation does not have any impact on the benefit/risk 
balance for Pedea, which remains positive for the approved 
indications.

SmPC, 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
Labelling and 
on the basis of the re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
PL 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Pedea continues 
to be favourable. The CHMP is also of the opinion that the 
renewal can be granted with unlimited validity. PSURs will 
now be submitted every 3 years.

Following the assessment of the 1st PSUR by the CHMP, the 
Package Leaflet 
MAH updated sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC to include 
information on the potential interaction with 
aminoglycosides. As ibuprofen may decrease the clearance 
of aminoglycosides, their co-administration may increase 
the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity and strict 
surveillance of their serum levels is recommended during 
co-administration with ibuprofen. The corresponding 
section 2 of the Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Aripiprazole,  a  dihydrocarbostyril  (quinolinone)  derivative,  is  an  antipsychotic  agent.  Aripiprazole 
(Abilify)  was  authorised  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  on  4  June  2004.  Aripiprazole  tablets, 
orodispersible  tablets  and  oral  solution  are  currently  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of 
schizophrenia in adults with recommended starting dose of 10 mg or 15 mg/day and target dose of 15 
mg/day  administered  on  a  once-a-day  schedule  irrespective  of  meals.  These  formulations  are  also 
indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  manic  episodes  in  Bipolar  I  disorder  and  for  the 
prevention  of  a  new  manic  episode  in  patients  who  experienced  predominantly  manic  episodes  and 
whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.  
Abilify tablets, orodispersible tablets and oral solution are also approved in the EU for the treatment of 
schizophrenia  in  adolescents  15  years  and  older.  The  recommended  dose  in  this  patient  group  is 
10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule irrespective of meals. Treatment should be initiated 
at 2 mg (using Abilify oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional days to reach 
the  recommended  daily  dose  of  10  mg.  When  appropriate,  subsequent  dose  increases  should  be 
administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg. 
In  December  2012,  the  CHMP  recommended  a  variation  to  the  marketing  authorisation  to  add  the 
following  paediatric  indication:  “treatment  up  to  12 weeks  of  moderate  to  severe  manic  episodes  in 
Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older”. 
Aripiprazole intramuscular (7.5mg/ml, solution for injection) is specifically indicated for the treatment 
of the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients 
with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate. 
This variation refers to an update of section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to 
add  information  on  the  risk  of  suicidality  in  paediatric  patients  based  on  the  results  of  the 
epidemiological study CN138598.  
Study CN138598 was submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006. 
2.2.  Clinical Safety aspects 
As part of the variation to extend the indication of schizophrenia to adolescents aged 15 years and 
older, the MAH made the following commitment (FUM 50): 
In January 2011, the protocol was agreed by the CHMP.  
Within this variation application, the MAH submitted the final results of study CN138598.

EMA/488885/2013 
Page 3/16 
 
  
  
The  main  objective  of  Study  CN138598  was  to  determine  the  combined  incidence  of  suicidal  events 
(attempted  or  completed  suicides)  in  patients  less  than  18  years  of  age  after  first  exposure  to  an 
atypical antipsychotic (i.e., in an inception cohort; no evidence of previous exposure to antipsychotics). 
Within this cohort, the event rates for aripiprazole users were compared to event rates for users of all 
other atypical antipsychotics. 
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Three study sites were included in this study: (1) HealthCore Inc., (2) Kaiser Permanente Health Plan, 
and (3) Henry Ford Health System. Each study site had access to detailed automated patient level data 
(including cause of death data) and served as the source of the base population for 2 previous MAH-
sponsored observational studies of suicide events in adult patients. 
While the electronic format of data from each site chosen was not identical, the principal investigators 
of  this  study  had  experience  compiling  data  from  these  multiple  sources  and  had  developed  site-
specific algorithms needed to construct a single, uniform analytic dataset. 
All  patients  less  than  18  years  of  age  who  received  at  least  one  prescription  for  a  typical  or  atypical 
antipsychotic from 1 November 2002 through to 31 December 2009 were identified. The first atypical 
antipsychotic  prescription  filled  during  the  study  period  was  considered  as  the  index  prescription. 
Although  only  atypical  antipsychotics  were  evaluated  in  this  study,  patients  exposed  to  typical  or 
atypical  antipsychotics  before  the  index  date  were  excluded  to  identify  new  users  (inception  cohort) 
not  previously  exposed  to  any  antipsychotic.  Any  patient  not  continuously  enrolled  in  the 
database/health  plan  for  at  least  90  days  before  the  index  date  was  excluded  from  the  study 
population. The study population was further limited to individuals with no previous prescription filled 
for any antipsychotic any time before the index date (all available historical data were used to exclude 
patients  with  previous  antipsychotic  exposure).  All  patients  identified  using  this  approach  formed  the 
base population for the inception cohort and were considered previously unexposed. 
The  endpoint  for  this  study  was  the  combined  incidence  of  suicidal  events  (i.e.,  attempted  or 
completed  suicide)  recorded  through  the  end  of  the  follow-up  period  (31  December  2009).  All  health 
system  encounters  associated  with  serious  suicide  attempts  (defined  as  hospitalization  or  emergency 
department  encounter  associated  with  a  suicide  attempt)  were  collected,  and  follow  up  continued  for 
patients  who  attempted  suicide  until  one  of  the  censoring  events  occurred  e.g.  death  from  suicide, 
disenrollment from the database/health plan, death from any cause (other than suicide), attaining 18 
years of age, or end of the study period. 
Statistical Analysis 
Descriptive  statistics,  including  means  and  percentages,  were  calculated  according  to  demographics 
and clinical characteristics. Rates of suicide events were calculated as number of events among current 
users divided by current use person-time. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare rate 
of  suicide  events  (i.e.,  attempted  or  completed  suicides  combined)  in  current  users  of  aripiprazole  to 
the  rate  of  current  users  of  all  other  atypical  antipsychotics. Adjusted  Hazard  Ratios  (HRs)  controlled 
for  the  following  variables:  age,  gender,  previous  suicide  attempt,  indication  for  antipsychotic  use, 
comorbidity,  health  care  encounters,  study  site,  history  of  antipsychotic  use,  exposure  to 
pharmacotherapy and year of index prescription. 
In  this  population,  a  validation  substudy  was  also  conducted,  using  a  medical  record  review  on  a 
sample  of  charts  (n=386)  to  determine  the  validity  of  claims-based  diagnosis  codes  to  ascertain 
indication  for  antipsychotic  use  in  paediatric/adolescent  patients.  Schizophrenia,  bipolar  disorder  and 
autism  were  included  in  the  validation  substudy.  Descriptive  analyses  were  performed  to  compare

claims  data  with  data  obtained  from  the  medical  record.  A  sensitivity/specificity  analysis  was 
performed for each of the behavioural diagnoses that were indicated for use according to the Product 
Information.

Validation - Substudy Results 
Results  from  the  substudy  evaluating  the  indication  for  antipsychotic  use  demonstrated  that,  in  a 
subset of this paediatric population (n=386), automated data accurately identified patients with bipolar 
disorder  and  schizophrenia.  Hyperkinetic  syndrome  of  childhood  or  ADHD  (claims-based  diagnoses: 
35.2%;  chart-based  diagnoses:  28.2%),  disturbance  of  emotions  specific  to  childhood  adolescence 
(claims-based  diagnoses:  21.5%;  chart-based  diagnoses:  15.5%)  and  anxiety,  dissociative,  and 
somatoform  disorders  (claims-based  diagnoses:  19.4%;  chart-based  diagnoses:  9.6%)  were 
frequently coded behavioural diagnoses in this population.  
However, the accuracy of identifying precise indication beyond the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 
conditions was limited. The sensitivity for bipolar disorder was  81.3% and the specificity was 89.5%. 
The sensitivity for schizophrenia was 100.0%, and the specificity was 99.0%. The sensitivity for autism 
was 40.9%, and the specificity was 97.5%. 
2.2.3.  Additional Analyses 
At  the  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  provided  additional  analyses  per  paediatric  subgroups  (schizophrenia 
and Bipolar Disorder as defined by ICD9 diagnosis codes), taking into account other factors such as the 
comorbidities  and  concomitant  medication.  Furthermore,  an  analysis  related  to  the  occurrence  of 
suicide within the first 28 days following the initiation of treatment in the entire study population was 
performed by the MAH. Results are presented below.

2.2.4.  Discussion 
After  reviewing  the  original  analysis  based  on  the  overall  population  (see  Table  1),  the  CHMP  noted 
that  only  2.8%  of  the  patients  studied  had  schizophrenia.  Moreover,  the  mean  age  of  paediatric 
patients  was  12.9,  and  from  the  CHMP  viewpoint,  the  risk  of  suicide  is  generally  higher  in  older 
children. Therefore the CHMP considered that the presented results were not sufficient to evaluate the 
risk  of  suicide  in  the  authorised  paediatric  indication,  which  at  the  time  of  the  submission  of  this 
variation  application,  was  limited  to  schizophrenia  in  adolescents  aged  15  years  and  older.  At  the 
CHMP  request,  additional  analyses  were  performed  per  paediatric  subgroups  (schizophrenia  and 
Bipolar  Disorder  as  defined  by  ICD9  diagnosis  codes)  and  taking  into  account  other  factors  such  as 
comorbidities  and  concomitant  medications.  Furthermore,  an  analysis  related  to  the  occurrence  of 
suicide within the first 28 days following the initiation of treatment was performed in the entire study 
population by the MAH. All these analyses were based with an age cut off of 15 years, since at the time 
of  the  responses  to  the  CHMP  request  for  supplementary  information,  the  paediatric  indication  was 
limited to schizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older. 
In schizophrenia patients aged 15 years and above, the studied population had a very high percentage 
of chronic pain and concomitant use of opiates, analgesics and corticosteroids (see Table 6). Presence 
of  ADHD  and  use  of  stimulants  were  also  very  high,  29.8%  and  34.2%  respectively.  These  aspects 
may  differently  influence  the  risk  of  suicide.  Similar  findings  were  observed  in  the  Bipolar  Disorder 
population  with  frequent  presence  of  comorbidities  e.g.  ADHD,  anxiety  disorders  and  chronic  pain. 
Most suicidal events (4 out of 5) occurred in the schizophrenia population 15 years and above, with a 
rate  per  1,000  person-years,  almost  double  than  with  the  other  agents  (see  Table  7)  and  this  was 
considered by the CHMP of concern in spite of the large and overlapping confidence intervals. Even the 
adjusted hazard ratios comparing suicidal events in paediatric patients with ICD-9 codes indicative of 
Bipolar  Disorder  exposed  to  current  use  of  aripiprazole  to  current  use  of  other  atypical  antipsychotic 
agents  showed  an  increased  risk  compared  to  other  antipsychotics  (see  Table  12),  although  the  CIs 
still were highly overlapping.  Hence, the CHMP was not in agreement with the MAH proposal to include 
a statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the results of this study, suggesting that there was 
no  increased  risk  of  suicidality  with  aripiprazole  compared  to  other  treatment.  The  CHMP  considered 
that the results of the study were not sufficiently robust to make such conclusion. In addition, although 
there  was  no  sizeable  database  at  the  time  of  this  variation  that  can  contribute  to  an  adequate  EU 
sample size to evaluate the  risk of suicide in the paediatric population, the CHMP was of the opinion 
Assessment report  
EMA/488885/2013 
Page 14/16 
 
  
  
that information in the SmPC should as far as possible relate to the intended (authorised) use, and no 
convincing arguments on the relevance of the available data to EU use had been provided by the MAH. 
On this basis, the MAH did not wish to pursue their initial proposed statement to reflect the results of 
this  epidemiological  study  and  hence  did  not  provide  further  analyses  taking  into  account  paediatric 
patients  with  Bipolar  Disorder  aged  13  years  and  older  and  the  launch  dates  of  the  antipsychotic 
agents, as requested by the CHMP. Subsequently, the MAH proposed to reflect in the SmPC that there 
are  insufficient  paediatric  data  to  evaluate  the  risk  of  suicide  with  aripiprazole  compared  to  other 
antipsychotics  in  younger  patients  (below  18 years  of  age).  This  proposal  was  considered  acceptable 
by the CHMP and the MAH updated the Product Information in line with the final CHMP recommended 
wording (see 2.3).  
Regarding  temporal  dispersion  on  suicide  events  rate  on  the  first  4  weeks  of  use  of  aripiprazole  in 
Bipolar Disorder patients only, the CHMP noted that suicide events occurring in the first 4 weeks were 
much  more  likely  to  occur  with  other  atypical  antipsychotics  than  with  aripiprazole,  with  no  CIs 
overlapping.  The  incidence  rates  (per  1,000  person-years)  were  respectively,  3.26  (0.40,  11.79)  and 
18.35  (12.92,  25.30)  for  aripiprazole  and  other  atypical  agents  (see  Table  13).  The  adjusted  hazard 
ratios comparing suicide events in aripiprazole users versus other atypical agents users during the first 
4 weeks were 0.17 (0.04-0.72) and 0.19 (0.05-0.81). Therefore the CHMP concluded that the risk of 
suicide events with aripiprazole appeared to have a different temporal pattern, with the risk being well 
more  distributed  over  the  time.  Whilst  acknowledging  that  the  presented  data  were  insufficient  to 
evaluate  the  risk  of  suicide  with  aripiprazole  compared  to  other  antipsychotics  in  younger  patients 
(below  18 years  of  age),  the  CHMP  recommended  to  include  in  the  SmPC  that  the  risk  of  suicide 
persists  beyond  the  first  4  weeks  of  treatment  for  atypical  antipsychotics,  including  aripiprazole.  This 
statement was agreed by the MAH (see 2.3). 
2.3.  Changes to the Product Information 
The  MAH  initially  proposed  the  following  changes  to  the  Product  Information  (PI).New  text  is 
underlined: 
SmPC - Section 4.4 
The  occurrence  of  suicidal  behaviour  is  inherent  in  psychotic  illnesses  and  mood  disorders  and  in 
some  cases  has  been  reported  early  after  initiation  or  switch  of  antipsychotic  therapy,  including 
treatment  with  aripiprazole  (see  section  4.8).  Close  supervision  of  high-risk  patients  should 
accompany antipsychotic therapy. Results of an epidemiological study suggested that there was no 
increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among adult patients 
with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Results of an epidemiological study in paediatric patients with 
any  diagnosis  suggested  that  there  was  no  increased  risk  of  suicidality  with  aripiprazole  compared 
to other atypical antipsychotics. 
During the procedure, the CHMP requested amendments to the initially proposed PI, as discussed in 
detail above. The new text finally approved by the CHMP is as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/488885/2013

SmPC- Section 4.4  
The  occurrence  of  suicidal  behaviour  is  inherent  in  psychotic  illnesses  and  mood  disorders  and  in 
some  cases  has  been  reported  early  after  initiation  or  switch  of  antipsychotic  therapy,  including 
treatment  with  aripiprazole  (see  section 4.8).  Close  supervision  of  high-risk  patients  should 
accompany antipsychotic therapy. Results of an epidemiological study suggested that there was no 
increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among adult patients 
with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There are insufficient paediatric data to evaluate this risk in 
younger  patients  (below  18 years  of  age),  but  there  is  evidence  that  the  risk  of  suicide  persists 
beyond the first 4 weeks of treatment for atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
On the basis of the submitted data, the CHMP concluded that the update of the Product Information 
regarding the results of the paediatric epidemiological study (CN 138598) was adequate. The CHMP 
considered  that  the  changes  do  not  affect  the  benefit  risk  profile  of  the  product,  which  remains 
positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable 
and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

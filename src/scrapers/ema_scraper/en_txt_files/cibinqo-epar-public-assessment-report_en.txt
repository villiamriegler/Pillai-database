2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition characterised by dry, pruritic 
skin. The goals of treatment for AD include improving the skin’s barrier function, suppressing 
inflammation, and relieving pruritus, one of the key diagnostic criteria for AD. Because of the chronic 
and recurrent nature of AD, patients often require long-term treatment to relieve symptoms and 
prevent flares. AD may have different endotypes, including race, ethnicity and age, and patients with 
and without filaggrin mutations (Czarnowicki et al, 2019). Lesions can affect any part of the body, but 
distribution and morphology are distinguishably different between pediatric and adult populations 
(Akdis et al, 2006; Weidinger & Novak, 2016; Guttman-Yassky et al, 2018).  
Patients with moderate to severe AD disease are targeted for abrocitinib treatment. Disease severity 
(mild/moderate/severe) is determined in clinical practice by evaluating objective disease features such 
as erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusts, excoriations, lichenification and disease extent as well 
as by subjective patient assessment of pruritus and sleep disturbance. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The observational literature suggests that AD affects up to 25% of children and up to 14% of adults 
worldwide (Sidbury, 2014; Theodosiou et al, 2019).  Research suggests that approximately 17% of 
adolescents and up to 58% of adults with AD have moderate-to-severe disease (Johansson et al, 2015; 
Egeberg et al, 2017).  AD has a global prevalence ranging from 1 to 20% (Daveiga, 2012); 
approximately 11% of US children and 0.5% of US adults report a diagnosis of AD (Shaw et al, 2011; 
Eckert et al, 2017).   
Most observational studies report a higher prevalence among women than men (Egeberg et al, 2017; 
Thyssen et al, 2017); however, there is no universal consensus on this topic.  AD has similar 
prevalence across racial and ethnic groups (Hanifin & Reed, 2007; Mei-Yen Yong & Tay, 2017), but 
because darker skin may hide erythema, AD may be underdiagnosed among those with darker skin 
tones (Mei-Yen Yong & Tay, 2017).  There is growing appreciation that there are racial differences in 
the clinical presentation (Yew et al, 2018) and immunological polarisation of AD.  For example, Asian 
AD patients show increased epidermal hyperplasia, greater TH17/TH22 and lower TH1 skewing, and 
similar TH2 activation compared with European or European American AD patients (Noda et al, 2015; 
Leung, 2015). Two risk factors appear to be consistently and strongly associated with the development 
of AD: (1) a family history of atopy and (2) the loss of function mutations in the FLG gene. The FLG 
gene encodes pro-filaggrin, which is degraded to filaggrin monomers, and these proteins play key roles 
in the terminal differentiation of the epidermis and formation of the skin barrier, including the stratum 
corneum.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Atopic dermatitis has a complex pathophysiology that is not completely understood. 2 major 
converging components have been described as the pillars of the disease: abnormalities of the 
epidermal structure and function; and cutaneous inflammation due to inappropriate immune responses 
to antigens in the skin (Weidinger & Novak, 2016), also referred as the "inside-out" and "outside-in" 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 10/216 
 
 
 
theories (Guttman-Yassky et al, 2018). Epidermal barrier disruptions and skin inflammation are 
mutually reinforcing processes. 
Perturbations of the epidermal barrier enhance the penetration of allergens to the skin and increases 
the risk of breaking the healthy interaction between the skin and its microbiome, and the likelihood of 
bacterial, viral and fungal skin infections (Werfel et al, 2016). In this context, antigens are presented 
to Langerhans cells and inflammatory epidermal dendritic cells with a high affinity receptor to IgE. This 
antigen presentation promotes the sensitisation of lymphocytes and a T-cell driven immune response. 
Skin inflammation, the other component of the cyclic nature of AD, in the initial acute phase TH2 and 
TH22 responses are augmented with the help of TH17 cells. The mediators produced in this phase 
contribute to the skin barrier disruptions. The activated keratinocytes release chemokines that attract 
T-lymphocytes, and cytokines that mediate the innate immune response, and thus skin inflammation. 
Many of these cytokines signal through the JAK/STAT pathway, importantly those that signal through 
JAK1 homo and heterodimers are: IL-4, IL-13, IL-33, IL-31, IFN-γ, TSLP, and TARC (Schwartz et al, 
2017; Cabanillas et al, 2017). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition characterised by dry, pruritic skin.  
Lesions can affect any part of the body, but distribution and morphology are distinguishably different 
between pediatric and adult populations (Akdis et al, 2006; Weidinger & Novak, 2016; Guttman-Yassky 
et al, 2018).  AD has 3 recognised clinical phases: infant (aged 3-6 months to <2 years), childhood 
(aged 2 to <12 years) and adult (aged 12 years and older) (Akdis et al, 2006). Adolescents and adults 
are grouped together in the adult phase based on the similarity of the clinical pattern and predominant 
areas of AD involvement.  Adolescents and adults often present lichenified and excoriated plaques at 
flexures, wrists, ankles, and periorbital regions; in the head and neck type, the upper trunk, shoulders, 
and scalp are involved.  Adults may have only chronic hand eczema or present with prurigo-like lesions 
(Weidinger & Novak, 2016). 
Diagnosis of AD 
Diagnosis of AD is exclusively reliant on clinical features.  No laboratory finding or histological feature 
is pathognomonic of the disease (D’Erme et al, 2017).  The most used diagnostic criteria are the 
Hanifin and Rajka criteria (1980). Essential features include pruritus and eczematous lesions that can 
be acute, subacute, or chronic.   
2.1.5.  Management 
Optimal control of all aspects of AD, including pruritus, is best achieved through skin hydration and 
restoration of the skin barrier with moisturizing creams, control of skin inflammation and allergen 
avoidance. Many published treatment guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to management.   
The goals of treatment are to reduce symptoms (pruritus and dermatitis), prevent aggravation, and 
minimize therapeutic risks.  
Topical therapies 
1.  Topical corticosteroids, the mainstay of AD therapy, differ in formulation, concentration, and 
potency, which while providing patients with a myriad of options, simultaneously makes their 
reliability and adherence to effective regimens challenging (Vangeli et al, 2015).  Toxicity; both 
systemic (HPA axis suppression) and topical skin dystrophy, thinning and vascular changes

EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 11/216 
 
 
 
additionally limit their continuous use, the need remains to continue to develop corticosteroid-
sparing agents (Del Rosso & Friedlander, 2005).   
2.  Topical calcineurin inhibitors have limited efficacy in moderate-to-severe AD, are not approved 
for use in very young children (<2 years of age) and have practical limitations on amount of 
affected area treated. 
3.  Topical PDE4 inhibitors: Crisaborole has been approved for the management of signs and 
symptoms of mild to moderate AD in major markets. Long-term safety and tolerability of 2% 
crisaborole ointment has been established with a small proportion of patients reporting early onset 
application site pain, and no effects associated with systemic exposure (Hoy, 2017).  
4.  Phototherapy, indicated for moderate to severe AD in some countries, has limited efficacy, is 
inconvenient and impractical for most subjects to use effectively (Weidinger & Novak, 2016; 
Sidbury et al, 2014), and as for other disease states for which phototherapy is used, the risk of 
NMSC and melanoma is a concern, especially in fair-skinned individuals. 
Systemic therapies 
Several drugs are used for the treatment of patients with AD who have failed to respond to topical 
agents and are in need for systemic therapy. Cyclosporine is approved for the treatment of severe AD 
in most European countries, but it is not suitable for long-term use due to toxicities.  Dupilumab is 
approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in the EU.  
1.  Systemic corticosteroids: In clinical practice guidelines, the use of systemic corticosteroids is 
generally discouraged with use limited to special circumstances (Drucker et al, 2018a).  While 
systemic corticosteroids lead to rapid clearing of AD, their side-effect profile and the risk of severe 
rebound flares after discontinuation limit their use to short-course therapy only.  Despite being 
discouraged by most international guidelines, and the inevitable systemic toxicities associated with 
their short- (Waljee et al, 2017) and long- (Rice et al, 2017) term use, approximately 10% of 
patients with AD still use these agents upon flaring (Alexander et al, 2018). 
2.  Dupilumab (Dupixent) which is formulated for subcutaneous injection was originally approved 
for treatment of moderate to severe AD in adult patients, and subsequently received approval also 
for adolescents with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. The product 
has recently received approval for treatment from 6 years of age in subjects with severe AD who 
are candidates for systemic therapy.  
3.  Baricitinib (Olumiant) has recently been approved by the CHMP (EMEA/H/C/004085/II/0016) for 
addition of the new indication “treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients 
who are candidates for systemic therapy”. Baricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of Janus 
kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2. The recommended dose of Olumiant is 4 mg dosed once daily.  
4.  Upadacitinib (Rinvoq), another JAK inhibitor, has also been recently approved by the CHMP 
(EMEA/H/C/004760/X/0006/G) for addition of the new indication ‘treatment of moderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic 
therapy’.  
5.  Tralokinumab (Adtralza) is also approved by the CHMP (EMEA/H/C/005255/0000) for treatment 
of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
6.  Other Systemic Agents (other than Corticosteroids) are used in the treatment of AD. Non-
biologic systemic drugs used for adult AD include cyclosporine, AZA, MMF, and MTX (Simon & 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 12/216 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bieber, 2014). All these agents are used off label, except for cyclosporine, which is licensed and 
approved for short-term treatment of severe refractory AD in many EU countries (Ring et al, 
2012b). 
7.  Oral antihistamines: These have been used in the management of pruritus in AD patients in an 
effort to improve their quality of life by inhibiting the vascular and neurologic effects of the “itch-
scratch cycle,” but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the general use of antihistamines 
as part of the treatment of AD (Ring et al, 2012a). 
2.2.  About the product 
Abrocitinib is an orally bioavailable small molecule that reversibly and selectively inhibits Janus kinase 
(JAK) 1 by blocking the ATP binding site.

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The chemical name of abrocitinib is N-((1S,3S)-3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-
yl)amino)cyclobutyl)propane-1-sulfonamide corresponding to the molecular formula C14H21N5O2S. It 
has a relative molecular mass of 323.42 Daltons and the following structure depicted in Figure 1: 
Figure 1 Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of abrocitinib was elucidated by a combination of UV/VIS and IR spectroscopy, 
mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. 
The active substance is a white to pale-purple or pale pink crystalline powder. It is non-hygroscopic 
and its solubility is pH dependent.  Abrocitinib is classified as BCS Class II. The impact of particle size 
on finished product uniformity of dosage units and dissolution has been studied (see finished product 
section). Based on the abrocitinib finished product biopharmaceutics performance, stability, and 
manufacturing experience, the active substance particle size specification was established. 
Abrocitinib is an achiral molecule, but with 2 stereocentres.  
Only one crystalline anhydrous form (Form 1) of abrocitinib has been identified. This form has been the 
only form used in all toxicology and clinical studies. Extensive polymorph and hydrate screening have 
been conducted to investigate if additional solid forms of abrocitinib could be discovered.  Abrocitinib, 
Form 1 was the only anhydrous crystalline form identified from these studies. No new anhydrous 
polymorphs, hydrates or amorphous solids of abrocitinib were isolated from these screens. 
Experiments with 1,4 dioxane and dimethyl sulfoxide yielded solvated forms of abrocitinib. When these 
solvated structures were subjected to high temperature, these materials desolvated and converted to 
Form 1, free base anhydrous form of abrocitinib. However, these are not relevant since the commercial 
crystallisation step does not utilise either of these solvent systems. 
It has been confirmed that the manufacturing process consistently yields polymorphic form I. This form 
is physically and chemically stable under normal manufacturing and storage conditions as well as 
under accelerated conditions. Hence the absence of control of form I is justified. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The commercial active substance abrocitinib will be manufactured by Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, 
Ringaskiddy, Ireland. The development and clinical batch manufacture have been performed by Pfizer’s 
site in Sandwich, Kent, UK.   
The synthesis of abrocitinib consists of a five-step manufacturing process including three covalent bond 
forming manufacturing steps.  
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 14/216 
 
 
 
 
Materials used in the manufacture of the active substance (reagents, solvents and auxiliary materials) 
are listed including information where each material is used. Specifications for these materials are 
provided. No catalysts are used in the synthesis. 
One of the starting materials proposed by the applicant (SM1) was not deemed acceptable by the 
CHMP, being a custom synthesised chemical and considered as an intermediate. The applicant was 
requested to redefine this starting material (Major Objection) so that the introduction of the 
stereocentres and the control of stereoisomeric impurities are performed under GMP. In order to 
address the CHMP concerns and increase the number of chemical transformation steps performed 
under GMP, to mitigate risks associated with contamination and future changes, the applicant 
redefined that starting materials an intermediate and proposed earlier as the new starting materials. 
This was accepted by the CHMP.  
Other of the original proposed starting materials, SM2, is a commercially available chemical that is 
incorporated in abrocitinib. It is widely used in non-pharmaceutical commercial applications. However, 
it is included in the last step of the synthesis and the synthesis route of this material was not described 
in the original submission. The CHMP was concerned about the regulatory oversight of the control 
strategy for impurities and thus raised a MO asking the applicant to address this. In the response, the 
applicant discussed the route of synthesis and reagents used by all three suppliers of this starting 
material. Impurities that are structurally similar to SM2 can react to form impurities that may carry 
through into the active substance.  Those impurities have been included on the specification for the 
starting material and detailed fate and purge studies performed demonstrating an extensive purge. 
Based on the additional information provided it is concluded that SM2 is adequately controlled and is 
an appropriate starting material for the synthesis of abrocitinib. 
The isolation strategy was developed based on the physical properties of each intermediate and the 
knowledge of impurity generation and subsequent purge. Isolations provide multiple opportunities for 
the removal of reaction by-products and impurities. The control strategy and their specifications have 
been adequately justified. 
Overall, the manufacturing process of the abrocitinib, the control of materials and intermediates and 
the control strategy has been described and justified by the applicant. 
The current commercial batch size has been defined (typical final output range).  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Several impurities are associated with the manufacturing process. The origin and fate have been 
discussed for each of them.  
The applicant proposes ICH M7 option 4 control strategy for some identified mutagenic impurities. 
These limits are considered acceptable.   
Two synthetic pathways were employed for the manufacture of abrocitinib during clinical development. 
Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The active substance is packaged in and stored in double sealed low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags 
stored in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drum or equivalent secondary container. A declaration of 
conformity of the primary packaging to Ph.Eur. 3.1.4 and EU regulation 10/2011 incl. amendments has 
been provided.

2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identity (LC, IR), particle size 
(laser diffraction), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), and residual 
solvents (HS-GC). 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA). 
The CQA identified are particle size, organic impurities, inorganic impurities and residual solvents. 
Abrocitinib is classified as BCS Class II. The impact of particle size on finished product uniformity of 
dosage units, manufacturability, bioavailability, and dissolution has been studied (see finished product 
section). The particle size specification has been established based on the abrocitinib finished product 
biopharmaceutics performance, stability, and manufacturing experience. 
The origin and fate of the specified impurities, which are classified as ICH M7 Class 5 impurities, have 
been discussed. Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A 
were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Adequate justifications have been provided for the omission of tests. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and system suitability testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 35 batches of the active substance used for toxicology, development and 
stability studies and for the manufacture of finished product for clinical studies and registration stability 
have been presented. 17 batches were manufactured using the commercial process. These batches 
include 3 batches produced at the site of commercial manufacture, Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals in 
Ringaskiddy, County Cork, Ireland, which were provided during the procedure to address a MO. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of active substance manufactured at Pfizer, Sandwich, UK 
using the commercial process stored in the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under 
long term conditions (30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Samples were evaluated for appearance, assay, degradation products, water content, solid form, 
particle size, and microbial quality (TAMC/TYMC). The analytical methods used in the primary stability 
programme are the same as the release methods. The additional methods have been described. 
No changes in any of the studied attributes were noted. All tested parameters were within the 
specifications. No change was observed due to storage conditions.  
In addition, photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay and achiral purity. 
The active substance did not show any instabilities due to light (ICH Q1B conditions). Therefore, it was 
concluded that abrocitinib is not light sensitive and does not require protection from light. 
Samples of abrocitinib were subjected to forced degradation conditions (acid; base; light exposure; 
oxidation; and heat) to confirm the suitability of the assay and purity method and to identify potential 
primary degradation products. Samples were analysed for assay and purity. The results showed that 
abrocitinib is not sensitive to water, acidic, basic, metal ion, thermal thermal/humidity or light

degradation. Abrocitinib is shown to degrade under oxidative conditions. The results confirm that the 
HPLC assay and purity method for abrocitinib active substance is specific, selective, and stability-
indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months stored at or 
below 30°C conditions in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets. The tablets are available in 
three strengths: 50, 100 and 200 mg. These are differentiated by their shape and/or debossing codes. 
The 50 mg tablets are oval, pink film-coated tablets debossed with “PFE” on one side and “ABR 50” on 
the other side. The 100 mg tablets are round, pink film-coated tablets debossed with “PFE” on one side 
and “ABR 100” on the other side. The 200 mg tablets are oval, pink film-coated tablets debossed with 
“PFE” on one side and “ABR 200” on the other side.  
The strengths are quantitatively proportional. The maximum dose of 200 mg does not fully dissolve in 
250 mL of medium at equilibrium over the entire physiological pH range (1 to 7.5). Additionally, 
analysis of clinical study B7451008 showed total absorption of abrocitinib is greater than 85%. The 
active substance is classified as a BCS Class II compound (i.e., low solubility and high permeability). 
The impact of active substance particle size was an important consideration during finished product 
development.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The choice of the 
excipients has been justified. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.  
The formulation is composed of microcrystalline cellulose and dibasic calcium phosphate, anhydrous 
(diluents), sodium starch glycolate (disintegrant), and magnesium stearate (lubricant). Tablet cores 
are subsequently film-coated with a non-functional HPMC/ lactose based Opadry II® formulation. The 
functionality-related characteristics of the excipients and their controls have been discussed and 
adequate specifications have been established. The amount of excipients used in the composition has 
been properly justified by different studies performed during the development. These included studies 
to optimise and evaluate the impact of formulation on finished product manufacturing and 
performance. 
The applicant has described the pharmaceutical development in detail and has justified the proposed 
formulation and the manufacturing process.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the abrocitinib tablet core uses a direct compression, 
continuous manufacturing (CM) platform developed by the applicant. The platform, named Pfizer’s 
Portable, Continuous, Miniature and Modular (PCMM), has been approved previously in EU for the 
manufacture of other medicinal product from Pfizer, Daurismo.  
The CM process involves three primary functions which are (1) continuous feeding and (2) continuous 
mixing to form a blend, followed by (3) tablet compression using a conventional rotary tablet press. 
The final unit operation is a film-coating process, which is performed as a batch process using 
conventional equipment.  
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 17/216 
 
 
 
Studies have been performed to evaluate the impact of excipients on finished product manufacturing 
and performance including continuous feeding accuracy and variability, continuous mixing residence 
time distribution, blend uniformity, compression tablet hardness, disintegration, stability and 
dissolution.  
A combination of risk-based assessments, laboratory studies, computational models, and 
manufacturing experience has resulted in a comprehensive understanding of the formulation and 
process conditions and their impact on the quality attributes (e.g., potency, purity, dissolution, 
uniformity of dosage units, and appearance) of the product.  
An understanding of the relationships between formulation inputs and process parameters on the 
critical quality attributes and process dynamics of the commercial formulation and manufacturing 
process for abrocitinib film-coated tablets has been established. The process understanding developed 
for each integrated unit operation was used to define the manufacturing process. 
A structured, quality risk management approach was employed to identify potentially critical material 
attributes and process parameters and assess their impact on critical quality attributes and process 
dynamics of the finished product. This risk assessment was performed based upon prior knowledge as 
well as the knowledge gained throughout the development of the manufacturing process. 
For the formulation development, a material risk assessment has been provided. The impact of 
abrocitinib active substance and excipients on continuous feeding accuracy and variability, continuous 
mixing residence time distribution, blend uniformity, tablet hardness, disintegration, dissolution and 
stability was evaluated. Based on this risk assessment, the components with the highest potential to 
impact product quality attributes are the active substance (abrocitinib), the disintegrant (sodium starch 
glycolate) and the lubricant (magnesium stearate).  
With regards to the manufacturing process development, summaries of multivariate studies performed 
on gravimetric feeders, continuous mixing and the continuous tablet press have been presented. These 
studies were designed to understand the impact of material properties and process parameters on 
dosage form quality attributes, such as potency, content uniformity, dissolution and tablet physical 
properties. Process parameters are controlled within operating ranges as defined in the manufacturing 
process description or through the use of in-process controls (IPCs). The abrocitinib film-coated tablet 
manufacturing process has been shown to be robust within the target and operating ranges.  
Residence time distribution, process monitoring, traceability, segregation (blend uniformity), state of 
control and other elements of CM were also studied. 
An integrated control strategy comprising material attributes and process parameters, finished product 
specifications, IPCs, as well as real time monitoring using PAT (near infrared – hybrid soft sensor 
method), steady state operation and diversion criteria for non-conforming product has been developed.  
The in-line near-infrared (NIR) probe is inserted into the top of the feed frame immediately before 
tablet compression to continuously monitor the blend concentration and allow for potential diversion of 
tablet cores made from non-conforming blend. Sufficient information has been provided on the NIR 
method. Equivalence with the reference method (i.e. off-line testing with HPLC reference product) has 
been shown. 
Information on the equipment design and configuration including the impact on the process 
performance has been provided by the applicant. Among these, a residence time distribution (RTD) 
model, referred to as the Mass Balance Model, is incorporated into the PCMM control and automation 
system to calculate the concentration of each formulation component in the exit stream of the 
continuous mixer (CMT), as a function of time to ensure robust control of the continuous mixing 
process.

The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing, except for the 
film-coating which was white instead of pink. This change is considered acceptable. The phase 3 
product was manufactured in the same way as the proposed 100 mg tablet with PCMM continuous 
manufacturing direct compression process and then film-coated.  
Doses of 100 and 200 mg were administered with one or two 100 mg tablets, respectively during 
Phase 3 studies. A bioequivalence study has shown that two 100 mg phase tablets are equivalent to 
one 200 mg commercial tablet. The biowaiver to the two lower strengths, 50 and 100 mg tablets is 
considered acceptable from a pharmaceutical point of view based on: 
- The three strengths are proportionally similar in their active and inactive ingredients 
(common blend). 
- Data show similarity in dissolution profiles between 50, 100, and 200 mg abrocitinib film-
coated tablets in three different pH media (pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8) and the proposed 
commercial dissolution method at pH 3.5. Overlapping dissolution profiles are presented as 
exemplified below.  
- Dose proportional pharmacokinetics across the dose range from 30 mg to 400 mg (see 
pharmacokinetics section).  
The development of the dissolution method used for quality control and comparison of batches has 
been described. The type of vessels, agitation rate and the media selection have been adequately 
investigated, optimised and hence are considered justified as they are needed to have a robust 
dissolution method that minimises sensitivity to hydrodynamics and maintain sink conditions. 
Several parameters have been adjusted to achieve a discriminative method. The discriminatory power 
of the dissolution method has been demonstrated by testing variant tablet formulations  
The primary packaging is a HDPE bottle with polypropylene closure, or unit dose PVDC blister with an 
aluminium foil lidding. The primary packaging materials comply with Commission Regulation (EU) No 
10/2011. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The abrocitinib film-coated tablets are manufactured at Pfizer Manufacturing Deutschland GmbH, 
Mooswaldallee 1, 79090 Freiburg, Germany. This manufacturing site performs all stages in the 
manufacture including finished product manufacture, QC testing, primary and secondary packaging 
and EEA batch release. 
As indicated above, the tablets are manufactured using Pfizer’s PCMM manufacturing platform via 
direct compression from a common blend. The manufacturing process consist of three main steps: 
mixing, compression and film-coating. The mixing (including feeding) and compression steps are 
performed in a CM process whereas the film-coating and following packaging are performed as 
standard batch manufacturing.  
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail in the dossier based on the 
manufacturing process development studies. The batch size is determined by the amount of in-coming 
raw materials to manufacture a predetermined amount of tablet cores. The proposed commercial batch 
size has been defined. 
The continuous feeders and continuous mixer are operated to deliver material to the tablet press at the 
defined total mass throughput rate. 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 19/216 
 
 
 
Start up and shut down processes, as well as strategy for controlled process pause that may be 
required following process events that can occur during routine manufacture, and the strategy for 
material diversion have been described. 
The product diversion duration has been defined.  
Details on the IPCs, during primary mode and contingency mode have been provided. The methods 
have been sufficiently validated and shown to give similar results. The information provided on the NIR 
method proposed as an IPC test of blend potency of abrocitinib tablet cores is found to be in line with 
“Guideline on the use of near infrared spectroscopy by the pharmaceutical industry and the data 
requirements for new submissions and variations (EMEA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/17760/2009 Rev2)”. A post 
approval change management protocol (PACMP) has been presented for planned changes to the NIR 
IPC method and model maintenance. This is acceptable. 
Although the manufacturer has experience from one previously approved product with the PCMM 
continuous manufacturing platform, the manufacturing process is still to be considered non-standard 
and process validation results has therefore been presented for three batches of each strength 
manufactured on commercial scale at the proposed manufacturing site, Freiburg, Germany.  
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release specifications, include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
appearance (visual) identification (LC retention time and UV spectra), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units by weight variation (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits: 
TAMC, TYMC, E. coli (Ph. Eur.) 
The finished product specification includes relevant tests to ensure the quality of the film-coated 
tablets and the proposed limits are justified.   
The limits proposed for related substances have been set in accordance with ICH guidelines and are 
considered acceptable. 
The limit proposed for the dissolution method has been justified. The proposed limit is acceptable.  
A justification for not controlling water content and elemental in the release specification has been 
presented and is acceptable. 
The water content results showed some analytical variability and in general an increase is expected on 
storage with larger increases observed at higher humidity storage. A correlation analysis was 
performed water content did not have a strong correlation with assay, degradation products or 
dissolution. 
An elemental impurities risk assessment ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities (EI) was 
performed on the finished product. The risk assessment was conducted on the 200 mg tablets which 
represent the worst case among the 3 strengths. The in-going active substance, excipients, 
manufacturing equipment and utilities, and packaging components were evaluated as part of the risk-
assessment. These assessments showed that the risk of the Class 1 and Class 2A EIs exceeding the 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 20/216 
 
 
 
 
30% control threshold of the Option 2a concentration limits and associated oral PDEs were low to 
negligible.  
To confirm the findings of the risk assessment, three batches of abrocitinib immediate release film 
coated 200 mg tablets manufactured according to the commercial process were screened for EIs 
identified during the risk assessments using a validated ICP-MS method. No individual Class 1 and 
Class 2A elemental impurities were observed at or above their Option 2a oral concentration limits in 
the finished product. The individual Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities were all below the 30% 
Control Threshold values, with respect to their individual oral PDEs and/or concentration limits. 
Based on the risk assessment confirmatory data collected it can be concluded that it is not necessary 
to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
To address two MOs raised during the procedure, the applicant has presented a risk assessment of the 
active substance and finished product for the potential presence of N-nitrosamines considering all 
suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). A negligible amount of potential N-nitrosamines is estimated 
to be present in the active substance In the finished product one N-nitrosamine has the potential to be 
formed when combining nitrites from the excipients with a secondary amine degradation product. The 
amount of this N-nitrosamine potentially formed in the finished product over time is estimated to be 
<20 ppb using conservative, worst-case-scenario assumptions. This amount is well below the proposed 
acceptable intake and the approach to not test for this N-nitrosamine is considered acceptable. Overall, 
based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional 
control measures are deemed necessary.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the abrocitinib reference 
standard has been presented. 
Batch analysis data is presented for 3 batches of 200 mg tablets and 26 batches of 100 mg tablets and 
7 batches of 50 mg tablets manufactured by the Pfizer site at Groton, USA. In addition, data for one 
100 mg batch designated for clinical use and one technical batch of 200 mg tablets are presented from 
the proposed manufacturing site, Pfizer, Freiburg. All batch analysis data comply with the specification 
set at the time of analysis, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three batches of finished product from each strength manufactured in Groton CT, 
USA at greater than 10% commercial scale stored for up to 12 months (50 mg strength) or 18 months 
(100 mg and 200 mg strengths) under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH and 30ºC /75% RH) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The batches of Cibinqo are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products and dissolution. Water content, 
water activity and microbiological quality were tested for information only. The analytical procedures 
used are stability indicating.  
Tablets met the appearance acceptance criteria except the 12-month 100 mg and 200 mg 5-count 
HDPE bottle and blister samples stored at 30ºC /75% RH, where faint surface cracking was observed. 
However, investigation revealed no cracks on the tablets upon removal from the package and 
immediate inspection. Faint surface cracking did not occur in any of the samples that were stored at 
25ºC /60% RH. The faint surface cracking is cosmetic and has been determined to not extend beyond 
the film-coat surface. All other attributes tested on stability meet the acceptance criteria and no 
meaningful trends were observed. 
The water content and water activity results showed some analytical variability and in general an 
increase on storage with larger increases observed at higher humidity storage, but they did not 
adversely impact stability, quality or performance of the finished product as measured by assay, 
degradation products or dissolution. 
Forced degradation experiments under heat; humidity; light exposure and oxidation conditions were 
performed on 100 mg abrocitinib film-coated tablets to establish the extent and nature of potential 
degradation pathways and to confirm the suitability of the assay and purity method. Samples were 
analysed for potency and degradation products. The liquid chromatographic assay and purity method 
for abrocitinib immediate release film-coated tablets was shown to be specific, selective and stability-
indicating. 
In addition, a photostability study was carried out according to the ICH Guideline Q1B on photostability 
testing of new drug substances and products, option 2. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, 
degradation products, water content (for information only) and water activity (for information only). 
The 50 mg samples were also tested for dissolution. No significant changes were observed in any of 
the parameters measured for the confirmatory photostability study for samples directly exposed to 
light with the exception of increases in water content which is expected in exposed unpackaged 
samples. Therefore, it is concluded that abrocitinib film-coated tablets are stable to light and no 
precautionary packaging or labelling is required. 
Packaged samples were also exposed. Slight yellowing of the PVC/PVDC blister film was observed for 
exposed 50 mg supplies. The discoloration has no significant influence on the characteristic physical 
properties or functionality of the package, and it is not related to abrocitinib tablet quality or 
performance. 
An in-use open bottle study was carried out on one batch of each strength (HDPE bottle, 30 count). 
The bottles were opened, and the cap and seal were removed. The bottles were stored open to the 
30ºC /75% RH environment with a dust cover. The in-use study for the 50 mg strength was updated 
prior to the 12 months testing to include both long term storage conditions (25ºC / 60% RH and 30ºC 
/75% RH) and to better simulate actual patient use. The 50 mg bottles were opened and closed 30 
times over the 45 days exposure to simulate a patient removing tablets. 
Samples are tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content and water 
activity. Results for the in-use samples were comparable to the 3 month or 12 month, unopened, 30ºC 
/75% RH sample of the same lot with the exceptions noted below, similar observations were made for 
25ºC / 60% RH in-use samples tested at 12 months. As expected, water content and water activity 
increased with exposure to the 30ºC /75% RH storage environment. The increase in water did not 
adversely impact stability, quality or performance of the finished product as measured by assay, 
degradation products or dissolution. Assay, degradation products and dissolution results met the 
acceptance criteria. Faint surface cracking was observed in appearance testing of the 100 and 200 mg, 
Assessment report - Cibinqo

12 month in-use samples stored at 30ºC / 75% RH. However, similar to the finding in the long-term 
stability studies, the investigation revealed no cracks on the tablets upon removal from the package 
and immediate inspection. Faint surface cracking developed after tablets experienced a rapid change 
from high humidity in the package to low humidity in the laboratory condition. As mentioned above, 
the faint surface cracking is cosmetic and has been determined to not extend beyond the film-coat 
surface. All other attributes tested met the acceptance criteria.  
As a result of the faint surface cracking observation, additional in-use studies were conducted on 100 
mg and 200 mg samples stored at 25ºC / 60% RH and 30ºC /75% RH to simulate more realistic actual 
patient use. The results are consistent with the 12-month primary stability and 12-month in-use 
sample results except for the in-use appearance observations. No film-coat cracking was observed in 
any of the additional in-use study samples). The data confirm the finding of the investigation and 
hence it gives reassurance that crackling of the surface will not occur during use and it does not need 
to be reflected in the SmPC. As expected, water content and water activity increase with in-use 
storage but the increase does not impact the stability, quality or performance of the finished product. 
All testing met the acceptance criteria. 
In addition, one lot of each strength stored in the 30-count HDPE bottle, were challenged to two 
separate storage condition studies, a thermal cycle study (two cycles of storage at 40ºC / 75% RH and 
-20ºC) and a short-term accelerated exposure study at 50ºC / 75% RH. Samples were tested for 
appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content and water activity. The 
appearance, assay, degradation products and dissolution performance of the abrocitinib film-coated 
tablet lots remained essentially unchanged through both the thermal cycle study and the 3-day 50ºC / 
75% RH exposure. There were no reportable degradation products. These data are supportive of minor 
shipping excursions for the abrocitinib film-coated tablets. 
Based on 18 months stability data for 100 and 200 mg batches and 12 months stability data for 50 mg 
batches from the primary stability programme, the proposed shelf-life is 30 months for 100 and 200 
mg abrocitinib film-coated tablets and 2 years for 50 mg abrocitnib film-coated tablets when stored 
when stored in PVDC blister with aluminum foil lidding or HDPE bottles with polypropylene closure with 
induction seal liners as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), is acceptable. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the EMA.

composition. Several MO were raised during the evaluation of this application. These pertained to the 
redefinition and justification of the proposed starting materials, the lack of batch analysis data from the 
proposed commercial active substance manufacturer, missing process validation on the finished 
product from the proposed commercial manufacturing site and the nitrosamines risk evaluation. All 
raised issues were satisfactorily addressed by the applicant. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Abrocitinib (also referred to as PF-04965842) is an orally bioavailable Janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor 
indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Three 
circulating metabolites (M1 [PF-06471658], M2 [PF-07055087], and M4 [PF-07054874]) were profiled 
in pharmacological, ADME, and in vitro safety pharmacology studies. 
The pivotal toxicology and safety pharmacology studies were conducted in accordance with GLP 
regulations and ICH guidelines. 
CHMP scientific advices have been given to the non-clinical development of abrocitinib (see Section 1). 
The given advices have been in general followed. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacology was assessed by evaluating the potency, and selectivity of abrocitinib in the 
in vitro assays using purified kinase domains from the JAK family of kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and 
TYK2), and in assays against a broad kinome panel. 
In Vitro biochemical assays 
In vitro activity in the biochemical assay of abrocitinib was analysed against the four JAK family 
members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) using Caliper mobility shift assay. Fluorescent labelled 
synthetic peptides were used as substrates for recombinant enzymes and the enzymatic activity were 
analysed by Caliper Life Science Lab Chip 3000 (LC3000) instrument. The potency of the main 
metabolites was analysed against the JAK family members using the same method. Potency was 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 24/216 
 
 
 
estimated in the presence of an ATP concentration of 1 mM, as well as the apparent Km for ATP for 
each enzyme where the ATP concentration of 1 mM is the more clinically relevant. 
The IC50 of abrocitinib in the biochemical assay was 29.2 nM (JAK1), 803 nM (JAK2), >10000 nM 
(JAK3) and 1250 nM (TYK2), i.e. abrocitinib had a 28-fold higher selectivity for JAK1 compared to JAK2 
in the biochemical assay and the corresponding figures for JAK3 and TYK2 were >342 and 43 nM, 
respectively, in the presence of 1 mM ATP. In the presence of the apparent Km for ATP in each 
enzymatic reaction, the selectivity was 9.3, 151 and 16.5-fold higher for JAK1 compared to JAK2, JAK3 
and TYK2, respectively. According to the biochemical assay settings, abrocitinib appears to be rather 
selective against JAK1 compared to the other JAK family members. However, in a cellular setting, upon 
stimulation by divergent cytokine stimuli, the response will be dependent on JAK signalling pairs, 
meaning that inhibition of JAK1 will affect pathways mediated by other JAK family members as well. 
Hence, the relevance of selective enzymatic inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to clinical effect is 
currently not known. 
The metabolites, M1, M2 and M3 had a similar potency on the JAK family members as abrocitinib and 
thus, may contribute to the overall pharmacology. The metabolite M4 was shown to be inactive on all 
JAK family members.  
The rat and cynomolgus monkey were selected for investigation of the safety pharmacology and 
toxicity studies. Pharmacological efficacy has been proven in a study on AIA rat, symptomatically by 
dose dependent reduction of paw swelling and functionally by inhibition of STAT phosphorylation in ex 
vivo samples. In vitro data on the inhibition by abrocitinib regarding cytokine signalling in whole blood 
from cynomolgus monkey and rat for comparison to previously provided human data has been 
submitted. For this evaluation, the cytokines IL-15 (Jak1/Jak3), IL-12 (Jak2/Tyk2) and interferon-α 
(Jak1/Tyk2) were chosen for stimulation of whole blood. The results show the following inhibitory 
pattern using IC50 after stimulation by IL-15: 480/537; IL-12: 2660/9730; interferon-α: 362/183 for 
cynomolgus monkey and human, respectively. The corresponding figures for IC50 in rat are for 
stimulation by IL-15: 87.9; IL-12: 4090; interferon-α: 112. Thus, the activity by abrocitinib on the JAK 
family members is sufficient for the selected safety pharmacology/toxicity species. 
In vitro human whole blood and other cellular assays 
The inhibitory potency by abrocitinib was studied in various human cell types such as PMBC (cultured 
or analysed in whole blood), keratinocytes, CD34+ progenitor cells as well as cell lines (THP-1 and 
HT29). The cells where simulated with a number of different interleukins, IFNα, IFNγ, TSLP or EPO, all 
known to induce JAK mediated phosphorylation of STAT(s). The metabolites (M1-4) as well as other 
compounds, were compared to abrocitinib in the assays.  
Inhibitory activity of abrocitinib in cultured human PMBCs and CD34+ progenitor cells showed highest 
affinity to signalling pairs involving JAK1 compared to those not involving JAK1 such as JAK2/TYK2 and 
JAK2/JAK2. Abrocitinib inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 in lymphocytes mediated by 
signalling pairs involving JAK1 with an IC50 of 32.5-142 nM (stimulated by IFNα, IL-15, IL-10, IL-27).  
For JAK2/JAK2 signalling pairs stimulated by EPO on CD34+progenitor cells and JAK2/TYK2 signalling 
pairs stimulated by IL-23 on PMBC, the IC50 was 794 and 2130 nM, respectively.  
In addition, the IC50 was estimated for abrocitinib using whole blood as a source of PMBC. The 
potency of abrocitinib was lower in whole blood PMBC (i.e. lymphocytes) compared to cultured PMBC. 
For the signalling pairs involving JAK1, abrocitinib inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 with 
an IC50 of 174-576 nM (also stimulated by IFNα, IL-15, IL-10, IL-27 on lymphocytes). In the whole 
blood analyses, signalling pairs involving JAK1 were additionally stimulated by IFNγ (of lymphocytes 
and CD14+ cells), IL-6 (of CD3+ and CD14+ cells) and IL-21 (of lymphocytes) and abrocitinib 
inhibited STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation with an IC50 of 164-1690 nM. Abrocitinib had a 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 25/216 
 
 
 
low/negligible potency on the JAK1 independent pathways. Induction of STAT3 and STAT4 
phosphorylation by IL-12 and IL-23 stimulation of lymphocytes mediated by the signalling pairs 
JAK2/TYK2, showed an IC50 of 9730 and <16500 nM respectively, and EPO induced STAT5 
phosphorylation mediated by JAK2/JAK2 signalling pair in whole blood, 7180 nM. STAT phosphorylation 
by the metabolites M1, M2 and M3 was tested in human whole blood and CD34+ cells (stimulated by 
IFNα, IFNγ, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21, IL-23, IL-27 and EPO). All metabolites were shown to be 
of pharmacological relevance without higher specificity of importance for other JAK members than 
abrocitinib. M3 had a lower potency than M1 and M2 in most cases. The IC50 for STAT phosphorylation 
mediated by JAK signalling pairs where JAK1 was involved, varied between 90.5-4840 nM and for the 
signalling pairs JAK2/JAK2 or JAK2/TYK2, between 5170-33400 nM.  
Abrocitinib was compared to other inhibitors possessing high affinity to other members in the JAK 
family in whole blood and a variety of cell types. Abrocitinib exhibited a good inhibitory potency on 
various cell-types known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of dermal conditions such as AD. IL-4 
induced STAT6 phosphorylation mediated by JAK1/(JAK3) in B-cells, T-cells and monocytes from 
human whole blood as well as primary keratinocytes and HT-29, and was inhibited by abrocitinib with 
an IC50 of 77-503 nM. Inhibition of IL-13 stimulated STAT6 phosphorylation in B-cells and monocytes 
from human whole blood had an IC50 of 285-351 nM while in HT-29 and keratinocytes the 
corresponding figures were 11 and 81.9 nM, respectively. IL-22 induced STAT3 phosphorylation 
(mediated by JAK1/TYK2) in primary epithelial cells and keratinocytes showed an IC50 of 1243 and 
420 nM, respectively, and of IL-31 stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in THP-1 cells, 40 nM.  
The potency of metabolites M1 and M2 showed an equal pharmacological relevance after stimulation by 
IL-4, IL-13, IL, 22, IL-31 in the above-mentioned situations. 
Thymic Stromal lymphopoetin (TSLP) is linked to multiple allergic diseases, such as the pathogenesis 
of  AD. Inhibition by abrocitinib and the metabolites (M1 and M2) in TSLP-stimulated STAT5 
phosphorylation in CD3+ T-(killer) cells from whole blood had an IC50 of 1021, 785 and 271 nM, 
respectively.  
In vitro activity of JAK inhibition in functional settings in human cellular assays 
Differentiation of human bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells to platelet producing megakaryocytes is 
dependent on stimulation by many factors, including thrombopoietin (TPO) and IL-6. Abrocitinib 
exhibited a dose dependent inhibition of TPO induced STAT5 (IC50 = 1060nM) and IL-6 induced STAT3 
phosphorylation (IC50 = 83.7 nM) in human bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells. When further 
analysed with regard to development of CD34+ progenitor cells to CD41a cells (marker typically 
associated with megakaryocytic commitment), the inhibitory potency was shown to be dose dependent 
with an IC50 of 5670 nM. This pathway is assumed to be a TPO and IL-6 induced JAK2 dependent 
pathway. However, patients with a current or past medical history of conditions associated with 
thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy or platelet dysfunction as well as patients receiving anti-coagulants or 
medications known to cause thrombocytopenia have been excluded from the clinical trials as a 
precaution. The importance of these inhibitory effects by abrocitinib on TPO and IL-6 induced STAT 
phosphorylation in a clinical setting have not been discussed by the applicant and is therefore 
unknown. This lack of knowledge with regard to thrombopoiesis is accepted provided that it is clearly 
reflected in the SmPC. 
TPO is also the primary regulator of platelet function and circulating levels are cleared after binding to 
the MPL receptor (cellular homologue of the myeloproliferative leukaemia virus oncogene) on the 
circulating platelets and megakaryocytes in bone marrow. This event is assumed to be partly mediated 
via JAK2. TPO clearance was further investigated and abrocitinib showed a weak dose dependent 
inhibition of internalisation of TPO in platelets with an IC50 of 10800 nM, and 4970 nM unbound (the 
IC50 of abrocitinib potency for JAK2 is 803 nM in biochemical assay). Baricitinib, a JAK2 inhibitor, was

EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 26/216 
 
 
 
also tested in this experiment, however, Baricitinib only inhibited 10% of the TPO clearance, 
nevertheless, with an IC50 of 22 nM. This suggests an alternatively mediated internalisation of TPO 
into platelets.  
In vivo study on adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) rat model 
The anti-inflammatory effect of abrocitinib was investigated in the AIA rat model in two studies 
(experiment 1; 50, 15, and 5 mg/kg and experiment 2; 15, 5, 1, and 0.5 mg/kg) PO daily for seven 
days. Abrocitinib treatment resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of paw swelling (disease severity) 
in the rats after seven days of treatment which was significant for the dose levels between 5-50 
mg/kg. In addition, ex vivo samples showed dose dependent inhibition of STAT phosphorylation in IL-
6, IL-21, IFNγ and IFNα stimulated T-cells as well as GM-CSF stimulated monocytes (samples drawn at 
15 minutes after dosing). The mean plasma concentrations in animals dosed with abrocitinib 15 
minutes post-dosing (Cmax) were 1082, 4947, 26901 nM for 0.5, 5 and 15 mg/kg dose level and at 24 
hours, 2.49, 7.24, and 139 nM, respectively. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacology was assessed by evaluating the binding potency of abrocitinib against a 
broad panel of receptors, transporters, enzymes, and ion channels in vitro. Follow-up KDR kinase 
(VEGFR2), MAO-A, and MAO-B functional assays were conducted. 
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are suggested to be contributors in the pathogenesis of systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE), and pDC’s are thought to become insensitive to the cell killing by 
glucocorticoids in an SLE setting. The applicant presented data, showing that purified pDC’s are fairly 
easily killed in the presence of prednisolone in a dose dependent manner, however, in the presence of 
serum from SLE patients, pDC exhibits a reduced sensitivity to prednisolone. This insensitivity to 
steroid killing was reversed in the presence of 1 µM abrocitinib. Prednisolone concentration needed for 
50% cell killing was 0.099 µM for control serum, 1.005 µM for SLE serum and 0.055 µM for SLE serum 
in the presence of 1 µM abrocitinib. However, the results from this pilot study are based on one donor 
of pDC only. In an additional study, abrocitinib inhibited type I interferon (IFN) induced gene 
expression in normal PMBC, stimulated with SLE immune complexes (IC). The expression of the three 
SLE-related genes, RSAD2, USP18 and GBP1, was inhibited with an IC50 (mean ± SD) of 82 ± 95, 114 
± 132 and 107 ± 120 nM, respectively, from five healthy PMBC donors. 
Selectivity of abrocitinib was also tested against a panel comprising 40 kinases in the presence of the 
apparent Km for ATP for each enzyme. The highest selectivity of abrocitinib in the panel was against 
JAK3, showing an inhibition of 60.6%, which was equivalent to the inhibition of JAK3 in presence of 
apparent Km for ATP, revealing an IC50 of 493 nM. The apparent Km for ATP should result in a higher 
affinity of abrocitinib to other kinases compared with in the presence of 1 mM ATP. For testing the 
selectivity against other kinases, this approach is acceptable.  
A broad ligand binding assay of abrocitinib in a concentration of 10 µM in all assays was performed. 
Abrocitinib inhibited VEGFR2 with 93.8% with an IC50 of 1.2 µM, and MAOA with 67% and IC50 of 6 
µM. This corresponds to a marginal to human exposure of x 1 for VEGFR and x 4.8 for MAOA of the 
unbound clinical Cmax of 1.25 µM at a clinical dose of 200 mg. Further investigations were performed 
in order to assess the functional meaning of these results; VEGFR phosphorylation was assessed in 
KDR-transfected PAE cells and it was shown that abrocitinib had no effect on the VEGFR kinase activity 
up to the highest tested concentration, 30 µM. The applicant referred to a study by Ryan et al., 1999 
where cynomolgus monkeys were administrated with a selective VEGF inhibitor and that events 
associated with VEGF inhibition, such as physeal dysplasia, did not occur in the 9-month toxicity study 
on cynomolgus monkey. However, according to the toxicological and juvenile study in particular, 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 27/216 
 
 
 
skeletal variations where pointed out in rats. For the juvenile toxicity study these adverse events were 
evident at all dose levels, and a NOAEL could, thus, not be established. See further information in the 
toxicology section below.  
Abrocitinib inhibits EGF at a concentration of 1 µM by 12.3% and at 10 µM, 33.2%. The inhibition of 
EGFR by abrocitinib is not large and in addition, the degree of inhibition is not increasing proportionally 
with increased concentration. The microscopic findings caused by abrocitinib inhibition was associated 
with a decrease in primary spongiosa without affecting the growth plate, which is unlike the effects by 
EGF inhibition. There were also differences in the nature of skin lesions in the abrocitinib-treated 
cynomolgus monkeys (alopecia and thinning hair coat) compared to those observed after EGFR 
inhibition (dry and flaky skin with haematoma, petechiae, and histologically disorganised hair follicles). 
The provided data does not point out a similar mechanistic effect by abrocitinib as those reported after 
EGFR or VEGFR inhibition. Thus, it is unlikely that the skeletal and skin findings observed in the 
juvenile and toxicity studies is caused by VEGFR or EGFR inhibition.  
The inhibitory potency of abrocitinib was assessed on MAOA and MAOB. MAOB retained the activity by 
98.8% at the highest concentration of abrocitinib, 100 µM. The retained MAOA activity was 67-55% in 
the 1-4 µM range, corresponding to the clinical exposure around Cmax, which for unbound is 1.25 µM 
and for total plasma concentration 3.47 µM, at the clinical dosage of 200 mg. From the subjects that 
had an ongoing psychiatric condition that required treatment, none were treated with MAO-A inhibitor 
antidepressants, indicating that the importance of MAOA inhibition by abrocitinib in the clinical trial has 
not been investigated together with MAOA inhibitors and an additional effect by aAbrocitinib has thus 
not been explored. According to the applicant, taking into account the low distribution of abrocitinib to 
brain (approximately 10%), the margin of 6.1x the unbound human Cmax at the maximum clinical dose 
of 200 mg and the fact that the MAOA inhibition is reversible, the likelihood for serotonergic syndrome 
is unlikely to occur and it is thus not necessary to addressed the MAOA inhibitory effect in the SmPC. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology of abrocitinib was assessed by in vitro assays (hERG and Nav 1.5 inhibition) 
and in vivo in rats and cynomolgus monkeys.  
The inhibition of Nav 1.5 was 6.0, 13.8, and 30.7% for the respective concentration of 30, 100 and 
300 µM. The IC50 for Nav 1.5 current inhibition by abrocitinib was >300 µM, and for the positive 
control (propafenone), 0.58 µM. In the pivotal hERG study, the inhibition was 11.0, 21.9, 50.9, and 
77.9%, for the respective concentration of 10, 30 100 and 300 μM. The IC50 for abrocitinib was 94.7 
μM. The positive control (Terfenadine) showed an 88.8% inhibition at 60 nM.  
In the functional observation battery (FOB) in rat, approximately one-hour post dosing, no apparent 
dose dependent deviations were observed. A decrease in forelimb grip strength was observed at 200 
mg/kg but was not considered abrocitinib related or biologically relevant due to the lack of dose 
response. A decrease in body temperature of 0.6°C was observed at ≥ 200 mg/kg (and a decrease of 
0.2°C at 100 mg/kg in the non-GLP study). Decreased locomotor activity was observed for all doses in 
the pivotal study. No effects were observed on the pulmonary parameters during the four-hour post-
dosing period. The applicant states that LOEL of 75 mg/kg gave an unbound Cmax of abrocitinib of 
12.6 µM (approximately 33 µM total drug). This reveals a x10 exposure margin to the human unbound 
drug plasma concentration at the recommended human dose of 200 mg revealing a Cmax of 1.25 µM 
of unbound drug. According to the study rationale, the exposure levels of 600 mg/kg were unknown in 
rat, and the exposure at 600 mg/kg was thus measured for this dose level only. Mean Cmax at 600 
mg/kg in rat was 42 µM (unbound) and 111 µM (total) at 4.3 hours after administration (Tmax) and 
AUC24 was 810 µM (unbound) and 2130 µM (total)*h/L (i.e. 34x human unbound at Cmax). The Cmax 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 28/216 
 
 
 
and AUC24 was approximately 2.5 to 3.5-fold higher at 600 mg/kg compared to an exploratory 7-day 
oral gavage toxicity study at 300 mg/kg in rat giving a Cmax of 45 µM and 17 µM for total drug and 
unbound, respectively. Corresponding values for AUC24 was 628 and 239 µM, respectively. 
Oral gavage administration of abrocitinib to Cynomolgus monkey at ≥15 mg/kg (at 0.5-3.5 hours after 
administration) was associated with increased heart rate, decreased RR-interval and secondary 
decreases in PR- and QT-interval. Upon correction for the heart rate of the QT-interval (QTc), a small 
increase in QT interval over several time periods was observed for ≥40 mg/kg, however, according to 
test site, not dose dependent or of high magnitude and is thus not considered test item-related by the 
applicant. The clinical thorough QT study indicated a concentration dependent effect judged to have a 
lack of a clinically relevant effect on QTc interval. However, in clinical phase 3 studies increases in 
QTcF was observed in all subjects with measured ECG receiving abrocitinib (200 mg, QD. For the 
highest dose, 150 mg/kg, a test item-related increase in diastolic blood pressure was observed (range 
4-8 mmHg in 4/8 animals), at 0.5-3.5 hours after administration. Emesis was found in 0 and 40 mg/kg 
for one animal in each group and a contributing effect from the vehicle may be anticipated. Test item 
related emesis started from 80 mg/kg in 3/8 animals, and for 150 mg/kg, in 6/8 animals. Plasma 
concentration was measured at 4 hours post dosing (HPD) and increased with increased dose level, 
however, not proportionally. The ±SD was large for all dose levels of unknown reason and individual 
plasma concentrations does not propose an effect due to emesis.   
The Cmax (unbound) for LOEL at 15 mg/kg, was 1.18 µM (0.9 x human unbound exposure at Cmax) 
and Cmax of the total exposure was 3.18 µM at 2.2 hours (Tmax) and AUC(0-24) was 15.40 µM.  
Overall, the pulmonary parameters were assessed in rat without any observed adverse effects during a 
four hours post dosing period. In the FOB studies in rat, a decrease in body temperature (at ≥200 
mg/kg) and locomotor activity (≥LOEL, 75 mg/kg) was observed, revealing a margin of approximately 
x10 to the human dosage of 200 mg/day to LOEL. The in vitro studies of hERG and Nav 1.5 inhibition 
by abrocitinib does not suggest any potential effects in clinically relevant concentrations. The safety 
pharmacology studies does thus not indicate any particular concern from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies with abrocitinib have been conducted. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Studies have been performed to characterise the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 
(ADME) of abrocitinib, using the intended clinical route of administration (oral), and the species 
selected for non-clinical safety testing, i.e. rats and monkeys as the main non-clinical species but also 
mice and rabbits. 
Methods of analysis 
Abrocitinib was quantified by HPLC-MS/MS in plasma from mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey. Abrocitinib 
and metabolites in plasma, urine, bile, faeces, hepatocyte and liver microsomal incubations from 
mouse, rat and monkey ADME studies were identified and determined semi-quantitatively by HPLC-UV-
MS. The analyses of M4 and M2 in rat plasma were performed by using the methods for human plasma 
which were validated in accordance with the guideline for bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 (2012) and bridged to the rat by QC-samples prepared in rat plasma. 
The analysis of M2 and M4 in rat plasma were confirmed to be performed with acceptable accuracy and 
precision and the methods used were adequately validated for rat plasma afterwards.

Absorption 
Single dose pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib in plasma were determined in male rats and monkeys, the 
main toxicological species. Abrocitinib was rapidly absorbed following oral dose administration with a 
mean tmax of 0.50 h in both species. This was in line with the mean tmax of 0.77 in humans after a dose 
of 200 mg. Mean absolute oral bioavailability was high in rats (96%), low in monkeys (9.8%) and 
moderate in humans (60%).  
Following intravenous administration, volume of distribution at steady state and plasma clearance in 
rats and monkeys were estimated to 1.04 L/kg and 0.814 L/kg, respectively, and to 26.6 ml/min/kg 
and 31.8 ml/min/kg, respectively, indicating wide distribution (beyond plasma and extracellular fluid), 
extensive metabolism and a short terminal half-life in both species. The terminal half-life was 
estimated to 0.82 h in rats and 0.52 h in monkeys. In humans, the terminal half-life was 2 to 5 h. 
Multiple dose pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib in plasma are determined in the toxicokinetic parts of the 
oral repeat-dose toxicity studies in male and female mice, rats, monkeys and female rabbits. No 
consistent gender differences in plasma exposure to abrocitinib (Cmax and AUC24h) were observed in 
mice, rats and monkeys.  
In all species mean Cmax and AUC24h of abrocitinib at steady state increased with increasing dose over 
the dose range studied. In rats, the increase in AUC24h was somewhat higher than dose proportional (> 
50%) from 3 to 30 mg/kg and then approximately dose proportional up to 200 mg/kg. No consistent 
accumulation was observed on days 29 and 182 in the repeated dose toxicity studies. In monkeys 
there was in general a higher than dose proportional increase (> 50%) in AUC24h between the dose 
levels studied and no consistent accumulation, except at the 75 mg/kg dose in the 9 month study 
where an approximately 2-fold accumulation was observed from day 92 to day 273. In mice the 
increase in AUC24h at steady state was approximately dose proportional up to 20/25 mg/kg and then 
higher (> 50% higher than dose proportional increase) at the 60/75 mg/kg dose level. 
Distribution 
Tissue distribution in pigmented (Long Evans) rats following oral administration of [14C]-labelled 
abrocitinib was evaluated by quantitative whole-body autoradiography. The results showed that [14C]-
abrocitinib-derived radioactivity was widely and rapidly distributed with the highest levels occurring at 
0.25 h post dose in most tissue and up to 4 h post dose for the eye. Highest concentrations of 
radioactivity, excluding the gastro-intestinal tract, were observed in the uveal tract, liver, kidney, 
adrenal glands and salivary glands.  
Low levels of [14C]-abrocitinib-derived radioactivity were detected in non-circumventricular CNS tissues 
at for at least 4 hours. The brain:plasma AUClast ratio was <0.1, indicating that the passage over 
blood-brain barrier was low. For most tissues the radioactivity was eliminated at 168 hours post-dose. 
In the thyroid, gland radioactivity was present up to 336 hours and the arterial walls, intervertebral 
ligament(s), uveal tract and whole eye(s) contained radioactivity at the last sampling 672 hours post-
dose indicating affinity of [14C]-abrocitinib-derived radioactivity to ocular and itegumentary melanin.  
Plasma protein binding of abrocitinib was similar in rats, monkeys and humans (fu was 0.38, 0.37, and 
0.36, respectively) and lower and higher in mice (fu: 0.55) and rabbits (fu: 0.19), respectively 
compared to humans. For rabbits, which has a lower unbound fraction than humans, an exposure 
margins calculated based on total plasma concentrations will be overestimated in terms of unbound 
concentrations. The use of unbound plasma PK parameters for calculation of exposure margins is thus 
considered relevant for the rabbit toxicity studies. 
In humans the plasma protein binding of the major metabolites M2 (fu: 0.71) and M4 (fu: 0.83) were 
lower than for abrocitinib and lower than for the protein binding of M2 and M4 in rats (fu was 0.55 and 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 30/216 
 
 
 
0.76, respectively). As the unbound fractions of M2 and M4 are higher in rats compared to humans, 
exposure margins calculated based on total plasma concentrations of these metabolites will not be 
overestimated in terms of unbound concentrations. According to the applicant, protein binding 
determined at a single concentration which is low relative the total plasma concentrations in the pivotal 
rabbit EFD study will result in conservative margins for the unbound plasma exposure and therefore 
sufficient. This is agreed by CHMP. 
Abrocitinib showed no preferential partitioning into red blood cells in any of the species tested with, 
B/P ratios of 1.00, 0.92, 0.59, 1.01 and 1.07 in mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey and human, respectively. 
In lactating rats the milk AUCinf:plasma AUCinf ratio was 5.24 suggesting exposure of pups to 
abrocitinib via milk from dams treated with oral doses from 10 mg/kg.  
Metabolism 
The metabolism of abrocitinib was investigated in vitro in liver microsomes and hepatocytes of mouse, 
rat, monkey and human and in vivo in mouse, rat, monkey and human. 
In vitro 
Unchanged drug and various metabolites mainly representing separate hydroxylation’s of the aliphatic 
propyl group or the N-methyl-pyrrolo-pyrimidine (e.g. M1, M2, M3 and M4), oxidative demethylation 
(M5) and several minor metabolites involving secondary oxidations and hydrations as well as cysteine 
and glutathione conjugation were detected in liver microsomes and hepatocytes across species. All 
human metabolites detected except the glucuronide were observed in the animal liver preparations.  
Based on in vitro CYP phenotyping, CYP2C19 (~ 50%) was indicated to be the primary clearance route 
for abrocitinib, followed by contributions from CYP2C9 (~ 30%), CYP3A4 (~ 10%) and CYP2B6 (~ 
10%).  
In vivo 
Abrocitinib was extensively metabolised. Unchanged drug and various metabolites mainly representing 
separate hydroxylation’s of the aliphatic propyl group or the N-methyl-pyrrolo-pyrimidine (e.g. M1, M2, 
M3 and M4), carboxylic acid (M7), hydroxylation/carboxylation (M6), tri-hydroxylation, 
hydroxylation/hydrolysis, oxidative demethylation (M5) and several minor metabolites involving 
secondary oxidations and hydrations, were detected in plasma, urine and faeces of humans and in 
plasma and/or urine of mice, rats and monkeys. All human metabolites detected were observed in 
plasma or urine of the animal species.  
Two of the human metabolites, M2 and M4, were identified as major metabolites in accordance with 
ICH M3 (R2). Metabolites M2 and M4 were shown to be present in plasma of mice (M2 and M4), rats 
(M2 and M4) and monkeys (M4 only). For qualification of M2 and M4 a separate pharmacokinetic study 
was performed in rats. Steady state pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib, M2 and M4 were estimated 
following 5 days of daily repeated oral administration of NOAEL dosages from the 6-month chronic 
toxicity study (45 mg/kg for females and 70 g/kg for males) and compared to those in humans 
following daily oral dosing of 200 mg abrocitinib. The rat/human ratios for AUC24h were above 0.5 
indicating that the exposures for M2 and M4 in rats represent at least 50% of the exposure in humans. 
The applicant therefore considered these major metabolites to be toxicologically qualified in accordance 
with ICH M3 (R2). As there are no values available for the half-lives of metabolites M2 and M4 in rats it 
is not clear if steady state for these metabolites is reached following 5 days administration. In case 
steady state levels have not been reached the obtained rat/human exposure ratios for M2 and M4 are 
underestimated and thus still sufficient. It could be noted that [14C]-abrocitinib-derived radioactivity 
was eliminated from plasma with a t1/2 value of 8.95 h in Long Evans rats, which is markedly longer 
than the t1/2 of 0.82 h obtained for abrocitinib in Spraque Dawley rats. This indicates that there are 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 31/216 
 
 
 
metabolites with longer half-lives than abrocitinib and that 5 days should be sufficient to reach steady 
state.  
As the strategy with qualification of major metabolites in a separate PK study is uncommon the 
applicant was requested to bridge the AUC24h for abrocitinib in relevant toxicity studies to the 
corresponding results in the separate PK study in order to verify that the exposure to M2 and M4, 
especially M2 which is on the borderline, can be regarded as sufficient. Rat versus human ratios for M2 
and M4 in various rat toxicity studies were extrapolated from the exposure ratios obtained in a PK 
bridging study and corresponding dose ratios assuming dose linear kinetics. As estimated exposure 
ratios above 0.5 were obtained for pivotal rat toxicity studies including the 6-month repeated toxicity 
study, the EFD study, the in vivo micronucleus study, and for all ratios except for M2 in females (0.28) 
in the carcinogenicity study, the major human metabolites M2 and M4 are considered toxicologically 
qualified.  
Whereas the metabolism of abrocitinib was thoroughly investigated in vitro in liver microsomes and 
hepatocytes of mouse, rat, monkey and human and in vivo in mouse, rat, monkey and human, there 
were no metabolism data generated by the applicant in rabbit. The skeletal effects observed in the 
rabbit EFD study are described in SmPC section 5.3. Further, abrocitinib is contraindicated during 
pregnancy. Thus, the lack of information on the metabolism and exposure to metabolites in the rabbit 
is acceptable.  
Excretion 
In rats 7% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug in urine and 0.1 % of the dose was excreted 
as unchanged drug in bile. This is in line with humans for which less than 1% was eliminated as 
unchanged drug in urine. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant developed abrocitinib, an orally active small molecule that reversibly and selectively 
inhibits JAK1 by blocking the ATP binding site. The initially proposed use was in adult and adolescent 
patients from 12 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD as monotherapy or in combination with 
medicated topical therapy. The intended dosing is up to 200mg QD. Abrocitinib has been evaluated in a 
comprehensive set of non-clinical toxicity studies with the active substance administered by the oral 
route in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. According to the applicant, rats and monkeys were used for 
the general toxicology programme, as these species have previously been used in development 
programmes for other similar JAK inhibitors and they are sensitive to the pharmacological action of JAK 
inhibition. Further, all relevant human metabolites of abrocitinib have been identified in at least one of 
the species. Upon request from the CHMP, the activity of abrocitinib on the JAK family members in the 
selected safety pharmacology/toxicity species were made available. 
The toxicology programme is comprised of general toxicology studies and studies of genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity including juvenile toxicity, phototoxicity and immunotoxicity. In 
addition, studies on metabolites and impurities have been performed to complete the programme. The 
oral route was chosen for the programme since it is the clinical route of administration. A suspension of 
abrocitinib was administered in the rat, mouse and rabbit studies. An SSD formulation was developed 
for the studies in cynomolgus monkey as it was identified by the applicant as the most appropriate 
formulation for the cynomolgus monkey studies based on tolerability and toxicokinetics. Despite these 
measures and the fact that the monkeys were dosed in the fed state to minimise emesis, reflux and 
emesis were quite frequent in the general toxicity studies in monkey. 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 32/216 
 
 
 
The toxicity profile of abrocitinib was mostly reflective of the JAK inhibitory pharmacological action of 
the substance, with effects mainly on the immune and haematolymphopoietic systems. Adverse 
toxicities have been identified in the programme which are presented and discussed below. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Two non-GLP single-dose toxicity studies have been submitted where one was performed in Sprague-
Dawley (SD) rat and one in cynomolgus monkey. In the rat, oral gavage of 500mg/kg was identified as 
the highest non-lethal dose in the study. In the monkey study, where the objective was to identify an 
optimal oral formulation of abrocitinib for the future repeated dose toxicity studies, an SDD formulation 
was well tolerated at doses up to 150mg/kg/day when given as a single dose. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated-dose toxicity studies of abrocitinib have been performed in rats and cynomolgus monkey. In 
the rat studies, the SD strain was used for the non-GLP 7-day study, but 1-month and 6-month studies 
were undertaken in Wistar Han rats. The age of the rats in the studies varied. In the 7-day study, the 
ages were 6-8 weeks old when dosing was initiated, whereas the animals used in the 1-month study 
were 9 weeks and in the 6-month study dosing was initiated when the rats were 6-7 weeks old. The 
cynomolgus monkeys used were 2-4 years old. 
Mortality 
Mortalities were evident in the non-clinical study programme.  
In the 6-month study in rat, three animals died or were euthanised in the study. Two high-dose deaths 
were related to the TK blood collection. The third animal was euthanised in a moribund condition on 
Day 101 of the dosing phase. Based on the data presented, the deaths were not likely related to the 
test substance. 
In the 9-month cynomolgus monkey study, one female given 75 mg/kg/day was euthanised on SD 271 
as she had self-mutilated her right foot. The animal had also injection-site lesions. Neuropathic pain or 
numbness secondary to sciatic nerve injection with ketamine was provided as explanations for the self-
mutilation. While the explanation is plausible, the underlying reason is considered unknown. 
In the 6-month carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice, 7/15 deaths in the abrocitinib dose-groups 
were considered related to obstructive nephropathy. Only 1 death was recorded in the control group. 
In the 2-year carcinogenicity study in rat, survival rate was overall low, especially in female controls 
with a survival rate of only 42% at study termination, suggesting that the study may have been 
terminated earlier. 
Bodyweight and food consumption 
Effects on bodyweight and food consumption were generally non-adverse. Overall, the effects noted 
were reductions in food consumption with transient effects on food consumption. However, in the 1-
month study in rat, males receiving 200mg/kg/day had a 38% increase in bodyweight change over the 
study-period. The underlying reason for this is unclear. No correlating change in food consumption was 
evident. 
Clinical signs 
Reflux and emesis were reoccurring problems in the study programme in monkey. In the 14-day study, 
efflux and emesis were substantial problems in most animals during the dosing, but only in the 
100mg/kg/day group post dosing. In the 1-month study, reflux was frequent during dosing, and it 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 33/216 
 
 
 
occurred in 13/24 animals on the study. In the 9-month study, vomitus was frequently seen without 
clear treatment-relation during the study period. No vomitus was recorded in the recovery animals, 
which may suggest that the dosing phase was associated with nausea in the animals. In the 1-month 
study, these effects were most prominent around dosing. No such information is available in the 9-
month study data. 
Scabs and skin sores were prominent findings in the rat 6-month study with females more affected, 
and one female had scabs throughout the recovery period. These skin findings correlated with 
erosion/ulcer (mild-moderate) including dermal inflammation in three females receiving ≥45 
mg/kg/day. According to the applicant, these findings are not adverse. While clearly treatment related, 
the findings were graded mild-moderate with a focal presentation and with no reported lack of impact 
on overall animal health. However, in the two females administered 70 mg/kg/day, granuloma 
formation was evident. It is generally held that this inflammatory response is particularly common 
whenever the immune system is unable to readily eliminate a pathogen. Thus, the inflammation is 
likely a representation of the immunosuppression. Given that the marked immunosuppression at 70 
mg/kg/day also resulted in a prostate inflammation in two HD males (see below) it is clear that the 
dose-level is overly immunosuppressing to the point that opportunistic pathogen infections are 
allowed.  
In the 9-month monkey study, females displayed alopecia and thinning hair coat (various locations) at 
75mg/kg/day, but this was not considered adverse. 
Effects on the lymphopoietic system and immune parameters 
Abrocitinib-related changes in circulating total lymphocytes including specific lymphocyte subsets were 
consistently seen in the pivotal studies and is considered reflective of the JAK inhibitory effect of the 
substance. The reductions in lymphocyte counts generally correlated with lower mean lymphoid organ 
weights and decreased lymphoid cellularity in lymphoid organs.  
In the rat 6-month study, decreases in lymphoid cellularity (graded up to severe) were evident in 
thymus, spleen, GALT and lymph nodes. For the spleen and thymus, they corresponded with reduced 
organ weights and for the spleen with macroscopic findings of small spleens at doses above 30 
mg/kg/day. As these findings were not associated with clear organ damage (inflammation, fibrosis) the 
applicant did not consider them adverse. While no clear organ pathology was evident, it was clear from 
skin and prostate inflammations in the same study that the animals were severely immunosuppressed 
at the highest dose-level. Further, a male administered 45 mg/kg/day also presented with prostate 
inflammation, but without the epithelial atypia and inclusion material, thus the inflammation in this 
animal was considered unrelated to treatment and spontaneous. While it is considered unlikely that an 
unrelated spontaneous prostate inflammation would incidentally show up in an animal with clearly 
suppressed immune system, it is agreed that the causative agent was not likely the icosahedral virions 
found in the HD males. The inflammation could be treatment related, but as it only occurred in one 
animal, and moderate inflammation can be a spontaneous finding in the rat it was not further pursued 
by CHMP. 
In the monkey studies, the effects on lymphocytes also correlated with reduced thymus weights and 
reduced lymphoid cellularity in thymus and spleen. In the 1-month study, these immunosuppressive 
effects resulted in cytomegalovirus infection in all males administered 150 mg/kg/day. As this infection 
is normally latent in immunocompetent macaques and is controlled by the cell-mediated immune 
response, this finding is suggestive of excessive immunosuppression and is considered adverse in 
males at 150 mg/kg/day. No findings of cytomegalovirus were noted in females. While exposure was 
slightly higher in males in the 150 mg/kg/day dose group which may signal a more severe 
immunosuppression, this does not explain the difference between the sexes at the individual level as 
the toxicokinetic data was very variable. According to the applicant, the reason for the occurrence of 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 34/216 
 
 
 
CMV in only males in the study is less clear, as sex is not a known factor involved in CMV reactivation 
in monkey. However, immunocompetence in general is established as a sexually dimorphic trait in 
humans, thus a similar pattern in monkey is possible or even likely. As it is assumed that any obvious 
differences in environmental factors would have been identified by the applicant, the proposition of the 
finding as coincidental is also a possibility given that the group size in monkey studies is limited. 
Decreased cellularity of the bone marrow was only noted in the 1-month study in monkey. It involved 
all cell lines (erythroid and myeloid precursors and megakaryocytes) and was observed from 40 
mg/kg/day in males from 80 mg/kg/day in females. This finding correlated with decreases in RBCs, 
HGB, and HCT from 80 mg/kg/day and decreased reticulocytes from 40 mg/kg/day. However, given 
the relatively mild reductions in erythrocytes and platelets (minimal-mild) the finding was not 
considered adverse. 
Immunophenotyping was performed in the monkey studies. In the 1-month study, there were test 
article-related decreases in T cells (T helper and T cytotoxic) and plasma cells at 150 mg/kg/day in 
both sexes and decreases in B cells only in males. Natural killer cells were consistently reduced at all 
dose levels in males and females. In the 9-month study, no test article-related changes were observed 
in the number of B, T, T helper, T cytotoxic, and T memory cell subsets. However, NK cells were 
decreased. Clear effects were noted on IgA (HD), IgG and IgM in serum (SD177 and SD274). Upon 
request from CHMP, the applicant provided mean values for IgA, IgG and IgM. Based on the mean data 
provided, the overarching conclusion remains from the initial assessment that abrocitinib-related 
effects are noted on IgM and IgA, whereas no meaningful effects are noted on IgG levels as a 
consequence of abrocitinib exposure. 
A KLH study was performed in monkeys from the 9-month study. Abrocitinib exposure gave reduced 
IgG and IgM values (with dose relation) from 15mg/kg/day with partial recovery. While no signs of 
infection were noted in the study, the only partial recovery of the immune system after 2 months 
recovery is of concern. 
Collectively, the effects on the lymphopoietic system and immune parameters reflect pharmacological 
effects of the JAK1-inhibition. While monitorable in the clinic, they ultimately lead to an increased 
susceptibility to infection and is a clear risk-factor for tumour development. No complete recovery of 
these effect was noted in the 9-month study in monkey, and thus should receive further attention in 
the clinical setting. See further discussion in clinical safety and risk management plan sections.  
Bone 
Effects on bone were noted in the 7-day and 1-month rat studies at an age comparable to adolescent 
human age of ≥ 12 years. Exposure margins at which no bone finding was noted were 5.7 to 6.1 times 
the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg. In the 7-day study, 
reduced mineralised cartilage was noted in the physis of femur and tibia at the interface of the growth 
plate and the primary spongiosum (minimal-mild). In the longer 1 month-study, the same effects were 
noted graded minimal-mild at 75mg/kg/day and with up to the moderate grade at 200mg/kg/day. 
Importantly, no effects were identified in the 6-month study at doses up to 70 mg/kg/day (up to 25 
times the human AUC at the MRHD of 200 mg). According to the applicant, this indicates high 
sensitivity to the bone dystrophy effect in rapidly growing rats. While this explanation is plausible, the 
rats in the 1-month study were 9 weeks at initiation of dosing, whereas the rats in the 6-month study 
were 6-7 weeks. Thus, the age parameter is not fitting to the explanation. The applicant was asked to 
elaborate on possible mechanisms why the bone-effect was apparent after 7 days or 1-month 
administration of 75 mg/kg/day and higher doses but not after 6 months administration of a similar 
dose of 70 mg/kg/day. Following the applicant’s elaboration severe and partly irreversible bone 
findings in rats were only observed when the administration period covered the most vulnerable time 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 35/216 
 
 
 
window of PND10 to 20. When administration started later in the life of rats, i.e. PND42-PND63, only 
microscopic bone findings (bone dystrophy at the interface of the growth plate and the primary 
spongiosum) were observed. No findings were reported when administration started at PND42-49 
which was explained, according to the applicant, by resolution of a potential delay in ossification that 
occurred in the early phase of the study during maturation of the animals even during continuing 
administration of abrocitinib. The applicant added data generated with tofacitinib, a JAK1/3 inhibitor for 
which they hold a marketing authorisation, in order to broaden the view on potential bone effects 
provoked by JAK-inhibitors. No bone-findings were reported for tofacitinib when administered 
postnatally to rats and monkeys. Of note, tofacitinib was administered to rats only after PND 21 and, 
thus, when femoral bone neck formation was complete. From the information provided by the applicant 
it appears that microscopic evaluation, as done for abrocitinib, was not performed in juvenile rat 
studies with tofacitinib. Thus, based on the available information the lack of findings for tofacitinib 
might not be entirely translatable to abrocitinib due to differences in study design.  
The applicant further outlined that the bone development in rats significantly differs from that in 
humans in that the femoral bone neck is fully developed before the start of ambulation which is not the 
case in rats. As a consequence, the translatability of rat findings to humans might be difficult. 
Therefore, probably more attention should be drawn to the second non-clinical species, the 
cynomolgus monkey. NHP studies conducted in support of the safety of abrocitinib covered the age 
range of 2 to 7 years corresponding to humans from 8 to 21 years. Thus, with regard to bone effects, 
children <8 years are not considered sufficiently covered by non-clinical studies. While it was clarified 
that microscopic evaluations that might have been able to capture analogies to rat findings (bone 
dystrophy at the interface of the growth plate and the primary spongiosum) have also been performed 
in monkeys, from a non-clinical point of view, the mechanism underlying inhibition of bone 
development is not clear, which poses a significant uncertainty to the use of abrocitinib in paediatric 
patients (including adolescents). Nevertheless, additional non-clinical studies would not significantly 
add to the elucidation of this uncertainty. See further discussion in clinical safety section. 
Bone/skeletal effects in the DART programme 
Skeletal observations including increased fetal incidences of short 13th ribs and increased fetal and/or 
litter incidences of thickened ribs, cervical arches with reduced ventral processes and unossified 
metatarsals were observed in the pivotal rat EFD study. In the pivotal EFD study in rabbits there were 
increased litter and fetal incidences of unossified forelimb phalanges as well as small increases in the 
litter and fetal incidences of unossified hind limb tarsals and phalanges and of unossified xiphoid. 
No apparent effects on bone or skeleton were clinically evident in the PPND study. No skeletal 
examination was performed of any generation in the study, however, more discrete changes not 
evident from gross morphology are possible. This lack of apparent bone effects in the PPND study may 
support that while there is considerable transfer of abrocitinib to breast milk, lactational exposure to 
abrocitinib is insufficient to produce the bone effects evident in 6-9-week old rats or the effects noted 
in the juvenile toxicity study.  
In the pivotal juvenile toxicity study, observations of malrotated and/or impaired forelimbs and 
hindlimbs were identified from PND 16 at all doses starting at PND10. No effects (clinical signs or 
otherwise) were reported from the DRF-study despite that the same dose-levels were used, and the 
pups were exposed to PND24. The reason for this is unclear. The findings in the pivotal study 
corresponded macroscopically to bent tibia and fracture, misshapen (or missing) femoral head and 
neck. Microscopic correlates included abnormal morphology of the femoral head in bones at all doses. 
No NOAEL could be identified in the study. Further, decreased mineralised cartilage in femur and 
physis dystrophy in stifle joint (decreased primary spongiosa) was present in all abrocitinib exposure

groups. This finding was also seen in the 7-day and 1-month (but not the 6-month) repeated dose 
toxicity studies as discussed above, but there they did not lead to apparent clinical signs. The similarity 
of these findings indicates that developmental exposure to abrocitinib (spanning from PND10 to week 9 
at dose initiation) in the rat can induce dysmorphic effects in the bone.  
A juvenile toxicity study in rats were used in the development of tofacitinib, a JAK1/3 inhibitor. No 
impact on bone development was evident in these studies, according to the applicant, this was 
because the studies were initiated at PND21, compared to PND 10 in the juvenile toxicity study in the 
present application. While this may partly explain the lack of effects in the tofacitinib studies, the 
decreased primary spongiosa noted at 6-9-week-old rats suggest that the abrocitinib induced effects 
on bone are occurring up to and including adolescence.  
Overall, abrocitinib induced effects on bone development when administration occurs postnatally in the 
rat. Effects range from clearly adverse findings at early postnatal exposure where essentially no 
femoral head or neck is present to decreased mineralised cartilage in femur and physis dystrophy 
when exposure occurs around weeks 6-9. No effects on bone were noted in the 6-month study in rat, 
despite that these animals were 6-7 weeks old and had similar abrocitinib exposure. While the lack of 
effects on bone development in 2-4-year-old cynomolgus monkeys might be reassuring, the 
pharmacological relevance of the species for the human situation is currently unclear. No cross-
reactivity studies have been shown, however, it is possible that the abrocitinib induced effects on bone 
development in rat (and likely human) are not inducible in the monkey.  
Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant provided a comprehensive reflection and discussion 
regarding the abrocitinib-induced effects on bone development noted in the general toxicology studies 
in rat and in the DART programme. In the studies, abrocitinib-induced effects on bone development 
were evident during in utero and early postnatal life, and the effects were varied depending on when 
and to what extent the developing organism was exposed. In the EFD-studies in SD rat and NZW 
rabbit, the exposure resulted mainly in skeletal variations and developmental ossification delay. 
However, as no TK-data was made available, the extent of fetal exposure remains unclear. In the 
PPND study in rat, no obvious skeletal effects were noted in the F1-generation even if limited 
evaluation (i.e. macroscopic evaluation) was performed thus only gross malformations would likely be 
identified. In the juvenile toxicity study where abrocitinib was administered daily from PND10 to 
PND63, major skeletal malformations were evident with paw malrotation, bent bone (tibia), fractures 
and secondary joint inflammation. From 5 mg/kg/day, small or misshapen femoral heads were 
observed where there was essentially no femoral head or neck present at the highest severity level. 
Further, decreased mineralised cartilage in femur and physis dystrophy in stifle joint (decreased 
primary spongiosa) was present in all abrocitinib exposure groups. No NOAEL was set in the study, and 
the findings were considered adverse and not compatible with further juvenile development of the 
drug.  
Interestingly, in the shorter general toxicity studies in 6-9-week-old rats, abrocitinib-induced 
microscopic bone metaphysis dystrophy (defined as decreased primary spongiosa) was also noted, but 
this finding was not seen in the 6-month study where 6-7-week-old rats were used. 
According to the applicant, the underlying reasons for the differences in effects noted in the studies are 
related to a combination of developmental processes occurring at the time of exposure, bone 
structures at pre- and post-natal development, and changes in biomechanical loading associated with 
the onset of ambulatory activity.  
In-house studies performed by the applicant have shown that at approximately PND 14 (the age at 
which rat pups become ambulatory), the proximal femoral growth plates are splitting into one plate for 
the formation of the femoral neck, and one for the formation of the greater trochanter. The hypothesis 
is that abrocitinib exposure leads to a delayed ossification of the femoral neck and other impacted long 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 37/216 
 
 
 
bones such that the biomechanical loading associated with the starting ambulation leads to 
deformation of the cartilaginous femur head and neck which leads to fractures and other adversities of 
the bone. Accordingly, a major part of the effect is that ambulation is started before the bones have 
fully developed.  
The applicant also considered that exposure to a JAK-1 inhibitor later in bone development, when the 
bones are more developed, does not induce bone morphogenic effects as a consequence of 
ambulation.  
In the juvenile DRF-study with abrocitinib, rats were exposed to abrocitinib at doses up to 75 
mg/kg/day from PND10 to PND24. In this study, no obvious bone effects were reported, whereas in 
the definitive study (exposure PND10-PND63), clinical observations of malrotated and impaired 
forelimbs and hindlimbs were noted at exposures at and above 25 mg/kg/day already from PND16, 
which led to termination of 5 severely affected juveniles. The clinical findings corresponded to various 
macroscopic and microscopic changes in the bone. Delays in ossification of long bones are not 
uncommon findings in DART and juvenile toxicity studies, but the severity of the effects (or 
consequences of the delay) are not as dramatic, despite change in mechanical loading postnatally as a 
consequence of ambulation.  While the general explanation put forth by the applicant to explain the 
adverse bone effects in the juvenile toxicity study seems plausible there are remaining major 
uncertainties. Further, a potential mechanism behind the abrocitinib-induced delayed ossification and 
its dramatic effects on critical bones is currently lacking.   
The bone metaphysis dystrophy noted in the shorter general toxicity studies (in Wistar and SD rats) 
and in the juvenile toxicity study were not seen in the pivotal 6-month study in the Wistar strain. 
According to the applicant, a possible explanation is that any delay in the ossification processes that 
occurred at younger ages resolved as the animals matured. While this is considered likely and is 
further supported by the recovery of this particular finding in the juvenile study animals after a 2-
month recovery, it is unclear if these effects induced before attainment of peak bone mass may have 
effects on bone mineralisation and/or bone quality endpoints. 
No bone effects were evident in the general toxicity study in monkey despite exposure to abrocitinib 
from an age comparable to approximately 8-10 years old in humans, up to 30 times the human AUC at 
the MRHD of 200 mg, in the 9-month toxicity study. While the underlying reason for the lack of effect 
in monkey is unknown, the applicant suggested that relative differences in bone development in 
relation to age is a possible reason. According to the applicant, in monkeys and humans major bone 
structures, including femoral neck, are fully developed prenatally and onset of ambulatory activity and 
associated biomechanical loading occur relatively later postnatally. Accordingly, in monkey (and 
human) a developmental delay in ossification of major bone structures (prenatally) would not be 
challenged by ambulation which could lead to bone deformation. While it is agreed that major bone 
structures in monkey and human are developed prenatally, postnatal development occurs and 
mechanical strain is required for postnatal, but not for prenatal skeletal development and maintenance. 
While no data support that abrocitinib induced bone effects in the 1- and 9-month studies in 
cynomolgus monkey, it is established that JAK signalling plays an important role in bone development 
and metabolism. However, the direct effects of inhibitors on bone development remain unclear but the 
relative inhibition of different JAKs seems to be an important factor. Thus, there is a remaining 
uncertainty regarding the developmental bone effects, which should receive further clinical attention.  
Skin 
Abrocitinib-related skin effects were noted across the non-clinical study programme. They were most 
prominent in the rat studies and included abrasions in the mouth, shoulder and cervical region which in 
some animals led to ulcers. Further, scabs and skin sores were noted from 45 mg/kg/day in the 6-
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 38/216 
 
 
 
months study and perioral scab was found also after 2 months recovery at 70 mg/kg/day. Incidence 
alopecia and thinning hair coat was evident in the 9-month study in monkey at 75 mg/kg/day.  
Kidney 
The kidney was not identified as a target organ in the general toxicology programme. However, in the 
1-month DRF studies Tg rasH2 (wt/wt) mice preceding the 6-month carcinogenicity study, adverse 
kidney findings were evident including nephropathy with renal tissue loss. In the mice (and in rats in 
the rat 6-month study administered abrocitinib at ≥45 mg/kg/day) urinary crystals were found. 
Pharmacokinetic excretion data showed that the crystals mainly contained the M4 metabolite. The 
applicant’s position is that urinary crystals is a rodent phenomenon, related to the high rodent urine 
osmolality which favours crystal precipitation. As there were no renal findings reported in the general 
toxicology programme, and no urinary crystals identified in monkey urine, the clinical relevance of the 
renal findings in the rodents is considered limited. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
A full programme of genotoxicity studies has been performed by the applicant. The Ames test 
performed in the Salmonella strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and the E. coli strain P2 uvrA 
pKM101 was negative up to 5000 μg abrocitinib per plate. In an in vitro micronucleus test in TK6-cells, 
a positive response was observed at 37.4 and 43.6 µg/mL. Based on further mechanistic investigations 
in a FISH-assay, the conclusion was reached that abrocitinib is aneugenic at concentrations from 37.4 
µg/mL. An in vivo micronucleus assay in the rat where bone marrow smears were evaluated came out 
negative. Collectively, the genotoxicity studies presented do not indicate a genotoxic risk for abrocitinib 
at the proposed clinical dose of 200 mg QD. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice (6-month study in Tg rasH2 mice) and rats (104-week 
study). In mice, no neoplasms were identified, but there was a dose-related increase in the incidence 
of thymic cell hyperplasia in females from 25 mg/kg/day. In rats, thymus hyperplasia was higher in 
females administered 30 mg/kg/day, and a higher incidence of thymoma was noted in females from 3 
mg/kg/day. Immunosuppression is a clear risk-factor for tumour development, especially spontaneous 
tumours (like thymomas). However, thymomas were evident in females already from the lowest dose, 
with low margins of exposure to human exposure.  
Further, only one case of malignant thymoma was noted in the study (in the 10 mg/kg dose group) 
which does not suggest a treatment-related increase. However, it is unclear to what extent there can 
be progression from a benign thymoma to a malignant thymoma and the tumour biology underlying 
such a shift.  
The increase in thymoma incidence is noted in female rats and from exposures around clinical 
exposure whereas no apparent increase is not apparent in male rats up to 14x unbound human AUC. 
The reason for this sex difference is unclear, but the applicant referenced studies suggesting that 
thymuses of female Wistar Han rats exhibit a more delayed physiologic thymic involution than those of 
males or other rat strains and that a higher frequency of spontaneous thymoma formation in Wistar 
rats is related to higher numbers of thymocytes at baseline and higher proliferation rates of TECs. This 
then may lead to a higher sensitivity for thymoma formation in the female Wistar rat following 
administration of an immunosuppressive drug such as abrocitinib. Overall, this explanation regarding 
increase female sensitivity seems possible and it was agreed that abrocitinib treatment seems to 
accelerate the thymoma formation in the rat. 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 39/216 
 
 
 
The human risk for abrocitinib-induced thymoma is currently unclear. Other immunosuppressive 
treatments (including the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib) have induced thymomas in cancer studies but there 
is according to the applicant currently no clinical evidence suggesting an increased risk for human 
thymoma development. Nevertheless, given the unclear human relevance of the thymoma findings, 
the applicant included data in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In a fertility and early embryonic developmental study in male and female rats there were no 
treatment article-related findings on fertility in males (including copulation/fertility indices, sperm 
motility and sperm counts) following oral treatment with 30, 45 and 70 mg abrocitinib/kg/day. For the 
females an adverse lower female fertility index (56% vs 95% in controls) and mean number of corpora 
lutea (9.6 vs. 12.4 in the controls) were observed at the 70 mg/kg dose level. In addition, mean 
numbers per litter of viable embryos were decreased (4.2 at 70 mg/kg vs. 11.3 in controls) and mean 
percent per litter of post-implantation loss were increased (61% at 70 mg/kg/day vs. 5.3% in controls) 
in a dose-dependent manner at all dose levels of abrocitinib. Based on the lack of abrocitinib-related 
adverse effects, the NOAEL for male reproductive toxicity was set to 70 mg/kg/day. Due to adverse 
decreased numbers of corpora lutea at 70 mg/kg/day and higher post-implantation loss (embryo-lethal 
effects) from the lowest dose level of 30 mg/kg/day a NOAEL for female reproductive toxicity and early 
embryonic development could not be set. 
In the follow-up study effects on female reproduction and early embryonic development following oral 
treatment with 3, 10 and 70 mg abrocitinib/kg/day with a 1 month-period of recovery for the 70 
mg/kg dose level were investigated. In line with the other study, an adverse lower fertility index (50% 
vs 95% in controls) were observed in the 70 mg/kg/day dose group. Whereas no effects were noted 
for mean number of corpora lutea there was a decreased mean number of implantation sites (7.5 
compared to 11.8 in control), an increased percentage of pre-implantation loss (31% compared to 
4.7% in control) and a 100% post-implantation loss with 0 viable embryos at the 70 mg/kg dose level. 
No significant changes on fertility or embryonal development were observed in the 3 and 10 mg/kg 
dose group. All abrocitinib-induced effects on fertility and early embryonal development in the 70 
mg/kg dose group was shown to be reversible, none of the effects was present in the recovery animals 
mated after 1-month recovery period. Due to the adverse lower fertility and higher embryonal lethality 
at 70 mg/kg/day the NOAEL for female reproductive toxicity and early embryonic development was set 
to 10 mg/kg/day, which represents a 1.9-fold exposure margin (total AUC) to the clinical exposure at 
200 mg. 
In the pivotal rat EFD study, there were increased average numbers of late resorptions (0.6 vs. 0.0 in 
controls) and dead fetuses (3 from 3 litters vs. 0 from 0 litter) at the highest dose level of 60 mg/kg 
which resulted in an increased post-implantation loss (mean% of 9.5 vs. 7.2 in controls). Skeletal 
observations considered as abrocitinib-related included increased fetal incidences of short 13th ribs in 
the 30 and 60 mg/kg dose groups and fetal and/or litter incidences of thickened ribs, cervical arches 
with reduced ventral processes and unossified metatarsals at the 60 mg/kg dose level. These skeletal 
findings were regarded by the applicant as common findings in this rodent species and strain 
representing reversible delays or accelerations in development not expected to adversely impact 
viability or health. As the skeletal findings observed at the 30 and 60 mg/kg dose levels are not 
confirmed as common findings at the study site or to resolve postnatally they should be considered 
adverse and the developmental NOAEL in rats should be set to 10 mg/kg/day. With respect to the 
adverse skeletal findings in the rat juvenile toxicity study, e.g. paw malrotation, bent bone and small 
or misshapen femoral head proposed to result from delayed ossification in combination with 
ambulation on underdeveloped bones, the delayed ossification observed in the rat EFD study should 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 40/216 
 
 
 
however be regarded as adverse. Even if delayed ossification can be expected to resolve postnatally 
this has not been shown to occur before start of ambulation stated to occur approximately at PND 14, 
i.e. potential effects on postnatal bone development cannot be excluded. The margins of exposure at 
the NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day for embryo-fetal lethality and at the NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day for skeletal 
effects to the clinical exposure at 200 mg in terms of total AUC are presented in SmPC section 5.3 as 
10 and 2.3-fold, respectively. 
In the pivotal EFD study in rabbits two females in the 30 mg/kg dose group (mid dose) were 
euthanised due to abortion and total litter loss (including early and/or late resorptions) and one doe in 
the 10 mg/kg dose group (low dose) had total litter loss (100% late resorptions) at caesarean section 
on GD 29. Furthermore, in the 10 and 75 mg/kg (high dose) dose groups, increases in late resorptions 
and percentage post-implantation were observed. At 75 mg/kg, there was an abrocitinib-related 
increase in the litter and fetal incidences of unossified forelimb phalanges. Given the lack of other 
indications of skeletal dysmorphogenesis noted in this study, the applicant did not consider this 
skeletal observation to be indicative of an adverse effect on fetal development. The litter incidence of 
unossified forelimb phalanges was however increased also at 10 mg/kg. In addition, small increases in 
the litter and fetal incidences of unossified hind limb tarsals and phalanges and of unossified xiphoid 
were observed at all dose level. The skeletal findings observed from 10 mg/kg are not confirmed as 
common findings at the study site or to resolve postnatally and should therefore be considered 
adverse. Thus, it is not possible to set a NOAEL for embryofetal development. A developmental LOAEL 
of 10 mg/kg in rabbits is considered appropriate. The applicant did not consider the increased litter 
incidences of unossified forelimb phalanx at 10 mg/kg, unossified hindlimb phalanx at 75 mg/kg or of 
unossified hindlimb tarsal from 30 mg/kg, which are outside the historical control range, as adverse. 
The applicant considered that the adverse skeletal findings in the rat juvenile toxicity study result from 
delayed ossification in combination with ambulation on underdeveloped bones. Nevertheless, even if 
delayed ossification can be expected to resolve postnatally this has not been shown to occur before 
start of ambulation i.e. potential effects on postnatal bone development cannot be excluded. Whereas 
it is acknowledged that abrocitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy this does not have any impact 
on the developmental LOAEL of 10 mg/kg in the rabbit EFD study which has been adequately reflected 
with its exposure margin of 0.14 to the clinical exposure based on unbound AUC in SmPC section 5.3. 
Adverse developmental toxicity was noted in the PPND study in offspring to dams administered 
abrocitinib at or above 30 mg/kg/day. The entire 60 mg/kg/day dose-group was electively euthanised 
in the study. 7 dams had total litter losses and the remaining 13 dams were euthanised due to low 
viability of the F1 pups. Complete resorptions were noted in two dams at 60 mg/kg/day. Further, 3 
dams (2 at 60 mg/kg/day and 1 dam at 30 mg/kg/day) had dystocia. Bodyweight in the F1-generation 
was reduced at 30 mg/kg/day from PND1 and through weaning up until SD105. Thus, based on the 
dystocia noted in 1♀ and consistently reduced bodyweight in the F1-generation at 30mg/kg/day, the 
NOAEL for both maternal and developmental toxicity was set to 10mg/kg/day. Given that the margin 
to clinical exposure is very low, and that the LOAEL is associated with dystocia or reduced pup viability, 
abrocitinib should not be used during pregnancy. This is also reflected in SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.6. 
Further, the motor activity was reduced in rats (especially females) developmentally exposed to 
abrocitinib. While not statistically significant (due to large variation in the data), a similar effect on 
motor activity was noted in the safety pharmacology study.  From a clinical perspective, no clear 
decrease in steps was noted in the pedometer evaluation included in the human phase I healthy-
volunteer study. Thus, collectively the data available do not support an abrocitinib-induced effect on 
motor activity. 
In the juvenile toxicity study, adverse findings from 25 mg/kg/day included paw malrotation, bent 
bone (tibia), fractures and secondary joint inflammation. From 5 mg/kg/day, small or misshapen 
femoral heads were observed where there was essentially no femoral head or neck present at the 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 41/216 
 
 
 
highest severity level. Further, decreased mineralised cartilage in femur and physis dystrophy in stifle 
joint (decreased primary spongiosa) was present in all abrocitinib exposure groups. Thus, due to the 
functional, macroscopic and microscopic effects on bone (most notably misshapen femoral heads) 
noted at all dose levels no NOAEL could be identified in the present study. 
In the DRF EFD study in rats, fetal external abnormalities in terms of e.g. medially rotated forelimbs 
were observed in 1 fetus from 1 litter in the 75 mg/kg/day group. This may indicate that skeletal 
abnormalities are induced in utero at high dose levels. 
2.5.4.6.  Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Based on an in vitro study in human PBMCs where abrocitinib and tofacitinib were compared in a panel 
of human in vitro assays, no unique activities on parameters of human cellular immune function or 
human cell-mediated host resistance were identified for abrocitinib. 
Metabolites 
Abrocitinib metabolites M1, M2 and M4 were evaluated for their effects on hERG and on the Nav1.5 
(peak current) sodium and Cav1.2 calcium currents. Based on the IC-50 values in the studies, no 
activity of the metabolites is expected on hERG or the Nav1.5 or Cav1.2 ion channels. 
Studies on impurities 
Several impurities were tested in the Ames test for mutagenic potential. Three impurities were 
identified as Ames positive, suggesting that these should be limited to 1.5 µg per person per day 
unless otherwise justified. With a daily dose of 200 mg/day, this corresponds to an acceptable 
concentration limit in the drug product of 7.5 ppm. Impurity PF-07216658 was further evaluated in a 
Big Blue transgenic mouse assay. Statistically increased mutant frequency at the cII gene were seen in 
both the liver and duodenum of Big Blue mice at all doses (i.e. ≥100mgkg/day) supporting that PF-
07216658 is a mutagenic substance. Based on benchmark modelling, a PDE which was established at 
1.36 μg/kg/day corresponding to a concentration limit of 170 ppm. 
Phototoxicity 
A 7-day study in Long-Evans rats was been performed to evaluate the potential for phototoxic effects 
on the eyes and skin after abrocitinib exposure. No findings related to phototoxicity or dermal toxicity 
were evident. This suggests that the phototoxic potential of abrocitinib is low, thus no precautions to 
avoid UV exposure are considered warranted. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based on study data, no PBT assessment was considered needed. Log Kow at pH7 was determined to 
1.85 in an OECD 107 study. However, as the PECSW value was greater than the 0.01 µg/L action limit, 
a Phase II Tier A evaluation was performed. 
Environmental fate 
Based on the OECD 106 study, a geometric mean sludge Kd of 50 was evident. However, for 
Adsorption-Desorption (OECD 106) the use of three types of soils and two types of sludges is 
preferred. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant provided a conclusive justification on the 
number and type of matrices selected for the OECD 106 test which was considered acceptable. 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 42/216 
 
 
 
An estimated small fraction of 0.8 %, may be removed through sorption to sludge. Therefore, sludge 
application to land is not considered to be of concern.  
The degradation rate of abrocitinib across 240d in a water-sediment system was studied in an OECD 
TG308 study. Aqueous dissipation half-life values of 7.5 and 20.9 days resulted under aerobic 
conditions, thus abrocitinib will likely dissipate to sediment, with approximately 25.1 to 28.4% 
becoming irreversibly bound. 
Aquatic and sediment-dweller toxicity 
Chronic aquatic effects of abrocitinib were assessed in green algae, daphnids and fish. 
The green algeae was used for PNECsurfacewater as it was considered the most sensitive species with a 
NOEC of 0.88mg/L.  The PNEC for chronic effects on Chiromomus riparius was 65.3 mg/kg why the 
PNECsed (due to a single study) was 65.3/100 = 0.653. 
Risk characterisation 
The RQ for all measures were below 1, suggesting that abrocitinib at the proposed use is unlikely to 
represent a risk to the environment.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacology was assessed by evaluating the potency, and selectivity of abrocitinib in the 
in vitro assays using purified kinase domains from the JAK family of kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and 
TYK2), and in assays against a broad kinome panel. 
The rat and cynomolgus monkey were selected for investigation of the safety pharmacology and 
toxicity studies. 
Abrocitinib appears to be rather selective against JAK1 compared to the other JAK family members. 
However, in a cellular setting, upon stimulation by divergent cytokine stimuli, the response is 
dependent on JAK signalling pairs, comprising at least two JAK family members. This means that 
inhibition of JAK1 will affect pathways mediated by other JAK family members as well. Hence, the 
relevance of selective enzymatic inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to clinical effect is currently not 
known (see SmPC 5.1). 
Pharmacological activity has been proven in a study on adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) rat, 
symptomatically by dose dependent reduction of paw swelling and functionally by inhibition of STAT 
phosphorylation in ex vivo samples.  
In vitro data on the inhibition by abrocitinib regarding cytokine signalling in whole blood from 
cynomolgus monkey and rat for comparison to previously provided human data were submitted by the 
applicant upon request from the CHMP. The cytokines IL-15 (Jak1/Jak3), IL-12 (Jak2/Tyk2) and 
interferon-α (Jak1/Tyk2) were chosen for stimulation of whole blood. The results showed the following 
inhibitory pattern using IC50 after stimulation by IL-15: 480/537; IL-12: 2660/9730; interferon-α: 
362/183 for cynomolgus monkey and human, respectively. The corresponding figures for IC50 in rat

are for stimulation by IL-15: 87.9; IL-12: 4090; interferon-α: 112. Thus, the activity of abrocitinib on 
the JAK family members is considered sufficient for the selected safety pharmacology/toxicity species 
for comparison to human whole blood. 
Secondary pharmacology was assessed by evaluating the binding potency of abrocitinib against a 
broad panel of receptors, transporters, enzymes, and ion channels in vitro. Follow-up KDR kinase 
(VEGFR2), MAO-A, and MAO-B functional assays were conducted. 
Abrocitinib inhibits EGF at a concentration of 1 µM by 12.3% and at 10 µM, 33.2%. It is agreed that 
the inhibition of EGFR by abrocitinib is not large and in addition, the degree of inhibition is not 
increasing proportionally with increased concentration. The microscopic findings caused by abrocitinib 
inhibition were associated with a decrease in primary spongiosa without affecting the growth plate, 
which is unlike the effects by EGF inhibition. Further, the applicant also highlighted that there are 
differences in the nature of skin lesions in the abrocitinib-treated cynomolgus monkeys (alopecia and 
thinning hair coat) compared to those observed after EGFR inhibition (dry and flaky skin with 
haematoma, petechiae, and histologically disorganised hair follicles). Therefore, it is agreed that the 
provided data does not point out a similar mechanistic effect by abrocitinib as those reported after 
EGFR or VEGFR inhibition. Thus, it is unlikely that the skeletal and skin findings observed in the 
juvenile and toxicity studies are caused by VEGFR or EGFR inhibition.  
The inhibitory potency of abrocitinib was assessed on MAOA and MAOB. MAOB retained the activity by 
98.8% at the highest concentration of abrocitinib, 100 µM. The retained MAOA activity was 67-55% in 
the 1-4 µM range, corresponding to the clinical exposure around Cmax, which for unbound is 1.25 µM 
and for total plasma concentration 3.47 µM, at the clinical dosage of 200 mg. From the subjects that 
had an ongoing psychiatric condition that required treatment, none were treated with MAO-A inhibitor 
antidepressants, indicating that the importance of MAOA inhibition by abrocitinib in the clinical trial has 
not been investigated together with MAOA inhibitors and an additional effect by abrocitinib has thus 
not been explored. However, the low distribution of abrocitinib to brain (approximately 10%), the 
margin of 6.1x the unbound human Cmax at the maximum clinical dose of 200 mg together with the 
fact that the MAOA inhibition is reversible, supports the applicant’s position that the likelihood for 
serotonergic syndrome is unlikely to occur. Thus; CHMP considered that it was not necessary to 
address the MAOA inhibitory effect in the SmPC. 
Overall, the pulmonary parameters were assessed in rat without any observed adverse effects during a 
four-hour post dosing period. In the FOB studies in rat, a decrease in body temperature (at ≥200 
mg/kg) and locomotor activity (≥LOEL, 75 mg/kg) was observed, revealing a margin of approximately 
x10 to the human dosage of 200 mg/day to LOEL. The in vitro studies of hERG and Nav 1.5 inhibition 
by abrocitinib does not suggest any potential effects in clinically relevant concentrations. The safety 
pharmacology studies do thus not indicate any concern from a non-clinical point of view. 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed with abrocitinib. This is 
considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Studies have been performed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 
(ADME) of abrocitinib, using the intended clinical route of administration (oral), and the species 
selected for non-clinical safety testing, i.e. rats and monkeys as the main non-clinical species but also 
mice and rabbits. 
Overall, the non-clinical pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib is considered adequately studied, including the 
chosen strategy and methods for qualification of major metabolites.

The non-clinical toxicity of abrocitinib has been evaluated in a full programme of toxicity studies. 
Expected effects on the immune- and lymphopoietic systems were noted which suggest that increased 
sensitivity to infection and likely tumour development will likely result from abrocitinib exposure in the 
clinical setting. Monkey was used as non-rodent species in the general toxicology programme. 
Nevertheless, the monkey should be, in principle, reserved for situations where no other species is 
considered relevant or useful.  Thus, the applicant was requested by CHMP to justify this species 
choice. Further, the bone effects noted in the rat and the effects on neutrophils noted in rat (and 
human) are examples where no concordance was noted in the monkey studies. Indeed, the 
pharmacological relevance of the monkey was therefore questionable, as no cross-reactivity studies 
with abrocitinib had been presented. As part of its responses, the applicant acknowledged that the use 
of monkey is generally not desired but provided justification for the use of this specie in the 
development programme for abrocitinib.  Monkey had previously been used in the development of 
tofacitinib, another JAKi owned by the applicant, and there was limited experience with other non-
rodent non-clinical species for JAK pharmacology at the time of initiation of the development 
programme for abrocitinib. Overall, given the historical context and the possibility to build on previous 
experience and data from other JAK inhibitors, the use of monkey in the development programme was 
considered sufficiently justified by CHMP. Regarding cross-reactivity data, the activity of abrocitinib on 
the JAK family members in the selected safety pharmacology/toxicity species was presented by the 
applicant. The inhibitory activity and selectivity of abrocitinib on JAK-mediated cytokine signalling were 
evident in the rat and cynomolgus monkey, non-clinical species used in safety pharmacology and 
toxicity studies. This is accepted.  
In the studies in cynomolgus monkey, lymphocyte reductions correlated with reduced thymus weights 
and reduced lymphoid cellularity in thymus and spleen. In the 1-month study, these 
immunosuppressive effects resulted in cytomegalus infection in all males administered 150mg/kg/day. 
No findings of cytomegalovirus were noted in females. While exposure was slightly higher in males in 
the 150mg/kg/day dose group which may signal a more severe immunosuppression, this does not 
explain the difference between the sexes at the individual level as the toxicokinetic data was very 
variable. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant considered that the degree of immunomodulation 
induced by abrocitinib was likely dose-related, which may explain why only monkeys in the 150 
mg/kg/day group had an overimmunosuppression. That said, other abrocitinib independent factors are 
also likely involved in CMV occurrence or reactivation. As a consequence, there is individual variability 
in susceptibility and reactivation of a prior CMS infection which is reflected in the 1-month study in 
monkey. The occurrence of CMV in only males in the study is however less clear, as sex is not a known 
factor involved in CMV reactivation in monkey. Immunocompetence in general is established as a 
sexually dimorphic trait in humans, thus a similar pattern in monkey is conceivable. Further, as it is 
assumed that any obvious differences in environmental factors would have been identified, the 
explanation as outlined by the applicant of the finding to be coincidental is accepted given that the 
group size in monkey studies is limited. Immunophenotyping was performed in the monkey studies.  
In the 9-month study, clear effects were noted on IgA (HD), IgG and IgM in serum. However, only 
individual values have been provided for these measures (which seem to be low). Upon request from 
the CHMP, the applicant provided mean values for IgA, IgG and IgM to support the evaluation of these 
variables. Based on the mean data provided, the overarching conclusion remains from the initial 
assessment that abrocitinib-related effects are noted on IgM and IgA, whereas no meaningful effects 
are noted on IgG levels as a consequence of abrocitinib exposure. 
A KLH study was performed in monkeys from the 9-month study. Abrocitinib exposure gave reduced 
IgG and IgM values (with dose relation) from 15mg/kg/day with partial recovery. While no signs of 
infection were noted in the study, the only partial recovery of the immune system after 2 months 
recovery is of concern. 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 46/216 
 
 
 
Overall, the effects on the lymphopoietic system and immune parameters reflect pharmacological 
effects of the JAK1-inhibition of abrocitinib. This has been adequately reflected in SmPC section 5.3. 
However, while monitorable in the clinic, they ultimately lead to an increased susceptibility to infection 
and is a clear risk-factor for tumour development. Further, no complete recovery of these effect was 
noted in the 9-month study in monkey, and thus should receive further attention in the clinical setting. 
See further discussion in clinical safety and risk management plan sections.  
Effects on bone development were evident in the repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, and in the 
DART studies. These data support that the developing bones and skeleton are susceptible to 
abrocitinib-induced toxicities which currently limits the use of the product in developing children and 
adolescents. While the lack of effects on bone development in 2-4-year-old cynomolgus monkeys may 
be reassuring, the pharmacological relevance of the species for the human situation is currently 
unclear, thus the risks for the developing children and adolescents need to be further addressed. 
Therefore, the applicant was asked to discuss the abrocitinib-induced effects on bone development 
evident in the general toxicology studies in rat (but not in monkey) as well as in the DART programme 
with particular focus on developmental sensitivity, penetrance and toxicokinetics. Further, the risks 
associated with adolescent abrocitinib exposure was to be addressed as well. The applicant provided 
output from preliminary data, literature references and biological reasoning to explain the abrocitinib-
induced effects on bone development evidenced in the non-clinical programme most notably fractures 
and changes associated with bone damage in juvenile rats exposed from postnatal day 10 to ≥ 0.8 
times the AUC at the MRHD. While some of the data fit the applicant’s explanation of an abrocitinib-
induced developmental delay in combination with ambulation on underdeveloped bones, the dramatic 
bone effects after just a few days of administration could point to a potential direct effect of abrocitinib 
on developing bones. The lack of similar effects in cynomolgus monkeys, representative of children 
aged 8 years and above may be reassuring and aligned with the applicant’s explanation that the most 
critical parts in bone development in primates (including humans) occurs earlier (prenatally) than in 
rodents. Nevertheless, given that postnatal development of long bones continues up into adolescence 
in both monkey and humans, an uncertainty regarding a possible effect on cartilage mineralisation in 
actively growing bones by abrocitinib remains, and thus should receive further clinical attention, in 
particular for a future broadening of indication to younger children. This is further discussed in the 
clinical safety section.  
Dystocia and reduced viability in early postnatal life was noted in pups to mothers who had been 
exposed to abrocitinib throughout pregnancy. In combination with embryo-lethality and skeletal effects 
in the FEED and/or EFD studies with low exposure margins to clinical exposure this suggest that the 
product should not be used during pregnancy and lactation. Further, while the pregnancies disclosed in 
the clinical section are limited in number, they are not indicating a safe use of abrocitinib use during 
pregnancy. Other JAK-inhibitors in the class are contraindicated for use in pregnancy, and collectively 
the data presented support that the same labelling should be used also for abrocitinib. This was agreed 
by the applicant. Abrocitinib is therefore contraindicated in pregnancy and breast feeding as reflected 
in SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.6. Further, adequate risk minimisation measures and pharmacovigilance 
activities are included in the RMP to address the risk of foetal malformation following exposure in utero 
(see RMP Section). 
Overall, the genotoxicity studies presented do not indicate a genotoxic risk for abrocitinib at the 
proposed clinical dose of 200mg QD. This information has been appropriately reflected in SmPC section 
5.3.  
Thymomas in the 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats were evident already at the lowest dose, with 
low margins of exposure to human exposure. The applicant was asked to further discuss the findings 
and the clinical relevance. In the response, the applicant argued that background incidence from 
literature suggest that incidence in Wistar rat may be as high as 18%, thus the thymoma findings in 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 47/216 
 
 
 
the 3mg/kg group is not considered treatment related. This was not agreed by CHMP who was of the 
view that that the thymomas were treatment related. Further, only one case of malignant thymoma 
was noted in the study (in the 10mg/kg dose group) which does not suggest a treatment-related 
increase. However, it is unclear to what extent there can be progression from a benign thymoma to a 
malignant thymoma and the tumour biology underlying such a shift. While the applicant did not discuss 
this issue, it was agreed by CHMP that the single occurrence of malignant lymphoma may reflect a low 
progression.  
Further, the increase in thymoma incidence was noted in female rats and from exposures around 
clinical exposure whereas no apparent increase was apparent in male rats up to 14x unbound human 
AUC. The reason for this sex difference is unclear, but the applicant referenced studies suggesting that 
thymuses of female Wistar Han rats exhibit a more delayed physiologic thymic involution than males or 
other rat strains and that a higher frequency of spontaneous thymoma formation in Wistar rats is 
related to higher numbers of thymocytes at baseline and higher proliferation rates of TECs. This then 
may lead to a higher sensitivity for thymoma formation in the female Wistar rat following 
administration of an immunosuppressive drug such as abrocitinib. Overall this explanation regarding 
increase female sensitivity is acceptable. Thus, it was agreed that abrocitinib treatment seems to 
accelerate the thymoma formation in the rat. 
The human risk for abrocitinib-induced thymoma is currently unclear. Other immunosuppressive 
treatments have induced thymomas in cancer studies but there is according to the applicant currently 
no clinical evidence suggesting an increased risk for human thymoma development. Nevertheless, 
given the unclear human relevance of the thymoma findings, the applicant included data in section 5.3 
of the SmPC.  
ERA 
Finally, ERA studies consistently produced RQ-values below 1, therefore abrocitinib is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. According to the performed risk assessment, CHMP agreed that no 
specific requirements for disposal have to be included in the SmPC. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the applicant provided a comprehensive evaluation of pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic 
and toxicologic properties of abrocitinib. The issues identified in the non-clinical programme have been 
properly addressed. Studies in animals have shown reproductive and skeletal toxicities. The impact on 
bone development is further discussed in the clinical sections. Abrocitinib is contraindicated in 
pregnancy and breast feeding. Women of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective 
contraception during treatment and for 1 month following the final dose of abrocitinib. Abrocitinib is 
therefore considered approvable from a non-clinical point.

Plasma and urine concentrations of abrocitinib and plasma concentrations of its metabolites M1, M2 
and M4 were determined with validated LC-MS/MS methods. 
•  Non-compartment data analysis 
Standard non-compartment analysis was performed in all studies where rich sampling was applied. 
•  Evaluation and Qualification of Models  
Objectives of the population PK analysis 
popPK analysis at time of initial submission: 
1.  Describe the PK of abrocitinib (PF-04965842) in healthy subjects, moderate to severe psoriasis 
(PsO) patients and moderate to severe AD patients. 
2.  Identify potential covariates in the study population(s) which account for variability in 
abrocitinib exposure. 
3.  Assess the relative bioavailability of abrocitinib doses and formulations administered during 
clinical development. 
4.  Provide individual-level estimates of PK parameters for subsequent exposure-response 
analyses 
popPk analysis (updated) upon request from CHMP 
1.  Update the previous population PK model developed for abrocitinib (PMAR-EQDD-B745d-DP4-
962) with PK samples from five additional studies 
2.  Develop a combined population PK model for abrocitinib and three of its metabolites (M1, M2, 
and M4) 
Dataset (popPK analysis at time of initial submission): 
All studies during the clinical development programme that sampled abrocitinib (PF-04965842) 
concentrations, which were available prior to conclusion of the population PK modelling analysis, were 
included. Therefore, studies B7451014, B7451021 and B7451032 were not included. Additionally, 
B7451008 (human absorption, metabolism and excretion (ADME) study using14C micro-tracer) was 
not included due its complex study design.

Table 4 Summary of Observed Concentrations in Analysis Population by Dose 
Data handling 
Individuals that did not receive at least one dose of abrocitinib or did not have at least one measurable 
concentration (with correct dosing and time information) were excluded from this analysis. Missing 
values for covariates assumed the population median or mode value (for continuous or categorical 
variables, respectively) during covariate analysis. 
Software 
Model development used NONMEMR Version VII Level 4.3 (ICON Dev. Soln, Ellicott City,MD, USA).  
Method model development 
The structural model development was based on selecting models with regards to Akaike information 
criterion (AIC). 
Structural covariates known to be highly influential a priori were built into the structural model: 
Weight via allometric scaling on PK parameters. Known DDI effects on CL/F and bioavailability (F) on 
abrocitinib (rifampin, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, and probenecid). Dose, formulation and food effects on 
absorption parameters (F, ka, k0, duration of zero-order absorption process (Tk0), Ak1, ALAG1,

Stepwise covariate modelling approach: 
1.  Full model determined at the end of forward inclusion procedures to generate forest plots that 
summarize the impact of covariates on abrocitinib exposure metrics.   
2.  Final model determined by backwards elimination from the full model, to be used for the 
purpose of simulations.

Updated Final popPK model 
The population PK model was developed using non-linear mixed effects methods and NONMEMR 7.5.0. 
A sequential approach was used where the parent abrocitinib model was updated followed by the 
development of the metabolite model.  
Updated parent popPK model 
The prior abrocitinib model was updated using a new analysis dataset that included the following 
studies: B7451014 (Phase 3 study in AD patients), B7451021 (renal impairment study), B7451028 
(China PK Study), and B7451032 (pivotal bioequivalence (BE) and food effect study), and Study

B7451036 (Phase 3 study in adolescent AD patients). The abrocitinib dataset included 262 healthy 
volunteers and 2034 patients.  
The final model for abrocitinib was re-estimated with an adjustment to the formulation and race 
parameters, using all available abrocitinib PK samples. Studies B7451032 and B7451036 used a new 
formulation not studied in the previous model. The race parameter was adjusted to estimate an effect 
for Asian race and Other race separately rather than a combined effect.  
There was no additional covariate development to the abrocitinib model other than the changes to the 
formulation and race parameters as previously described. No additional model building with respect to 
covariate effects was conducted. Final model parameter estimates are shown in the table below. VPCs 
for adults and adolescents are shown in the figures below.

Metabolite model 
Post hoc estimates for each individual from the parent model were used for the metabolite model. 
During parent/metabolite model development, all analytes were converted to molar. A stepwise 
covariate modelling approach was used in this analysis to develop the metabolite model. The applicant 
stated assumptions and limitations regarding the metabolite model: 
The patient metabolite information was available from only 51 AD patients and consisted of a single 
sample collected roughly 2 hours post dose. Of these 51 patients, only 7 were adolescents. 
Consequently, it was assumed that there were no differences in the metabolite PK beyond the 
differences incorporated in the abrocitinib model for both patient and adolescents. Additionally, the 
final model included 38 fixed effect parameters and 10 random effect parameters with a moderately 
high condition number. A scaling effect was added to the parameterisation of the abrocitinib clearance 
resulted in an overestimation of the abrocitinib AUC if simulated directly from the metabolite model. 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of abrocitinib following a single 200 mg oral dose was 60% (90% CI of 
[46%, 78%]) and the fraction absorbed is high, 91%. 
Single and multiple doses of 3mg up to 800mg have been studied. The absorption of abrocitinib is 
rapid with maximum plasma concentrations occurring generally between 0.5 and 1.5 hours after single 
and repeated doses, see Figure 5. 
Figure 5 Median plasma PF-04965842 concentration-time profiles following multiple doses 
in healthy western and Japanese subject from study B7451001. 
Abrocitinib is a substrate for both P-gp and BCRP in vitro. The fraction absorbed in human is close to 
90% and inhibition of these transporters is unlikely to meaningfully increase the abrocitinib exposures 
at therapeutic doses.

The in vitro solubility of abrocitinib is pH dependent. At pH values >4.0, the compound demonstrates 
the characteristics of a low-solubility compound and thus dissolves more slowly. 
•  Bioequivalence 
The bioequivalence of a single 200 mg dose of the commercial tablet formulation of abrocitinib relative 
to the phase-3 tablet formulation has been evaluated under fasting conditions using a replicate design. 
The standard BE criteria were met and the within subject variability was approximately 32%.  
A biowaiver for the additional strengths 50 and 100 mg has been proposed. 
• 
Food interaction 
Abrocitinib AUC and Cmax was increased approximately 26 and 29% and there was a delay in the 
Tmax (by 2 hours) when a 200 mg dose of the commercial tablet formulation was administered with a 
high-fat breakfast as compared to administration in the fasted state. In the phase-3 studies abrocitinib 
was administered irrespective of food and no food restrictions are included in the SmPC. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 100.2 L (19%) after an IV microtracer dose 
[14C]abrocitinib. The Vz/F was 235.3 L (31%) (geometric mean [CV%]), after the oral abrocitinib dose 
co-administered with the 14C-labeled IV tracer dose. 
Plasma protein binding of 0.1-10 µM of abrocitinib and its metabolites was determined by equilibrium 
dialysis. The fu values for abrocitinib, M1, M2, and M4 were 0.36, 0.63, 0.71, and 0.83, respectively. 
The mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 1.07, 1.13, 1.27, and 0.87 for abrocitinib, M1, M2, and M4 
respectively.  
Elimination 
The main route of elimination for abrocitinib is metabolism. In the mass balance study (IV tracer dose) 
total CL for abrocitinib was 1073 ml/min. The apparent clearance (CL/F) after the oral administration 
was 1794 ml/min. Renal CL of abrocitinib was calculated as 11 ml/min. Approximately 94.5% of the 
radioactivity was recovered of the total administered radioactive dose, 85% was recovered in urine and 
9,5 % in faeces. Less than 1% (0.6%) of the dose was excreted as unchanged abrocitinib in urine and 
0.3% in faeces. The terminal elimination half-life was generally estimated between 1,5-6 hours. Under 
steady state conditions, the elimination half-life was between 3-6 hours. 
•  Metabolism 
Abrocitinib is extensively metabolised. In vitro results indicate that the metabolism of abrocitinib is 
mediated by multiple CYP enzymes, CYP2C19 (~53%), CYP2C9 (~30%), CYP3A4 (~11%) and CYP2B6 
(~6%). Abrocitinib was the predominant component (approximately 26% of plasma radioactivity) in 
systemic circulation after oral administration. Single oxidative metabolites M1 (11.3%), M2 (12.4%) 
and M4 (13.8%) were also observed as major components of circulating profiled radioactivity. Several 
other minor metabolites were also identified. In urine the most abundant component was metabolites 
M1, M2, M3, M4 and M6. Of the 3 metabolites in circulation, M1 and M2 have similar JAK inhibitory 
profiles as abrocitinib, while M4 was pharmacologically inactive. M1 was estimated to contribute 11% 
and M2 47% to the in vivo activity. The sum of unbound exposures of abrocitinib, M1 and M2, each 
expressed in molar units and adjusted for relative potencies, is referred to as the abrocitinib active 
moiety.

Abrocitinib, while chiral, contains two identical substituted stereo-centres and is therefore a meso 
compound. There is no indication that inter-conversion of abrocitinib occurs in vivo.

Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
The plasma concentration-time profile of abrocitinib and metabolites at steady state can be seen in 
figure 7. The elimination phases of the metabolites are in parallel with that for the parent drug at 
steady state suggesting formation-rate limited PK of these 3 metabolites. In this study (1043) the half-
life of abrocitinib after multiple doses was 6.0 h and of M1, M2 and M4 6.2 h, 4.6 h and 5.8 h 
respectively. Tmax was 1.5 hours for abrocitinib and M1 and 2 hours for M2 and M4.

Figure 7 The plasma concentration-time profile of abrocitinib and metabolites at steady 
state (B7471043). 
The metabolites are predominantly renally excreted and substrates of the renal transporter protein 
OAT3. Multiple CYP-enzymes have been indicated in the metabolism pathways of the metabolites. 
•  Consequence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms 
Genotyping was performed for CYP2C19 (*1, *2, *3, *4 and *17) and CYP2C9 (*1, *2 and*3) in 
several of the phase-1 studies to evaluate the effect of poor and extensive metabolizers of either gene. 
A linear mixed effects model was used to evaluate the phenotypes effect on abrocitinib AUC and Cmax. 
Using an overall phenotype (a combination of both CYP2C19 and 2C9 phenotype) no relevant 
differences in abrocitinib exposure are found between different phenotypes (for AUC a 19.5% decrease 
for elevated phenotype and a 25.6% increase for reduced phenotype). No genotyping was performed 
in the phase-3 studies. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Several different methods have been used to evaluate dose dependency of abrocitinib, all indicating a 
more than proportional increase in AUC with dose over the whole dose range (3-800 mg) but with 
some differences regarding the range showing dose proportionality. However, dose proportionality is 
expected within the clinically relevant dose range up to 400 mg once daily. Linear dose proportionality 
was observed for the active moiety for 100 mg QD and 200 mg single dose. 
Rss values (AUCτ/AUCinf) were approximately 1.3-1.5, suggesting that there may be greater than 
linear increase in abrocitinib exposure with multiple-dose administration. Based on observed half-life of 
approximately 5 hours, the accumulation ratio after QD dosing is predicted to be approximately 1.04. 
Time- and dose-dependent changes in bioavailability and clearance were implemented in the popPK 
model to describe the observed higher than predicted accumulation in abrocitinib concentrations 
following repeated dosing and greater than proportional increases in area under the curve (AUC) at 
higher doses.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The intra-subject %CV was low (<10%) for the AUCinf and 32% for Cmax at the highest clinical dose 
of 200 mg. Inter-individual variability for AUC and Cmax appears moderate to high (%CV for both AUC 
and Cmax varied 30-75%). In the final population PK model, the inter-individual variability was 
estimated to be 57.7% on CL and 41.4% on Vc. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The final updated popPK model predicted population-typical value of steady-state Cmax and 24-hour 
AUC following 200 mg QD dosing, for parent drug. Infectious and inflammatory disease states have 
been shown to alter activities and expression of drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes, 
such as CYP.

Special populations 
Renal impairment 
A renal impairment (RI) study investigating the effect of moderate (eGFR 30 to< 60 mL/min) and 
severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min) RI on abrocitinib PK has been performed. RI did affect the abrocitinib 
exposure. The overall exposure of abrocitinib as measured by geometric mean AUCinf increased by 
83% and 21% in participants with moderate and severe RI, respectively, compared to that in 
participants with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min). Increases in AUCinf for the moderate and 
severe RI groups were 54% and 187%, for M1, respectively and 170% and 471%, for M2 and 208% 
and 442% for M4. The Cmax of the active moiety increased with approximately 30% in both moderate 
and severe RI compared to subjects with normal renal function. The mean AUCinf,u values in 
participants with moderate and severe RI increased by 110% and 191%, respectively, compared to 
that in participants with normal renal function. Through extrapolation using the linear regression 
function a patient with an eGFR of 60 ml/min (mild renal impairment) is predicted to have an increase 
in active moiety exposure of about 70%. The use of abrocitinib has not been studied in patients with 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on renal replacement therapy.

Hepatic impairment  
Mild (Child Pugh A) and moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment (HI) has been studied. Abrocitinib 
AUC increased 1.3 and 1.5-fold respectively while Cmax was unchanged. For the metabolites M1 and 
M2 the reduced exposure was observed while the exposure of M4 is not affected to any relevant extent 
by hepatic impairment. The metabolite-to-parent exposure ratios for all 3 metabolites decreased in 
participants with mild and moderate hepatic impairment compared to participants with normal hepatic 
function. The effect on the active moiety is low. AUCinf increases 4 and 15 % for mild and moderate HI 
respectively, while Cmax decreases 25 and 15% in the respective group. No dose-adjustments are 
proposed for mild or moderate HI. Severe (Child Pugh C) HI has not been studied and the use of 
abrocitinib is contraindicated in this population. 
Table 9 Pharmacokinetic results of abrocitinib and its active moiety for intrinsic factors 
Elderly 
Age is correlated to renal function and elderly are likely to have renal impairment and dose may need 
to be reduced according to renal function.  
Gender 
Gender was evaluated as covariate in the population PK modelling. Female participants had a greater F 
than male participants. However, simulations from the model showed no difference in overall exposure.  
Race 
Study 1001 evaluated abrocitinib exposure in Japanese subjects. At a single 800 mg dose, the 
geometric mean Cmax was similar in Western and Japanese subjects. However, geometric mean 
AUCinf was 26% higher in Western subjects than that observed in Japanese subjects. Geometric mean 
Cmax and AUCtau following multiple-dose administration of 200mg BID were 17% and 56% higher, 
respectively, in the Western subjects than in Japanese subjects. The popPK analysis also indicate a 50 
% higher AUC in Asians/other compared to White, adult males of 70 kg. 
Adolescents 
No data is available for children below 12 years. Based on the updated popPK analysis the exposure is 
similar between adolescents and adults.

Special populations conclusions 
It is agreed that body weight, gender, race and age did not have a clinically meaningful effect on 
abrocitinib exposure, and this is reflected in the SmPC. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Abrocitinib is metabolised by multiple CYP-enzymes, mainly 2C19 and 2C9 and to a lesser extent 3A4 
and 2B6 and multiple CYPs have been indicated in the metabolism of each metabolite as well. 
Abrocitinib is a substrate for p-gp and BCRP while all metabolites are substrates of OAT3. Abocitinib 
has not been evaluated as a substrate for renal transporters due to its low renal excretion, conversely 
the metabolites have only been evaluated as substrates for renal transporters as this is their main 
elimination route. 
Abrocitinib and all three main metabolites has been evaluated for their potential as inhibitors and 
inducers of all mandatory CYP enzymes. In vitro abrocitinib was a time-dependent inhibitor (TDI) of 
CYP3A4, 2D6 and 2C19 in the presence of NADPH. The metabolites showed TDI signals for CYP3A4 and 
2D6 at concentrations above the cut-offs. Neither abrocitinib nor the metabolites were direct inhibitors 
of any CYP-enzyme investigated in vitro. Abrocitinib was an inducer of CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C19, 2B6 and 
1A2 at the mRNA level. M1 and M2 were inducers of CYP3A4 and M2 also for 2B6. Further, abrocitinib 
was not an inhibitor of UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 or SULT1E1, 1A1 and 2A1. 
Abrocitinib and all three main metabolites has been evaluated for their potential as inhibitors of all 
mandatory transporter proteins. In vitro abrocitinib was an inhibitor of p-gp, BCRP, OAT3, OCT1, 
MATE1 and MATE2k. Neither metabolite was an inhibitor of any transporter protein at relevant 
concentrations. 
In vivo- abrocitinib as a victim 
Fluconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19 and moderate inhibitor of 2C9 and 3A4 increased abrocitinib 
AUC 4.8-fold and Cmax 1.9-fold and the half-life was prolonged following fluconazole treatment, 3.1 vs 
6.1 hours. Fluvoxamine, a strong CYP2C19 and moderate 3A4 inhibitor increased abrocitinib AUC 2.8-
fold and Cmax 1.8-fold. The half-life was somewhat longer following fluvoxamine treatment, 5.2 vs 4.3 
hours. This confirms the importance of these enzymes in abrocitinib metabolism. The exposure of 
active moiety increased by 1.9- and 1.3-fold (AUC and Cmax respectively) for fluvoxamine and 2.5- 
and 1.2-fold (AUC and Cmax respectively) for fluconazole. 
Further, rifampin a strong inducer of several CYPs as well as p-gp decreased abrocitinib exposure with 
almost 90% and a shorter half-life of 2.1 hour with rifampin vs 4.3 hours without. The active moiety 
AUC decreased by 56% and the Cmax decreased by 31%. 
Probenecid, an inhibitor of OAT3, increased abrocitinib exposure slightly (ca 30%) while as expected 
M1, M2 and M4 increased more, by 77%, 125% and 117% respectively. The unbound AUC and Cmax 
of the active moiety increased 1.7- and 1.3-fold respectively.

In vivo- abrocitinib as a perpetrator 
Given the in vitro signal of TDI and induction of CYP3A4 the applicant has investigated multiple doses 
of abrocitinib on midazolam exposure. At day 2 there was an approximately 16% decrease in 
midazolam AUC and Cmax. At day 7 there was an approximately 7% decrease in midazolam AUC and 
Cmax compared to midazolam being administrated alone. 
In a study investigating the effect of multiple doses of abrocitinib on oral contraceptives, the AUCinf 
and Cmax values for ethinyl estradiol (EE) increased by approximately 19% and 7%, respectively, as 
compared to EE administration alone. No effect was seen on levonorgestrel AUC while Cmax decreased 
by 14%. 
The exposure of dabigatran etexilate (p-gp substrate) increased approximately 1.5-fold after co-
administration of a single 200 mg dose of abrocitinib. 
No effect was seen on the exposure or on the renal clearance of either rosuvastatin (BCRP, OAT3, and 
OATP1s) or metformin (MATE1/2k) after co-administration with abrocitinib. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Abrocitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK)1 inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals 
arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence 
cellular processes of haematopoiesis and immune cell function. JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal 
Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including 
gene expression. Inhibition of JAK1 modulates the signalling pathways by preventing the 
phosphorylation and activation of STATs.  
In biochemical assays, abrocitinib has selectivity for JAK1 over the other 3 JAK isoforms JAK2 (28-
fold), JAK3 (> 340-fold) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2, 43-fold). In cellular settings, it preferentially 
inhibits cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation by signalling pairs involving JAK1, and spares 
signalling by JAK2/JAK2, or JAK2/TYK2 pairs. The relevance of selective enzymatic inhibition of specific 
JAK enzymes to clinical effect is not currently known.

The analyses are briefly described below.  
Conc-QT modelling 
A pre-specified linear mixed effects model was used in the concentration-QTc analysis. The model-
predicted population-typical therapeutic Cmax at steady state after 200-mg QD dosing was 1123 
ng/mL for adult patients with AD and the supratherapeutic concentrations in AD patients was set at 
2757 ng/mL. The conc-QT modelling indicated the lack of a clinically relevant effect on QTc interval for 
the defined supratherapeutic concentrations, however at supratherapeutic concentration of around 
3000 ng/mL (around 3-fold increase) the model predicts clinically relevant effect on QTc. QT-is further 
discussed in clinical safety section.

platelet counts (170,000/μL and 220,000/μL) demonstrated higher net percentage decreases in

Exposure-response 
Two models were developed to evaluate the effect of abrocitinib on the main co-primary endpoints of 
the phase 3 studies (IGA and EASI). In general, the results are in line with the results presented in the 
efficacy section. 
EASI 
This model was able to adequately capture the profile of the EASI scores, including the rapid decrease 
for patients on treatment. In addition, the EASI-75 and EASI-90 rates across doses were accurately 
predicted. The 100-mg, 200-mg dose, and the 200-mg QD open-label QD dosing regimens showed 
meaningful efficacy in the expected percentage decrease in EASI scores from baseline, as well as high 
rates of patients achieving EASI-75 and EASI-90. With open-label dosing, responses were greater 
compared to double-blind dosing. 
IGA 
A longitudinal exposure-response model for the IGA score for each subject was developed. The Cavg 
(parent drug) was used as the measurement of exposure in the model. The responses compared to 
exposures shows that the Cavg is higher for responders versus non-responders at the end-of-study visit 
(Figure 10). 
The 100 mg QD, 200 mg QD, and the 200 mg QD open-label dosing regimens both showed meaningful 
improvements in efficacy with higher average exposure. significantly associated with a higher 
probability of achieving an IGA response after 12 weeks of treatment. Both the 100 mg and 200 mg QD 
dosing regimens showed clinically meaningful improvements in the IGA response rate. When the patient 
knows they are taking the active treatment, the response to treatment was significantly higher. Patients 
with high baseline BGA has a lower predicted probability of response compared to reference.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Abrocitinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) available in 50, 100 and 200 
mg film-coated tablets. The clinical effect is mediated by an active moiety which encompasses two 
identified pharmacologically active metabolites of abrocitinib. The applicant has justified that for the 
average AD patient 200 mg would be the starting dose. Based on the increased exposure of the active 
moiety, dose adjustments are proposed in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (RI), 
patients ≥65 years of age and patients receiving concomitant use of strong CYP2C-inhibitors.

Abrocitinib is a weak base which exhibits pH-dependent solubility. At pH values >4.0, the compound 
demonstrates the characteristics of a low-solubility compound and thus dissolves more slowly. The 
effect of substances that increases the gastric pH on abrocitinib absorption has not been studied. Upon 
request from the CHMP, the applicant agreed to conduct a DDI-study of abrocitinib used concomitantly 
with a product that increase gastric pH. The results of this study will be submitted as a post-approval 
type II variation (Q1 2022). Information regarding concomitant use with substances that increases the 
gastric pH is included in the SmPC section 4.5, until the results of this study is available. 
Abrocitinib is absorbed rapidly with a median Tmax around 1 hour. The fraction absorbed is high, 91%, 
while the absolute bioavailability is moderate, 60%. Over the dose range 30-800 mg different analyses 
indicate a more than proportional increase in AUC with dose, which in individual studies was obvious at 
400 mg. However, in the clinically relevant interval between 50 and 200 mg, dose proportionality was 
shown. Time to steady state is 48 hours. A high-fat meal increased the bioavailability of the 
commercial formulation slightly (AUC and Cmax increased by approximately 26% and 29%, 
respectively, and Tmax was prolonged by 2 hours). This not considered clinically relevant. Further, in 
clinical studies, abrocitinib was administered without regard to food.  The commercial formulation is 
bioequivalent to the formulation used in the phase-3 studies as well as in the majority of the clinical 
pharmacology studies.  
After IV dosing, the steady-state Vss of abrocitinib was estimated to be 100.2 L, suggesting 
distribution into tissues. The fraction unbound was approximately 0.36, 0.63, 0.83 and 0.71 for 
abrocitinib, M1, M2 and M4 respectively in a clinically relevant concentration range. 
Abrocitinib is extensively metabolised. Abrocitinib was the predominant component (approximately 
26% of plasma radioactivity) in systemic circulation after oral administration. Single oxidative 
metabolites M1 (11.3%), M2 (12.4%) and M4 (13.8%) were also observed as major components of 
circulating profiled radioactivity. Several other minor metabolites were also identified. Of the 3 
metabolites in circulation, M1 and M2 have similar JAK inhibitory profiles as abrocitinib, while M4 was 
pharmacologically inactive. M1 was estimated to contribute 11% and M2 47% to the in vivo activity. 
The sum of unbound exposures of abrocitinib, M1 and M2, each expressed in molar units and adjusted 
for relative potencies, is referred to as the abrocitinib active moiety. The PK profiles of the metabolites 
have been observed to be parallel to that of the parent drug in healthy individuals.  
In vitro results indicate that the metabolism of abrocitinib is mediated by multiple CYP enzymes, 
CYP2C19 (~53%), CYP2C9 (~30%), CYP3A4 (~11%) and CYP2B6 (~6%). The importance of 2C19, 
2C9 and 3A4 has been confirmed by in vivo studies. The consequences of genetic polymorphism have 
been evaluated using pooled data from the phase-1 studies. Using an overall phenotype (a 
combination of both CYP2C19 and 2C9 phenotype) no relevant differences in abrocitinib exposure are 
found between different phenotypes, indicating that other enzymatic pathways may overcome the loss 
of function in another pathway (or that the contribution of CYP2C19 and 2C9 is less in vivo than 
indicated by in vitro data). However, few individuals being classified as poor metaboliser of either 
enzyme were included in the analysis. As the DDI-studies with CYP inhibitors were performed using 
inhibitors (fluconazole and fluvoxamine) that are also moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (in addition to 
inhibitors of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9) and these studies showed a much greater effect on abrocitinib 
exposure (4.8-fold increase for fluconazole) compared to the phenotype data exploring only the effect 
of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 (30% increase), the in vivo contribution of the indicated CYPs to abrocitinib 
metabolism is not entirely clear. The fact that multiple enzymes are involved in the metabolism and 
may step in when one pathway is incapacitated is reassuring, thus no further studies are requested.  
The exposure of abrocitinib is considerably affected by certain strong CYP-inhibitors and inducers, the 
effect is as expected less for the active moiety. In patients with renal impairment (RI) the effect is the 
opposite, abrocitinib exposure is not affected to such a large extent while the exposure of the

metabolites M1 and M2 indeed are, resulting in the exposure of the active moiety being increased more 
than that of abrocitinib. The applicant has discussed the therapeutic window and based the upper limit 
mainly on experience of the approximately 750 patients with mild renal impairment (defined as eGFR 
60-90 ml/min) included in the phase-3 studies. The efficacy and safety for patients with mild renal 
impairment is considered acceptable. In a subgroup analysis of patients with mild RI, no obvious trend 
of more AEs in the group with lower eGFR was apparent. It can therefore be accepted that a 1.7-fold 
exposure is acceptable.  
In vitro abrocitinib was a time-dependent inhibitor (TDI) and inducer of CYP2C19 the in vivo relevance 
of this will be evaluated in a planned DDI study. The results of this study will be submitted as a post 
approval type II variation (1H 2022). Information regarding the potential risk for interaction is included 
in the SmPC, until the results of this study are available. 
The in vitro induction signals for CYP1A2 and 2B6 are now reflected in the SmPC and a clinical DDI 
study investigating the induction potential is planned. The results of this study will be submitted as a 
post approval type II variation (1H 2022). 
In the mass balance study (IV tracer dose) total CL for abrocitinib was 1073 ml/min. Renal CL of 
abrocitinib was calculated as approximately 11 ml/min. The elimination half-life is around 5 hours. 
Abrocitinib is mainly (approximately 85%) excreted via urine, and to a low extend (9.5%) via faeces. 
Unchanged drug was less than 1% and 0.3% of the dose in urine and faeces, respectively. 
Upon request from CHMP, the applicant provided an updated popPK analysis for both parent drug and 
metabolites. The popPK model has some issues, it is over parameterised and some of the pcVPC for 
the parent drug show model misspecification, mainly round 8-12 h after dose. The stratified pcVPCs for 
adolescent and adult for the relevant doses (100 mg and 200 mg) appear acceptable. While the data 
for the 200mg dose seem comparable, slightly lower concentrations are observed in adolescents 
compared to adults for the 100mg dose. No new covariate modelling was conducted for parent drug in 
the updated popPK analysis. Thus, adolescent as a covariate on F remains but the covariate effect is 
estimated to be lower than previously. Nevertheless, this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP 
as the product is currently not indicated in adolescents.  
The joint metabolite model was not considered satisfactory. However, drawing conclusions on parent 
drug for adolescents based on parent drug for adults only is deemed adequate and despite some 
shortcomings of the updated parent popPK model, it is not expected for a flat dose, that adolescent 
patients would have much lower exposure than adults. Adolescent may have slightly higher clearance 
per kg but they also have lower body weight. The side by side VPCs for adults and adolescent for the 
relevant doses (100 and 200 mg) appear acceptable. Further, in the figure with observed PK data for 
adults and adolescents, the data were largely overlapping, providing some additional support that 
exposure is similar in adolescents and adults. The SmPC has been updated with an acceptable 
description of exposure in adolescents. 
Please also see clinical efficacy section for further discussion on efficacy in adolescents. 
In the dedicated renal impairment (RI) study the exposure of the active moiety increased 
approximately 3-fold in patients with severe (RI) and 2-fold in patients with moderate RI. For both 
groups the dose is proposed to be reduced by half. Subjects with mild renal impairment have not been 
studied. Through extrapolation using a linear regression function a patient with an eGFR of 60 ml/min 
is predicted to have an increase in active moiety of about 1.7-fold. This is reflected in the SmPC.  
Treatment recommendations for patients with severe/moderate renal impairment are based on (full) 
extrapolation informed by modelling. For patients with moderate RI, the dose adjustment proposed by 
the applicant in SmPC section 4.2 is considered satisfactory with exposure similar to patients with 
normal renal function. 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 72/216 
 
 
 
Comparison of active moiety exposure at the 100 mg QD dose in moderate or severe RI patients to the 
200 mg QD dose in normal renal function patients demonstrates that there is a trend of higher 
exposures in patients with severe RI. Further, there is no clinical trial experience in patients with eGFR 
<30 mL/min and only very little in patients with eGFR ≤40 mL/min of whom a few were included in 
phase I studies (not in phase II or III). The PMAR-1110 model is however considered sufficiently 
robust to approach/predict exposure also in a population with eGFR ≤40 mL/min. Nevertheless, the 
applicant has proposed a more conservative wording in SmPC section 4.2 for patients with severe renal 
impairment to accommodate for uncertainties with the extrapolation approach which is acceptable. 
Abrocitinib has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on renal replacement 
therapy.  
A dose-response Phase 2 b study (B7451006) with abrocitinib 10, 30, 100 and 200 mg and placebo 
dosed once daily was performed in adult subjects with AD. No statistical difference compared with 
placebo was observed for the two lowest doses 10 mg and 30 mg in either clinical endpoint (IGA or 
EASI-75) investigated. Both 100 mg and 200 mg of abrocitinib resulted in a statistically significant 
higher proportion of IGA responders and percent change from baseline in EASI score at week 12 
compared with treatment with placebo and thus supports the doses chosen for the pivotal Phase 3 
studies. 
Similarly, the modelling of exposure-response for phase 2b and phase 3 data, indicate that both 100 
mg and 200 mg have a relevant effect and that the 200 mg provide higher probability of IGA response 
than 100 mg. Patients with high baseline BGA had a lower predicted probability of response compared 
to reference. This indicate that these patients may warrant the higher 200 mg start dose.  
In none of the presented studies the 50mg dose has been administered and only limited data is 
available for dose level below 100mg. The closest studied dose is 30mg for which only limited data 
from healthy volunteers is available. From the provided data it is currently doubted that relevant 
plasma concentrations might be reached with a dose of 50 mg in regular AD patients. However, dose 
reduction to 50 mg is only recommended for patients with increased exposure caused either by 
impairment or co-medication. In patients with normal renal function, the text in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC was updated to clarify the intended starting dose. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Abrocitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK)1 inhibitor which reversibly and selectively inhibits JAK1 by blocking 
the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. In a cell-free isolated enzyme assay, abrocitinib has 
biochemical selectivity for JAK1 over the other 3 JAK isoforms JAK2 (28-fold), JAK3 (> 340-fold) and 
TYK 2 (43-fold).  
In the performed phase 2b dose-response study (B7451006) 10 mg and 30 mg of abrocitinib had no 
significant clinical efficacy in the target population, patients with moderate to severe AD. A dose-
dependent statistically significant efficacy was observed for 100 mg and 200 mg of abrocitinib. Study 
(B7451006) supports doses chosen (100 mg and 200 mg) for the pivotal Phase 3 studies. Although the 
data is comprehensive for the intended dose level (100 and 200 mg), no data is available for the 
recommended reduced dose of 50 mg. However, dose reduction to 50 mg is only recommended for 
patients with increased exposure caused either by impairment or co-medication.  
Treatment with abrocitinib should not be initiated in patients with a platelet count < 150 × 103/mm3, 
an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < 0.5 × 103/mm3, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1 × 
103/mm3 or who have a haemoglobin value < 8 g/dL. In addition, treatment should be interrupted if a

patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled. Abrocitinib is contraindicated in 
patients with severe renal impairment.  
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib has been appropriately characterised and relevant dose 
adjustments and precautions are proposed in the SmPC.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
The phase 2b study B7451006 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 
multicentre, dose-ranging, study to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of abrocitinib in participants 
with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of 4 QD dose levels (10, 30, 100, and 
200 mg) of abrocitinib relative to placebo in adult participants with moderate to severe AD with 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) as primary endpoint. The secondary objectives were to 
evaluate the effect of abrocitinib on additional efficacy endpoints and patient reported outcomes 
(PROs) over time. In addition, the safety and tolerability of abrocitinib were evaluated. 
The results with the primary efficacy endpoint showed no statistical difference compared with placebo 
for the two lowest doses 10 mg and 30 mg. Both 100 mg and 200 mg resulted in a statistically 
significant higher proportion of IGA responders at week 12 compared with treatment with placebo, 
21.5 (95% CI 5.5, 37.5) for 100 mg and 38.2 (CI 19.7, 56.6) for 200 mg. The key secondary efficacy 
endpoint was the percent change from baseline in the EASI total score at Week 12. Abrocitinib 
treatment, at both the 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD doses, resulted in a statistically significant higher 
percent change from baseline in EASI score at Week 12 compared to treatment with placebo, -23.82 
(90% CI -38.76, -8.8) for 100 mg and -47.35 (90% CI -62.23, -32.47) for 200 mg.  
To conclude, study B7451006 supports doses chosen for the pivotal Phase 3 studies (see below) where 
results with abrocitinib is further assessed.  
2.6.5.2.  Main studies 
The efficacy of abrocitnib is supported by two pivotal phase 3 studies with identical design (studies 
B7451012 and B7451013). The methods and results of these studies are presented together in this 
report. Moreover, a phase 3 combination study including an active comparator (dupilumab, Dupixent) 
and background topical therapy (study B7451029) has been performed.  
A phase 3 withdrawal and re-treatment study B7451014, and a combination therapy study B7451036 
with background topical therapy in adolescents only have been completed. Study B7451015 is a long-
term recurrence of efficacy and safety study. Study B7451037, a phase 2a study investigating the 
mechanism of action of abrocitinib monotherapy in adult participants, is ongoing.  
This document focuses on the main studies i.e. the monotherapy studies B7451012 and B7451013 and 
the combination therapy study B7451029.

•  Treatments 
Subjects took the investigational product orally once a day for 12 weeks. They took one tablet once 
daily, preferably in the morning, at approximately the same time of the day. 
Since body weight did not appear to be a significant determinant of PK across the weight range 
evaluated in study B7451006, adolescents aged 12 years and older who weighed 40 kg or more were 
administered the same dose as the adults (i.e. 100 mg QD or 200 mg QD). The inclusion of 
adolescents in the clinical trials was agreed to in the CHMP scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SAH/085/2/2017/III) also considered acceptable since the disease panorama of AD is similar 
in adults and adolescents.  
The primary endpoint was evaluated 12 weeks post treatment, with a 4-week follow-up period.  
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of studies B7451012 and B7451013 was to assess the efficacy of abrocitinib 
compared with placebo in subjects aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe AD. Secondary 
objectives were to evaluate the effect of abrocitinib on additional efficacy endpoints and patient 
reported outcomes over time, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of abrocitinib in subjects aged 
12 years and older with moderate to severe AD following 12 weeks of treatment. 
The statistical hypothesis was superiority of abrocitinib 100 mg and 200 mg compared to placebo for 
the primary endpoints. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary efficacy endpoints 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 76/216 
 
 
 
•  Response based on the IGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) (on a 5-point scale) and a 
reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 12. 
•  Response based on EASI 75% or greater improvement from baseline (EASI-75) at Week 12. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  Response based on at least 4 points’ improvement in the severity of pruritus numerical rating 
scale (PP-NRS4) from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 12. 
•  Change from baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (PSAAD) total 
score at Week 12. 
Furthermore, several other secondary efficacy endpoints and Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) 
endpoint were investigated. 
•  Sample size 
The sample size calculation for the two identically designed studies (Study B7451012 and B7451013) 
was based on the co-primary endpoints. With a total of 375 subjects; 150 randomised to each 
abrocitinib arm and 75 randomised to placebo, it was expected to have at least 95% power to detect a 
difference in IGA response rate of at least 20% between abrocitinib 200 mg QD (or 100 mg QD) and 
placebo, assuming a placebo response rate of 6% at Week 12. This sample size was also to provide at 
least 99% power to detect a difference in EASI-75 response rate of at least 30% between abrocitinib 
200 mg QD (or 100 mg QD) and placebo, assuming the placebo response rate to be 15% at Week 12. 
The Type-I error for testing each individual co-primary endpoint was set at 5%. The study was to meet 
its primary objective only if both hypotheses, corresponding to each co-primary endpoint, could be 
rejected and, thereby was the type-I error rate controlled at 5% for testing the primary endpoints. The 
power to reject both hypotheses when a true difference exists was assumed to be at least 94% 
depending on the correlation between the endpoints.  
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Eligible subjects were randomised at Day 1/baseline in a 2:2:1 ratio (abrocitinib 200 mg QD, 
abrocitinib 100 mg QD, or placebo). Randomisation was stratified by baseline disease severity 
(moderate [IGA = 3] vs. severe [IGA = 4] AD), and age (<18 vs. ≥18 years of age). Allocation of 
subjects to treatment groups proceeded through an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system. 
Investigators, subjects and the sponsor study team were blinded to treatment assignment. Abrocitinib 
and matching placebo, were provided as 100 mg tablets in separate bottles. Subjects were dispensed 2 
bottles at each dispensing visit and were instructed to take one tablet from each bottle, once daily.  
•  Statistical methods 
Study B7451012: All analyses were carried out as detailed in the final SAP (Version 4, 23 April 2019) 
but for several exceptions included and justified in the SAP. 
Study B7451013: All analyses were carried out as detailed in the SAP Amendment 1, the final SAP 
(Version 2, dated 26 August 2019). 
There was no interim analysis planned for any of the monotherapy studies and none was performed. 
The primary analysis set was the Full Analysis Set (FAS) defined as all randomised subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Analyses for endpoints that were defined based on a 
threshold of change from baseline (e.g. NRS4) also required the baseline value to meet that threshold 
(e.g. for NRS4, the baseline value needed to be ≥4). 
Analysis of co-primary endpoints 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 77/216 
 
 
 
The co-primary endpoints were analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted by 
randomisation strata (baseline disease severity and age). The proportion of IGA/EASI75 responders in 
abrocitinib treatment groups versus placebo were summarised by the difference and corresponding 
95% CI obtained by normal approximation. The difference in proportions were calculated within each 
randomisation stratum and the final estimate of the difference in proportions was a weighted average 
of these stratum-specific estimates using CMH weights. In case of study withdrawal or use of rescue, a 
subject was counted as non-responder (NR). Estimates of the difference in proportions between the 
two dosing regimens (100 mg and 200 mg) along with the two-sided 95% CI were also provided. No 
hypotheses were tested.  
Sensitivity analyses of IGA/EASI-75 responses at Week 12 were performed using the CMH and normal 
approximation method, where missing responses were multiply imputed using a tipping point (TP) 
approach, which considered analyses under missing at random (MAR), as well as missing not at 
random (MNAR). 
Table 13 Summary of the analyses of primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints 
Response based on a ≥4-points improvement from baseline in pruritus NRS score for severity 
Missing data imputation: Due to a technical error in the transmission and collection of electronic data, 
data on the pruritus NRS scale was not collected from several subjects at scheduled visits of Week 2 
(Day 15) and after. This was foremost evident in study B7451012 but occurred also in study 
B7451013. To account for missing responses in the analyses (weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), a hybrid 
approach (NR+MI) was used. The multiple imputation methodology was based on an assumption of 
missing at random (MAR). In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed where all missing 
responses were defined as “non-response”. 
Change from baseline (CFB) in PSAAD score at Week 12 
The PSAAD total score was calculated as the simple arithmetic mean of items 1-11. Change from 
baseline in the PSAAD score at week 12 was analysed using a mixed-effect, repeated measures 
(MMRM) model. The fixed effects of treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and randomisation 
stratification factors were included. Visit was modelled as a categorical covariate. Unstructured 
covariance matrix was assumed for the model errors. Compound symmetry covariance matrix was

   Page 78/216 
 
 
 
 
used if this model did not converge. Data was collected daily and were summarised using a simple 
average of the values recorded within a week. In the implementation of the MMRM models, data from 
all weekly visits were used. The preliminary PSAAD version is a 15-item questionnaire; four additional 
items (Items 12, 13, 14, and 15) were added for exploratory and psychometric validation purposes 
(Sleep & Usual Activities Questions and Patient Global Impression of Severity [PGIS] & Patient Global 
Impression of Change Questions [PGIC]).  
Multiple testing procedure 
To control the familywise Type 1 error at 5%, a sequential Bonferroni-based iterative multiple testing 
procedure was used for testing each of the two abrocitinib doses versus placebo on the primary and 
key secondary endpoints. See Figure 11.

occurred most frequently. Other reasons were related to errors with laboratory results, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, took prohibited concomitant medication, and dosing/administration errors 
of investigational product/study medication. 
Treatment compliance was high, the mean dose compliance was 98%, 99% and 97% in the abrocitinib 
200mg QD, abrocitinib 100mg QD, and placebo groups, respectively. 
Study B7451013  
For efficacy analyses of co-primary and key secondary endpoints, subjects who had major protocol 
deviations were excluded from the PPAS. 
Important protocol deviations were reported in 86% of subjects, most frequently in the category of 
procedures or tests, of which a missing NRS assessment occurred most frequently. Other reasons were 
related to errors with laboratory results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, took prohibited concomitant 
medication, and dosing/administration errors of investigational product/study medication. 
Treatment compliance was high, the mean (SD%) dose compliance was 97% across treatment groups.

The key secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Response based on ≥4 points improvement from baseline in the peak pruritus NRS (PP-NRS4) 
for severity at Weeks 2, 4, and 12. Pruritis is viewed as an important symptom of the disease 
and NRS-4 is viewed as a clinically meaningful response.   
•  Change from baseline in PSAAD at Week 12.

Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. Baseline was defined as the 
last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1).  
Each complete imputed data set was analyzed using the CMH risk difference method adjusting by randomisation strata, separately for each 
week. Results from multiply imputed data sets were combined using Rubin's rules to obtain treatment difference, 95% CI and p-value. Missing 
responses after permanent discontinuation were defined as non-responders. Any intermittent missing responses were imputed 500 times using 
random Bernoulli draws using a posterior probability of response at each visit. Posterior probabilities were estimated under a Bayesian 
framework from a logit-normal GLMM with treatment,  
visit, treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects and a latent subject-level, zero mean, normally distributed random effect, with a logit link 
function.  
At Week 2, there was no subject with intermittent missing data so no multiple imputations were performed.  
CMH = Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel; N = Number of subjects available in the analysis set with baseline >= 4; NRI = Non-Responder Imputation; 
MI = Multiple Imputation; GLMM = Generalised Linear Mixed Model.

Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. Baseline was defined as the 
measurement collected on or prior to Day 1.  
If a subject withdrew from the study, then this subject was counted as non-responder after withdrawal. Any other intermittent missing value was 
handled using multiple imputation.  
CI = confidence interval; CMH = Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel; GLMM = generalised linear mixed model; MI = multiple imputation; N = number 
of subjects in the analysis set with NRI + MI at the  
specified visit with baseline >= 4; NRI = non-responder imputation.  
At Week 2, no multiple imputations were performed because there were <= 5 subjects with missing responses in all treatment groups.

B7451029: A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group, multi-centre study investigating the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib and dupilumab 
in comparison with placebo in adult subjects on background topical therapy, with moderate 
to severe atopic dermatitis. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Main inclusion criteria 
1.  Male or female subjects aged 18 years or older at the time of informed consent. 
2.  Met all the following AD criteria: 
•  Clinical diagnosis of chronic AD (also known as atopic eczema) for at least 1 year prior to Day 
1 and had confirmed AD at the screening and baseline visits according to Hanifin and Rajka 
criteria for AD. 
•  Documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of inadequate response 
to treatment with medicated topical therapy for AD for at least 4 weeks, or who had required 
systemic therapies for control of their disease. 
•  Moderate to severe AD (affected BSA ≥10%, IGA≥3, EASI≥16, and Pruritus NRS severity 
score≥4 on the day of the baseline visit). 
3.  During the last 7 days prior to Day 1, for the treatment of AD, the subject must have used only 
non-medicated topical therapy (i.e., emollient) without other active ingredients indicated to 
treat AD, or other additives which could affect AD (e.g., hyaluronic acid, urea, ceramide or 
filaggrin degradation products) at least twice daily, with response to treatment remaining 
inadequate at baseline. The subject also was willing and able to comply with standardised 
background topical therapy, as per protocol guidelines throughout the remainder of the study. 
4.  Must have agreed to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and not to use tanning booths, sun 
lamps or other ultraviolet light sources during the study. 
5.  If receiving concomitant medications for any reason other than AD, must have been on a 
stable regimen, defined as not starting a new drug or changing dosage within 7 days or 5 half-
lives (whichever was longer) prior to Day 1 and through the duration of the study. 
Main exclusion criteria 
1.  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) 
or active suicidal ideation or behaviour or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk 
associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere 
with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make 
the subject inappropriate for entry into this study. 
2.  Any psychiatric condition including recent or active suicidal ideation or behaviour that met any 
of the following criteria: 
•  
Suicidal ideation associated with actual intent and a method or plan in the past year: 
“Yes” answers on items 4 or 5 of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS); 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 90/216 
 
 
 
 
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Previous history of suicidal behaviours in the past 5years: “Yes” answer (for events 
that occurred in the past 5 years) to any of the suicidal behaviour items of the C-
SSRS; 
Any lifetime history of serious or recurrent suicidal behaviour; 
Clinically significant depression: Patient Health Questionnaire –8 items (PHQ-8) total 
score ≥15; 
The presence of any current major psychiatric disorder that was not explicitly 
permitted in the inclusion/exclusion criteria; 
In the opinion of the investigator or Pfizer (or designee) exclusion was required. 
3.  A current or past medical history of conditions associated with thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy 
or platelet dysfunction. 
4.  Receiving anti-coagulants or medications known to cause thrombocytopenia, (unless 
considered safe to stop and washout for the duration of the study). 
5.  Had active forms of other inflammatory skin diseases, i.e., not AD or had evidence of skin 
conditions (e.g., psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, Lupus) at the time of Day 1 that would 
interfere with evaluation of AD or response to treatment. 
6.  Vaccinated or exposed to a live or attenuated vaccine within the 6 weeks prior to the first dose 
of investigational product or was expected to be vaccinated or to have household exposure to 
these vaccines during treatment or during the 6 weeks following discontinuation of 
investigational product. 
7.  Subjects who had received prior treatment with any systemic JAK inhibitors. Prior treatment 
with topical JAK inhibitors was not exclusionary.  
8.  Previous treatment with dupilumab and/or a history of hypersensitivity, intolerance, AE, or 
allergic reaction associated with prior exposure to dupilumab’s excipients. 
Treatments 
The study design of the study B7451029 involved two doses of abrocitinib 100 mg and 200 mg dosed 
similarly as in the monotherapy studies B7451012 and B7451013. Moreover, one group received 
dupilumab dosed according to approved product information, and two placebo groups that received 
both a placebo injection and oral placebo. The two abrocitinib groups received placebo injections, and 
the dupilumab group got oral placebo.  
Topical Corticosteroids (TCS) should be applied once daily to areas with active lesions, starting on 
baseline and throughout the study. 
The treatment duration was 20 weeks. The primary efficacy assessment took place at week 12, and 
key secondary efficacy assessments at week 2 and week 16. At week 20, eligible subjects entered the 
B7451015 long-term extension study. Efficacy and safety endpoints were assessed throughout the 
entire study. 
The study estimated the relative efficacy of both doses of abrocitinib and of dupilumab. The 
comparison of abrocitinib with dulilumab was based on their ability to reduce itch, measured by the 
severity of PNRS-4 from baseline at week 2. Moreover, the efficacy of abrocitnib combined with 
background topical treatment with moisturizer and medicated topical treatment was assessed.  
Objectives 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 91/216 
 
 
 
 
The primary objective of study B7451029 was to assess the efficacy of 100mg and 200mg once daily 
(QD) of abrocitinib versus placebo in adult subjects on background topical therapy with moderate to 
severe AD.  
Secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of abrocitinib versus dupilumab in terms of attaining a clinically 
significant improvement in the severity of pruritus for adult subjects on background topical 
therapy with moderate to severe AD. 
To estimate the difference in efficacy measures between two doses of abrocitinib and 
dupilumab for adult subjects on background topical therapy with moderate to severe AD. 
To estimate the effect of abrocitinib on additional efficacy endpoints and patient-reported 
outcomes over time in adult subjects on background topical therapy with moderate to severe 
AD. 
To compare the safety and tolerability of 100 mg and 200mg QD of abrocitinib and dupilumab 
versus placebo in adult subjects on background topical therapy with moderate to severe AD. 
To estimate the safety and tolerability of the two doses of abrocitinib versus dupilumab, for 
adult subjects on background topical therapy with moderate to severe AD.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Response based on achieving the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of clear (0) or almost 
clear (1) (on a 5-point scale) and a reduction from baseline (pre-dose Day1) of ≥2 points at week 
12. 
•  Response based on achieving the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 (≥75% improvement 
from baseline) at week 12. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Response based on achieving at least 4 points improvement in the severity of Pruritus Numerical 
Rating Scale (NRS) from baseline at week 2.  
•  Response based on achieving the IGA of clear (0) or almost clear (1) (on a 5-point scale) and a 
reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at week 16.  
•  Response based on achieving EASI-75 (≥75% improvement from baseline) at week 16. 
Furthermore, several other secondary efficacy endpoints and Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) 
endpoint were investigated. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking)  
Eligible subjects were randomised at baseline/Day 1 in a 4:4:4:1:1 ratio to 100 mg or 200 mg of 
abrocitinib, dupilumab, or one of two sequences of placebo for 16 weeks followed by either 100 mg or 
200 mg of abrocitinib QD. For the purpose of the primary (final, week 16) analysis the two placebo 
sequences were combined. Treatment assignment was through a computer-generated randomisation 
schedule and Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomisation was administered using centre-
based randomly permuted blocks with the centre-based randomisation chosen due to drug 
management considerations. This was a double-blind study with investigators, subjects, and the 
sponsor study team blinded as to treatment group. Using double-dummy technique, subjects were to 
receive both injectable and oral investigational product. Dupilumab, 300 mg/2mL and dupilumab 
placebo were provided as prefilled syringes for subcutaneous injection. Due to viscosity differences 
between dupilumab and the matched placebo, the administrator/trainer was to be treated as if unblind 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 92/216 
 
 
 
and was kept from all other study activities. Blinded abrocitinib, 100 mg tablets, and its matched 
placebo tablets were provided in separate bottles. Subjects were dispensed two bottles of tablets and 
were to be given clear dosing instructions to take one tablet from each bottle, once daily. 
Statistical methods 
The final analysis for the co-primary and key secondary endpoints was performed after the last subject 
in the study had had the opportunity to complete the week 16 visit. At the time of week 16 analysis, 
access to the database containing individual treatment group assignments was to be restricted to the 
sponsor study team. Treatment duration was to be 20 weeks with the blinding hence maintained 
throughout; an end of study analysis was to be reported in a supplemental CSR. The study B7451029 
CSR presents the results of the 16-week efficacy and safety data that include all primary and 
secondary efficacy analyses based on database release on 05 February 2020. The corresponding SAP 
(version) was dated 23 January 2020. No formal interim analysis was planned or has been performed.  
The primary analysis population for efficacy data was the Full Analysis Set (FAS) defined as all 
randomised subjects who received at least one dose of investigational product.  
Analysis of primary endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints were analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted by baseline 
disease severity group (moderate and severe). The difference between each active group and the 
placebo group in the proportion of subjects achieving IGA response (similarly for EASI-75) along with 
its 95% confidence interval (using the normal approximation for the difference in binomial proportions) 
were reported. If a subject withdrew from the study, then this subject was counted as non-responder 
for endpoints after withdrawal. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoints were analysed using the same method as for the co-primary endpoints 
which also applied to any other binary endpoint. 
For continuous endpoints, a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) was used. The MMRM 
model included factors (fixed effects) for treatment group, disease severity group, visit, treatment-by-
visit interaction, and relevant baseline value. Within the MMRM framework, the treatment difference 
was tested at the pre-specified primary time point, week 12, as well as at the other time points by 
time point-specific contrasts from the MMRM model. An unstructured covariance matrix was assumed 
for the model errors. Compound symmetry covariance matrix was to be used if the model with 
unstructured covariance did not converge. At each visit, estimates of least square mean (LSM) values 
and the LSM differences between treatment groups were derived from the model as was corresponding 
p-values and 95% confidence intervals. In the model all patients with baseline data were used for 
estimating baseline covariate effects and adjusting LS means. 
Multiple testing procedure 
To control the familywise Type 1 error at 5%, a sequential Bonferroni-based iterative multiple testing 
procedure was used for assessing each of the two abrocitinib doses versus placebo on the two primary 
and the three key secondary endpoints, see Figure 14 below.

Figure 14 Schematic for Multiple Testing Procedure 
In order to be more rigorous regarding onset of relief of severity of pruritus, a step-down approach 
with the NRS4 endpoint from Week 2 to earlier time points was utilised as an additional family of 
hypothesis tests once statistical significance had been demonstrated at week 2 (rejection of each 
hypothesis of no difference in NRS4 at week 2 within Sequence A).  Further hypotheses of no 
difference in NRS4 was then to be assessed along four sequences (abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg 
versus placebo and dupilumab, respectively). All hypotheses were to be assessed at a 5% significance 
level and concerned comparisons at Day 15, Day 14, Day, 13, Day 12, …, Day 2, in that order.

Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication.  
Baseline was defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1).  
If a subject withdrew from the study, then this subject was counted as non-responder after withdrawal.  
CI = confidence interval; CMH = Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel; N = number of subjects in the analysis set with NRI at the specified visit; n (%) = 
number of subjects with response(percentage based on N); NRI = non-responder imputation; NRS = numeric rating scale.  
[1] The estimate and confidence interval (CI) for difference were calculated based on the weighted average of difference by disease severity 
group using the normal approximation of binomial proportions. CI for the response rate was based on normal approximation (or the Clopper-
Pearson exact method when there were 0 or 100% responders).  
[2] P-value was calculated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method adjusted by baseline disease severity.  
Peak pruritus NRS4 response at week 12 and week 16 are also presented below.

Clinical biomarkers 
Treatment with abrocitinib was associated with dose-dependent reduction in serum biomarkers of 
inflammation in atopic dermatitis [interleukin-31 (IL-31), interleukin-22 (IL-22), eosinophil count, and 
thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)], JAK1 signalling [natural killer (NK) cell count and 
interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10)] or both [high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)]. 
These changes were reversible after treatment discontinuation. 
Mean absolute lymphocyte count increased by 2 weeks after starting treatment with abrocitinib and 
returned to baseline by Month 9 of treatment. Most patients maintained an ALC within the reference 
range. Treatment with abrocitinib was associated with a dose-related increase in B cell counts and a 
dose-related decrease in NK cell counts. The clinical significance of these changes in B cell and NK cell 
counts is unknown. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses by intrinsic factors (age, sex, race ethnicity, weight and body mass index, disease 
severity by IGA and EASI, percent BSA affected by AD, and comorbidities) and extrinsic factors 
(geographic region and prior therapy for AD) were performed for the monotherapy studies (B7451012 
and B7451013) and the combination therapy study B7451029.  
The IGA response, and the EASI-75 response by subgroups is shown for studies B7451012, B7451013 
and B7451029.

Notes 
The co-primary endpoints were analysed using non-responder imputation (NRI).  If a 
subject withdrew from the study, this subject was counted as a non-responder after 
withdrawal. 
The number and percent, n (%), of subjects who discontinued from the study were as 
follows:  
- PBO, a total of 16 (20.8%) discontinued (7 [9.1%] due to Adverse Events, 2 [2.6%] 
due to Lack of Efficacy) 
- ABR 100, a total of 21 (13.5%) discontinued (9 [5.8%] due to Adverse Events, 1 
[0.6%] due to Lack of Efficacy) 
- ABR 200, a total of 17 (11.0%) discontinued (9 [5.8%] due to Adverse Events, 0 due to 
Lack of Efficacy)

Notes 
The co-primary endpoints were analysed using non-response imputation (NRI).  If a 
subject withdrew from the study, then this subject was counted as non-responder after 
withdrawal. 
The number and percent, n (%), of subjects who discontinued from the study were as 
follows:  
- PBO, a total of 26 (33.3%) discontinued (8 [10.3%] due to Adverse Events, 7 [9.0%] 
due to Lack of Efficacy) 
- ABR 100, a total of 21 (13.3%) discontinued (5 [3.2%] due to Adverse Events, 5 
[3.2%] due to Lack of Efficacy) 
- ABR 200, a total of 14 (9.0%) discontinued (5 [3.2%] due to Adverse Events, 4 [2.6%] 
due to Lack of Efficacy])

2.6.5.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A comparison of efficacy results across all pivotal studies (B7451012, B7451013 and B7451029) was 
made. In each individual phase 3 monotherapy or combination therapy studies, both doses of 
abrocitinib met each of the co-primary endpoints. Abrocitinib 200 mg QD consistently had a higher 
magnitude of effect than 100 mg QD. The differences from placebo were statistically significant and are 
assessed as clinically relevant.  
The key secondary endpoints which evaluated itch supported the results obtained with the co-primary 
endpoints. The time-course of IGA, EASI-75 and PP-NRS4 responses of monotherapy and combination 
therapy showed that the effect on itch (PP-NRS4) is observed sooner than the effect on overall AD 
symptoms detected by IGA-75 and EASI.  
2.6.5.5.  Supportive studies 
B7451014: A Phase 3 randomized withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-
centre study investigating the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib in subjects aged 12 years 
and over, with moderate to severe aAD with the option of rescue treatment in flaring 
subjects 
Study B7451014 was designed to evaluate and compare the maintenance of effect of two doses of 
abrocitinib and placebo in subjects aged 12 and above with moderate to severe AD who respond to an 
initial open-label run-in treatment of 200 mg abrocitinib QD. 
This was a randomised-withdrawal, responder-enriched, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib monotherapy in subjects aged 12 years and 
older with moderate-to-severe AD. The study consisted of an open-label induction treatment period 
with abrocitinib 200 mg QD for 12 weeks, from which responders were randomised after 12 weeks in a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive abrocitinib 200 mg QD, abrocitinib 100 mg QD, or matching placebo in a double-
blinded maintenance treatment period for 40 weeks. Subjects who met the protocol definition of flare 
during blinded treatment entered an open-label rescue treatment with abrocitinib 200 mg QD plus 
topicals for 12 weeks. During the open-label 12-week run-in period of the study, all subjects received 
abrocitinib 200 mg QD as monotherapy. 
Main Inclusion Criteria 
Adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe AD defined by the 
following at baseline: Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) ≥3; Eczema Area and Severity Index 
(EASI) ≥16; pruritus severity score on the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) ≥4; Body

Surface Area (BSA) of involvement ≥10%. Subjects needed to have had a documented history of 
recent inadequate response to treatment with topical AD medications or had required systemic 
therapies for control of their disease. 
Randomisation Criteria 
Subjects who responded to induction treatment with abrocitinib 200 mg QD, defined as a) achieving an 
IGA of clear (0) or almost clear (1) (on a 5 point scale), b) a reduction from IGA baseline of ≥2 points, 
and c) obtaining a 75% reduction from their EASI from baseline (EASI-75) were randomised.  
Primary Endpoint 
• 
Loss of response or flare requiring rescue defined as a loss of at least 50% of the EASI 
response at Week 12 and an IGA score of 2 or higher. 
Efficacy Results 
12-week open-label run-in period 
•  At Week 12 of abrocitinib 200 mg QD treatment during the open label run-in period, 64.3% of 
subjects achieved IGA response, 74.4% of subjects achieved EASI-75, and 67.3% of subjects 
achieved PP-NRS4. 
Disposition 
•  A total of 1233 subjects were treated in the run-in phase. Among these subjects, 798 subjects 
(64.7%) met responder criteria and were randomised to placebo (267 subjects), abrocitinib 
100 mg QD (265 subjects), or abrocitinib 200 mg QD (266 subjects). Demographic and 
baseline disease characteristics were similar among randomised treatment arms. 
•  A slightly higher proportion of 200 mg subjects (13.2%) compared to 100 mg QD (8.3%) or 
placebo (6.0%) discontinued study during the randomised period. This was related to the lower 
proportion of subjects who experienced flares during the randomised period in the 200 mg arm 
compared to other arms. 
Prevention of flares 
•  During the 40-week blinded, randomised treatment period, subjects in the placebo arm had a 
significantly higher probability of flaring compared to either dose of abrocitinib (p<0.0001 for 
both doses relative to placebo). Relative to the 100 mg QD group, the 200 mg QD group 
showed a significantly lower probability of flaring (p<0.0001) (Figure 21).  
• 
• 
The probability of not flaring (i.e., not experiencing protocol-defined flares) by week 52 was 
19.1% for placebo, 57.4% for abrocitinib 100 mg, and 81.1% for abrocitinib 200 mg.   
The median time to flare was 28 days for the placebo group. In contrast, for both abrocitinib 
100 mg QD and 200 mg QD groups, median time to flare could not be estimated as too few 
events were observed by week 40 of randomised treatment.

Rescue treatment 
•  A total of 351 patients received developed protocol-defined flares and received rescue 
treatment of 200 mg QD abrocitinib. These included 76.4% of the placebo group (204 
subjects), 39.2% of the abrocitinib 100 mg QD group (104 subjects), and 16.2% of the 
abrocitinib 200 QD mg group (43 subjects). 
•  Subjects responded to rescue treatment regardless of the treatment group. Overall, subjects 
who received rescue treatment achieved IGA clear or almost clear in 69.3% of subjects, and 
EASI-75 (relative to their rescue baseline) in 82.2% of subjects at rescue Week 12 (Table 36). 
The rate of recapture of response was highest for patients who were randomised to placebo 
and lowest for the patients who were randomised to abrocitinib 200 mg in the randomised 
withdrawal period of Study B7451014.

Conclusions 
• 
The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints. A significantly higher proportion of 
subjects were able to avoid protocol-defined flare on both active regimens relative to complete 
withdrawal (placebo), with a significantly higher proportion of subjects being able to do so 
while continuing 200 mg compared to a step-down to 100 mg.   
•  Despite this, the median time to flare in 100 mg QD of exceeding 40 weeks and the lower 
incidence of adverse events with 100 mg QD makes induction-maintenance (with a step-down 
in dose from induction to maintenance) a clinically viable strategy.  
• 
• 
The efficacy of abrocitinib in preventing AD flare relative to placebo during the 40-week 
randomised treatment period is consistent with the high degree of efficacy and dose-response 
demonstrated in the pivotal studies B7451012, B7451013, and B7450129. 
The majority of subjects who experienced flares achieved IGA response after receiving 12 
weeks of rescue treatment. 
B7451015: a phase 3 multi centre, long term extension study investigating the efficacy and 
safety of abrocitinib, with or without topical medications, administered to subjects aged 12 
years and older with moderate to severe AD. 
Study B7451015 was designed to estimate the long-term efficacy and safety of 100 mg and 200 mg 
QD abrocitinib with or without topical treatments in adult and adolescent subjects who previously 
participated in qualifying abrocitinib AD trials. 
This is an ongoing, multi-centre, long-term extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of abrocitinib administered to subjects aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe AD. 
The initial submission was based on a data cutoff date of 22 April 2020. To support the CHMP request 
for updated data from study B7451015, data cut was performed for efficacy with a cut-off date of 08 
January 2021. A summary of the updated efficacy data is provided below.    
Subjects must have completed a qualifying phase 3 study or have completed the open-label run-in 
period of study B7451014 and failed to meet the protocol defined response criteria at week 12. Study 
B7451015 enabled subjects to continue dosing at the same abrocitinib dose they were randomised to 
in the qualifying parent study or continue abrocitinib 200 mg QD if entering directly from the open-
label run-in period of B7451014. If randomised to placebo or active comparator in the qualifying study, 
the subject was to be randomised to abrocitinib 100 mg QD or 200 mg QD upon entry into study 
B7451015. Following a 92-week Treatment Period 1, subjects remaining eligible are to progress to a 
variable-length open-label Treatment Period 2, in which subjects are to receive abrocitinib at the same 
dose as they received in Treatment Period 1 until commercial product is available in their country, until 
the applicant ends the study in that country, or until the subject requires discontinuation from the 
study. 
Primary objective 
To evaluate the long-term safety of abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD with or without topical 
treatments in adult and adolescent subjects who previously participated in abrocitinib AD phase 3 
studies.

Subjects previously randomised to abrocitinib 200 mg QD or 100 mg QD in the qualifying parent study 
were allocated to the same dose, and the blind was maintained throughout Treatment Period 1. In 
accordance with process specified in the protocol, once a qualifying study was completed, the 
treatment assignment for those subjects became known to the applicant study team and investigative 
site staff. With the exception of subjects entering from the open-label run-in period of study 
B7451014, subjects remained blinded to treatment group during the 92-week Treatment Period 1 of 
study B7451015. Blinding of the applicant study team, investigative site staff, and subjects remained 
intact for the interim analyses performed for the initial and updated submissions. 
Data Pooling 
To evaluate the efficacy of both doses of abrocitinib as up to 48 weeks of cumulative treatment, data 
were pooled from subjects who initially participated in study B7451012, B7451013, or B7451029 and 
subsequently entered the Phase 3 long-term extension study B7451015. In study B7451015, subjects 
continued the same dose of abrocitinib that they received in their qualifying parent study, except for 
those originally allocated to placebo or active comparator, who were re-randomised to abrocitinib 100 
mg QD or 200 mg QD. This strategy allows appropriate evaluation and comparison of the 2 doses of 
abrocitinib, with or without topical therapy.   
For the initial submission and this updated submission, efficacy data from the integrated long-term 
therapy pool were/are presented instead of study B7451015 as a stand-alone study. Efficacy data from 
the long-term therapy pool include data from both the qualifying phase 3 studies B7451012, 
B7451013, and B7451029 and the long-term extension study B7451015, and thus provide more 
meaningful analyses of efficacy over time. 
Analytical Methods 
The analytical methods for the efficacy evaluations included in this update are the same as those 
described for the initial submission. In both the initial submission and this updated submission, 
analyses of efficacy data from the integrated long-term therapy pool were/are based on as-observed 
data (i.e., only subjects with available data at a given time-point were included in the analysis). 
Results 
The long-term efficacy data is presented for the overall population, initial responders, and initial non-
responders, because evaluation of maintenance of response in responders is not the only clinically 
relevant way to assess durability of response to a treatment. Maintenance of response only addresses 
the clinical question of a patient who has responded to initial treatment, continues that response long-
term and does not account for early partial responders or non-responders who later become full 
responders with continued treatment (Bartos et al, 2016). A significant proportion of patients receiving 
long-term abrocitinib have demonstrated late-onset response. In addition, patients who are choosing 
to start a treatment may have a different clinical question - what are their chances of having a good 
response on long-term treatment.   
The overall population of the updated long-term therapy pool includes 1116 subjects: 595 subjects 
who received abrocitinib 100 mg QD continuously and 521 subjects who received abrocitinib 200 mg 
QD continuously (same as the original submission).  
The response rates at Week 48 of cumulative abrocitinib treatment remained similar to or higher than 
those at week 12 for either dose of abrocitinib, thus demonstrating long-term efficacy (Figure 23). The 
response rates of 200 mg QD at week 48 were higher than those of 100 mg QD, indicating dose 
dependency of long-term efficacy. 
At week 48, the updated response rates for abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD in the overall 
population were:

Among responders to abrocitinib at Week 12, the majority of subjects maintained their response at 
Week 48 of cumulative abrocitinib treatment for both doses of abrocitinib, indicating durability of 
efficacy. The proportions of subjects with response at Week 48 were as follows: 
- 
IGA response, responder proportion (95% CI): 
o  100 mg QD – 59.8% (49.1, 70.4)

o  200 mg QD – 82.9% (76.6, 89.1) 
Among the Week 12 IGA non-responders, continuation of abrocitinib for an additional 12 weeks 
(through Week 24) resulted in IGA response rates of 24.7% and 28.5% with 100 mg QD and 200 mg 
QD, respectively. Among the Week 12 EASI-75 non-responders, the late-response rates were even 
higher, with 50.0% and 57.8% of the subjects continuing with abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD, 
respectively, achieving EASI-75 at Week 24. 
Subjects who were partial responders (IGA=2, mild disease) at Week 12 had Week 24 IGA response 
rates of 39.8% and 35.5% for 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD, respectively, indicating a better response 
compared to initial non-responder. 
Patients who received dupilumab in the COMPARE study and subsequently entered EXTEND were 
randomised to either 100 mg or 200 mg of abrocitinib once daily upon entering EXTEND. Among non-
responders to dupilumab, a substantial proportion of patients achieved response 12 weeks after 
switching to abrocitinib [34% and 47% for IGA (0 or 1) response, and 68% and 80% for EASI-75 with 
100 mg once daily or 200 mg once daily, respectively]. 
The numerical data presented in the SmPC for long-term efficacy are based on the data included in the 
initial submission. The applicant committed to submitting a post approval type II variation to further 
update SmPC section 5.1 by 31 December 2022. 
B7451036: a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study 
investigating the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib coadministered with background 
medicated topical therapy in adolescent subjects 12 to <18 years of age with moderate-to-
severe AD. 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of abrocitinib in adolescent participants 12 to <18 years of age with moderate-to-
severe AD. A total of 287 participants were randomised globally in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive abrocitinib 
QD at 200 mg, 100 mg, or placebo for 12 weeks. All subjects were required to receive background 
medicated topical therapy. 
Main inclusion criteria 
Adolescent subjects 12 to <18 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD defined by the following at 
baseline: Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) ≥3; Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥16; 
pruritus severity score on the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) ≥4; Body Surface Area 
(BSA) of involvement ≥10%. Subjects needed to have had a documented history of recent inadequate 
response to treatment with topical AD medications or had received systemic therapies for AD or were 
candidates for systemic therapies for AD. 
Co-primary endpoints 
• 
• 
IGA response: Response based on the IGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1); and a 
reduction from baseline of 2 points at week 12.  
EASI-75 response: Response based on the EASI 75% improvement from baseline (EASI-75) at 
week 12. 
Efficacy Results 
A total of 287 subjects were randomised. The discontinuation rate was 3.2-6.3% across treatment 
arm.  Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced among treatment groups; 49.1% were 
female, 56.1% were Caucasian, 33.0% were Asian and 6.0% were Black patients. The median age was 
15 years and the proportion of patients with severe atopic dermatitis (IGA of 4) was 38.6%.

Significantly higher proportion of subjects achieved IGA response at week 12 for abrocitinib 100 mg 
QD (p=0.0147) and 200 mg QD (p=0.0030) compared with placebo (Figure 24 and table 40).  
Similarly, significantly higher proportion of subjects achieved EASI-75 at week 12 for abrocitinib 
100 mg QD (p=0.0002) and 200 mg QD (p<0.0001) compared with placebo. Significantly higher 
proportion of subjects achieved PP-NRS4 response at week 12 for both doses of abrocitinib compared

demonstrating that both abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD arms were superior to placebo when 
administered in combination with medicated topical therapy in adolescents.   
These results are consistent with the efficacy results of the pivotal monotherapy studies B7451012 and 
B7451013 (in adults and adolescents), and the combination therapy study B7451029 (in adults).  
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application for abrocitinib is supported by two Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group studies with identical design; study B7451012 and study B7451013. 
Furthermore, a Phase 3, multi-centre active control study on background topical therapy study 
B7451029 has been performed. 
The studies included men and women with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Studies 
B7451012 and B7451013 also included adolescents (≥12 years of age), while study B7451029 was 
performed in adults only. The study participants were aged 12 to 84 and 12 to 83 years in studies 
B7451012 and B7451013, respectively, 18 to 84 years in study B7451029. In studies B7451012 and 
B7451013, the subjects should have a clinical diagnosis of chronic AD with inadequate response to 
treatment with topical medication. The AD should be of moderate to severe degree (affected BSA 
≥10%, IGA≥3, EASI≥16, and Pruritus NRS≥4 at the baseline visit). The inclusion criteria of study 
B7451029 were overall similar with studies B7451012 and B7451013. The inclusion criteria are 
considered adequate to reflect the proposed therapeutic indication. 
The exclusion criteria for studies B7451012, B7451013 and B7451029 reflected general warnings for 
use for JAK inhibitors, e.g. with respect to infection, haematological abnormalities, viral reactivation 
and the risks for venous thromboembolism. These exclusion criteria are all considered relevant. 
Subjects with recent or active suicidal ideation intent or behavior was excluded from the pivotal study 
protocols. However, several subjects (12.6%) participating in the pivotal studies B7451012, 
B7451013, and B7451029 had a medical history of psychiatric disorders related to depression, anxiety, 
or suicidal ideation.

Eligible subjects were treated with 100 mg or 200 mg abrocitinib mg or placebo for 12 weeks in studies 
B7451012 and B7451013, and for 20 weeks in study B7451029. The treatment was to be taken once 
daily, preferably in the morning, at approximately the same time of the day. The proposed dosing in 
the SmPC section 4.2 has been updated stating that for most patients 200 mg is the recommended 
starting dose. The general dosing recommendation is accepted by CHMP. 
Furthermore, the applicant intends to market a 50mg tablet strength (for patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment and for patients receiving strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
2C19) and has included recommendations for the 50mg dose in the SmPC. As the 50mg tablet/dose 
was never used in clinical trials, it needed to be ensured that the provided model supported a full 
extrapolation of efficacy and safety from populations studied in the Phase 3 studies to these special 
populations with eGFR < 40 mL/min. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant provided an updated 
popPK model (PMAR-1110) including the parent compound and the active metabolites and performed 
an additional analysis to evaluate the change in exposure based on renal impairment compared to 
normal AD patients. The analysis indicated that comparable exposure can be achieved in patients with 
moderate renal impairment with a lower dose. For patients with severe renal impairment (<30mL/min) 
50mg is determined as the proposed starting dose (an up-titration to 100mg is possible) based on data 
extrapolation. 
In study B7451029, dupilumab (Dupixent) was used as active comparator. Blinded dupilumab, 300 
mg/ml, and its matching placebo were dosed according to the approved product information. At the 
time when the clinical programme of abrocitinib was designed and implemented, dupilumab was the 
only marketed product indicated for moderate to severe AD. The choice of comparator is therefore 
considered appropriate and of relevance in view of the EU approved treatment options. Recently, the 
JAK-inhibitors baricitinib (Olumiant) and upadacitinib (Rinvoq) received positive opinions for a new 
indication, treatment of moderate to severe AD (in adults only for Olumiant and in adults and in 
adolescents for Rinvoq). A comparison between abrocitinib and baricitinib or upadacitinib would have 
been of interest but was not optional at time of designing or submitting the present application. 
Tralokinumab (Adtralza) was also recently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in 
adults.  
In the combination therapy study B7451029, topical corticosteroids (TCS) were to be applied once 
daily to areas with active lesions, starting on Day 1 (baseline) and throughout the study according to a 
guidance. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) or a PDE4 inhibitor (e.g., 
crisaborole) could be used instead of corticosteroids in body areas of thin skin (face, neck, 
intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atrophy, etc.) with active lesions or if continued 
treatment with TCS of any potency is not tolerated. In the CHMP scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SAH/085/2/2017/III) it was stated that efficacy needed to be established also when 
combined with medicated topical therapy and was considered important since topical medicated 
therapy is the basis of AD treatment.  
Subject e-diaries were given to the participating subjects and scores were collected at different 
intervals for the key secondary endpoints. 
Treatment compliance was assessed using data from the subject diary across the entire study. 
Treatment compliance was verified through a combination of unused investigational product returned 
by the subject at the study visits, review of the dosing diary, and discussion with the subject.  
The primary objective of studies B7451012 and B7451013 was to assess the efficacy of abrocitinib 
100mg and 200mg once daily compared with placebo in subjects aged 12 years and older with 
moderate to severe AD. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of abrocitinib on additional 
efficacy endpoints and patient reported outcomes over time, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability

of abrocitinib in subjects aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe AD following 12 weeks of 
treatment. 
The primary objective of study B7451029 was to assess the efficacy of 100 mg and 200 mg once daily 
of abrocitinib versus placebo in adult subjects on background topical therapy with moderate to severe 
AD. Secondary objectives of were to evaluate the efficacy of abrocitinib versus dupilumab on pruritus 
and other efficacy measures among others. 
The corresponding co-primary efficacy variables in all pivotal clinical trials were the response based on 
the IGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) (on a 5-point scale) and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 
points at week 12., and the response based on EASI 75% or greater improvement from baseline 
(EASI-75) at week 12. These efficacy variables are well established, have been used in several AD 
studies over time and are considered to be of clinical relevance if met.  
The key secondary endpoints in studies B7451012 and B7451013 were the response based on at least 
4-points improvement in the severity of pruritus numerical rating scale (PP-NRS4) from baseline at 
weeks 2, 4, and 12, and change from baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic 
Dermatitis (PSAAD) total score at week 12. 
The key secondary endpoints in study B7451029 were the response based on achieving at least 4-
points improvement in the severity of pruritus numerical rating scale (PP-NRS4) from baseline at 
weeks 2, response based on achieving the IGA of clear (0) or almost clear (1) and a reduction from 
baseline of ≥2 points at week 16 and response based on achieving EASI-75 (≥75% improvement from 
baseline) at week 16.  
All key secondary endpoints are considered important and of clinical relevance. 
Several other secondary efficacy endpoints and patient-reported outcome endpoints were evaluated 
during the pivotal clinical studies.  
The study objectives and outcomes are considered adequate for studies evaluating a new product with 
the proposed therapeutic indication. The number of subjects and the duration of treatment are in 
accordance with the requirements of EMA guidelines. The studies had a comparative design either to 
placebo or to the active comparator dupilumab (Dupixent). Hence, there was an objective related to 
superiority and randomisation and blinding were necessary. The study designs are overall accepted, 
there were however some issues requiring further clarification are discussed below.   
The extent/maturity of the data package submitted (not all phase 3 studies were completed yet) is 
considered adequate to allow for informed decision on the benefits (and risks) of abrocitinib in the 
targeted indication. However, upcoming data from ongoing studies were reviewed to make sure that 
they are consistent with available results from the pivotal trials. By now study B7451014 and 
B7451036 have completed and updated efficacy data has been provided from study B7451015 with a 
new data cut-off of 08 January 2021 (the initial data cut-off for the initial submission was 22 April 
2020). Study B7451015 is still ongoing, which is acknowledged, no final study report was expected. 
For Study B7451014 and B7451036 adequate study documentation has been submitted upon request 
from the CHMP. New/updated outcomes are discussed below. 
Statistical aspects 
Monotherapy studies B7451012 and B7451013 
The samples size estimation is considered to be appropriate. Masking of randomised assignments was 
to be achieved using matching placebo and double-dummy technique which is appropriate for its 
purpose. There did not seem to have been any approach planned to assure that a minimum number of 
adolescents were randomised. Within the CHMP SA (EMEA/SAH/085/2/2017/IIII) the applicant was 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 130/216 
 
 
 
cautioned that if specific claims for this age group were to be supported, a sufficient number of 
patients of this age range was needed. In this respect it should be acknowledged that efficacy among 
adolescents only was not a study objective in any of the studies. Also, as stated in the PIP compliance 
report (EMEA-C1-002312-PIP01-17-M01), the number of study participants by paediatric subset was to 
be at least 30 subjects evaluable for the primary analysis; a measure that was deemed PIP compliant 
for both study B7451012 and study B7451013. Further, abrocitinib performance in adolescents was 
evaluated specifically in study B7451036/TEEN and respective results have been provided upon 
request from the CHMP. 
The monotherapy studies were identical in design and the SAP for each study was in all important 
aspects identical. Both SAPs were finalised before database lock (and unblinding) and the applicant 
confirmed that all analyses were carried out as detailed in the final SAP (study B7451012: version 4, 
23 April 2019, study B7451013: version 2, dated 26 August 2019) but for a number of exceptions in 
the analysis of study B7451012 (described and justified; no major concerns are raised). Overall, the 
statistical analysis plan(s) were appropriate. The multiple testing procedure (MTP), the analysis of 
binary endpoints including the use of non-responder imputation (NRI) and the use of MMRM were 
commented in line with the CHMP SA (EMEA/SAH/085/2/2017/IIII) and largely also supported by the 
CHMP.  
Study B7451012 was initiated in December 2017 and study B7451013 in June 2018. When a technical 
error in the process of transmission and collection of electronic data was found in study B7451012, 
mitigatory measures could be implemented in study B7451013. In study B7451012, this led to was 
missing data for several subjects at scheduled visits of week 2 (Day 15) and after for the pruritus NRS 
scale, a key secondary endpoint. According to the applicant, the main reason for this appeared to be 
that study sites had not been provided with adequately detailed instructions on how to operate the 
handheld devices used to record the PP-NRS. Eventually, a smaller proportion of subjects had missing 
PP-NRS data in study B7451013 than in study B7451012. Between 30% to 40% and 12% to 24% of 
randomised subjects seemed to have been impacted for studies B7451012 and B7451013, 
respectively. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant presented number of subjects with missing 
data in total, imputed using NRI and imputed using MI and for each analysis time-point by randomised 
arms and study, respectively. More subjects in the placebo arm discontinued early and hence, the use 
of NRI was more common in the placebo arm. At week 8 and week 12, missing data was overall more 
common in the placebo arms with missing data due to technical issues fairly well balanced between 
randomised arms within each study. Most missing due to a technical error occurred in study B7451012 
and at week 4 there was also an imbalance between placebo and active arms with the number of 
subjects concerned being 15/74 (20.3%), 49/157 (33.3%) and 57/147 (38.8%) in the placebo, the 
100mg and the 200mg arm, respectively. This could in part be explained by the higher proportion in 
the placebo arm of subjects with missing data due to early discontinuation for which NRI was used. For 
especially the 200mg arm in study B7451012 and the week 4 analysis, there was a non-neglectable 
loss in number of actually observed responses. To further explore any impact on primary conclusions, 
analyses excluding those with missing data due to technical error was in addition requested by the 
CHMP and provided by the applicant (see further below).  
All efficacy and PRO analyses were performed using the full analysis set defined as all randomised 
subjects who had received at least one dose and by the applicant is expected to be identical to a true 
ITT analysis set since the first dose was administered in-clinic. Overall, this was also shown to be true 
in both studies and thereby, the primary analysis population is endorsed. However, to be included in 
the PP-NRS analysis subjects were to have a baseline score ≥4. Although the approach could be 
comprehended, excluding subjects in the analysis with a baseline value <4 was not agreed thus new 
analyses were requested. As clear from re-analyses of PP-NRS data; also including those who did not 
meet the requirement of a baseline PP-NRS of at least 4 had overall only minor impact given the small

number of subjects excluded in the original analyses. However, in the week 4 analysis of 100mg vs 
placebo in study B7451012, the p-value for the difference was 0.1062. Considering the addition of only 
9 and 3 subjects in the 100mg and placebo arm respectively, this could be considered to signal a lack 
of robustness in the original analysis. Nevertheless, this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP. 
Overall, the analyses requested by the CHMP supported the primary (original) analyses.  
Although not optimally described in the figure provided as part of this application, the multiple testing 
procedure including re-cycling of alpha is considered acceptable. The co-primary and all but one of key 
secondary endpoints were binary/responder endpoints for which the same approach for test and 
estimation was applied. For testing of hypotheses and estimation of treatment differences, the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted by randomisation strata has been used which is supported. In 
case of study withdrawal or use of rescue, subjects were considered non-responders. This could in 
general be agreed but may not be sufficiently conservative depending on missing data pattern.  Here it 
has been shown to be in favour of active treatments in that more subjects in the placebo arms than in 
abrocitinib arms, discontinued prematurely. For sensitivity purpose, Tipping point analyses (TP) based 
on both MAR and MNAR, have been performed. These are endorsed. In both studies they were shown 
to support a statistically significant difference between each abrocitinib dose and placebo respectively 
for both the IGA and the EASI-75 endpoints also under the scenario corresponding to Jump-to-
reference and MNAR. There was no formal comparison planned nor performed between the two 
abrocitinib dose groups. The difference has however been estimated with corresponding 95% CI. This 
is endorsed. 
However, methods specified to estimate confidence intervals for the effect sizes corresponding to 
primary and secondary endpoints included in the multiple testing procedure were not adjusted for 
multiplicity, such that the actual coverage probability of the simultaneous confidence region (covering 
the corresponding effect size estimate) may be substantially lower. This issue affects effect size 
estimates corresponding to primary and key-secondary endpoints. The applicant was requested to 
provide confidence intervals with simultaneous coverage probability of 95% two-sided (or 97.5% one-
sided) that are compatible with the sequentially rejective multiple testing. In their response, the 
applicant claimed that no adjustment of CI was necessary for results from studies B7451012 and 
B7451013, because all null hypotheses considered in the sequentially rejective multiple test procedure 
are rejected. That is in line with simultaneous CIs proposed in Strassburger & Bretz (2008) and hence 
is accepted by CHMP.  
Given the amount of missing PP-NRS data in study B7451012, the primary approach for handling 
missing in the analysis of this key secondary endpoint was changed (SAP version 4, 23 April 2019); 
from a failure/non-responder imputation (NRI) to a method that was to depend on whether 
intermittently or monotony missing. The applicant argues that those missing due to a technical error 
could be assumed to be missing at random and used a hybrid approach (NRI+MI) to replace data. In 
their argumentation it was pointed out that the error was not restricted to a particular site or country 
and was not indicative of being related to the missing value of pruritus endpoint or any other 
endpoints. Although unfortunate, the missing at random assumption appeared plausible. The amount 
of missing PP-NRS data was not as pronounced in study B7451013 but for comparison the same 
analyses were performed also for study B7451013 which is appreciated. A sensitivity analysis was 
performed (in both studies) in which all subjects with missing data was imputed as non-responders. 
Overall, primary PP-NRS4 outcomes were shown to be reasonably consistent across studies. The 
differences in study B7451012, each active dose versus placebo, was slightly smaller compared with 
study B7451013, which became more evident in the sensitivity analyses using NRI alone. In the 
requested analyses excluding subjects with missing data due to technical issues, there were no 
important differences in the proportion of subjects achieving PP-NRS ≥4-point improvement from 
baseline or the p-values for comparisons between arms at any of the analysis time-point compared 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 132/216 
 
 
 
with the original analyses but for the week 4 analysis of 100mg vs placebo in study B7451012 where 
the p-value for the difference was 0.0718. This is considered to pertain to the limitations in group size 
and that the difference versus placebo was smaller for the 100 mg than the 200 mg arm.  
Continuous secondary endpoints, among them the key secondary endpoint, change from baseline in 
‘Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis’ (PSAAD) score at week 12, were analysed 
using MMRM. Within the CHMP SA (EMEA/SAH/085/2/2017/IIII), the then planned sensitivity analysis 
was not endorsed and advice was given on options on how to handle missing data in an analysis for 
sensitivity purpose. With the only sensitivity analysis offered based on the PPS, additional analyses 
were requested. In their responses, the applicant provided a sensitivity analysis in which NRI was used 
in case of discontinuations while intermittent missing was imputed based on MNAR in active arms and 
MAR in the placebo arm. Using this approach, the outcomes were shown to be very similar compared 
with primary analyses outcomes, probably explained by the fact that more subjects in the placebo arm 
than in active arms discontinued early and were imputed as non-responders. NRI could generally be 
agreed in case of study/treatment discontinuation, albeit, depending on missing data pattern, may not 
be sufficiently conservative. Given what is considered convincing statistical evidence from the original 
as well the currently presented sensitivity analysis and based on the similarities in both estimates and 
p-values (both studies), this issue was not further pursued. 
Furthermore, the need for and amount of rescue medication should also be considered as intercurrent 
event and be documented and analysed. In the analyses for binary endpoints, subjects who required a 
rescue medication were defined as “non-responders” at all subsequent visits. It was unknown which 
strategy (e.g. hypothetical strategy, treatment policy strategy) was used for these subjects in the 
sensitivity analyses for the binary endpoints using multiple imputation or for secondary analyses for 
continuous endpoints. The applicant explained that no rescue treatment was permitted in the studies 
and that the raised concern was likely due to a misleading formulation in the study protocol. This is 
accepted.  
The PSAAD is a PRO developed by the applicant and contained in the application is a “EMA PRO Briefing 
book” describing development and validation exercises. An initial psychometric evaluation of the 
PSAAD was conducted using data from the phase 2b study (B7451006) while the confirmatory 
evaluation was based on data pooled across treatment arms from the phase 3 monotherapy studies. 
Validation exercises is considered to have been acceptable and is considered further supported by the 
outcomes in that a clear trend was shown across treatment arms within each study further supported 
by study B7451029 outcomes. However, the applicant used the notion “preliminary PSAAD” and 
described item 12-15 as included for further validation. No further mention regarding analysis or 
conclusions of any validation exercise based on item 12-15 were found. Upon request from the CHMP, 
the applicant clarified that items 12-15 were included for future (post-hoc) analyses and that no formal 
validation exercise based on these items has been conducted or planned. This is accepted. In addition, 
separate analyses of each of the 11 PSAAD items were requested to elucidate to what extent all items 
contributed to the PSAAD overall outcome (mean change from baseline) or whether foremost driven by 
a few items alone. Based on the results provided, it is agreed that there were improvements from 
baseline to week 12 across all items with what appears to have been similar patterns across both visits 
and treatment arms irrespective of item and confirmed comparing the studies. 
Combination therapy study (B7451029) 
Eligible subjects were randomised in a 4:4:4:1:1 ratio to receive 100 mg or 200 mg of abrocitinib or 
dupilumab or to one of two sequences of placebo for 16 weeks followed by either 100 mg or 200 mg of 
abrocitinib QD. For the purpose of the primary (final, week 16) analysis the two placebo sequences 
were combined which is acceptable. Randomisation was only stratified for study centre interpreted as 
being for administrative reasons only. In the study protocol it was explicitly stated that randomisation 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 133/216 
 
 
 
was not to be stratified for disease severity or age. Regarding age this study enrolled adults only. 
While study centre was not considered in the analyses, analyses were performed adjusted by baseline 
disease severity. Despite not being a stratification factor, the proportion of subjects with moderate and 
severe disease were shown to be well balanced between treatments. Due to viscosity differences 
between dupilumab and the matched placebo, and a potential for functional unblinding of the 
administrator/trainer, the administrator/trainer was to be treated as if unblind and was to be isolated 
from all other study activities. The approach to achieve blinding of randomised treatment appears 
appropriate although the use of not identically matching dupilumab placebo is not ideal. Previous 
treatment with dupilumab was however an exclusion criterion and the risk that a subject could have 
guessed whether he/she had been randomised to the dupilumab arm should hence have been minor. 
Study B7451029 shared a number of features with the two identical monotherapy studies; primary and 
a number of secondary endpoints, analysis sets and their definitions, the tests and models used in the 
analyses and missing data handling. Thereby, similar comments as for the monotherapy studies 
applied thus the applicant was requested to provide confidence intervals with simultaneous coverage 
probability of 95% two-sided (or 97.5% one-sided) that are compatible with the sequentially rejective 
multiple testing and to clarify which strategy (e.g. hypothetical strategy, treatment policy strategy) 
was used for subjects needing rescue in the sensitivity analyses for the binary endpoints using multiple 
imputation or for secondary analyses for continuous endpoints. This was adequately addressed. As for 
studies B7451012 and B745103, it was explained that no rescue treatment was permitted in the study 
and that the raised concern was likely due to a misleading formulation in the study protocol. This is 
accepted. Furthermore, the same alpha reallocation method as for B7451012/MONO 1 and 
B7451013/MONO 2 was used, but with different hypotheses and order of hypotheses due to the 
additional dupilumab comparisons. However, a step-down approach with the NRS4 endpoint from week 
2 to earlier time points was used as an additional family of hypothesis tests separate from the 
described MTP once statistical significance was demonstrated at week 2 for each of the comparisons. 
The multiple type I error rate is however not protected when including this step-down procedure to 
test also earlier time-points. Therefore, the additional analyses of NRS4 at earlier time-points will only 
be considered exploratory and not part of the multiple testing procedure. 
Compared to version 1, SAP version 2 (23 January 2020) foremost implemented changes concerning 
some secondary (non-key) endpoints and raise no concern. The primary completion date was 27 
December 2019 and the primary (final, week 16) analysis now presented were based on a database 
release 05 February 2020. The primary efficacy assessment was at week 12 and used the same two 
co-primary endpoints as defined for the monotherapy studies. Key secondary efficacy assessments 
were at week 2 and week 16. Except for one subject, randomised to dupilumab but did not receive any 
treatment, all randomised subjects were included in the FAS.  
Also, in this study, there were a number of subjects with missing PP-NRS data. Importantly they seem 
to have been similarly distributed between treatment arms; the proportion of subjects with missing 
data at any study visit from Day 15 forward ranged from 18% to 22%. It is however acknowledged 
that at time-points earlier than week 2, the proportion of subjects with one or more missing during the 
first 14 days of dosing ranged from 39% to 44%; one possible explanation being that during the first 
14 days, subjects were to their pruritus severity on a daily basis. In study B7451029, PSAAD was 
among the PROs used and was included as a secondary endpoint but was not identified to be of key 
interest (compared with other PROs). 
Overall, the pivotal studies have been designed in agreement with scientific advice provided by the 
CHMP and the NCA. 
Concerning GCP aspects, no concerns have been identified based on the review of the studies.

Monotherapy studies B7451012 and B7451013 
Study B7451012 was performed at 69 centres in 8 countries in the US, Canada and the EU. Study 
B7451013 was performed at 102 centres in 13 countries in the US, Canada, EU and Asia. It is 
considered an advantage with inclusion of subjects from different regions of the world. In both studies, 
completion rates were high (≥ 86.7%) in all active treatment groups. The completion rate was 
however lower in the placebo groups, 79.2% in study B7451012 and 66.7% in study B7451013. 
Subjects in the placebo group discontinued due to lack of efficacy and withdrawal by subject/guardian. 
Groups treated with abrocitinib discontinued due to adverse events which peaked in the 200 mg QD 
dose group in study B7451012, lack of efficacy and withdrawal by subject/guardian in study 
B7451013. 
In Study B7451012, important protocol deviations were reported in 94%, in the category of 
procedures or tests, of which a missing NRS assessment at any study visit from day 15 forward 
occurred most frequently. Other reasons were related to errors with laboratory results, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, took prohibited concomitant medication, and dosing/administration errors 
of investigational product/study medication. 
Treatment compliance was high, the mean dose compliance was 98%, 99% and 97% in the abrocitinib 
200mg QD, abrocitinib 100mg QD, and placebo groups, respectively. 
In Study B7451013, important protocol deviations were reported in 86%, in the category of 
procedures or tests, of which a missing NRS assessment occurred most frequently. Other reasons were 
related to errors with laboratory results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, took prohibited concomitant 
medication, and dosing/administration errors of investigational product/study medication. 
Treatment compliance was high, the mean (SD%) dose compliance was 97% across treatment groups.  
Overall, the impact of the protocol deviations in both monotherapy studies (B7451012 and B7451013) 
is considered to be minor on the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib.  
In Study B7451012, the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population comprised 387 subjects and the Per 
Protocol Analysis (PPAS) population comprised 321 subjects. In Study B7451013, the FAS population 
comprised 391 subjects and the PPAS population comprised 310 subjects. Most subjects were males in 
both studies, females comprised approximately 40 % of the study populations. The median age was 29 
and 31 years of age in studies B7451012 and B7451013, respectively. In study B7451012, 84 subjects 
(21.7%) were below 18 years of age. Of those, 39 subjects were between 12-≤15 of age, and 45 
subjects between 15-≤18 years of age. The corresponding figure for study B7451013 was 40 subjects 
(10.2%) that were below 18 years of age. Of those, 10 subjects were between 12-≤15 of age and 30 
subjects between 15-≤18 years of age. There is thus a slight asymmetry between the studies 
regarding participating number of adolescents, with higher percentage of adolescents in study 
B7451012. The discrepancy in the number of adolescents between the studies is acknowledged, 
although a more balanced inclusion of subjects would have been preferred. The number of adolescents 
in the pivotal monotherapy studies is not considered large, with most subjects being between 12-≤15 
of age but accepted, since the clinical picture of moderate to severe AD and treatment options is 
overall similar between adolescents and adults. 
Most subjects were white although subjects with Asian descent or Black/African American also were 
represented, which is viewed as an advantage. The number of subjects of Asian descent was slightly 
higher in study B7451013 compared with study B7451012, while the number of Black/African 
American were similar across the studies. The proportion of subjects from Western Europe and Eastern 
Europe/Russia were 41% and 45% in studies B7451012 and B7451013, respectively. 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 135/216 
 
 
 
In Study B7451012, 59% had moderate AD and 41% severe AD according to established disease 
criteria, while the corresponding values for study B7451013 were 68% with moderate AD and 32% 
with severe AD. The mean disease duration was 20 years for the monotherapy studies. Baseline 
disease characteristics of the abrocitinib clinical programme is considered consistent with those of 
patients with moderate-to-severe AD.  
There were no remarkable findings with respect to medical history, or prior and concomitant 
medications in either of the monotherapy studies. Prior medication use was similar between treatment 
arms. Approximately half of subjects had prior exposure to topical agents only, while the other half of 
the subjects had prior exposure to systemic agents (the majority of which were non-biologics). In 
Study B7451012 ~8% had been treated with dupilumab, the corresponding figure for study 
B7451013 is ~4%. 
For the subgroup analyses of B7451012 and B7451013 concerning continuous variables such as age, 
plots were requested by the CHMP to investigate how the estimated effect of treatment changes over 
the range of the factor separately for both treatments. It appears that there may be an association 
between age and treatment effect - especially for the lower dose - with younger subjects showing 
reduced response to treatment compared to older. It was clarified that this was merely a reflection of 
baseline difference (younger subjects had more severe disease at baseline, which was not accounted for 
in the analysis), which was considered comprehensible.  
Combination therapy Study B7451029  
Study B7451029 was performed at 194 centres in 18 countries including the US, Canada, South 
America, EU and Asia. It is, as stated above, considered an advantage with inclusion of subjects from 
different regions of the world including Asia and South America. Completion rates was high (≥ 89.3%) 
in all treatment groups and higher in study B7451029 compared with the monotherapy studies 
B7451012 and B7451013. The reasons for discontinuation were adverse events and withdrawal by 
subject in placebo groups which also was the most frequent reason for discontinuation in the 
abrocitinib 100 mg group, while adverse event was frequent reason for discontinuation in the 
abrocitinib 200 mg group. Withdrawal by subject / adverse event were equally frequent reasons for 
discontinuation in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. 
In study B7451029, important protocol deviations were reported in 85%, the most frequent in the 
category of procedures or tests, of which a missing NRS assessment occurred most frequently. Other 
reasons were related to errors concomitant medication, dosing/administration errors of investigational 
product/study medication and laboratory results. The impact of the protocol deviations is considered to 
be minor on the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib.  
Treatment compliance was high, the mean (SD%) dose compliance was 100% across all treatment 
groups.  
In study B7451029, the FAS population comprised 838 subjects and the PPAS population comprised 
600 subjects. Most subjects were males as in the monotherapy studies. The median age was 34 years 
of age. A small proportion of subjects were older than 65 (n=54; 6.3%). 
Most subjects were white (72.4%) although subjects with Asian (21.3%) of Black/African American 
(4.2%) descent were also represented, viewed as an advantage. The proportion of subjects from 
Western Europe and Eastern Europe/Russia were 51%. 
The mean disease duration was 21.8 years. 64.6% had moderate AD and 35.4% severe according to 
established criteria. The pruritus numbering rating scale (NRS) showed that the subjects had moderate 
itch (7).

There were no remarkable findings with respect to medical history, or prior and concomitant 
medications in the study. Prior medication use was similar between treatment arms. Approximately 
half of subjects (56.5%) had prior exposure to topical agents only, the other half of the subjects had 
prior exposure to systemic agents (non-biologic or biologic, excluding dupilumab). 
Efficacy results 
In study B7451012, both co-primary efficacy endpoints were met when evaluated at week 12. The 
proportion of subjects who achieved an IGA response of clear or almost clear and a more than 2 points 
improvement from baseline at week 12, was statistically significant for both the 100 mg group 23.7 
(17.0, 30.4) and the 200 mg group 43.8 (35.9, 51.7) compared with placebo group 7.9 (1.8, 14.0).  
The proportion of subjects who achieved an EASI response of >= 75% improvement from baseline at 
week 12, was for the 100 mg group 39.7 (32.1, 47.4) and the 200 mg group 62.7 (55.1, 70.4) 
compared with placebo 11.8 (4.6, 19.1).  
Superiority of abrocitinib versus placebo was demonstrated for both doses investigated, 100 mg QD 
and 200 mg QD. A dose-response relationship was demonstrated, with the highest level of efficacy 
obtained for the dose 200 mg QD. The results are assessed of clinical relevance in the investigated 
target population moderate to severe AD. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were ≥4 points improvement from baseline in the peak pruritus 
NRS scale (PP-NRS4) at weeks 2, 4 and 12, and the change from baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms 
Assessment for AD (PSAAD).  
In the PP-NRS4 analysis week 12, a dose-dependent efficacy was demonstrated for abrocitinib 100 mg, 
and for abrocitinib 200 mg versus the placebo group. A statistically significant efficacy on itch is 
obtained already at week 2. The maximum efficacy evaluated as PP-NRS-4 seems to be obtained in 
week 4. 
Superiority of abrocitinib 100 mg QD (p<0.001) and 200 mg QD compared with vehicle (p<0.001) 
were demonstrated also for itch evaluated by PSAAD.  
In study B7451013, both co-primary efficacy endpoints were met. The proportion of subjects who 
achieved an IGA response of clear or almost clear and a more than 2 points improvement from 
baseline at week 12, was statistically significant for both the 100 mg group 28.4 (21.3, 35.5) and the 
200 mg group 38.1 (30.4, 45.7) compared with placebo 9.1 (2.7, 15.5).  
The proportion of subjects who achieved an EASI response of >= 75% improvement from baseline at 
week 12, was for the 100 mg group 44.5 (36.7, 52.3) and the 200 mg group 61.0 (53.3, 68.7) 
compared with placebo 10.4 (3.6, 17.2).  
Superiority of abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD versus placebo was thus demonstrated. A dose-
response relationship was shown, with the highest level of efficacy obtained for the dose 200 mg QD.  
The results are of clinical relevance in the investigated target population moderate to severe AD. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were ≥4 points improvement from baseline in the peak pruritus 
NRS scale (PP-NRS4) at weeks 2, 4 and 12, and the change from baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms 
Assessment for AD (PSAAD).  
In the PP-NRS4 analysis week 12, a dose-dependent efficacy was demonstrated for abrocitinib 100 mg, 
and for abrocitinib 200 mg compared with the placebo group. A statistically significant efficacy on itch 
is obtained already at week 2. The maximum efficacy evaluated as PP-NRS-4 seems to be obtained 
during week 4-8.

Superiority of abrocitinib 100 mg QD (p<0.0001) and 200 mg QD to vehicle (p<0.0001) were 
demonstrated also for itch evaluated by PSAAD.  
In study B7451029, the proportion of subjects who achieved an IGA response of clear or almost clear 
and a more than 2 points improvement from baseline at week 12, was statistically significant for both 
the 100 mg group 36.6 (30.4, 42.8), the 200 mg group 48.4 (41.8, 55.0) and dupilumab 36.5 (30.4, 
42.6) compared with the placebo group 14.0 (8.0, 19.9).  
The proportion of subjects who achieved an EASI response of >= 75% improvement from baseline at 
week 12, was for the 100 mg group 58.7 (52.4, 65.0), the 200 mg group 70.3 (64.3, 76.4), dupilumab 
58.1 (51.9, 64.3) and for placebo 27.1 (19.5, 34.8).  
Superiority of abrocitinib 100 mg QD, 200 mg QD and dupilumab versus placebo was demonstrated.  
The results with to co-primary endpoints IGA and EASI-75 demonstrated a similar level of efficacy for 
abrocitinib 100 mg QD and for dupilumab, while abrocitinib 200 mg QD was superior to dupilumab 
when dosed according to approved product information.  
Additional supportive analyses were performed for the PPAS population, and for the FAS population 
using a TP analysis where all missing responses were multiply imputed, and with imputation using 
dropout reason. The results were consistent with the results of the FAS primary analyses.  
Efficacy of abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD versus dupilumab 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were at least a 4 points improvement in the severity of Pruritus 
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from baseline at week 2, a response based on achieving the IGA of 
clear (0) or almost clear (1) (on a 5-point scale) and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at week 
16 and a response based on achieving EASI-75 (≥75% improvement from baseline) at week 16. 
PP-NRS4 responder proportion at week 2 was statistically significantly higher for abrocitinib 100 mg 
and for 200 mg compared with placebo. Abrocitinib 200 mg QD had statistically significantly higher 
proportion of PP-NRS4 responders at week 2 compared with dupilumab, while the difference between 
abrocitinib 100 mg and dupilumab at week 2 did not reach statistical significance. 
IGA responder proportion at week 16, was statistically significantly higher for abrocitinib 100 mg 34.8 
(28.6, 40.9) and for abrocitinib 200 mg 47.5 (40.9, 54.1) compared with placebo 12.9 (7.0, 18.8). 
When compared with dupilumab, treatment effect (IGA responder proportion corrected for placebo) at 
week 16 was greater with abrocitinib 200 mg QD than dupilumab 38.8 (32.5, 45.1), and similar 
between abrocitinib 100 mg QD and dupilumab.  
For the third key secondary efficacy endpoint, proportion of EASI-75 responders, a statistically 
significantly higher efficacy for abrocitinib 100 mg 60.3 (53.9, 66.6) and for abrocitinib 200 mg 71.0 
(65.1, 77.0) compared with placebo 30.6 (22.5, 38.8) was noted. When compared with dupilumab, 
treatment effect (EASI-75 responder proportion corrected for placebo) at week 16 was greater with 
abrocitinib 200 mg QD than dupilumab, and similar between abrocitinib 100 mg QD and dupilumab.  
Efficacy of medicated topical therapy when added to abrocitinib and dupilumab 
In the combination therapy study B7451029, several treatment options were allowed (topical 
corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) or a PDE4 inhibitor (e.g., 
crisaborole) may be used instead of corticosteroids.  
The applicant tried to calculate a net extra effect of abrocitinib plus topical corticosteroids. There was 
no evidence of clinically meaningful absolute or relative increase in treatment effect for EASI-75 or PP-
NRS4 response. The applicant does not propose to add wording on an increase in treatment effect with 
the addition of medicated topical therapy to abrocitinib in the SmPC.

Effect of seasonal variations 
There is no concern of seasonal variations on treatment with abrocitinib since the performed clinical 
trials were performed at different location all over the world which covers different seasonal variations. 
Analysis performed across trials – magnitude of treatment effect 
A comparison of efficacy results across all pivotal studies (B7451012, B7451013 and B7451029) 
was made. In each individual phase 3 monotherapy or combination therapy study, both doses of 
abrocitinib met each of the co-primary endpoints. Abrocitinib 200 mg QD consistently had a higher 
magnitude of effect than 100 mg QD. The differences from placebo were statistically significant and are 
assessed as clinically relevant.   
In the two phase 3 monotherapy studies, treatment effect for each abrocitinib dose was similar across 
studies for each of the key secondary endpoints. Abrocitinib 200 mg QD consistently had a higher 
magnitude of effect than 100 mg QD.  
In the combination therapy study, treatment effect for each abrocitinib dose on the key secondary 
endpoint PP-NRS4 at week 2 was like that observed in the monotherapy pool, with evidence of dose-
dependent increase in treatment effect. 
The time-course of IGA, EASI-75 and PP-NRS4 responses of monotherapy and combination therapy 
showed that the effect on itch (PP-NRS4) is observed sooner than the effect on overall AD symptoms 
detected by IGA-75 and EASI.  
Sub-group analyses  
Subgroup analyses by intrinsic factors (age, sex, race ethnicity, weight and body mass index, disease 
severity by IGA and EASI, percent BSA affected by AD, and comorbidities) and extrinsic factors 
(geographic region and prior therapy for AD) demonstrated that effects of each dose of abrocitinib 
were similar across subgroups for the co-primary endpoints IGA and EASI-75. The effects of each dose 
of abrocitinib were similar across subgroups also for the key secondary efficacy endpoint PP-NRS4. 
Both abrocitinib doses were efficacious regardless of the subject’s baseline severity or extent of AD.   
Clinical studies in special populations 
Adolescents were included in both the monotherapy studies, 84 subjects in study B7451012 and 40 
subjects in study B7451013. The combination therapy study B7451029 only included adults. The oldest 
individual in study B7451012 was 84 years, 83 years in study B7451013 and 84 years of age in study 
B7451029. 
No special studies in children have been performed. The disease characteristics is similar in adults and 
adolescents with moderate to severe AD. Moreover, the treatment options are overall similar. The 
absence of adolescents in the combination therapy study could be considered a shortcoming of study 
B7451029, which has been extensively discussed by the applicant. The arguments (similar disease 
characteristics and treatment options as in adults) are overall accepted. Furthermore, a study with 
similar design as in study B7451029 with concomitant medicated topical therapy in adolescents is 
ongoing. 
Duration of treatment effect – need for retreatment 
The Phase 3 study B7451014 was designed to evaluate and compare the maintenance of effect of two 
doses of abrocitinib and placebo in subjects aged 12 and above with moderate to severe AD who 
responded to an initial open-label run-in treatment of 200 mg abrocitinib QD. Data from week 12 were 
consistent with the short-term efficacy demonstrated for abrocitinib 200 mg QD in the individual Phase 
2b and Phase 3 monotherapy studies.

Long-term efficacy 
Phase 3 Study B7451015 was designed to estimate the long-term efficacy and safety of 100 mg and 
200 mg QD abrocitinib with or without topical treatments in adult and adolescent subjects who 
previously participated in qualifying abrocitinib AD trials.  
Updated efficacy data submitted at D121 of the procedure indicate that after a quick onset the effect 
stabilises after about 24 weeks and tends to pertain or decrease a bit at 48 weeks. Upon request from 
the CHMP, the applicant discussed the slight decrease in response rate and found ‘the fluctuating 
nature of the disease’ or ‘regression to the mean’ potential causes of this observation. Data > 48 
weeks supported the maintenance of the abrocitinib effect over time. The applicant committed to 
submitting a post-approval type II variation to further update SmPC section 5.1, if required, by 31 
December 2022. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the three pivotal studies had an adequate design. A statistically significant, and dose-
dependent efficacy of abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD versus placebo was demonstrated in 
patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis from 12 years of age and above. The observed level 
of clinical efficacy is assessed to be of clinical relevance. Cibinqo can be administered together with 
medicated topical therapy (most often topical corticosteroids).  
The current application includes a direct comparison with dupilumab. The efficacy of abrocitinib 100 mg 
QD is comparable to the efficacy of the active comparator dupilumab, while abrocitinib 200 mg QD is 
superior to dupilumab in overall AD endpoints, but most markedly on itch, the most troublesome 
symptom. 
Nevertheless, from a safety perspective, the CHMP considered that the effect of abrocitinib on 
developing bone should be more thoroughly characterised including relevant long-term data before a 
potential use in adolescents can be further assessed (see Safety section). Therefore, the therapeutic 
indication was restricted to adults only. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Pooling strategy: There are 3 pre-specified safety pools, the Primary Safety Pool (Primary Pool), the All 
Exposure Safety Pool (All Exposure Pool) and the Phase 1 Safety Pool.  In this document, the Primary 
Safety Pool will be referred to as the Primary Pool and the All Exposure Safety Pool will be referred to 
as the All Exposure Pool.  
• 
The Primary Pool includes studies with a placebo comparator, of similar duration (12 16 
weeks), same doses of abrocitinib, similar patient population, and comparable safety outcome 
assessment.  The similarities in the study design, patient population, and assessment justify the 
pooling of these studies. 
• 
The All Exposure Pool includes all subjects who received at least one dose of abrocitinib in all 
Phase 2b and 3 studies of subjects with AD from the relevant dosing groups (100 mg QD and 200 mg 
QD), including the LTE study.  For ongoing studies, the cutoff date was 22 April 2020.  Day 1 for all 
subjects is the first day of exposure to abrocitinib 100 or 200 mg QD.   
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 140/216 
 
 
 
In addition, there was a Phase 1 Safety Pool including 15 completed Phase 1 studies (please refer to 
the efficacy section for tables summarising these studies). The focus in this safety assessment will be 
on the Primary Safety and All Exposure pools.  
A total of 2856 subjects with AD were exposed to abrocitinib during the development programme. 
Among these subjects 885 were exposed to 100 mg QD and 1971 to 200 mg QD.

2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Overall, in the Primary Pool there were more treatment emergent adverse events in the abrocitinib-
treated groups compared to placebo (Table 42). 
The proportion of subjects with treatment related TEAEs was similar between the abrocitinib 100 mg 
QD and placebo treatment groups and higher in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD treatment group. Of the all 
causality TEAEs, 29.1% to 41.2% were considered treatment-related by the Investigator.

Age-Primary Safety Pool 
The PT ‘nausea’ is the most commonly reported adverse reaction, together with ‘vomiting’ within the 
SOC gastrointestinal disorders demonstrating a dose relationship. According to the applicant, data 
indicates that the mechanism may be related to local gastric concentration of abrocitinib suggesting 
the risk of nausea which may be mitigated by taking abrocitinib with food for those that experience it. 
This is based on the findings in two Phase 1 studies (B7451004 and B7451032) examining abrocitinib 
exposure in the fed and fasted state.  
The percentage of TEAEs are somewhat higher in adolescents compared to the total population within 
the Primary safety pool. The TEAEs within the placebo treated group on the other hand are not higher 
in adolescents, rather similar or slightly less. Based on the higher percentage of TEAEs in adolescents 
and the assumption of dose dependent TEAES, the applicant was requested by the CHMP to discuss 
this in relation to abrocitinib exposure in adolescents. According to the table of Treatment-Emergent 
Adverse Events by System Organ Class (All Causalities) by Baseline Age Primary Safety Pool- there is a 
clear discrepancy and increase of percentage of reported TEAEs within the SOC “Respiratory, Thoracic 
And Mediastinal Disorders” of abrocitinib treated subjects < 18 years of age compared to placebo and

compared to all subjects. Further, the applicant was requested to comment, present and discuss 
further data of these 11 (eleven) cases whereof 10 were reported from the abrocitinib treated groups. 
All Exposure Pool 
There was a similar proportion of subjects reporting AEs in the 2 treatment groups (Table 13). There 
were slightly more subjects with SAEs, severe AEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal in the 100 mg QD 
treatment group. The proportion of subjects with treatment-related TEAEs was higher in the abrocitinib 
200 mg QD treatment group. Among all causality AEs, 38.6% were considered treatment-related by 
the Investigator 
Table 46 Abrocitinib Summary of Clinical Safety (Atopic Dermatitis) Treatment- Emergent 
Adverse Events (All Causalities) 
The SOCs with the highest proportion of events in abrocitinib treatment groups were Infections and 
infestations, Gastrointestinal disorders, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, Nervous system 
disorders, and Investigations. The most frequent AEs by PT were similar to those in the Primary Pool. 
The only additional AE with a dose response was abdominal pain upper. Of treatment related TEAEs 
that occurred in ≥2% of subjects, nausea was most frequently reported. The majority of treatment 
related TEAEs were mild or moderate.

the most frequent TEAEs by PT and a demonstrated dose relationship. In addition, a dose relationship 
is indicated also for the PT upper abdominal pain.

Dupilumab comparator study 
Separate study B7451029 contained both a placebo and dupilumab comparator arm.

Causalities) – Safety Analysis Set 
Safety in study B7451029 and Dupilumab Non-responders 
• 
• 
The incidence of subjects reporting adverse events was higher in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD 
group compared to the abrocitinib 100 mg QD, dupilumab, and placebo treatment groups. 
The percentages of subjects reporting SAEs, severe adverse events, and adverse events 
leading to study discontinuation were low and similar across the abrocitinib, placebo, and 
dupilumab treatment groups. 
•  Abrocitinib treated subjects were more likely to experience nausea, herpes simplex, acne, and 
herpes zoster. Dupilumab treated subjects were more likely to experience conjunctivitis. 
• 
There was no unique safety signal in the dupilumab non-responder subgroup. 
Subjects in the combination topical subgroup (combination therapy study (B7451029)) 
There were no significant differences between the safety profile of abrocitinib as monotherapy or in 
combination with topical medicated therapy in terms of frequent events, serious and severe events, or 
AEs leading to discontinuation. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were 3 deaths as of a cut-off date of 22 April 2020. One during the treatment period and 1 
during the follow-up period. Another death was reported 8 months after discontinuation from study. All 
3 deaths were in abrocitinib-treated subjects.  
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 150/216 
 
 
 
 
• 
The first case concerned a 73-year-old female with an SAE of sudden death on study Day 107, 
occurring 22 days after discontinuation of study drug abrocitinib 100 mg QD. The subject had a history 
of aortic sclerosis and calcification as observed in a chest X-ray performed during screening and a 
history of untreated hypertension. No autopsy was performed, and the sudden death event was 
adjudicated as a CV death. The event was assessed as not related to study drug per the investigator. 
• 
The second case was a 69-year-old female. She received abrocitinib 200 mg QD. The subject 
tested positive for COVID-19 infection on study Day 84 and was hospitalised. The subject died on 
study Day 107. The investigator considered the event to be unrelated to study drug. 
• 
The third case concerned a 78 -year old female that experienced an SAE of Adenocarcinoma 
Gastric on study Day 22, she received abrocitinib 200 mg QD. Prior to enrolment, the subject 
experienced pain and discomfort under the ribs. On study Day 43, the subject had unclear dyspeptic 
problems and excessive bloating. On the same day (study Day 43), a CT scan showed carcinomatosis 
with multifocal hepatic metastases. This subject SAE was assessed as not related to treatment as per 
PI judgment. The action taken in response to the event for the study drug was withdrawn 
permanently. A follow-up SAE report was received on 09 March 2020 that stated that the subject died 
approximately 7 months after discontinuation from study participation due to gastric adenocarcinoma 
(14 August 2019). 
The three described fatal cases of different diagnoses are considered unlikely to be related to the study 
drug.   
Other Serious Adverse Events 
The incidence of SAEs was similar across the abrocitinib and placebo groups.

The Infections and infestations SOC had the highest incidence of SAEs. SAEs of pneumonia (3 subjects, 
0.3%), asthma (3 subjects, 0.3%), and dermatitis atopic (2 subjects, 0.2%) occurred in more than 1 
abrocitinib treated subject; all other SAEs occurred in 1 subject. All subjects with asthma were 
considered not related by investigators as all subjects had a history of asthma. One led to study 
discontinuation. There seems to be no dose related increase of SAEs. It is noted though that all three 
serious cases of pneumonia were only reported for subjects in the abrocitinib treated group.  
Long-term treatment

Specific SAEs 
There were 6 subjects with an SAE of asthma and 1 with an SAE of status asthmaticus. All SAEs of 
asthma were resolved (all but 1 without sequelae), drug withdrawn in 2 subjects and interrupted in 1 
subject. Asthma was a common comorbidity in the population, being reported as ongoing in more than 
30% of subjects according to the applicant. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with a significantly 
higher risk of asthma as well as other conditions of allergic atopy e.g. allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Case 
histories of five asthma events whereof one case of Status Asthmaticus have been presented.

Risk Contextualisation 
The applicant followed a method of risk contextualisation that relies on rates of adverse events 
observed in external real-world observational databases. A uniform protocol was executed in which 2 
external databases were used to assess the rates of safety events of interest for abrocitinib in patients 
with moderate to severe AD. Analyses were conducted in the following external clinical practice 
databases: KPNC (US) and THIN (UK) and a population based cohort study using data from the Danish 
registries to evaluate IRs of VTE (DK). 
Serious Infections including opportunistic infections 
Infections have been associated with other JAK inhibitors. 
The proportion of subjects reporting serious infections was low (<2%) in each treatment arm 
(including placebo) and there was no dose response. Pneumonia, herpes zoster, and herpes simplex 
were the most frequent serious infections across all abrocitinib-exposed subjects. 
In the placebo-controlled studies with abrocitinib, the IR for serious infection was lower in the 
abrocitinib 200 mg QD treatment group (2 subjects, 1.28/100 PY [95% CI: 0.16, 4.62]) compared to 
the placebo (2 subjects, 2.31/100 PY [95% CI: 0.28, 8.33]) and abrocitinib 100 mg QD treatment 
groups (6 subjects, 3.80/100 PY [95% CI: 1.39, 8.27]). These IRs were relatively comparable to 
background rates for serious infection in adults with AD (2.14/100 PY [95% CI: 2.10-2.18]) and for 
serious and severe events in the placebo group of randomised-controlled studies in AD (3.978/100 PY) 
(Narla et al, 2018; Eichenfield et al, 2019). However, the IRs above, for both placebo and abrocitinib 
treated subjects, were higher than those in the matched cohort studies. 
Per protocol, subjects with serious infection were to discontinue treatment; approximately 90% of 
serious infections resolved during analysis period. There was 1 fatal infection after hospitalisation for 
COVID-19. 
There were 10 subjects with adjudicated opportunistic infections, all were events of cutaneous multi-
dermatomal herpes zoster [0.60/100 PY (95% CI: 0.29, 1.10)]. Among these events, 2 were serious, 
treated with IV antivirals. The non-serious events were treated with oral antivirals or did not require 
therapy, and most resolved with no change or interruption to study drug. There were no events of 
opportunistic infection that were bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, or protozoan infections.

Infections – All Exposure Pool 
Herpes zoster 
Herpes Zoster is an identified risk of treatment with JAK inhibitors (Winthrop et al, 2017). There was a 
higher incidence of herpes zoster (2.04/100 PY [95% CI: 1.09, 3.49] for 100 mg QD and 4.34/100 PY 
[95% CI: 3.15, 5.82] for 200 mg QD) (Table 12), including ophthalmic herpes zoster (4 subjects), in 
the abrocitinib-treated subjects compared to placebo as well as a dose response across the abrocitinib 
groups; across all abrocitinib-treated subjects the proportion of subjects with serious events of herpes 
zoster were uncommon (<0.2% for each). Herpes zoster events generally resolved without 
discontinuation of abrocitinib. The incidence rate of herpes zoster in patients ≥65 years of age treated 
with abrocitinib (7.40/100 PY) was higher that of patients 18 to <65 years of age (3.29/100 PY) and 
12 to <18 years of age (2.12/100 PY). 
Eczema herpeticum 
There was no dose-related increase in the IR for eczema herpeticum (including events of Kaposi’s 
varicelliform eruption) and no excess over placebo in the Primary Safety Pool (IR=3.46 (0.71, 10.12. 
In the All Exposure Pool the IR in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group was lower than that in the 100 mg 
QD group although there were few events and, as such, the confidence intervals were relatively wide 
(IR 200 mg=0.78 [0.34, 1.53] and IR 100 mg = 2.34 [1.31, 3.86]). Among these events, there were 4 
serious events all in the 100 mg QD group. Among all events of eczema herpeticum 91.7% of events 
resolved within the analysis period, 5 events led to study discontinuation (100 mg group: 4 subjects, 
0.5%; 200 mg group: 1 subject, 0.1%). Among all events, 18 of 23 events were confirmed as an 
event of eczema herpeticum through adjudication

Cautions concerning viral activation, screening for tuberculosis and screening for viral hepatitis are 
addressed in the SmPC section 4.4. The risk of serious infections is addressed in sections 4.4 and 4.8 
and in Table 2 of section 4.8. Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster including zoster ophthalmicus are 
inserted with frequency uncommon and common respectively, however, following the review process 
revised to frequency common for both. A clarification was needed if the cases reported as opportunistic 
infections have been included in the calculation of frequency of herpes zoster. It is stated in section 4.4 
of the proposed SmPC that the most frequent serious infections in clinical studies were herpes simplex, 
herpes zoster, and pneumonia with a reference to section 4.8 and that the risks and benefits of 
treatment with abrocitinib should be carefully considered prior to initiating in patients and patients to 
be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection. There seems to be no 
case of tuberculosis reported. Upon request from the CHMP and in view of the above and the important 
potential risk of serious infections the applicant agreed to add active serious systemic infections 
including TB as contraindication. Three cases of pneumonia occurred in the abrocitinib treated group 
although only one seem to have been classified as serious. Pneumonia is a recognised infection 
associated with use of other JAK inhibitors. Upon request from the CHMP, pneumonia was added in 
table 2 of the SmPC in section 4.8 with a frequency uncommon.   
Malignancies except NMSC 
There were 4 events of potential malignancy (2 events of prostate cancer and 2 events of ovarian 
neoplasm) in the clinical database at the time of release, adjudication was incomplete for these events. 
As such, the IR for all 4 events (0.24/100 PY [95% CI: 0.07, 0.61]) was assessed. Although 
adjudication was not complete for 3 of the events, 1 of the events of ovarian neoplasm was 
adjudicated as not malignant. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) 
Across all subjects treated with abrocitinib, there were 7 adjudicated cases of non-melanoma skin 
cancer [0.42/100 PY (95% CI: 0.17, 0.86)], 3 subjects in the abrocitinib 100 mg QD group and 4 
subjects in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group. 
Comparisons were made with data from KPNC (Kaiser Permanente) and THIN databases. Overall, the 
IRs for malignancies (excluding NMSC) and NMSC in the KPNC and THIN databases were comparable 
to those seen in the AD clinical programme. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
There were 3 adjudicated MACE events [IR 0.18/100 PY (95% CI: 0.04, 0.52)], 2 events of myocardial 
infarction in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group and 1 event of sudden death in the abrocitinib 100 mg 
QD group. All events occurred in subjects older than 60 years with pre-existing CV risk factors. In the 
opinion of the Investigators, the events were considered to be unrelated to the study drug. There were 
no MACE events among adolescents.  
In the All Exposure Pool, 1 subject in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group had a QTcF of >500 msec, and 
5 subjects in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group had a change from screening >60 msec. None of these 
5 subjects had a QTcF >462 msec. 
A thorough QT study indicated a concentration dependent effect judged to have a lack of a clinically 
relevant effect on QTc interval (see section on secondary pharmacology). In the phase 3 studies, there 
were exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to QT duration. In addition, ECGs were monitored at 
2-4 week intervals. In the Primary Pool, no subjects in any treatment group had a QTcF of >500 msec. 
One (1) subject in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group had a change from screening >60 msec, with a 
screening value of 383 msec that increased to 452 msec (i.e., a change from screening of 69 msec). 
The subject’s Day 1 QTcF was 452 msec and, as such, the change from baseline was 0. In the All

Exposure Pool, 1 subject in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group had a QTcF of >500 msec, and 5 subjects 
in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group had a change from screening >60 msec. None of these 5 subjects 
had a QTcF >462 msec. As all changes are described in the 200 mg QD a dose dependent effect seems 
likely and the applicant was requested to discuss the relevance of cautionary measures in the SmPC 
(see discussion section on clinical safety).  
Overall, the IRs for MACE events in the KPNC (Kaiser Permanente) database were comparable to those 
seen in the AD clinical programme. 
Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) 
There were 2 adjudicated events of deep venous thrombosis (0.12/100 PY [95% CI: 0.01, 0.43]), all in 
the 200 mg QD group. 
The first case concerned a 44-year-old female randomised to abrocitinib 200mg QD from 29 January 
2019. The last dose of study drug was taken on 09 September 2019. On 12 September 2019 the 
subject underwent arthroscopic knee surgery under spinal anaesthesia. The subject received bemiparin 
sodium for 5 days as prophylaxis for thrombosis. On 17 September 2019 an ultrasound of the veins 
showed thrombosis of fibular veins and muscle branches. The study drug was permanently 
discontinued in response to the event of calf thrombosis. In the opinion of the Investigator, the event 
of calf thrombosis was considered to be unrelated to the study drug, concomitant medications, or a 
clinical trial procedure. The event was reported as related to arthroscopic surgery. The study Sponsor 
concurred with the Investigator’s causality assessment. 
The second case was a 50-year-old female. The subject received abrocitinib 200mg QD from 14 June 
2019 to 06 September 2019. The subject experienced a non-serious adverse event of special interest 
of thrombophlebitis superficial on 31 July 2019 (Study Day 48). No action was taken with the study 
drug in response to the event of superficial thrombophlebitis. In the opinion of the Investigator, the 
event of superficial thrombophlebitis was considered to be not related to the study drug, but it was 
related to the history of a hypertension. 
The IRs for DVT events in the KPNC database were lower than those seen in the AD clinical 
programme. 
Pulmonary embolism (PE) 
Across all subjects treated with abrocitinib, there were 3 adjudicated events of PE (0.18/100 PY [95% 
CI: 0.04, 0.52]).  
One case concerned a 55-year old man who following approximately 2½ months of treatment with 
abrocitinib 200 mg once daily (QD) was reported with a serious adverse event (SAE), ‘pulmonary 
embolism’ with seriousness criteria of Important Medical Event. The study drug (abrocitinib) was 
permanently discontinued due to the event of PE with last dose received on 22 October 2016 (study 
Day 80). On 05 January 2017 (study Day 155), the subject had a follow-up appointment with his 
specialist for the result of a lung nuclear scan which was negative for blood clots. He was considered 
recovered from PE with sequelae on 05 January 2017. 
The second case was a 69-year-old female who received study treatment abrocitinib 200mg QD for a 
bit more that 2½ months and experienced a serious adverse event of PE (bilateral pulmonary emboli). 
The Investigator considered the event of PE to be moderate in severity. The patient underwent cardiac 
computed tomography/angiography and chest x-ray, which confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral PE. The 
event of PE was considered resolved approx. 3 weeks later. The study drug was permanently 
discontinued. The concomitant medication estradiol was also permanently withdrawn as the physician 
suspected it to be the cause of the event.

EMA/647846/2021

The third case concerned a 17-year-old male who had class III obesity with a family history of PE and 
venous thromboembolism (VTE). He received study drug abrocitinib 200mg QD and experienced 
serious adverse events of PE on study Day 565, pneumothorax on study Day 574), and acute kidney 
injury on study Day 578. The study drug was permanently discontinued in response to the event of 
pneumothorax. The study Sponsor did not consider the event of acute PE related to the study drug but 
in the opinion of the Investigator, the event of PE was considered to be related to the study drug. 
The IRs for PE events in the KPNC database were lower than those seen in the AD clinical programme. 
The risk of venous thromboembolism is addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC such that events of deep 
venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving 
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. It is also included in Table 1 of section 4.8 as uncommon. 
Other Adverse events of interest. 
Hypersensitivity 
Primary Safety Pool 
The proportion of subjects with hypersensitivity events was similar across the treatment groups. 
Among these events, 2 subjects in the placebo group (anaphylactic reaction, dermatitis exfoliative) and 
1 subject in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group (anaphylactic shock) had serious events. The event in 
the abrocitinib-treated subject was related to food allergy.

subject experienced anaphylactic shock with feeling sick, generalised rash, low blood pressure and 
collapse with fast recovery after IV adrenaline administration. The event was considered not related to 
study drug by the investigator, but to probably allergy. The subject remained in the study without 
change to study drug and the event was resolved on Day 81.

other JAK inhibitors. There are together seven cases of either swelling of eyes, swelling of eyelids, 
oedema of eyelids and oedema of eye reported for the abrocitinib treated subjects in the primary 
safety pool and only one case of eyelid swelling in the placebo group. In the All safety pool there are in 
total 13 cases of eye reactions, this includes the previous terms as well as conjunctival oedema and 
eye allergy.

Gastrointestinal (GI) 
The GI perforation events were all upper GI events. There were 3 subjects (0.1%) reporting GI 
perforation in the All Exposure pool, 2 subjects (0.2%) in the abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 1 subject 
(0.1%) in the 200 mg QD group. The IR was 0.18/100 PY. Among these events, 1 was serious and led 
to study discontinuation.  
Weight 
Changes in weight are described using BMI to account for difference in age and gender. In the Primary 
Pool, the baseline median BMI was comparable in the placebo (25 kg/m2), the abrocitinib 100 mg and 
200 mg QD groups (26 and 25 kg/m2, respectively). At week 12, there was no meaningful median 
change in the placebo (0 kg/m2), the abrocitinib 100 mg and 200 mg QD groups (0 and 1 kg/m2, 
respectively). 
In the All Exposure Pool, the baseline median BMI was the same in the 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD 
treatment groups (25 kg/m2). There was no meaningful median change through Month 15 (27 kg/m2) 
for the 100 mg QD group; the median increased to 32 kg/m2 at Month 21. There was no meaningful 
median change for the 200 mg QD group (25 kg/m2 at Month 18 and Month 21).

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematological Laboratory Changes 
Changes in haematology laboratory parameters were consistent with the mechanism of action, the 
non-clinical data, and suggest specificity of abrocitinib inhibiting the signalling of cytokines that use 
JAK1 heterodimers and sparing the JAK2 homo and heterodimer signalling cytokines given the clinically 
relevant changes in neutrophil counts and haemoglobin in the clinical studies. Changes in platelets 
after initiation of JAK inhibitors are likely to be the result of a balance between JAK2 mediated 
inhibition of thrombopoietin inhibition, decreasing platelet production, signalling and decreased IL-6 
driven thrombopoietin hepatic production. These interactions are complex and, consequently, effects 
on platelets have been inconsistent across the class. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is used to treat

EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 163/216 
 
 
 
 
post-polycythemia vera and has been associated with thrombocytopenia, while thrombocytosis has 
been associated with baricitinib treatment. A JAK1 inhibitor that preserves selectivity in the clinic has 
the potential to decrease platelet production by decreasing hepatic TPO synthesis resulting from IL-6 
signalling (including rheumatoid arthritis). In fact, IL-6 inhibition with the monoclonal antibody 
tocilizumab is associated with a decrease in platelet counts (ACTEMRA prescribing information, 2013). 
Haemoglobin changes with JAK inhibition have been thought to be due to inhibition of erythropoietin 
signalling through JAK2 homodimers. A JAK1 inhibitor that preserves selectivity in the clinic is not 
expected to produce significant haemoglobin decreases in a large percentage of patients and such 
changes were not seen with abrocitinib. 
Lymphocyte decreases are thought to result from a complex set of interactions resulting from the 
inhibition of certain cytokines (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15) and since signalling of these is mediated by JAK1-
containing signalling complexes (ie JAK1-JAK3), these are expected to be observed with a JAK1 
selective inhibitor. 
Neutrophil decreases have been linked to inhibition of G- and/or GM-CSF signalling that are mediated 
through JAK2 homodimers and/or resolution of inflammation. A JAK1 inhibitor that preserves 
selectivity in the clinic is not expected to produce clinically significant neutropenia in a large 
percentage of patients. 
The results observed in the development programme for abrocitinib suggest that the biochemical JAK1 
selectivity persists after administration of clinically efficacious doses in most patients: 
Haemoglobin and neutrophils 
•  No population changes in haemoglobin and/or neutrophils are observed. 
•  Very few patients develop clinically meaningful low values of haemoglobin and no patient had 
a confirmed neutrophil count less than 1.0×103/mm3. 
•  Although there are differences across JAK inhibitors with regard to the effect or extent of 
effect with regard to haematologic parameters, prescribing information for JAK inhibitors used 
for rheumatoid arthritis generally include the recommendation that they should not be 
initiated in patients with an ALC <0.5×103/mm3, ANC <1×103/mm3 and Hgb <8 gm/dL.

There was one SAE of pancytopenia and 2 AEs of pancytopenia exposed to abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 
200 mg QD respectively reported in the All Exposure pool. All three patients discontinued the study 
although one did not meet the discontinuation criteria. 
Platelets 
After initiation of abrocitinib, there was a dose-related decrease in platelets with a nadir in median 
values at week 4; most values remained above the LLN (140×103/mm3). The median platelet counts 
in the population increased and reached a plateau at week 12 that was below the original baseline. 
Across all subjects treated with abrocitinib, more than 95% of subjects in all treatment groups 
maintained a platelet value greater than 100×103/mm3 throughout the treatment period. There were 9 
subjects (0.3%) with a confirmed platelet values of <75×103/mm3, all values between week 2 and 
week 4 of exposure. Among the 9 subjects with low platelet counts, 2 (0.1%) subjects met the pre-

specified Phase 3 discontinuation criteria (confirmed <50×103/mm3), both were in the abrocitinib 200 
mg QD treatment group. Neither of these subjects had an AE related to bleeding.

Lymphocytes 
In the Primary Pool, approximately 80% subjects in the abrocitinib treated groups maintained an ALC ≥
1×103/mm3. A higher percentage of subjects in the abrocitinib 100 mg (18.5%) and abrocitinib 200 
mg (20.8%) QD groups had an ALC <1×103/mm3 compared with the placebo group (11.9%). There 
was no change over time in absolute lymphocyte counts associated with abrocitinib treatment. 
Per protocol, subjects included in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies with abrocitinib, had lymphocyte counts 
at screening within the reference range in order to meet inclusion criteria. There were 4 subjects 
meeting discontinuation criteria for lymphopenia (confirmed <0.5×103/mm3). These subjects were all 
older than 65 years of age and in 3 of the 4 subjects the confirmed decrease occurred in the first few 
weeks of therapy.

In summary, the clinical data are sufficient to determine that lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia are 
ADRs. Although there was no change over time in absolute lymphocyte counts associated with 
abrocitinib treatment, a higher percentage of subjects in the abrocitinib 100 mg (18.5%) and 
abrocitinib 200 mg (20.8%) QD groups had an ALC <1×103/mm3 compared with the placebo group 
(11.9%) and 4 subjects met discontinuation criteria for lymphopenia (confirmed <0.5×103/mm3). 
Thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia are labelled in Table 1 of section 4.8. No clear population changes 
in neutrophils were observed in the treatment groups of abrocitinib and no patient had a confirmed 
neutrophil count less than 1.0×103/mm3. However, although no patient exposed to abrocitinib in the 
clinical studies experienced ANC 1.0 x103/mm3 there was a dose-response effect in the number of 
subjects with ANC below 2 x103/mm3. In addition, pancytopenia was one of the AEs leading to 
discontinuation that occurred in more than 2 subjects. Although there were no population changes in 
haemoglobin a limited number of patients developed clinically meaningful low values of haemoglobin. 
The proposed precautionary prescribing information for abrocitinib in section 4.2 as well as 4.4 is 
endorsed. The proposed text in section 4.2 presently reads: Treatment with abrocitinib should not be 
initiated in patients with a platelet count < 150 × 103/mm3, an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < 0.5 
× 103/mm3, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1 × 103/mm3 or who have a haemoglobin value < 8 
g/dL (see section 4.4). 
Lipids 
Changes in Lipid Parameters 
In the Primary Pool, there was a dose-related percent change increase in LDL-c relative to placebo at 
week 4, which remained through the final visit in the treatment period (week 12 /week 16, Figure 17). 
The median change from baseline to last observation was higher in the abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 
mg QD group (5 and 7 mg/dL, respectively) relative to placebo (-2 mg/dL). The percent change in 
LDL-c cholesterol at week 16 (B7451029) is higher for the abrocitinib and placebo arms than that of 
the other studies at week 12 (B7451012, B7451013, B7451006); however, the relationship between 
the arms remains similar. 
In the All Exposure Pool, there was a continued increase in LDL though Month 9 (n = 617), afterwards 
there was more limited data. At Month 9 the median LDL was 114.0 mg/dL in the abrocitinib 100 mg 
QD group and 108.0 mg/dL in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group. 
Total cholesterol changes over time were consistent with that of LDL-c. In the All Exposure Pool, the 
LDL/HDL ratio decreases initially over the first 3 months and then increases by 5-10%, however, the 
number of subjects after Month 9 is more limited and, as such, there is less precision in the estimates. 
There was a dose-related percent change increase in HDL-c relative to placebo at week 4 which 
remained through the final visit in the treatment period (week 12 for studies B7451006, B7451012, 
B7451013 and week 16 for B7451029). The percent increase in HDL is larger than LDL. In the All 
Exposure Pool, the HDL remained above baseline throughout the analysis period.

There was no meaningful change in triglycerides relative to placebo. 
In the proposed SmPC section 4.4 it is initially stated that Dose dependent increase in blood lipid 
parameters were reported in patients treated with abrocitinib (see section 4.8). Lipid parameters 
should be assessed approximately 4 weeks following initiation of abrocitinib therapy and thereafter 
patients should be managed according to clinical guidelines for hyperlipidaemia. The effect of these 
lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

This recommendation is in line with other JAK 1 inhibitors though the time point of first recommended 
lipid assessment following initiation of therapy is earlier, 4 weeks. This is assumed to be linked to the 
shown dose-related percent change increase in LDL-c relative to placebo at week 4, which remained 
through week 12. Upon request from the CHMP, further information in relation to the known 
cardiovascular risk associated with hyperlipidaemia was included (see discussion section on clinical 
safety). 
Creatine Kinase (CK) 
Treatment with other JAK inhibitors has been associated with increases in CK. As such, CK was 
monitored in the abrocitinib programme. There was a dose-related increase in CK beginning at week 4 
and having at plateau at week 8 (Figure 28). The median change at the last observation was increased 
in the abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD groups (53 U/L and 88 U/L, respectively) relative to the 
placebo group (-2 U/L). There was a dose-related increase in subjects reporting AEs of blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased in the Primary Pool. In the All Exposure Pool, CK remains increased 
throughout the study period and 5.4% of abrocitinib-treated subjects with CK >5xULN. There were no 
reported events of rhabdomyolysis.

There were 2 subjects with an SAE of myositis.  
Creatine phosphokinase elevations increased is labelled in SmPC section 4.8 in SOC Investigations with 
frequency common. Upon request from the CHMP, the increase was specified as: Creatine 
phosphokinase increased > 5 x ULN.  
Serum creatinine 
There was no difference in the change over time of creatinine between the abrocitinib dose groups and 
the placebo group over 12 weeks. In the Primary Pool, the incidence was similar in abrocitinib 
treatment groups and the placebo group

CRP 
There was a decrease over time in CRP in the abrocitinib treatment groups compared to placebo. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Safety in adolescents (12 - <18 years) 
Short-term treatment 
In the Primary safety pool, the safety profile for the TEAE overview (e.g., All AEs, SAEs, severe events, 
AEs leading to discontinuation) was generally similar across the subgroups.  
Please refer to tables presented in the previous section summarising the TEAEs reported in adolescents 
of the Primary safety pool.  
Long-term treatment 
In the All Exposure Pool, 364 adolescent subjects were exposed representing 230.3 patient years. The 
median age of the adolescent subgroup was 15.0 years. In the All Exposure Pool, adolescent subjects 
were more likely to have any AE relative to the 18 - <65-year-old subgroup. There was no clustering 
of AEs driving the difference and, as such, the overall AE profile was similar. The proportions of 
adolescent subjects having serious and severe events as well as events leading to discontinuations 
were similar to those for subjects in the 18 - <65-year-old subgroup. In the All Exposure Pool, there 
were no meaningful differences in the proportions of adolescent subjects having serious infection 
relative to the other age groups. The IR for all herpes zoster infections was lowest in the adolescent 
subgroup relative to the other age groups.

Bone and Growth  
Based on non-clinical data, monitoring was implemented and the potential growth effect risk to 
adolescents was analysed for height velocity SDS as well as AEs of fracture and growth disturbance in 
adolescents. Seenon-clinical assessment for further data. Height SDS was examined in adolescent 
subjects who entered the long-term safety study (B7451015).

Deviation Score (SDS) for Height Measurement and Its Change from Baseline

Height SDS: The SDS standardised to the US population by age and gender was calculated at each 
time point where height measurement is available. As such the findings are normalised across age and 
gender. At Month 6 and Month 12, the SDS changes ranged from -0.9 to 1.3 with median of 0, 
suggesting no meaningful change in the subjects' growth curves. There were overall no events related 
to growth disturbance in the All Exposure Pool. It was considered that there was no meaningful change 
in measures of central tendency for height velocity SDS. 
Abrocitinib seemed to be well-tolerated in the adolescent population when analysing submitted data. 
However, there was a higher percentage of TEAEs in adolescents compared to the total population in 
the analysis of the primary safety pool and higher compared to the 18 to <65 years age group of the 
All Safety Pool and it is questioned if provided clinical data are sufficient to address any potential bone 
effects in adolescents, in line with the signal indicated in pre-clinical studies. Based on this and the 
assumption of dose dependent TEAES, further discussion of safety were requested in relation to 
abrocitinib exposure in adolescents. Furthermore, as noted previously the discrepancy and increase of 
percentage of reported TEAEs within the SOC “Respiratory, Thoracic And Mediastinal Disorders” of 
abrocitinib treated subjects < 18 years of age compared to the total population was addressed upon 
request from the CHMP. 
Safety in elderly (≥65 years) 
Older subjects were more likely to discontinue treatment due to an AE relative to the younger age 
subgroups; the most frequent of these AEs were in the Investigations and Skin and subcutaneous 
structures SOCs. Older subjects were more likely to have herpes zoster, but not serious infections. 
Most subjects with CV and malignancy events were >60 years of age. Among patients exposed to 
abrocitinib including the long-term extension study, confirmed absolute lymphocyte count <0.5 × 
103/mm3 occurred only in patients ≥65 years of age. A higher proportion of patients ≥65 years of age

had platelets <75 × 103/mm3.Most subjects meeting discontinuation criteria for haematology labs were 
≥65 years of age.

It is stated in SmPC section 4.4 that the rate of herpes zoster infections was higher in patients 65 
years of age and older with a cross reference to section 4.8. Most subjects meeting discontinuation 
criteria for haematology labs were also ≥65 years of age, seemingly absolute lymphocyte counts <0.5

× 103/mm3 occurred only in patients ≥65 years of age and a higher proportion of patients ≥65 years 
of age had platelets <75 × 103/mm3. Furthermore, according to Table 65 the percentage of subjects 
with SAEs exposed to combined strengths of 100mg QD abrocitinib and 200 mg QD abrocitinib were 
3.8%, 10.3% and 16 % for individuals 18-≥65 years of age, >65 years of age and >75 years of age 
respectively. Based on these safety findings, the applicant was requested to further justify the 
exposure and dosing recommendations of abrocitinib in this subgroup.  
Race 
The number of subjects in the ‘Other’ subgroup was low and analyses in that subgroup had limited 
precision. As such, this section focuses on the White, Black, and Asian subgroups.

As TEAEs when treated with abrocitinib 200 mg were more frequent in the Asian subgroup (80.1 %) 
compared to the Black subgroup (66.9%) and White subgroup (70.3 %) this will need further 
discussion concerning The applicant should comment and justify why no further any actions from the 
perspective of labelling concerning the Asian subgroup. 
Hepatic 
Transaminases 
More than 80% of abrocitinib-treated subjects maintained AST and ALT within the normal range 
throughout the study period. The proportion of subjects with AST and/or ALT >3xULN was low 
(≤1.1%) and similar across the treatment groups. In total, 24 hepatic cases were adjudicated to 
determine the likelihood of a DILI case. Most (n = 17) cases were adjudicated as unlikely or unrelated. 
The other 7 were adjudicated as a possible DILI (probability 25-50%). No cases were adjudicated as a 
probable, highly likely, or definite DILI case. No subject met Hy’s law criteria. 
There were 2 SAEs of Drug-induced liver injury. One completed the adjudication process and the final 
assessment determined that DILI was unlikely. One event had not completed the adjudication process 
at the time of database release. The information proposed for the SmPC relates only to hepatic 
impairment and dose adjustments not being required in patients with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate 
(Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment and that abrocitinib has not been studied in patients with severe 
(Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment and therefore is contraindicated. There is no labelling in SmPC 
section 4.8. This is presently accepted though it is proposed that DILI is added in the safety 
specification of the RMP as important potential risk. 
Renal 
Baseline eGFR 
Overall, the abrocitinib was safe and well tolerated regardless of baseline eGFR. No unique risks were 
identified based on baseline eGFR. There were 42 subjects (26.4 PY) in the eGFR <60 mL/min 
subgroup, 756(413.5 PY) in the 60 - <90 mL/min subgroup and 2053 (1172 PY) in the eGFR ≥90 
mL/min subgroup. Subjects in the <60 mL/min subgroup were more likely to be in the age ≥65 years 
and female subgroups and had a lower weight. Subjects in the ≥90 mL/min subgroup had a higher 
proportion of subjects with severe disease. There was no meaningful difference in the proportions of 
subjects having all TEAEs, SAEs, severe AEs, and AEs (all causalities, all safety pool) leading to 
discontinuation in the eGFR subgroups. There was no meaningful difference in the IR for serious 
infection or herpes zoster by baseline eGFR subgroup.  
Based on the recommendations in section 4.2 of the SmPC relating to dose reductions in patients with 
RI, the applicant was asked to clarify how many of the total number of 42 subjects (26.4 PY) in the 
eGFR <60 mL/min subgroup received 50mg QD and 100 mg QD abrocitinib respectively; and how 
many of these subjects experienced adverse events in each dosing group.  
Treatment with other JAK inhibitors has been associated with increases in creatinine. Creatinine was 
monitored in the abrocitinib programme. Phase 3 protocols included a pre-specified discontinuation 
criterion of 2 sequential increases in serum creatinine that are >50% over the average of screening 
and baseline values and an absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥0.5 mg/dL. In the Primary Pool, 
Assessment report - Cibinqo

there was no meaningful change in creatinine over time in any treatment group. No subject met 
protocol pre-specified discontinuation criteria. 
There was 1 event of acute kidney injury in the abrocitinib 100 mg QD group; the event was 
considered by the investigator as not related to the study drug. This event was not serious, severe, 
and did not lead to discontinuation. In the All Exposure Pool, there were 2 events of blood creatinine 
abnormal and 3 events of blood creatinine increased in abrocitinib-treated subjects. There were 3 
events of acute kidney injury. One event of acute kidney injury was serious and concerned a 17-year 
old male who had serious events of pulmonary embolism and pneumothorax leading to discontinuation 
of therapy followed 5 days later by acute kidney injury. In this case there were concomitant 
medications vancomycin and piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium that were permanently withdrawn 
in response to the event of acute kidney injury. In the opinion of the Investigator, the event of acute 
kidney injury was considered to be unrelated to the study drug or a clinical trial procedure but was 
related to concomitant medications vancomycin and piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium. The study 
Sponsor concurred with the Investigator’s causality assessment. There was 1 event of blood creatinine 
increased severe; 1 event of acute kidney injury and 1 event of blood creatinine increased led to 
discontinuation.   
Pregnancy 
Adverse effects on the musculoskeletal system (skeletal variation at ≥30 mg/kg/day) were observed in 
the embryo-foetal development study in rats. In the EFD study in rats, the developmental NOAEL was 
established at exposures of 2.4x the unbound human AUC at the clinical dose of 200 mg. In a rat PPND 
study, no effects on parturition and postnatal development were noted at NOAEL exposures of 2.4x the 
unbound human AUC. In the abrocitinib AD studies, based on the nonclinical data briefly described 
above, women of childbearing potential were expected to use effective contraception. While there are 
no substantial data on the use of abrocitinib in pregnant women, as of 22 April 2020, there have been 
10 cases of exposure in utero reported in subjects exposed to abrocitinib in the AD clinical programme, 
7 maternal exposures and 3 partner exposures. Of the 7 maternal exposers there were two 
miscarriages and five with outcome unknown.  
In summary, there is very limited clinical pregnancy data. According to the proposed SmPC in section 
4.3 abrocitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy and breast feeding and in section 4.6 it is 
recommended that women of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception 
during treatment and for 1 month following the final dose of abrocitinib.  
See non-clinical assessment for evaluation of effects on pregnancy and fertility. For other JAK 
inhibitors, treatment is contraindicated during pregnancy. Upon request from the CHMP and based on 
the non-clinical data and assessment, the applicant agreed to add pregnancy and breast-feeding as a 
contraindication for treatment with abrocitinib. 
Lactation 
There are no data on the presence of abrocitinib in human milk, the effects on the breast-fed infant, or 
the effects on milk production. Abrocitinib was secreted in milk of lactating rats. A risk to 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded and abrocitinib should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Therefore, abrocitinib is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3 in the SmPC). 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
No data on immunological events were reported for AD patients exposed to abrocitinib. Abrocitinib is a 
small molecule product and antibody formation related to monoclonal antibody products is not 
relevant.

2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions studies 
Based on the results of the extrinsic factor studies, abrocitinib dose should be reduced by half to 50 mg 
or 100 mg once daily in patients receiving strong inhibitors of CYP2C19 alone (eg, fluvoxamine and 
ticlodipine) and in patients receiving one or more concomitant medicinal products that result in both 
moderate inhibition of CYP2C9 as well as strong inhibition of CYP2C19 (eg, fluconazole). The use of 
abrocitinib is not recommended concomitantly with moderate or strong inducers of CYP2C19/2C9 
enzymes (eg, rifampin). Please also refer to the clinical pharmacology part of this report. 
Overdose 
Abrocitinib has been administered in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in doses as high as 800 mg in a 
single dose to healthy subjects (Study B7451001) and 200 mg BID and 400 mg QD for 4 weeks to 
subjects with psoriasis (Study B7451005).  
Single doses of 800 mg (n = 16) were well tolerated in study B7451001. The most common AEs in that 
treatment group (reported in ≥3 subjects) were flatulence (n = 3), nausea (n = 3), vomiting (n = 4), 
pain in extremities (n = 3), and headache (n = 4). In the phase 2 study B7451005, subjects with 
psoriasis were treated with abrocitinib 200 mg BID and 400 mg QD for 4 weeks. Abrocitinib was 
generally well tolerated at those higher doses (Study B7451005). In this psoriasis Phase 2 study, the 
platelet counts for abrocitinib 400 mg QD and 200 mg QD were similar. The abrocitinib 200 mg QD 
dose group had platelet decreases in weeks 1-4 that were lower than that of 200 mg BID dose. There 
were no adverse events of overdose in the clinical programme. 
Drug Abuse 
There were no reports of drug abuse or dependence or other information relevant to the potential for 
drug abuse in these studies. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
In the completed studies in the All Exposure Pool (B7451006, B7451012, B7451013, B7451029), no 
safety signal was identified in subjects who entered a follow-up period due to discontinuation from the 
study. In the All Exposure Pool, there were no AEs related to withdrawal and rebound. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability  
There were no reports of impairment of the senses, coordination, or other factors that would result in 
diminished ability to drive a vehicle or operate machinery or would impair mental ability. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The primary safety pool 
The proportion of subjects with AEs leading to discontinuations was similar across the abrocitinib 
treatment groups and the placebo group, with no dose relationship observed. The most frequent AEs 
leading to discontinuation were dermatitis atopic, occurring more frequently in the placebo treatment 
group (5.6%) than in abrocitinib treated subjects (1.2%). Other frequent AEs leading to 
discontinuation, occurring more frequently in the abrocitinib treated subjects, were nausea (4 of 1198 
subjects: 0.3%) and headache (3 of 1198 subjects: 0.3%). 
The proportion of subjects with temporary discontinuations was similar across treatment groups. The 
SOCs with the highest proportion of temporary discontinuations were Gastrointestinal disorders and 
Infections and infestations.

In the All Exposure Pool, the proportion of subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation was similar 
across the abrocitinib treatment groups with no dose relationship observed. the discontinuations 
accumulated in a linear fashion over time with a slightly steeper curve in the 200 mg QD group. 
Discontinuations occurred more frequently in older subjects (≥65 years) compared to the other age 
subgroups. The proportion of subjects with temporary discontinuations was similar across treatment 
groups. The SOCs with the highest proportion of temporary discontinuations were Infections and 
infestations, Investigations, and Gastrointestinal disorders.

There is no post-marketing data for abrocitinib.  
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Data from eight phase 2 and phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis (AD) are included in the safety 
analysis of the initial submission. A total of 2856 subjects with AD were exposed to abrocitinib during 
the development programme. Among these subjects 885 were exposed to 100 mg QD and 1971 to 200 
mg QD. Following a safety update as of April 2021 data-cut a total of 3128 subjects had been exposed 
to abrocitinib representing 3001.5 patient years. In addition, 46.4% of subjects (n = 1450) have at 
least 48 weeks of exposure. 
Short-term safety 
The evaluation of short-term safety of exposure to abrocitinib has been performed within the placebo-
controlled studies during the first 12 weeks of therapy, the Primary Safety Pool. 
The Primary Safety Pool has been used to compare the safety profile of individual abrocitinib doses of 
100 mg QD and 200 mg QD with placebo and events with a dose-response relationship. The pool has 
been used to establish frequencies, seriousness, and severity of common AEs in the active treatment 
groups relative to placebo, including most commonly reported TEAEs and treatment related TEAEs, 
including TEAEs of special interest and laboratory data.  
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 185/216 
 
 
 
 
The Primary Safety Pool includes a total of 1540 subjects of the initial submission whereof 124 [8.1%] 
adolescents, with 608 exposed to abrocitinib 100 mg QD, 590 exposed to 200 mg QD, and 342 
exposed to placebo. The median duration of exposure was 86.0 days. Among subjects in the Primary 
Pool, 945 (61.4%) were randomised to a monotherapy study (B7451006, B7451012, B7451013) and 
595 (38.6%) were randomised in a study including background topical therapy (B7451029). The 
exposure in Black/African Americans is significantly lower compared to included subgroups of White 
and Asian Americans. It is understood that AD prevalence is at least similar or even higher in 
Black/African Americans compared to European Americans. The applicant was therefore requested by 
CHMP to discuss if labelling measures are justified for patients of the Black/African subgroup as data 
are limited. It has been clarified that according to the updated figures, the percentage of Black patients 
who experienced TEAEs and SAEs is not higher compared to patients of White Race. It is thus accepted 
that specific labelling measures related to the Black/African American sub-population is not warranted 
in the SmPC.  
The percentage of included subjects experiencing TEAEs was for the placebo group 55.0%, for the 
abrocitinib 100 mg QD group 61.0%, and for the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group 68.3%. The proportion 
of subjects with TEAEs evaluated as treatment-related was similar between the abrocitinib 100 mg QD 
and placebo treatment groups and higher in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD treatment group. The SOCs 
with the highest proportion of events in abrocitinib treatment groups and greater frequency than 
placebo were Infections and infestations, Gastrointestinal disorders, Nervous system disorders, and 
Investigations. Although it is stated in the RMP that no unique risks were identified by race or 
ethnicity, it is noted that TEAEs when treated with abrocitinib 200 mg were more frequent in the Asian 
subgroup (80.1%) compared to Black/African subgroup (66.9%) and White subgroup (70.3%). Upon 
request from the CHMP, the applicant further elaborated on reasons for the incidences of AE, serious 
AEs, severe AEs and discontinuations due to AE being highest in Western Europe compared to all other 
geographic regions as well as the increased proportions in PT acne in Asian subjects and the high 
incidences of the SOC Infections and infestations as well as proportions of nausea in the race subgroup 
“Other”. Cultural differences (e.g. health system and reporting habits), racial differences (increased 
incidences of acne in Asian subjects) as well as heterogeneity in subgroup definition (Others) are being 
presented as possible reasons for deviations in the mentioned subgroups. The applicant further 
discussed reasons for higher proportion of TEAEs in Asian subjects compared to subjects from other 
races, also considering the increased exposure (30% increased AUCinf after 200mg QD) in this 
subgroup. The applicant clarified that the increased proportion in Asian subjects was mainly driven by 
higher incidences in acne and nausea for this subgroup. While the issue is of less relevance for an EU 
population, the applicant was encouraged to follow up on this topic.  
The requested analysis for safety events in the two main studies (B74510412 and B74510413) based 
on season during enrolment did not reveal striking differences related to season of 
enrolment/treatment. A higher exposure was suspected for patients with renal impairment and in 
patients with CYP inhibiting co-mediation as concluded from in silico data. Upon further elaboration, no 
safety concerns arise for these subjects being exposed to the reduced dose of 50mg abrocitinib. Upon 
request from the CHMP, the applicant listed incidences separately for long-term exposure (excluding 
data on short-term exposure) and provided the analysed incidence rates by 12-week periods for all 
AEs, SAEs and AESIs.  No concerns arise from data review. 
Common AEs 
The most frequent events overall (≥2% in any treatment group) that occurred more commonly in the 
abrocitinib groups than placebo and in a dose-related fashion were nausea with frequencies 2%, 6.1% 
and 14.6% in the placebo group, abrocitinib 100 mg QD and abrocitinib 200 mg QD respectively and 
headache with frequencies 3.5%, 5.9% and 7.8% in the placebo group , abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 
abrocitinib 200 mg QD respectively, both TEAEs mainly occurring during the first two weeks of therapy. 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 186/216 
 
 
 
The proportion of subjects having events in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC was higher in female 
subjects, driven largely by nausea and vomiting which were reported in females in 18.1% and 4.2%, 
respectively, relative to male subjects (7.6% and 2.3%, respectively).  
All reported proportions above relate to the initial submission of the primary safety pool (data cut-off 
date 22 April 2020). Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant provided an update on in total 3 
safety data pools, the Full Cumulative Pool (adolescent and adult subjects from studies B7451006, 
B7451012, B7451013, B7451014 (open-label period only), B7451029 and B7451036), the Adolescent 
Short-Term Pool (adolescent patients from studies B7451006, B7451012, B7451013 and B7451036) 
and the Primary Safety Pool + B7451036 (adult and adolescent subjects from studies B7451006, 
B7451012, B7451013, B7451029 and B7451036). The provided safety update comprises data until 
data cut-toff date of 24 July 2020 and the updated Primary Safety Pool + B7451036 is the current 
source of reported data in the SmPC. However, further safety updates are pending and reported 
proportions refer to data from the initial submission. the applicant committed to provide a further 
update of safety data, with data cut in the second half of 2021, as part of a Type II variation in the 
first half of 2022, including an updated SmPC (section 4.8).  
Nausea occurred only in subjects while they were in a fasted period. This has been considered in the 
implementation of a recommendation in SmPC section 4.2 that patients who experience nausea are to 
take abrocitinib with food. Further, nausea is listed as a very common ADRs in SmPC section 4.8. 
Vomiting, herpes simplex, blood creatine phosphokinase increase, and dizziness, also occurring in a 
dose-related fashion are labelled with frequency common. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant 
clarified that acne is a concern for the treatment with JAK inhibitors under development for AD and 
that it is considered an adverse drug reaction. The reported DLQI (dermatology life quality index) 
change from baseline did not indicate a critical change in reported life quality from onset to resolution 
of acne in those patients that had treatment emergent acne. However, due to the high rate of 
observations and a clear dose related effect, patients and investigators should be informed about this 
effect of abrocitinib. Accordingly, treatment emergent acne is reported as a common adverse reaction 
in the proposed SmPC. Upper abdominal pain did also appear to have a dose response and also 
occurred more commonly in the abrocitinib groups compared to placebo though at a frequency <2%. 
Accordingly, treatment emergent upper abdominal pain is reported as a common ADR in SmPC section 
4.8. 
Laboratory 
Haematologic abnormalities (based on the submission of the primary safety pool with data cut-off date 
22 April 2020): Confirmed ALC < 0.5 × 103/mm3 and platelet count < 50 × 103/mm3 were observed 
in less than 0.5% of patients in clinical studies. A higher percentage of subjects in the abrocitinib 100 
mg (18.5%) and abrocitinib 200 mg (20.8%) QD groups had an ALC <1×103/mm3 compared with the 
placebo group (11.9%) and there were 4 subjects meeting discontinuation criteria for lymphopenia 
(confirmed <0.5×103/mm3). These subjects were all older than 65 years of age. A dose-related 
decrease in platelet count with maximum effects observed within 4 weeks were seen. There were 9 
subjects (0.3%) with a confirmed platelet values of <75×103/mm3 (0.1% with confirmed platelet 
counts of < 50 × 103/mm3), all values between week 2 and week 4 of exposure. Although no clear 
population changes in neutrophils were observed in the treatment groups of abrocitinib and no patient 
had a confirmed neutrophil count less than ANC 1.0×103/mm3 there was a dose-response effect in the 
number of subjects with ANC below 2 x10 3/mm3. In addition, pancytopenia was one of the AEs 
leading to discontinuation that occurred in more than 2 subjects. A dose dependent increase in blood 
lipid parameters, both increases in LDL-c and HDL relative to placebo, were reported in patients 
treated with abrocitinib. The LDL/HDL ratio decreased initially over the first 3 months and then 
increased by 5-10%. There was a dose-related increase in subjects reporting AEs of blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased in the Primary Pool. There was a dose-related increase in CK beginning at 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 187/216 
 
 
 
week 4 and having at plateau at week 8. The median change at the last observation was increased in 
the abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD groups (53 U/L and 88 U/L, respectively) relative to the 
placebo group (-2 U/L). There was a dose-related increase in subjects reporting AEs of blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased in the Primary Pool. Two cases of myositis exposed to abrocitinib was 
reported. Additional information was provided concerning thresholds for retest, monitoring as well as 
discontinuation criteria in haematology measures upon request from the CHMP. A statement in the 
SmPC on decreased NK-cell counts and increased B-cell counts was added. High general ALC counts 
were confirmed by the applicant to be temporary. It was clarified that suspected low ANC counts in 
patients ≥65 years and patients of Black/African American race compared to other respective 
subgroups only affected the ANC threshold of < 2x103/mm3. It is agreed that the clinical relevance of 
this threshold is not clear. No subject met the defined discontinuation threshold at ANC <1 × 103/mm3 
and a respective statement regarding treatment discontinuation if ANC is <1 × 103/mm3 for all 
patients is included in the SmPC. A relative risk of hyperlipidaemia is associated with the treatment of 
abrocitinib (due to JAK inhibitor class effects) and the updated SmPC is appropriate to inform about the 
risk of increased blood-lipid parameters and potential cardiovascular complications that might be 
associated with those. The applicant included a statement in the SmPC that in patients with a higher 
burden of cardiovascular risk factors the benefit:risk ratio of abrocitinib compared to that of other 
available therapies for AD should be considered. The SmPC addresses the risks of haematologic 
abnormalities and lipid changes in section 4.4 and thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and 
hyperlipidaemia are included in SmPC section 4.8 with frequency uncommon.  
A clear dose-related increase in events reported for the SOC musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders was observed within the group of patients with increased CK (55.6%, 35.2 and 9.3% for 
200mg, 100mg and placebo treatment, respectively), whereas no meaningful difference in the 
proportion of subjects with events was observed for the general population (regardless of CK values) in 
the primary safety pool. The elevation of CK >5x ULN is reported as a common event for abrocitinib 
treatment in the SmPC (also, 16.4% of subjects treated with 200mg had a creatine kinase measure 
>2xULN, which would fall under very common incidences). However, a temporal relation to muscle 
injuries is observed only sparsely and no clear causality between elevated CK levels and muscle 
injuries can be concluded from data presented upon request. The uncertainty regarding the SOC 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders is also not further substantiated by the presented data 
on Muscle disorders HLGT. Therefore, the potential of myopathies caused via JAK inhibition by 
abrocitinib will be monitored in the post approval setting (See RMP).  
When analysing the All Exposure Pool, subjects with detected CK increase during the first 16 weeks 
experienced remaining CK increase throughout the study period and 5.4% of abrocitinib-treated 
subjects with CK >5xULN. There was no report of rhabdomyolysis in the clinical studies. 
Other AEs 
Other reported AEs were Herpes zoster as a common AE (see further discussion on this issue under the 
long-term safety); and thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, hyperlipidaemia and venous 
thromboembolism, occurring with a frequency uncommon and initially labelled as such in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC.  
SAEs 
The incidence of SAEs was low and were reported in similar proportions of subjects across the 
abrocitinib (100 mg QD was 3.1%; and 200 mg QD was 1.9%) and placebo (3.2%) groups in the 
Primary Pool. They accumulated in a linear fashion over time. However, SAEs of pneumonia (3 
subjects, 0.3%), asthma (3 subjects, 0.3%), and AD (2 subjects, 0.2%) occurred in more than 1 
abrocitinib treated subject; all other SAEs occurred in 1 subject.

Long-term safety 
The long-term safety was evaluated in the All Exposure Pool. This pool included 2856 subjects (12.7% 
adolescents) representing 1614 patient years. Among these subjects 885 were exposed to 100 mg QD 
and 1971 to 200 mg QD i.e. the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group contributed more patient-years of 
exposure relative to the 100 mg QD group (992.9 and 620.8 PY, respectively). There were 1248 
subjects exposed for more than 24 weeks, 995 exposed for more than 36 weeks, and 606 exposed for 
more than 48 weeks (670 subjects with a 12-month visit). Data from this pool have been used to 
determine IRs over time for AEs of special interest, including laboratory parameter and assess dose-
related differences. As discussed by the applicant a limitation of this pool is a lack of comparator, 
therefore external data sources have been used for risk contextualisation. 
AEs 
The proportion of subjects reporting TEAEs in the All Exposure pool were 70.8 % and 72.0 % in the 
abrocitinib 100 mg QD and abrocitinib 200 mg QD respectively. The proportion of subjects with TEAEs 
judged as treatment-related was higher in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD treatment group. Among all 
causality AEs, 38.6% were considered treatment-related by the Investigator. The SOCs with the 
highest proportion of events in abrocitinib treatment groups were Infections and infestations, 
Gastrointestinal disorders, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, Nervous system disorders, and 
Investigations. The most frequent AEs by PT were similar to those in the Primary Pool. 
The most frequent AEs leading to permanent discontinuation in abrocitinib treated subjects were 
dermatitis atopic (1.9%), nausea (0.5%), and headache (0.4%). 
Herpes simplex was reported in 2.6% and 2.7% of the abrocitinib 100 mg QD and abrocitinib 200 mg 
QD respectively and Herpes zoster in 1.4% and 2.0% of the abrocitinib 100 mg QD and abrocitinib 200 
mg QD respectively. Of the subjects who had an event of herpes simplex, approximately 50% of 
subjects had an initial event of herpes simplex in the first 3 months of therapy (48.2% in abrocitinib 
100 mg QD group and 57.8% in abrocitinib 200 mg QD group. In the proposed SmPC, herpes simplex 
is labelled with frequency common and herpes zoster with frequency uncommon. The applicant was 
requested to clarify if the cases reported as opportunistic infections have been included in the 
calculation of frequency of herpes zoster. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant clarified that the 
cases of opportunistic herpes zoster infection have been included with the frequency for herpes zoster. 
Furthermore, the applicant agreed to use the frequencies for the abrocitinib 200 mg dose for the 
tabular list of adverse reactions. As such, herpes zoster is now included as common with a frequency 
of 1.2% in SmPC section 4.8. 
SAEs 
Three fatal cases were reported, all in abrocitinib-treated subjects. One case of sudden CV death 
occurred 22 days after cessation of study drug, one case was associated with a COVID-19 infection, 
both events assessed as not related to study drug per the investigator. The third fatal case was 
diagnosed with a gastric Adenocarcinoma on Study Day 43. The time-event relationship is not in favour 
of a suspected causality association with abrocitinib. Following the safety update as of April 2021 two 
additional fatal events (Covid-19 and septic shock) were recorded. The fatal event of Covid-19 
infection was considered unrelated to study drug (100mg). The event of septic shock was considered 
related to study drug by the investigator. Serious infections are an important potential risk and routine 
as well as additional risk minimisation measures (Prescriber Brochure and Patient Card) are proposed.

AEs seem to accumulate in a linear fashion over time and there was no dose response for SAEs. In the 
All Exposure Pool treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 5.3 % and 3.6 % of the abrocitinib 100 
mg QD and abrocitinib 200 mg QD, respectively. The Infections and Infestations SOC had the highest

incidence of SAEs. The most frequent adverse events were AD, asthma, pneumonia, eczema 
herpeticum, and intervertebral disc protrusion. There were 6 subjects with an SAE of asthma and 1 
with an SAE of status asthmaticus. Among these, 5 subjects had a history of asthma and 1 subject had 
a history of bronchospasm. Of note though is that in the Primary Pool, overall events of asthma were 
not more frequent in the abrocitinib 100 and 200 mg QD groups (1.0 and 0.3%, respectively) 
compared to the placebo group (0.9%). Asthma was a common comorbidity in the population, being 
reported as ongoing in more than 30% of subjects. Of note, the assessment of asthma control via the 
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) in the scope of study B7451014 does not suggest worsening of 
asthma control for subjects treated with 200mg abrocitinib within the first 12-weeks of study 
treatment and the safety update of the full cumulative pool does not suggest a general increase in 
severe asthma with increasing dose of abrocitinib.  
Upon request from the CHMP, case histories of five asthma events have been presented by the 
applicant Furthermore, a discussion of the cause relationship of asthma and abrocitinib exposure was 
requested in the subject experiencing status asthmaticus. The requested case history of the patient 
with status asthmaticus as well as a summary of case histories of the other five patients experiencing 
asthma plus two additional cases from the safety update have been presented. All patients had a 
history of asthma. In three of the eight cases, study drug was withdrawn while for the other five 
patients the asthma symptoms resolved, and they continued study drug. The adolescent male 
experiencing status asthmaticus had apparently been non-compliant with his asthma medication and 
the event was considered due to that.  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
The reports on AESI by subgroup were limited to IRs for serious infections or all herpes zoster for 
some of the chosen factors. The applicant provided proportions and incidence rates for treatment-
emergent SAEs, AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation, deaths, and AEs for infections, 
malignancies and cardiovascular events for the requested subgroups baseline age, gender and baseline 
disease severity, all for the Full Cumulative Pool and including data from the abrocitinib AD 2020 
Safety Update. Upon request from the CHMP, a section on elderly patients is included in SmPC section 
4.4 (with cross-reference to section 4.8) and an additional comment was added on the observation 
that elderly were more likely to have serious adverse events compared to younger patients. As a 
consequence of the potentially increased risk for elderly patients, the applicant proposed a starting 
dose of 100mg once daily for elderly patients aged ≥ 65 years. This has been adequately reflected in 
the SmPC. 
Venous thromboembolism: There were 5 events reported; 3 events of PE and 2 events of DVT all in the 
200 mg QD group. Although there were few events, the IR was higher than the background rates in 
patients with AD in cohort studies. In the initially proposed SmPC VTE is labelled as uncommon. Upon 
request from the CHMP, the applicant agreed to explicitly mention PE as an ADR (e.g. ‘venous 
thromboembolism/pulmonary embolism’) in SmPC section 4.8.  
Serious infections: The most frequently reported serious infections were pneumonia, herpes zoster, 
and herpes simplex. A Higher incidence of herpes zoster including ophthalmic herpes zoster (4 cases), 
with abrocitinib compared to placebo as well as a dose response across the abrocitinib groups was 
shown. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant agreed to include pneumonia in SmPC section 4.8 
with a frequency uncommon. Furthermore, in view of the important potential risk of serious infections, 
active serious systemic infections including TB was added as contraindication in section 4.3 of the 
SmPC.  
Malignancies: There were 7 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer [0.42/100 PY (95% CI: 0.17, 0.86)], 3 
subjects in the abrocitinib 100 mg QD group and 4 subjects in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group and 4 
events of potential malignancy (2 events of prostate cancer and 2 events of ovarian neoplasm) in the 
Assessment report - Cibinqo

   Page 190/216 
 
 
 
clinical database at the time of release. Comparisons were made with data from KPNC (Kaiser 
Permanente) and THIN databases. Overall, the IRs for malignancies (excluding NMSC) and NMSC in 
the KPNC and THIN databases were comparable to those seen in the AD clinical programme. However, 
although no direct evidence for a serious risk for malignancies was found yet, due to the potential lack 
of sensitive monitoring an increased risk cannot be excluded at this time of assessment. Upon request 
from the CHMP, the applicant provided an update from available long-term data with a 
contextualisation based on the Danish Registry and the THIN registry as well as pending adjudication 
data. Reported incidence rates do not suggest a causal relationship between the treatment with 
abrocitinib and the occurrence of malignancies, at least for the time period that was investigated. 
Although no direct evidence for a serious risk for malignancies was identified to date, the potential 
association between AD and malignancies as well as JAK inhibitor treatment and malignancies justifies 
the inclusion of malignancies as an important potential risk in the list of safety concerns of the RMP. A 
warning in this regard is also included in SmPC section 4.4. 
Other AEs of interest 
Hypersensitivity: There were together seven cases of either swelling of eyes, swelling of eyelids, 
oedema of eyelids and oedema of eye reported for the abrocitinib treated subjects in the primary 
safety pool and only one case of eyelid swelling in the placebo group. In the All safety pool there are in 
total 13 cases of eye reactions, this included the previous terms as well as conjunctival oedema and 
eye allergy. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant commented that ocular comorbidities and 
symptoms are common in patients with AD, including conjunctivitis and keratitis and that there was an 
inverse dose response and events were less frequent in patients with well controlled disease (IGA 0 or 
1). Therefore, the data suggest that there is no meaningful risk of increased ocular symptoms 
associated with abrocitinib therapy and thus no need to reflect those into SmPC section 4.8.  
ECG measurement in the clinical studies: In the All Exposure Pool, all subjects with measured increase 
of QTcF were in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD (group1 subject in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group had a 
QTcF of >500 msec, and 5 subjects in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD group had a change from screening 
>60 msec QTcF. As all changes are described in the 200 mg QD a dose dependent effect cannot be 
excluded, thus the applicant was requested to discuss the relevance of cautionary measures in the 
SmPC. The applicant acknowledged that analysis of outliers according to categorical responses (QTcF > 
500 msec, delta QTcF > 60 msec) may provide insights into the potential of a drug to prolong the QT 
interval in a susceptible individual and hence to precipitate Torsades de Pointes. However, that these 
findings should be balanced with the performed in vitro studies of ion channels demonstrating no 
clinically meaningful inhibition of hERG channels indicating potential proarrhythmic effects and a 
performed controlled TQT study (B7451027) in healthy adult volunteers in which the mean effect on 
QTcF at peak plasma concentration was 7.12 msec indicating an unlikely potential of torsadogenic 
effect.  Considering the outcome of the TQT study and additional justifications provided by the 
applicant, the conclusion not to introduce additional information in the SmPC concerning QT changes is 
acceptable. 
Liver: There were 2 SAEs of drug-induced liver injury and 7 other liver AEs adjudicated as a possible 
DILI (probability 25-50%). No cases were adjudicated as a probable, highly likely, or definite DILI 
case. No subject met Hy’s law criteria. Further, use in patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic 
impairment is added as a contraindication in SmPC section 4.3 due to the lack of information regarding 
influence of severe hepatic impairment as these subjects were not included in the PK study of 
abrocitinib. This is agreed.  
Renal: There was one case of acute renal injury reported. Based on the recommendations in SmPC 
section 4.2 with regards to dosing reductions in patients with renal insufficiency, the applicant was 
requested to clarify how many of the total number of 42 study subjects (26.4 PY) in the eGFR <60 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 191/216 
 
 
 
mL/min subgroup, that received 50mg QD and 100 mg QD abrocitinib respectively. Furthermore, how 
many of these subjects that experienced adverse events in each dosing group. The applicant has 
clarified that in the development programme AD patients were randomised to receive 200 or 100 mg 
QD doses regardless of their renal function. It appears from presented data that subjects with serious 
adverse events are overrepresented in the baseline eGFR <60 mL/min group with 18.2%, 9.7% and 
11.9% for exposure to abrocitinib 100 mg, 200mg and all abrocitinib, respectively compared to the 60-
<90 mL/min group with 5.6%  2.5 and 3.4% for exposure to abrocitinib 100 mg, 200mg and all 
abrocitinib, respectively and the  >90 mL/min group with 5.2%, 4.1% and 4.4% for exposure to 
abrocitinib 100 mg, 200mg and all abrocitinib, respectively. These findings would thus be in support of 
a dose reduction of abrocitinib in patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min. The proposed dose reductions 
reflected in SmPC section 4.2 are agreed.  
Apart from the common AE abdominal pain upper, there were 3 subjects (0.1%) reporting GI 
perforation (all upper GI events) in the All Exposure pool, 2 subjects (0.2%) in the abrocitinib 100 mg 
QD and 1 subject (0.1%) in the 200 mg QD group. The applicant was requested by CHMP to further 
discuss the need for inclusion of this safety issue in the SmPC. Based on the review of events of upper 
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting in the All safety pool from the perspective of individual co-
occurrence, timing, resolution incl. time to resolution, and cause of study discontinuation; the applicant 
considered a warning and precaution in the SmPC related to gastrointestinal perforation associated 
with abdominal pain/vomiting was not warranted. As GI perforation is added to the RMP as an 
important potential risk it will be closely monitored following post approval, bringing further 
information of this potential risk and the need of an SmPC update.  
Weight increase has been reported for other JAK inhibitors. The number of individuals is limited at 
Months 24 and 27 but at Months 21 there seems to be an increase of the All abrocitinib group (median 
86, mean 91.7) compared to baseline weight (median 73, mean 75.2.) Weight increase was requested 
to be further discussed for inclusion in the SmPC. The applicant clarified that there is a small increase 
in BMI but as there is no consistent dose response the proposal is not to include weight increase in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. This is agreed.  
Subgroups 
Adolescents 
The indication initially proposed for abrocitinib included adolescents 12-<18 years of age as well as 
adults. 
In non-clinical studies, abrocitinib induced effects on bone development and the effect of abrocitinib on 
bone metabolism in humans is not clear. Permanent impact on skeletal development cannot be 
excluded. Abrocitinib exposure on bone development was evaluated clinically by HT SDS and fracture 
rate in adolescents >12 years of age. A safety update with data-cut April 2021 was submitted as part 
of the responses to D180 LoOI. The Full Cumulative Pool included 635 adolescents with 646.2 PY. In 
the April 2021 data there were 296 adolescent subjects with height data to Day 360. The rate of 
fracture in adolescent subjects in the 100 mg group was 0.78 per 100 PY (2 events; 95% CI: 0.09, 
2.80)] and in the 200 mg was 1.50 per 100 PY (6 events; 95% CI: 0.55, 3.26). Those data may 
suggest a potential of a dose related effect on fractures. Furthermore, uncertainties still remained 
whether the applied clinical measures are sensitive enough to satisfactorily provide reassuring data for 
safe use in adolescents >12 years of age and the reported data on height SDS as well as for fractures 
was premature for final evaluation. Due to the findings of detrimental effects on bone development in 
preclinical studies and the uncertainties of the relevance of these findings for growing adolescents, the 
therapeutic indication has been restricted to adults > 18 years of age only. 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 192/216 
 
 
 
Further studies to investigate bone safety in adolescents have been proposed by the applicant. The 
same clinical measures/endpoints will be collected in the proposed post-authorisation safety B7451084 
study (please refer to the RMP). The applicant also proposed to initiate a sub-study within the frame of 
the ongoing long-term extension study B7451015, in order to further investigate potential clinical 
implications on bone development for adolescent subjects >12 years of age that are exposed to 
abrocitinib. The proposed study concept aims for annual MRI images of the knee and is principally 
supported. These studies are planned to be performed post-approval.  
Adults and elderly might suffer from consequences on bone physiology that would impact the benefit-
risk evaluation and the applicant was thus asked to elaborate on bone effects for these age groups as 
well. Upon assessment of data provided by the applicant, no matter of concern arises from presented 
data on osteoporosis or fractures reported for adult (18 -<65 years) or elderly (≥65 years) that were 
treated with abrocitinib. It is recognised that the assessment of reported AEs might not be sensitive 
enough to detect unreported effects in bone physiology and study duration might not be sufficiently 
long for potential bone effects to be experienced as an AE. Further, non-clinical data on bone findings 
are described in the updated SmPC in section 5.3. Potential effects on bone physiology cannot be 
excluded, however, based on available data this risk appears specifically high for developing bones. 
Although there was generally no significant difference in the safety profile of abrocitinib of adolescents 
as presented in the clinical data, there were some issues related to this subgroup that needed 
clarification. There was a higher percentage of TEAEs compared to the total population in the analysis 
of the Primary Safety Pool and compared to the age group 18-<65 years of age of the All Exposure 
group. Based on this and the assumption of dose dependent TEAES, the applicant was asked to discuss 
safety in relation to abrocitinib exposure in adolescents. Concerns based on slightly different exposure 
values calculated based on the initial adolescent dataset were further mitigated as updated results 
based on larger adolescent datasets indicate that there is no clinically relevant difference in exposure 
between the two age cohorts, also considering worst case scenario (light-weight adolescents). 
Furthermore, in the analyses of the updated safety pool TEAEs and SAEs do not seem to be 
overrepresented in adolescents compared to adults.    
According to the table of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class (All Causalities) 
by Baseline Age Primary Safety Pool- there was a clear discrepancy and increase of the percentage of 
reported TEAEs within the SOC “Respiratory, Thoracic And Mediastinal Disorders” of abrocitinib treated 
subjects < 18 years of age compared to the total population. Upon request from the CHMP, the 
applicant clarified that pooled data of study B7451036 and the Primary Safety Pool in the safety update 
no longer demonstrate a discrepancy of percentage of reported TEAEs within the SOC “Respiratory, 
Thoracic And Mediastinal Disorders” of abrocitinib treated subjects < 18 years of age compared to 
placebo.  
Elderly 
Most subjects with malignancy events were >60 years of age. The rate of herpes zoster infections was 
higher in patients 65 years of age and older. Most subjects meeting discontinuation criteria for 
haematology labs were also ≥65 years of age, apparently absolute lymphocyte counts <0.5 × 
103/mm3 occurred only in patients ≥65 years of age and a higher proportion of patients ≥65 years of 
age had platelets <75 × 103/mm3. Furthermore, the percentage of subjects with SAEs exposed to 
combined strengths of 100mg QD abrocitinib and 200 mg QD abrocitinib were 3.8%, 10.3% and 16 % 
for individuals 18-≥65 years of age, >65 years of age and >75 years of age respectively. Based on 
these safety findings, the exposure and dosing recommendations of abrocitinib in this subgroup were 
requested to be further justified by the applicant. As part of its responses, the applicant revised dosing 
in elderly to recommend a starting dose of abrocitinib 100 mg for patients aged ≥65 years. The 
proposed SmPC includes information about specific findings in elderly in SmPC section 4.8 incl. that

data is limited in elderly>75 years of age. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant submitted a 
summary table of the abrocitinib 2020 Safety Update Full Cumulative Pool of the 100 mg and 200 mg 
treatment groups for the applied age subgroups <65, 65 - <75, 75 - <85, ≥ 85 years.  
An increase in proportions of the SOC musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders was observed 
with increasing age (2.2% in adolescent, 5.2% in adult and 12.4% in elderly across both doses). 
Contextualisation of reported incidences of musculoskeletal disorders with epidemiological references 
does not raise further concern for the treatment with abrocitinib in this aspect. A comment on 
increased serious and severe AEs as well as a higher rate of discontinuations due to AEs in elderly 
patients is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
There were no significant differences between the safety profile of abrocitinib as monotherapy or in 
combination with topical medicated therapy in terms of frequent events, serious and severe events, or 
AEs leading to discontinuation for subjects enrolled in the combination therapy study (B7451029).  
Pregnancy 
Ten cases of exposure in utero reported in subjects exposed to abrocitinib in the AD clinical 
programme, 7 maternal exposures and 3 partner exposures. Of the 7 maternal exposers there were 
two miscarriages and five with outcome unknown. Further data on these outcomes were requested. For 
other JAK inhibitors the use is contraindicated during pregnancy and based on the non-clinical data and 
assessment this would have been expected for abrocitinib as well. Upon request the applicant has 
implemented this as a contraindication in section 4.3 of the SmPC.  
Overall, the demonstrated safety profile of abrocitinib showed similarities with other JAK inhibitors and 
is consistent with the mechanism of action. The exposure of patients to abrocitinib is considered 
sufficiently sized and the detected relevant adverse events at large adequately addressed in the SmPC.  
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Abrocitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor. The present safety profile of data derived from the 
performed phase 2 and phase 3 studies demonstrates similarities with other JAK inhibitors. These 
include common reactions such as nausea, headache, acne, vomiting, herpes simplex, blood creatine 
phosphokinase increase, and dizziness, haematological effects with a decrease in lymphocytes and 
platelets and cases of serious infections as well as opportunistic infections and venous 
thromboembolism reported. Overall, the exposure of patients to abrocitinib is considered sufficiently 
sized and the detected relevant adverse events are adequately addressed in the SmPC.  
Due to the findings of detrimental effects on bone development in preclinical studies and the 
uncertainties of the relevance of these findings for growing adolescents, the therapeutic indication has 
been restricted to adults > 18 years of age only. 
Abrocitinib is contraindicated in active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections, severe hepatic 
impairment, pregnancy and breast feeding.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially claimed indication was treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults 
and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Atopic dermatitis is a common disease affecting the skin that often starts in early childhood. The 
clinical picture differs depending on the affected subjects age, infants and toddlers have different 
locations on the body affected by the disease compared with adolescents and adults. In some cases, 
the disease disappears during puberty, however, there are many individuals with the more severe 
forms of AD that respond inadequately to standard treatment, most often emollients and topical 
corticosteroids of different potency. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Available therapies include moisturizing creams (skin hydration and restoration of the skin barrier) and 
topical therapies (Corticosteroids, Calcineurin Inhibitors and PDE4 Inhibitor) and systemic therapies. 
Ciclosporin is approved for treatment of severe AD in most European countries but is not suitable for 
long-term use due to toxicities. Dupilumab (Dupixent) is approved within the EU for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe AD from the age of 12 years old, and in children ≥6 years old in severe AD. 
Barititinib (Olumiant) and tralokinumab (Adtralza) have recently been approved for treatment of 
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. In 
addition, the JAK inhibitor upadacitinib (Rinvoq) is now approved for moderate to severe AD in 
adolescents and adults. 
The applicant claims the proposed product to have a fast relief of itch, one of the most troublesome 
symptoms in AD. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is two Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group studies with identical design; study B7451012 (n=387) and study B7451013 (n=391) 
the so-called monotherapy studies. Furthermore, a Phase 3, multi-centre active control study on 
background topical therapy study B7451029 (n=838) has been performed (combination therapy 
study). 
All three studies were performed in the US/Canada/EU/Asia/South America. The subjects included 
should have a clinical diagnosis of chronic AD with inadequate response to treatment with topical 
medication. The AD should be of moderate to severe degree (affected BSA ≥10%, IGA≥3, EASI≥16, and 
Pruritus NRS≥4 at the baseline visit).  
The monotherapy studies B7451012 and B7451013 included adolescents (≥12 years of age), while 
study B7451029 was performed in adults only. The inclusion criteria of the performed clinical studies 
are considered adequate to reflect the proposed therapeutic indication. The exclusion criteria reflected 
general warnings for use of JAK inhibitors, e.g. with respect to infection, haematological abnormalities, 
viral reactivation and the risks for venous thromboembolism.  
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 202/216 
 
 
 
Eligible subjects were treated with abrocitinib 100 mg QD or 200 mg QD or placebo for 12 weeks in 
studies B7451012 and B7451013, and for 20 weeks in study B7451029. In study B7451029, 
dupilumab (Dupixent) was used as active comparator. Blinded dupilumab, 300 mg/ml, and its 
matching placebo were dosed according to label of the product. Duplimab was when the clinical 
programme of abrocitinib was designed and implemented, the only marketed product indicated for 
moderate to severe AD. The choice of comparator is therefore considered appropriate and of relevance 
in view of the EU approved treatment options. Recently, another JAK-inhibitor baricitinib (Olumiant) 
has received positive opinion for a new indication, treatment of moderate to severe AD in adults.  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints, and key secondary efficacy endpoints used in the pivotal Phase 3 
studies in the clinical development programme, are well established endpoints used for drug 
development in AD. 
The following three supportive studies are considered important for this application:   
B7451015 (EXTEND) is a phase 3 open-label, ongoing safety study in patients who completed the 
parent studies. 
B7451014 (REGIMEN) is a phase 3 randomised withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
conducted in the target population. This study is now completed, and study documentation has been 
submitted within D120 LoQ responses upon request from the CHMP. 
B7451036 (TEEN) is a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, study in adolescent 
subjects 12 to <18 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD investigating abrocitinib co-administered 
with background medicated topical therapy. This study is now completed, and study documentation 
has been submitted within D120 LoQ responses upon request from the CHMP. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Monotherapy studies 
In study B7451012, the first co-primary efficacy parameter which evaluated the proportion of 
subjects who achieved an IGA response of clear or almost clear and a more than 2 points improvement 
from baseline at week 12, was statistically significant for both the 100 mg group 23.7 (17.0, 30.4) and 
the 200 mg group 43.8 (35.9, 51.7) compared with placebo 7.9 (1.8, 14.0). The corresponding values 
obtained in study B7451013 was for the 100 mg group 28.4 (21.3, 35.5) and the 200 mg group 38.1 
(30.4, 45.7) compared with placebo 9.1 (2.7, 15.5).  
The second co-primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of subjects who achieved an EASI 
response of >= 75% improvement from baseline at week 12, and was for the abrocitnib 100 mg group 
39.7 (32.1, 47.4) and for the 200 mg group 62.7 (55.1, 70.4) compared with placebo 11.8 (4.6, 19.1) 
in study B7451012. The corresponding results obtained in study B7451013 was for the 100 mg 
group 44.5 (36.7, 52.3) and the 200 mg group 61.0 (53.3, 68.7) compared with placebo 10.4 (3.6, 
17.2).  
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were ≥4 points improvement from baseline in the peak pruritus 
NRS scale (PP-NRS4) at weeks 2, 4 and 12, and the change from baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms 
Assessment for AD (PSAAD). In study B7451012, results obtained with the PP-NRS4 scale were 37.7 
(29.2, 46.3) for abrocitinib 100 mg, 57.2 (48.8, 65.6.) for abrocitinib 200 mg and 15.3 (6.6, 24.0) for 
the placebo group at week 12. The corresponding results obtained in study B7451013 were 45.2 
(37.1, 53.3) for abrocitinib 100 mg, 55.3 (47.2, 63.5) for abrocitinib 200 mg and 11.5 (4.1, 19.0) for 
placebo at week 12. In both studies, a statistically significant efficacy on itch was noted already at 
week 2. A dose-response relationship was obtained with a more pronounced efficacy on itch noted in 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 203/216 
 
 
 
the 200 QD group compared with 100 mg QD group. Maximum efficacy evaluated as PP-NRS-4 was 
obtained during week 4 in study B7451012, and during week 4-8 in study B7451013. 
In study B7451012, the change from baseline on itch evaluated by PSAAD at week 12 was -2.2 (-2.6, 
-1.9) for 100 mg and -3.2 (-3.6, -2.8) for 200 mg compared with -1.1 (-1.7, -0.6) for placebo. In 
study B7451013, the change from baseline on itch evaluated by PSAAD at week 12 was -2.4 (-2.8, -
2.1) for 100 mg and -3.0 (-3.3, -2.7) for 200 mg compared with -0.8 (-1.3, -0.3) for placebo. 
Superiority of abrocitinib 100 mg QD (p<0.001) and 200 mg QD(p<0.001) to vehicle were 
demonstrated also for itch evaluated by PSAAD in both the monotherapy studies. 
To conclude, superiority of abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD versus placebo was demonstrated in 
both co-primary efficacy endpoints (IGA and EASI-75) which are well established clinical endpoints 
used in AD studies. A dose-response relationship was shown, with the highest level of efficacy obtained 
for the dose 200 mg QD. The key secondary efficacy endpoints (PP-NRS-4 and PSAAD) that evaluated 
efficacy on itch supported the results obtained with the primary efficacy endpoints, that is a dose-
dependent efficacy of abrocitinib which was superior to placebo. The results are considered of clinical 
relevance for the target population. 
Subgroup analyses by intrinsic factors (age, sex, race ethnicity, weight and body mass index, disease 
severity by IGA and EASI, percent BSA affected by AD, and comorbidities) and extrinsic factors 
(geographic region and prior therapy for AD) demonstrated that effects of each dose of abrocitinib 
were similar across subgroups for the co-primary endpoints IGA and EASI-75. The effects of each dose 
of abrocitinib were similar across subgroups also for the key secondary efficacy endpoint PP-NRS4. 
Both abrocitinib doses were efficacious regardless of the subject’s baseline severity or extent of AD. 
Combination therapy study 
In the active control study B7451029, the efficacy of abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD was 
compared with that of dupilumab 300 mg/ml while all subjects where on medicated topical therapy 
(mainly TCS). 
The results of the co-primary efficacy endpoint which evaluated the proportion of subjects who 
achieved an IGA response of clear or almost clear and a more than 2 points improvement from 
baseline at week 12, was statistically significant for both the 100 mg group 36.6 (30.4, 42.8), the 200 
mg group 48.4 (41.8, 55.0) and dupilumab group 36.5 (30.4, 42.6) compared with placebo 14.0 (8.0, 
19.9).  
The corresponding results for the second co-primary efficacy parameter, the proportion of subjects 
who achieved an EASI response of >= 75% improvement from baseline at week 12, was for the 100 
mg group 58.7 (52.4, 65.0), the 200 mg group 70.3 (64.3, 76.4), dupilumab 58.1 (51.9, 64.3) and for 
placebo 27.1 (19.5, 34.8).  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint PP-NRS4 responder proportion at week 2 was statistically 
significantly higher for abrocitinib 100 mg 31.8 (25.8, 37.7) and for 200 mg 49.1 (42.6, 55.6) 
compared with placebo 13.8 (7.9, 19.8). Abrocitinib 200 mg QD had statistically significantly higher 
proportion of PP-NRS4 responders at week 2 compared with dupilumab 26.4 (20.8, 31.9), while the 
difference between abrocitinib 100 mg and dupilumab at week 2 did not reach statistical significance). 
PP-NRS4 responder proportion at weeks 12 and 16 were also higher for abrocitinib 100 mg and 
abrocitinib 200 mg compared with placebo. 
IGA responder proportion at week 16, was statistically significantly higher for abrocitinib 100 mg 34.8 
(28.6, 40.9) and for 200 mg 47.5 (40.9, 54.1) compared with placebo 12.9 (7.0, 18.8). When 
compared with dupilumab, treatment effect (IGA responder proportion corrected for placebo) at week 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 204/216 
 
 
 
16 was greater with abrocitinib 200 mg QD than dupilumab 38.8 (32.5, 45.1), and similar between 
abrocitinib 100 mg QD and dupilumab.  
For the third key secondary efficacy endpoint, proportion of EASI-75 responders, a statistically 
significantly higher efficacy for abrocitinib 100 mg 60.3 (53.9, 66.6) and for 200 mg 71.0 (65.1, 77.0) 
compared with placebo 30.6 (22.5, 38.8). When compared with dupilumab, treatment effect (IGA 
responder proportion corrected for placebo) at week 16 was greater with abrocitinib 200 mg QD than 
dupilumab 65.5 (59.4, 71.6), and similar between abrocitinib 100 mg QD and dupilumab.  
Meaningful improvements in quality of life and psychosocial well-being were demonstrated, especially 
with the 200mg dose. 
To conclude, superiority of abrocitinib 100 mg QD, 200 mg QD and dupilumab versus placebo was 
demonstrated. Interestingly, the level of efficacy was similar for abrocitinib 100 mg QD and for 
dupilumab, while in the first 12 weeks of treatment abrocitinib 200 mg QD was superior to dupilumab 
when dosed according to label. The efficacy of itch is also dose-dependent and can be noted earlier 
with abrocitinib than with dupilumab. These results are assessed to be of clinical relevance. 
Adolescents 
Adolescents were included in both the monotherapy studies, 84 subjects in study B7451012 and 40 
subjects in study B7451013, but not in study B7451029. Study B7451036, assessing abrocitinib as 
add-on to concomitant medicated topical therapy in adolescents is now completed. Study B7451036 
confirm efficacy findings from other trials and support inclusion of this age cohort into the target 
population from an efficacy perspective. However, there are safety concerns that led to the restriction 
of indication to adults only (see further below). Both co-primary endpoints of IGA and EASI-75 
responses at Week 12 were met for both doses. 
Maintenance of efficacy 
In the maintenance study B7451015, the effect was maintained over 48 weeks in 502 subjects, 
including 73 adolescents. In the overall population of the long-term therapy pool, response rates for 
IGA, EASI-75 and PP-NRS4 at week 48 of abrocitinib treatment were similar to or higher than those at 
week 12 for either dose of abrocitinib. The mean percent change from baseline in EASI and PP-NRS 
scores were also similar between week 12 and week 48. Long-term analyses indicated also that there 
was a late-onset response among subjects who were previously non-responders at 12 weeks. The 
effect was largely maintained also beyond 48 (data up to 96 weeks are available). 
Supportive studies 
At week 12, the end of the open label run in period of B7451014, 64.3% of the 1233 patients 
achieved IGA response, 74.4% achieved EASI-75, and 67.3% achieved PP-NRS4.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Methods including dosing of the product 
The 50 mg dose has not been tested during the clinical development in any population and no PK data 
for the 50 mg strength are available. The respective dose recommendations are based on extrapolation 
and on the results from simulations performed with the population PK model.  
Most of the data collected to describe abrocitinib long-term effects were collected in a single blinded 
manner (treatment assignment was disclosed to the investigators but not to the patients). 
Results

EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 205/216 
 
 
 
In the combination therapy study B7451029, several treatment options were allowed (topical 
corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) or a PDE4 inhibitor (e.g., 
crisaborole) may be used instead of corticosteroids. The net efficacy result with abrocitinib 100 mg QD 
or 200 QD plus these medicated topical therapies used, and more precisely the extra efficacy in 
percent achieved when the patients are on combination therapy with TCS, calcineurin inhibitors or 
crisaborole is thus not known.  As no specific claim were made on this in the SmPC section 5.1, this 
issue was not further pursued by the CHMP.  
The applicant claims that in study B7451029 the 200 mg QD dose of abrocitinib demonstrated a larger 
treatment effect across multiple endpoints at week 16. However, data indicated that while the 
abrocitinib curves have reached a plateau, the dupilumab effect seems still on the rise for some 
endpoints. Overall, the 16-weeks study duration are too short to finally conclude on the cumulated 
effect of both treatments. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Nausea occurred more commonly in females. The applicant is of the opinion that symptoms might be 
reduced when abrocitinib is taken in a fed state compared to fasted state. This conclusion appears 
reasonable although based on data from 2 Phase 1 studies (B7451004 and B7451032) with low 
numbers of healthy subjects and heterogeneity in tested doses as well as formulations of abrocitinib. 
The product information was updated to reflect that in patients who experience nausea, taking tablets 
with food may improve nausea.  
The haematological profile of patients is vulnerable to the treatment with abrocitinib. Significant 
haematologic abnormalities compared to placebo with a dose-related decrease in platelet count with 
maximum effects observed within 4 weeks (median platelet values remained below baseline after 3 
months) as well as subjects meeting discontinuation criteria for lymphopenia (confirmed 
<0.5×103/mm3) were seen. In the All Exposure Pool, 3 subjects were discontinued due to low platelet 
counts, all treated with 200mg. Furthermore, all subjects with reported AE of thrombocytopenia were 
treated with 200mg and all reported bleeding events were in the 200mg treatment group (5 events in 
the AEP with mild to moderate severity, one of these events led to discontinuation). Although no clear 
population changes in neutrophils were observed in the treatment groups of abrocitinib and no patient 
had a confirmed neutrophil count less than ANC 1.0×103/mm3 there was a dose-response effect in the 
number of subjects with ANC below 2 x103/mm3. In addition, pancytopenia was one of the AEs leading 
to discontinuation that occurred in more than 2 subjects. In Study B7451029 a B-cell increase and a 
substantial NK-cell decrease was observed.  
All 7 reported subjects that met discontinuation thresholds for haematology measures in the AEP were 
in the 200mg treatment group and additionally 3 subjects (1 from 100mg and 2 from 200mg 
treatment groups) were discontinued due to pancytopenia. All patients meeting monitoring criteria for 
neutrophils in study B7451006 (103/mm3<2) were treated with 200mg abrocitinib (10.9%). All 
patients meeting monitoring criteria for haemoglobin in study B7451006 (g/dL<11) were treated with 
abrocitinib (3.6% and 5.5% for 100mg and 200mg, respectively). 
Elderly had a higher risk for haematology changes (especially low ALC, haemoglobin and platelets), 
herpes zoster infections and high LDL (>130 mg/dL).  
A dose dependent increase in blood lipid parameters-both increases in LDL-c and HDL relative to 
placebo were reported in patients treated with abrocitinib as well as a dose-related increase in subjects 
reporting AEs of blood creatine phosphokinase increased in the Primary Pool. A higher proportion of 
subjects in the 200mg treatment group crossed the threshold of creatine kinase measure >5xULN

   Page 206/216 
 
 
 
(3.8% for 200mg, 1.8% for 100mg and 1.8% for placebo, respectively). Two cases of myositis 
exposed to abrocitinib was reported but no report of rhabdomyolysis.  
The incidence of SAEs was low and were reported in similar proportions of subjects across the 
abrocitinib (100 mg QD was 3.1%; and 200 mg QD was 1.9%) and placebo (3.2%) groups in the 
Primary Pool. They accumulated in a linear fashion over time. However, SAEs of pneumonia (3 
subjects, 0.3%), asthma (3 subjects, 0.3%), and dermatitis atopic (2 subjects, 0.2%) occurred in 
more than 1 abrocitinib treated subject; all other SAEs occurred in 1 subject. Furthermore, serious and 
severe AEs are more likely to occur in elderly. 
The long-term safety was evaluated in the All Exposure Pool. The proportion of subjects reporting 
TEAEs in the All Exposure Pool were 70.8 % and 72.0 % in the abrocitinib 100 mg QD and abrocitinib 
200 mg QD respectively. The proportion of subjects with TEAEs judged as treatment-related was 
higher in the abrocitinib 200 mg QD treatment group. 
Herpes simplex was reported in 2.8% and 4.8% of the abrocitinib 100 mg QD and abrocitinib 200 mg 
QD respectively and Herpes zoster in 0.6% and 1.2% of the abrocitinib 100 mg QD and abrocitinib 200 
mg QD respectively. Serious infections with herpes simplex and herpes zoster were recorded for 200 
mg in the AEP only (2 and 3 subjects, respectively). A statistically higher risk to suffer from herpes 
zoster infections upon treatment with 200 mg abrocitinib was concluded for subjects with age ≥65 
years (proportions: 4.3%, 2.3% and 1.3% in subjects ≥65 years, 18-<65 and <18, respectively) and 
for patients with severe baseline AD disease (proportions: 3.2% and 1.6% in subjects with severe and 
moderate disease, respectively). Treatment emergent SAEs were reported in 5.3 % and 3.6 % of the 
abrocitinib 100 mg QD and abrocitinib 200 mg QD respectively. The Infections and infestations SOC 
had the highest incidence of SAEs with the most frequently reported serious infections being 
pneumonia, herpes zoster, and herpes simplex.  
From subjects treated with 200mg, 4.7% developed acne (0% for placebo and 1.6% for 100mg) in the 
PP. It is recognised that Asian subjects could have a higher incidence of acne and nausea. 
The proportion of subjects with elevated (supra-threshold) ALT values, AST values, or total bilirubin in 
the PP and AEP suggest a drug-related increase. Serious liver injuries and 7 potential liver injuries are 
reported in the clinical programme for abrocitinib. Serious injuries were recorded for 100mg treatment 
on Day 85 and 113 (incidences resolved at days 169 and 161, respectively). Potential liver injuries are 
reported for 100 mg and 200 mg treatment (1 and 6 cases, respectively). No incidence of liver-injury 
is reported for placebo treated subjects.  
Three subjects treated with abrocitinib had GI perforations in the All Exposure Pool (AEP; 2 subjects 
treated with 100 mg and 1 subject treated with 200mg) with one serious incidence leading to study 
discontinuation. 
Venous thromboembolism was reported in 5 events; 3 events of PE (all events of pulmonary embolism 
were serious) and 2 events of DVT all in the 200 mg QD group. Although there were few events, IRs of 
VTEs were higher in the AEP compared to all analysed cohorts. Apart from serious infections and VTE, 
Malignancies was included as an AESI. There were 7 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer and 4 events 
of potential malignancy (2 events of prostate cancer and 2 events of ovarian neoplasm) in the clinical 
database at the time of release. Comparisons were made with data from KPNC (Kaiser Permanente) 
and THIN databases. Overall, the IRs for malignancies (excluding NMSC) and NMSC in the KPNC and 
THIN databases were comparable to those seen in the AD clinical programme.  
In non-clinical studies abrocitinib induces effects on bone development and the effect of abrocitinib on 
bone metabolism and bone development in humans is at present not clear. Permanent impact on 
skeletal development cannot be excluded. Abrocitinib exposure on bone development was evaluated 
clinically by HT SDS and fracture rate in children/adolescents >12 years of age. A safety update with

data cut April 2021 was provided by the applicant as part of their D180 LoOI responses. The Full 
Cumulative Pool included 635 adolescents with 646.2 PY. In the April 2021 data there were now 296 
adolescent subjects with height data to Day 360. However, data from the provided April 2021 data 
cuts suggested a potential of a dose-related effect on fractures.  
Finally, data are limited concerning pregnancies exposed to abrocitinib. However, data from preclinical 
studies, available data from other JAK inhibitors, as well as available clinical data for abrocitinib justify 
a contraindication, as depicted in section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
Overall, the demonstrated safety profile of abrocitinib show similarities with other JAK inhibitors. Three 
deaths occurred in the abrocitinib treated subjects but there was no evidence on treatment related 
deaths. Demonstrated key unfavourable effects are haematological abnormalities, virus activation in 
terms of increased percentage of herpes simplex and herpes zoster whereof some serious, VTE and 
possibly pneumonia. The rate of herpes zoster infections was higher in the elderly.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Important uncertainties relate to unfavourable effects of long latency and low frequency. Upon request 
from the CHMP, the applicant committed to update the information presented in the SmPC (where 
necessary) based on an update of safety data from the Full Cumulative Pool (April 2021 data cut) as 
part of a type II variation application (by Q1 2022). 
In non-clinical studies abrocitinib induces effects on bone development and the effect of abrocitinib on 
bone metabolism in humans is not clear. Permanent impact on skeletal development cannot be 
excluded. The indication initially proposed for Cibinqo included children 12-<18 years of age as well as 
adults. Abrocitinib exposure on bone development was evaluated clinically by HT SDS and fracture rate 
in children/adolescents >12 years of age. A safety update with datacut April 2021 was submitted in the 
Day 180 response. The Full Cumulative Pool included 635 adolescents with 646.2 PY. In the April 2021 
data there were now 296 adolescent subjects with height data to Day 360. However, data from the 
provided April 2021 data cuts suggested a potential of a dose-related effect on fractures. Furthermore, 
uncertainties still remained whether the applied clinical measures are sensitive enough to satisfactorily 
provide reassuring data for safe use in children > 12 years of age and the reported data on height SDS 
as well as for fractures was premature for final evaluation. Due to the findings of detrimental effects on 
bone development in preclinical studies and the uncertainties of the relevance of these findings for 
growing adolescents, the treatment indication has been restricted to adults > 18 years of age only.  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Abrocitinib has been shown to cause embryo-
foetal lethality in pregnant rats and rabbits, skeletal variations in the foetuses of pregnant rats and 
rabbits, and to affect parturition and peri/postnatal development in rats (see section 5.3). Cibinqo is 
contraindicated during pregnancy and breast feeding (see section 4.3). Women of reproductive 
potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 month following 
the final dose of Cibinqo. Adequate risk minimisation measures and pharmacovigilance activities are 
included in the RMP to address the risk of foetal malformation following exposure in utero. 
Finally, there are uncertainties regarding long-term safety beyond one year. The long-term effect on 
the risk of developing malignancies is presently unknown. There are also some uncertainties regards 
other events considered as class effects of JAK inhibitors. These concern myopathies (incl. 
rhabdomyolysis), GI-perforation and MACE. Those risks will be followed post approval (see RMP 
section).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important effects noted in the monotherapy studies B7451012 and B7451013 are that 
subjects that well represent the target indication achieved clear or almost clear AD lesions in IGA score 
with abrocitinib 100 mg QD (24-28%) and 200 QD (44-38%) compared with placebo. An even more 
pronounced efficacy was seen for the other co-primary endpoint EASI-75 where 40-44% and 63-61% 
achieved a more than 75% improvement from baseline at week 12 with abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 
200 mg QD, respectively. The clinical efficacy of abrocitinib is dose-dependent with approximately the 
double magnitude of efficacy obtained with 200 mg QD compared with 100 mg QD.  
Furthermore, a combination therapy study has also been performed since the use of medicated topical 
therapy (mostly TCS) is the mainstay of AD treatment. In this study, dupilumab dosed according to 
label was used as the active comparator. The second most important finding is that the efficacy of 
dupilumab overall is like the efficacy of abrocitinib 100 mg QD, while 200 mg QD abrocitinib achieved a 
higher efficacy result in IGA and EASI-75 scores. 
Itch is one of the major symptoms of AD that causes great distress for many patients. Abrocitinib has a 
dose-dependent and statistically significant efficacy on itch when evaluated with the PP-NRS4 score 
after 2 weeks of treatment but could be noted already after a few doses. Abrocitinib 200 mg QD has a 
superior efficacy on itch compared with abrocitinib 100 mg QD and dupilumab for which a similar 
efficacy level was obtained. 
Overall, the clinical efficacy seems robust across subgroups and robust irrespective of different patient 
characteristics, intrinsic or extrinsic factors. 
The dose recommendation has been changed and is now overall accepted.  
The most important uncertainty is triggered by a safety signal from preclinical studies in rats. In these 
non-clinical studies, abrocitinib induces detrimental effects on bone development and the effect of 
abrocitinib on bone metabolism in humans is not clear. Permanent impact on skeletal development 
cannot be excluded. Abrocitinib exposure on bone development was evaluated clinically by HT SDS and 
fracture rate in adolescents >12 years of age. However, data from the provided April 2021 data cut 
suggested a potential of a dose-related effect on fractures and the reported data on height SDS as well 
as for fractures is considered by the CHMP to be premature for final evaluation. Furthermore, 
uncertainties still remain whether the applied clinical measures are sensitive enough to satisfactorily 
provide reassuring data for safe use in children >12 years of age. Consequently, the treatment 
indication has been restricted to adults >18 years of age only. 
Further studies to investigate bone safety in adolescents have been proposed by the applicant. The 
same clinical measures/endpoints will be collected in the proposed safety B7451084 study-please refer 
to the RMP. The applicant also proposed to initiate a sub-study within the frame of the ongoing long-
term extension study B7451015, in order to further investigate potential clinical implications on bone 
development for adolescent subjects >12 years of age that are exposed to abrocitinib. The proposed 
study concept aims for annual MRI images of the knee and is principally supported. These studies will 
be performed post-approval. 
Other demonstrated key unfavourable effects are haematological abnormalities, virus activation in 
terms of increased percentage of herpes simplex and herpes zoster whereof some serious, VTE and 
Assessment report - Cibinqo  
EMA/647846/2021  
   Page 212/216 
 
 
 
 
possibly pneumonia. The rate of herpes zoster infections was higher in the elderly. The knowledge on 
long-term safety is not complete but will be addressed post approval (see RMP section).  
Overall, the impact of the important uncertainties of unfavourable effects of long latency and low 
frequency have been adequately addressed by presently limiting the therapeutic indication to adults 
only and by including appropriate information in the SmPC and RMP.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A statistically significant and dose-dependent efficacy of clinical relevance of abrocitinib 100 mg QD 
and 200 mg QD has been observed in the target population moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The 
proposed therapeutic indication initially reflected the population included in the clinical programme 
performed. Nevertheless, based on pre-clinical findings, there are uncertainties pertaining to potential 
detrimental effects on bone physiology and associated consequences on bone tissue formation and 
maintenance, in particular in growing bone. The clinical studies or the monitoring in these studies were 
likely insensitive to detect adverse events related to bone tissue formation. The therapeutic indication 
is therefore presently limited to adults only. 
Contraindications for pregnancy, breast-feeding, severe hepatic impairment and ongoing serious 
infection (including TB) have been implemented in the product information. Additionally, 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is included as contraindication. 
Other adverse events that pertain mostly to known drug-class effects for JAK inhibitors were also 
recorded, such as haematological changes which could be associated with a higher risk for VTEs and 
infections. Potential effects on cardiovascular safety must be assumed. Those risks will be followed up 
post approval (see RMP section).  
Overall, the exposure of patients to abrocitinib is considered sufficiently sized. The demonstrated 
safety profile of abrocitinib including dose related common adverse events, show similarities with other 
JAK inhibitors and is consistent with the mechanism of action. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Cibinqo is positive in the adult population. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Cibinqo is favourable in the following indication: 
Cibinqo is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy.

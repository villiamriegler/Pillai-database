2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no fully satisfactory cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused 
by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that result in absent or 
deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel 
responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate 
chloride transport in these organs results in the multisystem pathology associated with CF.  
In people with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein result in the accumulation 
of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal 
absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. Lung disease is the 
primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CF affects approximately 44,000 individuals in the EU (ECFS Patient Registry, 2016 Annual Data Report) 
and is considered an orphan disease. Approximately half of the individuals affected by CF are less than 18 
years of age. Data from the mentioned registry corresponding to 2016 show that in some countries there 
is no newborn screening, and that in others, in the five years previous to 2016, almost all the CF patients 
underwent newborn screening. In total, 72% of all children of 5 years old or younger registered in the 
ECFSPR in 2016 underwent newborn screening; however, this estimate reflects the fact that not all the 
countries perform newborn screening. The mean age at diagnosis (in years) was 4.14 with approximately 
half of the patients diagnosed before the age of 0.34 years (around 4 months).  
The F508del is the most frequent mutation in the CF patients. The G551D- CFTR mutation is present in 
1198 alleles (1.40%) and the country with the highest allele prevalence is Ireland (8.78%). The allelic 
frequency is less for other non-G551D gating mutations.   
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The underlying cause of CF, a defect in the gene encoding the CFTR protein, has adverse effects that can 
be observed in newborns and continue to progress through adulthood. The CFTR protein is an epithelial 
chloride channel that aids in regulating salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues. This 
function is defective in patients with CF due to a loss of cell surface expression and/or function of CFTR 
protein. The failure of mutated CFTR protein to regulate chloride transport results in the multisystem 
pathology associated with CF. 
The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride ion (CL-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, 
including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the 
regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. More than 1900 mutations in the CFTR gene have 
been identified.  
CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR function. Stop 
codon mutations (class I) result in a truncated non-functional CFTR, class II mutations consist of 
aberrantly folded CFTR protein that is degraded by the cell quality control system, while class III 
mutations lead to defective regulation of the CFTR protein and, consequently, the absence of CFTR 
function. These three classes usually lead to a classic CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency. CFTR 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 8/73 
 
  
 
 
 
mutations that lead to defective chloride conductance are grouped together in class IV. Class V mutations 
interfere with normal transcription, thereby reducing the amount of otherwise normal CFTR. These latter 
two classes are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease.  
CF causing mutations can be divided into 2 groups based on the extent of loss of chloride transport caused 
by the mutation. A complete or near complete loss of CFTR chloride transport is referred to as “minimal 
function” of CFTR. A less complete loss of CFTR-mediated chloride transport is referred to as “residual 
function” of CFTR. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Since the introduction and continued advances of newborn and antenatal screening, many patients with 
CF are identified through a positive screening test and subsequently diagnosed within the first year of life.  
The diagnosis of CF is usually based on a clinical picture compatible with the disease, and it is confirmed 
by laboratory evidence of abnormal CFTR protein function (a positive sweat test) or by genotyping 
analysis. Loss of lung function is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. However, 
at very young ages clinically apparent lung disease may be absent although lung structural changes may 
be already present and progressing. In children with CF, pancreatic insufficiency and poor nutritional 
status are the most significant clinical manifestations of the disease. It is anticipated that ivacaftor 
treatment in this age range may contribute to slowing disease progression at older ages and to the 
prevention of the negative consequences of CF, such as compromised lung and pancreatic function, 
impaired nutritional status, development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or liver disease. Overall, 
validated endpoints that may help to substantiate whether this is the case are lacking but published 
suggest that early therapeutic intervention is beneficial to young children with CF; studies have 
demonstrated benefits such as improved measures of growth, nutrition, and lung disease through early 
intervention in children diagnosed by newborn screening. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The majority of CF therapies target the symptoms of the disease such as nutritional supplements, 
antibiotics, and mucolytics. CFTR modulators are small molecules that target the functional defect of the 
mutated CFTR protein and therefore they are not intended as a replacement for or an alternative to any 
of the current non-modulator therapies. The goal of therapy is to maintain and restore respiratory 
function.   
Data in the literature suggest that early therapeutic intervention is beneficial to young children with CF; 
studies have demonstrated benefits such as improved measures of growth, nutrition, and lung disease 
through early intervention in children diagnosed by newborn screening.

in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R. 
This extension of the marketing authorisation intends to support an indication expansion for Kalydeco 
(ivacaftor, IVA) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients 6 to <12 months of age who have at least 
1 of the mutations in the CFTR gene that are currently indicated for Kalydeco. 
Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e., in vitro ivacaftor increases CFTR channel gating to 
enhance chloride transport in specified gating mutations with reduced channel-open probability compared 
to normal CFTR.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Study 124 is included in the IVA pediatric investigational plan (PIP) in the EU, and European Medicines 
Agency Paediatric Committee (PDCO) agreed the open-label extension Study 126 would be captured in 
the Kalydeco Risk Management Plan. A Type B meeting with the FDA was held on 05 May 2017, and an 
EMA/Rapporteur presubmission meeting was held on 29 March 2017; Vertex discussed with the FDA and 
the EMA Rapporteur the proposed clinical development of Kalydeco in patients 0 to <24 months of age, 
and the submission plan for the age groups <12 months to support the filing for an indication extension 
based on interim analysis of PK and safety data from 5 patients from each age cohort. In the US, Kalydeco 
was approved for the treatment of children aged 12 to <24 months on 15 August 2018 and Kalydeco was 
approved for treatment of children aged 6 to < 12 months on 29 April 2019. .  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as granules in sachet containing 25 mg of ivacaftor as active substance. 
This new strength is being introduced to support an indication expansion for Kalydeco for the treatment 
of cystic fibrosis (CF) in infants aged at least 6 months, toddlers and children weighting 5 kg to less than 
25 kg who have at least 1 of the mutations in the CFTR gene that are currently indicated for Kalydeco. 
Other ingredients are: colloidal anhydrous silica, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose acetate succinate, 
lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sucralose and sodium lauryl sulfate (E487). 
The product is available in packaged in a biaxially oriented polyethylene 
terephthalate/polyethylene/foil/polyethylene (BOPET/PE/Foil/PE) sachet. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The active substance and its spray-dried dispersion (SDD) used to manufacture ivacaftor 25 mg granules 
in sachet, are identical to those used to manufacture the already approved Kalydeco 150 mg tablets and 
Kalydeco 50 mg and 75 mg granules in sachet. Therefore, no information on the active substance and the 
SDD has been submitted within this line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
EMA/613823/2019

The finished product is an immediate release granule dosage form for oral administration. The ivacaftor 
granules have a diameter of 2.0 mm, a target thickness of 2.1 mm and a target weight of 6.87 mg. Each 
granule contains a target of 1.92 mg of ivacaftor, which is previously formulated as an amorphous SDD 
intermediate. 
The granules are filled by count into the primary container closure (sachet) to achieve the targeted 
strength of ivacaftor per packet. Each sachet is equivalent to one unit dose (25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg).  
For administration, the contents of the packet are emptied and mixed with soft food.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
As indicated above, the active substance and SDD used in the ivacaftor granules 25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg 
and the ivacaftor tablet 150 mg are identical.  
Most of the pharmaceutical development relevant for Kalydeco 25 mg granules was performed for 
Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated tablets and Kalydeco 50 mg and 75 mg granules. All the three granule 
formulations (25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg strengths) are proportional and manufactured from the same 
drug product bulk by filling different amounts into the sachets. 
The dissolution medium and the dissolution conditions (Apparatus 2 –paddles) are the same as for the 50 
mg and 75 mg granules strengths. The dissolution profiles and rates are shown to be independent of 
granule strength.  As shown for the 50 mg and 75 mg granules strengths, the dissolution method is able 
to discriminate against granule formulations with different bioavailability (prototype formulation and 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 11/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Phase 3 granules), different degree of ivacaftor crystallinity, compression pressure and spray-dried 
dispersion bulk density. 
The container closure system for ivacaftor granules is a Biaxially Oriented Polyethylene 
Terephthalate/Polyethylene/Foil/Polyethylene (BOPET/PE/Foil/PE) sachet.  The material complies with 
Ph.Eur. requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and 
is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Kalydeco 25 mg granules is identical to the one of Kalydeco 50 mg and 75 
mg granules, with the exception of the filling step (different number of granules are filled per sachet to 
achieve the different strengths).  
Briefly, the manufacturing process consist of manufacture of the ivacaftor SDD -which comprises mixture 
preparation, spray drying and secondary drying-, followed by blending, compression, and filling.  
The manufacture of a SDD is a non-standard method of manufacture. Since this step of the manufacturing 
process is common to the approved Kalydeco 150 mg tablets, the MAH had extensive experience and 
provided validation data from commercial scale. 
Design spaces were proposed for the following steps of the manufacturing process of the medicinal 
product: spray drying, secondary drying, blending and compression. The robustness of the process was 
verified during validation at commercial scale. The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design 
spaces. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications, are identical to those for the 50 mg and 75 mg granules and 
include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form:  appearance,  identification  (IR),  assay  (HPLC), 
degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), physical form 
(XRPD), water content (Karl Fischer) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.)  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in ivacaftor granules was assessed according to the ICH 
Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities using a risk based approach. The risk assessment considered the 
potential  contributions  from  the  ivacaftor  drug  substance  and  SDD  (including  solvents,  reagents, 
excipients, and equipment), water, granule excipients, and manufacturing equipment to determine the 
overall contribution of elemental impurities to the ivacaftor granules.  
The elemental impurities intentionally added in the ivacaftor drug substance manufacturing process are 
controlled according to ICH Q3D requirements. 
The risk assessment of the content of Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities (as defined in ICH Q3D) 
in  the  ivacaftor  drug  substance  and  SDD  demonstrated  that  the  risk  of  elemental  impurities  in  these 
materials is low. All granule excipients were also shown to comply with ICH Q3D requirements in the 
granules. Testing of representative batches including three commercial batches of drug substance and 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 12/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
SDD from each manufacturer confirmed that the contents of Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities are 
consistently below 30% of the ICH Q3D Option 1 limits.  
This risk assessment and confirmatory testing demonstrates that the risk of elemental impurities in the 
ivacaftor granules is low and the product will consistently meet the ICH Q3D requirements. Therefore, no 
additional controls on elemental impurities are required. 
Batch analysis results were provided for four commercial scale batches of 25 mg granules (three from one 
manufacturer and one from a second manufacturer) confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
The stability studies provided in this application were initiated and presented as part of the application for 
the approved 50 mg and 75 mg granules strengths. A bracketing approach was followed. 
Specifically, stability data from three commercial scale batches of each of the bracketing strengths (25 
mg and 100 mg) manufactured at one of the proposed manufacturing sites and stored for up to 48 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Supportive stability data from three commercial scale batches manufactured at another commercial 
manufacturing site and stored for 3 months at long term and accelerated conditions were also provided. 
The batches of Kalydeco 25 mg granules in sachet are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content, physical 
form and microbial limits.  
All  results  met  the  acceptance  criteria  for  the  attributes  evaluated.  The  stability  data  show  that  the 
finished product is stable when packaged in the configuration proposed for commercial distribution under 
all storage conditions. 
Photostability  per  ICH  Q1B,  Option  2,  was  not  performed  with  ivacaftor  granules  as  the  commercial 
container closure is light protective. 
In-use stability in food was also evaluated to confirm that stability and release of ivacaftor are preserved 
when mixed with food prior to administration. Applesauce, carrot puree, yogurt, infant formula and water 
were  selected  as  representative  foods  as  they  are  commonly  available,  patient  friendly,  and 
demonstrated acceptable sensory attributes.  
Chemical  and  physical  stability  of  granules  mixed  with  food  was  evaluated  by  testing  assay  and 
degradation products, dissolution, and physical form. 
Sachets  of  25  and  100  mg  were  mixed  with  food  and  tested  after  1-hour  contact  time  at  room 
temperature.  
All results met the acceptance criteria for the attributes evaluated.  
The  XRPD  profile  with  infant  formula  was  determined  to  be  due  to  the  formation  of  a  co-crystal  with 
ivacaftor and triglycerides. This was confirmed by spectroscopic analysis and by ultimately comparing the 
XRPD pattern to those of a series of well characterized pure cocrystals. Comparable dissolution profiles in 
quality control and simulated intestinal media, and similar solubility of the triglycerides co-crystals to the 
ivacaftor  SDD,  suggest  that  formation  of  an  ivacaftor-triglyceride  co-crystal  in  food  will  not  have  an 
impact on ivacaftor bioavailability. Overall, the results of the in-use stability in food show that all results 
meet the acceptance criteria. 
EMA/613823/2019

Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  36  months  with  no  storage  conditions  as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the 25 mg granules has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. Most of the pharmaceutical development relevant for Kalydeco 25 mg granules was 
performed for Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated tablets and Kalydeco 50 mg and 75 mg granules. All the three 
granule formulations (25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg strengths) are proportional and manufactured from the 
same drug product bulk by filling different amounts. 
The MAH has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their manufacturing 
process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the manufacture of the finished product. 
The design spaces have been adequately verified. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on TSE safety.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
This  is  a  Line  Extension  Application  to  the  Kalydeco  (Ivacaftor)  Marketing  Authorisation,  in  order  to 
request the addition of a new pharmaceutical strength of one of the existing pharmaceutical forms, that 
is 25 mg granules in sachet, which is proposed to support an Extension of Indication to children aged 6 to 
less than 12 months old who have one of the currently approved gating mutations in the CFTR gene: 
G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R.

2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated ivacaftor ERA (VX-770: Kalydeco Monotherapy and in combination with VX-809 or VX-661 
Environmental  Phase  I  and  II  Risk  Assessment)  was  provided  in  Module  1.6.1  in  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002494/II/63/G  (supportive  Type  II  variation  for  tezacaftor/ivacaftor  combination  regimen 
indication),  which  is  resumed  in  the  following  table.  The  report  provided  a  revised  Fpen  based  on  the 
prevalence of relevant CFTR mutations that ivacaftor is prescribed for in Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symkevi. 
The Fpen was refined by mutation only and was not restricted by age, thereby incorporating the proposed 
Kalydeco monotherapy indication extension. 
The Phase II Tier B assessments of ivacaftor are ongoing and the Applicant states that the final ivacaftor 
ERA (Kalydeco monotherapy) will be available and submitted to the European Medicines Agency at a later 
stage.

2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable apart 
from the studies of updated ERA. The ERA for ivacaftor is being revised, with new experimental studies 
conducted and planned to assess the impact of ivacaftor in the environment which will be submitted in 
due  course.  Final  ivacaftor  ERA  will  refer  to  monotherapy  medicinal  products  (Kalydeco  150  mg 
film-coated  tablets  and  Kalydeco  25  mg,  50  mg  and  75  mg  granules)  and  to  combination  therapy 
(Orkambi 100 mg/125 mg film-coated tablets and Orkambi 200 mg/125 mg film-coated tablets, Symkevi 
100 mg/150 mg film coated tablets). This is accepted by the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The data submitted in the non-clinical part of the dossier are acceptable for this type of application.

•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor in the target age group from 6 to less than 12 months of age was 
investigated in Study 124 which is an ongoing, two-part study, with part A assessing mainly PK and part 
B (24 weeks) assessing safety and efficacy. In Part A, ivacaftor 25 mg (children aged 6 to less than 12 
months and weighing 5 to < 7 kg) or 50 mg (children aged 6 to less than 12 months and weighing 7 to < 
14 kg) as granules was administered twice daily for a total of 7 doses to obtain steady-state 
concentrations. The proposed dosing recommendations in section 4.2 of the SmPC would theoretically 
allow dosing children aged 6 to less than 12 months and weighing ≥ 14 kg to less than 25 Kg with 
ivacaftor 75 mg BID.  A 14-kg body weight is above the 97th percentile for the oldest children in the age 
range from 6 to less than 12 months according to the WHO weight-for-age growth charts.  Although CF is 
commonly associated with undernutrition, the proportion of overweight and obese individuals is 
increasing. 
In Study 124, ivacaftor granules were mixed with approximately 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of appropriate liquid 
or soft food and administered with an age-appropriate fat-containing meal or snack. This method of 
administration is in line with the recommendations to administer ivacaftor 150 mg tablets. This is 
endorsed as the magnitude of food effect for the final granule formulation is similar to that of the 150-mg 
tablet when administered with a high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions. In Part B, the dose could be 
adjusted if needed based on Part A results but all subjects received 50 mg BID.   
PK data was available from both parts, from Part A/Cohort 2 (6 subjects, 24 PK observations) and from 
Part B/Cohort 6 (11 subjects, 82 PK observations) as well. Cohorts 2 and 6 enrolled patients who are six 
to less than twelve months of age. In Cohort 2, 1 subject received 25 mg IVA q12h. In the 50-mg IVA 
q12h group, there were 5 subjects. In Part B, a total of 11 subjects were enrolled (including 3 subjects 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 17/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
who participated also in Part A). At Day 1, all subjects weighed 7 to <14 kg (range: 7.8 to 10.7 kg) and 
therefore received IVA 50 mg q12h.  
Plasma concentrations of IVA and metabolites, M1-IVA and M6-IVA, were analysed by descriptive 
statistics. PK analysis of IVA for comparison of IVA disposition to that of adults was conducted as 
described within the Population PK report (Report O290) via nonlinear mixed effects modeling with the 
nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) software. 
Analytical methods: The analytical method validations for the determination of M1, and M6 in K2EDTA and 
K3EDTA were already assessed in prior procedures. There were three analytical methods used in the 
clinical studies that were already assessed in the previous assessment reports. The results of the 
cross-validation and transfers experiments determined that data were comparable between the three 
laboratories where data on plasma concentrations were generated. All original samples analyzed within 
the 446 days demonstrated long-term storage stability in human plasma containing K2EDTA at -80 ºC ± 
10 ºC. 
The in-study validation for each analyte shows acceptable calibration standards and QCs and the reasons 
for the reanalysis of samples are acceptable for each analytes (above ULOQ and one sample due to 
unacceptable internal standard response) for VRT-842917. The ISR was performed in a total of 31 
samples for each analyte. For the samples reanalysed, the ISR was acceptable as 90.3% (28 samples out 
of 31 samples) of the samples reanalysed were within the acceptance range (± 20%). 
Bioavailability and food effect:A new dose strength, i.e., ivacaftor 25 mg granules is proposed to dose 
children aged 6 to less than 12 months  and weighing at least 5 kg to less than 7 kg. The comparative 
bioavailability and food effect have been investigated with the 150 mg dose (2x75 mg) in studies 012 and 
015 (assessed in EMEA/H/C/002494/X/0034/G). The conclusions regarding bioavailability and food effect 
can be extrapolated to the 25 mg strength because the formulations are qualitatively identical, 
quantitatively proportional, the same manufacturing method is used, and ivacaftor PK is linear. In 
addition, the dissolution profiles of both strengths should be similar. A question has been included in the 
quality part of this report in this respect. These investigations were conducted with the highest 
strengths/doses (worst case scenario) as required in the guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence 
and the guideline on interactions. 
As the magnitude of food effect for the final granule formulation is similar to that of the 150-mg tablet 
when administered with a high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions, the proposed dosage and 
administration recommendations for the granule formulation are the same as for the film-coated tablets, 
i.e., they are to be administered with fat-containing food, the same as Kalydeco 150-mg tablets. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target paediatric population: The doses for the 6 to <12 month cohort in Study 
124 were selected based on simulations conducted using a previously developed population PK model that 
included data from subjects 1 through 5 years of age. The primary objective of Part A/Cohort 2 of study 
124 was to evaluate the PK of ivacaftor and metabolites M1-IVA and M6-IVA at the doses selected in 
infants and toddlers with cystic fibrosis who were <24 months of age at treatment initiation and have a 
CFTR gating mutation.  
Ivacaftor metabolite concentrations were determined but they are not incorporated in the model or their 
values further discussed with respect to those of older age groups. Plots of observed plasma 
concentrations of metabolites M1 and M6 over time in children aged 6 to less than 12 months were 
provided and compared to those of adult subjects and children aged 6 to less than 12 years old dosed with 
ivacaftor 150 mg BID. While the observed M1 plasma concentrations are mostly within the range of values 
that have been observed in adults and children, for M6 2 infants had observed plasma concentrations 
higher than 6000 ng/ml (almost the double of the concentrations observed in the remaining infants 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 18/73 
 
  
 
 
 
enrolled in Part A/Cohort 2) which are above the range of values observed in these two older age groups. 
No remarkable adverse events were reported for these two infants.      
Ivacaftor metabolites are not included in the pop-PK model given that prior attempts to develop an 
integrated population PK model were not successful as parameter estimates for the metabolite models 
were not physiologically reasonable and with unrealistic relationships between body size and volume of 
distribution. Therefore, the pop-PK analysis only characterise ivacaftor exposure as the key driver of 
efficacy. This has been accepted for prior procedures. Regarding the consequences of possible genetic 
polymorphisms, at the time of assessment of MAA of Symkevi, the MAH committed to characterise 
post-authorisation the systemic exposure to ivacaftor and tezacaftor in subjects with the variant 
CYP3A4*22 in comparison with wild-type CYP3A4.  A study has been completed assessing the systemic 
exposure to ivacaftor and tezacaftor in subjects with the variant CYP3A4*22 in comparison with subjects 
with 2 copies of the wild-type CYP3A4 allele.  No subjects were homozygous for CYP3A4*22 and therefore 
it cannot be excluded that exposure in such patients is increased to a larger extent than in the 
heterozygous population. The lack of data in this population is reflected in section 5.2 of the Kalydeco 
SmPC. 
The MAH has calculated the intra-subject variability of the granules based on the residual variability of the 
cross-over study 015, where healthy adult volunteers were enrolled. The real intra-subject variability 
could not be estimated because the design is not a replicate design. However, the residual variability is an 
acceptable alternative. The estimated intra-subject variability expressed as coefficient of variation (CV, 
%) was 15%, 15%, and 24% for AUC0-∞, AUC0-tlast, and Cmax respectively. The MAH was also requested to 
estimate the intra-subject and inter-subject variability in the target paediatric population and provide the 
percent coefficient variation (%CV) for Cmin,ss and AUC,ss in children aged 6 to less than 12 months 
based on the pop-PK analysis. This has been done based (apparently) on Model 2 (see further below).  
Inter and intrasubject variability in AUCss was 46% and 20% respectively, while for Cmin,ss these values 
were 60% and 23%. The MAH was requested to explain how these low values of intra-individual variability 
have been calculated. It has been clarified that they were calculated using model-predicted exposures 
from empirical Bayes estimates (EBEs). Due to the small sample size and the limited availability of blood 
samples in these young subjects the values (both inter- and intra-subject variability) should be viewed 
with caution. 
Population-PK analysis: Plasma concentrations of IVA and metabolites, M1-IVA and M6-IVA, were 
analysed by descriptive statistics but PK analysis of IVA for comparison of IVA disposition to that of adults 
was conducted via nonlinear mixed effects modelling. The population PK model supporting dosing 
recommendations for children aged at least 6 months to less than 12 months includes data from 
paediatric patients (from less to 18 years down to 3 months of age). This pop-PK modelling and simulation 
study with PK paediatric-only data was initially developed to support dosing recommendations of ivacaftor 
for children aged 12 to less than 24 months. The PK data set consisted at that time of 197 subjects (which 
already included data from the 6 children aged 6 to less than 12 months enrolled in Part A/Cohort 2). This 
model has been updated with data from the 11 subjects enrolled in Part B/Cohort 6 as well as with data 
from 6 subjects enrolled in Part A, Cohort 3 (aged 3 to less than 6 months).  
A two-compartment model with zero-order delivery to the absorption compartment and subsequent 
first-order absorption was chosen as the ivacaftor structural model, with weight as an allometric function 
affecting the disposition parameters. After the initial fitting, an attempt of model refinement was made 
which included testing different models. Covariate models to account for age, sex, patient status (healthy 
volunteers versus patients with cystic fibrosis), and non-white race did not explain the variability in 
ivacaftor PK in a meaningful manner in adults and paediatric subjects two years of age and older. Race 
was not expected to have any impact due to the fact that all children were White. Most of them were 
female. Therefore, only body weight (with fixed allometric relationships) and age as a marker of 
maturation were considered as covariates for the analysis. 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 19/73 
 
  
 
 
 
A model to describe the effects of age on ivacaftor clearance was investigated by incorporating a 
maturation function driven by post-menstrual age (PMA) which did not improve the fit of the model. As a 
consequence, this effect was not retained into the model and dosing recommendations proposed for 
section 4.2 of the SmPC (including in case of moderate hepatic impairment as well as in case of 
concomitant administration with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors) are weight-based for children 
weighing at least 5 kg to less than 25 kg (for which the corresponding ages are approximately 2 months 
to 8 years of a healthy same-age population of reference). However, neither numerical nor graphical 
information was initially submitted to show how the different models tested performed. The MAH was 
requested to provide a list of all models tested as well as the rationale for the model development 
procedure, including the numerical and graphical evaluation that supported the MAH’s choice of the final 
model. Information on the models tested was discussed in response to the major objection and data 
regarding the process followed in report O290 (the initial pop-PK report submitted supporting current 
dosing recommendations) were provided. A summary table including the model description and the 
objective function value of each of the models tested as well as diagnostic plots with the loess smooth 
lines when applicable and stratified by body weight and age have been provided.  The data provided 
support to the choice of the model with fixed exponent allometric scaling, and no maturation among the 
models initially tested and prior to the update with PK data from children less than 6 months of age (see 
further below). The diagnostic plot of ETA1-CL/F versus Age including the loess smooth line shows a trend 
on Cl/F over the studied age range (i.e., decreasing clearance with increasing age which was an 
unexpected finding).       
Model-based predicted ivacaftor Cmin,ss and AUC,ss values in six to eleven month old subjects for the 50 
mg dose group were similar to those of adults administered 150 mg BID ivacaftor. There was only one 
subject weighing less than 7 kg who was administered ivacaftor 25 mg BID for 4 days and even though 
the predicted exposure for this patient was within the adult range too, the influence of CYP3A maturation 
on ivacaftor clearance could not be excluded based on these very limited data from younger patients.  
Additional data were requested by CHMP for patients under 7 kg to evaluate the adequacy of the 
population pharmacokinetic model in estimating individual PK parameters for subjects under 7 kg of 
bodyweight.  In addition, model-based simulations also showed that some patients aged 6 to less than 12 
months and weighting at least 7 to less than 14 kg could have AUCss values exceeding the maximum 
observed AUC values in adults (approximately 30000 ng/mL•h) when dosed at 50 mg. This was also of 
concern considering that dosing recommendations for children with (moderate or severe) hepatic 
impairment or receiving concomitant treatment with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are based on 
the conclusion from the initially developed population PK modelling and simulation analysis that there was 
minimal or no influence of CYP3A maturation on ivacaftor clearance. As a consequence, the MAH was 
requested to update the pop-PK model with the available PK data of children treated in study 124 
(including children below 6 months of age and/or weighing less than 5 kg as Study 124 is ongoing 
enrolling younger age cohorts) and based on this updated model, to simulate the exposure of different 
dosing regimens per age and bodyweight groups (including, but not limited to, the dose of 25 mg for 
children aged 6 to less than 12 months of age and weighing ≥ 7 kg to less than 14 kg and for children 
weighing less than 7 kg) to compare the exposure distributions for each individual age and bodyweight 
group. 
In response to the Major Objection, the MAH updated the pop-PK model above discussed with data from 
6 subjects aged 3 to <6 months of age enrolled in Cohort 3 (Part A of study 124). Three of these infants 
received ivacaftor 25 mg BID (body weight below 7 kg) and the remaining 3 received 50 mg BID. Their 
body weight and length range from 5.3 to 8.1 kg and from 59.0 to 68.1 cm, respectively. Their 
weight-for-length z-scores and percentiles ranged from -2.83 to 0.73 and from 0 to 77 respectively. A 
child who received 25 mg IVA presented plasma concentrations of ivacaftor and metabolite M1 well above 
the maximum observed concentrations in the remaining children in this cohort, with values at least two 
EMA/613823/2019

times higher. Plasma concentrations of M6-IVA were the highest observed ones. The weight-for length 
z-score and percentile was -2.83 and 0 respectively, which is indicative of wasting.      
Not only was the prior model (fixed exponent allometric scaling, and no maturation, Model 1) updated 
with the above mentioned PK data (Model 2, a two-compartment disposition with allometric scaling on 
body weight and no maturation), but also some additional models were run by the MAH, i.e. Model 3 
which implemented a maturation function driven by post-menstrual age and Model 4 which implemented 
an empirical Emax structure for weight effect and a maturation function. Regarding Model 4, it is stated 
that this model was run with and without maturation effect but no details were provided on the model 
without maturation effect. This was done and a fifth model (M5) was discussed which is an empirical 
model (as Model 4) without maturation. This model performed worse than Model 4 in terms of the 
objective function value, precision of the estimated parameters and predictions. A base model, which 
includes no age (maturation) or weight effects was also run to have a base model with the same data set 
(Model 1b) used in the previous mentioned models (Model 2-Model 5). 
Selected diagnostic plots and model-based simulations have been provided for each of the 5 models 
discussed in responses to the CHMP. Based on all the presented diagnostic plots stratified by body weight 
and age, including VPCs and corrected VPCs as well as precision in parameter estimates, it can be 
concluded that Model 4 fits the data for children 6 to less than 12 months of age reasonably well.    
Given the young age of children enrolled in Cohorts 2 and Cohorts 6 of study 124 and the involvement of 
CYP3A4 in the metabolism of ivacaftor (and metabolite M1), Cl/F and Vc/F values were plotted vs. age and 
weight. As previously said, the plot showing CL versus age showed a trend of apparent decrease of 
clearance with increasing age from 6 months up to 6 years which was unexpected. The diagnostic plots of 
ETA 1 vs. weight and age presented in response to the day 180 MO confirm that Model 4 is the one 
producing the best fit.  It is therefore concluded that all data provided support the inclusion of both 
maturation and weight effects in the empirical model (Model 4) to capture trends in CL/F over the full age 
range and provide the best goodness of fit. Simulations of expected exposures for different dosing 
regimens per body weight bands for children aged 6 to less than 12 months were generated based on 
Model 2 and Model 4 including a dose of 15 mg for children weighing less than 7 kg as requested (see 
Figure below) showing that this dose may result in underexposure which is more pronounced when Model 
2 is used.

Figure 1 Simulation of IVA AUC0-12hr at Steady-State for the Different Dosing Regimens for 
the Paediatric Population 6 to <12 Months of Age 
Overall, these predictions are reassuring for the proposed doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg BID for 
children weighing at least 5 kg to less than 7 kg, for those weighing 7 kg to less than 14 kg and for those 
in the weight band from ≥ 14 kg to less than 25 kg, respectively when considering that simulations of 
exposures resulting from these regimens are consistent to those of older subjects and are not anticipated 
to exceed the maximum observed AUC values in adults (approximately 30000 ng/mL × h).  
No attempt has been made during simulations to explore the effect of moderate hepatic impairment or the 
coadministration of ivacaftor with CYP3A4 moderate or strong inhibitors on the predicted ivacaftor 
exposures.  Even though it has been concluded that the inclusion of both maturation and weight effects in 
the empirical model (Model 4) best captures the trend in CL/F over the full age range and provide the best 
goodness of fit, this has no impact on dosing recommendations with respect to the initial proposal. The 
simulations based on Model 2 (fixed exponent allometric scaling, no maturation) and Model 4 (empirical 
with maturation effect) would lead to the same dosing recommendations as currently proposed. The main 
difference seems to be that in the lighter children the predicted ivacaftor exposures are higher when 
Model 4 is used. Overall, it appears that the contribution of the maturation effect on CL is not as relevant 
as that of body weight.  
Special populations: Of the covariates tested in the pop-PK study including PK data from children aged 6 
to less than 12 months of age enrolled in Cohort 2/Part A and Cohort 6/Part B of Study 124 only body 
weight (with fixed allometric relationships) and age as a marker of maturation were considered as 
covariates for the analysis. A maturation function driven by post-menstrual age (PMA) was implemented 
in the pop-PK model to account for CYP3A4 maturation but as the fit of the model did not improve the 
effect of age was not retained in the final model on which these simulations were based. As sated above, 
even though it has been concluded that the inclusion of both maturation and weight effects in the 
empirical model (Model 4) best captures the trend observed in CL/F over the full age range and provide 
the best goodness of fit, this has no impact on dosing recommendations with respect to the initial 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 22/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
proposal. Therefore, the same dosing recommendations as initially proposed are kept on the basis that 
the systemic exposure for the 6 to <12 month population is accurately predicted by the updated model 
and consistent with exposures in older age groups including adults. Additionally, the MAH state that 
post-marketing experience to date in all age groups has not identified any issues with the current 
recommended guidance for patients with hepatic impairment. 
The recommended dose for patients 6 to <12 months with moderate hepatic impairment is similar to the 
recommendation for patients 12 months to <6 years old with moderate hepatic impairment, but is 
adjusted for the smaller size of the 6 to <12 month old patients: 
- 
- 
6 to <12 months and ≥5 to <7 kg: one 25-mg sachet/packet of granules qd 
6 to <12 months and ≥7 to <14 kg: one 50-mg sachet/packet of granules qd 
For patients with mild hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is needed while in children with severe 
hepatic impairment use of IVA is not recommended unless the benefits outweigh the risks. In such case, 
the starting dose should be 1 sachet/packet of granules qd or less frequently. Dosing intervals should be 
modified according to the clinical response and tolerability which are basically the same recommendations 
as for older paediatric subjects and adults.   
At the present time and even taken into account the current acceptance of the proposed posology for 
infants aged 6 to less than 12 months without hepatic damage, some concerns remain regarding the use 
of ivacaftor at the proposed doses in subjects with hepatic impairment as this was an exclusion criterion. 
Upon request, the MAH included a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC to highlight that there are no safety 
data in children aged 6 to less than 12 months of age with moderate or severe hepatic impairment when 
treated with ivacaftor as recommended in section 4.2 of the SmPC. The MAH clarified however that the 
available post-marketing data in patients with hepatic impairment treated with ivacaftor as recommended 
in the SmPC were reassuring.   
For subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment no dose adjustment is needed as there was minimal 
elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine in a mass balance study. Caution is recommended in 
case of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. This seems acceptable. The median (range) 
gestational age at delivery of infants enrolled in Part B/Cohort 6 was 39.0 weeks (37, 41), i.e., all of them 
were born at term. Given that these children were at least 6 months of age at enrolment in Cohort 2 and 
Cohort 6 it can be assumed that at that time renal maturation is advanced. 
Interactions: The recommended IVA dose for patients 6 to <12 months is 25 mg (5 to <7 kg) and 50 mg 
(7 to <14 kg) twice weekly during concomitant dosing with strong CYP3A inhibitors and 25 mg (5 to <7 
kg) and 50 mg (7 to <14 kg) once daily during concomitant dosing with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 
The basis for such recommendations is the same as described above, i.e., the impact of CYP maturation 
on IVA disposition in this age group is minimal. The fact that both, the age and the weight should be taken 
into account, does not have any impact on the dosing recommendations on the same basis as explained 
above, i.e., that the systemic exposure for the 6 to <12 month population is accurately predicted by the 
updated model and consistent with exposures in older age groups including adults. Upon request of the 
CHMP, the MAH included a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC to highlight that there are no safety data 
in children aged 6 to less than 12 months of age when treated with ivacaftor as recommended in section 
4.2 of the SmPC given that the prior (within a defined time frame) or concomitant use of CYP3A4 
inhibitors was an exclusion criterion. 
It has also been clarified that IVA and its metabolites are BCRP substrates. While the co-administration of 
BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter the exposure of IVA and M1-IVA meaningfully due to their high 
intrinsic permeability and elimination via CYP3A catalysed metabolism, plasma concentrations of M6-IVA 
may be increased due to its low passive permeability and potential transporter-mediated clearance. 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 23/73 
 
  
 
 
 
However, the MAH states that the potential increase in M6-IVA exposures with BCRP inhibitors (such as 
cyclosporin) is not expected to be clinically relevant as available literature suggest that BCRP inhibition 
can potentially increase exposures of sensitive substrates by approximately 2- to 3-fold, which is within 
the ~2- to 5-fold exposure range seen in subjects in the IVA Phase 3 studies. This information is included 
in the SmPC of Kalydeco. Hepatic BCRP is expressed early during human development and does not 
undergo major relevant developmental changes after term birth.     
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation: The highest ivacaftor exposure that has been observed in the 
paediatric population corresponds to children aged 6 to less than 12 years of age who were dosed with 
150 mg BID. The predicted mean (SD) AUC,ss and Cmin,ss in this age group is 20000 (8330) ng•h/mL 
and 1240 (594) ng/ml, respectively. This level of exposure was demonstrated to be safe and efficacious 
in this age group in clinical trials. Age (maturation) is not relevant for children aged 6 years and older 
patients as CYP3A4 maturation is complete. However, the degree of uncertainty in children aged 6 to less 
than 12 months of age is greater as the conclusions of Model 4 suggest that both body weight and age 
should be taken into consideration. The simulations based on Model 2 (fixed exponent allometric scaling, 
no maturation) and Model 4 (empirical with maturation effect) would lead to the same dosing 
recommendations as currently proposed. The main difference seems to be that in the lighter children the 
predicted ivacaftor exposures are higher when Model 4 is used for simulations of predicted exposure. In 
study 003 (moderate hepatic impairment), the AUC0-∞ for total and unbound ivacaftor was approximately 
2-fold higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than in matched healthy subjects. Total and 
unbound AUC0-∞ of ivacaftor metabolites, M1 and M6 were approximately 1.5- to 1.7-fold higher in 
moderate hepatic impairment subjects than in matched healthy subjects. Co-administration with 
ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased ivacaftor AUC by 8.5-fold and increased M1 to a lesser 
extent than ivacaftor.    
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new data have been provided regarding the mechanism of action and primary/secondary 
pharmacology and this is acceptable for this type of application. The pharmacodynamic profile of Kalydeco 
is already well described.     
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new data have been provided regarding the mechanism of action and primary/secondary 
pharmacology. This is considered acceptable to the CHMP since the pharmacology of ivacaftor is well 
known. The underlying cause of CF and the mechanism of action of ivacaftor are the same regardless of 
the age of the subjects with cystic fibrosis considered. In vitro data on the pre-specified CFTR gating 
mutations covered by this extension of the indication have been discussed in the frame of previous 
procedures. No attempts have been done to implement PD markers such as sweat chloride in the 
population model given the limited number of children enrolled in Part B (n=11) with only 6 children 
having completed data, i.e., baseline and Week 24 data. A request was made to incorporate sweat 
chloride data at the time of assessment of the extension of the indication to children aged 12 to less than 
24 months but there was insufficient information to develop a linear or nonlinear exposure-response 
model.  This was however accepted by CHMP and therefore no request in this sense is made in the present 
procedure. Dose finding is therefore based on targeting the adult dose that has been shown to be 
efficacious in the pivotal studies in older paediatric subjects and adult subjects. This is acceptable but the 
initial population PK model selected to support dosing recommendations for children below 12 months of 
age did not take into account any influence of CYP3A4 maturation on ivacaftor clearance. Given that only 
a single child in Part A/Cohort 2 had been dosed with 25 mg BID, the MAH was requested  to update the 
model with PK data of younger children (below 6 months of age and/or below 5 kg of body weight) and to 
further discuss the potential influence of CYP3A4 maturation on ivacaftor clearance. This request was 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 24/73 
 
  
 
 
 
fulfilled and additional models were developed and discussed. Of these, an empirical model with 
maturation function is the one that best describes the observed PK data in infants aged 6 to less than 12 
months of age. In spite of the fact that both maturation (age) and body weight should be taken into 
account, the contribution of each one seems to be different with body weight apparently being most 
relevant. The simulations based on Model 2 (fixed exponent allometric scaling, no maturation) and Model 
4 (empirical with maturation effect) would lead to the same dosing recommendations as currently 
proposed. The main difference seems to be that in the lighter children the predicted ivacaftor exposures 
are higher when Model 4 is used. Therefore, it is considered that this issue is solved.  However, concerns 
still remain regarding dosing recommendations for infants aged 6 to less than 12 months with hepatic 
impairment or receiving concomitant administration with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and thus,  
the MAH was requested to add a cautionary sentence in section 4.4 of the SmPC to highlight that no safety 
data are available in infants aged 6 to less than 12 months of age in the above situations. This is 
considered adequate to the CHMP. In addition, the section 4.5 of the SmPC of Kalydeco was also updated 
with the information on its potential to interact with transporters. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is 
not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Ivacaftor and its metabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro. 
Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact, co-administration of 
BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of ivacaftor and M1 IVA, while any potential changes in 
M6 IVA exposures are not expected to be clinically relevant. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The conclusion of the updated pop-PK modelling is that CYP34 maturation has an effect on ivacaftor 
clearance. In spite of this, dose is weight-based given that the influence of age on ivacaftor clearance 
appears limited in the group of children aged 6 to less than 12 months of age when compared to body 
weight. This effect of age will continue to be assessed in children below 6 months of age. The SmPC of 
Kalydeco has been updated with the relevant information for the prescriber. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study and main study 
Study VX15-770-124  
A Phase 3, 2-Part, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of 
Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Who Are Less Than 24 Months of Age at Treatment Initiation and 
Have a CFTR Gating Mutation 
Methods 
Study 124 is an ongoing Phase 3, 2-part, open-label study of orally administered IVA in subjects with CF 
who were <24 months of age at treatment initiation (Day 1) and have a CFTR gating mutation or R117H 
(currently in the US only) on at least 1 allele. The present analysis of data from study 124 corresponds to 
the Interim Analysis 2 Report which includes all data from subjects 6 to less than 12 months of age who 
completed Cohort 2/Part A and/or Cohort 6/Part B (through 24 weeks of treatment). 
Study 124 is a two-part study. Part A was designed to evaluate the safety and PK of multiple-dose 
administration of IVA over 4 days of dosing, and to confirm (or adjust if necessary) the doses for Part B. 
Part B was designed to evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and efficacy of IVA in subjects over 24 weeks. The 
study is ongoing as younger subjects are being enrolled in subsequent descending age cohorts of the 
study following PK and safety assessments for each age cohort, as follows:  
•  Cohort 1: subjects aged 12 to <24 months  
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 25/73 
 
  
 
 
 
•  Cohort 2: subjects aged 6 to <12 months 
•  Cohort 3: subjects aged 3 to <6 months 
•  Cohort 4: subjects aged 0 to <3 months 
Subjects will be enrolled in Part B sequentially in the following cohorts based on age at Day 1 of Part B: 
•  Cohort 5: subjects aged 12 to <24 months 
•  Cohort 6: subjects aged 6 to <12 months 
•  Cohort 7: subjects aged 0 to <6 months 
During the treatment periods of Parts A and B, 25 mg (for subjects 5 to <7 kg on Day 1), 50 mg (for 
subjects 7 to <14 kg on Day 1), or 75 mg (for subjects ≥14 to <25 kg on Day 1) IVA was to be 
administered every 12 hours (q12h). Part A consisted of a Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1), a 
Treatment Period (Day 1 to Day 5), a Follow-up Telephone Call (Day 14), and a Follow-up Ophthalmologic 
Examination (OE, 8 weeks after the last dose). Part B consisted of a Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1), 
a Treatment Period (Day 1 to Week 24), a Follow-up Visit (4 weeks after the last dose), and a Follow-up 
OE (24 weeks after the last dose). Figure below shows the basic study design.  
Figure 2 Schematic of study design 
All subjects who completed 24 weeks of study drug treatment in Part B were eligible to enrol in the 
open-label treatment arm of an extension study (Study 126). Subjects who completed 24 weeks of study 
drug treatment who did not enrol in the treatment arm of Study 126 were required to complete the 
Follow-up Visit (4 weeks ± 7 days after the last dose of study drug) and were eligible to enrol in the 
observational arm of Study 126.

Treatments 
In Part A, IVA was administered every 12 hours (q12h) for 3 days with the last dose of study drug being 
administered the morning dose on Day 4 (7 total doses) to obtain steady-state concentrations of IVA. In 
Part B, at each study visit, the IVA dose for each subject was reassessed based on body weight and 
adjusted if necessary. For Cohorts 2 and 6, IVA granules were administered orally at a dosage of 25, 50 
or 75 mg q12h based on weight. In Part A, doses administered from the evening dose on Day 1 through 
the evening dose on Day 3 were administered q12h at home, and the Day 1 and Day 4 morning dose was 
administered in the clinic. On Day 1 of Part B, subjects received a single dose of 25, 50 mg or 75 mg IVA, 
or other suitable starting dose based on PK data from Part A (by weight) in the clinic. At each study visit, 
the IVA dose for each subject was reassessed based on body weight and adjusted if necessary. For Cohort 
6, all subjects received 50 mg IVA based on their weight for the duration of the 24-week treatment period. 
Each dose of granules was mixed with approximately 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of appropriate liquid or soft food 
and administered with an age-appropriate fat-containing meal or snack.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Assessment of the safety of IVA treatment in subjects with CF who are less than 2 years of age and have 
a CFTR gating mutation was a primary objective of Parts A and B. For PK endpoints, refer to PK section. 
Primary safety endpoints: 
• AEs 
• Clinical laboratory values (hematology and serum chemistry) 
• OEs 
• Physical examinations 
• Standard 12-lead ECGs 
• Vital signs 
Pharmacodynamic endpoint (Part B only): sweat chloride test (measured as absolute change from 
baseline) 
Tertiary and exploratory efficacy endpoints (Part B only): 
•  Absolute change from baseline for the following: 
o  Weight 
o 
Length 
o  Weight-for-length 
o  Weight-for-age z-score 
o 
Length-for-age z-score 
o  Weight-for-length-for-age z-score 
o 
Lung clearance index (LCI) at qualified study sites (based on training and availability of 
mass spectrometry Multiple Breath Washout [MBW] analysis). (Note: MBW was optional 
and performed only on subjects for whom additional or separate informed consent was 
obtained)

vital capacity (FVC) from the raised-volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression 
(RVRTC) only at qualified sites. (Note: these tests were optional and were to be 
performed only on subjects for whom additional or separate informed consent was 
obtained for the procedures. Only 1 site was identified globally). 
o  Markers of pancreatic function and inflammation, i.e., Faecal elastase-1 (FE-1) and 
Immunoreactive trypsin and/or trypsinogen (IRT) (Note: the assay used in study 108 [in 
children aged 2 to less than 6 years with pre-specified CFTR gating mutations], which was 
discontinued by the manufacturer, only measured trypsinogen whereas the assay used in 
Study 124 measures both trypsin and trypsinogen resulting in a broader quantification 
window). In addition, although lipase and amylase levels were collected as part of safety 
assessments, the results were included under efficacy because they are useful indicators 
of pancreatic inflammation.

•  CF-related hospitalizations 
•  Acceptability/palatability of ivacaftor granules 
Randomisation 
Not applicable, as this was a single-treatment-arm study and an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Study 124 is still ongoing.  The sample size was based on the availability of the subject population and PK 
analysis considerations, and not on any statistical consideration. Therefore, the study is not powered to 
detect a significant treatment effect.  Continuous variables (analysed as the absolute change from 
baseline to the post-baseline value) and categorical variables were summarized by standard descriptive 
statistics. Incomplete/missing data were not imputed, unless specified otherwise. 
Three analysis set were defined as follows: 
- 
The All Subjects Set was defined separately for Parts A and B as all subjects who were eligible for 
study enrolment or received at least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set was used for all individual 
subject data listings and the disposition summary table. 
- 
- 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) for Part B was defined as all subjects who were eligible for study 
enrolment and received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
The Safety Set was defined separately for Parts A and B as all subjects who received at least 1 dose 
of study drug. The Safety Set was used for all safety analyses, with subjects analyzed according to 
the treatment they received, unless specified otherwise.

Recruitment 
The study recruitment started in March 2016 and is ongoing. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations: There were 3 protocol deviations in 3 subjects that were identified as important 
protocol deviations (IPDs). After review of these deviations, it was determined that 2 of the 3 deviations 
did not compromise interpretation of the study results or significantly affect the subject’s rights, safety, or 
well-being, as summarised below: 
−  One  subject  was  deemed  eligible  based  on  normal  LFTs  at  the  Screening  Visit.  The  subject 
received first study dose of IVA 50-mg in February 2018. On  May 2018, the site was alerted to an 
historical ALT elevation of 160 U/L (ALT >3 to ≤5 × ULN) that occurred in November 2017, which 
would have met exclusion criterion 4 (AST and ALT levels were normal). This LFT elevation was 
reviewed by the principal investigator (PI) and was considered not clinically relevant to the study. 
No LFT elevations were observed during the 24-week treatment period. The sponsor determined 
that there had not been any safety concerns while the subject had been receiving IVA and this IPD 
did not affect interpretation of study results. 
-  Other  two  protocol  deviations  were  related  to  study  procedures  and  assessments  and  were 
considered  not  to  compromise  interpretation  of  the  study  results  or  significantly  affect  the 
subject’s rights, safety, or well-being.

Table 7 Medical History That Occurred in At Least 2 Subjects, Safety Set, Part B/Cohort 6 
Prior  and  concomitant  medication:  The  most  commonly  reported  concomitant  medications  were 
pancreatin  (72.7%),  sodium  chloride  (63.3%),  amoxicillin  (45.5%),  and  paracetamol  (45.5%). 
Pancreatic  enzyme  replacement  therapy  (pancreatin  or  pancrelipase)  was  reported  for  9  (81.8%) 
subjects. 
Numbers analysed 
The PK Set contained data for all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. All efficacy analyses 
were conducted using the Safety Set, which included 11 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug in Part B/Cohort 6. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Sweat chloride: The absolute changes from baseline were calculated at each time point for those 
subjects in Part B/Cohort 6 that had both a baseline value and a value at that time point. One subject had 
a missing baseline sample because of insufficient sweat sample volume. For this subject, historical sweat 
chloride values were used for baseline. Five subjects did not have sweat chloride measurements at Week 
24: for 2 subjects, measurements were not collected, and for 3 subjects, sweat sample volumes were 
insufficient. The mean (SD) sweat chloride level at baseline was 101.5 (9.8) mmol/L (n=11). Treatment 
with IVA led to rapid reductions in sweat chloride concentrations at Week 2 that were sustained to Week 
24. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -52.6 (16.4) mmol/L (n = 9) at 
Week 2 and -58.6 (16.5) mmol/L (n = 6) at Week 24. Mean absolute changes from baseline in sweat 
chloride concentration are summarized below.

Table 8 Absolute Changes from Baseline in Sweat Chloride (mmol/L), FAS, Part B/Cohort 6 
Four (36.4%) subjects had at least 1 on-treatment sweat chloride value ≤30 mmol/L. At Week 24, 3 
subjects had a sweat chloride value <35 mmol/L, including 1 subject who had a sweat chloride value <30 
mmol/L which is the diagnostic cut-off for normal sweat chloride. To evaluate individual subject response 
to IVA, a waterfall plot showing the absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week 24 for 
subjects with baseline and Week 24 results is presented in below. Sweat chloride concentration decreased 
in all of these subjects: changes ranged from 31.0 to 73.5 mmol/L.

B/Cohort 6 
Eleven infants were enrolled in Part B/Cohort 6. Median (range) weight-for-length Z-score and percentile 
at baseline were 0.11 (-0.48, 0.71) and 53.8 (32, 76), respectively for some infants. These values for 
other infants were as follows: 0.17 (-1.48, 1.26) and 56.7 (7, 90). The median (range) change from 
baseline at week 24 in the z-score and percentile was for some infants 1.63 (1.04, 2.22) and 42.2 (20, 
64), respectively. For other infants these values were as follows: 0.02 (-2.04, 1.99) and 0.8 (-69, 42).   
Exocrine pancreatic function and inflammation:  
Faecal elastase-1 (FE-1): Mean FE-1 at Week 24 (291.3 μg/g) was increased compared to baseline (119.6 
μg/g). The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline (n=10) was 53.3 (61.5) μg/g at Week 2 and 159.3 
(154.4) μg/g at Week 24 (n=9). Mean absolute changes from baseline in FE-1 are shown in the below 
table.

Page 38/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 13 Absolute Change From Baseline in Faecal Elastase-1 (μg/g), FAS, Part B/Cohort 6 
Nine subjects had FE-1 values at baseline and at Week 24 and 2 of them were pancreatic sufficient (FE-1 
values > 200 μg/g at baseline) and remained with values above this cut-off throughout the 24 weeks of 
treatment. The mean (SD) FE-1 values at baseline for the 7 subjects with exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency was 28.6 (30.6) μg/g. At week 24, the mean (SD) FE-1 value was 231.6 (141.8) μg/g. The 
mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24 was 203.1 (147.3) μg/g. Five of the 7 subjects with 
FE-1 values ≤200 µg/g at baseline had FE-1 values >200 µg/g at Week 24. Two of these 7 subjects 
remained with values ≤ 200 µg/g at Week 24. For none of the subjects who were exocrine pancreatic 
insufficient a value of FE-1 above the cut-off of 500 μg/g was observed which was seen in the two subjects 
who were pancreatic sufficient at baseline.  
Immuno-reactive  trypsin and/or trypsinogen  (IRT):  The  mean  (SD)  absolute change  from  baseline  to 
Week 24 in IRT was -406.2 (363.3) ng/mL. The absolute change from baseline was only calculated at 
each time point for those subjects who had a baseline value. At week 24 the mean absolute change from 
baseline in IRT could be calculated for 9 children. Mean absolute changes from baseline in IRT are shown 
here:  
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 39/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 14 Absolute Change From Baseline in IRT (ng/mL), FAS, Part B/Cohort 6 
Six subjects in Cohort 6 had both baseline and Week 24 data for IRT. All 6 subjects who had these values 
were pancreatic insufficient at baseline (FE-1 < 200 μg/g). The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline 
at week 24 in IRT using the Cisbio assay (range of detection from 8.0 to 1200 ng/ml) was -450.6 (376.7) 
ng/ml. Median change (Min, Max) was -480.4 (-830.3, 0.0) ng/ml.  
Lipase, total amylase: Serum lipase and amylase levels were collected as part of safety assessments in 
Parts A and B. Only data from Part B/Cohort 6 are reported.  The range of reference of lipase levels is 
method-dependent. The specific assay used in Study 124 was an enzymatic colour rate assay. The normal 
range of this assay considered in Study 124 is 4 to 23 U/L (aged <12 months) and 4 to 31 U/L (aged ≥12 
months). Ten infants enrolled in cohort 6 of Study 124 had lipase levels at both baseline and at week 24. 
The mean (SD) change from baseline at week 24 in lipase levels in subjects with pancreatic insufficiency 
(n=8) was -90.50 (75.04) with a median (range) change of -100.00 (-203.0, 23.0) U/L. For those with 
lipase levels elevated at baseline (n=10, mean [SD] 362.90 [281.18] U/L), the mean (SD) change from 
baseline at week 24 was -265.40 (287.06) with a median (range) of -137.50 (-885.0, 23.0) U/L. The 
mean baseline value in children with elevated values is 362.90 U/L which is almost 16 times higher than 
the upper limit of the normal range (23 U/L). The maximum value at baseline was 983.0 U/L (22 times 
higher than the upper limit of the normal range). These values are of concern but the all subjects with 
elevations in lipase at baseline were asymptomatic.  
Regarding amylase (total amylase), the normal range of serum amylase considered in Study 124 is 6 to 
44 U/L (aged <12 months) and 8 to 79 U/L (aged ≥12 months). The assay used in Study 124 uses as 
substrate  2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-α-D-maltotrioside  (CNPG3)  and  gives  a  direct  measurement  of 
α-amylase activity in the sample.    
EMA/613823/2019

Ten infants enrolled in cohort 6 of Study 124 had total amylase levels at both baseline and at week 24. 
The mean (SD) change from baseline at week 24 in amylase levels in subjects with pancreatic 
insufficiency (n=8) was -7.8 (31.1) U/L with a median (range) change of -6.5 (-58, 52) U/L. For those 
with amylase levels elevated at baseline (n=8, mean [SD] 92.0 [34.4] U/L), the mean (SD) change from 
baseline at week 24 was -28.5 (40.9) U/L with a median (range) of -37.0 (-76, 52) U/L. The mean 
baseline value in children with elevated values is 92.0 U/L which is 2 times higher than the upper limit of 
the normal range (44 U/L). The maximum value at baseline was 145 U/L (3 times higher than the upper 
limit of the normal range).  
Faecal calprotectin (FC):  Nine infants had values of FC at both baseline and week 24. Out of these 9 
infants, 7 had exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). At baseline, the mean (SD) values of FC was 128.80 
(97.73) μg/g with a median (range) value of 81.90 (50.8, 272.6) μg/g. The mean (SD) absolute change 
from baseline at week 24 in FC in subjects with EPI was -44.21 (146.90) µg/g with a median (range) value 
of -50.60 (-256.3, 155.4) µg/g. In infants with pancreatic sufficiency (n=2) a mean absolute decrease of 
-56.70 µg/g was observed.  
Efficacy endpoints related to lung disease: 
•  One subject had LCI assessed. The absolute change from baseline at Week 24 was -0.84. LCI 
values were 7.47 at Day 1 (baseline) and 6.63 at Week 24. 
•  One subject had Infant Pulmonary Function Tests (IPFTs) performed. For this subject, only 
Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) values were available at both baseline and Week 24. The 
absolute change in FRC from baseline at Week 24 was 77.60 mL. FRC was 163.90 mL at baseline 
and 241.50 mL at Week 24. 
• 
There were no identifiable trends in qualitative microbiology oropharyngeal culture outcomes. 
o  Of 11 subjects, 9 had paired samples for evaluation of Burkholderia, H. influenzae, 
methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus 
(MRSA), and P. aeruginosa at baseline and Week 24. 
  One subject had a positive P. aeruginosa non-mucoid culture at baseline; this 
subject had a negative culture at Week 24. 
 
 
Two subjects had positive MSSA cultures at baseline; both had positive cultures 
at Week 24. 
Five subjects had positive H. influenzae cultures at baseline; 2 had negative 
cultures at Week 24, and 3 had positive cultures at Week 24. 
  One subject had a negative H. influenzae culture at baseline and a positive 
culture at Week 24. 
  No cases of MRSA or Burkholderia were observed over the treatment period. 
• 
Two definitions of PEx were used for analyses because there is no consensus definition for PEx in 
younger pediatric patients.  
o  Definition 1: 7 subjects (63.6%) had a total of 10 PEx. The observed event rate per year 
is 1.95.  
o  Definition 2: 3 subjects (27.3%) had a total of 4 PEx.  The observed event rate per year 
is 0.78. 
o  One subject had 1 CF-related hospitalization (event rate/year = 0.20).

•  A palatability assessment of ivacaftor granules was performed at the Day 1 Visit of Part B. All 
subjects fully consumed the dose. The majority of subjects (8 [72.7%]) liked the food with 
ivacaftor granules (either very much or a little). Overall, the mean study drug compliance was 
99.3%, and 100% of subjects were ≥80% compliant with study drug.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The extension of the indication of Kalydeco to children with CF aged 6 to less 12 months who have a 
pre-specified CFTR gating mutation in at least an allele of the CFTR gene is based on a report (Interim 
Analysis 2 Report) that describes PK, safety and efficacy data from children enrolled in Cohort 2 (Part A) 
and Cohort 6 (Part B) of study 124 which is an ongoing (as it continues to enrol children below 6 months 
of age) open-label, two-part study in infants and toddlers less than 2 years. In Part A, which is intended 
to assess PK and safety, subjects received ivacaftor granules based on body weight (25, 50 or 75 mg BID) 
for 4 days. During Part B, ivacaftor doses (adjusted if needed based on results of Part A) are administered 
for 24 weeks which allows detecting short-term safety and efficacy. Cohorts 2 and 6 only enrolled children 
aged 6 to less than 12 months. All subjects who completed 24 weeks of treatment in Part B are eligible to 
enrol in an uncontrolled extension study (Study 126) which will provide 96 weeks of ivacaftor treatment.     
In study 124, ivacaftor granules were administered orally every 12 hours at the following doses after 
mixing with approximately 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of appropriate liquid or soft food and administered with an 
age-appropriate fat-containing meal or snack: • 25 mg for subjects weighing 5 to <7 kg, • 50 mg for 
subjects weighing 7 to <14 kg, • 75 mg for subjects weighing ≥14 to <25 kg. At each study visit in Part 
B, the dose for each subject was adjusted based on body weight if necessary. Based on the data provided 
at week 24 none of the subjects enrolled in Cohort 6/Part B received a dose of 75 mg BID as the maximum 
body weight observed at week 24 was 12.8 kg. 
No formal dose-response studies were conducted, but dose finding was supported by population PK 
analysis aimed at targeting a similar systemic exposure as that of older paediatric and adult subjects that 
has been shown to be efficacious. This is acceptable as well as the general approach of the modelling and 
simulation study which used allometric scaling of clearance and volume of distribution and implemented 
in the model a maturation function driven by post-menstrual age to account for maturational changes in 
clearance. However, the latter was not kept in the initial selected model (as model fit did not improve) and 
only body weight was retained as the covariate that explains variability in ivacaftor PK in a meaningful 
manner. The MAH was requested to update the model with the available PK data of children below 6 
months of age. This was done and one of the models (Model 4) developed included a maturation function 
and was the one producing the best fit of the data in spite of which it was not considered appropriate by 
the MAH. Additional CHMP questions were raised in this respect, and finally it has been agreed that Model 
4 (model with empirical effect of body weight on Cl and a maturation effect that depends on PMA) is the 
one that best fits the data. The simulations provided based on this model indicate that the proposed 
dosing recommendations are reasonable as most infants aged 6 to less than 12 months would present an 
exposure similar to that in adults while less than 5% of them could present an exposure higher than that 
observed in adults.  
Lack of randomisation/placebo control arm of study 124 is justified on the basis of extrapolation of 
efficacy (from adults and older children) as the underlying cause of CF and the mechanism of action of 
ivacaftor are the same regardless of the age of the subjects with cystic fibrosis considered. From this 
perspective pharmacokinetics and safety of ivacaftor were selected as appropriate primary endpoints for 
study 124 with PD and efficacy endpoints being secondary and tertiary endpoints respectively. The main 
uncertainties in relation to extrapolation of efficacy are related to the heterogeneity of target organs and 
the progression of the disease over time which lead to clinical manifestations that vary according to age 
and require efficacy endpoints tailored to the age of the population considered.

The diagnosis of CF is confirmed by laboratory evidence of abnormal CFTR protein function (a positive 
sweat test) or by genotyping analysis. The need for the presence of clinical features compatible with the 
diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (which is the main criterion for the diagnosis) was not a requisite. This seems 
reasonable taking into account that at young ages clinically apparent lung disease may be absent 
although lung structural changes may be already present and progressing. In children with CF, pancreatic 
insufficiency and poor nutritional status are the most significant clinical manifestations of the disease. It 
is anticipated that ivacaftor treatment in this age range may contribute to slowing disease progression at 
older ages and to the prevention of the negative consequences of CF, such as compromised lung and 
pancreatic function, impaired nutritional status, development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or liver 
disease. A robust demonstration in this respect is hampered by the lack of appropriate endpoints and by 
the length of the follow-up that would be required. The PASS study requested at the time of MA of 
Kalydeco (“enrolling” children aged 6 and older patients) in which long-term safety and effectiveness 
measures were assessed showed that in the UK and US registries where this study was conducted, 
ivacaftor-treated patients had a lower prevalence of CF-related complications and select microorganisms 
and had better preserved lung function. There are a number of limitations in relation to the design of the 
PASS study (such as this was primarily a safety study) but the data are overall encouraging. 
In Part A, a single child received 25 mg BID while in Part B all children received 50 mg BID which is 
somehow expected if it is considered that according to the WHO weight-for-age growth charts 5 kg (the 
lower limit of body weight considered) is below the third percentile for both boys and girls at the age of 6 
months. The 2016 annual report of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry shows that the 
median z-score of weight-for-age in the age group from birth to 4 years is -0.2, i.e., close to the median 
of a healthy population of reference (CDC 2000 reference charts used by the registry to compute z-scores 
for weight, height, and BMI). In the 2018 Annual Report of the UK Cystic Fibrosis Patient Registry females 
aged 1 year had a median (IQR) weight percentile of 53.3 (25.2-72.9) while in males of the same age 
these figures were 61.9 (35.4-84.9). There seems to be a systematic lower weight in females compared 
to males that is more evident at older ages. This justifies that results of body weight-for-age z-scores etc. 
are provided separately by sex even acknowledging that in Part B a small number of male subjects were 
enrolled. In Part B (24 weeks of duration), safety, PD (sweat chloride), and efficacy variables (nutritional 
status, markers of exocrine pancreatic function, markers of intestinal inflammation, pulmonary function 
tests and microbiology) were evaluated. Efficacy evaluation was tertiary objective in this study. 
Change in percent predict FEV1 (the recommended primary endpoint to be used for registration studies as 
outlined in the EMA CF guideline, EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008) is not feasible in children from birth 
through 5 years of age because FEV1 involves spirometry, which cannot be performed by young children 
as forced manoeuvres are needed. In addition, spirometry is not sufficiently sensitive to detect early 
manifestations of lung disease in young children with cystic fibrosis and for assessing response to 
treatment. In study 124, assessment of lung clearance index (LCI) is planned but only for subjects whose 
parents/legal tutors specifically consent. Lung clearance index (LCI) is not (yet) a validated endpoint and 
the change (decrease) reflecting a treatment effect that is clinically relevant has not been identified. 
However, its use is encouraged in young children. Similarly, study 124 includes the assessment of Infant 
Pulmonary Function Tests (IPFT) such as plethysmography only for those children whose parents/legal 
representatives specifically consent to the procedure.        
Nutritional status has a significant effect on pulmonary disease progression and survival in patients with 
cystic fibrosis.  As a consequence, the nutritional status of children with CF is closely followed. For infants 
and young children, the aim of nutritional interventions is to achieve the 50th percentile of weight and 
length for a healthy same-age population up to age of two years (Turck D, Braegger CP, Colombo C et al. 
2016). Weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length-for-age z-scores were assessed in study 
124. However, the interpretation of the absolute change from baseline in the anthropometric parameters 
is limited, not only by the lack of a control group but also by the nutritional interventions (including PERT) 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 47/73 
 
  
 
 
 
that are put in place in children diagnosed following newborn screening. Furthermore, interpretation of 
such data in the absence of information about daily intake and appetite of these children is challenging. Of 
note, this information is particularly easy to collect in this age range.   
Markers of exocrine pancreatic function such as faecal elastase-1 (FE-1) and serum immune reactive 
trypsinogen (IRT) seem particularly relevant for these young children as in the presence of 2-CF causing 
mutations belonging to class I, II, or III exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is usually well established 
very soon after birth. These endpoints hold the potential to address whether EPI can be prevented or 
improved (as FE-1 in the range of EPI is present soon after birth). The lack of a control, group is, however, 
a drawback for their interpretation, in particular in case of IRT where very high levels are presented at 
birth that decrease over time. Although different patterns of decrease have been observed, this decrease 
occurs across a number of years. In prior procedures, the MAH argued that decreases of IRT in response 
to ivacaftor were seen more rapid than the usual decrease seen due to the underlying disease. A number 
of additional uncertainties were related to the assay used to determine IRT which is critical as a number 
of factors may affect the values of IRT and their interpretation. In Study 124 the Cisbio assay was used 
which is a radioimmunoassay that is specific for trypsin, trypsinogen, and the enzyme's inhibited forms, 
and has a range of detection from 8.0 to 1200 ng/mL. In healthy adult subjects the serum trypsin 
concentration ranges from 140 to 400 ng/mL (median 200 ng/mL). In children aged 6 to 12 months a 
cut-off value(s) or a range of reference of normal values is not addressed but it is likely that this is 
age-dependent. In newborn screening programs in Europe, a fixed cut-off of 60 to 90 ng/mL (median 65) 
or a floating cut-off ranging from the 99.0th to 99.5th percentiles of all samples tested by a laboratory 
was used to determine the abnormal range. Even though total amylase and lipase are collected for safety 
purposes, they are presented under efficacy assessment as both are thought to be also markers of 
pancreatic inflammation. Limited evidence has been provided showing the course of serum lipase levels in 
young infants with cystic fibrosis. In a study performed by Gleghorm G et al (1985), lipase was 
significantly elevated in infants with CF who were younger than 1 year, irrespective of pancreatic function 
(sufficient or insufficient).  After the first year of life, lipase values declined toward normal. When 
compared to the rate of decline of trypsinogen (also determined in the same study), lipase decline was 
greater, i.e., 67% of lipase values were within or below the normal range by 3 years, whereas 67% of 
trypsinogen values continued to be elevated. As for total amylase, also limited evidence seems to exist.  
The overall conclusion from the MAH is that values below the normal range for amylase and lipase appear 
to correlate with pancreatic insufficiency and normal or above normal values with preservation of 
pancreatic function. While collecting and reporting values of lipase and (preferably) pancreatic isoamylase 
is endorsed, the fact remains that there is very sparse evidence about the course of lipase and amylase 
levels in subjects with cystic fibrosis. 
Faecal calprotectin (FC) is a non-CF specific inflammatory marker which is known to be elevated in 
patients with CF, particularly in pancreatic insufficient (PI) patients (Garg M et al 2017). The study by 
Garg (2013) included a sample of patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy controls in the age range from 
0 to 10 years. FC levels are usually low in infants with cystic fibrosis during the first year of life and 
increase afterwards until the age of four years. As a consequence of distinctive age-related variations in 
the values, careful interpretation of levels of FC is required in children under four years of age. From > 4 
to 10 years, FC was consistently higher in CF patients compared with healthy controls.  In Study 124 the 
assay used to determine FC was a commercial immunoassay for which the normal range of reference 
quoted ranges from 15.625 to 162.9 µg/g with an upper assay range until 2000 µg/g. However, this assay 
has been mainly assessed in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease.  
The sample size of study 124 was based on the availability of the subject population and PK analysis 
considerations, and not on any statistical consideration. Therefore, the study is not powered to detect a 
significant treatment effect.  Continuous variables (analysed as the absolute change from baseline to the 
pos-baseline value) and categorical variables were summarized by standard descriptive statistics. 
EMA/613823/2019

Incomplete/missing data were not imputed. The difficulties to measure certain variables (e.g. sweat 
chloride) in these young children are acknowledged by the CHMP.    
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In Part A, 6 infants were enrolled. Their mean age (SD) was 7.7 (1.86) months. All 6 subjects were White 
and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The majority of subjects had the G551D mutation, and 1 subject 
had the R117H mutation. The most prevalent genotype was G551D/F508del (5 out of the 6 subjects).  
Complete set of anthropometric parameters as z-scores and percentiles were provided by the MAH upon 
request for children enrolled in Part A. For the overall population of infants enrolled in Part A/Cohort 2, 
both the mean and median values of weight-for age z-scores and percentiles show that these children are 
below the median value of weight expected in a healthy same-age population of reference but still above 
the cut-off of -2 which would be indicative of underweight. Weight-for-age, however, fails to distinguish 
between short children of adequate body weight and tall, thin children. The mean and median values of 
length-for-age z-scores and percentiles show normal values (e.g., median mean length-for-age 
percentile of 75.8) which is somehow striking when considering that most children with cystic fibrosis 
usually present with worse values of stature than of body weight. Regarding weight-for-length z-scores 
and percentiles which may be indicative of wasting (i.e., children too light for their height), the median 
values (-1.21 and 11.2 respectively) indicate that these children are below the expected median values of 
a healthy same-age population of reference, with some of them close to -2 (with values below -2 
indicative of wasting). Wasting or thinness indicates in most cases a recent and severe process of weight 
loss, which is often associated with acute starvation and/or severe disease. However, wasting may also be 
the result of a chronic unfavourable condition.    
In part B, 11 infants were enrolled (three of them from Part A) and all of them received ivacaftor 50 mg 
BID given that at Day 1 as all subjects weighted 7 to <14 kg (range: 7.8 to 10.7 kg). The mean (SD) age 
at baseline was 9.0 (1.34) months. All 11 subjects were White. The majority of subjects had a G551D 
mutation. One subject had a G178R mutation. The most prevalent genotype was G551D/F508del.  
The median (min, max) weight- and length-for-age z-scores were 0.71 (-0.76, 1.24) and 0.69 (-0.67, 
1.61) respectively. The median (min, max) weight-for-length-for-age z-score was 0.17 (-1.48, 1.26) 
while the median (min, max) weight-for-length percentile was 56.7 (7, 90) which is in clear contrast with 
the median values observed in Part A (-1.21 and 11.2 respectively). Clarification was requested from the 
MAH in this respect given the difference in anthropometric parameters between children enrolled in Part 
A/Cohort 2 and those in Part B/Cohort 6 with the latter overall having better anthropometric parameters 
at baseline likely reflecting a more preserved nutritional status except for the above mentioned strikingly 
higher length-for-age z-score and percentile in Part A/ Cohort 2 which suggests that children enrolled in 
Part A were tall and thin as compared to children enrolled in Part B. In their response, the MAH stated that 
at baseline subjects enrolled in Part B were slightly older than subjects enrolled in Part A (median age at 
baseline Part A: 7.0 months, Part B: 9.0 months) and had grown in size contributing to the higher median 
weight-for- length percentile at baseline. Even if the numerical differences in weight-for-length 
percentiles between Part A and Part B are acknowledged, these are considered not to be relevant to the 
core purpose of Part A, which was to characterize the PK and establish appropriate dosing for Part B. The 
MAH was requested to further discuss this issue. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of 
the 3 infants who continued in Part B and of those who did not do it were provided and the reason(s) for 
not being enrolled in Part B clarified. Two infants from Part A/Cohort 2 were not enrolled in Part B/Cohort 
6 due to their age at Day 1 of Study 124 while the family of the 3rd child elected to screen for the 
extension study 126. In addition, this subject apparently was about to age out of eligibility for Part B. The 
3 infants who enrolled in Part B were younger.  In terms of weight-for-length percentiles, children who did 
not enrol in Part B had overall lower values than the ones of infants who did (as expected) but no 
systematic differences are observed in these two groups of children.   
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 49/73 
 
  
 
 
 
The MAH concludes that nutritional parameters were normal at baseline. None of the z-scores discussed 
are below -2 which would be indicative of growth problems. However, it appears that even within the 
normality, not all of the children enrolled were in a similar situation at baseline.  
Median (range) baseline sweat chloride was 101.5 (85.5, 111.5) mmol/l (n=11). Regarding FE-1 and IRT, 
mean (SD) baseline values were 119.6 (199.1) μg/g (n=10) and 1120.6 (238.2) ng/ml (n=9) 
respectively.  
Data provided regarding the medical history of the patients enrolled in Part B shows that almost all 
patients (10/11) had CF lung disease and/or pancreatic insufficiency.  
Children in study 124 continued to receive their usual, prescribed CF therapy in addition to ivacaftor. The 
most commonly reported concomitant medications were pancreatin (72.7%), sodium chloride (63.3%), 
amoxicillin (45.5%), and paracetamol (45.5%). Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (pancreatin or 
pancrelipase) was reported for 9 (81.8%) subjects. Ten subjects are reported to have pancreatic failure 
while only 9 seem to be receiving pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. 
Sweat chloride 
The mean (SD) sweat chloride level at baseline was 101.5 (9.8) mmol/L (n=11). Treatment with ivacaftor 
led to rapid reductions in sweat chloride concentrations at Week 2 that were sustained to Week 24. The 
mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -52.6 (16.4) mmol/L at Week 2 and -58.6 
(16.5) mmol/L (n = 6) at Week 24. Four (36.4%) subjects had at least 1 on-treatment sweat chloride 
value ≤30 mmol/L. At Week 24, 3 subjects had a sweat chloride value <35 mmol/L, including 1 subject 
who had a sweat chloride value <30 mmol/L which is the diagnostic cut-off for normal sweat chloride.  
The mean change in sweat chloride is within the range of the decrease seen in older children and adult 
patients.  
Weight, Weight-for-age z-score, and Weight-for-age Percentile 
Five infants enrolled in Part B had a weight-for-age Z-score between 0 and -1 SDS at baseline which is 
shown by a minimum value of -0.76. At week 24 some children were still below 0 SDS as shown by a 
minimum value of -0.52 but the mean weight-for-age Z-score increased from 0.37 at baseline to 0.73 at 
Week 24 (mean [SD] absolute change from baseline 0.36 [0.54]).  
Only a small number of male infants were enrolled in Cohort 6. The median (range) absolute change in 
weight-for-age z-score and percentile from baseline at week 24 was 1.05 (0.48, 1.63) and 28.2 (6, 50) 
respectively. These figures for some infants were as follows: 0.26 (-0.29, 0.70) and 10.3 (-8, 18) 
respectively. The MAH was requested to clarify an apparently anomalous result seen in one of the subjects 
in the other group for which the mean weight-for-age percentile changed at week 24 with a mean change 
in body weight. In this case, the median weight-for-length percentile at week 24, i.e. indicative of possible 
risk of overweight. These values were confirmed and therefore this is expected to have an impact on the 
calculation of the mean values that are included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Mean (SD) weight at baseline was 8.9 (1.0) kg. The mean absolute change (SD) from baseline at Week 24 
was 1.8 (0.7) kg. At Week 24, mean (SD) weight was 10.7 (1.1) kg which according to the WHO growth 
charts of weight-for-age percentiles would correspond to a value above the 85th percentile for the age 
range from 6 months to less than 12 months.  
Length, Length-for-age z-score, and Length-for-age Percentile 
Regarding mean absolute changes from baseline in length-for-age Z-scores, 4 children enrolled in Part B 
had a length Z-score between 0 and -1 SDS which is shown by a minimum value of -0.67.  At week 24 
some children were still below 0 SDS as shown by a minimum value of -1.81 but the mean length-for-age 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 50/73 
 
  
 
 
 
Z-score increased from 0.63 at baseline to 0.89 at Week 24 (mean [SD] absolute change from baseline 
0.27 [1.34]).  
The above data have been also provided as percentiles and by sex. As said, only a small number of male 
patients were enrolled in Cohort 6. The median (range) change from baseline at week 24 in the z-score 
and percentile was for some infants -0.48 (-0.69, -0.27) and -11.2 (-12, -10) respectively. For other 
infants these values were as follows: 0.41 (-1.81, 3.38) and 10.8 (-58, 41).  
Mean (SD) length at baseline was 72.5 (2.6) cm. The mean absolute change (SD) from baseline at Week 
24 was 7.7 (3.5) cm. At Week 24, mean (SD) length was 80.2 (4.4) cm which according to the WHO 
growth charts of length-for-age percentiles would correspond to a value around the 97th percentile for the 
age range from 6 months to less than 12 months. This is quite an anomalous value even considering that 
it is a mean value. It has been clarified that the length of one subject was very likely overestimated at 
week 24 as the change from baseline at week 24 was 10.7 cm.  
Weight-for-length-for-age z-score and Weight-for-length-for-age Percentile 
Regarding mean absolute changes from baseline in weight-for-length-for-age Z-score, 5 children enrolled 
in Part B had a weight-for-length-for-age Z-score between 0 and -2 SDS at baseline which is shown by a 
minimum value of -1.48.  At week 24 some children were below -2 SDS as shown by a minimum value of 
-2.04 but the mean weight-for-length-for-age Z-score increased from 0.13 at baseline to 0.40 at Week 24 
(mean [SD] absolute change from baseline 0.26 [1.3]). Based on the maximum value of 2.16 observed at 
week 24 it would appear that some children are overweight (i.e., weight-for-length-for-age Z-score > 2 
SDS). Weight-for-length-for-age Z-scores and percentiles have been provided also by sex. The median 
(range) change from baseline at week 24 in the z-score and percentile was for the male infants 1.63 
(1.04, 2.22) and 42.2 (20, 64), respectively. For female infants these values were as follows: 0.02 (-2.04, 
1.99) and 0.8 (-69, 42). The interpretation of the anthropometric data is not that easy in the absence of 
additional information such as assessment of daily intake, appetite etc. The maximum 
weight-for-length-for-age z-score at week 24 shows that some children are overweight (i.e., Z-score 
above + 2 SDS) while others remain below the target of the 50th percentile (that would correspond to a 
0 Z-score in a population normally distributed). The MAH was requested to clarify the distribution of the 
eleven children enrolled in Part B according to their weight-for-length-for-age Z-scores and percentiles at 
baseline and at week 24.  The MAH states that the data are well distributed across the possible range of 
percentiles at baseline and at Week 24. Overall, the baseline dataset includes infants with 
weight-for-length z-scores which range from values close to -2 to +1.26 which are still considered within 
the normal range. However, the lowest value at baseline is closed to the cut-off indicative of wasting 
(below -2) while the highest one at week 24 is indicative of overweight (i.e., 2.16). The influence of these 
extreme values is noted when calculating mean and median values. Mean (SD) values are included in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC for both cohort 5 (12 to less than 24 months) and cohort 6 (6 to less than 12 
months) which should be viewed with some caution for the reasons mentioned. For completeness median 
(main, max) values will also be included. As Study 124 is ongoing further refinement of the data described 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC will be done as applicable at the time the final results of the study are 
submitted.  
Although CF is commonly associated with undernutrition, the proportion of overweight and obese 
individuals is increasing. Increased weight does not necessarily correlate with better lung function as high 
fat mass but low lean body (muscle) mass predicts in fact poor CF disease prognosis. Therefore, body 
composition needs to be assessed in all overweight/obese patients as well as in those underweight. 
Serum/plasmatic markers such as blood count, iron status (transferrin), serum prealbumin etc. are also 
used to assess the nutritional status.

Out of the 9 subjects with FE-1 data at baseline and at week 24, 7 subjects were pancreatic insufficient. 
The mean (SD) FE-1 values at baseline for these 7 subjects was 28.6 (30.6) μg/g. At week 24, the mean 
(SD) FE-1 value was 231.6 (141.8) μg/g. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24 was 
203.1 (147.3) μg/g.  Five of them had FE-1 values >200 µg/g at Week 24 while the other two had an FE-1 
value ≤200 µg/g. None of these subjects had a post-baseline FE-1 value FE-1 ≥500 μg/g. Two subjects 
who were pancreatic sufficient at baseline reached a value above 500 μg/g and none of them became 
insufficient during treatment with ivacaftor. 
Immunoreactive trypsin and/or trypsinogen (IRT) 
Six subjects in cohort 6 had both baseline and Week 24 data for IRT and a baseline FE-1 value. All 6 
subjects who had these values were pancreatic insufficient at baseline (FE-1 < 200 μg/g). The mean (SD) 
absolute change from baseline at week 24 in IRT using the Cisbio assay (range of detection from 8.0 to 
1200 ng/ml) was -450.6 (376.7) ng/ml. Median change (Min. Max) was -480.4 (-830.3, 0.0) ng/ml.  
IRT is elevated immediately after birth in neonates with CF as a marker for pancreatic ductal congestion 
and reflects leakage from the exocrine cells to the blood. This is accompanied by fibrosis and ongoing loss 
of exocrine tissue. IRT levels are therefore expected to decline with age naturally and this may confound 
the effect of ivacaftor. However, the rapid (observed at week 2) and steep decline after starting ivacaftor 
suggests a treatment effect and, supports the hypothesis that early intervention with ivacaftor can 
improve pancreatic function in young children mainly if this accompanied for consistent trends in other 
biomarkers of gastrointestinal function and inflammation. 
Lipase, total amylase 
Ten infants enrolled in cohort 6 of Study 124 had lipase levels at both baseline and at week 24. The mean 
(SD) change from baseline at week 24 in lipase levels in subjects with pancreatic insufficiency (n=8) was 
-90.50 (75.04) with a median (range) change of -100.00 (-203.0, 23.0) U/L. For those with lipase levels 
elevated at baseline (n=10, mean [SD] 362.90 [281.18] U/L), the mean (SD) change from baseline at 
week 24 was -265.40 (287.06) with a median (range) of -137.50 (-885.0, 23.0) U/L. The mean baseline 
value in children with elevated values is 362.90 U/L which is almost 16 times higher than the upper limit 
of the normal range (23 U/L). The maximum value at baseline was 983.0 U/L (22 times higher than the 
upper limit of the normal range). These values are of concern but all subjects with elevations in lipase at 
baseline were asymptomatic. While the mean values show reasonable decreases, there is a maximum 
value of decrease of -885.0 U/L which is assumed to be the one observed in the subject with a baseline 
value of 983.0 U/L. 
Ten infants enrolled in cohort 6 of Study 124 had total amylase levels at both baseline and at week 24. 
The mean (SD) change from baseline at week 24 in amylase levels in subjects with pancreatic 
insufficiency (n=8) was -7.8 (31.1) U/L with a median (range) change of -6.5 (-58, 52) U/L. For those 
with amylase levels elevated at baseline (n=8, mean [SD] 92.0 [34.4] U/L), the mean (SD) change from 
baseline at week 24 was -28.5 (40.9) U/L with a median (range) of -37.0 (-76, 52) U/L. The mean 
baseline value in children with elevated values is 92.0 U/L which is 2 times higher than normal (44 U/L). 
The maximum value at baseline was 145 U/L (3 times higher than normal). 
Reductions in both (mean) serum lipase and total amylase levels were observed over the 24 weeks of 
treatment with ivacaftor. As in the case of IRT, the rapid (observed at week 2) and substantial decline in 
the levels of these enzymes may suggest that treatment with ivacaftor reduces pancreatic inflammation 
in these young subjects. While the use of the pancreatic isoamylase is preferred, it would appear that 
overall these results are in line with those of FE-1 and IRT. However, there are sparse data about the 
values of lipase and amylase that could be expected in subjects with cystic fibrosis as compared to normal 
subjects. Therefore, these data are not included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.     
Faecal calprotectin (FC) 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 52/73 
 
  
 
 
 
At baseline most subjects (9 of 11) were within the normal range provided by the reference lab which 
ranged from 15.625 to 162.9 μg/g while the cut-off value described and used in the study by Garg et al 
(2017) and Ellemuler et al (2018) was 50 µg/g. Nine infants had values of FC at both baseline and week 
24. Out of these 9 infants, 7 had exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). At baseline, their mean (SD) 
value of FC was 128.80 (97.73) μg/g with a median (range) value of 81.90 (50.8, 272.6) μg/g. These 
values for the two subjects with pancreatic sufficiency were 95.40 (12.59) μg/g and 95.40 (86.5, 104.3) 
μg/g. There seems to be some contradictory findings regarding whether the values of FC differ from 
patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency versus those seen in subjects with exocrine pancreatic 
sufficiency. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24 in FC in subjects with EPI was 
-44.21 (146.90) µg/g with a median (range) value of -50.60 (-256.3, 155.4) µg/g. In infants with 
pancreatic sufficiency (n=2) a mean absolute decrease of -56.70 µg/g was observed. While it may be 
difficult in the absence of a control arm to conclude whether the decrease observed in FC can be directly 
attributed to ivacaftor, results in FC when taken together with those observed for other biomarkers of 
gastrointestinal function such as faecal elastase-1 and IRT give support to the potential of ivacaftor as a 
drug that decreases gastrointestinal inflammation. However, as previously said, due to distinctive 
age-related variations, careful interpretation of the levels of FC is required in children under four years of 
age. In addition, there seems to be some contradictory findings regarding whether the values of FC differ 
from patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency versus those seen in subjects with exocrine 
pancreatic sufficiency. 
The pattern seen in FE-1, IRT, lipase, and FC suggests that indeed ivacaftor is able to improve pancreatic 
exocrine function. It is of limit that the assay used to determine IRT in children aged 2 to less than 6 years 
of age (study 108) is not the same as the one used in study 124 as the values cannot be directly 
compared. These variables are usually analysed as a change from baseline to the end of the study. 
Intuitively these are better (or in addition) presented as the percent of subjects who show at baseline an 
altered value and reach at week 24 values within the normal range. Responder’s analyses have not been 
provided by the MAH on the basis that the small sample size of Cohort 6 would not allow for a precise 
analysis. This is accepted for the current procedure. However, it can be anticipated that this question may 
be raised at the time of final results from Study 124 are submitted.         
Pulmonary function (LCI and IPFTs) 
Lung Clearance index and IPFT were performed in a subject each. Regarding LCI, the absolute change 
from baseline at Week 24 was -0.84. LCI values were 7.47 at Day 1 (baseline) and 6.63 at Week 24. As 
for IPTF, only FRC values were available at both baseline and Week 24. The absolute change in FRC from 
baseline at Week 24 was 77.60 mL. FRC was 163.90 mL at baseline and 241.50 mL at Week 24. Whether 
this is consequence of the treatment with ivacafor cannot be properly assessed.  Percent predicted values 
should be used as children are expected to increase lung volumes with growth. The result in LCI is as 
expected although of limited magnitude which may be partially explained for the young age of this cohort 
of children.   
Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx)/Microbiology 
Two definitions of PEx were used for analyses because there is no consensus definition for PEx in younger 
paediatric patients. Under definition 1 (less restrictive), 7 subjects (63.6%) had a total of 10 PEx. The 
observed event rate per year is 1.95. Under definition 2, 3 subjects (27.3%) had a total of 4 PEx (event 
rate per year is 0.78). A single subjects had 1 CF-related hospitalization (event rate/year = 0.20). No 
definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect on pulmonary exacerbations (which occurred at 
an event rate per year which was similar to that seen in infants aged 12 to less than 24 months) or 
microbiology (qualitative microbiology oropharyngeal culture). No cases of MRSA or Burkholderia were 
observed over the treatment period. 
Acceptability and palatability assessment  
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 53/73 
 
  
 
 
 
A palatability assessment of ivacaftor granules was performed at the Day 1 Visit of Part B. All subjects 
fully consumed the dose. The majority of subjects (8 [72.7%]) liked the food with ivacaftor granules 
(either very much or a little). A single time point of assessment seems insufficient and very likely this 
endpoint should have been assessed at additional visits but there is a lack of structured guidance to 
formally assess acceptability and palatability. Overall, the mean study drug compliance was 99.3%, and 
100% of subjects were ≥80% compliant with study drug.  
The present interim analysis of data from study 124 focuses on children aged 6 to less than 12 months of 
age. The MAH was requested to compare the results in this age group to those of children in the age group 
from 12 to less than 24 months and from 2 to less than 6 years of age. As further analyses (by sex and 
by exocrine pancreatic function) have been requested for Cohort 6 in study 124, and only partially for 
Cohort 5 (12 to less than 24 months of age), the same was requested for children under 6 years old, i.e., 
anthropometric parameters (Z-scores and percentiles) by sex and markers of pancreatic inflammation 
(FE-1 and IRT) restricted to subjects with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Overall, the same trend as for 
younger children in Study 124 is observed at baseline (i.e., female girls had overall less preserved 
nutritional status than male children based on weight-for-age z-scores and percentiles). The mean (SD) 
absolute change in weight-for-age z-scores and percentiles were 0.27 (0.16) and 7.6 (5.3) respectively in 
female patients (n=6). In male patients (n=27), these figures were as follows: -0.12 (0.83) and 6.0 (7.6) 
respectively. Regarding, height-for-age z-scores and percentiles, the mean (SD) absolute change from 
baseline at week 24 in female children was -0.27 (0.36) and -8.5 (11.6) respectively. In male children the 
following mean (SD) changes were obtained:  0.05 (0.30) and 2.5 (7.7) respectively. Overall these 
changes are of limited magnitude for both female and male children, in particular when height is 
considered.    
Regarding faecal elastase-1, in study 108 26 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) had 
both baseline and week 24 values. The mean (SD) value of FE-1 was 9.8 (9.3) µg/g. The mean (SD) 
absolute change from baseline was 103.7 (139.6) µg/g with a median (range) value of 103.7 (0, 451) 
µg/g. Therefore, also an increase of FE-1 was seen for some patients but not for all of them. The mean 
(SD) baseline value of FE-1 in subjects with EPI enrolled in Cohort 6 of Study 124 was 25.9 (29.3) µg/g 
with median (range) value of 7.5 (8, 85) µg/g. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24 
was 203.1 (147.3) µg/g with a median (range) value of 236.0 (0, 424) µg/g. Overall, infants in Study 124 
seem to experience changes of higher magnitude than older children which may perhaps be ascribed to 
the cumulative pancreatic damage caused by CF. As for IRT, in children enrolled in Study 108 with EPI and 
for whom values of IRT were available at both baseline and week 24 (n=20), the mean (SD) absolute 
change from baseline at Week 24 was -17.8 (24.3) ng/ml. The magnitude of the change cannot be 
compared to that seen in Cohort 5 (12 months to less than 24 months) and Cohort 6 (6 to less than 12 
months) of Study 124 due to differences of the assay used in both studies. 
A final CSR will be provided for Study 124 when completed, which will include a global analysis of safety 
and efficacy data from all age cohorts. The PI will adequately be updated if needed. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The second interim analysis of Study 124 provides PK, safety, PD (sweat chloride) and some efficacy data 
(tertiary endpoints) of the treatment with ivacaftor in infants aged 6 to less than 12 months with at least 
a pre-specified gating mutation in an allele of the CFTR gene. Study 124 is an uncontrolled study and this 
raises uncertainty about the interpretation of the efficacy endpoints, as for some of them many 
confounders may a play a role. The most robust result is that seen on sweat chloride (mean absolute 
change from baseline of -58.6 mmol/L) which is in the range of values seen in the pivotal trials of ivacaftor 
in older patients. This provides support for extrapolation of efficacy even though this is just a biomarker 
of CFTR activity. Similarly, the increase in FE-1 observed at Week 24 in children with well-established 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 54/73 
 
  
 
 
 
exocrine pancreatic insufficiency seems very relevant but how this translates into quality of life and 
nutritional status would require a prolonged follow-up which cannot be addressed in the frame of a 
relatively short-term registration clinical trial such as Study 124. Additional data have been provided for 
some biomarkers of gastrointestinal function and inflammation that point out in the same direction as 
faecal elastase-1. Whilst the submitted data is considered sufficient to conclude on efficacy in the claimed 
population, further data are needed to interpret the results of biomarkers such as faecal calprotectin, 
lipase and amylase. This is the reason not to reflect them in section 5.1 of the SmPC at this time. As Study 
124 is ongoing further refinement of the data described in section 5.1 of the SmPC will be done as 
applicable at the time when data from all cohorts are available. It would have been very helpful to put the 
data of the present study into context with data coming from disease-registries, an issue that has been 
repeatedly requested but never accomplished. For subjects aged 2 to less than 6 years of age, a PAES, 
which was agreed in a previous procedure, is ongoing aimed at assessing whether starting treatment at 
the age of two years may have an impact on disease progression. The same request was done for children 
below 2 years of age. However, the MAH argued that the number of available children in this age range 
would make the study unfeasible. This was accepted by CHMP. Overall, although some clarity would still 
be desirable about certain aspects as above mentioned, it is considered that from a clinical point, 
sufficient data and argumentation has been provided. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In Part A/Cohort 2, 1 subject received 25 mg IVA, and 5 subjects received 50 mg IVA. All subjects 
completed the 5-day treatment period (4 days of IVA treatment). In Part B/Cohort 6, all 11 subjects 
received 50 mg IVA, and all 11 completed the study. The mean (SD) exposure to study drug was 24.3 
(0.55) weeks (range: 23 to 25 weeks). All 11 subjects enrolled into Study 126 and therefore did not have 
the Follow-up Visit, per protocol. 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics of Study Population 
Part A/Cohort 2: One subject weighed 6.7 kg at baseline and therefore received IVA 25-mg q12h. Five 
subjects weighed 7 to <14 kg (mean: 7.9 kg, range: 7.1 to 8.8 kg) at baseline and therefore received IVA 
50-mg q12h. In the 50-mg group, the mean age was 8 months (range: 6 to 10 months). The mean age 
of all 6 subjects was 7.7 months (range: 6 to 10 months). All subjects were White and of non-Hispanic or 
Latino ethnicity. Nutritional parameters (weight, length, and weight-for-length percentiles) were normal 
at baseline. 
Part B/Cohort 6: All 11 subjects weighed >7 to <14 kg at Day 1 and throughout the treatment period 
(mean weight at baseline: 8.9 kg, range: 7.8 to 10.7 kg) and therefore received IVA 50 mg q12h 
throughout the treatment period. The mean age at baseline was 9 months (range: 7 to 11 months). All 
subjects were White and all, but 1, were of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; ethnicity was not reported for 
the 1 subject. Nutritional parameters (weight, length, weight-for-age z-score, length-for-age z-score, 
weight-for-length-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-length percentiles) were normal at baseline. 
Adverse events 
Part A/Cohort 2. Key safety findings were as follows: 
• 
Four (66.7%) of the 6 subjects had AEs: the subject in the 25 mg group and 3 subjects (60.0%) 
in the 50 mg group. No AEs occurred in more than 1 subject. 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 55/73 
 
  
 
 
 
•  All AEs were mild in severity except for 1 event of vomiting, assessed as moderate in severity. All 
AEs were considered unlikely related or not related to study drug except for 1 event each of 
constipation, vomiting, and sleep disorder, which were considered possibly related to study drug. 
•  There were no deaths, serious AEs (SAEs), treatment interruptions or discontinuations. 
•  There were no notable adverse trends in clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, or ECG 
parameters. 
Part B/Cohort 6. The safety data in this study are consistent with previous studies in subjects 12 months 
of age and older. Key safety findings were as follows: 
•  Ten (90.9%) of the 11 subjects had AEs. 
•  Most AEs were typical for patients with CF of this age group. The most commonly reported AEs 
(>20% of subjects) included cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, pyrexia, and vomiting. 
•  The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity, and considered unlikely 
related or not related to study drug. There were 2 severe AEs (1 AE each of viral rash and 
respiratory tract infection viral) that were also SAEs. There were no life-threatening AEs. 
•  Three (27.3%) subjects had a total of 3 SAEs. The 3 SAEs were viral rash, cough, and respiratory 
tract infection viral. All were considered unlikely or unrelated to study drug. 
•  One (9.1%) subject had an AE of rash that led to treatment interruption. 
•  There were no deaths or treatment discontinuations due to AEs. 
•  One (9.1%) subject had alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation >3 × to ≤5 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN) at Week 24 which was not associated with bilirubin elevation. The subject remained on 
study drug in the extension study 126 and the transaminase elevation resolved. 
•  No subjects had total bilirubin levels above the normal range. 
•  No treatment-emergent cataracts (lens opacities) were observed. 
•  There were no notable adverse trends in other clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, or ECG 
parameters 
Table below summarizes the above information. 
Table 17 Overview of Adverse Events, Safety Set, Part B/Cohort 6 
EMA/613823/2019

The incidence of AEs that occurred in 2 or more subjects is shown in table below. The most common AEs 
were cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, pyrexia, and vomiting. These AEs are generally typical for 
patients with CF in this age group. 
Table 18 Adverse Events Occurring in At Least 2 Subjects by System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term, Safety Set, Part B/Cohort 6 
The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity. There were no AEs that were 
considered life-threatening. Two subjects (18.2%) had AEs that were considered severe (respiratory tract 
infection viral and viral rash). These 2 AEs were also SAEs and narratives have been provided. Of the 10 
subjects who had AEs, 2 subjects had an AE considered related to study drug (both were considered 
possibly related) by the investigator (vomiting, ALT increased). One (9.1%) subject had an AE of rash 
that led to treatment interruption. There were no AEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths or AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. Three (27.3%) subjects had a total of 
3 SAEs. One subject had an SAE of viral rash (suspected eczema coxsackium); 1 subject had an SAE of 
cough; and 1 subject had an SAE of viral respiratory tract infection. All of the SAEs (viral rash, cough, and 
respiratory tract infection viral) were considered by the investigator to be unlikely related or not related 
to study drug. This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Laboratory findings 
Liver Function Test Results: Fluctuations from baseline in mean LFT measurements throughout the 
24-week treatment period were not considered clinically significant. The maximum on-treatment LFT 
results are presented in the table below. The majority of subjects had maximum on-treatment ALT or 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 57/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤2 × ULN. One subject had an ALT elevation >3 × to ≤5 × ULN at Week 
24. The subject enrolled in Study 126 and remained on study drug without interruption. The ALT elevation 
was resolved by the Week 2 Visit of Study 126. No subjects had AST and/or ALT elevations >5 x ULN. No 
subjects had total bilirubin levels above the ULN. 
Table 19 Maximum On-treatment Liver Function Test Results, Safety Set, Part B/Cohort 6 
Lipase and Amylase: Mean (SD) serum lipase at baseline was elevated at 331.36 (286.52) U/L (normal 
range: 4 to 23 U/L [ages <12 months] and 4 to 31 U/L [ages ≥12 months]). The mean (SD) lipase level 
decreased to 90.45 (63.76) U/L at Week 24. Mean (SD) serum amylase at baseline was 76.1 (39.8) U/L 
(normal range: 6 to 44 U/L [ages <12 months] and 8 to 79 U/L [ages ≥12 months]). The mean (SD) 
amylase level decreased to 54.2 (29.0) U/L at Week 24. All subjects with elevations in serum lipase 
and/or amylase at baseline were asymptomatic.  
Electrocardiograms: No clinically important trends were identified in ECG results. All subjects had a 
maximum QTcF interval of ≤450 msec during study treatment. No subjects had an increase in QTcF of 
>30 to ≤60 msec. There were no ECG results that were considered by the investigator to be AEs. 
Safety in special populations 
The proposed dose of IVA granules for patients 6 to <12 months is 25 mg for patients weighing 5 to <7 
kg and 50 mg for patients weighing 7 to <14 kg, administered q12h with fat-containing food. 
Based on the results of Phase 1 Study 013 in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the 
following IVA dose adjustments have been recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment: 
•  ≥6 years: one 150 mg tablet qd 
•  12 months to <6 years and ≥14 kg: one 75-mg sachet/packet of granules qd 
•  12 months to <6 years and 7 to <14 kg: one 50-mg sachet/packet of granules qd 
Although moderate hepatic impairment is relatively rare in children <24 months with CF, such a level of 
liver disease may occur. The recommended dose for patients 6 to <12 months with moderate hepatic 
impairment is similar to the recommendation (but adjusted for the smaller size of these patients) for 
patients 1 to <6 years old with moderate hepatic impairment: 
•  6 to <12 months and ≥5 to <7 kg: one 25-mg sachet/packet of granules qd 
•  6 to <12 months and ≥7 to <14 kg: one 50-mg sachet/packet of granules qd 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 58/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but 
exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The use of IVA in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment is therefore not recommended unless the benefits outweigh the 
risks. In such case, the starting dose should be 1 sachet/packet of granules qd or less frequently. Dosing 
intervals should be modified according to the clinical response and tolerability. In addition, no safety data 
are available in infants aged 6 to less than 12 months of age with moderate hepatic impairment treated 
with ivacaftor. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
A reduction in the IVA dose is recommended for coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A 
inhibitors. The recommended IVA dose in patients ≥6 years of age is 150 mg twice weekly with strong 
CYP3A inhibitors and 150 mg daily (qd) with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. The recommended IVA dose for 
patients 1 to <6 years of age is 50 mg (7 to <14 kg) or 75 mg (≥14 kg) twice weekly during concomitant 
dosing with strong CYP3A inhibitors and 50 mg (<7 to 14 kg) or 75 mg (≥14 kg) qd during concomitant 
dosing with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 
It is expected that during the course of their treatment with IVA, patients 6 to <12 months may receive 
therapeutic agents that include strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Dose adjustments for IVA in 
patients 6 to <12 months in the setting of CYP3A inhibition were extrapolated from that of older patients. 
The population PK analyses support that changes in IVA disposition can be accounted for by changes in 
body weight and that the impact of CYP maturation on IVA disposition in this age group are minimal. The 
recommended IVA dose for patients 6 to <12 months is 25 mg (5 to <7 kg) and 50 mg (7 to <14 kg) twice 
weekly during concomitant dosing with strong CYP3A inhibitors and 25 mg (5 to <7 kg) and 50 mg (7 to 
<14 kg) qd during concomitant dosing with moderate CYP3A inhibitors.  
There were no unique findings due to age to suggest a safety concern related to drug-drug interactions 
(DDI) or other interactions in subjects 6 to <12 months of age. There were no AEs identified caused by 
DDI in Study 124. The DDI profile in children 6 to <12 months of age is expected to be the same as that 
in older subjects based on: 
• 
the population PK analyses which support that changes in IVA disposition can be accounted for by 
changes in body weight and that the impact of CYP maturation on IVA disposition in this age group 
are minimal, and 
• 
IVA exposures in subjects 6 to <12 months of age were comparable to exposures in adults. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Part A/Cohort 2: There were no deaths, SAEs, treatment interruptions, or discontinuations. 
Part B/Cohort 6: There were no deaths or treatment discontinuations due to AEs. One (9.1%) subject had 
an AE of rash that led to treatment interruption.  
Post marketing experience 
IVA is approved in Australia, Brazil, Canada, EU, Israel, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the US. 
Cumulatively, 6,993 patients (representing 12,416 person-years) have received at least 1 dose of IVA 
during the period from the Development International Birth Date of IVA (31 January 2012) to 23 January 
2018. No new safety concerns have been identified based on ongoing postmarketing surveillance data; 
data have been consistent with those from the clinical studies and the established safety profile of IVA. 
Although Kalydeco was approved (29 April 2019) in the USA for patients with CF 6 to <12 months of age 
no post-marketing data for this age group are available yet.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database in the target paediatric population is limited in terms of size and drug exposure. Only 
safety data from 17 children between 6 and 12 months of age from study 124 are available and only 11 
out of them received 50 mg q12h for approximately 24 weeks. This precludes the CHMP from fully 
characterising the safety profile from a quantitative point of view as only frequent adverse reactions could 
be detected. However, based on the available data coming from the interim analysis 2 of study 124, 
ivacaftor seems well tolerated with reported AEs that are consistent with those observed in older children. 
The most common AEs were cough, pyrexia, vomiting and upper respiratory tract infection and most of 
them were mild or moderate in severity. There were no deaths or treatment discontinuations due to AEs. 
There were no safety concerns in clinical laboratory or ECG parameters. A patient from cohort 6 had ALT 
elevation >3 x to ≤5 x ULN but continued on treatment and the levels normalised at week 2 of study 126. 
No patients presented increases of AST/ALT higher than 5 x to ≤ 8 x ULN or 8 x ULN. None had elevations 
of bilirubin >2 x ULN. Overall, these data are reassuring. Furthermore, CYP3A4 maturation may occur at 
a different pace in subjects of the same age. In addition to that, there are a number of CYP3A4 variants 
for which the rates of non-expressers in the general population are relatively high. There are no safety 
data in these situations as prior (within 2 weeks of Day 1 of study 124) or concomitant treatment with 
moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors was not allowed in study 124 as it was the case for children with 
moderate alterations in liver function tests (>2 × ULN) which is striking as non-specific biochemical 
abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT, AST, and GGT) are very common during the first years of life in 
children with CF. The MAH states that the DDI profile in children 6 to <12 months of age is expected to be 
the same as that in older subjects based on pop-PK modelling results and that there were no unique 
findings due to age to suggest a safety concern related to DDI or other interactions in Study 124 subjects. 
As for children with hepatic impairment, safety monitoring is thought to be an appropriate measure to 
mitigate this risk. Dosing recommendations in these special situations are driven by the fact that the 
initially selected pop-PK models did not identify maturation (age) as a relevant covariate to be taken into 
account. Upon request this issue was further explored and it has been concluded that both body weight 
and age are relevant covariates to be taken into account when dosing infants in the age range from 6 to 
less than 12 months. However, the effect of body weight seems more relevant in this age range than that 
of the age. Therefore, the MAH was requested to include a cautionary statement in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC to highlight that there are no safety data in children aged 6 to less than 12 months of age with 
moderate hepatic impairment when treated with ivacaftor at the proposed doses. This was also the case 
for the concomitant administration with moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
The extension study 126 is expected to provide safety data for an additional period of 96 weeks. No safety 
data from this study have been presented in the current submission but it was clarified that children from 
Cohort 6 enrolled in the extension study had not experienced any serious adverse events at data cut-off 
date 13 August 2018. The final CSR of study 126 will be completed in 2022. At the cut-off data 09 April 
2019, 28 subjects out of 36 in this study rolled over from study 124. Most of them, were 12 to < 24 
months of age (n=20) and 4 were ≥ 24 months.  The MAH stated that no new safety concerns had been 
identified at that time and this is reassuring. 
Immunological events had not been specifically addressed by the MAH in the initial submission.  The MAH 
has updated the information with the available data and has clarified that, in all, four cases of rash were 
reported, two from cohort 5 and two from cohort 6. There was no need to change the dose in three of the 
cases and in only one case the treatment was interrupted and resumed.  No other immunological events 
have been identified by the MAH.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The small sample size, the lack of placebo control and the relative short duration of study 124 make it

difficult to perform a comprehensive safety evaluation of ivacaftor in children with CF aged 6 to less than 
12 months. However, the available data suggest that the safety profile in the target paediatric population 
is similar to that seen in older children. The safety data beyond 24 weeks are expected to be supported 
with the data coming from the extension study 126 in which no new adverse reactions have been 
identified until the cut-off data of 09 April 2019. Maturation of CYP3A4 was not shown in the initially 
selected pop-PK models to have an influence on ivacaftor clearance. Upon request of the CHMP, this issue 
was further explored and it has been concluded that both body weight and age are relevant covariates to 
be taken into account when dosing infants in the age range from 6 to less than 12 months. However, the 
effect of body weight seems more relevant in this age range than that of the age and therefore the dosing 
recommendations as proposed by the MAH are acceptable.  
Dosing recommendations for children with moderate hepatic impairment and for the concomitant use 
with CYP4A4 inhibitors initially raised some concern, particularly in the case of concomitant 
administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors as ivacaftor AUC may be increased by 8.5-fold and M1 to a 
lesser extent.  In this respect, the MAH was requested to include a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
highlight that there are no safety data in children aged 6 months to less than 12 months of age with 
moderate hepatic impairment. This was also the case for the concomitant administration with moderate 
or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. The MAH also clarified that the final CSR of study 126 will be completed in 
2022. At the cut-off data 09 April 2019, 28 subjects out of 63 (including de novo patients) rolled over from 
study 124 to study 126. Most of them, were 12 to < 24 months of age (n=20) and 4 were ≥ 24 months. 
The MAH confirmed that no new safety concerns had been identified by then which is reassuring.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Kalydeco granules are currently authorised for children with cystic fibrosis aged 12 months and older and 
weighing ≥ 7 kg to less than 25 kg. The aim of the present procedure is the extension of the indication of 
Kalydeco granules to children with cystic fibrosis aged at least 6 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg, 
as follows:  “ Kalydeco granules are indicated for the treatment of infants aged at least 6 months, toddlers 
and children weighing 5 kg to less than 25 kg with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one of the following gating 
(class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, 
S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).”. The current application involves an additional strength: 
Kalydeco 25 mg granules in a sachet. Dosing recommendations are as follows: Infants aged at least 6 
months, toddlers, children, adolescents and adults should be dosed according to Table below. 
Dosing recommendations for patients aged 6 months and older 
Weight  Dose  Total daily dose 
≥5 kg to < 7 kg 25 mg granules taken orally every 12 hours with fat containing food

50 mg granules taken orally every 12 hours with fat containing food 
100 mg

≥ 25 kg See Kalydeco tablets SmPC for further details. 
CF greatly affects the paediatric population, as approximately half of the total population with CF is <18 
years of age. Pancreatic destruction leading to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency begins early in life, and 
lung involvement is manifested by pulmonary inflammation and infection that begins shortly after birth. 
There are published data that support that early treatment (e.g., early nutritional support, including 
pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and other measures) improves the outcome of children with 
cystic fibrosis.  There is therefore an expectation that by treating young children early in life with CFTR 
modulators such as ivacaftor this may have an impact on disease progression and prolong survival. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is currently no fully effective cure for CF. The majority of CF therapies available including nutritional 
supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics target the downstream consequences and symptoms of the 
disease. The CFTR modulators such as ivacaftor are small molecules that target the functional defect of 
the mutant CFTR protein. They are not intended as a replacement for or an alternative to any of the 
current non-modulator therapies and therefore are to be administered on top of the standard of care. 
These CFTR modulators are not a cure for CF and must be taken chronically for the patient to maintain 
treatment benefits.   
Kalydeco is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of patients aged at least 12 months of age with 
the certain CFTR gating mutations.  
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 64/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The extension of the indication of Kalydeco to children with CF aged 6 to less 12 months who have a 
pre-specified CFTR gating mutation in at least an allele of the CFTR gene is based on a report (Interim 
Analysis 2 Report) that describes PK, safety and efficacy data from children enrolled in Cohort 2 (Part A) 
and Cohort 6 (Part B) of study 124. Study 124 is ongoing (as it continues to enrol children below 6 months 
of age) open-label, two-part study in neonates, infants and toddlers less than 2 years. In Part A, which is 
intended to assess the PK and safety, the current study protocol plans that subjects receive ivacaftor 
granules based on body weight (25, 50 or 75 mg BID) for 4 days. During Part B, ivacaftor doses (adjusted 
if needed based on results of Part A) are administered for 24 weeks which allows assessing short-term 
safety (primary endpoint) and efficacy (tertiary endpoint). Cohorts 2 and 6 only enrolled children aged 6 
to less than 12 months. All subjects who completed 24 weeks of treatment in Part B are eligible to enrol 
in an uncontrolled extension study (Study 126) which will provide 96 weeks of ivacaftor treatment. 
Children under 2 years of age with confirmed cystic fibrosis disease who are clinically stable are being 
enrolled. Key exclusion criteria are the presence of abnormal liver function at screening or any prior 
history of clinically relevant elevated (>2 × upper limit of normal [ULN]) serum aspartate transaminase 
(AST), serum alanine transaminase (ALT), or bilirubin) and lung colonization with organisms associated 
with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A consistent effect in sweat chloride has been observed in all pivotal trials of ivacaftor in older subjects 
with class III gating mutations. This is also the case of infants in cohort 6 of study 124 in which treatment 
with ivacaftor resulted in a rapid reduction at Week 2 that was sustained to Week 24 as shown by a mean 
(SD) absolute change from baseline of -58.6 mmol/L (16.5) (n = 6) providing support for extrapolation of 
efficacy from older subjects.  At Week 24, 3 subjects had a sweat chloride value <35 mmol/L, including 
1 subject who had a sweat chloride value <30 mmol/L which is the diagnostic cut-off for normal sweat 
chloride. Mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at Week 24 in weight-for-age z-score, length-for-age 
Z-score, and weight-for-length-for-age  Z-score were 0.36 (0.54), 0.27 (1.34), and 0.26 (1.30), 
respectively.  
Markers of pancreatic exocrine function such as faecal elastase-1 (FE-1) and the immunoreactive trypsin 
and/or trypsinogen (IRT) also showed a pattern of change with treatment that suggests that indeed 
ivacaftor is able to improve pancreatic exocrine function. In seven infants with both baseline and Week 24 
values who were pancreatic insufficient at baseline (defined as FE-1 < 200 μg/g), the mean (SD) absolute 
change was 203.1 μg/g (147.3). For the remaining parameters measured such IRT, total amylase, lipase, 
and faecal calprotectin, the changes in levels while on ivacaftor treatment seem consistent with that seen 
in FE-1.   
Available data in the literature confirm the findings of the pivotal studies of ivacaftor, particularly in 
subjects older than the ones enrolled in study 124. The PASS study requested at the time of MA of 
Kalydeco in which long-term safety and effectiveness measures were assessed showed that in the UK and 
US registries where this study was conducted, ivacaftor-treated patients had a lower prevalence of 
CF-related complications and select microorganisms and had better preserved lung function. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The dose finding in these young infants is based on targeting the adult dose that has been shown to be 
efficacious in the pivotal studies in older paediatric subjects and in adult subjects. This is acceptable, 
however the initial population PK model selected to support dosing recommendations for children below 
12 months of age did not take into account any influence of CYP3A4 maturation on ivacaftor clearance. 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 65/73 
 
  
 
 
 
Given that only one child in Part A/Cohort 2 had been  dosed with 25 mg BID, the MAH was requested  to 
update the model with PK data of younger children (below 6 months of age and/or below 5 kg of body 
weight) and to further discuss the potential influence of CYP3A4 maturation on ivacaftor clearance. This 
was done and additional models were developed and discussed. Of these, an empirical model with 
maturation function is the one that best describes the observed PK data in infants aged 6 to less than 12 
months of age. The simulations based on Model 2 (fixed exponent allometric scaling, no maturation) and 
Model 4 (empirical with maturation effect) would lead to the same dosing recommendations as currently 
proposed.  
The level of evidence of an interim analysis in two cohorts of an open-label study is limited by the lack of 
a control arm, the size of the cohort 6 (n=11), the duration of treatment and the uncertainty on whether 
the improvements observed are maintained. The lack of a control group raises uncertainty regarding the 
accuracy of the effect of ivacaftor in the target population as there may be many confounders, particularly 
in what refers to the anthropometric parameters that cannot be accounted for. Furthermore, additional 
information was requested that added to the uncertainties about the reliability of the results on 
anthropometric parameters. The proposal for the SmPC is to pool the results of the anthropometric 
parameters of children aged 12 to less than 24 months and of those from 6 to less than 12 months. This 
is acceptable but at the time of submission of the final results of Study 124 individual data of all subjects 
enrolled in Part B of this study may lead to an amendment of the SmPC amended as applicable. As for the 
markers of pancreatic exocrine function such as IRT or markers of intestinal inflammation such as faecal 
calprotectin, the lack of a control group and/or of normative data makes it difficult to interpret the data 
from a quantitative point of view and consequently these data are not reflected in the SmPC.  
Lung function correlates with mortality in CF patients. There are no firm data to support lung function 
improvement (as spirometry cannot be performed at this age and LCI could be measured in a single infant 
in this study) or a slower rate of decline of lung function when starting treatment as early as of 6 months. 
This can be, however, hypothesised based on already existing long-term data in older subjects, but needs 
further confirmation. While long term data would be highly desirable to establish a definitive beneficial 
effect of ivacaftor on lung function and microbiological endpoints and to confirm positive results on 
nutrition in very young children, this cannot be addressed in the frame of a registration clinical trial, 
particularly if there is evidence of clinical benefit in older subjects. 
Regarding extrapolation of efficacy the main uncertainty refers to the heterogeneity of target organs and 
the progression of the disease over time which lead to clinical manifestations that vary according to age 
and require efficacy endpoints tailored to the age of the population considered. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Ivacaftor is generally considered safe and well tolerated in older patients. Adverse drug reactions 
identified from previously completed studies include nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, 
headache, nasal congestion, oropharyngeal pain, rash, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. Most of these 
ADRs are mild to moderate in severity and do not lead usually to treatment discontinuation.  
Other adverse reactions include elevated transaminases and cataracts (lens opacities). These risks are 
properly managed through product labelling, including recommendations of close monitoring of 
unexplained elevations in transaminase levels until resolution. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological 
examinations are recommended in paediatric patients treated with ivacaftor.  
Safety results in subjects 6 to less than 12 months of age in Study 124 were generally consistent with 
those in older subjects, with no new safety concerns identified. The most common AEs were cough, 
pyrexia, vomiting and upper respiratory tract infection. Three serious adverse events were reported, i.e., 
viral rash, cough, and viral respiratory tract infection but they were not considered to be related to the 
EMA/613823/2019  
Page 66/73 
 
  
 
 
 
study drug. Transaminase (ALT) elevation (>3 x to ≤5 x ULN) was seen in a single subject who was kept 
on ivacaftor treatment. Four events of rash were reported. There was no need to change the dose in three 
of the cases but in one case treatment had to be discontinued and could be resumed later on. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database in the target paediatric population is limited in terms of size and drug exposure: only 
safety data from 11 children between 6 and 12 months of age from study 124 are available treated for 24 
weeks with ivacaftor 50 mg BID. This precludes to properly characterising safety from a quantitative point 
of view as only the most frequent adverse reactions could be detected. Furthermore, CYP3A4 maturation 
may occur at a different pace in subjects of the same age. In addition to that, there are a number of 
CYP3A4 variants for which the rates of non-expressors in the population may be relatively high. This adds 
further uncertainty to the conclusions that could be reached based on the present data, particularly when 
the proposed dosing recommendations for infants with moderate hepatic impairment or receiving 
concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are considered. No safety data are 
available in these two populations given that prior or concomitant use with moderate or strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors was an exclusion criterion as it was the presence of abnormal liver function at screening or any 
prior history of clinically relevant elevation (> 2 x ULN) in ALT, AST or bilirubin. Non-specific biochemical 
abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT, AST, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) are very common 
during the first years of life in children with CF. Most of these elevations tend to be of limited magnitude 
in the absence of intercurrent illnesses. The above criterion leads to the (apparently unnecessary) 
exclusion of children who may benefit from treatment on the basis of safety concerns in spite of the fact 
that these are very common in clinical practice.   
At the present time and even taking into account the current acceptance of the proposed posology for 
infants aged 6 to less than 12 months, some concerns remain regarding the use of ivacaftor at the 
proposed doses in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment or receiving concomitant administration of 
moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Therefore the MAH, as requested, included a cautionary sentence 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC to highlight that there are no safety data in children aged 6 to less than 12 
months of age in these two situations.    
Additional safety data are being generated in the ongoing open-label study 126 for 96 weeks. At the time 
of the cut-off data (09 April 2019), 63 children had been enrolled in Study 126. Twenty-eight out of these 
63 children rolled over from Study 124.  Most of them were 12 to < 24 months of age (n=24) and 4 were 
≥ 24 months.  The MAH confirmed that no new safety concerns had been identified so far and this is 
reassuring. The final CSR of study 126 will be completed in 2022. Final data from study 126 are to be 
submitted as soon as available in order to further fully assess if the safety profile of Kalydeco in this young 
population.

Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Studies performed in children diagnosed following newborn screening suggest that early intervention is 
associated to improved outcomes. Therefore, there is an expectation that early treatment in life, 
particularly with the CFTR modulators that target the functional defect of the mutant CFTR protein, may 
translate in slowing disease progression. However, a clear demonstration of efficacy in these very young 
children is hampered by the absence of endpoints that are sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in 
response to treatment. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis. 
However, in very young children with preserved lung function conventional tests (such as spirometry) are

Page 70/73 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not sufficiently sensitive. Alternative tests such as the Lung Clearance Index (LCI) or imaging techniques 
(e.g., CT scan) would be required to detect the initial changes in lung function or the structural changes 
present in the lung since birth. Each of these present their own problems such as the potential need for 
sedation, the requirement for specific equipment and training (LCI) or the risk of radiation (CT scan). 
Pulmonary exacerbations, a clinical relevant endpoint in older subjects with cystic fibrosis, is not of help 
either to assess response to treatment as very young children (usually) experience a limited number of 
these events. In addition, showing that disease progression is halted requires a prolonged period of 
follow-up that cannot be performed pre-authorisation, particularly when data are available supporting the 
beneficial effect of ivacaftor in older subjects.  
Given that in very young children the most prominent features of the disease are those of the 
gastrointestinal tract, demonstration of a favourable effect on nutritional status and pancreatic function 
would support the benefit of treatment.  Interim results from Study 124 demonstrated that ivacaftor 
improves CFTR function in infants aged 6 to less than 12 months who have a mutation that causes CFTR 
gating defects, with a clear positive effect on sweat chloride. This seems also to be the case for markers 
of exocrine pancreatic function (particularly faecal elastase-1). Consistent trends with that seen in faecal 
elastase-1 have been observed in other biomarkers of gastrointestinal function and inflammation 
although for some of them age-related variations have been described which would require an age 
matched control group for a correct interpretation. Anthropometric parameters are also important as a 
reflection of the nutritional status but they are difficult to interpret if no additional data are provided (e.g. 
haematological markers of nutritional status, body composition, daily intake and appetite etc.). These 
data are included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Final results of Study 124 along with individual data are 
awaited for all children enrolled in Part B of the study.      
No new AEs were identified in Cohorts 2 or 6 of study 124 and the safety profile was consistent with that 
known for older patients with class III gating mutation for whom data on long term are available. 
However, the safety database in the target paediatric population is limited in terms of size and drug 
exposure, i.e., only safety data from 17 children between 6 and 12 months of age from study 124 are 
available and only 11 out of them were treated for approximately 24 weeks with ivacaftor 50 mg BID. This 
precludes to properly characterising the safety profile from a quantitative point of view as only frequent 
adverse reactions could be detected. 
Furthermore, CYP3A4 maturation may occur at a different pace in subjects of the same age. In addition 
to that, there are a number of CYP3A4 variants for which the rates of non-expressors in the general 
population are relatively high. This adds further uncertainty to the conclusions that could be reached 
based on the present safety data, particularly when the proposed dosing recommendations for infants 
with moderate hepatic impairment or receiving concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors are considered.  
There are no safety data available in these two populations as prior or concomitant use with strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors was an exclusion criterion as it was the presence of abnormal liver function at screening 
or any prior history of clinically relevant elevation (> 2 x ULN) in ALT, AST or bilirubin. At the present time 
and even taking into account the current acceptance of the proposed posology for infants aged 6 to less 
than 12 months, some concerns remain regarding the use of ivacaftor at the proposed doses in subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment or receiving concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors. To raise this uncertainty to the prescriber the MAH, as requested, included a cautionary 
sentence in section 4.4 of the SmPC to highlight that there are no safety data in children aged 6 to less 
than 12 months of age in these two situations.    
No safety data from the long term extension study (study 126) have been presented in the current 
submission. Upon request the MAH updated this information. At the time of the cut-off data (09 April 
2019), 63 children (including the novo patients) were enrolled in Study 126. Twenty-eight out of these 63

children rolled over from Study 124.  Most of them, were 12 to < 24 months of age (n=24) and 4 were ≥ 
24 months.  The MAH confirmed that no new safety concerns had been identified at that time which is 
reassuring. The final CSR of study 126 will be completed in 2022.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Cystic fibrosis represents an area of unmet medical need for specific targeted therapies. Study 124 is an 
uncontrolled study with safety and PK as primary endpoints. According to ICH E11 (Clinical Investigation 
of Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population) “when a medicinal product is to be used in younger 
paediatric patients for the same indication(s) as those studied in older paediatric patients, the disease 
process is similar, and the outcome of therapy is likely to be comparable, extrapolation of efficacy from 
older to younger paediatric patients may be possible. In such cases, pharmacokinetic studies in the 
relevant age groups of paediatric patients likely to receive the medicinal product, together with safety 
studies, may be sufficient to provide adequate information for paediatric use.” Based on the reduction of 
sweat chloride extrapolation of efficacy has been accepted. In this situation PK and safety data are the 
main elements supporting the adequacy of the data. In this particular case, the adequacy of dosing 
recommendations for children aged 6 to less than 12 months was initially questioned as the pop-PK 
models initially selected to support the dose regimen did not incorporate any maturation function. Further 
models were developed and it has been concluded that both weight and age (maturation) need to be 
taken into account but the influence of weight seems to be more relevant than that of the age in infants 
aged 6 to less than 12 months. Therefore, dosing recommendations as proposed by the MAH are 
considered acceptable. However, a concern exists regarding the proposed posology for children with 
moderate hepatic impairment or receiving concomitant treatment with moderate or strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors. To address this concern the MAH, as requested, included a cautionary sentence in section 4.4 
of the SmPC to highlight that there are no safety data in children below 12 months of age in these two 
situations.  This was proposed taking into account that CYP3A4 maturation may occur at a different pace 
in subjects of the same age, the unknown effect of CYP3A4 polymorphisms, and the lack of safety data in 
these two situations given that they were exclusion criteria in Study 124.    
The safety database provided is limited both in terms of size and length of exposure and this has an 
obvious impact on the characterisation of the safety profile of ivacaftor in these young children. However, 
it is reassuring that no new AEs had been identified in study 124 compared to what it is already known for 
older patients with class III gating mutations. The already agreed open label extension study 126 will 
provide additional safety data for 96 weeks.  
At the time of the cut-off data (09 April 2019), 63 children had been enrolled in Study 126. Twenty-eight 
out of these 63 children rolled over from Study 124.  Most of them were 12 to < 24 months of age (n=24) 
and 4 were ≥ 24 months.  The MAH confirmed that at that time no new safety concerns had been identified 
which is reassuring. The final CSR of study 126 will be provided upon completion in 2022, as stated in the 
RMP.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Kalydeco 25mg granules in sachet in the treatment of cystic fibrosis in 
children aged 6 to less than 12 months old is favourable in the following indication: 
Kalydeco granules are indicated for the treatment of infants aged at least 6 months, toddlers and children 
weighing 5 kg to less than 25 kg with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one of the following gating (class III) 
mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or 
S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The RMP (version 8.3) is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor updates in the Product Information. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Kalydeco subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

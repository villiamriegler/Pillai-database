1.  Information on the procedure 
Metformin, alone or in combination with other medicines, is considered the first choice in the treatment 
for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and it is widely used in the EU. Currently the use of metformin in 
patients with renal failure is not harmonised across the EU, being contraindicated in patients with 
different stages of moderate renal failure depending on the member state and product. It is considered 
in the interest of the Union that the adequacy of the current recommendations for metformin 
containing products is re-evaluated with respect to the use in patients with moderate renal failure, 
taking into account the available information on the risk of lactic acidosis. These patients form a large 
population which currently may have not access to the benefits of metformin across the Union.  
On 25 January 2016 the Netherlands therefore triggered a referral under Article 31 of Directive 
2001/83/EC, and requested the CHMP to assess the impact of the above concerns on the benefit-risk 
balance of metformin containing products and to issue an opinion on whether the relevant marketing 
authorisations should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Introduction 
Metformin is indicated in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in adults, particularly in 
overweight patients, when dietary management and exercise alone does not result in adequate 
glycemic control. Metformin is considered the first choice in the treatment for T2DM and it is widely 
used in the EU.  
Metformin may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic agents or with 
insulin. Metformin-containing medicines have been authorised in the EU either nationally or through 
the centralise procedure from 1959 to 2014. Metformin is available as 250 mg, 500 mg, 850 mg and 
1000 mg tablets. This referral covers all medicines containing metformin, either as a single agent or in 
combination: 
Metformin single agent (originator product Glucophage) 
Pioglitazone/metformin (Competact, Glubrava) 
Dapagliflozin/metformin (Ebymect, Xigduo) 
Sitagliptin/metformin (Efficib, Janumet, Ristfor, Velmetia) 
Linagliptin/metformin (Jentadueto) 
Saxagliptin/metformin (Komboglyze) 
Alogliptin/metformin (Vipdomet) 
Canagliflozin/metformin (Vokanamet) 
Vildagliptin/metformin (Eucreas, Icandra, Zomarist) 
Empagliflozin/metformin (Synjardy) 
Glibenclamide/metformin (Glucovance)  
Lactic acidosis is an adverse drug reaction associated with the use of metformin. It is a very rare but 
serious metabolic complication that can occur with metformin accumulation, being associated with a

high mortality rate in the absence of prompt treatment. Because metformin is cleared by the kidneys, 
it may accumulate when renal function decreases, with the potential for exposure-dependent toxicity 
that could precipitate lactate accumulation.  
The different stages of renal function are as follows:

GFR (ml/min)

Severe renal impairment 
* All GFR values are normalized to an average surface area (size) of 1.73m2. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 
defined as either kidney damage or GFR < 60 ml/min for 3 for more months.  
In order to provide a safety margin to minimise the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, 
stringent prescribing criteria based on kidney function were implemented in the EU in 2001 following a 
previous referral procedure. During this procedure, the product information of metformin containing 
medicinal products in the EU was revised to include a contra-indication in all patients with moderate 
and severe renal impairment. 
In 2014, a worksharing variation procedure was finalised for the brand leader product Glucophage 
concluding on the extension of the use in moderate renal failure Stage 3a (GFR 45-59ml/min).  
In December 2015, during a recent Periodic Safety Update Report Single Assessment (PSUSA) 
procedure for metformin it became apparent that the product information of metformin containing 
products with regards to the cut-off value for creatinine clearance where metformin is contra-indicated 
was not consistent between member states and among metformin containing products. In addition, 
there were a number of metformin containing products, including fixed dose combinations (FDC), 
where both moderate Stages 3a and 3b (GFR < 60 mL/min) were still contra-indicated for use. 
Moreover, the current product information approved in the EU for the use of metformin containing 
medicinal products significantly differs from the therapeutic recommendations in the majority of 
European and international treatment guidelines in diabetes mellitus that recommend the use of 
metformin in all stages of moderate renal impairment. 
In view of the above, taking into account that metformin is the considered the first choice in the 
treatment for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the EU,  the Netherlands considered that it was in the 
interest of the Union to re-evaluate the adequacy of the current contra-indication of metformin in 
patients with moderate renal impairment of all metformin containing products taking into account the 
available data on the risk of lactic acidosis, and to refer the matter to the Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP). An overview of the relevant information for the discussion is 
presented hereinafter, including clinical data submitted by marketing authorisation holders.  
2.2.  Data on pharmacokinetics 
Metformin is exclusively eliminated unchanged in the urine. About 90% of absorbed metformin is 
eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours. In healthy subjects (GFR >90 mL/min) the 
plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2) of metformin is approximately 5 hours, and there is minimal

accumulation of metformin with multiple dosing (Graham et al. 2011). At usual clinical doses and 
schedules, metformin steady-state plasma concentrations are generally <1.5 μg/ml. Maximum 
metformin plasma levels during controlled clinical trials do not generally exceed 5μg/ml (Frid et al. 
2010). 
In subjects with renal impairment, metformin renal clearance is decreased leading to an increase in 
metformin systemic exposure. Table 1 shows systemic exposure of metformin in patients with T2DM 
and moderate renal insufficiency compared with normal renal function (Sambol et al. 1995). There are 
higher plasma Cmax and AUC of metformin in subjects with renal impairment compared to the healthy 
subjects. Mean plasma metformin Cmax was approximately 3-fold higher in subjects with moderate or 
severe renal impairment. Similarly, mean metformin AUC was up to 5.8 times higher in subjects with 
moderate or severe renal impairment.

The expected systemic exposure of metformin in patients with different stages of renal function, has 
been simulated using a population PK (PPK) model based on pooled data from three studies with a 
Assessment report

Page 5/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
total of 4,895 metformin plasma concentrations from both T2DM patients and healthy subjects (Duong, 
Kumar, et al. 2013). The simulations aimed for a Css,av of 1.5 µg/ml and was restricted not to exceed 
5 µg/ml as upper therapeutic limit. The study concluded that metformin plasma concentrations are 
kept below 5 µg/ml when used at a daily dose of 1000mg/day for GFR of 30ml/min and 2000mg/day 
for GFR up to 60 ml/min.  
Another pharmacokinetic model (Adam and O'Brien 2014) is based on linear regression analysis 
between metformin CL and CLCR and assuming a bioavailability of 60%. This study suggested a 
threshold of the metformin plasma concentration of <10 mg/l, no dose limitation at an GFR≥ 
40ml/min, with a maximum of 2000mg/day in the remaining renal impairment stage 3b. 
Relationship between plasma exposure of metformin and plasma levels of lactate 
Metformin decreases clearance of lactic acid, by inhibiting the mitochondrial oxidation, and thereby 
resulting in an increase in plasma levels of lactate. Lactic acidosis is defined as blood lactate 
concentrations above 5 mmol/l and arterial pH < 7.35 (de Groot et al. 2011).  
Samples taken arbitrarily (i.e. at random points in time) for determination of metformin exposure in 16 
patients reported with metformin associated lactic acidosis (MALA showed a range of plasma 
concentrations between 0.4-44 µg/ml following treatment with in average of 1744 mg/day metformin 
(range 850-2550 mg/day). The mean GFR was calculated to 20 ml/min (range 3-56 ml/min) at the 
time for admission (compared to 44 ml/min  (range 5-98 ml/min ) estimated at an earlier time point 
pre-admission (van Berlo-van de Laar, Vermeij, and Doorenbos 2011). 
Three cases of MALA, in patients with renal impairment, reported lactate levels of 14-25 mM and 
determined plasma concentrations of metformin of 42-85 µg/ml following daily doses of 1700-2000 
mg. As no data or information on time for administration in relationship to time for determination of 
the plasma levels, of lactate and metformin are available, no conclusions can be drawn on potential 
relationships (Runge et al. 2008). 
In addition, in the PPK model by (Duong, Kumar, et al. 2013) no correlation was found between 
metformin Cav,as and lactate. In the few subjects with elevated plasma lactate levels lactic acidosis was 
ruled out. Moreover, according to (DeFronzo et al. 2016), whether systemic plasma levels of metformin 
can help in predicting the risk of lactic acidosis remains unclear. 
Study EMR200084-622: Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of metformin in CKD 
In a non-comparative, open-label pilot phase II study (EMR200084-622) submitted by Merck, T2DM 
patients with different stages of CKD (stages 1-5), not treated with metformin before, were included to 
receive repeated dosing with different dosing regimens and the systemic exposure of metformin was 
determined 12h after the last dose. 
Other inclusion criteria included a renal function control at least 3 months before start of study to 
ensure a stable renal function (less than 30% of fluctuation in the last three months), age 18-80 years. 
Exclusion criteria were severe hepatic failure, other liver function impairment, unstable or missing 
renal function control, need for X-ray with contrast medium injection during study, pregnancy, 
lactation, hypersensitivity to metformin or any acute systemic illness with lactate concentration > 2.5 
mmol/l. All patients underwent at least 3 one week-blocks of metformin treatment at an increasing 
dosage.

Metformin was administered to 76 patients, including 14 in renal impairment stage 3a and 16 in 3b, 
respectively, and was effective in lowering blood glucose in a dose dependent-way in the different 
stages of renal impairment, with a maximum at 2000 mg for stage 1 and 4; and 1000 mg in stage 5. 
Metformin levels were not exceeding the threshold of 5mg/l in all patients except three patients with 
2000mg/day in CKD stage 4 and 5, respectively (see Table 3). Of note the metformin plasma 
concentrations in phase II (the maximum proposed dose of 1000mg/day) only rose significantly in CKD 
stage 4, but not in 3a or 3b.

Table 3. Steady state trough data following repeated metformin dosing with 500 mg qpm, 500 mg bid, 
1000 mg bid and 1000 mg qam + 2000 mg qpm during one week, with a wash-out period of one week 
between each regimen. 
None of the patients experienced critical lactate levels as per definition (>5mmol/l) (de Groot et al. 
2011). A total of four patients experienced a lactate level above the criterion of metformin withdrawal 
(>2.5mmol/l). However, in those patients, the increase in lactate level was only modest. The maximal 
value was 3mmol/l in one single CKD 3a patient at the end of the phase 2 (1000mg metformin/day). 
The investigator nevertheless decided to continue metformin therapy in the latter cases because of 
intolerance to other antidiabetic agents, and of the absence of metformin accumulation (plasma 
metformin level of 1.8 mg/l). In the following phase with double metformin daily dose, lactate value 
(phase 3, 2000mg/day) in the same patient was not below 2.5 mmol/l, thus indicating other causes of

lactate elevation. Moreover, lactate values were not increased in the patients having the highest 
metformin levels (> 5mg/l). 
The increase in metformin levels was only more pronounced in CKD 4 to 5 patients, and even more, 
plasma metformin levels only exceptionally exceeded 5mg/l, which was not accompanied by 
hyperlactemia (lactate >2.5mg/dl). In parallel, the hyperlactemia observed in four patients was not 
accompanied by high metformin plasma levels, demonstrating that there was no relation between the 
highest metformin values and the highest lactate values. 
Dose recommendations in moderate renal impairment 
In the literature the use of metformin in patients with renal impairment it has been widely reported 
using a decreased dosing regimen. However there are no clear and univocal recommendations on 
metformin dosages in patients with renal impairment. A summary of the main references is included in 
Table 4 below.

In  addition,  the  majority  of  European  and  international  treatment  guidelines  recommend  the  use  of 
metformin in moderate renal impairment: 
- 
Boden Institute National Evidence Based Guideline for Blood Glucose Control in T2DM 
(Colagiuri S 2009): contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR<30ml/min) 
and should be used with caution in people with moderate renal impairment (GFR of 30-
45ml/min). 
Assessment report

Page 9/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE 2015): recommends using metformin 
with caution in patients, in whom the serum creatinine exceeds 130µmol/l or GFR is less than 
45ml/min. Doses should be lower and prescribed with increased frequency of monitoring. In 
patients already taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued if the serum creatinine 
exceeds 150µmol/L or GFR falls below 30ml/min. 
- 
The Expert Consensus on Management of Diabetic Patients with Impairment on Renal Function 
(Bonnet et al. 2011): recommended to reduce the metformin dosage when the creatinine 
clearance is between 60 and 30ml/min. Metformin must be withdrawn in a creatinine clearance 
below 30ml/min. 
- 
- 
Italian Diabetes societies AMD and SID (Bruno et al. 2011): allow using metformin with caution 
up to an GFR of 30ml/min; metformin should not be used below these values. 
American Diabetes Association (ADA) (Tuttle et al. 2014): increased monitoring of renal 
function in CKD stage 3 is recommended. A lower dose, together with close monitoring of renal 
function, are recommended in CKD stage 3b. In the latter case, namely CKD 3b, patients 
should not be initiated on metformin. This precaution is made in order to give patients the 
possibility of a beneficial treatment that has been safely used at less severe CKD, without 
putting patients at this stage at risk of intolerance. 
- 
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (Handelsman et al. 2011) : in the Medical 
Guidelines for Clinical Practice for Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan, 
metformin is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (stage IV and 5, GFR<30ml/min). 
Otherwise, metformin should be used with caution in renal impairment. 
-  Norwegian National Diabetes Guidelines (Claudi T 2009). Prevention, Diagnostics and 
Treatment: contraindicates metformin at GFR <40ml/min, with no dose adjustment in stage 
IIIa. 
- 
French HAS / ANSM diabetes treatment guideline (ANSM 2013): contraindicates metformin in 
GFR below 30 ml/min (stage 4 and 5), recommends daily doses below 1500mg metformin in  
30 to 60 ml/min (stage 3), together with frequent control of renal function. 
- 
The clinical practice guideline in the management of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney 
disease stage 3b or higher (GFR <45ml/min) was published by the ERA-EDTA (European Renal 
Association / European Dialysis and Transplant Association) (ERA 2015). Metformin is 
recommended as first line agent in a dose adapted to the renal function, when lifestyle 
measures alone are insufficient to lower HbA1c to the desired range. The committee has based 
their recommendation on the most positive benefit amongst all treatment classes. A maximum 
daily dose of 850 to 1500 mg/day for CKD stage 3b is suggested. In CKD stage 4, 500mg/day 
should not be exceeded. 
- 
For the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes), the available evidence suggest 
that the dose of metformin should be reduced to a maximum of 1000 mg per day when the 
GFR reaches 45 ml/min, and should generally be discontinued when the GFR reaches 30 
ml/min. The use of metformin may be appropriate in patients with even more advanced CKD 
(GFR 15–29 ml/min) if the kidney disease is stable and if alternative treatments to manage 
glycemia are unavailable or produce significant side effects. The work group proposed that 
Assessment report

pharmacokinetic studies should be performed in patients with diabetes and CKD to provide the 
evidence to support the proposed change in usage (Molitch et al. 2015). The KDIGO guideline 
has also proposed to change the FDA guidelines. 
Conclusions on pharmacokinetics and dosing recommendation in moderate 
renal impairment 
In literature the therapeutic plasma concentration of metformin is reported to be <2 µg/ml. Patients 
with renal impairment are expected to have lower clearance and a higher systemic exposure compared 
to patients with normal renal function. Data are consistent across publications, for subjects with 
moderate renal impairment a 2 to 2.5 fold higher systemic exposure and for subjects with moderate to 
severe renal impairment, a 2 to 4 fold higher systemic exposure are reported. Other potential sources 
of PK variability are age or polymorphisms of metformin transporters. Population PK modelling has 
been performed and these models confirm that metformin exposure increases with decreasing renal 
function. 
Although there are no clear and univocal recommendations on metformin dosages in patients with 
renal impairment, based on the observed increase of exposure with decreasing renal function and the 
results of the PPK modelling studies, it has been shown that metformin plasma concentrations remain 
within the expected therapeutic range when administered at 2000 mg/day and 1000 mg/day doses in 
patients with moderate renal impairment Stage 3a (GFR 45 - 59 ml/min) and Stage 3b (GFR 30 - 45 
ml/min), respectively. 
Study EMR200084-622 has also demonstrated a gradual increase of metformin mean plasma increase 
parallel to the metformin dose, with metformin plasma concentrations using a dose of 1000mg/day 
only increasing significantly in CKD stage 4, but not in stages 3a or 3b. In this study plasma lactate 
values in the T2DM patients, with different degrees of renal impairment, were determined at the same 
time points as the steady state concentrations of metformin. Daily doses of 1000 mg/day in patients 
with moderate renal impairment (CKD grade 3a and 3b) did not increase lactate levels. 
The assessment of the overall data presented has shown that there is no clear relationship between 
metformin concentration and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis seems to occur more 
frequently with higher exposure, however other conditions (e.g., severe infection, respiratory disease, 
liver disease) increase the risk of lactic acidosis. No information is available on dosing regimen or on 
time for administration in relation to time for plasma sampling, therefore no conclusions can be drawn 
on potential relationship systemic exposure of metformin and the risk of lactic acidosis. 
In conclusion, metformin has been used regularly in patients with moderate renal impairment at 
maximum daily doses that were not causing significant metformin or lactate plasma elevations. In 
addition, recent literature and clinical guidelines in the treatment of T2DM recommend the use of 
metformin in moderate renal impairment. As there is a clear relationship between renal function and 
metformin exposure, a recommendation for a daily dose of 2000 mg/day and 1000 mg/day dose in 
patients with moderate renal impairment stages 3a and 3b, respectively, can be concluded from the 
data provided. 
2.3.  Data on efficacy 
Metformin is a first-line therapy for patients with T2DM (Inzucchi et al. 2012). Metformin reduces the 
risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in patients with normal or mildly reduced renal 
function (UKPDS 1998; Ekstrom et al. 2012; Holman et al. 2008; Roussel et al. 2010). 
Assessment report

Metformin is a biguanid agent which lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin 
inhibits the production of hepatic glucose (gluconeogenesis), reduces intestinal glucose absorption and 
improves cellular glucose uptake and utilization. Lowering blood glucose with metformin in T2DM does 
not cause hypoglycaemia (Arnouts et al. 2014). The efficacy of metformin in the treatment of T2DM 
has been extensively studied. Besides lowering the blood glucose level metformin may have additional 
beneficial effects such as weight reduction (Malin and Kashyap 2014), lowering of plasma lipid levels 
(Xu et al. 2015) and prevention of vascular complications. 
The achievement of a good glycaemic control is of great importance for preventing and delaying 
progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with both T2DM and chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). T2DM is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide (National 
Kidney 2012).  
There are data from clinical studies investigating the use of metformin in patients with CKD, however, 
long term follow up is based on observational studies from large patient cohorts with specified 
subgroup evaluations in patients with CKD. The pharmacodynamics of metformin are independent of 
the kidney and there is no reason to assume that the benefits of metformin would be reduced in 
patients with renal impairment. 
Impact on blood glucose 
In a small prospective study, 11 elderly patients with GFR<60 ml/min were treated with 850 mg 
metformin for two months, resulting in good glycemic control and metformin and lactate blood levels 
remaining in the therapeutic range (Lalau et al. 1990). 
Another prospective study on direct effectiveness of metformin involved 35 patients with CKD stage 5 
on peritoneal dialysis (PD), with median time on PD of 31 months, and median HbA1c of 6.8%. All 
study patients were using insulin. Metformin was introduced at a daily oral dose in the range 0.5 – 
1.0g (0.5g daily being the minimum recommended therapeutic dose). Throughout the study period, 
median blood sugar median HbA1c were stable. Metformin introduction demonstrated efficacy by 
sparing approximately 30% of insulin. Furthermore, the overweight patients lost weight (Al-Hwiesh et 
al. 2014).  
Impact on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 
In the REACH study evaluating 19 691 patients with T2DM and established atherothrombosis treated 
with or without metformin, the adjusted hazard ratio for 2-years mortality was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.65-
0.89;p<0.01) overall, and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.48-0.86; P = .003) in the subgroup of patients with an 
estimated GFR of 30 to 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (Roussel et al. 2010).  
Furthermore, in a large retrospective study with 51,675 men and women with T2DM registered in the 
Swedish National Diabetes Register, metformin compared to other oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, 
was associated with reduced risks of acidosis/serious infection (adjusted HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 
0.97) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.99), in patients with GFR 45-60 ml/min, and 
no increased risks of all-cause mortality, acidosis/serious infection or cardiovascular disease were 
found in patients with GFR 30-45 ml/ min (Ekstrom et al. 2012). 
In the Renal Insufficiency and Cardiovascular Events (RIACE) Italian Multicenter Study, evaluating 
15,773  patients with T2DM, metformin was independently associated with lower prevalence of 
cardiovascular disease for any age quartile and GFR category (1 = GFR≥90; 2 = 60–89; 3 = 30–59; 
and 4 ≤30ml/min) than all other treatments (Solini et al. 2013). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/539626/2016  
Page 12/29 
 
 
 
 
 
It has been stated that it may be important to take into consideration that stopping metformin in 
moderate CKD may deprive patients of metformin’s macrovascular benefits at the very time 
cardiovascular risk begins to substantially rise and that using metformin, in doses adapted to GFR in 
stable CKD, is safer than switching to other glycaemia-lowering drugs such as insulin, which might 
increase the risk of hypoglycaemia (Inzucchi et al. 2012; Herrington, Nye, and Aung 2013). 
There are several data showing that metformin is already widely used in T2DM patients with CKD stage 
3, despite current prescribing restrictions. The use has increased since 2008. In OREDIA (Observation 
of patients with renal disease and diabetes) a multi-centric study in France which analyzed the 
therapeutic management of 2.472 CKD versus 1.232 non-CKD patients (GFR > 60 ml/min) it was 
found that 63% of patients with CKD stage 3 (GFR 59-30ml/min) used metformin, and 33% with CKD 
stage 4 or 5 (GFR <30ml/min), with 31% of patients in stage 3 treated with >2000mg metformin/day 
(Penfornis et al. 2014). 
The trend of prevalence use in different CKD stages in USA has been extracted from the NHANES 
survey data. With increasing CKD, serum bicarbonate fell and serum anion gap was increased. Within 
the stages, metformin use was associated with a higher CVD risk than the comparison group, but the 
influence of renal impairment was stronger than the one of the medication. The authors did not see 
any increased risk of severe acidosis (Kuo et al. 2015). 
Conclusions on efficacy 
The number of clinical studies performed with metformin in patients with renal impairment is small, 
however several studies have confirmed that the benefits of metformin in subjects with normal renal 
function are maintained in this patient population. Metformin has been shown effective in lowering 
hyperglycemia in patient with moderate renal impairment stages 3a and 3b and in reducing the overall 
mortality. Moreover, it slows the further deterioration of renal function and provides additional 
significant micro-and macrovascular benefits. In addition, long-term epidemiological data support the 
benefits of metformin in patients with moderate renal insufficiency. 
In conclusion, the data provided together with the well-established use of metformin in patients with 
GFR 30-59 ml/min supports the clinical efficacy of metformin on blood glucose lowering for patients 
with moderate renal impairment. 
2.4.  Data on safety 
2.4.1.  Risk of lactic acidosis in patients with moderate renal impairment 
Clinical safety data 
In the large, updated Cochrane meta-analysis on metformin-associated lactic acidosis (Salpeter et al. 
2010) pooled data from 347 comparative trials and cohort studies in diabetic patients treated with 
different hypoglycemic drugs, with 70,490 patient-years of metformin use and 55,451 patient years in 
the non-metformin group no cases of lactic acidosis were found. In this analysis, 53% of prospective 
studies allowed for inclusion of renal insufficiency, but patient-level serum creatinine concentrations 
were not always available for review. Based on statistical inference, the estimated upper limit of true 
incidence was 4.3 and 5.4 cases per 100,000 patient-years in the metformin and non-metformin 
groups, respectively. This investigation suggests that “lactic acidosis is extremely rare and its incidence 
does not differ in those treated with metformin compared to other agents”.  
A second meta-analysis (Inzucchi et al. 2014) was performed on all published studies in Medline and 
Cochrane databases pertaining to metformin, kidney disease, and lactic acidosis between 1950 and 
Assessment report

June 2014. Sixty five articles were included which were pharmacokinetic / metabolic studies, large 
case series, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, and a clinical trial. The authors found that metformin 
plasma levels generally remain within the therapeutic range and lactate concentrations are not 
substantially increased when used in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 3). The 
overall incidence of lactic acidosis in metformin users varied across studies from approximately 
3/100.000 to 10/100.000 person-years and was generally indistinguishable from the background rate 
in the overall population with diabetes. The authors suggest a maximum daily dose of 1000mg 
metformin in CKD stage 3b patients and concluded that, as long as the renal function is stable and the 
patient is closely observed, metformin is unlikely to increase the risk of lactic acidosis, even in patients 
with moderate CKD (GFR 30-59ml/min). However, there is indirect evidence that a rapid drop of GFR 
can lead to a sudden accumulation of metformin. Therefore, patients should be instructed to reduce or 
stop metformin in conditions with enhanced risk of acute kidney injury, e.g. severe bouts of diarrhoea, 
or dehydration or fever. The author´s concluded also that “there have been no randomized clinical 
trials to test the specific hypothesis that metformin is safe in patients with mild to moderate CKD. 
Randomized trials would help to better inform evidence based guidelines. However, given the rarity of 
lactic acidosis in the setting of metformin therapy, a study would need to examine hundreds of 
thousands of patients for many years to demonstrate non-inferiority compared with other agents, 
which might not be feasible.”  
Data on the impact of renal insufficiency on metformin clearance during long-term use was collected by 
another study (Lalau et al. 1990). In this investigation, 24 older patients (11 in CKD stage 3, 13 in 
stage 2 or higher) were administered metformin 850 mg/day or 1,700 mg/day. After 2 months, 
metformin plasma levels remained in the therapeutic range and lactate within the reference limits in all 
participants, and both were not statistically different between those with and without renal impairment. 
In addition, another study (Frid et al. 2010) measured trough levels of metformin in serum of 137 
diabetic patients with varying renal function. There were few patients having metformin serum levels 
>20μmol/l (>~2.6μg/ml). Of the 20 patients in the 2 months follow-up group, 6 had a CKD stage 4, 
and 14 had a CKD stage 3. Median metformin level was 10μmol/l (IQR 5.3–16μmol/l). In combination 
with a previous evaluation on 7 cases of lactic acidosis with metformin levels between 33.1mg/l and 
88.1 mg/l (median 42.6mg/l), the data suggest that very high metformin levels are needed to cause 
lactic acidosis. The authors concluded that metformin may be safely used at GFR above 30ml/min. 
Furthermore, they stated that patients above this GFR limit rarely had metformin levels above 
20μmol/l, which for the authors seemed to be a safe level. 
A cross-sectional study (Al Awadhi et al. 2008) in 106 diabetic patients revealed that 30 (28%) 
patients with moderately impaired renal function (GFR <60ml/min) and five with severely impaired 
renal function (GFR <30ml/min) were safely treated with metformin. No cases of lactic acidosis were 
observed. 
Further investigations address metformin long-term safety in patients with moderate renal impairment 
(Connolly and Kesson 1996; Lim et al. 2007; Rachmani et al. 2002). These studies also found no 
increased risks in various degrees of renal insufficiency. 
The study by Hung (Hung et al. 2015) conducted a retrospective observational cohort study on type 2 
diabetic CKD stage 5 patients (defined by receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents), as documented 
in the Taiwan national health insurance research database between 2000 and 2009. Of these, 813 
patients were using metformin despite contraindication, and were matched 1:3 with non-users by 
propensity score. Mean follow-up was 2.1 years. After multivariate adjustment, metformin use was 
associated with a higher, but non-significant risk of metabolic acidosis (1.6 vs. 1.3 events per 100 
patient years, adjusted HR 1.3 (95%CI 0.88–1.93; p=0.19), which was not dose related (HR 1.8 in ≤

500mg/day, 1.4 in 500-1000mg/day and 1.5 in ≥ 1000mg/day). The number of patients proceeding to 
end-stage renal disease was significantly lower in metformin users (HR 0.76 (95%CI 0.69-0.84; 
p<0.0001). In contrast, metformin use was an independent risk factor for mortality (HR 1.35; 95%CI 
1.2- 1.51; p<0.001). The risk was dose dependent and non-significantly increased with ≤ 500mg 
metformin/day (HR 1.14 (0.85-1.44); or 500-1000mg/day HR 1.30 (0.93-1.45); but significantly 
increased at daily doses of ≥1000mg HR 1.57 (1.29-1.83), consistently across all subgroup analyses. 
A matched-case control study was carried out in the Grenoble Hospital University to evaluate the 
strength between the association between lactic acidosis and well-recognized risk factors, most 
importantly metformin (Lepelley et al. 2016). In this study 302 cases of lactic acidosis and 604 
controls were included. Metformin was not associated with a higher risk of lactic acidosis, only in the 
case of acute kidney injury (OR=1.79; p=0.020), but not in those without acute kidney injury 
(OR=0.86; p=0.628). Mild-to moderate CKD (stage 2-3) was also not associated with an increased risk 
of lactic acidosis (OR=0.36; p=0.002); only severe to end-stage CKD (OR=1.62; 0.325). The 
intercurrent diseases acute kidney injury (OR=9.58; p<0.001); acute decompensated heart failure 
(OR=3.55;p<0.001) and sepsis (OR=8.28; p<0.001) were significantly associated with lactic acidosis. 
Another study (Schernthaner and Schernthaner-Reiter 2015) calculated the HR of all-cause mortality 
for the use of metformin at different stages of CKD, taking into account the majority of the results 
presented previously, and gave respective dose recommendations (See Table 5) 
Table 5. All-cause mortality HR and recommended daily dose for metformin during different stages of 
CKD (Schernthaner, 2015) 
The study summarised that “premature cessation of metformin use in patients with renal disease might 
expose them to considerable harm. In clinical practice, we often see premature cessation of metformin 
use, which leads to poor glucose control, followed by increasing deterioration of renal function. 
Furthermore, a denial of metformin to patients with T2DM and CKD might further increase their 
already elevated risk of cardiovascular disease.” Based on their meta-analysis and available data on 
efficacy and safety, they recommend the use of metformin CKD patients including stage 3b, up to 1000 
mg/day, but not in stage 4.  
In a large, nested, case-control analysis of the UK general practice research database (Bodmer et al. 
2008), the crude incidence of lactic acidosis was 3.3 cases per 100,000 person-years among metformin 
users (with different stages of renal impairment). This study estimated the incidence in sulphonylurea 
users to be 4.8/100,000 patient-years. Relevant co-morbidities known as risk factors for lactic acidosis 
could be identified in all case subjects (Mani 2009).

By using electronic databases of hospital discharge diagnoses and laboratory results from over 41000 
person-years of exposure in three diverse US populations with T2DM, another study (Brown et al. 
1998) observed 9.7/100,000 patient-years in the time when metformin was not yet on the US market. 
A retrospective propensity score matched cohort study was conducted using the Japanese Medical Data 
Vision claims database (Chang, Sakaguchi, and Dolin 2016). T2DM patients aged 18 or above who 
received diabetes drugs during January 2010 through August 2014 were identified. Poisson regression 
and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the incidence and assess if metformin use 
was associated with increased risk of lactic acidosis. Thirty cases of lactic acidosis were identified 
among 283.491 treated T2DM patients with 504.169 patient-years of follow-up. Crude incidence of 
lactic acidosis was 5.95 per 100.000 patient-years. T2DM patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
were seven-fold more likely to develop lactic acidosis than those without CKD (adjusted hazard ratio 
(aHR), 7.33, 95%CI, 3.17–16.96). Use of metformin was not associated with risk of lactic acidosis in 
the study population (aHR, 0.92, 95%CI, 0.33–2.55), and in the propensity score matched cohort 
(aHR, 0.90, 95%CI, 0.26–3.11). Similar findings were observed among diabetes patients with chronic 
liver disease (CLD) and CKD. The age-sex adjusted incidence rates in metformin users and non-users 
were 5.80 and 5.78 per 100.000 person-years, respectively (Incidence rate ratio, 1.00, p=0.99). The 
authors concluded that use of metformin was not associated with increased risk of lactic acidosis in 
diabetic patients including those with CKD or CLD. 
A UK Clinical Practise Research Datalink (CPRD) analysis by the MAH for Glucophage was performed for 
and presented in FR/H/xxxx/WS/16, and was later published (Richy et al. 2014). In parallel, a second 
analysis from the same database was published on the same topic (Eppenga et al. 2014). Both 
investigations were carried out in a completely isolated manner, while using the same source data.  
The study by Eppenga was performed in an independent, academic setting (Radboud University 
Medical Center, The Netherlands). This study examined whether treatment with metformin was 
associated with a higher risk of lactic acidosis or elevated lactate concentrations, compared to that of 
users of other noninsulin antidiabetic (NIAD) who had never used metformin. Patients were classified 
in four groups: current, recent, past and never metformin users. 
Renal function was assessed as the mean GFR value one week to one year before exposure to 
metformin or comparators started, which might be biased by the onset of any acute renal impairment. 
The primary outcome was lactic acidosis, defined by either a CPRD Read code or a record of elevated 
plasma lactate concentrations (>5mmol/l). The study included 223,968 metformin patients who 
accounted for 743,151 person-years for current users. Overall, 68 lactic acidosis events were 
measured, 55 of which were in current metformin users (defined as at least one metformin prescription 
in the three months before the start of prescription coverage period). The crude incidence of lactic 
acidosis or elevated plasma lactate concentrations was 7.4 (95% CI: 5.6 - 9.63) per 100,000 person-
years in current metformin users and 2.2 (95% CI: 0.36 - 7.24) in never users. Given the overlap in 
the confidence interval, no significant difference could be found. Within the group of current metformin 
users, the incidence rates were 5.29 (95% CI: 3.54-7.60), 14.45 (95% CI: 7.60-24.7) and 19.65 
(95% CI: 6.38-45.80) cases per 100,000 patient-years in patients with GFR ≥ 60 (currently 
approved), 45-59 and 30-44 (moderate kidney impairment, off label) ml/min, respectively. 
The study published by (Richy et al. 2014) examined whether the metformin users in T2DM had an 
increased risk of lactic acidosis at different levels of renal impairment, as compared to metformin users 
with normal renal function. Patients with T2DM and a continuous exposure to metformin between 
January 2007 and December 2012 were included. Renal function was assessed as the most recent GFR 
value or diagnostic code before study end or outcome was detected, in order to capture the most 
severe or deteriorated baseline renal function. The primary outcome of the study was defined as lactic

acidosis evaluated by CPRD read code. Fatal cases of lactic acidosis were also assessed. The incidence 
rate of lactic acidosis in metformin patients with T2DM was assessed by renal impairment category; 
normal kidney function was the reference category for comparisons. The study included 77,601 
metformin-treated patients, accounting for 337,590 person-years. Overall, there were 35 lactic 
acidosis events with no fatal cases. The overall incidence rate of lactic acidosis in metformin users was 
10.37 per 100,000 patients-years. 
No significant difference in the incidence of lactic acidosis was observed in normal, mild (stage 2), 
moderate (stage 3), or severe renal (stage 4 and 5) impairment: 7.6 [0.9–27.5], 4.6 [2.00–9.15], 17 
[10.89– 25.79], and 39 [4.72–140.89] cases per 100,000 patient-years, respectively. Despite the 
variety of methodologies applied to the data in the two studies, the estimates were very close in 
absolute value for each GFR category, the maximum difference between stage 2 and 4/5 being 0.12%. 
In both studies, no significant difference between the rates of lactic acidosis in patients with normal, 
mild or moderate renal impairment were found, especially when taking into account the wide 
confidence intervals observed in both studies. Some trends for correlation between lactic acidosis rates 
and declining renal function could be noticed; however both studies did not adjust for comorbidities 
between the CKD stages, making it thus impossible to compensate for confounding effects. Accordingly 
in the study by Richy (2014), a clear increase of confounding conditions associated with lactic acidosis 
and declining renal function was found, which indicates that there might be other reasons unrelated to 
metformin in the increasing incidence of lactic acidosis in increasing renal impairment. 
Spontaneous case reports of lactic acidosis 
According to the EMA EudraVigilance report, there were 43,856 case reports of metformin containing 
medicinal products in EudraVigilance of which 5,476 (12.5%) referred to lactic acidosis (Standardised 
MedDRA Queries (SMQ) Broad, 1995 to 2015) (see Figure 1). The yearly trend of case reports of lactic 
acidosis showed an increase peaking in 2013, however the increase in total counts has not been 
followed by an increase in the proportion of fatal cases. Introduction of national pharmacovigilance 
regulations may have influenced the increasing reporting rates, which may also explain the decline of 
the incidence of fatality due to the additional monitoring performed.

Figure 1: Trend of reports of Lactic acidosis SMQ (Broad). Distribution of case reports (total 
and fatal) from 1995 to 2015 
The report showed that in only 31 cases GFR was reported at the time of the adverse reaction, the 
majority of case reports (17 out of 31) reported GFR group <15 ml/min. The 60-89 GFR ml/ml group 
included four case reports (12.9% of the cases with GFR information) and none of them had a fatal 
outcome. About 10% of patients (549 out of 5476) developing lactic acidosis had a reported medical 
history of renal failure. 
The MAH Merck has submitted cumulative searches of their safety databases on lactic acidosis from 
1980 to 2015. The search retrieved 3132 single cases of SMQ (Standardised MedDRA Queries) lactic 
acidosis. Overall, of the 3132 cases of this analysis, 2453 (78%) of the cases recorded the event term 
lactic acidosis. In the SMQ set of lactic acidosis, a metformin dose was provided in 2028 cases (65% of 
3132). The reported metformin dose (daily dose or intake dose in suicidal cases) ranked between 100 
mg and 270,000mg. 1793 cases (57% of 3132) provided metformin plasma concentrations. Both 
metformin and lactate plasma values were recorded in 457 cases (15% of 3132 cases). The majority 
reported a lactate of 50 mmol/l or lower, and metformin plasma concentrations below 100 mg/l. 
In 1454 cases (46% of 3132) a creatinine clearance was reported. Further analysis of the renal 
impairment was done based on ‘modification of diet in renal disease’ (MDRD) using the simplified 
equation (Levey et al. 1999; Levey et al. 2005) (See Figure 2). Around 80% (1162 of 1454) of all SMQ 
cases, in which a MDRD was deducible, were attributable to renal impairment stage 4 and 5, meaning 
severe renal impairment (GFR<30ml/min).

Spontaneous reports of lactic acidosis have been published in the literature since the first marketing 
authorisation of metformin. In more recent times, the publications often group retrospective case 
report collections from toxicology units or Health Authority compilations. 
A retrospective analysis by (Huang, Castelino, and Peterson 2015) was performed in lactic acidosis 
cases in metformin treated patients reported to the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. Of 
the 152 MALA cases, 17.4% (n=23) had a fatal outcome. Plasma lactate levels were higher in non-
survivors. Around 75% of all cases were reported to have at least one additional condition, which may 
have caused lactic acidosis. Metformin dosage, plasma lactate and serum creatinine were not related. 
An additional study (McNamara and Isbister 2015) published a retrospective case series of metformin 
overdose (n=36) cases admitted to a toxicology unit in Australia over 20 years. Median ingested dose 
was 10 g (IQR: 5– 16.1 g; range: 3.5–50 g). Blood pH and lactate levels were available in 25 of the 36 
cases. Median lowest pH was 7.35 (IQR: 7.28 to 7.38; range: 7.16 to 7.43), acidosis (pH < 7.35) 
occurred only in 11/25. Median peak lactate was 3.9 mmol/l (IQR: 2.6–5.2 mmol/l). Only five 
presentations (5/36) met the criteria for lactic acidosis. The authors concluded that most metformin 
overdoses result in minor clinical effects and do not progress to lactic acidosis, and have 
hyperlactatemia with or without acidosis. 
In a recent study (Boucaud-Maitre et al. 2016) 727 case reports were analysed from the 
pharmacovigilance database of the ANSM between 1985 and 2013 reporting lactic acidosis and 
associated with metformin. Metformin plasma concentration was presented in 260 patients, lactate in 
556 patients and pH in 502 patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/539626/2016

The authors stated that there were significant differences between surviving and deceased patients in 
lactate concentration (10.8 ± 9.5 mmol/l vs. 16.3 ±14.6 mmol/l). Whilst there was a good correlation 
between the severity of hyperlactemia or pH and fatal outcome, there was no respective increase in 
metformin concentrations >5mg/l. Consequently, the relationship of metformin, lactate and pH was 
based on 199 patients, where only lactate remained associated with mortality after adjustments of 
variables. Nevertheless, the authors deduce that metformin plasma accumulation due to acute renal 
failure may be considered the main cause of rise in lactate and fall in pH, as 30% of patients with 
supra-therapeutic metformin-concentrations of >5mg/l died, whilst 11% died with metformin <5mg/l. 
Other important risk factors for renal impairment and lactic acidosis 
Diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration 
According to a study on MALA (Duong, Furlong, et al. 2013) , acute renal failure leads to a loss of renal 
clearance of lactic acid, which may lead to lactic acidosis. This model also illustrates that the circle can 
be initiated by acute renal impairment, diarrhea / vomiting or any direct cause of lactic acidosis. And 
indeed, in a matched-case control study by (Lepelley et al. 2016), acute kidney injury was the risk 
factor most dominantly associated with lactic acidosis (OR=9.58; p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis 
stratified by acute kidney injury, those patients with a mild-to moderate CKD (stage 2-3) had a lower 
odds ratio for lactic acidosis in both the acute kidney injury and the no-comparison arm. It was only in 
severe and end-stage CKD that the OR was increased. 
Alcohol 
There is a recent population-based cohort study (Koning et al. 2015) that found that alcohol 
consumption is inversely associated with the risk of developing CKD, where the hazard ratio for CKD 
risk was 0.85 (0.69– 1.04) for occasional (under 10 g/week), 0.82 (0.69–0.98) for light (10–69.9 
g/week), 0.71 (0.58– 0.88) for moderate (70–210 g/week), and 0.60 (0.42–0.86) for heavier (over 
210 g/week) alcohol consumers (significant trend). Alcohol consumption was also found to be inversely 
related to CKD stage 3 in Taiwanese men (Hsu et al. 2013). 
In acute intoxication, alcohol dehydrates the consumer by inducing diuresis as well as volume 
depletion. Last but not least, alcohol induced gastritis causes nausea and vomiting (Jairam et al. 2014; 
Kaizu 1997; Garcia-Garcia, Jha, and World Kidney Day Steering 2015). Alcohol intoxication is therefore 
to be regarded as risk factor drug for acute renal failure. In addition, in a retrospective analysis on 
lactic acidosis, the authors found no link to alcoholism (Scale and Harvey 2011). 
Iodinated contrast media 
The number of cases that reported metformin in correlation with the administration of iodinated 
contrast media was also investigated. Iodinated contrast media were reported as co-suspect or 
concomitant drugs in 45 of 3132 cases of the SMQ lactic acidosis. In 42 cases this information is in the 
case report text, summing up to a total of 66 cases (2% of 3132), with 26 of them (39% of 66) being 
fatal. 
Only 14 cases reported metformin plasma levels, with 7 cases in the supratherapeutic range (7.6 to 50 
mg/l). Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a common complication of administration of iodinated 
contrast media. Metformin per se is not a risk factor for CIN (Benko et al. 2007), but the risk of acute 
renal function deterioration increases the risk of acute renal failure, the main risk factor for metformin 
accumulation (Tonolini, 2012). The incidence of CIN ranges from 0.1% to 13% without prior renal 
failure was 0%. In patients with previous renal failure, the incidence of CIN was 4.7%. In a very recent 
study by Li (2016), the incidence of CIN was not significantly different between patients with T2DM and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/539626/2016

patients with insulin resistance, but about 3- to 4-fold higher than in insulin sensitive patients (8.7% 
vs 6.7% vs 2.2%, P < .05). 
A retrospective cohort study (Shah et al. 2015) was conducted in patients at a San Francisco medical 
center to determine if there is a change in kidney function in patients on metformin with estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min who receive IV contrast. In the 35 patients, mean pre-
contrast GFR was 54±6 ml/min/1.73m2 and post-contrast GFR was 59±19. The authors conclude that 
the current practice of holding metformin for two days after IV contrast should be re-evaluated as 
there was no significant change in kidney function. However, the number of subjects in this 
retrospective analysis may be considered relatively too small, as the number of cases received by the 
company corresponds to an incidence rate of 0,5 per 1,000,000 patient years (66 cases within an 
exposure of 127,593,915 patient years). 
Based on the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (Stacul et al. 2011), patients receiving 
intravenous iodinated contrast medium should stop taking metformin 48h before contrast medium 
administration if their falls GFR<45ml/min. Renal function should be re-assessed 48h after contrast 
medium and metformin should only be restarted if it has not deteriorated further. The Canadian 
Association of Radiologists use a threshold of <60ml/min (Benko et al. 2007). 
In the matched-case control study by (Lepelley et al. 2016), iodinated contrast media use 
demonstrated a higher Odds ratio for lactic acidosis (OR=8.58; 95%CI 3.77-19.52; p<0.001) 
compared to metformin (OR=1.79; 95%CI 1.09-2.93; p=0.020). 
Other medicines 
In literature, medicines known to potentially induce an acute renal failure include antihypertensive 
therapy (including ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker), diuretics, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol, antibiotics, antiviral, antifungal, oncologic drugs, 
radiocontrast, calcineurin inhibitors, lithium, H2-blocker, statins, gout medication and SGLT2-inhibitors 
(Pazhayattil and Shirali 2014; McWilliam 2007; Markowitz and Perazella 2005). Health care 
professionals should be informed that other drugs may contribute to the development of lactic acidosis 
by acutely impairing the renal function. 
Other causes of lactic acidosis 
The most common associated factors with lactic acidosis include acute cardiorespiratory illnesses, 
sepsis and renal failure, and are significantly associated with mortality (Scale and Harvey 2011). It was 
therefore suggested (Lalau 2010) that the incidence of MALA could be reduced by assessing other 
associated risk factors. Indeed many of the cases of lactic acidosis report other drugs and conditions 
associated with lactic acidosis, and most cases of lactic acidosis in people taking metformin fail to 
provide adequate information to permit assessment of causation, including lactic acid concentrations 
and pH (Kajbaf and Lalau 2013). Another report (Stades et al. 2004) also showed that plasma 
concentrations of metformin were not correlated to increased lactic acid concentration. In addition, 
increased concentrations of neither lactic acid nor metformin were associated with increased mortality 
risk. In contrast, acute cardiovascular events, liver cirrhosis, and sepsis were all associated with an 
increased mortality risk. Interestingly, all but one of the cases in Stades’ review had at least one risk 
factor (cardiovascular events, pulmonary failure, hepatic failure, alcohol excess, or sepsis) for the 
development of lactic acidosis, independent of metformin use. Most of the patients developed lactic 
acidosis in the presence of acute or worsening renal failure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/539626/2016  
Page 21/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
According to a retrospective analysis of 149 cases in a general hospital, lactic acidosis most often 
occurs in diabetic patients with acute renal or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis (Scale and Harvey 
2011). There is also a number of drugs known to cause LA (Adeva-Andany et al. 2014). 
The lack of a relation between lactic acid/metformin concentrations and mortality and the absence of 
an association between metformin concentration and lactic acid concentration suggest that the 
association between lactic acidosis and metformin is coincidental, although causality cannot be ruled 
out completely (Lalau and Race 2000, 1999; Holstein and Stumvoll 2005). Physicians should be 
educated on the range of other risk factors that contribute to lactic acidosis in patients treated with 
metformin (Lalau and Race 2001). 
In a matched-case control study by (Lepelley et al. 2016), the intercurrent diseases acute kidney 
injury (OR=9.58; p<0.001); acute decompensated heart failure (OR=3.55; p<0.001) and sepsis 
(OR=8.28; p<0.001) were significantly associated with lactic acidosis, but not metformin. 
2.4.2.  Other risks of metformin besides lactic acidosis in renal impairment 
The most common side-effects observed in association with metformin use in diabetic individuals are 
mild to moderate gastrointestinal events including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and 
decreased appetite, among others. 
The majority of side-effects usually occur shortly after beginning of metformin treatment and the 
majority of patients (78%) who continue the use of metformin recover from these side-effects during 
the ongoing treatment (de Jong, Harmark, and van Puijenbroek 2016). These undesirable effects 
resolve spontaneously in most cases and can be minimised by slow up-titration or the use of the 
extended release formulation of metformin. However, vomiting and diarrhea which can occur during 
treatment start of metformin therapy may contribute to a worsening of the patients’ renal function, 
especially if severe and prolonged enough to cause dehydration. 
The gastrointestinal events might be related to the fact that metformin is a substrate of Organic Cation 
Transporter 1 (OCT1) which plays an important role in the transfer of cations from the gut lumen to 
the interstitium (McCreight, Bailey, and Pearson 2016). Metformin absorption through the enterocytes 
is in part mediated by OCT1(Han et al. 2015), and is discussed to be related with the gastrointestinal 
adverse effects of metformin (McCreight, Bailey, and Pearson 2016; Dujic et al. 2016). As OCT1 is 
probably apically expressed it is most likely to influence local concentrations of metformin in the gut 
(lumen and enterocytes), rather than its transfer into the blood. 
Other well-known adverse reactions of metformin (e.g. taste disturbance, loss of appetite, skin 
reactions such as erythema, pruritus, or urticaria, decrease of vitamin B12 and liver function tests 
abnormalities or hepatitis) as well as the important potential risk leukocytoclastic vasculitis are not 
impacting the benefit-risk especially in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
Conclusions on safety 
The use of metformin is currently contraindicated in the EU in patients with various degrees of 
moderate renal impairment due to the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a very rare and serious 
side effect that occurs most often in patients with acute renal or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. 
Metformin accumulation occurs at acute worsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic 
acidosis. Other risk factors for lactic acidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, 
inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting and any conditions associated with hypoxia, 
as well as concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause lactic acidosis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/539626/2016  
Page 22/29 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the data provided in this referral procedure, the reporting rate of lactic acidosis among 
metformin users from post-marketing has been estimated between 1 and 10 per 100.000 patient years. 
In addition, the risk of fatal outcome of lactic acidosis cases has declined over time, from around 50% 
to less than 20% in recent years. 
Recent studies have shown that it is unclear whether metformin per se is associated with an enhanced 
risk for lactic acidosis and data are conflicting. As per recent scientific survey (Kraut and Madias 2014), 
lactic acidosis is not primarily a condition caused by metformin treatment but the main causes of lactic 
acidosis are cardiogenic or hypovolemic shock, advanced heart failure, severe trauma or hypoxemia, 
sepsis, severe anemia, vigorous exercise, seizures, shivering, diabetes mellitus, cancer, liver disease, 
and other drugs that can acutely impair renal function. In addition, in the matched-case control study 
by Lepelley ((Lepelley et al. 2016)), acute kidney injury was the risk factor most dominantly associated 
with lactic acidosis (OR=9.58; p<0.001). Therefore, although causality cannot be ruled out completely, 
other causes than metformin are the most likely cause of lactic acidosis. 
Apart from lactic acidosis, the overall safety profile of metformin in patients with chronic kidney 
disease is similar to the safety profile in patients with normal renal function. 
In conclusion, the possible elevated risk of lactic acidosis could be sufficiently minimised in patients 
with GFR greater than 30 ml/min if a clear dosing recommendation, additional monitoring of GFR levels 
before and during treatment and updated warnings and precautions are described in the SmPC and 
package leaflet. 
Warnings recommended include recommendations to discontinue prior to the administration of 
iodinated contract agents which may result in metformin accumulation and an increased risk of lactic 
acidosis, or at the time of surgery until the renal function has been evaluated and found to be stable. 
In addition, some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of 
lactic acidosis as well, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE 
inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. Therefore, when 
starting or using such products in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is 
necessary. 
In addition, the CHMP was of the opinion that in order to further characterize the risk of lactic acidosis 
in patients with moderate renal impairment using metformin, routine pharmacovigilance activities 
needed to be extended to include cumulative reviews of the events of the SMQ lactic acidosis and 
targeted follow-up questionnaires including medical data available regarding any potential occurrence 
of lactic acidosis for each individual case safety report. 
2.5.  Fixed dose combinations products containing metformin 
Most of the fixed dose combinations (FDC) products have at present a contraindication in patients with 
moderate renal impairment GFR< 60 ml/min, which is related to the metformin component. The 
currently available efficacy and safety data for using these fixed combination products in patients with 
moderate to severe renal impairment is scarce. The available scientific evidence described for 
metformin as a single component is also applicable to the FDC, however several aspects need to be 
taken into account before giving a specific dose recommendation of using these combination products.  
The main aspect to be considered is the restrictions regarding renal impairment for the other active 
substance in the combination. In addition recommending a suboptimal dose of the second active 
substance should be avoided, taking into consideration the available tablet strengths for the fixed dose 
combination product for both metformin and the other active substance. Moreover, the feasibility of 
using a fixed dose combination product in patients who may need frequent dose adjustments of one or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/539626/2016  
Page 23/29 
 
 
 
 
 
two of the components due to their changing renal function needs to be considered, as the need to 
stop taking metformin acutely may be especially important in these patients. Moreover, patients using 
a combination product might be automatically left without the second active substance. In all cases if 
no adequate strength of the product is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead of 
the fixed dose combination. 
Information of dosing in moderately renally impaired patients has been reviewed and approved with 
respect to the second active substance in combination products in the context of previous procedures; 
based on these data, the following dose recommendation for fixed dose combination products 
containing metformin was agreed:  
Saxagliptin/metformin  
Saxagliptin as monocomponent may be used in patients with mild renal impairment without dose 
adjustment, whereas the dose should be reduced to 2.5 mg once daily in patients with moderate to 
severe renal impairment.  
Sitagliptin/metformin  
Sitagliptin as monocomponent may be used in patients with GFR ≥ 50 ml/min without dose 
adjustment, whereas the dose should be reduced to 50 mg once daily in patients with moderate to 
severe renal impairment. 
Vildagliptin/metformin 
Vildagliptin as monocomponent may be used in patients with GFR ≥ 50 ml/min without dose 
adjustment, whereas the dose should be reduced to 50 mg once daily in patients with moderate to 
severe renal impairment. 
Linagliptin/metformin  
Linagliptin as monocomponent may be used in patients with renal impairment without dose reduction, 
with the recommended dose being 5 mg daily.   
Alogliptin/metformin  
Alogliptin as monocomponent may be used in patients with renal impairment. For patients with mild 
renal impairment (GFR > 50 to ≤ 80 ml/min), no dose adjustment of alogliptin is necessary. In 
patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥ 30 to ≤ 50 ml/min), one-half of the recommended 
dose of alogliptin should be administered (12.5 mg once daily). 
Pioglitazone/metformin  
Pioglitazone as monocomponent may be initiated at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily and the dose may be 
increased up to 45 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal 
function. 
Glibenclamide/metformin  
Glibenclamide may be used in patients with moderate renal impairment GFR > 30 ml/min. The 
recommended dose is 1.75 mg to 10.5 mg daily. Initiation is not recommended in patients with 
moderate renal impairment Stage 3b (GFR 30-44 ml/min) due to increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Glibenclamide is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.  
Dapagliflozin/metformin  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/539626/2016  
Page 24/29 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dose is 10 mg daily. Dapagliflozin is not recommended in patients with GFR < 60 
ml/min. 
Canagliflozin/metformin  
Canagliflozin as mono-component may be used in patients with GFR > 45 ml/min, although treatment 
should not be initiated in patients with GFR < 60 ml/min. In patients with GFR 45-60 ml/minute, it is 
recommended that the canagliflozin dose of 100 mg should be used. Canagliflozin should not be used 
in patients with GFR < 45 ml/min.  
Empagliflozin/metformin  
Empagliflozin as mono-component may be used in patients with GFR > 45 ml/min, although treatment 
should not be initiated in patients with GFR < 60 ml/minute. In patients with GFR 45-60 ml/min, it is 
recommended that the empagliflozin dose of 10 mg should be used. Empagliflozin is not recommended 
in patients with GFR < 45 ml/min. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Beneficial effects 
Metformin is the first-line therapy in T2DM. For patients with T2DM overall, long-term beneficial effects 
of metformin have been demonstrated including reduction of cardiovascular risk and all-cause 
mortality. The mode of action of metformin is not dependent on kidney function and, therefore, a 
maintained efficacy is expected in patients with renal impairment provided an exposure within the 
therapeutic interval is achieved with the provided dose.  
A benefit from metformin on macrovascular outcomes and mortality is reported in the literature in 
patients with renal impairment, which is a high risk patient group for these events. Moreover, it slows 
the further deterioration of renal function and provides additional significant micro-and macrovascular 
benefits in this patient population.  
Most of the recent guidelines from learned societies based on the available literature recommend 
metformin in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min). Some propose dose 
reduction or use with caution. Most of the guidelines recommend to stop metformin as soon as the 
patients GFR falls <30 ml/min.  
Uncertainty of beneficial effects 
The therapeutic range of metformin plasma concentration is unclear, making it difficult to estimate the 
relative exposure in pharmacokinetic studies. There are no prospective randomised clinical studies on 
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with renal impairment. The use of metformin is, 
however, well-known and frequent in these patients. Consequently, efficacy data on large 
observational studies data exists in this patient group. The majority of the patients in these studies 
had GFR 45-60 ml/min and the data is somewhat more limited in patients with GFR 30-45 ml/min. 
Adjustment for important covariates and in some studies, propensity scoring have been used in these 
studies in order to minimize confounding by indication.  
Unfavourable effects 
The most common side-effects observed in association with metformin use in diabetic individuals are 
mild to moderate gastrointestinal events including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and 
decreased appetite. In most cases, these events can be minimized by slow up-titration or the use of 
the extended release formulation of metformin. However, vomiting and diarrhea which can occur 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/539626/2016  
Page 25/29 
 
 
 
 
 
during treatment start of metformin therapy may contribute to a worsening of the patients’ renal 
function, especially if severe and prolonged enough to cause dehydration. 
Metformin clearance is decreased in the setting of renal impairment. In small available studies, 
however, drug levels remain stable and within therapeutic range at reduced dose, when GFR is greater 
than 30 ml/min and do not significantly increase circulating lactate levels.  
Lactic acidosis, a serious metabolic complication, most often occurs in diabetic patients with acute 
renal or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute worsening of renal 
function and likely lowers the threshold for developing lactic acidosis. In case of dehydration (severe 
diarrhoea or vomiting, fever, heat, reduced fluid intake) temporary discontinuation of metformin and 
contact with a health care professional is recommended. Other risk factors/ causes for lactic acidosis 
are drugs that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and NSAIDs), 
excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, poorly controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting 
and any conditions associated with hypoxia. Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media 
may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, resulting in metformin accumulation and an increased risk 
of lactic acidosis. The frequency of lactic acidosis in the setting of metformin therapy as the only risk 
factor is very low. 
Uncertainty of unfavourable effects 
There have been no randomized clinical trials to test the specific hypothesis that metformin is safe in 
patients with GFR 30-60 ml/min. Available evidence include meta-analyses, retrospective studies and 
smaller mechanistic investigations. 
There were 5,476 case reports of metformin containing medicinal products in EudraVigilance that 
referred to lactic acidosis. About 10% of patients had a reported medical history of renal failure. Only a 
very small number of reported cases contained information on GFR or laboratory values to support the 
lactic acidosis diagnosis. An increased risk of lactic acidosis may be related to renal impairment 
irrespectively of metformin use. 
Based on the data provided a clear relationship between metformin concentration and the occurrence 
of lactic acidosis has not been shown. Metformin has been used regularly in patients with moderate 
renal impairment at maximum daily doses that were not causing significant metformin or lactate 
plasma elevations. Lactic acidosis seems to occur more frequently with higher exposures of metformin, 
however other conditions (e.g., severe infection, respiratory disease, liver disease) increase the risk of 
lactic acidosis. In addition, no conclusions could be drawn on potential relationship systemic exposure 
of metformin and the risk of lactic acidosis. 
Overall benefit-risk assessment 
The benefits of metformin in the treatment of T2DM in patients with moderate renal impairment have 
been demonstrated in terms of the reduction of cardiovascular risk and all-cause mortality. Moreover, 
metformin treatment slows the further deterioration of renal function and provides additional 
significant micro-and macrovascular benefits in this patient population.  
The most common side-effects observed in association with metformin use in diabetic individuals are 
mild to moderate gastrointestinal events including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and 
decreased appetite. Apart from lactic acidosis, the overall safety profile of metformin in patients with 
moderate renal impairment is similar to the safety profile in patients with normal renal function. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/539626/2016  
Page 26/29 
 
 
 
 
 
The risk of lactic acidosis is very rare in clinical practice and in the majority of cases only observed in 
emergency care. In addition, although causality cannot be ruled out, other factors rather than 
metformin are most likely the causes of lactic acidosis. 
Overall, metformin has been used safely in patients with moderate renal impairment at reduced doses 
without causing significant metformin or lactate plasma elevations. Moreover, recent clinical guidelines 
in the treatment of T2DM recommend the use of metformin in moderate renal impairment. As there is 
a clear relationship between renal function and metformin exposure, a recommendation for a daily 
dose of 2000 mg/day and 1000 mg/day dose in patients with moderate renal impairment stages 3a 
and 3b, respectively, can be concluded from the data provided. 
In conclusion, the possible elevated risk of lactic acidosis could be sufficiently minimised in patients 
with moderate renal impairment (GFR greater than 30 ml/min) with a clear dosing recommendation, 
additional monitoring of GFR levels before and during treatment, and updated warnings and 
precautions in the SmPC and package leaflet. In addition, routine risk minimisation will be extended to 
include cumulative review of lactic acidosis in the PSURs and a targeted questionnaire. 
Based on the review of all available data on safety and efficacy, the benefit-risk balance of medicinal 
products containing metformin remains favourable and it is recommended that the marketing 
authorisations are varied regarding the use in renal impairment. 
4.  Risk management 
The MAHs should update their risk management system described in a Risk Management Plan which 
shall be submitted to the National Competent Authorities for assessment within 3 months following 
adoption of the CHMP Opinion.  
4.1.  Pharmacovigilance plan  
The following routine pharmacovigilance activity is to be implemented by all MAHs of products 
containing metformin: 
•  A targeted questionnaire should be implemented in order to request and obtain from the 
reporter all relevant follow-up information including medical data available regarding the 
condition lactic acidosis for each individual case safety report. These questionnaires will enable 
the MAH to further document the cases reported and recorded in the MAH’s database with 
regards of the lactic acidosis risk. These cases will be subject to the routine signal detection 
performed by the MAH on the cases received. 
The following points should be included in the questionnaire: 
o  metabolic acidosis: lactate level, blood pH (arterial our venous), anion gap, ketonuria 
and β-hydroxybutyrate 
o  metformin: daily dose; date/time/value of last dose, plasma level, concentration in 
erythrocytes 
o 
o 
renal function: known values before and during the event. 
risk factors: alcohol use, exposure to contrast media, infection/sepsis, renal disease, 
dehydration, diarrhoea, vomiting, acute heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, 
other conditions with hypoxia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/539626/2016  
Page 27/29 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the following routine pharmacovigilance activity is to be implemented by the MAHs of 
products subject to the requirements to provide PSURs as per EURD List: 
•  A cumulative analysis of the events of the SMQ lactic acidosis including the information 
collected through the questionnaires should be provided within the next PSURs of the products, 
with a special focus on CKD stage 3. 
4.2.   Risk Minimisation activities 
4.2.1.  Amendments to the product information 
The CHMP considered that amendments to sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 of the SmPC were necessary to 
include the information of this review. 
The use of metformin containing medicinal products was extended to patients with moderate renal 
impairment (GFR 30 to 59 ml/min), with the exception of the fixed-dose combination 
dapagliflozin/metformin, which is still not recommended this patient population. In addition the fixed-
dose combinations canagliflozin/metformin and empagliflozin/metformin are not recommended in 
patients with GFR<45 ml/min. 
Moreover these products should be used at a lower dose in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
The CHMP however considered that metformin containing products should keep the contraindication in 
patients with severe renal impairment. 
Further warnings and precautions of use related to the risk of lactic acidosis associated with the use of 
metformin containing products were also included and other important information harmonised. 
The Package Leaflet was amended accordingly. 
5.  Grounds for Opinion 
Whereas, 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The CHMP considered the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC for metformin 
containing medicinal products. 
The CHMP reviewed the totality of the data submitted by the MAHs on the safety and efficacy 
of metformin containing medicinal products for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus in 
subjects with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min) with a focus on the risk of lactic 
acidosis. 
The CHMP considered that there is evidence from clinical and epidemiological studies indicating 
the benefits of the use of metformin containing medicinal products in patients with moderate 
renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min). 
The CHMP considered the evidence from epidemiological studies, which have shown that lactic 
acidosis is a very rare condition that occurs most often in patients with acute renal or 
cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Recent scientific data have concluded that the main causes 
of lactic acidosis are cardiogenic or hypovolemic shock, severe heart failure, severe trauma, 
and sepsis; therefore lactic acidosis is not primarily caused by metformin treatment. 
Assessment report

• 
• 
The CHMP considered that publications in the medical literature have shown that metformin at 
reduced dose may be safely used in patients with moderate renal impairment. In addition, 
published epidemiological studies indicate that metformin is often used in clinical practice in 
patients with moderate renal impairment as reflected in current clinical guidelines without a 
marked increase in risk of lactic acidosis or other serious side effects. 
The CHMP was of the view that the risk of lactic acidosis can be minimised in patients with 
moderate renal impairment with clear dosing recommendations, additional monitoring of GFR 
levels before and during treatment and updated warnings and precautions in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL). In addition, routine 
pharmacovigilance activities will be extended to include a cumulative review and a targeted 
follow up questionnaire on lactic acidosis cases to be submitted in subsequent PSURs. 
In view of the above, the Committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of metformin containing 
medicinal products remains favourable taking into account the agreed amendments to the product 
information.  
The Committee, as a consequence, recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisations for metformin containing medicinal products.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update information and amend the frequencies 
of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based on the final results from study CSL654_3003 listed as a category 
3 study in the RMP; this is an open-label, multicentre, uncontrolled study to evaluate the safety, pharma-
cokinetics and clinical response of rIX-FP with regard to the prevention and treatment of bleeding in previ-
ously untreated patients (PUPs) with Haemophilia B. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The RMP version 4.1 has also been submitted (response to 2nd RSI). 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and update the list 
of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The  requested  variation  proposed  amendments  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
This application relates to paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the paediatric Regulation.

2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Arm 4 of study CSL654_3003 was conducted to obtain safety and efficacy information for the use of rIX-FP 
in PUPs with severe hemophilia B and to collect information on inhibitor formation in PUPs 0 to < 18 years 
of age. The study was prematurely stopped, and 12 PUPs were actually treated with rIX-FP. 
Pharmacokinetic evaluation comprises 8 data-sets with 3 sampling time-points for obtaining Incremental 
Recovery (IR) and cmax. Residual FIX-levels of previous treatments impair the value of the results. In the 
age-group 0-6 years (n=7), median IR was 1.2 ([IU/dL]/[IU/kg]), cmax was about 63IU/dL, and trough 
levels after 7 days were 11.85 IU/dL with wide ranges. Lower bound of trough levels was 2.7 IU/dL. 
The only patient within the older paediatric age group (11 years) had significantly lower IR and cmax values, 
and did not reach measurable steady-state results (below level of quantification). This patient developed 
high-titre inhibitor with hypersensitivity. 
Efficacy evaluation was based upon Annualized Bleeding Rates (ABRs), consumption of FIX, and treatment 
response. Presentation of respective results require further amendments. 
One subject entered the surgery sub-study for port insertion. Two additional subjects underwent surgical 
procedures. 
Adverse Event profile in general seems to be in accordance with the age-group. A high number of 9 hyper-
sensitivities, 4 rashes and 2 urticarias in this narrow patient group were subject to further discussion. One 
11 year old subject suffered from high-titre inhibitor with hypersensitivity.  
Overall, results of the study have been amended according to the clinical guideline. Product information 
and Clinical Overview have been amended, accordingly. 
The updated RMP version 4.1 can be considered acceptable (see section 15). 
The benefit-risk balance of IDELVION remains positive.

ation 
5.  Introduction 
Regulatory aspects: 
The MAH submitted the Clinical Study Report of CSL654_3003 PUP with respective SmPC and RMP updates. 
With  the  submission  of  this  variation,  the  MAH  considers  that  the  required  additional  pharmacovigilance 
activity CSL654_3003 Clinical study (category 3 study in Table Part III.3-1) has been completed and re-
quests this MEA to be considered fulfilled. 
With the completion of CSL654-3003 – PUP CSR, the MAH has finalized all studies agreed in the paediatric 
investigation plan 001107-PIP01-10-M04. A compliance check has been performed. 
Publication of the outcome of the current procedure should follow Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation. 
Clinical aspects: 
Study CSL654_3003 was conducted to obtain safety and efficacy information for the use of rIX-FP in PTPs 
and PUPs (Arm 4) with severe hemophilia B and to collect information on inhibitor formation in PUPs 0 to 
<  18  years  of  age.  At  least  20  PUPs  were  planned  to  be  enrolled  in  the  study  initially,  in  line  with  the 
respective Clinical Guideline [2011]. After the PUP study started, the guideline was updated, and PUP stud-
ies  were  no  longer  required  [2018].  Subsequently,  the  MAH  stopped  enrollment  in  accordance  with  the 
PDCO (EMEA-001107-PIP01-10-M04). 12 PUPs were actually treated with rIX-FP. 
Study 3003 was completed (last patient visit) in June 2021 for PUPs (Arm 4). 
6.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
FIX activity after a single dose of 50 international units (IU)/kg rIX-FP was analyzed using non-compart-
mental pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis. Maximum concentration (Cmax) and incremental recovery (IR) were 
presented. Because of considerable residual levels of previous product evident at predose (eg, due to prior 
rIX-FP dosing), calculations of baseline-corrected PK parameters (by subtraction of the predose FIX activity 
level from subsequent postdose levels) were limited to IR and maximum concentration (Cmax). In addition, 
observed trough and steady-state FIX activity during the efficacy period were recorded. 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted (CSR and Clinical Overview) 
PK assessment of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP with selected time points, or IR, was in general done at the beginning of 
the  study.  Blood  sampling  for  measurement  of  plasma  FIX  activity  (central  laboratory)  was  done  before 
infusion of rIX-FP, at 30 ± 5 minutes, at 72 ± 24 hours (ie, 3 ± 1 day), and at 168 ± 24 hours (ie, 7 ± 1 
days). Eight PUPs had sufficient FIX activity measurements to allow for non-compartmental estimation of 
IR and Cmax.

6.2.  Results (CSR and Clinical Overview) 
Median Incremental Recovery (IR) was 1.2 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) with a range of 0.9 to 1.9 for 7 children <6yrs 
and 0.8 for one child of 11 years. Median baseline-corrected Cmax was 62.6 IU/dL for 7 children < 6yrs 
with a range of 45.2 to 83.8 and 39.9 mIU/dL for 1 child of 11 yrs:

Trough FIX activity levels were a defined as a subset of the collected FIX activity samples that were col-
lected at a scheduled visit, measured at the central lab, but were not part of a PK collection or surgery 
sub-studies.

Steady-state FIX activity levels were a defined as a subset of the trough FIX activity levels that were col-
lected before a 3rd consecutive dose in the 14- or 10-day / 3 x per month prophylaxis regimens, or be-
fore a 4th consecutive dose on the 7-day prophylaxis regimen. 
6.3.  Discussion (Rapporteur) 
Database  of  8  data-sets  with  only  3  sampling  time-points  for  PK-data  is  considered  to  be  narrow,  and 
residual  FIX-levels  of  previous  treatments  impair  the  value  of  the  results.  Median  and  range  have  been 
extracted by the Rapporteur as presented above. These are considered to be more adequate than mean-
values for clinical purposes in such narrow data-base. The Clinical Overview Addendum should be updated, 
accordingly (Q). 
PK-results:  
Age-group 0-6 years (n=7): Incremental Recovery of 1.2 ([IU/dL]/[IU/kg]), Cmax of about 63IU/dL, and 
trough levels after 7 days of 11.85 IU/dL are noted. The documented wide ranges are not unusual for the 
age-group. Of note, the lower bound of trough levels is 2.7 IU/dL, which is considered to be low but “pro-
tective” in the common understanding of activity levels. 
Age group >6 years (n=1: 11 years): The only patient within the older paediatric age group (11 years) had 
untypical significantly lower IR and Cmax values, and did not reach measurable steady-state results (below 
level of quantification). These conflicting results have not been further commented. Further, table 11-8 of 
the  CSR  is  misleading,  as  the  “Total”  column  contains  data  of  the  lower  paediatric  age  group,  only.  For 
interpretation  of  these  results  with  respect  to  the  11  y/o  subject,  clinical/timely  context  of  the  PK-  and 
trough-level-evaluations should be analysed with his inhibitor- with hypersensitivity-development (Q). 
The number of patients with true severe Haemophilia B (<1% FIX activity) and – if appropriate, subgroup 
PK-analysis of only these data-sets should be amended for further discussion and reflection in the clinical 
Overview. (Q) 
7.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted (CSR and Clinical Overview) 
Demography: 
14 male PUPs were enrolled in Arm 4, and 12 PUPs were treated with rIX-FP with at least 1 dose. At the 
time  of  enrolment,  most  PUPs  (N = 11)  were  < 6 years  of  age,  with  a  mean  (range)  age  of 
0.4 (0 to 1) years. The only PUP ≥ 6 years of age was 11 years old and the only patient of Asian ethnicity. 
Ten PUPs (71.4%) completed the study who did not receive rIX-FP during the study. Four PUPs (28.6%) 
discontinued from the study for the following reasons: 
2 due to withdrawal by subject 
1 before receiving study treatment

Subject Disposition Flowchart (PUPs, Arm 4) 
Figure 10-1 CSR 
Treatment: 
5 subjects had an on-demand treatment period with rIX-FP before routine prophylaxis, and 7 subjects had 
routine prophylaxis immediately without a prior on-demand period. All 12 subjects received rIX-FP as rou-
tine prophylaxis on a 7-day regimen (N = 11) or 10-day regimen (N = 1). Following the development of an 
FIX inhibitor in 1 PUP, he was treated on an intensified treatment with rIX-FP. 
Dosage  for  on-demand  treatment  was  35-75  IU/kg,  Prophylaxis  dose  was  25-50  IU/kg  for  the  7-days 
scheme.

In  the  11  PUPs  of  Study  3003  on  the  7-day  prophylaxis  regimen,  total  annualized  bleeding  rate  (ABR) 
ranged from 0 to 3.89. Five of the 11 PUPs had an ABR of 0 and 8 PUPs had an annualized spontaneous 
bleeding rate (AsBR) of 0. 
23 joint bleeding episodes were reported in 6 PUPs: 13  episodes were reported in the 11-year-old subject 
with target joints while on intensified treatment after inhibitor development; 4 joint bleeding episodes were 
reported  in  1 PUP  during  7-day  prophylaxis;  for  the  remaining  4 PUPs,  ≤ 2 joint  bleeding  episodes  were 
reported.  
Treatment response: 
No major bleeding episodes were reported in any PUP during the study. There were a total of 44 non-major 
bleeding episodes in the 12 PUPs in Study 3003. Of those, 37 bleeding episodes were treated with rIX-FP. 
Of the 37 treated bleeding episodes, 16 were spontaneous, 17 traumatic, and 4 of unknown cause. Across 
the  prophylaxis,  on  demand,  and  intensified  treatment  periods.  93.8%  of  spontaneous  bleeding  events 
were successfully controlled with 1 or 2 rIX-FP infusions.

7.3.  Discussion (Rapporteur) 
One 11-year-old subject (age group 6-12 years) was included. In patients with severe haemophilia it is not 
plausible  that  no  factor-replacement  has  been  administered  up  to  this  age.  Clinical  details  beyond  the 
provided  case-narrative  regarding  history,  and  haemophilia-type  and  -severity  of  this  patient  should  be 
amended for better understanding. (Q) Of note, this patient developed high-titre inhibitor with hypersensi-
tivity, and was the only patient with Asian ethnicity. 
Annualized Bleeding Rates (ABRs): Treatment periods of at least 6 months are requested for calculating 
ABRs in subjects on prophylaxis due to individual and seasonal confounding factors. Further, only total ABR 
is of relevance as “spontaneous” bleed is no standardized term. Total ABRs for all subjects beyond 6 months 
of prophylaxis, and individual ABR together with individual treatment duration might give further insight in 
bleeding pattern of the individual patients. (Q) 
Consumption: Consumption is understood as an efficacy parameter and should be presented in line with 
the  current  clinical  guideline  (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009  rev.  2  Corr). For  prophylaxis,  dose  per  kg 
per month and year for patients on prophylaxis >6 months, and for on-demand treatment the dose per kg 
per event (bleeding episode) - and not per infusion - should be available. For on-demand treatments, the 
dose per kg per bleeding event should be available at least for all bleeds (total), spontaneous, and traumatic 
bleeds. Data should be presented as median and range. (Q)  
Treatment response: Treatment success for 16 spontaneous bleeds was 93.8% with 1 or 2 doses. According 
to the Clinical Guideline, treatment response should be presented as “none”, “moderate”, “good” or “excel-
lent”.  Response  of  all  37  bleeding  episodes  (spontaneous,  traumatic,  and  of  unknown  cause)  should  be 
amended. (Q) 
Surgery: One subject entered the surgery substudy for port insertion for a “surgery period” of 8 days. Total 
consumption per kg and surgical procedure should be available. 
2 additional subjects underwent surgical procedures: 1 underwent (1) port insertion and (2) bilateral ear-
tube-insertion. 1 patient underwent revision of sagittal suture cranio-synostosis. The latter surgery is con-
sidered major. Available data on total consumption for all surgeries should be provided as far as available. 
(Q) 
Overall,  the  presented  efficacy  data  seem  to  correspond  with  similar  replacement  products.  Some  data 
should  be  amended  according  to  the  clinical  guideline.  The  Overview  should  reflect  respective  key  data, 
and relevant results of interest for Idelvion. Due to the narrow data base and the short treatment intervals 
(EDs), summary-numbers might not be representative for the whole PUP-population. 
Surgery-data are expected to be amended.

8.  Clinical Safety aspects 
8.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted (CSR and Clinical Overview) 
Safety was assessed in all PUPs of Study 3003 who received ≥  1 infusion of rIX-FP as  part of either  PK 
evaluation, on-demand treatment, routine prophylaxis, or perioperative management. Safety assessments 
included adverse events (AEs), biochemistry, hematology, local tolerability, vital signs, and physical exam-
inations. Important identified risks associated with rIX-FP therapy include Hypersensitivity / Anaphylactic 
Reactions  and  the  Development  of  Inhibitors  to  FIX.  Important  potential  risks  include  Thromboembolic 
Events and the Development of Antibodies Against Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Host Cell Proteins. 
Safety Population included 5 subjects in Europe, 4 subjects in North America, and 3 subjects in Oceania. 
Primary safety endpoint was the development of inhibitors against FIX. Secondary safety endpoint was the 
occurrence of AEs and related AEs to rIX-FP. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) included PTs associated with the following Standardized MedDRA 
Queries (SMQs) narrow search terms: 1) Anaphylactic Reactions, 2) Hypersensitivity, and 3) Embolic and 
Thrombotic events.

ED = exposure day; max = maximum; min = minimum; NA = not applicable; PUP = previously untreated patient; rIX-
FP = recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with albumin. 
Notes: An ED was defined as any day that the PUP received an rIX-FP infusion, regardless of the number of infusions on 
that day. 
Percentages  were  based  on  the  number  of  PUPs  in  the  Safety  Population  in  each  respective  study  period.  PUPs  who 
participated in multiple periods were counted in each period in which they participated. 
Analysis excludes exposure in the PK and surgery periods. 
One PUP did not receive rIX-FP during the on-demand period; therefore, analysis of EDs was performed for 5 PUPs in 
the on-demand period. 
Source: Table 14.1.4.2.1.99, Table 12-1 CSR 
Overall, 7 of 12 subjects had less than 50, 1 subject between 75 to 100, and 3 subjects above 100 EDs.

Adverse Events:  
Summary: During the on-demand period, 5 of 6 subjects experienced a total of 17 TEAEs. No TEAEs were 
reported during the PK period. During prophylaxis, 11 of 12 subjects experienced a total of 109 TEAEs. One 
11-year-old experienced a TEAE of hypersensitivity leading to withdrawal of rIX-FP (see below). 
5 PUPs (41.7%) had 5 SAEs (Influenza, Device Related Infection, Head Injury, Pneumonia, and Anti Factor 
IX Antibody Increased. Of these, 1 SAE of Anti Factor IX Antibody Increased was assessed as related to 
rIX-FP by the Investigator and was also considered an AESI. 
3 PUPs had 9 AESIs. All of the AESIs were hypersensitivities (including Rash and Urticaria). Four of these 
were assessed to be related: 1 event of Rash in a PUP < 6 years of age and 3 events of Hypersensitivity in 
the 11-year-old PUP who developed the FIX inhibitor. There were no AESIs of anaphylaxis or thromboem-
bolic events. 
Inhibitor development: No subject < 6 years developed an inhibitor to FIX. The only subject > 6 years, an 
11-year-old male, experienced inhibitor development with hypersensitivity reactions and was discontinued 
from the study. 
The respective narrative reads (abbreviated) as follows: 
The child did not test positive for inhibitors to FIX or antibodies to CHO cell proteins. On 17 June 2015 after 
8 EDs of rIX-FP, the subject developed a low-titer inhibitor to FIX On 10 July 2015, the subject experienced 
a mild TEAE of Hypersensitivity during the routine prophylaxis IX-FP infusion, and the infusion was inter-
rupted.  On  31  July  2015,  the  inhibitor  titer  was  measured  to  be  5.61  BU/mL  (high-titer  inhibitor).  The 
subject received a dose of 100 IU/kg rIX-FP on the same day. From March 2016, the subject received a 
once-weekly intensified treatment regimen (100 IU/kg) over approximately the next 2 months but contin-
ued to experience bleeding events in the knee joint. On 11 May 2016, the inhibitor titer was 26.1 IU/kg. 
From 16 May 2016, intensified treatment was switched from once weekly to on-demand, and the inhibitor 
titer  began  to  decrease.  The  subject  further  experienced  bleeding  events,  was  administered  rIX-FP,  and 
experienced 2 related events of Hypersensitivity – one described with symptoms of pallor, fever, respiratory 
rate increased, and abdominal pain - leading to discontinuation from the study drug. At the time of study 
discontinuation, the inhibitor titer of the PUP was 66 BU/mL, and the SAE of Anti Factor IX Antibody In-
creased was not considered resolved. 
Postmarketing experience:  
Overall, the reporting rate for inhibitor development from the postmarketing population remains to be low. 
Up to the Data Lock Point, there have been 5 case reports of inhibitor development to rIX-FP captured in 
the global safety database, which includes evidence of a positive inhibitor test. The case report of inhibitor 
development in the child PUP in Study 3003 has also been captured in the global safety database. Of the 
cumulative 6 reports, 5 cases of inhibitor development were in the pediatric population, and 1 was in an 
adult.

8.3.  Discussion (Rapporteur) 
Exposure: Relevant core parameter with respect to the primary clinical endpoint (development of inhibitors 
against FIX) is the number of Exposure Days (mainly above and below 50 EDs): Seven out of 12 subjects 
had less than 50 EDs. One of those developed an inhibitor after 8 EDs. Five subjects were treated for ≥50 
EDs. 
Adverse Event profile in general seems to be in accordance with the age-group. 
The presentation of clinically relevant events is not considered to be meaningful. At least, the hypersensi-
tivity reactions based on the MedDRA SMQ should be clearly described: 9 “hypersensitivity reactions” in 
this narrow patient group have been described in section 12.3.1 of the CSR; Table 12-3 in the CSR displays 
2  events  of  urticaria,  and  4  events  of  rash;  Table  12-4  presents  3  “hypersensitivities”  within  72  hours; 
Table  12-6  (SMQ  search)  presents  9  “hypersensitivities”,  4  “rashes”,  and  2  “urticarias”.  This  divergent 
information is considered to be not meaningful for assessing this clinically relevant entity of hypersensitiv-
ity-reactions (Q). 
Inhibitor development: One out of 12 subjects suffered high-titer inhibitor development with hypersensi-
tivity.  However,  7  of  these  subjects  had  less  than  50  EDs.  Consequently,  there  was  one  in  6  subjects, 
suffering inhibitor development or reaching ≥ 50EDs. This has to be seen in correlation with a rare inhibitor 
incidence in Hemophilia B, in general (1.5-3%). Further, the presentation of the “hypersensitivities” in this 
only inhibitor patient to be “mild” (section 12.4.3.3, CSR) is misleading – as generalized symptoms with 
stop of infusion were described, and the last event was reason for withdrawal from the study. 
Device related complications: Such events are considered to be “expected events” per definition. However, 
these should be analysed and presented as “significant” AEs in the respective section (CSR 12.4.2), ade-
quately. At least one subject experienced an SAE of “Device Related Infection” (Q). 
Post-marketing experience on inhibitor development is – with the exception of 1 report in the PUP-popula-
tion of study 3003 – not in the scope of this assessment. The number of 6 cumulative inhibitor-reports is 
noted.

9.  Risk management plan 
9.1.  Safety Specification 
Epidemiology of the indications and target population 
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment: 
The section on prevalence of Hemophilia B was updated. Several administrative updates were performed 
on  demographics.  Treatment  options,  natural  history  and  age-related  comorbidities  were  described.  All 
amendments can be considered acceptable.  
Clinical trial exposure 
Study CSL654_3003 was completed. This study was a Study 3003 was a phase 3b open-label, multicenter, 
safety, and efficacy extension study of rIX-FP in subjects with hemophilia B. In total, 12 PUPs completed 
the study. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment: 
The clinical trial exposure was updated with information on study 3003, including addition of exposure in 
PUPs by regimen (table SIII-2). The cumulative clinical trial exposure rIX-FP for all studies added in tables 
by EDs is presented in Table SIII-3a and b, by age in Table SIII-4, by dose in Table SIII-5a and 5b, and by 
ethnic origin in Table SIII-6, respectively. Overall, 126 (only male) patients were treated with rIX-FP. 
The changes in this section of the RMP are acceptable. 
Populations not studied in clinical trials 
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:

rIX-FP,  recombinant  fusion  protein  linking  coagulation  factor  IX  with  albumin;  TEEs,  thromboembolic 
events 
The MAH provided rationale on removal of important potential risks and all of the missing information from 
the list of safety concerns.  
Important potential risks:  
-  Development of Antibodies against CHO Host Cell Proteins- 
Historical reason/ perspective for inclusion: 
Host  cell  proteins  are  a  complex  and  heterogeneous  group  of  impurities  with  substantial  differences  in 
isoelectric point, structure, molecular mass, and hydrophobicity properties. This makes the identification 
and elimination of these proteins difficult [Bailey- Kellogg  et  al,  2014].  
These  process  impurities  are  a  known  risk  for  biological  products  in  general.  Although  the  severity  and 
nature of this risk are currently unknown, the CHO genome contains many proteins that are substantially 
dissimilar to the human genome from the T cell epitope standpoint, and thus inherently pose some risk of 
triggering anti-self-immune response [Bailey-Kellogg et al, 2014]. Patients with a known allergy to hamster 
protein are particularly at risk. 
Reason for proposed removal: 
There are no estimates for development of antibodies to CHO host cell proteins to recombinant FIX products 
or  any  of  its  excipients,  including  hamster  cell  protein  in  the  published  literature  to  date.  There  are  no 
reports  of  antibody  development  to  CHO  host  cell  proteins  received  from  clinical  studies  on  rIX-FP,  and 
there are no reports from post- marketing experience to date.  
This risk of triggering an immune response is already monitored under the medical concept of hypersensi-
tivity anaphylactic reactions and development of inhibitors to factor IX (important identified risks). Addi-
tionally,  information  on  allergy  to  hamster  protein  in  the  product  labeling  (under  contraindications  and 
special warnings and precautions) and routine monitoring of post-marketing data for hypersensitivity/ an-
aphylactic reactions and inhibitor development to FIX are considered sufficient.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/166753/2023 
Page 20/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
Neither in clinical studies including the study assessed in this procedure (study 3003) nor in the PSURs, 
cases of antibodies to CHO host cell proteins have been reported. It is agreed with the MAH that immune 
responses are monitored as well under the identified risks of Hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions and 
Development of inhibitors to FIX. The labelling includes a contraindication in section 4.3 (allergy to hamster 
protein), warning under hypersensitivity in section 4.4 and description of rare development of antibodies 
to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions under section 4.8 of the PI. The risk is considered 
covered in the labelling and is accepted for removal.  
-  Dosing Errors based on variability in assays used during treatment monitoring of factor 
IX levels 
Historical reason/ perspective for inclusion: 
One-stage clotting assay (OSC) is a routinely used assay for potency labeling of factor concentrate vials as 
well as for clinical monitoring of patients. Substantial inter
laboratory variability has been reported for OSCs 
when measuring the activity of factor replacement products due to the wide range of currently available 
activated partial thromboplastin time reagents, calibration standards, factor
deficient plasmas, assay con-
‐
ditions and instruments, and lack of international standardization for OSC assays has been noted across 
‐
FIX products in general [Marlar et al, 2020]. 
These discrepancies between measurements could potentially expose the patients to under-/overdosing. 
Reason for proposed removal: 
There are no reports of medication errors indicating underdosing and overdosing due to assay issues and 
no reports of associated AEs due to assay issues for rIX-FP from post-marketing experience to date. There 
are  no  safety  findings  linked  to  dosing  errors  based  on  variability  in  assays  reported  for  rIX-FP  in  the 
published literature [Ovanesov et al, 2020].  Furthermore, the impact of dosing errors on the individual 
patient due to variability in assays can be considered as low with most specialist coagulation laboratories 
being aware of this situation in general [Ovanesov et al, 2020]. 
The information provided on treatment monitoring with OSCs in the product labeling, together with aware-
ness  of  this  issue  amongst  specialist  coagulation  laboratories  in  the  marketplace  and  continued  routine 
monitoring of medication errors are considered sufficient.  
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
In the last PSUR procedure (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010497/202101) 5 initial cases of medication error were 
reported (2 cases associated with adverse event, 3 cases without adverse event). However, no cases of 
dosing errors based on variability in the assays used during treatment monitoring of FIX levels have been 
reported from the rIX-FP clinical development program or from post-marketing experience. This could be 
due to underreporting. However, section 4.2 includes a detailed section on treatment monitoring, which is 
considered  sufficient.  Removal  of  the  potential  risk  is  accepted.  Medication  errors  should  continue  to  be 
monitored in the PSUR. 
Missing information: 
-  Experience in patients with severe renal and hepatic impairment 
Historical reason/ perspective for inclusion: 
Subjects with hepatic impairment were specifically excluded from clinical trials for rIX-FP if  aspartate ami-
notransferase or alanine transaminase were > 5 times the upper limit of normal.  Therefore, information 
on use of rIX-FP in patients with severe hepatic impairment was considered as missing information.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/166753/2023 
Page 21/55 
 
 
 
 
Subjects with renal impairment were specifically excluded from clinical trials for rIX-FP if serum creatinine 
> 2 times the upper limit of normal at screening. Therefore, information on use of rIX-FP in patients with 
severe renal impairment was considered as missing information.  
Reason for proposed removal: 
rIX-FP is similar to naturally occurring proteins in the human body (ie, FIX and albumin) so no deleterious 
effects are expected in patients with hepatic and renal impairment. Additionally, it is noted in the product 
labeling that rIX-FP is a prescription only medicine which is expected to be used under the supervision of a 
physician experienced in the treatment of hemophilia B. 
Cumulatively, 11 case reports (all pertaining to rIX-FP) were received from post-marketing experience, all 
in patients with medical history of Hepatitis C; Of these, 3 patients additionally reported Hepatitis B, Hepatic 
cirrhosis, and Hepatic fibrosis, respectively. Review of the post-marketing safety data indicates that patients 
with hepatic impairment have been prescribed rIX-FP, with no new safety concerns identified to date specific 
to this special population. 
Cumulatively, 3 case reports (2 pertaining to rIX-FP and 1 to generic FIX) with pre-existing renal condition 
were received from post-marketing experience where CSL Behring assessed that none of these conditions 
were considered as severe renal impairment. 
Overall, the available evidence from post-marketing experience indicates that the safety profile of rIX-FP 
in patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment is not different from the population studied in clinical 
trials and use in the post-marketing setting to date. Hence, no specific safety risk is anticipated in these 
populations and the lack of information alone does not warrant the inclusion as a safety concern. Routine 
monitoring of post-marketing data in these special populations is considered sufficient to gather information 
to  further  characterise  the  nature,  severity,  and  risk  of  adverse  outcomes  associated  with  rIX-FP  use  in 
patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment.  
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
Experience  in  patients  with  severe  renal  and  hepatic  impairment  as  missing  information  is  accepted  for 
removal since cumulative and recent data (last PSUR) indicate that events developing from renal or hepatic 
impairment  are  mostly  related  to  underlying  medical  condition.  Although  these  populations  were  not  in-
cluded in clinical trials, a different safety profile for rIX-FP in patients with renal of hepatic impairment is 
currently  not  expected.  The  MAH  should  include  this  population  for  monitoring  in  the  PSUR  for  further 
evaluation. 
-  Efficacy and Safety in PUPs 
Historical reason/ perspective for inclusion: 
Since the inclusion criteria for the pivotal rIX-FP Clin Dev program required previous FIX treatment, infor-
mation on efficacy and safety in PUPs was considered as missing information for rIX-FP at the time of the 
initial marketing authorization in the EU.  
Reason for proposed removal: 
Study CSL654_3003 that enrolled both PTPs (Arms 1-3) and PUPs (Arm 4) has now been completed. During 
the study, 12 PUPs (all < 6 years of age except 1 subject of 11 years of age) received ≥ 1 dose of rIX FP. 
The efficacy data reported for PUPs was consistent with those previously reported for PTPs and confirmed 
that rIX-FP is effective as routine prophylaxis and as on-demand treatment in pediatric PUPs ≤ 12 years at 
the currently approved dosing regimens.  
One PUP previously treated with blood products prior to enrollment in the study developed an inhibitor to 
FIX. There were no deaths, serious hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, non-neutralizing antibodies to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/166753/2023 
Page 22/55 
 
 
 
 
FIX, TEEs or antibodies to CHO host cell proteins that were reported in the study. One nonserious TEAE of 
Hypersensitivity (associated with the FIX inhibitor) led to discontinuation of study treatment. Overall, no 
safety concerns were identified in PUPs over up to 3 years of rIX-FP treatment.  
Cumulatively,  there  are  no  reports  of  inhibitor  development  in  PUPs  from  post-marketing  experience  to 
date. 
Overall, the safety and efficacy of rIX-FP in PUPs is consistent with the known safety and efficacy profile of 
rIX-FP in adult and pediatric PTPs with hemophilia B reported previously and this is reflected in the updated 
product  labeling.  Routine  monitoring  of  post-marketing  data  along  with  review  of  inhibitor  development 
against FIX as an important identified risk for rIX-FP are considered sufficient to gather additional infor-
mation regarding the use of rIX- FP in PUPs and to further identify any potential adverse outcomes associ-
ated with rIX- FP. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
Efficacy and safety of rIX-FP have been investigated in study 3003 for 12 PUPs. There were no SEAs except 
for development of inhibitor to FIX and consequently hypersensitivity reactions, which are known identified 
risks.  No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified  in  this  population  and  no  other  safety  profile  is  expected. 
Accepted for removal. 
-  Experience in pregnancy and lactation, including labour and delivery 
Historical reason/ perspective for inclusion: 
Hemophilia B is an X-chromosome linked recessive disorder, therefore it is more common in men (87%) 
than in women (5%) and unknown gender (6%) [WFH Global Survey, 2020]. The  clinical studies for rIX-
FP  enrolled  only  males,  as  such  information  regarding  the  use  of  rIX-FP  in  pregnancy  and  lactation  was 
considered as missing information. 
Reason for proposed removal: 
rIX-FP is similar to naturally occurring proteins in the human body (i.e., FIX and albumin) so no effects on 
embryo-toxicity and fertility are expected. Additionally, recommendations are included in the product la-
beling to only use rIX-FP during pregnancy and lactation when clearly indicated and for caution to be exer-
cised during administration to a nursing mother. 
Cumulatively, there was only 1 non-serious pregnancy case report from post-marketing experience where 
a female patient who was a hemophilia B carrier was given rIX-FP before vaginal delivery. The pregnancy 
outcome was normal with no post-delivery complications for both the mother and child. 
There are no literature articles reporting safety concerns of use of FIX products in pregnancy and lactation 
to date. There are no literature articles reporting use of rIX-FP in pregnancy and lactation to date. 
Overall, there is no data to suggest that the safety profile is different in pregnant or breastfeeding females 
and sufficient guidance is provided in the product labeling. Hence, no specific safety risk is anticipated in 
these  populations  and  the  lack  of  information  alone  does  not  warrant  the  inclusion  as  a  safety  concern. 
Routine  monitoring  of  post-marketing  data  together  with  pregnancy  experience,  and  outcome  question-
naires, and information noted in the product labeling are considered sufficient to gather further information 
regarding any potential adverse outcomes associated with use of rIX-FP in pregnancy and lactation.

PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
The MAH has indicated that cumulatively there is only 1 pregnancy case report from post-marketing expe-
rience. A single pregnancy case is not considered  sufficient to characterize experience in pregnancy and 
lactation. The issue should remain in the summary of safety concerns together with the routine pharma-
covigilance activity of a specific follow-up questionnaire to further characterize the risk. 
-  Experience in elderly patients 
Historical reason/ perspective for inclusion: 
Elderly patients (> 65 years of age) were excluded from the clinical trial program for rIX-FP. From the data 
obtained in the worldwide literature to date, there is a paucity of information regarding use of rIX-FP in 
individuals over 65 years of age.  
Reason for proposed removal: 
rIX-FP is similar to naturally occurring proteins in the human body (ie, FIX and albumin) so no deleterious 
effects are expected in this patient population. 
Cumulatively, 14 cases were reported for rIX-FP in the post-marketing experience from patients aged older 
than 65 years of which, 4 patients were aged between 65 to 69 years, 5  patients were aged between 70 
to 79 years, 1 patient was aged between 80 to 89 years, and for 4 patients the age was not reported. The 
most reported AEs were mostly bleeding events (Gingival bleeding/ Haemorrhage/ Haemorrhoidal haem-
orrhage/  Muscle  haemorrhage/  Haemarthrosis)  due  to  the  underlying  condition,  and  the  only  related  AE 
was Drug ineffective (reported in 5 patients). Review of these cases did not identify any safety relevant 
information specific to this age group. 
Overall, the safety data obtained from post-marketing use in elderly patients is in line with the safety profile 
of the product as established in clinical studies and by post-marketing surveillance and there is no indication 
of a specific safety risk in elderly patients. Hence, no specific safety risk is anticipated in this age group and 
the  lack  of  information  alone  does  not  warrant  the  inclusion  as  a  safety  concern.  Routine  monitoring  of 
post-marketing data in this age group is considered sufficient to gather further information regarding any 
potential adverse outcomes associated with rIX-FP use in elderly patients. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
Experience in elderly should remain as missing information in the summary of safety concerns as safety in 
this population is yet not considered adequately characterized. The last PSUR shows that cases of elderly 
are reported but lacked sufficient information for further assessment. Although no safety information could 
be identified, the risk should be further monitored in the PSUR. In addition, this population is part of par-
ticipation in EUHASS to collect long-term safety data (additional pharmacovigilance activity). 
-  Experience in patients for ITI (off-label use) 
Historical reason/ perspective for inclusion: 
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) has been an off-label practice for FIX products to treat inhibitor develop-
ment based on published literature [Klamroth et al, 2019; Roberts et al, 2019; Saini et al, 2019; Ahmad-
Nabi et al, 2018; Malec et al, 2018; Verghese et al, 2013].  The goal of ITI is eradication of inhibitors to 
restore  responsiveness  to  FIX  treatment.  ITI  eliminates  the  anamnestic  response  by  administering  high 
doses of FIX. Treatment regimens utilize ongoing, frequent, uninterrupted exposure to FIX over a period of 
a few months to 2 or more years with the goal of inducing antigen-specific tolerance. Successful ITI leads 
to normalization of the FIX half-life, near normalization of the patient’s quality of life, and a  marked re-
duction in treatment costs over the long term. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/166753/2023 
Page 24/55 
 
 
 
 
ITI was not part of the Clin Dev program for rIX-FP. Information on off-label use for ITI was thus classified 
as missing information with an aim to quantify the extent of off label use and further characterize the risk 
to inform health care professionals about the unknown benefit- risk profile of rFIX-FP in ITI.  
Reason for proposed removal: 
There are no reports of use of rIX-FP for ITI from post-marketing experience to date. There are no literature 
articles reporting use of rIX-FP for ITI to date. There have been literature reports of nephrotic syndrome 
following ITI therapy with other FIX products [Ahmad-Nabi et al, 2018; Malec et al, 2018; Verghese et al, 
2013].  
Overall, there is no evidence of this risk being different to other FIX products. The product labeling advises 
that the safety and efficacy has not been established in ITI therapy and about risk in patients with history 
of allergic reactions. It also specifically advises on nephrotic syndrome following attempts with ITI in pa-
tients with a history of allergic reactions and FIX  inhibitors. Additionally, routine monitoring of post-mar-
keting data for off-label use of ITI therapy and hypersensitivity and inhibitors to factor IX (important iden-
tified risks for IX- FP) is considered sufficient. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
It  is  acknowledged  that  from  post-marketing  experience  no  reports  of  use  of  rIX-FP  for  ITI  have  been 
received. ITI has not been part of the Clin Dev program for rIX-FP and there is currently insufficient evidence 
regarding  this  risk  of  off-label  use.  Nonetheless,  a  different  safety  profile  is  not  expected  and  therefore 
Experience in patients for ITI (off-label use) is accepted to remove as missing information from the sum-
mary of safety concerns. The risk should be followed with routine pharmacovigilance activities and need to 
be monitored through PSURs. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
Overall, the summary of safety concerns should be updated to: 
Important identified risks 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity / anaphylactic reactions 
Development of inhibitors to factor IX 
Important potential risks 
• 
TEEs 
Missing information

9.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine PV activities are in place. In addition, the RMP has specific adverse reaction follow-up question-
naires for important identified risks of Hypersensitivity / anaphylactic reactions and Thromboembolic events 
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
The FU-Q for missing information of Experience in pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes was removed, which 
is not accepted since experience in pregnancy and lactation should remain missing information, for which 
a FU-Q is warranted.  
Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
The  description  on  study  CSL654_3003  was  deleted.  The  other  additional  PhV  activity  remains  in  place, 
i.e.; Hemophilia Network Registry: European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance (EUHASS) - To obtain long-
term safety data (including inhibitor development) and to review the data for safety concerns.

Plans for post-authorization efficacy studies 
The MAH proposed to remove of table IV.1 for study CSL654_3003  
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
Removal  of  study  CSL654_3003  from  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  can  be  accepted  since  the 
study has been finalized. The summary table (III.3-1) is in line with the pharmacovigilance plan. However, 
the additional pharmacovigilance activities should include safety concerns addressed “Usage and safety in 
the  elderly  (≥  65  years)”  as  was  stated  in  RMP  version  3.4.  Overall,  this  section  should  be  updated  in 
accordance with the summary of safety concerns. 
9.3.  Risk minimization measures 
PRAC Rapporteur assessor’s comment:  
Table Part V.1-1 and V.3-1 were aligned with removal of the safety concerns. This section should be updated 
in accordance with the summary of safety concerns.

9.4.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 With the responses to 2nd Request for Supplementary information the MAH submitted an updated RMP 
(version 4.1) which is considered acceptable. 
10.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated based on the final results 
from study CSL654_3003 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. The package Leaflet has been amended, 
accordingly.

11.  Request for supplementary information 
11.1.  Major objections 
None. 
11.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
General: 
1.  The MAH is asked to submit the final PIP Compliance Report. 
2.  The MAH is asked to verify the number of patients with severe Haemophilia B (<1% FIX activity) and 
provide respective patient-related data. 
3.  One 11-year-old subject was included. In patients with severe haemophilia it is not plausible that no 
factor-replacement has been administered up to this age. Clinical details beyond the provided case-
narrative regarding history, and haemophilia-type and -severity of this patient should be amended for 
better understanding. Of note, this patient developed high-titre inhibitor with hypersensitivity, and was 
the only patient with Asian ethnicity. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
4.  The only patient within the older paediatric age group (11 years) had untypical significantly lower IR 
and cmax values, and did not reach measurable steady-state results. These conflicting PK- and zero-
trough-level-results results should be discussed with respect to the clinical/timely context of the eval-
uation with inhibitor-development in this patient. 
5.  The number of patients with true severe Haemophilia B (<1% FIX activity) and – if appropriate, sub-
group PK-analysis of only these data-sets should be amended for further discussion and reflection in 
the Clinical Overview. 
6.  Time on study: Min and Max values of the “Total” patient collective in the last column of Table 10-3, 
CSR, cannot be traced from the values of the reference columns. The MAH is asked to explain. 
Efficacy: 
7.  Total Annualized Bleeding Rates (ABRs) for all subjects having received >6 months of prophylaxis, and 
individual ABR together with individual treatment duration are requested. 
8.  According to the Clinical Guideline, consumption should be presented for prophylaxis as dose per kg 
per month and year for patients on prophylaxis for >6 months, and for on-demand treatment as dose 
per kg per event (bleeding episode). For on-demand treatments, the dose per kg per bleeding event 
should be available at least for all bleeds (total), spontaneous, and traumatic bleeds. Data should be 
presented as median and range. 
9.  According to the Clinical Guideline, treatment response should be presented as “none”, “moderate”, 
“good” or “excellent”. Treatment response of all 37 bleeding episodes (spontaneous, traumatic, and of 
unknown cause) should be amended that way. 
Surgery: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/166753/2023 
Page 28/55 
 
 
 
 
10.  One  subject  entered  the  surgery  substudy  for  port  insertion  for  a  “surgery  period”  of  8  days.  Total 
consumption per kg and surgical procedure, and additional information is requested, according to the 
Clinical Guideline.  
2 additional subjects underwent surgical procedures: 1 underwent (1) port insertion and (2) bilateral 
ear-tube-insertion. 1 patient underwent revision of sagittal suture craniosynostosis. The latter surgery 
is considered major. Data on total consumption per kg and surgical procedure is requested for both 
additional subjects, as far as available. 
Safety: 
11.  Presentation of all potential hypersensitivity reactions in the CSR is divergent: Section 12.3.1 describes 
9 “hypersensitivity reactions; Table 12-3 displays 2 events of urticaria, and 4 events of rash; Table 
12-4 displays 3 “hypersensitivities” within 72 hours; Table 12-6 (SMQ search) displays 9 “hypersensi-
tivities”,  4  “rashes”,  and  2  “urticarias”.  Brief  and  meaningful  presentation  of  this  clinically  relevant 
entity of events is requested. 
12.  At least one subject experienced an SAE of “Device Related Infection”. All device related complications 
(including non-serious) should be presented, irrespective of causal relation. 
Clinical Overview: 
13.  Clinical Overview should be updated according to the assessment for presenting meaningful data. PK-
results should be presented as median and range. Key efficacy and safety data should be amended 
according to the assessment. Presentation of inhibitor development should rely on those (6) subjects 
with ≥50 EDs. Further, other significant events including hypersensitivities and device-related compli-
cations should be addressed, adequately. 
SmPC: 
14.  Substantial abbreviation of the proposed SmPC-amendments is  requested, according to the assess-
ment and to the comments made in the attached product information (please, refer to Attachment 1). 
RMP aspects 
15.  The MAH should update the summary of safety concerns to: 
Important identified risks 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity / anaphylactic reactions 
Development of inhibitors to factor IX 
Important potential risks 
• 
TEEs 
Missing information 
• 
• 
Experience in pregnancy and lactation, including labour and delivery 
Experience in elderly patients 
16.  The MAH should include “patients with severe renal and hepatic impairment”, “medication errors” and 
“Experience in patients for ITI (off-label use)” for monitoring in the PSUR for further evaluation. 
17.  The FU-Q for missing information of Experience in pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes should remain 
as routine pharmacovigilance activity. 
18.  The elderly population (>65 years) should remain part of participation in EUHASS to collect long-term 
safety data (additional pharmacovigilance activity).

tary information 
12.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
General: 
Question 1 
The MAH is asked to submit the final PIP Compliance Report. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The final PIP Compliance Report (C-001107-PIP-01-10-M04) has been provided in Module 1.10 with this 
response to the request for supplementary information. 
Assessment and Conclusion: Point is solved 
Question 2 
The  MAH  is  asked  to  verify  the  number  of  patients  with  severe  Haemophilia  B  (<1%  FIX  activity)  and 
provide respective patient-related data. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In response to the rapporteur’s request, CSLB first evaluated all central laboratory values before PK dosing. 
For those central laboratory values ≥ 1%, all available FIX activity data (local laboratory) including case 
report forms (CRFs) were checked. In case of missing values, CSLB also followed up with Principal Investi-
gators to confirm hemophilia B severity. Across these sources of information (summarized in Table 1), CSLB 
confirms that all 12 treated PUPs in Study CSL654_3003 have severe hemophilia B (< 1% FIX activity).

Question 3 
One 11-year-old subject was included. In patients with severe haemophilia it is not plausible that no factor-
replacement  has  been  administered  up  to  this  age.  Clinical  details  beyond  the  provided  case-narrative 
regarding history, and haemophilia-type and -severity of this patient should be amended for better under-
standing. Of note, this patient developed high-titre inhibitor with hypersensitivity, and was the only patient 
with Asian ethnicity. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
CSLB has contacted the principal investigator (PI) of the investigational site and asked for additional infor-
mation on the medical history of the patient. The medical records of the patient did not contain any new 
information besides the provided information in the narrative (CSL654_3003 PUP CSR Section 14.3.3.2). 
The PI decided to contact both patient and his parents and asked for additional information. 
On 26 October 2011 and 30 October 2011 the subject had received transfusions with packed red blood cells 
(1 administration on each day) for the treatment of anemia associated with a violaceous scrotal swelling 3 
to  4  days  after  circumcision.  He  was  also  treated  with  tranexamic  acid  at  that  time.  After  a  week,  the 
swelling subsided. The subject had a negative family history of bleeding disorders. At that time the family 
physician had suspicion raised for a non-specific bleeding disorder. He advised for a referral to a pediatric 
hematologist  but  the  parents  decided  not  to  consult  a  hematologist  until  2013.  Severe  hemophilia  B  (< 
1%) was diagnosed on 9 July 2013 after a factor assay was requested by a referred hematologist. After 
diagnosis of hemophilia B the parents only noticed isolated ecchymosis in trauma-induced areas. Parents 
recalled that he had these events before the diagnosis and attributed these to the high activity status of 
the child. Spontaneous resolution of ecchymosis were noticed and no factor replacement was given of either 
plasma products or factor concentrates. No further medical history or prior medications related to hemo-
philia or other treatments prior to study enrollment were reported other than that of circumcision. In 2015 
he was referred to the investigational site, enrolled into the study and treated with rIX-FP as described in 
the patient’s narrative (CSL654_3003 PUP CSR Section 14.3.3.2). 
The PI further remarked that comprehensive hemophilia care is relatively new in the Philippines. The diag-
nosis  is  usually  late  and  most  just  presumptive  through  medical  history  of  hemophilia  in  the  family  or 
maternal  male  relatives.  Factor  assays  are  not  widely  available  in  every  region  in  the  country  and  are 
expensive. Hemophilia Factor IX concentrates are not commercially available in the Philippines. Sometimes 
they are donated from international hemophilia organizations. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Additional information regarding the patient’s history, and the medicinal background have been provided. 
This amendment further enlightens the specific circumstances, explaining why a patient with severe Hae-
mophilia B (<1% FIX activity) has been treated with a factor concentrate the first time in his life at the age 
of 11. The circumstances of medical care, clearly deviating from Western European Countries may serve as 
an acceptable explanation for the unusual history. 
Conclusion: Point is solved

Pharmacokinetics: 
Question 4 
The only patient within the older paediatric age group (11 years) had untypical significantly lower IR and 
Cmax values, and did not reach measurable steady-state results. These conflicting PK- and zero-trough-
level-results results should be discussed with respect to the clinical/timely context of the evaluation with 
inhibitor-development in this patient. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
One patient had baseline-corrected IR and Cmax values of 0.8 [IU/dL]/[IU/kg] and 39.9 IU/dL, respectively. 
These values are slightly lower than the minimum values in the < 6 years age group (0.9 [IU/dL]/[IU/kg] 
and 45.2 IU/dL, respectively). For comparison, as shown in Section 5.2 of the IDELVION SmPC, the mini-
mum  values  of  IR  and  Cmax  in  previously  treated  patients  (PTPs)  6  to  <  12  years  of  age  were  0.7 
[IU/dL]/[IU/kg] and 34.9 IU/dL, respectively. Therefore, while this PUP had the lowest IR and Cmax values 
in the PUP arm, these values are within the same ranges as those in the same age group in previous studies. 
Additionally, the lack of steady-state results for this PUP is not due to values below the level of quantifica-
tion,  but  because  this  PUP  did  not  have  any  FIX  activity  samples  that  met  the  trough  or  steady-state 
requirements. As all of his PK samples were collected at unscheduled visits (except for 1 which was collected 
5 days after rIX-FP administration), none could be classified as trough or steady-state levels. 
The timeline of FIX activity and inhibitor assessments for this PUP up to and including inhibitor detection is 
summarized in Table 2. The complete data for inhibitor titer over time are available in CSL654_3003 PUP 
CSR Listing 16.2.8.1.4.1.99. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Further details have been provided regarding the child who presented exceptional patient’s characteristics 
and laboratory results. Presented data are considered to be plausible. 
Conclusion: Point is solved.

Question 5 
The number of patients with true severe Haemophilia B (<1% FIX activity) and – if appropriate, subgroup 
PK-analysis of only these data-sets should be amended for further discussion and reflection in the Clinical 
Overview. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Severe hemophilia B has been confirmed for all 12 PUPs (see Response to Question 2). Thus, additional 
subgroup analyses (requested by the reviewer in Question 5) are not necessary, and the Clinical Overview 
was not amended with an additional subgroup analysis. 
Assessment and Conclusion: Point is solved 
Question 6 
Time on study: Min and Max values of the “Total” patient collective in the last column of Table 10-3, CSR, 
cannot be traced from the values of the reference columns. The MAH is asked to explain. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In-text Table 10-3 of the CSR for time on study is provided for reference; the Min and Max values in the 
last column (“Total” study duration) are highlighted: 
CSLB was asked to explain why the Min and Max values in the last column (“Total”) representing all subjects 
and all time periods are not reflected in the columns by study period or treatment regimen. For example, 
the minimum time on study is given as 4.5 months in the “Total” column, while the minimum time on study 
is shown as 1.9 months in the On-demand Period and 3.1 months during the 7-day prophylaxis regimen; 
both values in the study period columns are lower than in the “Total” column. 
The  reason  is  that  values  in  the  “Total”  column  are  derived  subject-level  data  and  are  the  sum  of  the 
durations across all regimen periods for each subject. As seen in Listing 1, for example: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/166753/2023 
Page 34/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  One subject (marked in bold) had a study duration of 1.9 months in the On- demand Period and 
31.1 months on the 7-day regimen. Although 1.9 months is the minimum value for the On-demand 
Period  of  all  subjects  who  had  an  On-demand  Period,  it  does  not  appear  in  the  “Total”  study 
duration column, because total duration for this subject was approximately 33 months (ie, On-
demand + 7-day regimen). 
•  The minimum value in the “Total” column (4.5 months) comes from one subject (italics). In con-
trast,  the  minimum  value  in  the  “7-day  regimen”  column  SR  Table  10-3  is  due  to  one  subject 
(italics). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Meaning of the “Total” column for respective time-periods of treatment has been explained by the MAH to 
be subject-level data and the sum of the durations across all regimen periods for each subject. This expla-
nation is taken. 
Conclusion: Point is solved 
Efficacy: 
Question 7 
Total  Annualized  Bleeding  Rates  (ABRs)  for  all  subjects  having  received  >6  months  of  prophylaxis,  and 
individual ABR together with individual treatment duration are requested. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Ten of the 12 PUPs received > 6 months of prophylaxis with rIX-FP. On the 7-day regimen (N = 9), median 
ABR was 0 (0 to 1.5) for treated bleeding episodes and 1.16 (0 to 3.1) for all bleeding episodes. Data are 
provided  in  Table  3  (individual  ABRs  and  treatment  durations)  and  Table  4  (ABR  summary  statistics  for 
treated and all bleeding episodes).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH presented data on ABRs in patients on treatment for more than 6 months as requested by the 
Clinical Guideline. Further, a differentiation between “treated” bleeds and “all” bleeds has been evaluated. 
The context according to the assessment was the presentation of “spontaneous” bleeds with a rate of zero 
– “spontaneous” bleeds being no standardized and relevant term. However, the now presented data are 
considered to adequately describe the efficacy in the treated patient population. 
Conclusion: Point is solved 
Question 8 
According to the Clinical Guideline, consumption should be presented for prophylaxis as dose per kg per 
month and year for patients on prophylaxis for >6 months, and for on-demand treatment as dose per kg 
per event (bleeding episode). For on-demand treatments, the dose per kg per bleeding event should be 
available at least for all bleeds (total), spontaneous, and traumatic bleeds. Data should be presented as 
median and range. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The requested data are provided in Table 5 (prophylaxis) and Table 6 (on-demand). Section 2.5.4.2.1.2 of 
the Clinical Overview has been amended accordingly. 
Assessment report

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH submitted the requested evaluations on efficacy. 
Yearly consumption for prophylaxis was about 2900 IU/kg with wide interindividual variability based upon 
only 10 individuals. Distinction for 7-days- or 10-days- regimens is not possible due to the low numbers of 
9 and 1 individuals, respectively. Overall, the consumption is within the frame of similar replacement prod-
ucts. 
Dose per bleeding episode in on-demand patients has been presented for all bleeding episodes, spontane-
ous, traumatic and “unknown” bleeds. Overall, doses are considered to represent plausible values, although 
evaluation is again challenged by low numbers, overall. 
Conclusion: Point is solved

Question 9 
According to the Clinical Guideline, treatment response should be presented as “none”, “moderate”, “good” 
or “excellent”. Treatment response of all 37 bleeding episodes (spontaneous, traumatic, and of unknown 
cause) should be amended that way. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
There were no major bleeding episodes in PUPs. 
Treatment response data are available for 13 of the 37 nonmajor bleeding episodes (see summary in Table 
7). The investigators assessed treatment response as “excellent” or “good” for all these 13 minor bleeding 
episodes. The missing data can be ascribed to the fact that treatment response was not consistently as-
sessed and / or recorded, because bleeding episodes were minor, most were treated at home during the 
prophylaxis period, and PUPs / caregivers did not need to visit the study site at the time of the bleeding 
episode. Section 2.5.4.2.2 of the Clinical Overview has been amended accordingly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/166753/2023 
Page 39/55 
 
 
 
 
 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH presented evaluation-data for non-major bleeding episodes as no major bleeds have been rec-
orded, overall. All evaluated bleeding episodes (13 of 37) were rated as excellent or good. No rating for 
non-major bleeds was mandatory – thus missing data are explained, satisfactorily. 
Conclusion: Point is solved 
Surgery: 
Question 10 
One subject entered the surgery substudy for port insertion for a “surgery period” of 8 days. Total con-
sumption per kg and surgical procedure, and additional information is requested, according to the Clinical 
Guideline.  
2 additional subjects underwent surgical procedures: 1 underwent (1) port insertion and (2) bilateral ear-
tube-insertion. One underwent revision of sagittal suture craniosynostosis. The latter surgery is considered 
major. Data on total consumption per kg and surgical procedure is requested for both additional subjects, 
as far as available. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The total consumption for port insertion of Subject who participated in the surgical substudy, was 252 IU/kg 
administered  in  4  doses  during  the  surgical  period  of  8  days.  The  estimated  blood  loss  indicated  by  the 
investigator before surgery and the actual blood loss during surgical drainage was 5 mL. No transfusion of 
blood products was reported during the surgical period. No further information was reported by the inves-
tigator. 
Both Subjects did not participate in the surgical substudy. Subject 0360015-3014 was administered 197.6 
IU/kg in 3 doses for port insertion and 147 IU/kg in 2 doses for grommet insertion. Subject was adminis-
tered > 489.9 IU/kg in 12 doses (amount of 1 dose missing) for sagittal suture craniosynostosis. All avail-
able information is listed in amended Listing 10. No transfusions of blood products were reported during 
the surgical periods. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH submitted additional data on all surgical procedures. Dosages and overall consumption are con-
sidered to be plausible, and no transfusions of blood products have been recorded. 
Conclusion: Point is solved

Safety: 
Question 11 
Presentation of all potential hypersensitivity reactions in the CSR is divergent: Section 12.3.1 describes 9 
“hypersensitivity  reactions”;  Table  12-3  displays  2  events  of  urticaria,  and  4  events  of  rash;  Table  12-4 
displays 3 “hypersensitivities” within 72 hours; Table 12-6 (SMQ search) displays 9 “hypersensitivities”, 4 
“rashes”, and 2 “urticarias”. Brief and meaningful presentation of this clinically relevant entity of events is 
requested. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Overall, 3 PUPs experienced a total of 9 reactions indicative of hypersensitivity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/166753/2023

Safety evaluation of potential hypersensitivity reactions included the analyses of adverse events of special 
interest (AESIs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), as defined in the clinical study protocol 
and statistical analysis plan. 
AESIs  included  preferred  terms  (PTs)  associated  with  the  Standardized  MedDRA  Queries  (SMQs)  narrow 
search  terms  for  hypersensitivity.  The  SMQ  of  hypersensitivity  narrow  includes  PTs  of  Hypersensitivity, 
Rash, and Urticaria. All SMQ findings were subjected to medical review by the sponsor and were assessed 
for clinical relevance to ensure a comprehensive review of this topic. 
In contrast, TEAEs were grouped only by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and PT, and were not based 
on SMQs. 
Overall, the medical concept of hypersensitivity was described broadly as both AESIs and TEAEs: 
Thus,  the  apparent  divergence  noted  by  the  assessor  is  due  to  the  different  selection  criteria  for  these 
different analyses. While the data / analyses are consistent and correct, CSLB made some minor adjust-
ments for clarity in Section 2.5.5.2.2.2 of the Clinical Overview. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Three individuals experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity. From the header of the table it is not clear, if 
the last column (“within 72 h of rIX-FP”) reflects start or resolve of the symptoms. 
One patient suffered from two events of exanthema. This was rated as non-serios/non-related. 
A second patient suffered from whole-body-urticaria, and skin rash of both lower legs and both forearms, 
and of skin rash of the face and belly. No timely relationship has been presented. The first skin-rash was 
rated as “related”, the other events as non-related. It is not overt, if these latter events were at the same 
time. The rashes might be interpreted as “generalized”. The third patient is  the “inhibitor-patient” of 11 
years of age, who overall presented with an exceptional history. He experienced a hypersensitivity reaction, 
urticaria, and two allergic reactions, most of them rated as related. All of them resulted in drug interruption, 
and finally withdrawal. 
Overall, the description suggests some degree of hypersensitivity potential – not unusual in the respective 
population. Of note, the presented differentiated presentation of TEAEs and AESIs is not questioned. The 
amended explanations enlighten the relevant clinical context. 
Conclusion: Point is solved.

Question 12 
At  least  one  subject  experienced  an  SAE  of  “Device  Related  Infection”.  All  device  related  complications 
(including non-serious) should be presented, irrespective of causal relation. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
There  were  no  TEAEs  reported  for  Mix2Vial™,  the  Idelvion-specific  water  transfer  device,  ie,  no  device-
related complications occurred. 
There  were  2  cases  of  catheter-related  complications  per  preferred  and  reported  terms  (Table  9)  in  the 
context of use of a central venous catheter in young children, as part of standard clinical care: 1 SAE with 
reported  term  “hospital  admission  for  infected  portacath”  which  is  described  in  the  SAE  section  of  the 
Clinical Overview, and 1 nonserious event with preferred term Catheter site bruise that occurred in 1 other 
subject. Both events were not related to investigational product and resolved. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In addition to the previously described “Device related infection”, a serious (hospital admission) portacath 
infection, one further device related complication has been documented. This latter was a non-serious port-
site bruising which lasted 27 days, and resolved. 
The number and clinical presentation is in accordance with complications recorded for similar substitution 
products used in this respective age-group.

Clinical Overview: 
Question 13 
Clinical Overview should be updated according to the assessment for presenting meaningful data. PK-results 
should be presented as median and range. Key efficacy and safety data should be amended according to 
the  assessment.  Presentation  of  inhibitor  development  should  rely  on  those  (6)  subjects  with  ≥50  EDs. 
Further,  other  significant  events  including  hypersensitivities  and  device-related  complications  should  be 
addressed, adequately. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
CSLB has amended the Clinical Overview to reflect the relevant information from above responses at the 
appropriate level of detail. A redline version of the Clinical Overview is provided in the working documents 
folder, the clean updated version in Module 2.5. 
CSLB does not address device-related complications in the Clinical Overview, as there were no TEAEs as-
sociated with the Mix2Vial™ water transfer device, and the 2 cases of catheter-

SmPC: 
Question 14 
Substantial  abbreviation  of  the  proposed  SmPC-amendments  is  requested,  according  to  the  assessment 
and to the comments made in the attached product information (please, refer to Attachment 1). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
CSLB agrees with the updates recommended by the rapporteur in section 4.2 of the SmPC and has made 
respective amendments in the SmPC. 
CSLB also agrees with the principle that only substantial results for the PUP population should be reflected 
in the SmPC. 
However, CSLB does not agree with the rapporteur´s conclusion that the PUP arm of Study CSL654_3003 
was stopped prematurely and for that reason would not contribute substantial results. The number of en-
rolled PUPs and study design were endorsed by PDCO “Opinion of PDCO on the acceptance of a modification 
of an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan” (EMEA-001107-PIP01-10-M04). CSLB performed the PUP study 
in accordance with the amended study protocol. In the PUP arm of CSL654_3003, 8 PUPs achieved ≥ 50 
EDs during on-demand, prophylaxis, surgical, and PK periods (see also CSLB’s responses to Questions 7 
and 8). For this reason, CSLB has not implemented the changes proposed by the rapporteur under Descrip-
tion of selected adverse reactions in section 4.8. The revised proposals for section 5.1 (including the number 
of PUPs with at least 50 EDs, originally proposed by the rapporteur for section 4.8) take into consideration 
the updates  made at the  request of the rapporteur in Module 2.5 Clinical Overview to ensure the SmPC 
provides meaningful information about PUPs that will be helpful for health professionals. 
For details, please refer to PIQ form and redlined SmPC text.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Proposed amendment of the SmPC is considered to be acceptable, in part.  
However, the wording in section 5.1 should still be reduced to the most relevant information in such narrow 
patient  collective.  More  detailed  information  on  the  study  is  available  through  the  EPAR  and  EU  Clinical 
Trials Register.

Question 15 
The MAH should update the summary of safety concerns to: 
Important identified risks 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity / anaphylactic reactions 
Development of inhibitors to factor IX 
Important potential risks 
• 
TEEs 
Missing information 
• 
• 
Experience in pregnancy and lactation, including labour and delivery 
Experience in elderly patients 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  acknowledges  the  assessor’s  comments  that  “experience  in  pregnancy  and  lactation  including 
labour  and  delivery”  and  “experience  in  geriatric  patients  (65  years  and  older)”  should  continue  to  be 
considered  missing  information  and  would  herewith  like  to  present  an  extended  rationale  for  removing 
these as “missing information” for the purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), despite there being 
limited information available in these patient groups. This is based on the general considerations regarding 
pharmacovigilance  activities  and  RMP  guidance  and  the  specific  arguments  provided  in  the  subsections 
below.  
The MAH would like to also clarify that removing these items as “missing information” for the purposes of 
RMP will not change our routine or additional pharmacovigilance activity, which will continue to include the 
Follow-Up-Questionnaire (FU-Q) for Experience in Pregnancy & Pregnancy Outcomes and our participation 
in the Haemophilia Network Registry: European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance (EUHASS) to obtain long-
term safety data including experience in elderly patients. These topics are routinely included in the PSURs 
as well.  
Following completion of the PUP study, the MAH has taken the opportunity to fully align with the concepts 
within  “GVP  Module  V  -  Risk  management  systems  (Rev  2)”  and  “Guidance  on  the  format  of  the  Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) in the EU – in integrated format” in updating the content of the EU-RMP. In par-
ticular, section V.B.1 – Principles of Risk Management of GVP module V, advises that “The RMP is a dynamic 
document that should be updated throughout the life cycle of the product(s)” and “Given the overall aim of 
obtaining more information regarding the risk-benefit balance in certain populations excluded in the preau-
thorization phase, it is expected that as the product matures, the classification as missing information might 
not be appropriate anymore once new data become available, or when there is no reasonable expectation 
that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance activities could further characterize the safety profile 
of the product with respect to the areas of missing information.”  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/166753/2023 
Page 45/55 
 
 
 
 
In addition, “missing information” is described as follows: “missing information for the purpose of the risk 
management  planning  refers  to  gaps  in  knowledge  about  the  safety  of  a  medicinal  product  for  certain 
anticipated utilization or for use in particular patient populations, for which there is insufficient knowledge 
to determine whether the safety profile differs from that characterized so far. The absence of data itself 
(e.g., exclusion of a population from clinical studies) does not automatically constitute a safety concern. 
Instead, the risk management planning should focus on situations that might differ from the known safety 
profile.”   
Experience in pregnancy and lactation including labour and delivery 
Given the guidance above, a major consideration  was whether any reasonable expectation exists in fur-
thering characterization of the safety profile of Idelvion in these patient populations.  
Hemophilia B is an X-chromosome linked recessive disorder; therefore, it is more substantially common in 
men  (87%)  than  in  women  (5%),  with  the  other  8%  where  information  on  gender  in  not  known  [WFH 
Global Survey, 2020]. The target population for Idelvion (rIX-FP) is predominantly male and this is further 
corroborated by a recent retrospective international chart review describing the real-world use of rIX-FP 
[Hermans et al, 2020]. Although female patients were not included in the clinical studies for rIX-FP, the 
MAH acknowledges the assessor’s comment that the safety profile in the female population is not known 
though being very unlikely to be different from that of males.  
The  predominant  use  of  rIX-FP  in  the  male  patient  population  is  further  validated  by  the  postmarketing 
safety data collected so far, with over 809,474,653 IU sold worldwide, corresponding to 289,098 standard 
doses, with an estimated exposure of 5560 patient years. The MAH has received only 5 reports concerning 
the use of rIX-FP in women. This includes 1 literature report describing a 31-year-old female hemophilia B 
carrier, who received a bolus injection of 6000 IU rIX-FP before vaginal delivery under epidural analgesia 
without any problems for herself and her child. No cases pertaining to lactation exposure with rIX-FP have 
been received from postmarketing reporting to date.  
Given the limitations of gathering data on pregnancy in patients with hemophilia B, the MAH also reviewed 
the postmarketing safety data for the MAH’s plasma-derived FIX products (pdFIX). Cumulatively until 31 
March  2022,  the  MAH  received  only  3  reports  concerning  the  use  of  pdFIX  in  females.  All  3  cases  were 
nonserious and reported 1 event each (Wrong product administered, Drug ineffective for unapproved indi-
cation, No adverse event). The event of No adverse event was reported in a pregnant female, who received 
pdFIX (INN). The potential for gathering sufficient pregnancy data to characterize the safety profile in this 
special female population is therefore very unlikely, given the target population for the product, based on 
its use in the real world against a backdrop of already small female patient pool with a significant proportion 
of females that are not of childbearing age, and in any given period, of those that are of childbearing age 
only a small fraction may consider pregnancy. A further consideration was whether the absence of data in 
this patient group represents an actual safety concern. To date the MAH has no evidence that the safety 
profile for rIX-FP in pregnant or breastfeeding women will be any different to the known safety profile of 
the  product.  Since  the  active  components  of  rIX-FP  are  recombinant  counterparts  of  naturally  occurring 
human plasma proteins, it is expected that rIX-FP will be catabolized in the same manner as endogenous 
FIX.  Therefore,  these  physiological  constituents  of  the  human  blood  are  not  expected  to  induce  adverse 
effects on reproduction or the fetus and effects on embryo toxicity and fertility are not expected. The MAH 
therefore considers it appropriate to remove “experience in pregnancy and lactation including labour and 
delivery” as missing information, as the revised GVP guidance states that the absence of data itself (eg, 
exclusion of a population from clinical studies) does not automatically constitute a safety concern. Also,

• 
• 
The potential for gathering sufficient pregnancy data to characterize the safety profile in this special 
population is unlikely, because the target population for rIX-FP is predominantly male, as validated 
from the postmarketing and literature evidence.  
To date, the MAH has no evidence that the safety profile for rIX-FP in pregnant or breastfeeding 
women will be any different to the known safety profile of the product.  
•  Routine pharmacovigilance activities would ensure all reports of special situations, ie, use during 
pregnancy and lactation, are followed up thoroughly with targeted FU-Qs and routinely discussed 
in PSURs as applicable; and  
• 
There  are  no  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  to  further  characterize  the  use  of  rIX-FP  in 
female patients.  
Experience in geriatric patients (65 years and older) 
The MAH agrees with the assessor’s comment that the safety in geriatric patients is not yet characterized 
adequately,  though  it  is  very  unlikely  to  be  different  from  the  currently  known  safety  profile.  Similar  to 
what is described above for “Pregnancy and lactation including labour and delivery”, the major considera-
tions for removal of this topic as “missing information” for RMP purposes was whether there is a reasonable 
expectation  to  further  characterize  the  safety  profile  in  the  geriatric  patient  population  and  whether  the 
absence of data in this patient group constitutes a safety concern. The clinical trial program for rIX-FP has 
not included elderly patients (> 65 years of age) and from the data obtained in the worldwide literature to 
date, there is a paucity of information regarding use of recombinant FIX products in individuals over 65 
years of age. Considering that the active components of rIX-FP are recombinant counterparts of naturally 
occurring  human  plasma  proteins,  it  can  be  hypothesized  that  similar  pharmacological  effects  could  be 
expected in this patient population as compared to younger patients. To date the MAH has no evidence that 
the safety profile for rIX-FP in the geriatric population will be any different to the known safety profile of 
the product. Cumulatively, 14 cases were reported for rIX-FP in the postmarketing experience in patients 
aged older than 65 years of age. Although the cases lacked sufficient information for further assessment, 
these cases  did not identify any safety relevant information specific to this age group and this topic will 
continue  to  be  routinely  discussed  in  the  PSURs.  This  topic  is  also  subject  to  the  MAH’s  routine  signal 
detection activities for all products, and therefore reviewed on an ongoing basis. Any findings from routine 
review will follow the MAH’s signal detection and evaluation procedures, and any signals will be reported in 
PSURs. The MAH therefore considers it appropriate to remove “experience in geriatric patients (65 years 
and older)” as missing information, as the revised GVP guidance states that the absence of data itself (eg, 
exclusion of a population from clinical studies) does not automatically constitute a safety concern. Also,  
• 
• 
The active components of rIX-FP are recombinant counterparts of naturally occurring human plasma 
proteins, and similar pharmacological effects could be expected in geriatric patients.  
To date the MAH has no evidence that the safety profile for rIX-FP in the geriatric population will 
be any different to the known safety profile of the product.  
•  Routine pharmacovigilance activities including ongoing signal detection analysis will ensure that all 
reports involving use in special patient populations are followed up thoroughly.  
• 
The MAH’s participation in the Hemophilia Network Registry: European Haemophilia Safety Surveil-
lance (EUHASS) will continue to further collect any information on the use of rIX-FP in the geriatric 
population.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  provided  additional  rationale  for  removal  of  the  safety  concerns  "experience  in  pregnancy  and 
lactation  including  labour  and  delivery”  and  “experience  in  geriatric  patients  (65  years  and  older)”  from 
missing information. Overall, it is not supported that the risks can be removed from the safety concerns 
considering there is still lack of evidence on those risks and another safety profile cannot be excluded. In 
addition, as the cases that were reported provided limited information, no safety issues could be identified 
and therefore new information should be gathered. 
Furthermore, it was discussed that if these safety concerns are to be removed, the routine or additional 
pharmacovigilance activities would not change, considering the FU-Q for Experience in Pregnancy & Preg-
nancy Outcomes and participation in the (EUHASS) registry to obtain long-term safety data including ex-
perience in elderly patients would continue. However, following GVP V, both pharmacovigilance activities 
and risk minimisation measures should be related to specific safety concerns. Therefore, since experience 
in pregnancy and elderly should remain in the safety concerns, these aspects should also remain throughout 
the RMP. An update of the RMP with inclusion of these risks is requested.  
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved. 
Question 16 
The MAH should include “patients with severe renal and hepatic impairment”, “medication errors” and “Ex-
perience in patients for ITI (off-label use)” for monitoring in the PSUR for further evaluation. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH would like to confirm that “patients with severe renal and hepatic impairment”, “medication er-
rors”, and “experience in patients for ITI (off-label use)” will be monitored in the PSUR for further evalua-
tion. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH will monitor “patients with severe renal and hepatic impairment”, “medication errors” and “expe-
rience in patients for ITI (off-label use)” in the PSUR as requested.

Question 17 
The FU-Q for missing information of Experience in pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes should remain as 
routine pharmacovigilance activity. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As noted in response to Question 15, the MAH would like to confirm that removing these items as “missing 
information”  for  the  purposes  of  RMP  will  not  change  our  routine  pharmacovigilance  activity,  which  will 
continue to include the FU-Q for Experience in pregnancy. The pregnancy reporting form is routinely used 
in the MAH to obtain information on all spontaneously reported pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes for 
all the MAH products, regardless of whether experience during “pregnancy and lactation including labour 
and delivery” is considered a safety concern or not. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has discussed that the FU-Q for “Experience in pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes” will remain 
in the RMP. This is not accepted as pharmacovigilance activities such as FU-Qs should be related to a specific 
safety concern. Following assessment of the response in question 15, it is not accepted to remove experi-
ence in pregnancy and lactation, including labour and delivery from the safety concerns. Therefore, the FU-
Q should remain routine pharmacovigilance activity throughout the RMP. An update of the RMP is requested. 
Experience in pregnancy and lactation should also be discussed in the PSURs. 
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved. 
Question 18 
The elderly population (>65 years) should remain part of participation in EUHASS to collect long-term safety 
data (additional pharmacovigilance activity). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As  noted  in  response  to  Question  15,  the  MAH  would  like  to  also  clarify  that  removing  these  items  as 
“missing information” for the purposes of RMP will not change our routine or additional pharmacovigilance 
activity. The MAH will continue our participation in the Haemophilia Network Registry: European Haemo-
philia Safety Surveillance (EUHASS) to obtain long-term safety data including experience in elderly patients. 
These topics will be routinely included in the PSURs as applicable. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has clarified that the elderly population will remain to be analysed in the EUHASS registry and 
discussed  in  the  PSURs.  Considering  the  elderly  population  (>65  years)  was  not  accepted  to  remove  as 
missing information from the safety concerns, the RMP should include information of the elderly population 
in EUHASS. An update is requested. 
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved. 
RMP version 4.0 with DLP 26 January 2022 and date of final sign off 01 April 2022 is not acceptable.

Question 1 
(From Q 14) Abbreviation of the proposed SmPC-amendments is still requested, considering the narrow 
data-base (please, refer to Attachment). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
CSLB agrees with abbreviations proposed by Rapporteur for SmPC. 
CSLB proposes to indicate in section 4.8 Undesirable effects that in PUP study was reported one case with 
hight-titre inhibitor, that would provide more accurate information and help to evade misinterpretation. 
Also, CSLB proposes to add in section 5.1, subsection Clinical efficacy information on annualized sponta-
neous bleeding rate (AsBR) and believes that this information is relevant for physicians and provides im-
portant information especially for paediatric population, because AsBR doesn’t depend on lifestyle and 
isn’t related to traumatic or surgical bleedings. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH proposes to reflect the number of “one” inhibitor in the population of the PUP study (section 
4.8). It was, however, intended to avoid the misleading “incidence” of 1 in 8 PUPs (12.5%) with >50 EDs. 
This is overtly much higher than the rare inhibitor incidence in Hemophilia B (1.5-3%). Further, the re-
ported case was extraordinary, and might therefore unintendedly increase such “incidence”. However, the 
MAHs proposal is taken. 
Regarding reflection of “spontaneous” ABR: The theoretical idea as presented by the MAH (“AsBR does 
not depend on lifestyle”) is hampered by real infant’s life: It will be difficult to clearly discriminate e.g. 
between a non-recognized bagatelle-trauma – documented as a spontaneous bleed and a small trauma –
documented as a non-spontaneous bleed, especially in lively healthy infants under normal and not spe-
cific “neutral” observation. Therefore, the discrimination between ABR and AsBR is considered to be artifi-
cial, and potentially manipulable. Further, no standardized applicable and comparable definition is availa-
ble (please, also refer to the discussions in this Assessment Report). Thus, AsBR should not be reflected 
in section 5.1. 
Of note, due to inadvertent circumstances, changes in Section 5.1 of the SmPC-version from 20th Oct 
2022 have not been included, completely. These should also be taken. Please, refer to the attached docu-
ment. 
Conclusion 
The MAHs proposal regarding section 4.8 is taken. 
The MAH is asked to amend section 5.1 as proposed in the attached SmPC document. 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly.

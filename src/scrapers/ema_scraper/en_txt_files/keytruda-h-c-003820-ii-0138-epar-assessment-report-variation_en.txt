The biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) comprises a heterogeneous group of malignancies affecting the biliary 
tree that are distinguished based on the anatomical localisation (gallbladder, intrahepatic, perihilar, and 
distal/periampullary). Given the rare frequency of these tumours, the different subtypes are generally 
pooled together although carrying different epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, molecular 
features, and prognosis (Manne et al, 2021)1.

era of precision medicine and immuno-oncology’, Frontiers in Oncology, 11, pp. 1-16. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.768009.

State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The initially applied indication was: KEYTRUDA, in combination with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, is 
indicated for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma 
in adults. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
BTC is rare accounting for <1% of all human malignancies. The incidence ranges from 0.35 cases per 
100,000 in high-income countries to 40-fold in endemic parts of Asia and South America. Risk factors 
vary between subtypes and geographical regions. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammatory bowel 
disease, gallstones, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B and C, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and (in 
endemic areas) liver fluke infections, are associated with increased risk of BTC. Gallbladder cancer is also 
associated with obesity and female sex. Recently, diabetes, obesity and use of hormonal contraceptives 
have been identified as new risk factors for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (Valle et al., 2021)2 
(Rahman et al., 2021)3. 
Guidelines for imaging-based surveillance of patients with PSC are available (Berry et al., 2022)4. For the 
other at-risk clinical conditions, screening has not yet been established.  
Risk factors for BTC vary between regions depending on the prevailing etiopathogenesis. However, 
chronic inflammation of the biliary epithelium is a key feature characterising the different subtypes 
(Lazcano-Ponce et al., 2001)5.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Diffuse symptomatology and high-risk invasive diagnostics make biliary tract cancer challenging to 
diagnose and tumours are often advanced at diagnosis, contributing to the poor overall 5-year relative 
survival of only 14-16%. Despite variations in geographic distribution and risk factors, the approach to 
diagnosis and treatment remains the same. The majority of patients are diagnosed in advanced stage and 
are treated with systemic therapy. Patients presenting with earlier stage disease may undergo curative 
surgical resection; however, postoperative recurrence is reported in more than half of the patients. 
Overall, most patients are treated with systemic therapy and prognosis remains poor highlighting the 
unmet medical need for this condition (Kang et al., 2022)6. 
Management 
Chemotherapy has long been the SoC for first-line treatment of advanced BTC, and the cisplatin – 
gemcitabine doublet is the most commonly adopted therapy in the advanced stage of cancer, with a 
demonstrated survival advantage compared to gemcitabine alone. Oxaliplatin may be substituted for 
cisplatin in case of kidney disease, and gemcitabine monotherapy may be preferred in patients with poor

clinical performance (i.e. PS of 2 or other factors of fragility). The recently concluded TOPAZ-1 study 
provided evidence for improvement in OS with the immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab in addition to 
cisplatin-gemcitabine compared to chemotherapy alone. This combination has been included in the most 
up-to-date clinical guidance as recommended first-line treatment for advanced BTC (ESMO 2023)7. 
Alternative therapeutic schemes, including triplet regimens, are currently under investigation. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Pembrolizumab is a humanised mAb which binds to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and 
blocks its interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell 
activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA 
potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 
and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other 
cells in the tumour microenvironment. 
Since its first approval within Europe for the treatment of advanced melanoma in 2015, pembrolizumab 
has been licensed for a number of different malignancies, both as monotherapy or in association to 
chemotherapy. 
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA in adults is either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks 
administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No Scientific Advice was sought by the EMA during the development program of pembrolizumab for the 
BTC indication.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH claimed that the clinical studies were conducted in accordance with current standard research 
approaches with regard to the design, conduct, and analysis of such studies including the archiving of 
essential documents. All studies were conducted following appropriate Good Clinical Practice standards 
and considerations for the ethical treatment of human participants that were in place at the time the 
studies were performed. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA in adults is either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks 
administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. 
PK data form study KEYNOTE-966 were used in support of 200 mg Q3W as the recommended dose of 
pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in participants with advanced BTC. 
Substantial characterization of the PK and immunogenicity of pembrolizumab have been provided in 
previous submissions. In particular, pembrolizumab PK disposition has been characterized via pooled 
population PK analyses using serum concentration-time data contributed from subjects across various 
clinical studies using a time-dependent PK (TDPK) model. The PK reference dataset for monotherapy 
includes all available PK data from subjects enrolled on KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, 
KEYNOTE-010, and KEYNOTE-024, with an overall sample size of 2993. This serves as the PK reference 
analysis to support descriptions of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in the USPI and EU SmPC.

In addition to the dosing regimens of 200 mg Q3W or 2 mg/kg Q3W, the 400 mg Q6W dosing regimen 
was also approved in the EU for all adult monotherapy indications (procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0062) and for all adult indications in combination with other anticancer agents 
(procedure number EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0102).  
Absorption 
Pembrolizumab is dosed via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely 
bioavailable. 
Distribution 
Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at 
steady state is small (6.0 L; coefficient of variation [CV]: 20%). As expected for an antibody, 
pembrolizumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific manner. 
Elimination 
Pembrolizumab clearance (CL) is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) 
after achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]). 
The geometric mean value (CV%) for the terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state. 
Pharmacokinetic target population 
Considering that an extensive characterization of the PK and immunogenicity profile of pembrolizumab 
have been provided in previous submissions, in this submission the focus is on the data related to the 
characterization of the pharmacology for the combination of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy 
(gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 + cisplatin 25 mg/m2) in participants with advanced BTC. 
PK Data KEYNOTE-966 
KEYNOTE-966 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multisite, Phase 3 study, 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (gemcitabine and 
cisplatin) in participants with previously untreated advanced BTC. 
PK Analysis Pembrolizumab 
The objectives of the PK analysis were: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate pembrolizumab concentrations obtained from subjects in the study of KEYNOTE-966. 
To compare pembrolizumab PK data in KEYNOTE-966 observed in the pembrolizumab plus 
gemcitabine/cisplatin treatment arm with reference (TDPK) model-predicted pembrolizumab PK. 
To compare KEYNOTE-966 observed pembrolizumab PK data with historical monotherapy data.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Keytruda is an antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction 
with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been 
shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. Keytruda potentiates T-cell responses, 
including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are 
expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy setting is based on a 
sufficiently large dataset of patients across several indications, with very low observed rates of total 
treatment ADA across different pembrolizumab regimens (1.4 – 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing 
antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%). This analysis has not demonstrated impact on efficacy or safety, as currently 
Assessment report

summarized in the EU SmPC and USPI. This low rate of immunogenicity has been shown to be consistent 
across tumour type and no clinically meaningful consequences have been observed in the subjects with a 
positive immunogenicity reading. Additionally, incidence of ADA has not been impacted by the presence 
of another small molecule or chemotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new information regarding PK/PD modelling for pembrolizumab is available within this application. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In this application, the focus is on PK data related to the combination of pembrolizumab with 
chemotherapy (gemcitabine/cisplatin) from study KEYNOTE-966.  
Absorption 
The dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W is applicable across all adult indications regardless of the 
combination treatment type, thus, the 400 mg Q6W dosing regimen would have a similar benefit-risk 
profile as the 200 mg Q3W (or 2 mg/kg Q3W) dosing regimen in the clinical use of pembrolizumab in 
participants with BTC. 
Elimination 
Pembrolizumab clearance (CL) is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) 
after achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]); 
this decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value (CV%) for 
the terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state. 
Pharmacokinetic 
PK data from KEYNOTE-966 show that the observed pembrolizumab serum concentration values in 
subjects with advanced BTC are contained within the 90% CI of the reference PK model, which indicate 
consistency with the historical data, in both Cycle 1 postdose and Cycle 8 predose (at steady state). 
In addition, tabular summaries of descriptive statistics and boxplots from early drug treatment at Cycle 1 
end of infusion (post-dose) and at pre-dose Cycle 2 and Cycle 8 show that observed pembrolizumab 
concentrations of 200 mg (Q3W) in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine/cisplatin) from 
participants with advanced BTC in KEYNOTE-966 are similar to the observed pembrolizumab 
concentration when administered as monotherapy in other trials in different cancer indications. 
No new data on immunogenicity have been submitted within this application and this is acceptable 
considering that the incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADA) has been already evaluated in the presence of 
chemotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab. 
In conclusion, pembrolizumab PK disposition is not affected by the co-administration with chemotherapy, 
in particular by the co-administration of gemcitabine plus cisplatin. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pembrolizumab PK disposition is not affected by the co-administration with chemotherapy (gemcitabine 
plus cisplatin) for advanced BTC. Observed concentrations from KEYNOTE-966 overlaid on the reference

model predicted median concentrations both at Cycle 1 and at steady state and are consistent with other 
globally approved studies in different cancer indications. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The current submission is based on a single pivotal study (KEYNOTE-966). 
This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multisite, double-blind study of pembrolizumab 
plus chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin) versus placebo plus chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus 
cisplatin) in participants with advanced (metastatic) and/or unresectable (locally advanced) BTC (intra- or 
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder) (hereafter referred to as advanced BTC). 
The report is based on the final analysis (FA data cut-off date 15-DEC-2022).

Sample size 
Approximately 1048 participants were expected to be randomized 1:1 into pembrolizumab plus 
gemcitabine plus cisplatin or placebo plus gemcitabine plus cisplatin. After enrollment of the global 
portion was complete, the study remained open to enrolment in China alone for the China extension 
cohort of 46 participants until a total of 158 participants had been enrolled across the global and 
extension parts to meet local regulatory requirements in China. This report describes the global portion of 
the study. OS was the sole primary endpoint for the study, with PFS and ORR as the key secondary 
endpoints. The working model in evaluating the power of both OS and PFS analyses and projecting event 
accumulation with time assumed that both OS and PFS had an approximately 2-month delay in treatment 
effect.  
Assessment report  
EMA/534959/2023 
Page 22/104 
 
 
 
 
 
Specifically, the model assumed that the OS curves for the pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine/cisplatin arm 
and placebo plus gemcitabine/cisplatin arm coincided over the first 2 months with HR=1 and diverged 
when the treatment effect with constant HR=0.75 starts at 2 months. Based on a 11-month control 
median, under the delayed treatment effect model, the median of the pembrolizumab plus 
gemcitabine/cisplatin arm was estimated approximately 14.0 months (~3-month increment). For the OS 
endpoint, based on a target number of 818 events and 2 interim analyses, assuming HR=1 for the first 2 
months and HR=0.75 after 2 months, the study had approximately 93% power to reject the null 
hypothesis under the alternative hypothesis at an overall alpha level of 0.025 (1-sided). 
Regarding the PFS curves, the model assumes that for the pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine/cisplatin arm 
and placebo plus gemcitabine/cisplatin arm coincided over the first 2 months with HR=1 and diverge 
when the treatment effect with constant HR=0.7 starts at 2 months. Based on a 6-month control median, 
under the delayed treatment effect model, the median of pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine/cisplatin arm 
was estimated approximately 7.7 months (~1.6-month increment). For the PFS endpoint, if OS endpoint 
was successful, based on the expected number of 786 events at PFS final analysis, assuming HR=1 for 
the first 2 months and HR=0.7 after 2 months, the study had approximately 92% power to reject the null 
hypothesis under the alternative hypothesis at an overall alpha level of 0.0125 (1-sided). 
The sample size and power calculations for PFS and OS assumed the following: 1) PFS follows an 
exponential distribution with a median of 6 months for the control group; HR=1 for the first 2 months and 
HR=0.7 after 2 months; 2) OS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 11 months for the 
control group; HR=1 for the first 2 months and HR=0.75 after 2 months; 3) Enrollment period of 20 
months with a ramp-up period of 6 months; 4) A monthly drop-out rate of 2% and 0.1% for PFS and OS, 
respectively; 5) The interim and final analyses were planned at ~26, ~32 and ~38 months after the start 
of randomization and the minimum alpha spending approach is employed.  
If OS endpoint was successful, the ORR power calculation was based on the following assumptions: 1) 
under an overall alpha level of 0.0125; 2) the underlying ORR was 25% in the placebo 
+gemcitabine/cisplatin arm. The study had ~91% power to detect a true ORR rate difference of 10% 
(pembrolizumab + gemcitabine/cisplatin versus placebo +gemcitabine/cisplatin). 
The sample size and power calculations were performed using R (“gsDesign” and “simtrial” packages). 
Randomisation 
Treatment allocation/randomization occurred centrally using an interactive response technology (IRT) 
system. There are 2 study treatment arms. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
pembrolizumab or placebo each in combination with chemotherapy. Treatment randomization was 
stratified based on the following criteria:  
1) 
2) 
Region (Asia versus non-Asia);  
Locally Advanced versus Metastatic (in the event the participant has locally advanced and 
metastatic BTC, the participant should be stratified as metastatic); 
3) 
Site of Origin (gallbladder, intrahepatic, or extrahepatic). 
Blinding (masking) 
A double-blinding technique with in-house blinding will be used. Pembrolizumab and placebo (normal 
saline) will be packaged identically so that blind is maintained. The participant, the investigator, and 
Sponsor personnel or delegate(s) who are involved in the study intervention administration or clinical 
evaluation of the participants are unaware of the intervention assignments. 
Assessment report

As of the data cutoff for the FA, a total of 31 participants were prematurely unblinded as emergency 
unblindings and 1 of those emergency unblindings was inadvertent. A total of 62 nonemergency 
unblindings occurred for purposes of selection of subsequent therapy. Nonemergency unblindings 
required SCF approval and all critical data to be entered to decrease risk of bias. A total of 4 second 
course unblindings occurred to determine second course eligibility. Second course unblinding required 
centrally verified disease progression. The premature unblinding of these participants did not have a 
major impact on study conduct or on the outcome of the study, and none of these premature unblindings 
led to exclusion from the analysis. These unblinding events were reviewed via the Sponsor’s Significant 
Quality Issues process and were determined to have no impact on the quality of the data. 
Statistical methods 
Protocol Amendments involving statistical methods 
The protocol was subject to six general amendments, of which Amendment 2 (08-DEC-2020), 
Amendment 4 (26-AUG-2021) and Amendment 5 (18-NOV-2021) modified the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) language as follows. Statistical methods were reported in the protocol section and in the 
Amendment 04 of supplemental SAP (sSAP) dated 13-JUN-2022. 
Amendment 2 (08-DEC-2020): The protocol was revised to make OS the sole primary endpoint and to 
change PFS from a primary to a secondary endpoint. A more conservative hazard ratio assumption for OS 
was made accounting for possible delayed treatment effect; as consequence the sample size was 
increased from initial 788 to 1048 participants, to maintain study timelines and statistical power. The 
futility analysis was removed since early results are not informative in the presence of a delayed 
treatment effect. The interim and final analyses timing was updated from calendar-based to event-based 
and the multiple strategy was also updated to allocate all initial alpha to OS as a single primary endpoint 
and split the alpha equally between ORR and PFS when OS demonstrated superiority. Two interim 
analyses (IAs) were planned at ~500 OS events (~29 months) and ~616 OS events (~35 months), 
respectively. The FA was planned after the occurring of ~725 OS events (~41 moths from the start of 
randomization). 
Amendment 4 (26-AUG-2021): The SAP was updated to account for faster event accumulation than 
initially projected by increasing the number of events at final analysis and specifying time and event 
triggers for analyses to ensure sufficient minimum follow-up time for a longer potential delayed effect. 
The first IA was removed and the number of OS events at each analysis was increased. The IA was 
planned after ~695 OS events (~32 months) and the FA was planned after ~818 OS events (~38 
months). The analyses were triggered by required time and OS events, the minimum alpha spending 
approach for OS analysis was used and the group-sequential analysis of PFS and ORR was changed to a 
single analysis at the time of OS interim analysis. 
Amendment 5 (18-NOV-2021): A new, earlier interim analysis (IA1) for OS was added to take into 
account the emerging external data showing positive results for immunotherapy plus chemotherapy as 
first-line therapy for patients with advanced biliary tract carcinoma. The IA1 was planned at ~585 OS 
events (~26 months), the IA2 was planned at ~695 OS events (~32 months) and the FA was planned 
after ~818 OS events (~38 months).  
Additional details on protocol amendments can be found under “conduct of the study” below.

Interim analysis 
Two interim analyses (IA) were planned in addition to the final analysis (FA) for this study. The efficacy 
analyses in this submission are based on FA. The timing and the purpose of each analysis are 
summarized in the table below. 
Table 7 KEYNOTE-966: Purpose of Interim Analyses and Final Analysis 
Type I error and multiplicity control 
The trial used the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz to control for multiple hypotheses as well as 
interim analyses. According to this approach, study hypotheses may be tested more than once, and when 
a particular null hypothesis is rejected, the alpha allocated to that hypothesis can be reallocated to other 
hypotheses. Figure below shows the multiplicity diagram for type I error control.  
Figure 4 KEYNOTE-966: Multiplicity diagram for Type I error control 
Initial one-sided α allocation for each hypothesis in the ellipse representing the hypothesis. The weights 
for reallocation from each hypothesis to the others were represented in the boxes on the lines connecting

hypotheses. The initial α assigned to OS will be 0.025. If OS hypothesis was rejected, the corresponding 
alpha was reallocated equally to PFS and ORR. If the PFS hypothesis was rejected, the corresponding 
alpha was reallocated to ORR. If the ORR hypothesis was rejected, the corresponding alpha was 
reallocated to PFS. Within each endpoint, the Type I error control across the interim and final analyses 
has been maintained by the use of the Lan-DeMets spending function approach with O’Brien-Fleming 
boundaries. 
OS 
The initial α-level for testing OS is 0.025. Under the alternative hypothesis, the treatment effect were 
delayed by 2 months, with OS HR=1 in the first 2 months, and HR=0.75 after 2 months. Table below 
shows the boundary properties for OS hypothesis testing based on the minimum alpha spending strategy 
using a Lan-DeMets spending function approximating O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. 
Table 8 KEYNOTE-966: Boundary properties for OS hypothesis testing based on the minimum alpha 
spending strategy 
The bounds provided were based on the assumption that the number of OS events at IA1, IA2 and FA are 
585, 695 and 818, respectively. At the time of an analysis, the observed number of events may differ 
substantially from the expected. To avoid overspending at an interim analysis and leave reasonable alpha 
for the FA, the minimum alpha spending strategy has been adopted. At an IA, the information fraction 
Assessment report

Page 26/104 
 
 
 
 
 
used in Lan-DeMets spending function to determine the alpha spending at the IA was based on the 
minimum of the expected information fraction and the actual information fraction at each analysis. 
Specifically, the information fraction was calculated as the observed number of events at the IA over the 
target number of events at the FA, if the observed number of events was less than the expected, or as 
the expected number of events at the IA over the target number of events at FA, if the observed number 
of events exceeded the expected number. The FA used the remaining Type I error that has not been 
spent at the earlier analyses. The event counts for all analyses were used to compute the correlations. 
PFS 
The PFS hypothesis was not allocated any alpha initially and might only be tested when the OS was 
successful. The study tested PFS at IA1 (final PFS analysis). The p-value based on PFS data observed at 
IA1 was calculated and compared to its corresponding p-value bound when OS demonstrated superiority 
and alpha for PFS test became available. At IA2 and FA data cutoff a descriptive analysis of PFS might 
also be provided when superiority in OS was demonstrated. Following the outlined multiplicity strategy, 
the PFS hypothesis might be tested at α=0.0125 (if the OS null hypothesis was rejected), or at α=0.025 
(if both the OS and ORR null hypotheses were rejected). Under the alternative, the treatment effect was 
delayed by 2 months, with PFS HR=1 in the first 2 months, and HR=0.7 after 2 months. The boundary 
properties and power for each of these alpha levels are shown below. 
Table 9 KEYNOTE-966: Boundary properties and power for each alpha level (PFS) 
ORR 
The ORR hypothesis was not allocated any alpha initially and might only be tested when the OS was 
successful. The study tested ORR at IA1 (final ORR analysis). The p-value based on ORR data observed at 
IA1 was calculated and compared to its corresponding p-value bound when OS demonstrated superiority 
and alpha for ORR test becomes available. At IA2 and FA data cutoff a descriptive analysis of ORR might 
also be provided when superiority in OS was demonstrated. Table below shows the boundary properties 
for 2 possible 1-sided α-levels as well as the approximate treatment difference required to reach the 
boundary (ORR difference) which were derived using a Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming spending function.

Efficacy analyses 
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, which consisted of all 1069 randomized participants, served as 
the population for primary efficacy analyses. All randomized participants were included in this population. 
Participants were included in the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of whether 
they received study treatment. The duration of response (DOR) analysis was based on the population of 
responders (participants that achieved complete or partial response). A summary of the analysis strategy 
for key efficacy endpoints as well as censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses of PFS and DOR 
are presented in the following tables:

Table 12 Censoring Rules for Primary and Sensitivity Analyses of PFS 
The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate the PFS and OS curve in each 
treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS and OS was assessed by the stratified log-rank test. For 
PFS and OS a stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was used to 
assess the magnitude of the treatment difference between the treatment arms. The hazard ratio (HR) and 
its 95% confidence interval (CI) from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and 
with a single treatment covariate was reported. The same stratification factors used for randomization 
were applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. At FA of SOS, a sensitivity 
analysis based on the MaxCombo test with logrank FH (0, 1), FH (1, 1) might be performed to account for 
the potential loss of power with logrank test in case of proportional hazard assumption violation. In order

to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint, 2 sensitivity analyses with different sets of censoring 
rules were performed, as described in the table above. 
The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with weights proportional to the stratum size was used for 
the comparison of the ORR between the two treatment groups. The point estimate of ORR was provided 
by treatment group, together with a 95% CI using the exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and 
Pearson (1934). The stratification factors used for randomization were applied to the analysis. The 
descriptive analysis of ORR based on all participants was performed after IA1. No formal hypothesis 
testing was conducted. 
DOR was summarised descriptively using Kaplan-Meier medians and quartiles. Only the subset of patients 
who showed a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were included in this analysis. For each 
DOR analysis, a corresponding summary of the censoring reasons for responding participant were also 
provided. Responding subjects who were alive, had not progressed, had not initiated new anti-cancer 
treatment, had not been determined to be lost to follow-up, and had a disease assessment within 
~5 months of the data cutoff date were considered ongoing responders at the time of analysis. If a 
subject met multiple criteria for censoring, the censoring criterion that occurred earliest was applied.  
There were 3 stratification factors used for randomization: geographic region (Region 1: Asia versus 
Region 2: Non-Asia), locally advanced versus metastatic, and site of origin 
(gallbladder/intrahepatic/extrahepatic). The analysis stratification was based on the value of the 
randomization factor entered into the IVRS. For the purpose of analysis, some of the small strata among 
the 12 strata formed by the 3 factors were combined to ensure sufficient number of participants and 
events in each stratum. The stratification cells were pooled to form the following 10 analysis strata that 
were used in all stratified analyses: 
1. Asia and Locally Advanced and [Extrahepatic or Gallbladder] 
2. Asia and Locally Advanced and Intrahepatic 
3. Asia and Metastatic and Gallbladder 
4. Asia and Metastatic and Extrahepatic 
5. Asia and Metastatic and Intrahepatic 
6. Non-Asia and Locally Advanced and [Extrahepatic or Gallbladder] 
7. Non-Asia and Locally Advanced and Intrahepatic 
8. Non-Asia and Metastatic and Gallbladder 
9. Non-Asia and Metastatic and Extrahepatic 
10. Non-Asia and Metastatic and Intrahepatic 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup Analyses and Effect of Baseline Factors were planned. To determine whether the treatment 
effect was consistent across various subgroups, the between-group treatment effect for OS, PFS, and 
ORR (with a nominal 95% CI) was estimated and plotted by treatment group within each category of the 
following classification variables: Geographic region (Region 1: Asia versus Region 2: Non-Asia); Locally 
advanced versus metastatic; Site of origin (gallbladder/intrahepatic/extrahepatic); Age category (<65, ≥
65 years); Gender (female, male); Biliary stent and or a biliary drain (yes, no); Antibiotics within 1 month 
of study start (yes, no); Prior radiation (yes, no); Prior chemotherapy (yes, no); Prior PDT (yes, no); 
Smoking status (never, former, current); Microsatellite instability (MSI) status (microsatellite stable

(MSS), microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), indeterminate); PD-L1 CPS1 (CPS ≥1, CPS<1, 
indeterminate); PD-L1 CPS10 (CPS≥10, CPS<10, indeterminate); ECOG performance status at 
randomization (0 vs. 1).  
The consistency of the treatment effect was assessed descriptively via summary statistics by category for 
the classification variables listed above. If the number of participants in a category of a subgroup variable 
was less than 5% of the ITT population, the subgroup analysis could not be performed for that category 
of the subgroup variable. The subgroup analyses for PFS and OS were conducted using an unstratified 
Cox model, and the subgroup analyses for ORR were conducted using the unstratified Miettinen and 
Nurminen method. 
Safety analyses 
Safety analyses were based on the All Participants as Treated (APaT) population, which included all 1063 
randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention; participants were analyzed 
according to the study intervention they received. The primary safety analyses will include only events 
that occurred before the Second Course Treatment. The analysis of safety results followed a tiered 
approach. There were no Tier 1 endpoints in this study, and Tier 2 parameters were assessed via point 
estimates with 95% CIs provided for differences in the proportion of participants with events using the 
Miettinen and Nurminen (M&N) method, an unconditional, asymptotic method. Membership in Tier 2 
required that at least 10% of participants in any treatment group exhibit the event. All other adverse 
experiences belonged to Tier 3; only point estimates by intervention arm were provided for Tier 3 safety 
parameters. Because many 95% CIs were provided without adjustment for multiplicity, the analysis 
represents a helpful descriptive measure to be used in review, not a formal method for assessing the 
statistical significance of the between-group differences. 
ePRO analysis 
The patient-reported outcomes (PRO) were tertiary/exploratory objectives in KEYNOTE-966, and thus no 
formal hypotheses were formulated. Nominal p-value to compare the pembrolizumab plus 
gemcitabine/cisplatin arm to placebo plus gemcitabine/cisplatin arm might be provided as appropriate. 
The PRO instruments are EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BIL21 and EQ-5D-5L. The PRO analyses were 
based on the PRO full analysis set (FAS) population, defined as participants who had received at least 1 
dose of study intervention and had completed at least 1 PRO assessment.  Participants were analyzed in 
the intervention group to which they were randomized. PRO FAS populations might be different across 
EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BIL21, and EQ-5D-5L.

Table 13 Disposition of participants (ITT population) 
Median duration of follow-up for the FA in the ITT population, defined as the time from randomization to 
death or DCO, whichever was earlier, was 12.7 months (range: 0.2, 37.5 months) and 10.9 months 
(range: 0.2, 36.2 months) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and placebo plus 
chemotherapy group, respectively. 
The median time from randomization to DCO in the ITT population was 25.6 months (range 18.3 to 38.4 
months) for the FA. Certain efficacy analyses presented are based on the IA1 DCO (15-DEC-2021) and 
the median time from randomization to DCO in the ITT population for IA1 was 13.6 months (range 6.3 to 
26.4 months).

Recruitment 
The study was conducted in 185 centres in 24 countries/regions. Clinical investigator study sites were 
located in the following countries/regions: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, 
France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, South 
Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the US. 
A total of 1564 participants were screened, and 495 nonrandomized participants were screen failures. 
Nonrandomized participants who did not meet inclusion criteria or meet exclusion criteria are summarized 
below: 
Table 14 Summary of non-randomized participants who did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet 
exclusion criteria 
As of the DCO (15-DEC-2022) for the FA, a total of 1069 participants were randomized in the ITT 
population (533 in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 536 in the placebo plus 
chemotherapy group).  
Conduct of the study 
Changes in the conduct of the study implemented by protocol amendment are summarized in the 
following table. There were no changes in the planned conduct of the study implemented by protocol 
amendment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Table 15 KEYNOTE-966: Summary of changes in the conduct of the study implemented by protocol 
amendment 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 95 participants (8.9%). Of these, 30 (2.8%) participants 
had important protocol deviations that were considered to be clinically important (Table 16). Most of the 
protocol deviations considered to be clinically important (n=15, 1.4%) were due to improperly stored 
study intervention. 
A listing of important protocol deviations is presented by participant, study site, and clinical importance in 
the table below. No participant’s data were excluded from analyses due to an important protocol 
deviation. One deviation was classified as a serious GCP compliance issue. This involved the use of 
incorrect ALT reference ranges caused by a change in equipment in which 1 participant was enrolled but 
later identified to not meet eligibility ALT criteria based on the correct reference ranges. It was 
determined that there was no impact to safety.

Table 22 Study populations 
The efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population of 1069 randomized participants except for the 
DOR analysis that was based on the population of the responders. 
The PRO analyses were based on the PRO FAS population, defined as participants who had received at 
least 1 dose of study intervention and had completed at least 1 PRO assessment. Participants were 
analyzed in the intervention group to which they were randomized. PRO FAS populations may be different 
across EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BIL21, and EQ-5D-5L. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint of OS was analysed at FA. At DCO for FA, 15-DEC-2022 (38.4 months from 
start of randomization) a total of 857 OS events were observed. The analyses of PFS, ORR, and DOR 
(secondary endpoints) were prespecified in the protocol to be based on IA1 data (15-DEC-2021 DCO). 
Descriptive analyses for secondary endpoints of PFS, ORR and DOR based on FA were also provided.

PFS 
At IA1 (15-DEC-2021), the observed point estimate for PFS HR favoured pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy though it did not meet statistical significance when compared with placebo plus 
chemotherapy (HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.00; p=0.0225); the p-value was greater than the p-value 
boundary of 0.0125 for statistical significance.  
Median PFS was 6.5 months (95% CI: 5.7, 6.9) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and 5.6 months 
(95% CI: 5.1, 6.6) in the placebo plus chemotherapy groups, respectively.

Exploratory endpoints 
Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) 
From baseline to Week 18, the prespecified exploratory PRO endpoints using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (global 
health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL), physical functioning, role functioning), EORTC QLQ-BIL21 (pain 
and jaundice scores), and EQ-5D-5L VAS for participants receiving pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
were similar to those treated with placebo plus chemotherapy. From baseline to Week 18, Health-related 
Quality of Life (HRQoL) was maintained when pembrolizumab was added to chemotherapy. 
For the GHS/QoL and functional domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30, a higher score denotes better health. 
For the symptom domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BIL21, a higher score indicates 
worsening of symptoms or more symptom burden.  
EORTC QLQ-C30 
From baseline to Week 18, LSM changes in the prespecified EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL, physical 
functioning, and role functioning scores were similar between the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group and the placebo plus chemotherapy group.

• 
The Least squares mean (LSM) score difference for GHS/QoL was 0.04 points (95% CI: -2.52, 
2.60), with a nominal p value (not adjusted for multiplicity) of 0.9773. 
• 
The LSM score difference for physical functioning was 1.24 (95% CI: -1.42, 3.90), nominal p-
value (not adjusted for multiplicity): 0.3596 and for role functioning was 2.68 (95% CI: -0.76, 6.11), 
nominal p-value (not adjusted for multiplicity): 0.1264.  
• 
The Time-to-deterioration (TTD) was similar between the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group and the placebo plus chemotherapy group for GHS/QoL with the median not reached in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus 21.22 months in the placebo plus chemotherapy group 
(HR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.07; nominal p=0.1644), physical functioning (median NR vs 11.99 months; 
HR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.78, 1.17; nominal p=0.6412), and role functioning (median 6.47 months vs 5.75 
months; HR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.18; nominal p=0.8326).  
EORTC QLQ-BIL21 
• 
From baseline to Week 18, LSM changes in EORTC QLQ-BIL21 scores were similar between the 2 
treatment groups. LSM score differences were as follows: jaundice=0.26 (95% CI: -1.35, 1.87; nominal 
p=0.7535), and pain= -1.87 (95% CI: -4.26, 0.53; nominal p=0.1265). 
• 
TTD in EORTC QLQ-BIL21 was similar between the 2 groups for jaundice (median TTD was NR for 
both groups; HR=1.20; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.54; nominal p=0.1468) and pain (median TTD was NR for both 
groups; HR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.05; nominal p=0.1064). 
EQ-5D-5L 
Results from the EQ-5D analyses were consistent with the results of EORTC QLQ-C30 analyses. From 
baseline to Week 18, LSM changes in EQ-5D-5L VAS scores were similar between the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group and the placebo plus chemotherapy group. LSM score difference was 0.14 (95% CI: 
-2.18, 2.46; nominal p=0.9058).

Notes 
Primary efficacy endpoint of OS was analysed at FA (DCO for FA is 15-DEC-2022). 
The analyses of PFS, ORR, and DOR (secondary endpoints) were prespecified in the 
protocol to be based on IA1 data (15-DEC-2021 DCO) 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-966 was a superiority trial designed to demonstrate advantage of pembrolizumab in association 
with gemcitabine plus cisplatin over duplex chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy in patients with 
locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic BTC (intra- or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or 
gallbladder). 
Based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a broad population in terms of cancer site and hepatitis 
status was eligible for recruitment, although limited to relatively fit patients (PS 0-1). Histologically 
confirmed diagnosis of BTC was requested. Exposure to prior systemic therapies was an exclusion 
criterion, with the exception of neo-adjuvant/adjuvant treatments not containing gemcitabine and/or 
cisplatin. Participants who received prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy with R2 resection were excluded. 
Overall, the study population can be considered representative of the advanced/metastatic BTC setting.   
Pembrolizumab was tested at a dose of 200 mg IV Q3W, in line with the licensed posology for KEYTRUDA 
as monotherapy and combination with chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab was administrated on top of a 
backbone therapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin. The chemotherapeutic scheme adopted in KEYNOTE-
966 can be considered standard and in line with current clinical recommendations. The association of 
gemcitabine and cisplatin represents the most common front-line approach in BTC patients, although 
other gemcitabine-based regimens are available. However, the study population recruited in KEYNOTE-
966 does not provide representativeness of alternative chemotherapeutic schemes generally used in 
cisplatin-unfit patients carrying a worse prognosis and reduced effect of therapies; moreover, the 
tolerability in association with pembrolizumab cannot be predicted in this more frail subgroup that have

not been included in the pivotal trial. The wording in section 4.1 of the SmPC was revised  to clearly 
reflect the tested chemotherapeutic agents adopted in the pivotal trial: KEYTRUDA, in combination with 
gemcitabine-based chemotherapy gemcitabine and cisplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of 
locally advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma in adults.   
The primary endpoint was OS, which is endorsed in an aggressive disease setting such as BTC. 
Secondary endpoints include PFS per RECIST 1.1, ORR (CR or PR) and DoR as assessed by BICR, which 
are also supported for the efficacy evaluation. Among tertiary endpoints, PFS, ORR and DoR as 
evaluated by Investigators, disease control (DC) rate, time-to-deterioration (TTT) and Quality of Life 
(QOL) questionnaires, are considered adequate. Efficacy by PD-L1 status (CPS ≥1 versus <1, and 
additional cutoff ≥10) was not pre-specified but rather included in the exploratory outcomes. The primary 
efficacy endpoint of OS was analysed at FA. The PFS, ORR, and DOR (secondary endpoints) were 
prespecified in the protocol to be evaluated on the basis of IA1 data (15 DEC-2021 data cutoff). The 
median time from randomization to DCO in the ITT population was 25.6 months (range 18.3 to 38.4 
months) for the FA and 13.6 months (range 6.3 to 26.4 months) for the IA1. 
Approximately 1048 participants were expected to be randomized 1:1 into pembrolizumab plus 
gemcitabine plus cisplatin or placebo plus gemcitabine plus cisplatin. After the enrollment of the global 
portion was complete, the study remained open to enrolment in China alone for the China extension 
cohort of 46 participants until a total of 158 participants had been enrolled across the global and 
extension parts to meet local regulatory requirements in China. This report describes the global portion of 
the study. The sample size calculation is comprehensible and reproducible. Of the six amendments to 
the protocol, only amendment 2 (08-DEC-2020) affected the sample size and power calculation; the 
sample size was increased from the initial 788 to 1048 participants to maintain study timelines and 
statistical power. The final number of randomized participants was 1069.  
The ITT population served as the population for the primary efficacy analyses of OS. All randomly 
assigned participants were included in this population. The efficacy analyses of OS in this submission 
were based on FA (DCO 15-DEC-2022), which was the third analysis of OS. At the FA data cut-off, 
descriptive analyses for key secondary endpoints of PFS and ORR were provided since the final analyses 
for these endpoints were performed at IA1 (DCO 15-DEC-2021). 
Statistical methods were well reported in the protocol section and in the Amendment 04 of 
supplemental SAP (sSAP) dated 13-JUN-2022, which represents its latest version. Overall, statistical 
methods are considered appropriate: the overall type I error over the primary endpoints (OS) and the key 
secondary endpoint (PFS and ORR) is strongly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided), with initially 2.5% 
allocated to OS (H1); by using the graphical approach of Mauer and Bretz if OS hypothesis was rejected, 
the corresponding alpha was reallocated equally to PFS and ORR; if the PFS hypothesis was rejected, the 
corresponding alpha was reallocated to ORR; if the ORR hypothesis was rejected, the corresponding alpha 
was reallocated to PFS.   
There were six protocol amendments over the study course, among these only amendments 2, 4 and 5 
affected the SAP language. Amendment 2 (08-DEC-2020) brought the most significant changes, since the 
primary endpoints of the study were modified, a more conservative hazard ratio assumption for OS was 
made accounting for possible delayed treatment effect and, consequently, the sample size was increased 
from the initial 788 to 1048 participants, in order to maintain study timelines and statistical power. The 
rationale for these amendments was exhaustively explained.  
Important protocol deviations were within acceptable limits (8.9%); the most frequently reported 
reason among those considered of clinical relevance (2.8%), was the improper storage of study drug 
(1.4%). One case of serious GCP breach without safety impact was reported, due to the use of incorrect 
ALT reference ranges that caused the erroneous recruitment of a patient not meeting the eligibility 
criteria. Overall, no concerns arise as regards the conduct of the study.

Sensitivity analyses were adequate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The current application is based on the FA (DCO: 15-DEC-2022) of study KEYNOTE-966 for the primary 
endpoint OS, while secondary endpoints were formally tested at IA1 (DCO: 15-DEC-2021) although 
descriptive statistics were provided at the final analysis. 
As of the data cutoff for FA (15-DEC-2022), 1564 subjects were screened with 1069 being randomized 
(533 to pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine/cisplatin and 536 to placebo plus gemcitabine plus cisplatin), 
while 495 (31.6%) non-randomized participants were screen failures since they did not meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 6 participants (pembrolizumab arm: 4; placebo arm: 2) were 
randomized but did not receive the study treatment. The screen failure rate was higher than expected, 
mostly associated with inappropriate organ function (haematological, renal and liver) as defined by the 
inclusion criteria. Concomitant disease-associated liver dysfunction at baseline was the main reason for 
screen failure in KEYNOTE-966, as it was for the TOPAZ-1 trial testing durvalumab combination in the 
same indication. It is common practice that gemcitabine administration in patients with liver dysfunction 
needs to be carefully monitored due to the anticipated liver toxicity that in a combination therapy is 
expected to increase. Yet, treatment with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy is not contraindicated in the 
presence of liver dysfunction and there is a wide experience with the use of chemotherapy in this clinical 
setting. A specification of liver function of patients enrolled in KEYNOTE-966 (serum bilirubin levels (≤1.5 
x ULN or direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 × ULN) and resolved 
clinically significant biliary obstruction) as defined in the protocol has been reported in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC for an appropriate information to treating physicians. 
At the time of FA (15-DEC-2022) median time to data cut-off was of 25.6 months (range: 18.3; 38.4), 
with a median follow-up of 12.7 (range: 0.2; 37.5) and 10.9 (range: 0.2; 36.2) months in the 
experimental and control arm, respectively. In total, 857 OS events over 818 required were observed 
(414 in pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm and 443 in placebo + chemotherapy arm), based on which 
the study can be considered mature. 
The 80.4% of the population underwent discontinuation from the trial, (77.7% vs 83.2% in the 
pembrolizumab and placebo group, respectively), the main reason being death in both treatment groups 
(76.7% vs 82.6%).  Discontinuation from study medication was registered in 93.4% of participants, 
occurring at an almost equal rate in both arms (92.4% vs 94.4 in the pembrolizumab and placebo group, 
respectively). Progressive disease was the most common reason (61.2% and 66.3% in the 
pembrolizumab and placebo group, respectively) while adverse events contributed to only a minority of 
cases (12.7% vs 11.4% in the pembrolizumab and placebo group, respectively). At the time of FA, 
treatment was ongoing in 4.7% of the ITT (5.1% vs 4.3% in the pembrolizumab and placebo, 
respectively). 
Baseline and disease characteristics were well balanced between groups. In the recruited population, 
there was a slight predominance of male patients (51.6% vs 48.4% for female sex), age was 64.0 years 
in median. Asians and non-Asians were almost equally represented, but Western Europe was a minority 
(28.3%) among regions, with a dominance of Rest of the World (63.8%). The prevailing tumour site was 
intrahepatic (59.2%) compared to the gallbladder (21.8%) and extrahepatic location (19%). Metastatic 
was more frequent than advanced disease (88.2% vs 11.8%, respectively). No major differences could be 
observed between treatment arms in the anatomical distribution of metastases. Liver (58.9% and 56%) 
and lymph nodes (58.2% and 54.7%) were the prevailing sites in both groups, followed by respiratory 
(29.8% and 27.2%) and peritoneum (24.4% and 24.3%). Other locations were also similarly affected, 
with the exception of a slightly higher prevalence of metastases in the abdomen cavity wall and organs

(other than liver) in the placebo group (7.9% and 10.6%).All these baseline characteristics are expected 
according with the disease epidemiology. Patients were almost all HCV negative (96.7%) with only a 
minority having a prior HCV infection (2.9%); the majority of the population was HBV negative (68.5%), 
28% had a clinically resolved prior infection and 2.8% a chronic HBV infection. In terms of tumour 
hallmarks, the PDL-1 status was similar between groups, with a higher frequency of CPS≥1 (68.1%) than 
CPS<1 (20.9%); in a not negligible portion of tumours, CPS remained indeterminate (11%). At the MSI 
characterisation, the majority of the population was MSS (80%; it was indeterminate in 19.1%). Overall, 
the study population can be considered representative of the whole target population.  
Pembrolizumab, in addition to gemcitabine+cisplatin, provided advantage compared to 
gemcitabine+cisplatin alone on the primary endpoint OS (HR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.72; 0.95; p=0.0034), 
with a gain in median survival of 1.8 months (12.7 vs 10.9). These results are similar to the magnitude of 
effect that was reported for durvalumab on top of gemcitabine+cisplatin in the TOPAZ-1 trial (HR= 0.80; 
95% CI: 0.66, 0.97; p-value 0.021; median OS gain ~1.5 months) (see Imfinzi SmPC). 
The secondary endpoint PFS did not meet statistically significance. It showed a trend towards 
improvement in the experimental vs the control arm (HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.75,1; p=0.0225) at IA1, that 
was confirmed at the FA (HR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.99; p=0.0171). The ORR was unchanged by 
pembrolizumab treatment (28.7% vs 28.5% in the pembrolizumab and placebo arm, respectively at IA1; 
29.3% vs 28.4% in the pembrolizumab and placebo arm, respectively at FA), although a slightly longer 
duration of response was registered in the experimental arm compared to control (9.7 vs 6.9 months at 
IA1; 8.3 vs 6.8 months at FA).   
Among exploratory endpoints, PROs were comparable between arms.  
Subgroup analysis demonstrated consistency across the main prespecified subgroups, with the 
exception of a lower performance of pembrolizumab in OS for the gallbladder (HR=0.96; 95% CI:0.73, 
1.26) and extrahepatic (HR=0.99; 95% CI:0.73,1.35) tumour, compared to the intrahepatic cancer 
(HR=0.76; 95% CI:0.64,0.91). A similar behaviour was reported for durvalumab in the TOPAZ-1 trial. 
The PFS and ORR followed the same trend, with the PFS reaching a HR>1 in the extrahepatic localisation, 
and ORR showing even disadvantage of pembrolizumab vs placebo in the extrahepatic and gallbladder 
cancer sites. Due to the availability of limited clinical data and poor knowledge around peculiarities in 
biological/clinical features that might impact response to immunomodulators, no firm conclusions can be 
derived on the reasons and biological plausibility underlying inconsistency in treatment effect across 
tumour locations. Considering the absence of a detrimental effect in these subgroups on the basis of the 
survival primary endpoint, it can be concluded that a positive B/R of pembrolizumab in association to 
chemotherapy applies regardless of anatomical classification. 
The efficacy evaluation by CPS score, either by using 1 or 10 as cut-off point, demonstrated similar 
results in the different subgroups regardless of the PD-L1 status. 
OS and PFS were consistent in Asians and non-Asians, although ORR was enhanced by pembrolizumab 
in Asians (difference between pembrolizumab and placebo of 4) but reduced by treatment in non-Asians 
(difference between pembrolizumab and placebo of -3). The TOPAZ-1 trial reported increased efficacy of 
durvalumab in countries known to be fluke-endemic compared to the ITT population. This pattern was not 
replicated in KEYNOTE-966, where response to treatment was even more attenuated in this 
geographically determined subgroup (HR=0.92; 95% CI: 0.72;1.17) compared to the overall population, 
though not indicative of a clear detrimental effect. The OS by hepatitis status was generally consistent 
with the treatment performance registered in the overall population.  
Efficacy by age was generally comparable in the different patient categories, in terms of OS and PFS. 
However, the ORR was reduced by pembrolizumab relative to placebo in patients aged ≥75 years 
compared to the youngest population (9.0 vs 9.4 for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus 
Assessment report

chemotherapy, respectively). No clear signs of detrimental effect emerged in the oldest. In any case, a 
warning for the use of pembrolizumab in the elderly population, particularly in combination with 
chemotherapy, is already included in the SmPC as a general consideration, which also applies to the 
current clinical setting (see SmPC section 4.4).  
There were no substantial differences in the list of subsequent therapies between groups, since 
cytotoxic agents were equally received by patients (43.2% vs 42.9% in the pembrolizumab vs placebo 
arm) with a prevailing use of the FOLFOX regimen (>20% in both arms); as expected, a slightly more 
frequent administration of checkpoint inhibitors was reported in the placebo arm (7.1% vs 4.9% in the 
pembrolizumab arm). The use of localised therapy after disease progression was very limited in the study 
population (0.2-1.1%), overall balanced between treatment arms. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the efficacy evaluation supported a modest survival advantage of pembrolizumab versus placebo 
on top of gemcitabicine plus cisplatin in the first-line treatment of the advanced BTC disease setting. The 
final indication wording was updated to clearly reflect that the backbone therapy used was gemcitabine 
plus cisplatin. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
KEYNOTE-966 is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy versus placebo plus chemotherapy in participants with locally advanced unresectable or 
metastatic biliary tract carcinoma. Safety analyses used the All Participants as Treated (APaT) population 
of all participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention, as of the FA DCO date of 15-DEC-
2022. Pooled safety data from studies of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in NSCLC 
(KEYNOTE-021 Cohorts A, C, and G, KEYNOTE-189, and KEYNOTE-407), HNSCC (KEYNOTE-048), TNBC 
(KEYNOTE-355), and esophageal carcinoma (KEYNOTE-590) are included to provide a point of reference 
on the safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy. Participants in the Pooled 
Combination Dataset received pembrolizumab along with one or more chemotherapeutic agents. These 
chemotherapies included platinum-based chemotherapy, 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel, 
gemcitabine, and pemetrexed. The safety results are presented for the following 4 datasets (see table

Every participant is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
 A specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets 
the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding. 
 A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or 
more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding. 
 Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last 
dose are included. 
 MedDRA preferred terms "Neoplasm Progression", "Malignant Neoplasm Progression" and "Disease 
Progression" not related to the drug are excluded.

Deaths due to drug-related AEs were reported in 1.5% of the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group and 0.6% of the placebo plus chemotherapy group; no drug-related AEs resulting in death were 
reported in more than 1 participant. In KEYNOTE-966, a total of 8 participants died of a drug-related AE, 
as assessed by the investigator, in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group. Of the 8 deaths in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group considered by the investigator as related to the study 
intervention, 5 were considered related to chemotherapy (cholangitis, lower respiratory tract infection,

The proportion of participants with 1 or more drug-related SAEs was generally similar in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group compared with the placebo plus chemotherapy group (22.9% 
vs 15.7%). The most frequently reported drug related SAEs (incidence ≥1%) were platelet count 
decreased, neutrophil count decreased, pyrexia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonitis in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, and platelet count decreased and febrile neutropenia in the

was 3.32 events/100 person-months in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, 4.20 events/100 
person-months in the Pooled Combination Dataset, and 4.55 events/100 person-months in the RSD. 
For 14.9% of participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group in KEYNOTE-966, the 
maximum grade of AEOSI was Grade 1 or 2; for 7.2% of participants, the maximum Grade was 3 to 5. 
There was 1 fatal AEOSI (pneumonitis) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group considered 
related to both chemotherapy (gemcitabine) and pembrolizumab by the investigator (data not shown).  
The AEOSI outcome was reported as resolved or resolving for 37.6% and 18.8% of participants, 
respectively, in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group of KEYNOTE-966 at the time of data cutoff. 
The most frequently reported AEOSI categories in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group were 
hypothyroidism (8.7%), pneumonitis (4.9%), and hyperthyroidism (3.6%). The proportion of participants 
with an event in the AEOSI category of hepatitis in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group was 
(1.7%) compared with the Pooled Combination Dataset (1.2%) and the RSD (1.0%). There were no 
reported events of cholangitis sclerosing, autoimmune cholangitis, or immune-mediated cholangitis in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group in KEYNOTE-966 (data not shown).

Table 57 Adverse Event Summary for AEOSI (APaT Population) 
Hepatic Events of Clinical Interest (HECI):  
Patients with BTC are at risk for a range of complications that can cause hepatic laboratory abnormalities 
with or without clinical decompensation. For careful monitoring of participants’ hepatic events of clinical 
interest (HECI) criteria were defined in the protocol and used by the investigators for assessment and 
reporting of events meeting these criteria. In KEYNOTE-966, the median time to onset of the first HECI 
was 88.0 days (range 3 to 711 days) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 146.0 (range 2 
to 579 days) in the placebo plus chemotherapy group.  
With regard to pre-existing viral hepatitis, KEYNOTE-966 allowed enrollment of participants with 
preexisting HBV/HCV, and these participants were monitored during the course of the study. No cases of 
viral hepatitis flares were observed.

Every participant is counted once according to the worst outcome; the ordering of the outcome is as 
follows: Fatal>Not Resolved>Resolving>Unknown>Sequelae>Resolved. 
 "Participants in population" is used for percentage calculation for the Overall row in each section. 
Within each section, the overall total is used for percentage calculation for each outcome. 
 Outcome: Resolved = RECOVERED/RESOLVED, Resolving = RECOVERING/RESOLVING, Sequelae = 
RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE, Not resolved = NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED.

Laboratory findings 
No new safety concerns based on laboratory abnormalities were reported in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group in KEYNOTE-966. The proportion of participants with abnormal laboratory findings 
were comparable in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus chemotherapy group, and 
higher than the RSD, reflecting chemotherapy-related toxicities and the study indication. There were no 
notable differences in laboratory abnormalities between the treatment groups in KEYNOTE-966 (tables 
not shown). Laboratory abnormalities (by maximum toxicity grade worsened from baseline) in the 
KEYNOTE-966 pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus the RSD (≥20% difference) included ALT 
increased, AST increased, bilirubin increased, calcium decreased, creatinine increased, GGT increased, 
sodium decreased, hypomagnesemia, white blood cell count decreased, lymphocyte count decreased, 
neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, hemoglobin decreased (anemia). The laboratory 
abnormalities listed above were primarily CTCAE Grade 1 and Grade 2 in severity. The most frequently 
observed (≥10%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities that were similar in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy and placebo plus chemotherapy groups were consistent with chemotherapy-related 
myelosuppression (WBC decreased, hemoglobin decreased, platelet count decreased, lymphocyte count 
decreased, neutrophil count decreased), or underlying advanced BTC (blood bilirubin increased) (tables 
not shown). 
Safety in special populations 
Age

Sex. The AE profile in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group in KEYNOTE-966 was generally 
similar between male and female participants (tables not shown). The AE profile was similar for both 
sexes in the Pooled Combination Dataset (with the exception of SAEs, which were more common in 
males) and the RSD (data not shown).

ECOG Status. The AE profile in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group in KEYNOTE-966 was 
generally similar between participants with an ECOG status of 0 and participants with an ECOG status of 
1, except for a higher incidence of all causality SAEs in participants with an ECOG status of 1 (data not 
shown). 
The same pattern (higher incidence of all causality SAEs in participants with an ECOG status of 1 vs 0) 
was generally observed in the Pooled Combination Dataset and the RSD. Additionally, the incidence of 
drug-related SAEs was higher in participants with ECOG status of 1 vs 0 in the Pooled Combination 
Dataset, the incidence of Grade 3 to 5 all causality AEs was higher in participants with ECOG status of 1 
vs 0 in the RSD, and the incidence of drug-related AEs was higher in participants with ECOG status of 0 
vs 1 in the RSD. 
Region. The AE profile based on region in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group in KEYNOTE-966 
was generally consistent with both the Pooled Combination Dataset and the RSD. No notable differences 
in AE profile were observed between North America, Western Europe, and the rest of the world (data not 
shown).  
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation. There were no reports of pregnancy in KEYNOTE-966. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food 
and drug-drug interaction (DDI) are not anticipated to influence exposure.  
Drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 enzymes, and other metabolizing enzymes, are not expected to 
interfere with the metabolism of an IgG antibody. The IgG antibodies, in general, do not directly regulate 
the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, other enzymes, or transporters involved in drug 
elimination. Therefore, no dedicated DDI studies have been performed. In addition, in vitro experiments 
and studies conducted in preclinical species have been shown to have limited value in predicting DDI 
potential in humans. Therefore, no preclinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to assess the 
propensity of pembrolizumab to be a victim or perpetrator of pharmacokinetic DDIs. Similarly, the 
potential of DDI between pembrolizumab and chemotherapy agents is expected to be low. No impact of 
co-administered chemotherapy on pembrolizumab PK was observed in KEYNOTE-021 cohort G. Studies 
evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. However, 
as systemic corticosteroids may be used in combination with pembrolizumab to ameliorate potential side 
effects, the potential for a pharmacokinetic DDI with pembrolizumab as a victim was assessed as part of 
the population pharmacokinetic analysis (data not shown). No relationship was observed between 
prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and pembrolizumab exposure. Nevertheless, the use of 
systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants before the start of pembrolizumab treatment 
should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy 
of pembrolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after 
starting pembrolizumab treatment to treat immune-mediated adverse reactions. Corticosteroids can also 
be used as premedication, when pembrolizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy, as antiemetic 
prophylaxis and/or to alleviate chemotherapy-related adverse reactions (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In KEYNOTE-966, the proportion of participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group who 
experienced 1 or more AEs that led to discontinuation of any study treatment was generally similar 
compared with the placebo plus chemotherapy group (26.1% vs 22.8% (see Table 49), exposure 
adjusted 3.43 vs 3.18 (see Table 50)). The incidence of specific AEs was similar between both treatment

groups in KEYNOTE-966 (see Table 51). The proportion of participants discontinuing any study treatment 
due to cholangitis was low in both the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus chemotherapy 
groups (0.4% and 0.6%, respectively) (data not shown). 
The proportion of participants with AEs leading to discontinuations of any study treatment in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (26.1%) was similar to the Pooled Combination Dataset 
(27.1%) and higher compared with the RSD (14.0%) (see Table 49); differences between the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and the RSD were driven partly by chemotherapy-related 
toxicities (neutrophil count decreased and platelet count decreased) (data not shown).  
A similar percentage of participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus 
chemotherapy groups in KEYNOTE-966 experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of chemotherapy 
(23.4% and 21.2%, respectively). These percentages were also similar to the percentage of participants 
with AEs leading to discontinuation of chemotherapy in the Pooled Combination Dataset (20.9%) (see 
Table 49). 
Discontinuation of pembrolizumab/placebo due to AEs occurred in a similar proportion of participants in 
the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus chemotherapy groups (14.6% vs 12.4%). These 
percentages were also generally consistent with the Pooled Combination Dataset (17.0%) and the RSD 
(14.0%), with no clinically meaningful differences in AEs between the groups and indicate no new safety 
concern for pembrolizumab (see Table 49). 
In KEYNOTE-966, the proportion of participants with drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of any 
study treatment was generally similar in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group compared with the 
placebo plus chemotherapy group (19.3% vs 15.2%) (see Table 49). The most frequently reported AEs 
(≥1% incidence) leading to discontinuation of any study treatment in both treatment groups were 
neutrophil count decreased, and blood creatinine increased (data not shown). 
The proportion of participants with drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of any study treatment in 
the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (19.3%) was similar to the Pooled Combination Dataset 
(21.3%) and higher compared with the RSD (8.4%) (see Table 49). Differences in the pembrolizumab 
plus chemotherapy group compared with the RSD were partly driven by higher incidences of 
chemotherapy-associated AEs (e.g., neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased) (data not 
shown). 
In KEYNOTE-966, the proportion of participants with drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of 
pembrolizumab/placebo was generally similar in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus 
chemotherapy groups (8.9% vs 4.9%) (see Table 49). The most frequently reported drug-related AEs 
(≥2 participants) leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group were pneumonitis, platelet count decreased, enterocolitis, pulmonary embolism, immune-mediated 
hepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis (data not shown).  
The proportion of participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group with drug-related AEs 
leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab (8.9%) was similar to those in the both the Pooled 
Combination Dataset (11.5%) and the RSD (8.4%) (see Table 49).  
Participant narratives for participants in pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group with drug-related AEs 
leading to discontinuation of intervention are provided in the CSR (data not shown). The proportion of 
participants who experienced 1 or more AEs that led to interruption of any study treatment was similar in 
the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group compared with the placebo plus chemotherapy group 
(70.5% vs 70.6%). The most frequently reported AEs (≥5%) in both groups were neutrophil count 
decreased, platelet count decreased, WBC count decreased, and anemia, reflecting common 
chemotherapy-related toxicities (data not shown).

The proportion of participants with AEs leading to interruption of any study treatment in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (70.5%) was similar to the Pooled Combination Dataset 
(64.5%) and higher compared with the RSD (26.1%) (data not shown).  
The proportion of participants with AEs resulting in treatment interruptions of pembrolizumab/placebo 
was similar in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus chemotherapy groups (55.0% vs 
58.1%). The most frequently reported AEs (≥5% incidence) leading to pembrolizumab/placebo 
interruptions included neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, and anemia, consistent with 
common chemotherapy-related toxicities (data not shown).  
The proportion of participants with treatment interruptions of pembrolizumab due to AEs in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (55.0%) was similar to the Pooled Combination Dataset 
(54.9%) and higher compared with the RSD (26.1%). Differences between the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group and the RSD were partly driven by higher incidences of chemotherapy-associated 
AEs (neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, and anemia) (data not shown). 
The proportion of participants with drug-related AEs leading to interruption of any study treatment was 
similar in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group compared with the placebo plus chemotherapy 
group (56.9% vs 57.1%). The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (≥5%) in both groups were 
neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, WBC count decreased, and anemia, reflecting 
common chemotherapy-related toxicities. The proportion of participants with drug-related AEs leading to 
interruption of any study treatment in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group was also similar to 
that observed in the Pooled Combination Dataset (54.5%) (data not shown).  
The proportion of participants with treatment interruption due to drug-related AEs was higher in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group compared with the RSD (56.9% vs 14.7%). Differences were 
partly driven by higher incidences of chemotherapy-associated AEs (neutrophil count decreased, platelet 
count decreased, WBC count decreased, and anemia) (data not shown). 
The proportion of participants with treatment interruptions of pembrolizumab/placebo were similar in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus chemotherapy groups (38.6% vs 40.6%). The most 
frequently reported drug-related AEs (≥5% incidence) in these groups included neutrophil count 
decreased, platelet count decreased, and anemia, consistent with common chemotherapy-related 
toxicities (data not shown). 
The proportion of participants with treatment interruptions of pembrolizumab due to drug-related AEs was 
higher in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group compared with the RSD (38.6% vs 14.7%) (data

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine in adult patients with 
locally advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancers has been assessed in the phase 3 
randomized, placebo-controlled KEYNOTE-966 clinical trial. The safety analysis was presented as 
comparative of chemotherapy vs chemotherapy plus immunotherapy in the context of KEYNOTE-966. At 
data cut-off of 15-DEC-2022 (final analysis (FA)), all participants who received at least 1 dose of study 
intervention were included in the safety analysis (n=529 in the interventional arm; n=534 in the control 
arm). Additionally, the MAH provided safety data from the reference datasets of previous studies with 
pembrolizumab used as a single agent (n=7 631) or in combination with chemotherapy (n=2 033).  
The KEYNOTE-966 trial population resulted enriched in subjects of Asian race (45.9% in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 46.6% in the placebo plus chemotherapy group) as 
compared with the reference datasets of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy and immunotherapy alone 
(10.8 and23.2%, respectively). Such a difference is in part justified by the study indication, given the 
epidemiology of cholangiocarcinoma. The population was well balanced according to age, ECOG 
performance status and gender.  
Exposure to the study drugs was similar in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy 
plus placebo arms (median 6.37 vs 5.54 months), as it was for the mean number of administrations 
(20.35 vs 18.89 administrations). The slightly longer exposure in the pembrolizumab arm is likely a result 
of the longer progression-free survival.   
The proportion of AEs reported in the two arms was comparable. However, treatment-related serious AEs 
were higher in subjects receiving pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy than chemotherapy alone (22.9% vs 
15.7%). In addition, pruritus, rash and pyrexia were more common in patients receiving pembrolizumab; 
however, the incidence of these AEs was not higher than observed in the pooled datasets of 
pembrolizumab alone or in combination with various chemotherapies. Rash and pruritus have been 
associated with pembrolizumab. The differences in the safety profile between chemotherapy plus 
pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab alone were commonly ascribed to the chemo-related haematological 
toxicity, such as neutrophil count decreased, anaemia, platelet count decreased, nausea, white blood cell 
count (WBC) decreased, vomiting, constipation.  
A higher proportion of participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group experienced AEs of 
ALT increased and AST increased compared with the RSD, that could be associated with the study 
indication BTC. However, the frequency of ALT and AST increased was higher in the control arm of 
KEYNOTE-966 study.  
A higher proportion of participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group had Grade 3 to 4 
AEs compared with the RSD, possibly due to chemotherapy and underlying malignancy in the KEYNOTE-
966.  
Overall, the proportion of participants in KEYNOTE-966 who experienced 1 or more drug-related AEs 
was similar between the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and the placebo plus chemotherapy groups 
(93.2% vs 93.6%). The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (incidence ≥10%) were similar 
between the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus chemotherapy groups. Consistently 
with the analysis of all AEs, pruritus, rash and hypothyroidism were more common in patients treated 
with pembrolizumab than placebo. The proportion of participants with drug-related AEs in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (93.2%) was similar to the Pooled Combination Dataset 
Assessment report  
EMA/534959/2023 
Page 95/104 
 
 
 
 
(95.8%) and higher than in the RSD (71.6%). Common drug-related AEs in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group included common chemotherapy-related toxicities of neutrophil count decreased, 
anemia, platelet count decreased, nausea, WBC decreased, fatigue, decreased appetite, vomiting, 
constipation, and rash. 
Grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurred in a comparable proportion in the two study arms (85.3% vs 
84.1%). The most frequently reported Grade 3 to 5 AEs (incidence ≥5%) in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group were neutrophil count decreased, anaemia, platelet count decreased, WBC count 
decreased, and cholangitis. The proportion of participants with 1 or more drug-related SAEs was higher in 
the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group compared with the placebo plus chemotherapy group 
(22.9% vs 15.7%). The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs (incidence ≥1%) were platelet count 
decreased, neutrophil count decreased, pyrexia, anaemia, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonitis in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, and platelet count decreased and febrile neutropenia in the 
placebo plus chemotherapy group. No meaningful differences in the frequency of specific drug-related 
SAEs were observed between the treatment groups.  Also, when compared with the reference pooled 
dataset of pembrolizumab, with or without chemotherapy, cholangitis emerged as a more common event 
in KEYNOTE-966; however, such a difference can still be interpreted based on the study indication, that is 
biliary cancers. 
Fatal events occurred in 5.9% and 9.2% of subjects enrolled in the pembrolizumab and placebo arm, 
respectively. The most frequently reported AEs resulting in death (>2 participants) in KEYNOTE-966 were 
pneumonia (0.8%), death (0.6%), and sepsis (0.6%) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, 
and sepsis (1.1%), death (0.9%), COVID-19 (0.7%), cerebral infarction (0.6%), and pulmonary 
embolism (0.6%) in the placebo plus chemotherapy group. Deaths due to drug-related AEs were reported 
in 1.5% of the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 0.6% of the placebo plus chemotherapy 
group.   
Clarifications were requested to the MAH on the event reported as “death” in the control arm, as it was 
unclear if this was a case of thyroiditis in a patient with pre-existing risk of fatal arrythmia, not managed 
in the proper way. The additional data provided however did not allow to conclude on a reasonable 
possibility of a causality between pembrolizumab and the event of death given the underlying 
cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities, reported sudden onset of the event, and a lack of an 
autopsy report.  
Additional clarification regarding the event of death due to “viral pneumonia”, based on the available data 
including fever, neutropenia, lymphopenia and CT imaging finding, it was agreed with the MAH that likely 
the event was secondary to an infectious process in the setting of underlying malignancy and 
administration of chemotherapy. 
No new indication-specific AEOSI causally associated with pembrolizumab were identified in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group in KEYNOTE-966.The frequency, severity, and types of AEOSI 
observed in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group were generally consistent with pembrolizumab 
used as a single agent. The overall incidence of AEOSI was similar in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group (22.1%) compared with Pooled Combination Dataset (28.8%) and the RSD 
(26.8%), and higher than chemotherapy alone (12.9%). There was 1 fatal AEOSI (pneumonitis) in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group considered related to both chemotherapy (gemcitabine) and 
pembrolizumab by the investigator. Pneumonitis is a well-known adverse drug reaction of 
pembrolizumab, and the risk of fatal events of pneumonitis is already included in the SmPC. The 
proportion of participants with an event in the AEOSI category of hepatitis was similar in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (1.7%) compared with the Pooled Combination Dataset (1.2%) 
and the RSD (1.0%). Overall, there were no data suggesting any new safety concerns for known 
pembrolizumab AEOSI when combining pembrolizumab with chemotherapy.

In KEYNOTE-966, the proportion of participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group who 
experienced 1 or more AEs that led to discontinuation of any study treatment was generally similar 
compared with the placebo plus chemotherapy group (26.1% vs 22.8%). 
Safety in special populations was described. The safety findings in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group of KEYNOTE-966 based on age, sex, or ECOG performance status were generally 
consistent with the established safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy and the known safety profile 
of chemotherapy.  
Age: The AE profile based on age in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group was generally 
consistent with the RSD. The AE profile in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group was generally 
similar between participants who were <65 years and those ≥65 years with the exception of Grade 3 to 5 
drug-related AEs, SAEs, and pembrolizumab dose modifications, which were more frequent in participants 
≥65 years of age. A similar pattern was observed between the age groups in the Pooled Combination 
Dataset (with the exception of Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AEs) and the RSD.  
The AE profile between age categories <65 years, 65 to 74 years, and ≥75 years was generally similar in 
the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, with the exception of SAEs (all causality and drug-related), 
deaths due to AEs, chemotherapy dose modifications, and discontinuations due to AEs, which were more 
frequent in participants ≥75 years of age compared with those <65 years or 65 to 74 years. The 
summary of AEs by age groups (<65, 65 to 74, and ≥75 years) in the results section shows that the 
proportion of participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group who experienced AEs related to 
falling and cardiovascular events were generally comparable across age groups. Infections, 
cerebrovascular events, and central nervous system events were more frequent in the ≥75-year age 
group. Due to the relatively small number of participants in the ≥75-year age group, these results should 
be interpreted with caution. 
Sex: The overall safety profile was similar in male and female individuals, with higher frequency of SAE 
reported in males.  
ECOG status: Similarly, safety was comparable in ECOG 0 vs 1, with higher rates of SAEs in ECOG 1, 
which might be expected.  
Region: No remarkable differences were reported across geographical regions. 
Hepatic events of clinical interest (HECI) were specifically analysed in KEYNOTE-966, given the risk 
of hepatic events in patients with BTC. Reassuringly, in KEYNOTE-966, the rate of HECI was generally 
similar in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus chemotherapy groups (9.3% vs 
10.7%); further, there were no reported events of AEOSI such as cholangitis sclerosing, autoimmune 
cholangitis, or immune-mediated cholangitis in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, and no 
cases of viral hepatitis flare were observed. The majority of HECI events were of CTCAE Grade 1 to 2 
toxicity. The proportion of participants with Grade 3 to 5 HECI were similar in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group (9.1%) and the placebo plus chemotherapy (9.7%). Most HECI were resolved or 
resolving in both intervention groups. The median time to onset of the first HECI was 88.0 days (range 3 
to 711 days) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 146.0 (range 2 to 579 days) in the 
placebo plus chemotherapy group.  
Nevertheless, the MAH was requested to further investigate the relation of hepatic events with biliary 
stent in view of the previous findings of TOPAZ-1 study and the corresponding warning in the SmPC for 
Imfinzi. The additional data provided showed that cholangitis and biliary infections are commonly and 
expectedly increased in the presence of a biliary drainage. The MAH reported that such an increase is 3 to 
4-fold than in the lack of any drainage. While limited by the low number of patients in this subgroup 
analysis is acknowledged, still the risk of biliary complications appears higher when patients have a biliary 
drainage in the pembrolizumab rather than in the control arm (39% vs 29%) (see Table 63). In addition, 
Assessment report

Page 97/104 
 
 
 
 
the consistency with a very similar study may reinforce the finding. A warning has been included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect the findings over the rate of biliary complications in patients with biliary 
stent and drains. 
The MAH reported the rate of AEs separately for subjects with liver metastasis at the study enrolment. 
There is no increase of the liver specific AEs, including AEOSI or severe events.  
The AEs leading to treatment interruption in the KEYNOTE-966 are consistent with the established 
safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy, chemotherapy and/or underlying BTC. The incremental 
toxicity when compared with RSD is expected when adding chemotherapy to pembrolizumab. 
The drug-related AEs leading to treatment interruption in the KEYNOTE-966 treatment groups are 
consistent with the established safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy and the known safety profile 
of chemotherapy. The incremental toxicity when compared with the RSD is expected when adding 
chemotherapy to pembrolizumab. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine for the first-line 
treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma in adults in KEYNOTE-

3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The final indication is: KEYTRUDA, in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin, is indicated for the first-
line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma in adults.  
The BTC comprises a heterogeneous group of malignancies affecting the biliary tree that are distinguished 
based on the anatomical localisation (gallbladder, intrahepatic, perihilar, and distal/periampullary). Given 
the rare frequency of these tumours, the different subtypes are generally pooled together although 
carrying different epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, molecular features, and prognosis 
(Manne et al, 2021)8.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Chemotherapy has long been the SoC for first-line treatment of advanced BTC, and the cisplatin – 
gemcitabine doublet is the most common therapy adopted in the advanced stage of cancer. On 16 
December 2022, durvalumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin was approved for the 
treatment of BTC based on a modest survival advantage compared to chemotherapy alone as observed in 
the TOPAZ-1 study (EMEA/H/C/004771/II/0046). This combination is recommended as first-line 
treatment of advanced BTC (ESMO 2023). However, prognosis remains extremely poor with a median OS 
below 1 year in treated patients (Valle et al., 2010)9, which makes the BTC a condition of significant 
unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current procedure is supported by one single pivotal phase III double-blind randomized KEYNOTE-
966 study comparing the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine plus 
cisplatin to placebo in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
• 
Pembrolizumab, in addition to gemcitabine plus cisplatin, provided advantage compared to placebo in 
addition to gemcitabine plus cisplatin on the primary endpoint OS (HR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.95; 
p=0.0034), with a gain in median survival of 1.8 months (12.7 vs 10.9). 
•  Subgroup analysis demonstrated consistency across most of the prespecified subgroups: age, 
geographic region, locally advanced vs metastatic, ECOG PS, biliary stent/biliary drain, antibiotics 
within 1 month of study start, smoking status, prior chemotherapy, PD-L1 expression (CPS>=1 vs 
<1), PD-L1 expression (CPS <10 vs >=10), MSS, hepatitis B status, subsequent therapies. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
The survival gain exerted by pembrolizumab over placebo was modest, with a 1.8 month increase in 
median OS compared to placebo.  
• 
PFS did not meet statistical significance, although it showed a trend towards improvement in the 
experimental vs the control arm (HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.75, 1; p=0.0225) at IA1 that was confirmed 
at the FA (HR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.99; p=0.0171).  
• 
It was observed a lower performance of pembrolizumab in OS for the gallbladder (HR=0.96; 95% CI: 
0.73, 1.26) and extrahepatic (HR=0.99; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.35) tumour, compared to the intrahepatic 
cancer (HR=0.76; 95% CI:0.64,0.91). Due to the availability of limited clinical data and poor 
knowledge, no firm conclusions can be derived on the reasons and biological plausibility underlying 
inconsistency in treatment effect across tumour locations. Considering the absence of a detrimental 
effect in these subgroups, it can be concluded that a positive B/R of pembrolizumab in association to 
chemotherapy applies regardless of anatomical classification. 
• 
The screen failure rate was higher than expected, mostly associated with inappropriate organ 
function as defined by the inclusion criteria. This questions the external representativeness of the 
study for the target population. The main reason for screen failure was concomitant disease-

associated liver dysfunction at baseline. Although gemcitabine administration is not contraindicated 
in patients with liver dysfunction, it needs to be carefully monitored due to the anticipated liver 
toxicity. In order to inform the treating physicians, a statement including the specifications for liver 
function of patients enrolled in KEYNOTE-966 has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
• 
Treatment-related serious AEs were higher in subjects receiving pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
compared to chemotherapy alone (22.9% vs 15.7%). Pruritus, rash and pyrexia were more common 
in patients receiving pembrolizumab. 
•  Grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurred in a comparable proportion in the two study arms (85.3% vs 
84.1%). The most frequently reported Grade 3 to 5 AEs (incidence ≥5%) in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group were neutrophil count decreased, anaemia, platelet count decreased, WBC 
count decreased, and cholangitis. 
•  Deaths due to drug-related AEs were reported in 1.5% of the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group and 0.6% of the placebo plus chemotherapy group. 
• 
The proportion of participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group who experienced 1 or 
more AEs that led to discontinuation of any study treatment was generally similar compared with the 
placebo plus chemotherapy group (26.1% vs 22.8%). 
• 
The frequency, severity, and types of AEOSI observed in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group were generally consistent with pembrolizumab used as a single agent. 
• 
Patients aged 65-year or older experienced more drug-related AEs and SAEs, resulting in a higher 
proportion of treatment discontinuations. 
• 
The rate of HECI was generally similar in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and placebo plus 
chemotherapy groups (9.3% vs 10.7%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
• 
The assessment of safety in patients aged ≥75 years is hampered by the low number of patients in 
this age group (68 vs 57). In the SmPC, a general warning that pembrolizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy should be used with caution in patients ≥75 years after careful consideration of the 
potential benefit/risk on an individual basis is already included (see SmPC 5.1).  
•  With the addition of pembrolizumab, the rate of hepatic events (cholangitis and biliary infections) 
furtherly increased in patients with biliary stents/drainage (39% vs 29%). A warning to closely 
monitor patients with biliary stents/drainage has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Pembrolizumab, as add-on therapy to gemcitabine+cisplatin for the first-line treatment of locally 
advanced unresectable or metastatic BTC, provided advantage in OS compared to gemcitabine+cisplatin 
alone (HR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.72,0.95; p=0.0034). However, only a modest effect in terms of gain in 
median survival was obtained (i.e. 1.8 months; 12.7 vs 10.9). This finding is similar to what was 
observed with drugs of the same class in the same setting (durvalumab plus gemcitabine+cisplatin in the 
TOPAZ-1 trial). The secondary endpoint PFS showed a trend towards improvement in the experimental 
arm relative to control that did not meet statistical significance (HR=0.86; 95% CI:0.75,1; p=0.0225) at 
IA1, that was confirmed at the FA (HR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.99; p=0.0171). The ORR was unchanged 
by pembrolizumab treatment (28.7% vs 28.5% in the pembrolizumab and placebo arm, respectively at 
IA1; 29.3% vs 28.4% in the pembrolizumab and placebo arm, respectively at FA), although a slightly 
longer duration of response was achieved in the experimental arm compared to control (9.7 vs 6.9 
months at IA1; 8.3 vs 6.8 months at FA). The pre-specified subgroup analysis showed a lower 
performance of pembrolizumab in OS for the gallbladder (HR=0.96; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.26) and 
extrahepatic (HR=0.99; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.35) tumours, compared to the intrahepatic subtype (HR=0.76; 
95% CI: 0.64, 0.91). The PFS and ORR followed the same trend, with PFS reaching a HR>1 in the 
extrahepatic localisation, and ORR showing even disadvantage of pembrolizumab vs placebo in the 
extrahepatic and gallbladder cancer sites. However, considering the limited value of subgroup analyses 
and the absence of a detrimental effect in these subgroups based on OS data, it can be concluded that a 
favourable effect of pembrolizumab in association to chemotherapy applies regardless of primary tumour 
location.

Overall, the safety profile of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-966 study is consistent with the established 
toxicity of pembrolizumab monotherapy, the chemotherapy doublet and the underlying BTC disease. No 
new safety concerns were identified.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit/risk ratio of pembrolizumab, as add-on therapy to gemcitabine+cisplatin for the first-line 
treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic BTC, is considered positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit risk balance 
None. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of KEYTRUDA is positive as add-on therapy to gemcitabine+cisplatin for the first-line 
treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic BTC.  
4.  Recommendations

final results from study KEYNOTE-966; this is a Phase 3 randomized, double blind study of 
Pembrolizumab plus Gemcitabine/Cisplatin versus Placebo plus Gemcitabine/Cisplatin as first-line therapy 
in participants with advanced and/or unresectable biliary tract carcinoma. As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version

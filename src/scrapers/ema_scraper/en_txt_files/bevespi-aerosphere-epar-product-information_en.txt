1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Bevespi Aerosphere 7.2 micrograms/5 micrograms pressurised inhalation, suspension
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each single actuation (delivered dose, the dose leaving the mouthpiece) contains glycopyrronium 
bromide 9 micrograms equivalent to 7.2 micrograms of glycopyrronium, and 5 micrograms of 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate.
This corresponds to a metered dose (i.e. the dose leaving the valve) of glycopyrronium bromide 
10.4 micrograms equivalent to 8.3 micrograms of glycopyrronium, and 5.8 microgram of formoterol 
fumarate dihydrate.
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Bevespi Aerosphere is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in 
adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (see section 5.1).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended dose is two inhalations twice daily (two inhalations in the morning and two 
inhalations in the evening).  
Patients should be advised not to take more than 2 inhalations twice daily.
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible and the next dose should be taken at the 
usual time. A double dose should not be taken to make up for a forgotten dose.
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustments are required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment
Bevespi Aerosphere can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate renal
impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, it
should be used only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment
2
Bevespi Aerosphere can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment. There are no relevant data on the use of Bevespi Aerosphere in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment and the medicinal product should be used with caution in these patients (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of Bevespi Aerosphere in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) for 
the indication of COPD. 
Method of administration 
For inhalation use.
Instructions for use
On actuation of Bevespi Aerosphere, a volume of the suspension is expelled from the pressurised 
container at high velocity. When the patient inhales through the mouthpiece at the same time as 
actuating the inhaler, the substance will follow the inspired air into the airways. 
Note: Patients should be instructed on the correct inhalation technique. It is important to instruct the 
patient to: 

Carefully read the instructions for use in the package leaflet, which is packed together with each 
inhaler. 
Not use the inhaler if the drying agent, which is inside the foil pouch, has leaked out of its 
packet. 
Prime the inhaler by shaking it and actuating into the air four times before first use or two times 
when the inhaler has not been used for more than seven days, has been exposed to low
temperatures, or has been dropped.


To get adequate lung deposition of the active substances, actuation must be co-ordinated with 
inhalation. 
Patients who find it difficult to co-ordinate actuation with inspiration of breath may use Bevespi 
Aerosphere with a spacer to ensure proper administration of the product. Compatibility with the 
Aerochamber Plus Flow-Vu spacer device has been demonstrated (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Not for acute use
Bevespi Aerosphere is not indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm, i.e. as a 
rescue therapy.
Asthma
Bevespi Aerosphere should not be used to treat asthma. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm
As with other inhalation therapy, administration of this medicinal product may result in paradoxical 
bronchospasm, which can be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm does occur, treatment with 
the medicinal product should be stopped and other treatments considered.
3
Cardiovascular effects
Cardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, may be seen 
after the administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists and sympathomimetics, including 
glycopyrronium or formoterol. Patients with clinically significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease 
were excluded from clinical studies. Bevespi Aerosphere should be used with caution in patients with 
severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmias or severe heart 
failure.
Caution should also be exercised in patients with thyrotoxicosis or known or suspected prolongation of 
the QTc interval (see section 4.5).
Hypokalaemia
β2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia, which may increase the susceptibility to 
cardiac arrhythmias. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring 
supplementation. In patients with severe COPD, hypokalaemia may be potentiated by hypoxia and 
concomitant treatment (see section 4.5).
Hyperglycaemia
Inhalation of high doses of β2-adrenergic agonists may produce increases in plasma glucose.
Anticholinergic activity
Due to its anticholinergic activity, Bevespi Aerosphere should be used with caution in patients with 
symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia, urinary retention or with narrow-angle glaucoma (see section 4.8).
Patients with severe renal impairment
As glycopyrronium is predominantly renally excreted, patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance of < 30 mL/min), including those with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis,
should only be treated with Bevespi Aerosphere if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk
(see section 5.2).
Patients with severe hepatic impairment
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, Bevespi Aerosphere should be used only if the expected 
benefit outweighs the potential risk (see section 5.2). These patients should be monitored for potential 
adverse reactions.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pharmacokinetic interactions
No interaction studies have been performed with Bevespi Aerosphere; however, the potential for 
metabolic interactions is considered to be low based on in-vitro studies (see section 5.2).
Since glycopyrronium is eliminated mainly by the renal route, interactions could potentially occur 
with medicinal products affecting renal excretion mechanisms. In-vitro glycopyrronium is a substrate 
for the renal transporters OCT2 and MATE1/2K. The effect of cimetidine, a probe inhibitor of OCT2 
and MATE1, on inhaled glycopyrronium disposition showed a limited increase in its total systemic 
exposure (AUC0-t) by 22% and a slight decrease in renal clearance by 23% due to co-administration of 
cimetidine.
Pharmacodynamic interactions
4
Other antimuscarinics and sympathomimetics
Co-administration of Bevespi Aerosphere with other anticholinergic and/or long-acting β2-adrenergic 
agonist containing medicinal products has not been studied and is not recommended as it may 
potentiate known inhaled muscarinic antagonist or β2-adrenergic agonist adverse reactions (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.9).
Although no formal in-vivo interaction studies have been performed with Bevespi Aerosphere, studies 
indicate no clinical evidence of interactions when used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal 
products including short-acting β2-adrenergic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled 
steroids.
Drug-induced hypokalaemia
Concomitant treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non-potassium sparing diuretics 
may potentiate the possible initial hypokalaemic effect of β2-adrenergic agonists, therefore, caution is 
advised in their concomitant use (see section 4.4). 
β-adrenergic blockers
β-adrenergic blockers (including eye drops) can weaken or inhibit the effect of β2-adrenergic agonists, 
such as formoterol. Concurrent use of either non-selective or selective β-adrenergic blockers should be 
avoided unless there are compelling reasons for their use. If β-adrenergic blockers are required 
(including eye drops), cardioselective β-adrenergic blockers are preferred, although they should also 
be administered with caution.
Other pharmacodynamic interactions
Bevespi Aerosphere should be administered with caution to patients being treated with medicinal 
products known to prolong the QTc interval (see section 4.4). 
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data on the use of Bevespi Aerosphere in pregnant women.  
Single-dose studies in humans found that very small amounts of glycopyrronium passed the placental 
barrier. In animal studies, formoterol and glycopyrronium, individually, have caused adverse effects in 
reproduction studies at very high doses/systemic exposure levels (see section 5.3).
Bevespi Aerosphere should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefits outweigh the 
potential risks.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether glycopyrronium or formoterol are excreted in human milk. Evidence of 
transfer of glycopyrronium and formoterol into maternal milk in rats has been reported.
Administration of Bevespi Aerosphere to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if 
the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the infant (see section 5.3).
Fertility
Studies in rats have shown adverse effects on fertility only at dose levels higher than the maximum 
human exposure to formoterol (see section 5.3). Glycopyrronium did not cause any adverse effects on 
fertility in rats. It is unlikely that Bevespi Aerosphere administered at the recommended dose will 
affect fertility in humans.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
5
Bevespi Aerosphere has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However 
dizziness and nausea are common side effects which should be taken into account when driving or 
using machines. 
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The safety profile is characterised by anticholinergic and β2-adrenergic class effects related to
the individual components of the combination. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in 
patients receiving Bevespi Aerosphere were headache (1.9%), nausea (1.4%), muscle spasms (1.4%), 
and dizziness (1.3%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The tabulated list of adverse reactions is based on clinical trials and post-approval experience with 
Bevespi Aerosphere as well as experience with the individual components and related products. 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare 
(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

Common
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
An overdose of Bevespi Aerosphere may lead to exaggerated anticholinergic and/or β2-adrenergic 
signs and symptoms, the most frequent of which include blurred vision, dry mouth, nausea, muscle 
spasm, tremor, headache, palpitations and systolic hypertension.
If overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as 
necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics in combination with 
anticholinergics, ATC code: R03AL07.
Mechanism of action
Bevespi Aerosphere contains two bronchodilators: glycopyrronium, a long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist (also referred to as an anticholinergic), and formoterol, a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist
with a rapid onset of action. 
Glycopyrronium has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, 
it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of the M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading 
to bronchodilation. Formoterol causes direct relaxation of airway smooth muscle as a consequence of 
the increase in cyclic AMP through activation of adenylate cyclase. The combination of these 
substances with different mechanisms of action results in additive efficacy compared to use with either 
component alone. 
As a consequence of the differential density of muscarinic receptors and β2-adrenoceptors in the 
central and peripheral airways of the lung, muscarinic antagonists are more effective in relaxing 
central airways, and β2-adrenergic agonists are more effective in relaxing peripheral airways; 
relaxation of both central and peripheral airways with combination treatment may contribute to its 
beneficial effects on lung function. 
Pharmacodynamic effects
In three Phase III, 24-week studies (PINNACLE 1, PINNACLE 2 and PINNACLE 4) Bevespi 
Aerosphere provided improvements over placebo in lung function (as measured by morning pre-dose 
trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]), with a demonstrated onset of action at 5 minutes 
following administration of the first dose on Day 1 (improvement over placebo by 187 mL, 186 mL
7
and 179 mL in PINNACLE 1, PINNACLE 2 and PINNACLE 4, respectively [p <0.001]). The mean 
bronchodilator effect derived from serial FEV1 measurements at Day 1 and Week 12 from 
PINNACLE 1 are shown in Figure 1. In PINNACLE 2, the results were similar to those observed in 
PINNACLE 1.

WEEK 12
Cardiac electrophysiology
A placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin) thorough QT study in 69 healthy subjects did not 
demonstrate a clinically relevant effect on the QT interval, using a threshold of 10 ms. The largest 
8
mean (90% upper confidence bound) differences from placebo in baseline- and individually corrected 
QT was 3.1 (4.7) ms for Bevespi Aerosphere (14.4 /10 micrograms) and 7.6 (9.2) ms for
glycopyrronium/formoterol with eight times the recommended dose of glycopyrronium and four times 
the recommended dose of formoterol.
Clinical efficacy
The clinical development program for Bevespi Aerosphere included three 24-week, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pivotal Phase III studies in 5,433 patients with 
moderate to very severe COPD (PINNACLE 1, PINNACLE 2 and PINNACLE 4).
Effects on lung function
In studies PINNACLE 1, PINNACLE 2 and PINNACLE 4, Bevespi Aerosphere showed 
improvements in trough FEV1 over 24 weeks relative to placebo, glycopyrronium and formoterol 
(p<0.0001) [see Table 2]. There was no attenuation of the bronchodilator effect over time. Bevespi 
Aerosphere also showed improvements in peak FEV1 within 2 hours post-dose over 24 weeks relative 
to placebo, glycopyrronium and formoterol (p<0.0001) [see Table 2].
There were improvements in trough FEV1 irrespective of age, sex, degree of airflow limitation,
baseline symptoms, smoking status, or inhaled corticosteroid use.
Symptomatic outcomes
Breathlessness
In PINNACLE 1 and PINNACLE 2, Bevespi Aerosphere provided improvements in breathlessness as 
demonstrated by Self-administered Computerised Transitional Dyspnoea Index (SAC TDI) focal score 
over 24 weeks compared to placebo and glycopyrronium (see Table 2). Improvements compared to 
formoterol were observed in PINNACLE 2 (see Table 2). In PINNACLE 4, Bevespi Aerosphere 
provided improvements in breathlessness as demonstrated by TDI focal score over 24 weeks 
compared to placebo and glycopyrronium (see Table 2). 
Health-related quality of life
In PINNACLE 1, PINNACLE 2 and PINNACLE 4, Bevespi Aerosphere provided an improvement in 
disease-specific health-related quality of life, as indicated by a reduction in the St George’s 
Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score over 24 weeks compared to placebo and 
glycopyrronium (see Table 2). There were improvements compared to formoterol in PINNACLE 1 
and PINNACLE 2.

# A hierarchical statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison 
that did not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be
inferred.
COPD exacerbations
The individual studies were not specifically designed to evaluate the effect of treatments on COPD 
exacerbations and patients were withdrawn from the studies if a severe exacerbation or more than 2 
moderate exacerbations occurred.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Bevespi Aerosphere in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Following inhalation of the glycopyrronium and formoterol combination, the pharmacokinetics of 
each component was similar to those observed when each active substance was administered 
separately. For pharmacokinetic purposes, each component can therefore be considered separately.
Effect of a spacer
The use of Bevespi Aerosphere with the Aerochamber Plus Flow-Vu spacer in COPD patients 
increased the total systemic exposure to glycopyrronium (as measured by AUC0-12) by 16% while 
formoterol exposure was unchanged.
Absorption
Following inhaled administration of Bevespi Aerosphere in subjects with COPD, glycopyrronium Cmax
occurred at approximately 5 minutes, and formoterol Cmax occurred within 20 to 60 minutes. Steady 
state is achieved within 2-3 days of repeated dosing of Bevespi Aerosphere, and the extent of exposure 
is approximately 2.3 times and 1.5 times higher than after the first dose, for glycopyrronium and 
formoterol, respectively. 
A lung deposition study with Bevespi Aerosphere conducted in healthy volunteers demonstrated that 
on average 38% of the nominal dose is deposited into the lung. Both central and peripheral deposition 
were observed. 
Distribution
Glycopyrronium
The estimated glycopyrronium Vc/F (volume of the central compartment), and Vp1/F (volume of the 
peripheral compartment) are 741 L, and 2 990 L, respectively, via population pharmacokinetic 
analysis. Over the concentration range of 2-500 nmol/L, plasma protein binding of glycopyrronium 
ranged from 43% to 54%.
Formoterol
The estimated formoterol Vc/F (volume of the central compartment), and Vp1/F (volume of the 
peripheral compartment) are 1 030 L, and 647 L, respectively, via population pharmacokinetic 
analysis. Over the concentration range of 10-500 nmol/L, plasma protein binding of formoterol ranged 
from 46% to 58%. 
Biotransformation
Glycopyrronium
11
Based on literature, and an in-vitro human hepatocyte study, metabolism plays a minor role in the 
overall elimination of glycopyrronium. CYP2D6 was found to be the predominant enzyme involved in 
the metabolism of glycopyrronium.
In-vitro studies indicate the glycopyrronium does not inhibit any subtype of cytochrome P450 and that 
there is no induction of CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4.  
Formoterol
The primary metabolism of formoterol is by direct glucuronidation and by O-demethylation followed 
by conjugation to inactive metabolites. Secondary metabolic pathways include deformylation and 
sulfate conjugation. CYP2D6 and CYP2C have been identified as being primarily responsible for O-
demethylation.
In-vitro studies indicate that formoterol does not inhibit the CYP450 enzymes at therapeutically 
relevant concentrations.
Elimination
After intravenous administration of a 0.2 mg dose of radiolabelled glycopyrronium, 85% of the dose 
was recovered in urine 48 hours post dose and some of radioactivity was also recovered in bile. The 
terminal elimination half-life of glycopyrronium following oral inhalation derived via population 
pharmacokinetics analysis was 15 hours.
The excretion of formoterol was studied in six healthy subjects following simultaneous administration 
of radiolabelled formoterol via the oral and intravenous routes. In that study, 62% of the radiolabelled 
formoterol was excreted in the urine while 24% was eliminated in the faeces. The terminal elimination 
half-life of formoterol following oral inhalation derived via population pharmacokinetics analysis was 
13 hours.
Linearity/non-linearity
Linear pharmacokinetics were observed for glycopyrronium (dose range: 14.4 to 115.2 mcg) and 
formoterol (dose range: 2.4 to 19.2 mcg) after oral inhalation.
Special populations
Elderly 
Based on available data, no adjustment of the dose of Bevespi Aerosphere in geriatric patients is 
necessary.
Renal impairment
Studies evaluating the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of glycopyrronium and 
formoterol have not been conducted. The effect of renal impairment on the exposure to 
glycopyrronium and formoterol for up to 12 weeks was evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) varied from 30-196 mL/min, representing a 
range of moderate to no renal impairment. The systemic exposure (AUC0-12) in subjects with COPD 
with moderate-severe renal impairment (eGFR of 30-45 mL/min) is approximately 30% higher for 
glycopyrronium compared to subjects with COPD with normal renal function (eGFR of >90 mL/min). 
Subjects with COPD with both low body weight and moderate-severe impaired renal function may 
have an approximate doubling of systemic exposure to glycopyrronium. Renal function was found not 
to affect exposure to formoterol.
12
Hepatic impairment
No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with Bevespi Aerosphere in patients with hepatic 
impairment. However, because formoterol is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism, an 
increased exposure can be expected in patients with severe liver impairment. Glycopyrronium is 
primarily cleared from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and hepatic impairment would 
therefore not be expected to lead to unsafe systemic exposure.
Other special populations
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of glycopyrronium was performed based on data collected in a 
total of 311 subjects with COPD. The pharmacokinetics of glycopyrronium was best described by a 
two-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and linear elimination. The typical 
clearance (CL/F) of glycopyrronium was 124 L/h. 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of formoterol was performed based on data collected in a total 
of 437 subjects with COPD. The pharmacokinetics of formoterol was best described by a two-
compartment disposition model with a first-order rate constant of absorption and linear elimination. 
The typical clearance (CL/F) of formoterol was 99 L/h.  
Dose adjustments are not necessary based on the effect of age, sex and weight on the pharmacokinetic 
parameters of glycopyrronium and formoterol.
There were no major differences in total systemic exposure (AUC) for both compounds between 
healthy Japanese and Western subjects. Insufficient pharmacokinetic data are available to compare 
exposure for other ethnicities or races.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies of
safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.
The toxicity observed in studies with the combination of glycopyrronium and formoterol in dogs were 
associated with the pharmacological actions of formoterol, including effects mainly on the 
cardiovascular system, consisting of hyperaemia, tachycardia, arrhythmias and myocardial lesions. 
These are known pharmacological manifestations seen after administration of high doses of -
adrenoceptor agonists. No significant effects attributable to glycopyrronium were seen.
Animal reproduction studies with formoterol have shown a slightly reduced fertility in male rats at 
high systemic exposure and implantation losses, as well as decreased early postnatal survival and birth 
weight at considerably higher systemic exposures than those reached during clinical use. However, 
these animal experimental results have little relevance to man. A slight increase in the incidence of 
uterine leiomyomas has been observed in rats and mice treated with formoterol; an effect which is 
considered to be a class-effect in rodents after long-term exposure to high doses of β2-adrenoreceptor 
agonists.
Animal reproduction studies with glycopyrronium have shown reduced rat and rabbit fetal weights, 
and low body weight gain of rat offspring before weaning was observed at considerably higher 
systemic exposures than those reached during clinical use. No evidence of carcinogenicity was seen in 
2-year studies in rats and mice.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Bevespi Aerosphere is and what it is used for
Bevespi Aerosphere contains two active substances called glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate. These belong to a group of medicines called long-acting bronchodilators.  
Bevespi Aerosphere is used to make breathing easier for adults who have a lung disease called chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a long-term disease of the airways in the lungs,
which is often caused by smoking. In COPD, the muscles around the airways tighten which makes 
breathing difficult. 
The medicine prevents the tightening of the muscles around the airways, making it easier for air to get 
in and out of the lungs.
Bevespi Aerosphere delivers the active substances directly to the airways in your lungs as you breathe 
in. It will help to reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life.
2. What you need to know before you use Bevespi Aerosphere
Do not use Bevespi Aerosphere if
-
you are allergic to glycopyrronium, formoterol fumarate dihydrate or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or
pharmacist before using Bevespi Aerosphere. 
Warnings and precautions 
Bevespi Aerosphere is used regularly for long-term treatment of COPD. Do not use this medicine to 
treat a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing.
30
Immediate breathing difficulties
If you get tightness of the chest, coughing, wheezing or breathlessness immediately after using 
Bevespi Aerosphere:
Stop using this medicine and seek medical help immediately, as you may have a serious condition
called paradoxical bronchospasm.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Bevespi Aerosphere if
 you have asthma. Do not use this medicine for asthma
 you have heart problems
 you have diabetes
 you have low levels of potassium in the blood
 you have thyroid gland problems (called ‘thyrotoxicosis’)
 you have an eye problem called narrow-angle glaucoma (also called angle-closure glaucoma)
 you have prostate problems, or difficulty passing urine
 you have kidney or liver problems
Always tell your doctor about other health problems.
Children and adolescents
Bevespi Aerosphere is not for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Bevespi Aerosphere
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other
medicines.
Some medicines may affect how this medicine works, or make it more likely that you will have side 
effects. These include:

any medicines that work in the same way as Bevespi Aerosphere, such as medicines containing 
active substances such as tiotropium, ipratropium, aclidinium, umeclidinium, salmeterol,
vilanterol, olodaterol, or indacaterol. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. It is not 
recommended to use Bevespi Aerosphere together with these medicines;
medicines that lower potassium in your blood. These include:
o
o
o
corticosteroids that you take by mouth (such as prednisolone),
diuretics (such as furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide) used for high blood pressure,
some medicines used to treat breathing conditions called methylxanthines (such as 
theophylline);
medicines called beta-blockers that may be used to treat high blood pressure or other heart 
problems (such as atenolol or propranolol) or to treat glaucoma (such as timolol)
medicines which can prolong ‘QT interval’ (a change in the electrical activity of the heart). 
These include medicines for the treatment of:
o
o
o
depression (such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants),
bacterial infections (such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin),
allergic reactions (anti-histamines).

left. A puff of medicine is released each time you press the centre of the dose indicator. 
Before you use Bevespi Aerosphere for the first time
Before you use Bevespi Aerosphere for the first time, make sure that the pointer on the dose indicator 
is pointing to the right of the “120” inhalation mark in the dose indicator display window (See Figure 
1).

The pointer points to 120 after 10 puffs are delivered from Bevespi Aerosphere. This means that 
there are 120 puffs of medicine left in the pressurised container (See Figure 2a).
The pointer points between 100 and 120 after you use 10 more puffs. This means that there are 
110 puffs of medicine left in the pressurised container (See Figure 2b). 
The pointer points to 100 after you take 10 more puffs. This means that there are 100 puffs of 
medicine left in the pressurised container (See Figure 2c).

The dose indicator display window will move after every 10 puffs. The number in the dose 
indicator display window will change after every 20 puffs.
Figure 2d
The colour in the dose indicator display window will change to red, as shown in the shaded 
area, when there are only 20 puffs of medicine left in your inhaler (See Figure 2d).
When the arrow reaches ‘0’, you must stop using your inhaler. Your inhaler may not feel empty
and it may seem as though it still works. However, you will not get the right amount of 
medicine if you keep using it.
Preparing your Bevespi Aerosphere inhaler for use:

Your Bevespi Aerosphere inhaler comes in a foil pouch that contains a drying packet 
(desiccant).
o Take the Bevespi Aerosphere inhaler out of the foil pouch. 
o Throw away the pouch and the drying packet. Do not use the inhaler if the drying agent has
leaked out of its packet.

Priming your Bevespi Aerosphere inhaler:
Figure 3
Before you use Bevespi Aerosphere for the first time, you must prime the inhaler.

Remove the cap from the mouthpiece (See Figure 3). Check inside the mouthpiece before you 
use the inhaler to make sure it is clear. 
Hold the inhaler upright, away from your face and shake it well (See Figure 4). 
Figure 4
Press down firmly on the centre of the dose indicator until the pressurised container stops 
moving in the actuator. This will release a puff of medicine from the mouthpiece (See Figure 
5). You may hear a soft click from the dose indicator as it counts down during use.
Figure 5
Repeat the priming steps 3 more times (See Figure 4 and Figure 5). Shake the inhaler well 
before each priming puff. 
After priming 4 times, the dose indicator should be pointing to the right of “120” and your 
inhaler is now ready to use. 
Using your Bevespi Aerosphere inhaler:
Step 1: Remove the cap from the mouthpiece (See Figure 6).
39
Step 2:  Shake the inhaler well before each use (See Figure 7).
Figure 6
Step 3:  Hold the inhaler with the mouthpiece pointing towards you and breathe out as fully as you
comfortably can through your mouth (See Figure 8). 
Figure 7
Step 4:  Close your lips around the mouthpiece and tilt your head back, keeping your tongue below 
the mouthpiece (See Figure 9).

Step 5:  While breathing in deeply and slowly, press down on the centre of the dose indicator until the 
pressurised container stops moving in the actuator and a puff of medicine has been released 
(See Figure 10). Then stop pressing the dose indicator.
Step 6:  When you have finished breathing in, remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Hold your 
breath as long as you comfortably can, up to 10 seconds (See Figure 11). 
Figure 10
Step 7:  Breathe out gently (See Figure 12). Repeat steps 2 to 7 to take your second puff of Bevespi 
Aerosphere.

How to clean your Bevespi Aerosphere inhaler:
Clean the inhaler once each week for the first 3 weeks. It is very important to keep your inhaler 
clean so that medicine does not build-up and block the spray through the mouthpiece (See Figure 14).
Step 1:  Take the pressurised container out of the actuator (See Figure 15). Do not clean the 
pressurised container or let it get wet. 
Figure 14
42
Step 2:  Take the cap off the mouthpiece.
Figure 15
Step 3: Hold the actuator under the tap and run warm water through it for about 30 seconds. Turn the 
actuator upside down and rinse the actuator again through the mouthpiece for about 30 
seconds (See Figure 16). 
Step 4: Shake off as much water from the actuator as you can.
Figure 16
Step 5: Look into the actuator and the mouthpiece to make sure any medicine build-up has been 
completely washed away. If there is any built-up medicine, repeat Steps 3 to 5 in the section.
Step 6: Let the actuator air-dry overnight (See Figure 17). Do not put the pressurised container back 
into the actuator if it is still wet.
43
Step 7:  When the actuator is dry, gently press the pressurised container down in the actuator (See 
Figure 18). Do not press down too hard on the pressurised container. This could cause a puff 
of medicine to be released.

Step 8: Re-prime your Bevespi Aerosphere inhaler after each cleaning. To re-prime the inhaler, 
shake the inhaler well and press down on the centre of the dose indicator twice to release a 
total of 2 puffs into the air away from your face. Your inhaler is now ready to use. 
If you do not use your Bevespi Aerosphere for more than 7 days or if exposed to low
temperatures or is dropped:
If you do not use your Bevespi Aerosphere for more than 7 days, or if the inhaler is exposed to low
temperatures or has been dropped, you will need to re-prime it before use. 
To re-prime the inhaler, shake the inhaler well and press down on the centre of the dose indicator 
twice to release a total of 2 puffs into the air away from your face. Your inhaler is now ready to use.

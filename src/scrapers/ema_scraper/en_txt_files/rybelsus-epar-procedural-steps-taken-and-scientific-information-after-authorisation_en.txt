Hypersensitivity with frequency uncommon has been added 
‘Hypersensitivity’ to the list of adverse drug reactions 
with frequency uncommon; the Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to 
the PI. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
to the list of adverse drug reactions. The detection of 
hypersensitivity is the outcome of a signal of 
hypersensitivity including rash and urticaria identified via 
routine signal detection activities examining post-marketing 
data for oral semaglutide. For more information, please 
refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

SmPC 
In a 52-week open-label trial, 1748 subjects with 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 5.1 of the Ozempic SmPC in order 
to include information on the use of semaglutide s.c. 
once weekly vs insulin aspart three times daily, both 
as add-on to metformin and optimised insulin 
glargine U100 treatment in subjects with 
inadequately controlled T2DM; based on the final 
report from study NN9535-4386 (SUSTAIN-11), 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a 52-
week, multi-centre, multinational, open-label, active 
controlled, two armed, parallel, randomised trial 
undertaken to investigate the effect on glycaemic 
control, body weight, safety and health-related 
quality of life. The SmPC of Rybelsus (semaglutide 
p.o.) is not impacted. The RMP common for both 
products has also been updated to version 7.1. 
inadequately controlled T2D after a 12-week run-in period 
on insulin glargine and metformin were randomised to 1:1 
to receive either semaglutide once-weekly (0.5 mg or 1.0 
mg) or insulin aspart three times daily. The included 
population had a mean diabetes duration of 13.4 years and 
a mean HbA1c of 8.6%, with a target HbA1c of 6.5-7.5%. 
Treatment with semaglutide resulted in reduction in HbA1c 
at week 52 (-1.5% for semaglutide vs. -1.2% for insulin 
aspart). The number of severe hypoglycaemic episodes in 
both treatment arms was low (4 episodes with semaglutide 
vs. 7 episodes with insulin aspart). Mean baseline body 
weight decreased with semaglutide (-4.1 kg) and increased 
with insulin aspart (+2.8 kg) and the estimated treatment 
difference was -6.99 kg (95%CI -7.41 to -6.57) at week 
52.

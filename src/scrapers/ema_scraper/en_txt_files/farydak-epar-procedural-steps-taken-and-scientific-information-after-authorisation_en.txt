Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update 
25/02/2016

SmPC, Annex 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated to include the 
the safety information with regard to the key 
II and Labelling 
results from the final analysis of the Overall survival (OS) 
secondary endpoint of overall survival in the study 
D2308 to fulfil an Annex II condition (ANX 001). The 
Annex II of the product information is updated 
accordingly to remove the condition. As a 
consequence the RMP ver.2.2 is provided. In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to correct an oversight in the 
Annex IIIA and add the Days and Weeks in section 5 
under ‘Other’ in alignment with the approved blister 
foil mock-ups. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
from the pivotal study CLBH589D2308. OS was the key 
secondary endpoint. OS was not statistically significantly 
different between the two treatment groups. The median 
OS was 40.3 months in the panobinostat + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone arm and 35.8 months in the placebo + 
bortezomib + dexamethasone arm (Hazard ratio: 0.94 
(95% CI: 0.78, 1.14)).

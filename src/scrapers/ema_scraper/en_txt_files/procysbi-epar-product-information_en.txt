CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
PROCYSBI is indicated for the treatment of proven nephropathic cystinosis. Cysteamine reduces 
cystine accumulation in some cells (e.g. leukocytes, muscle and liver cells) of nephropathic cystinosis 
patients and, when treatment is started early, it delays the development of renal failure.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
PROCYSBI treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of cystinosis. 
Cysteamine therapy must be initiated promptly once the diagnosis is confirmed (i.e., increased WBC 
cystine) to achieve maximum benefit. 
Posology 
White blood cell (WBC) cystine concentration may for instance be measured by a number of different 
techniques such as specific WBC subsets (e.g., granulocyte assay) or the mixed leukocyte assay with 
each assay having different target values. Healthcare professionals should refer to the assay-specific 
therapeutic targets provided by individual testing laboratories when making decisions regarding 
diagnosis and PROCYSBI dosing for cystinosis patients. For example the therapeutic goal is to 
maintain a WBC cystine level < 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein (when measured using the mixed 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
leukocyte assay), 30 min after dosing For patients adherent to a stable dose of PROCYSBI, and who 
do not have easy access to an adequate facility for measuring their WBC cystine, the goal of therapy 
should be to maintain plasma cysteamine concentration > 0.1 mg/L, 30 min after dosing. 
Measurement timing: PROCYSBI should be administered every 12 hours. The determination of WBC 
cystine and/or plasma cysteamine must be obtained 12.5 hours after the evening dose the day before, 
and therefore 30 minutes after the following morning dose is given. 
Transferring patients from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate hard capsules  
Patients with cystinosis taking immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate may be transferred to a total 
daily dose of PROCYSBI equal to their previous total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine 
bitartrate. Total daily dose should be divided by two and administered every 12 hours. The maximum 
recommended dose of cysteamine is 1.95 g/m2/day. The use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
Patients being transferred from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate to PROCYSBI should have 
their WBC cystine levels measured in 2 weeks, and thereafter every 3 months to assess optimal dose 
as described above. 
Newly diagnosed adult patients 
Newly diagnosed adult patients should be started on 1/6 to 1/4 of the targeted maintenance dose of 
PROCYSBI. The targeted maintenance dose is 1.3 g/m2/day, in two divided doses, given every 
12 hours (see below table 1). The dose should be raised if there is adequate tolerance and the WBC 
cystine level remains > 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein (when measured using the mixed leukocyte 
assay). The maximum recommended dose of cysteamine is 1.95 g/m2/day. The use of doses higher 
than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended (see section 4.4).  
The target values provided in the SmPC are obtained from using the mixed leucocyte assay. It should 
be noted that therapeutic targets for cystine depletion are assay-specific and different assays have 
specific treatment targets. Therefore, healthcare professionals should refer to the assay-specific 
therapeutic targets provided by individual testing laboratories. 
Newly diagnosed paediatric population 
The targeted maintenance dose of 1.3 g/m2/day can be approximated according to the following table, 
which takes surface area as well as weight into consideration.

*Higher dose may be required to achieve target WBC cystine concentration.  
The use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended. 
Missed doses 
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. If it is within four hours of the next dose, the 
missed dose should be skipped going back to the regular dosing schedule. The dose should not be 
doubled.

Special populations 
Patients with poor tolerability 
Patients with poorer tolerability still receive significant benefit if white blood cell cystine levels are 
below 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein (when measured using the mixed leukocyte assay). The 
cysteamine dose can be increased to a maximum of 1.95 g/m2/day to achieve this level. The dose of 
1.95 g/m2/day of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate has been associated with an increased rate of 
withdrawal from treatment due to intolerance and an increased incidence of adverse events. If 
cysteamine is initially poorly tolerated due to gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms or transient skin 
rashes, therapy should be temporarily stopped, then re-instituted at a lower dose and gradually 
increased to the appropriate dose (see section 4.4).  
Patients on dialysis or post-transplantation  
Experience has occasionally shown that some forms of cysteamine are less well tolerated (i.e. leading 
to more adverse events) when patients are on dialysis. A closer monitoring of the WBC cystine levels 
is recommended in these patients.   
Patients with renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not normally required; however, WBC cystine levels should be monitored. 
Patients with hepatic impairment  
Dose adjustment is not normally required; however, WBC cystine levels should be monitored. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
This medicinal product can be administered by swallowing the intact capsules as well as sprinkling the 
capsule contents (enteric coated beads) on food or delivery through a gastric feeding tube. 
Do not crush or chew capsules or capsule contents. 
Administration with food 
Cysteamine bitartrate can be administered with an acidic fruit juice or water. 
Cysteamine bitartrate should not be administered with food rich in fat or proteins, or with frozen food 
like ice-cream. Patients should try to consistently avoid meals and dairy products for at least 1 hour 
before and 1 hour after PROCYSBI dosing. If fasting during this period is not possible, it is acceptable 
to eat only a small amount (∼ 100 grams) of food (preferentially carbohydrates) during the hour before 
and after PROCYSBI administration. It is important to dose PROCYSBI in relation to food intake in a 
consistent and reproducible way over time (see section 5.2). 
In paediatric patients who are at risk of aspiration, aged approximately 6 years and under, the hard 
capsules should be opened and the content sprinkled on food or liquid listed in section 6.6. 
For instructions about the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, any form of cysteamine (mercaptamine), or to any of 
the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to penicillamine. 
Breast-feeding. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended (see section 4.2). 
Oral cysteamine has not been shown to prevent eye deposition of cystine crystals. Therefore, where 
cysteamine ophthalmic solution is used for that purpose, its usage should continue.  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered and the patient 
must be advised of the possible teratogenic risk of cysteamine (see section 4.6). 
Intact capsules of PROCYSBI should not be administered to children under the age of approximately 
6 years due to risk of aspiration (see section 4.2). 
Dermatological 
There have been reports of serious skin lesions in patients treated with high doses of immediate-
release cysteamine bitartrate or other cysteamine salts that have responded to cysteamine dose 
reduction. Physicians should routinely monitor the skin and bones of patients receiving cysteamine. 
If skin or bone abnormalities appear, the dose of cysteamine should be reduced or stopped. Treatment 
may be restarted at a lower dose under close supervision, and then slowly titrated to the appropriate 
therapeutic dose (see sections 4.2). If a severe skin rash develops such as erythema multiforme bullosa 
or toxic epidermal necrolysis, cysteamine should not be re-administered (see sections 4.8). 
Gastrointestinal 
GI ulceration and bleeding have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine 
bitartrate. Physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding and should inform 
patients and/or guardians about the signs and symptoms of serious GI toxicity and what steps to take if 
they occur. 
GI tract symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain have been associated 
with cysteamine. 
Strictures of the ileo-caecum and large bowel (fibrosing colonopathy) was first described in cystic 
fibrosis patients who were given high doses of pancreatic enzymes in the form of tablets with an 
enteric coating of methacrylic acid - ethyl acrylate copolymer (1:1), one of the excipients in 
PROCYSBI. As a precaution, unusual abdominal symptoms or changes in abdominal symptoms 
should be medically assessed to exclude the possibility of fibrosing colonopathy. 
Central Nervous System (CNS) 
CNS symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy have been 
associated with cysteamine. If CNS symptoms develop, the patient should be carefully evaluated and 
the dose adjusted as necessary. Patients should not engage in potentially hazardous activities until the 
effects of cysteamine on mental performance are known (see section 4.7).  
Leukopenia and abnormal liver function 
Cysteamine has occasionally been associated with reversible leukopenia and abnormal liver function. 
Therefore, blood counts and liver function should be monitored.  
Benign intracranial hypertension 
There have been reports of benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri (PTC)) and/or 
papilledema associated with cysteamine bitartrate treatment that has resolved with the addition of 
diuretic therapy (post-marketing experience with the immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate). 
Physicians should instruct patients to report any of the following symptoms: headache, tinnitus, 
dizziness, nausea, diplopia, blurred vision, loss of vision, pain behind the eye or pain with eye 
movement. A periodic eye examination is needed to identify this condition early and timely treatment 
should be provided when it occurs to prevent vision loss.

PROCYSBI contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
It cannot be excluded that cysteamine is a clinically relevant inducer of CYP enzymes, inhibitor of 
P-gp and BCRP at the intestinal level and inhibitor of liver uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3 
and OCT1). 
Co-administration with electrolyte and mineral replacement 
Cysteamine can be administered with electrolyte (except bicarbonate) and mineral replacements 
necessary for management of Fanconi syndrome as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone. 
Bicarbonate should be administered at least one hour before or one hour after PROCYSBI to avoid 
potential earlier release of cysteamine. 
Indomethacin and cysteamine have been used simultaneously in some patients. In cases of patients 
with kidney transplants, anti-rejection treatments have been used with cysteamine. 
Co-administration of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole and PROCYSBI in vivo showed no effects 
on cysteamine bitartrate exposure.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should be informed about the risk of teratogenicity and advised to 
use an adequate method of contraception during the course of treatment. A negative pregnancy test 
should be confirmed before starting treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There is no adequate data from the use of cysteamine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenesis (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. The effect on pregnancy of untreated cystinosis is also unknown. Therefore, cysteamine 
bitartrate should not be used during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, unless clearly 
necessary (see section 4.4). 
If a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered.  
Breast-feeding 
Cysteamine excretion in human milk is unknown. However, due to the results of animal studies in 
breast-feeding females and neonates (see section 5.3), breast-feeding is contra-indicated in women 
taking PROCYSBI (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Effects on fertility have been seen in animal studies (see section 5.3). Azoospermia has been reported 
in male cystinosis patients. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cysteamine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Cysteamine may cause drowsiness. When starting therapy, patients should not engage in potentially 
hazardous activities until the effects of the medicinal product on each individual are known. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
For the immediate-release formulation of cysteamine bitartrate, approximately 35% of patients can be 
expected to experience adverse reactions. These mainly involve the gastrointestinal and central 
nervous systems. When these reactions appear at the initiation of cysteamine therapy, temporary 
suspension and gradual reintroduction of treatment may be effective in improving tolerance. 
In clinical studies with healthy volunteers, the most frequent adverse reactions were very common GI 
symptoms (16%) and occurred primarily as single episodes that were mild or moderate in severity. 
The adverse reactions profile for healthy subjects was similar to the adverse reactions profile in 
patients relative to GI disorders (diarrhoea and abdominal pain).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare 
(<1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:

nervous system disorders (headache, somnolence and lethargy) and common general disorders 
(asthenia) were also seen.  
Post-marketing experience with immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate 
Benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri (PTC)) with papilledema; skin lesions, 
molluscoid pseudotumors, skin striae, skin fragility; joint hyperextension, leg pain, genu valgum, 
osteopenia, compression fracture and scoliosis have been reported with immediate-release cysteamine 
bitartrate (see section 4.4).  
Two cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported within 6 months of starting therapy with 
progressive recovery after treatment discontinuation. Histology showed a membranous 
glomerulonephritis of the renal allograft in one case and hypersensitivity interstitial nephritis in the 
other. 
A few cases of Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome on elbows have been reported in children chronically 
treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations (cysteamine chlorhydrate or cystamine or 
cysteamine bitartrate) mostly above the maximal dose 1.95 g/m2/day. In some cases, these skin lesions 
were associated with skin striae and bone lesions first seen during an X-ray examination. Bone 
disorders reported were genu valgum, leg pain and hyperextensive joints, osteopenia, compression 
fractures, and scoliosis. In the few cases where histopathological examination of the skin was 
performed, the results suggested angioendotheliomatosis. One patient subsequently died of acute 
cerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy. In some patients, the skin lesions on elbows regressed 
after immediate-release cysteamine dose reduction (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
An overdose of cysteamine may cause progressive lethargy. 
Should overdosing occur, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be supported 
appropriately. No specific antidote is known. It is not known if cysteamine is removed by 
haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism product, amino acids and 
derivatives, ATC code: A16AA04. 
Cysteamine is the simplest stable aminothiol and a degradation product of the amino acid cysteine. 
Cysteamine participates within lysosomes in a thiol-disulfide interchange reaction converting cystine 
into cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfide, both of which can exit the lysosome in patients 
with cystinosis. 
Normal individuals and persons heterozygous for cystinosis have white blood cell cystine levels of 
< 0.2 and usually below 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein, respectively, when measured using the mixed 
leukocyte assay. Individuals with cystinosis have elevations of WBC cystine above 
2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
WBC cystine is monitored in these patients to determine adequacy of dosing, levels being measured 
30 minutes after dosing when treated with PROCYSBI.  
A pivotal phase 3 randomised, crossover PK and PD study (which was also the first ever randomised 
study with immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate) demonstrated that at steady-state, patients 
receiving PROCYSBI every 12 hours (Q12H) maintained a comparable depletion of WBC cystine 
levels compared to immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate every 6 hours (Q6H). Forty-three (43) 
patients were randomised; twenty-seven (27) children (ages 6 to 12 years old), fifteen (15) adolescents 
(ages 12 to 21 years old) and one (1) adult with cystinosis and with native kidney function based on an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (corrected for body surface area) > 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 
were randomised. Of those forty-three (43) patients, two (2) siblings withdrew at the end of the first 
crossover period, due to a prior planned surgery in one (1) of them; forty-one (41) patients completed 
the protocol. Two (2) patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis because their WBC 
cystine level increased over 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein during the immediate-release cysteamine 
treatment period. Thirty-nine (39) patients were included in the final primary per protocol efficacy 
analysis.

Forty of forty-one (40/41) patients who completed the pivotal phase 3 study were entered in a 
prospective study with PROCYSBI that stayed open as long as PROCYSBI could not be prescribed by 
their treating physician. In this study, the WBC cystine measured using the mixed leukocyte assay was 
always on average under optimal control at < 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein. The estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not change for the study population over time.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The relative bioavailability is about 125% as compared to immediate-release cysteamine. 
Food intake reduces the absorption of PROCYSBI at 30 minutes pre-dose (approximately 35% 
decrease in exposure) and at 30 min post-dose (approximately 16 or 45% decrease in exposure for 
intact and open capsules respectively). Food intake two hours after administration did not affect the 
absorption of PROCYSBI.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of cysteamine, primarily to albumin, is approximately 54% and 
independent of plasma drug concentration over the therapeutic range.  
Biotransformation 
The elimination of unchanged cysteamine in the urine has been shown to range between 0.3% and 
1.7% of the total daily dose in four patients; the bulk of cysteamine is excreted as sulphate. 
In vitro data suggests that cysteamine bitartrate is likely to be metabolised by multiple CYP enzymes, 
including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP2A6 and 
CYP3A4 were not involved in the metabolism of cysteamine bitartrate under the experimental 
conditions.  
Elimination 
The terminal half-life of cysteamine bitartrate is approximately 4 hours.  
Cysteamine bitartrate is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in vitro. 
In vitro: Cysteamine bitartrate is a substrate of P-gp and OCT2, but not a substrate of BCRP, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT1. Cysteamine bitartrate is not an inhibitor of OAT1, 
OAT3 and OCT2.  
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetics of cysteamine bitartrate has not been studied in special populations.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In genotoxicity studies published for cysteamine, induction of chromosome aberrations in cultured 
eukaryotic cell lines has been reported. Specific studies with cysteamine did not show any mutagenic 
effects in the Ames test or any clastogenic effect in the mouse micronucleus test. A bacterial reverse 
mutation assay study (“Ames test”) was performed with the cysteamine bitartrate used for PROCYSBI 
and cysteamine bitartrate did not show any mutagenic effects in this test. 
Reproduction studies showed embryo-foetotoxic effects (resorptions and post-implantation losses) in 
rats at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level and in rabbits receiving cysteamine 50 mg/kg/day. Teratogenic 
effects have been described in rats when cysteamine is administered over the period of organogenesis 
at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day. 
This is equivalent to 0.6 g/m2/day in the rat, which is slightly less than the recommended clinical 
maintenance dose of cysteamine, i.e. 1.3 g/m2/day. A reduction of fertility was observed in rats at 
375 mg/kg/day, a dose at which body weight gain was retarded. At this dose, weight gain and survival 
of the offspring during lactation was also reduced. High doses of cysteamine impair the ability of 
lactating mothers to feed their pups. Single doses of the drug inhibit prolactin secretion in animals. 
Administration of cysteamine in neonate rats induced cataracts. 
High doses of cysteamine, either by oral or parenteral routes, produce duodenal ulcers in rats and mice 
but not in monkeys. Experimental administration of the drug causes depletion of somatostatin in 
several animal species. The consequence of this for the clinical use of the drug is unknown. 
No carcinogenic studies have been conducted with cysteamine bitartrate gastro-resistant hard capsules.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Handling 
Sprinkling on food 
Capsules for either the morning or evening dose should be opened and the contents sprinkled onto 
approximately 100 grams of apple sauce or fruit jam. Gently stir the contents into the soft food, 
creating a mixture of cysteamine granules and food. The entire amount of the mixture should be eaten. 
This may be followed by 250 mL of an acceptable acidic liquid - fruit juice (e.g., orange juice or any 
acidic fruit juice) or water. The mixture must be eaten within 2 hours after preparation and may be 
refrigerated from the time of preparation to the time of administration. 
Administering through feeding tubes 
Capsules for either the morning or evening dose should be opened and the contents sprinkled onto 
approximately 100 grams of apple sauce or fruit jam. Gently stir the contents into the soft food, 
creating a mixture of cysteamine granules and the soft food. The mixture should then be administered 
via gastrostomy tube, nasogastric tube or gastrostomy-jejunostomy tube using a catheter tip syringe. 
Before PROCYSBI administration: Unclasp the G-tube button and attach the feeding tube. Flush with 
5 mL of water to clear the button. Draw the mixture up into the syringe. A maximum 60 mL mixture 
volume in a catheter tip syringe is recommended for use with a straight or bolus feeding tube. Place 
the opening of the syringe containing the PROCYSBI/apple sauce/fruit jam mixture into the opening 
of the feeding tube and fill completely with the mixture: pressing gently on the syringe and keeping 
the feeding tube horizontal during administration can help to avoid clogging issues. Using a viscous 
food such as apple sauce or fruit jam at a rate of about 10 mL every 10 seconds until the syringe is 
completely empty, is also suggested to avoid clogging. Repeat the above step until all of the mixture is 
given. After PROCYSBI administration, draw 10 mL of fruit juice or water up into another syringe 
and flush the G-tube ensuring that none of the apple sauce/fruit jam and granules mixture gets stuck on 
the G-tube. 
The mixture must be administered within 2 hours after preparation and may be refrigerated from the 
time of preparation to the time of administration. Nothing of the mixture should be saved. 
Sprinkling in orange juice or any acidic fruit juice or water 
Capsules for either the morning or evening dose should be opened and the contents sprinkled into 100 
to 150 mL of acidic fruit juice or water. Dose administration options are provided below:  
• 
Option 1/Syringe: Mix gently for 5 minutes, then aspirate the mixture of cysteamine granules 
and acidic fruit juice or water into a dosing syringe. 
Option 2/Cup: Mix gently for 5 minutes in a cup or shake gently for 5 minutes in a covered cup 
(e.g., “sippy” cup). Drink the mixture of cysteamine granules and acidic fruit juice or water. 
The mixture must be administered (drunk) within 30 minutes after preparation and may be refrigerated 
from the time of preparation to the time of administration. 
• 
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Gastro-resistant granules. 
White to off-white granules. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
PROCYSBI is indicated for the treatment of proven nephropathic cystinosis. Cysteamine reduces 
cystine accumulation in some cells (e.g. leukocytes, muscle and liver cells) of nephropathic cystinosis 
patients and, when treatment is started early, it delays the development of renal failure.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
PROCYSBI treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of cystinosis. 
Cysteamine therapy must be initiated promptly once the diagnosis is confirmed (i.e., increased WBC 
cystine) to achieve maximum benefit. 
Posology 
White blood cell (WBC) cystine concentration may for instance be measured by a number of different 
techniques such as specific WBC subsets (e.g., granulocyte assay) or the mixed leukocyte assay with 
each assay having different target values. Healthcare professionals should refer to the assay-specific 
therapeutic targets provided by individual testing laboratories when making decisions regarding 
diagnosis and PROCYSBI dosing for cystinosis patients. For example the therapeutic goal is to 
maintain a WBC cystine level < 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein (when measured using the mixed 
leukocyte assay), 30 min after dosing For patients adherent to a stable dose of PROCYSBI, and who 
do not have easy access to an adequate facility for measuring their WBC cystine, the goal of therapy 
should be to maintain plasma cysteamine concentration > 0.1 mg/L, 30 min after dosing. 
Measurement timing: PROCYSBI should be administered every 12 hours. The determination of WBC 
cystine and/or plasma cysteamine must be obtained 12.5 hours after the evening dose the day before, 
and therefore 30 minutes after the following morning dose is given.

Transferring patients from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate hard capsules  
Patients with cystinosis taking immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate may be transferred to a total 
daily dose of PROCYSBI equal to their previous total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine 
bitartrate. Total daily dose should be divided by two and administered every 12 hours. The maximum 
recommended dose of cysteamine is 1.95 g/m2/day. The use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
Patients being transferred from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate to PROCYSBI should have 
their WBC cystine levels measured in 2 weeks, and thereafter every 3 months to assess optimal dose 
as described above. 
Newly diagnosed adult patients 
Newly diagnosed adult patients should be started on 1/6 to 1/4 of the targeted maintenance dose of 
PROCYSBI. The targeted maintenance dose is 1.3 g/m2/day, in two divided doses, given every 
12 hours (see below table 1). The dose should be raised if there is adequate tolerance and the WBC 
cystine level remains > 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein (when measured using the mixed leukocyte 
assay). The maximum recommended dose of cysteamine is 1.95 g/m2/day. The use of doses higher 
than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended (see section 4.4).  
The target values provided in the SmPC are obtained from using the mixed leucocyte assay. It should 
be noted that therapeutic targets for cystine depletion are assay-specific and different assays have 
specific treatment targets. Therefore, healthcare professionals should refer to the assay-specific 
therapeutic targets provided by individual testing laboratories. 
Newly diagnosed paediatric population 
The targeted maintenance dose of 1.3 g/m2/day can be approximated according to the following table, 
which takes surface area as well as weight into consideration.

*Higher dose may be required to achieve target WBC cystine concentration.  
The use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended. 
To reach the targeted maintenance dose, the use of PROCYSBI 25 mg gastro-resistant hard capsules 
could be considered. 
Missed doses 
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. If it is within four hours of the next dose, the 
missed dose should be skipped going back to the regular dosing schedule. The dose should not be 
doubled.  
Special populations 
Patients with poor tolerability 
Patients with poorer tolerability still receive significant benefit if white blood cell cystine levels are 
below 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein (when measured using the mixed leukocyte assay). The 
cysteamine dose can be increased to a maximum of 1.95 g/m2/day to achieve this level. The dose of 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.95 g/m2/day of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate has been associated with an increased rate of 
withdrawal from treatment due to intolerance and an increased incidence of adverse events. If 
cysteamine is initially poorly tolerated due to gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms or transient skin 
rashes, therapy should be temporarily stopped, then re-instituted at a lower dose and gradually 
increased to the appropriate dose (see section 4.4).  
Patients on dialysis or post-transplantation 
Experience has occasionally shown that some forms of cysteamine are less well tolerated (i.e. leading 
to more adverse events) when patients are on dialysis. A closer monitoring of the WBC cystine levels 
is recommended in these patients. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not normally required; however, WBC cystine levels should be monitored. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Dose adjustment is not normally required; however, WBC cystine levels should be monitored. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
This medicinal product can be administered by opening the sachet and sprinkling the sachet contents 
(enteric coated beads) on food or drink or delivering through a gastric feeding tube. 
Do not crush or chew granules, as this impairs the gastro-resistant coating. 
Administration with food 
Cysteamine bitartrate can be administered with an acidic fruit juice or water. 
Cysteamine bitartrate should not be administered with food rich in fat or proteins, or with frozen food 
like ice-cream. Patients should try to consistently avoid meals and dairy products for at least 1 hour 
before and 1 hour after PROCYSBI dosing. If fasting during this period is not possible, it is acceptable 
to eat only a small amount (∼ 100 grams) of food (preferentially carbohydrates) during the hour before 
and after PROCYSBI administration. It is important to dose PROCYSBI in relation to food intake in a 
consistent and reproducible way over time (see section 5.2). 
For instructions about the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, any form of cysteamine (mercaptamine), or to any of 
the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to penicillamine. 
Breast-feeding. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended (see section 4.2). 
Oral cysteamine has not been shown to prevent eye deposition of cystine crystals. Therefore, where 
cysteamine ophthalmic solution is used for that purpose, its usage should continue.  
If a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered and the patient 
must be advised of the possible teratogenic risk of cysteamine (see section 4.6).

Dermatological 
There have been reports of serious skin lesions in patients treated with high doses of immediate-
release cysteamine bitartrate or other cysteamine salts that have responded to cysteamine dose 
reduction. Physicians should routinely monitor the skin and bones of patients receiving cysteamine. 
If skin or bone abnormalities appear, the dose of cysteamine should be reduced or stopped. Treatment 
may be restarted at a lower dose under close supervision, and then slowly titrated to the appropriate 
therapeutic dose (see sections 4.2). If a severe skin rash develops such as erythema multiforme bullosa 
or toxic epidermal necrolysis, cysteamine should not be re-administered (see sections 4.8). 
Gastrointestinal 
GI ulceration and bleeding have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine 
bitartrate. Physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding and should inform 
patients and/or guardians about the signs and symptoms of serious GI toxicity and what steps to take if 
they occur. 
GI tract symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain have been associated 
with cysteamine. 
Strictures of the ileo-caecum and large bowel (fibrosing colonopathy) was first described in cystic 
fibrosis patients who were given high doses of pancreatic enzymes in the form of tablets with an 
enteric coating of methacrylic acid - ethyl acrylate copolymer (1:1), one of the excipients in 
PROCYSBI. As a precaution, unusual abdominal symptoms or changes in abdominal symptoms 
should be medically assessed to exclude the possibility of fibrosing colonopathy. 
Central Nervous System (CNS) 
CNS symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy have been 
associated with cysteamine. If CNS symptoms develop, the patient should be carefully evaluated and 
the dose adjusted as necessary. Patients should not engage in potentially hazardous activities until the 
effects of cysteamine on mental performance are known (see section 4.7).  
Leukopenia and abnormal liver function 
Cysteamine has occasionally been associated with reversible leukopenia and abnormal liver function. 
Therefore, blood counts and liver function should be monitored.  
Benign intracranial hypertension 
There have been reports of benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri (PTC)) and/or 
papilledema associated with cysteamine bitartrate treatment that has resolved with the addition of 
diuretic therapy (post-marketing experience with the immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate). 
Physicians should instruct patients to report any of the following symptoms: headache, tinnitus, 
dizziness, nausea, diplopia, blurred vision, loss of vision, pain behind the eye or pain with eye 
movement. A periodic eye examination is needed to identify this condition early and timely treatment 
should be provided when it occurs to prevent vision loss.  
PROCYSBI contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
It cannot be excluded that cysteamine is a clinically relevant inducer of CYP enzymes, inhibitor of 
P-gp and BCRP at the intestinal level and inhibitor of liver uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3 
and OCT1). 
Co-administration with electrolyte and mineral replacement 
Cysteamine can be administered with electrolyte (except bicarbonate) and mineral replacements 
necessary for management of Fanconi syndrome as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone. 
Bicarbonate should be administered at least one hour before or one hour after PROCYSBI to avoid 
potential earlier release of cysteamine. 
Indomethacin and cysteamine have been used simultaneously in some patients. In cases of patients 
with kidney transplants, anti-rejection treatments have been used with cysteamine. 
Co-administration of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole and PROCYSBI in vivo showed no effects 
on cysteamine bitartrate exposure.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should be informed about the risk of teratogenicity and advised to 
use an adequate method of contraception during the course of treatment. A negative pregnancy test 
should be confirmed before starting treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There is no adequate data from the use of cysteamine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenesis (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. The effect on pregnancy of untreated cystinosis is also unknown. Therefore, cysteamine 
bitartrate should not be used during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, unless clearly 
necessary (see section 4.4). 
If a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered. 
Breast-feeding 
Cysteamine excretion in human milk is unknown. However, due to the results of animal studies in 
breast-feeding females and neonates (see section 5.3), breast-feeding is contra-indicated in women 
taking PROCYSBI (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Effects on fertility have been seen in animal studies (see section 5.3). Azoospermia has been reported 
in male cystinosis patients. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cysteamine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Cysteamine may cause drowsiness. When starting therapy, patients should not engage in potentially 
hazardous activities until the effects of the medicinal product on each individual are known.

4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
For the immediate-release formulation of cysteamine bitartrate, approximately 35% of patients can be 
expected to experience adverse reactions. These mainly involve the gastrointestinal and central 
nervous systems. When these reactions appear at the initiation of cysteamine therapy, temporary 
suspension and gradual reintroduction of treatment may be effective in improving tolerance. 
In clinical studies with healthy volunteers, the most frequent adverse reactions were very common GI 
symptoms (16%) and occurred primarily as single episodes that were mild or moderate in severity. 
The adverse reactions profile for healthy subjects was similar to the adverse reactions profile in 
patients relative to GI disorders (diarrhoea and abdominal pain).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare 
(<1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:

Clinical studies experience with PROCYSBI 
In clinical studies comparing PROCYSBI to the immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate, one third of 
the patients exhibited very common GI disorders (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain). Common 
nervous system disorders (headache, somnolence and lethargy) and common general disorders 
(asthenia) were also seen.  
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Post-marketing experience with immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate 
Benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri (PTC)) with papilledema; skin lesions, 
molluscoid pseudotumors, skin striae, skin fragility; joint hyperextension, leg pain, genu valgum, 
osteopenia, compression fracture and scoliosis have been reported with immediate-release cysteamine 
bitartrate (see section 4.4).  
Two cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported within 6 months of starting therapy with 
progressive recovery after treatment discontinuation. Histology showed a membranous 
glomerulonephritis of the renal allograft in one case and hypersensitivity interstitial nephritis in the 
other. 
A few cases of Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome on elbows have been reported in children chronically 
treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations (cysteamine chlorhydrate or cystamine or 
cysteamine bitartrate) mostly above the maximal dose 1.95 g/m2/day. In some cases, these skin lesions 
were associated with skin striae and bone lesions first seen during an X-ray examination. Bone 
disorders reported were genu valgum, leg pain and hyperextensive joints, osteopenia, compression 
fractures, and scoliosis. In the few cases where histopathological examination of the skin was 
performed, the results suggested angioendotheliomatosis. One patient subsequently died of acute 
cerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy. In some patients, the skin lesions on elbows regressed 
after immediate-release cysteamine dose reduction (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
An overdose of cysteamine may cause progressive lethargy. 
Should overdosing occur, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be supported 
appropriately. No specific antidote is known. It is not known if cysteamine is removed by 
haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism product, amino acids and 
derivatives, ATC code: A16AA04. 
Cysteamine is the simplest stable aminothiol and a degradation product of the amino acid cysteine. 
Cysteamine participates within lysosomes in a thiol-disulfide interchange reaction converting cystine 
into cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfide, both of which can exit the lysosome in patients 
with cystinosis. 
Normal individuals and persons heterozygous for cystinosis have white blood cell cystine levels of 
< 0.2 and usually below 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein, respectively, when measured using the mixed 
leukocyte assay. Individuals with cystinosis have elevations of WBC cystine above 
2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein.  
WBC cystine is monitored in these patients to determine adequacy of dosing, levels being measured 
30 minutes after dosing when treated with PROCYSBI.  
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A pivotal phase 3 randomised, crossover PK and PD study (which was also the first ever randomised 
study with immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate) demonstrated that at steady-state, patients 
receiving PROCYSBI every 12 hours (Q12H) maintained a comparable depletion of WBC cystine 
levels compared to immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate every 6 hours (Q6H). Forty-three (43) 
patients were randomised; twenty-seven (27) children (ages 6 to 12 years old), fifteen (15) adolescents 
(ages 12 to 21 years old) and one (1) adult with cystinosis and with native kidney function based on an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (corrected for body surface area) > 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 
were randomised. Of those forty-three (43) patients, two (2) siblings withdrew at the end of the first 
crossover period, due to a prior planned surgery in one (1) of them; forty-one (41) patients completed 
the protocol. Two (2) patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis because their WBC 
cystine level increased over 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein during the immediate-release cysteamine 
treatment period. Thirty-nine (39) patients were included in the final primary per protocol efficacy 
analysis.

Forty of forty-one (40/41) patients who completed the pivotal phase 3 study were entered in a 
prospective study with PROCYSBI that stayed open as long as PROCYSBI could not be prescribed by 
their treating physician. In this study, the WBC cystine measured using the mixed leukocyte assay was 
always on average under optimal control at < 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein. The estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not change for the study population over time.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The relative bioavailability is about 125% as compared to immediate-release cysteamine. 
Food intake reduces the absorption of PROCYSBI at 30 minutes pre-dose (approximately 35% 
decrease in exposure) and at 30 min post-dose (approximately 16 or 45% decrease in exposure for 
intact and open capsules respectively). Food intake two hours after administration did not affect the 
absorption of PROCYSBI.  
Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of cysteamine, primarily to albumin, is approximately 54% and 
independent of plasma drug concentration over the therapeutic range.  
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
The elimination of unchanged cysteamine in the urine has been shown to range between 0.3% and 
1.7% of the total daily dose in four patients; the bulk of cysteamine is excreted as sulphate. 
In vitro data suggests that cysteamine bitartrate is likely to be metabolised by multiple CYP enzymes, 
including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP2A6 and 
CYP3A4 were not involved in the metabolism of cysteamine bitartrate under the experimental 
conditions.  
Elimination 
The terminal half-life of cysteamine bitartrate is approximately 4 hours.  
Cysteamine bitartrate is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in vitro. 
In vitro: Cysteamine bitartrate is a substrate of P-gp and OCT2, but not a substrate of BCRP, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT1. Cysteamine bitartrate is not an inhibitor of OAT1, 
OAT3 and OCT2.  
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetics of cysteamine bitartrate has not been studied in special populations.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In genotoxicity studies published for cysteamine, induction of chromosome aberrations in cultured 
eukaryotic cell lines has been reported. Specific studies with cysteamine did not show any mutagenic 
effects in the Ames test or any clastogenic effect in the mouse micronucleus test. A bacterial reverse 
mutation assay study (“Ames test”) was performed with the cysteamine bitartrate used for PROCYSBI 
and cysteamine bitartrate did not show any mutagenic effects in this test. 
Reproduction studies showed embryo-foetotoxic effects (resorptions and post-implantation losses) in 
rats at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level and in rabbits receiving cysteamine 50 mg/kg/day. Teratogenic 
effects have been described in rats when cysteamine is administered over the period of organogenesis 
at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day. 
This is equivalent to 0.6 g/m2/day in the rat, which is slightly less than the recommended clinical 
maintenance dose of cysteamine, i.e. 1.3 g/m2/day. A reduction of fertility was observed in rats at 
375 mg/kg/day, a dose at which body weight gain was retarded. At this dose, weight gain and survival 
of the offspring during lactation was also reduced. High doses of cysteamine impair the ability of 
lactating mothers to feed their pups. Single doses of the drug inhibit prolactin secretion in animals. 
Administration of cysteamine in neonate rats induced cataracts. 
High doses of cysteamine, either by oral or parenteral routes, produce duodenal ulcers in rats and mice 
but not in monkeys. Experimental administration of the drug causes depletion of somatostatin in 
several animal species. The consequence of this for the clinical use of the drug is unknown. 
No carcinogenic studies have been conducted with cysteamine bitartrate gastro-resistant hard capsules.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Handling 
Each sachet is for single use only. 
Sprinkling on food 
Sachets for either the morning or evening dose should be opened and the contents sprinkled onto 
approximately 100 grams of apple sauce or fruit jam. Gently stir the contents into the soft food, 
creating a mixture of cysteamine granules and food. The entire amount of the mixture should be eaten. 
This may be followed by 250 mL of an acceptable acidic liquid - fruit juice (e.g., orange juice or any 
acidic fruit juice) or water. The mixture must be eaten within 2 hours after preparation and may be 
refrigerated from the time of preparation to the time of administration. 
Administering through feeding tubes 
Sachets for either the morning or evening dose should be opened and the contents sprinkled onto 
approximately 100 grams of apple sauce or fruit jam. Gently stir the contents into the soft food, 
creating a mixture of cysteamine granules and the soft food. The mixture should then be administered 
via gastrostomy tube, nasogastric tube or gastrostomy-jejunostomy tube using a catheter tip syringe. 
Before PROCYSBI administration: Unclasp the G-tube button and attach the feeding tube. Flush with 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 mL of water to clear the button. Draw the mixture up into the syringe. A maximum 60 mL mixture 
volume in a catheter tip syringe is recommended for use with a straight or bolus feeding tube. Place 
the opening of the syringe containing the PROCYSBI/apple sauce/fruit jam mixture into the opening 
of the feeding tube and fill completely with the mixture: pressing gently on the syringe and keeping 
the feeding tube horizontal during administration can help to avoid clogging issues. Using a viscous 
food such as apple sauce or fruit jam at a rate of about 10 mL every 10 seconds until the syringe is 
completely empty is also suggested to avoid clogging. Repeat the above step until all of the mixture is 
given. After PROCYSBI administration, draw 10 mL of fruit juice or water up into another syringe 
and flush the G-tube ensuring that none of the applesauce/fruit jam and granules mixture gets stuck on 
the G-tube. The mixture must be administered within 2 hours after preparation and may be refrigerated 
from the time of preparation to the time of administration. Nothing of the mixture should be saved. 
Sprinkling in orange juice or any acidic fruit juice or water 
Sachets for either the morning or evening dose should be opened and the contents sprinkled into 
100 to 150 mL of acidic fruit juice or water. Dose administration options are provided below:  
• 
Option 1/Syringe: Mix gently for 5 minutes, then aspirate the mixture of cysteamine granules 
and acidic fruit juice or water into a dosing syringe. 
Option 2/Cup: Mix gently for 5 minutes in a cup or shake gently for 5 minutes in a covered cup 
(e.g., “sippy” cup). Drink the mixture of cysteamine granules and acidic fruit juice or water. 
The mixture must be administered (drunk) within 30 minutes after preparation and may be refrigerated 
from the time of preparation to the time of administration. 
• 
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What PROCYSBI is and what it is used for 
PROCYSBI contains the active substance cysteamine (also known as mercaptamine) and is taken for 
the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in children and adults. Cystinosis is a disease affecting how 
the body functions, with an abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine in various organs of the 
body such as the kidney, eye, muscle, pancreas, and brain. Cystine build-up causes kidney damage and 
excretion of excess amounts of glucose, proteins, and electrolytes. Different organs are affected at 
different ages. 
PROCYSBI is a medicine that reacts with cystine to decrease its level within the cells. Cysteamine 
therapy should be initiated promptly after confirmation of the diagnosis of cystinosis to achieve 
maximum benefit. 
2.  What you need to know before you take PROCYSBI 
Do not take PROCYSBI 
− 
If you are allergic to cysteamine (also known as mercaptamine) or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you are allergic to penicillamine (this is not “penicillin”, but a medicine used for the treatment 
of Wilson’s disease). 
If you are breast-feeding. 
− 
− 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking PROCYSBI. 
− 
Since oral cysteamine doesn’t prevent deposits of cystine crystals in the eye, you should 
continue taking cysteamine eye drops as prescribed by your doctor.  
−  Whole cysteamine capsules should not be given to children under the age of 6 years due to the 
risk of choking (refer to section 3 “How to take PROCYSBI – Method of administration”).

Serious skin lesions can occur in patients treated with high doses of cysteamine. Your doctor 
will routinely monitor your skin and bones and reduce or stop your treatment if needed (see 
section 4). 
Stomach and intestinal ulcers and bleeding can occur in patients receiving cysteamine (see 
section 4).  
Other intestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and stomach ache can occur 
with cysteamine. Your doctor may interrupt and change your dose if these occur.  
Talk to your doctor if you have any unusual stomach symptoms or changes in stomach 
symptoms. 
Symptoms such as seizures, tiredness, sleepiness, depression, and brain disorders 
(encephalopathy) can occur with cysteamine. If such symptoms develop, tell your doctor who 
will adjust your dose. 
Abnormal liver function or reduced white blood cell count (leukopenia) can occur with use of 
cysteamine. Your doctor will routinely monitor your blood counts and liver function. 
Your doctor will monitor you for benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri 
[PTC]) and/or swelling of the optic nerve (papilledema) associated with cysteamine treatment. 
You will receive regular eye examinations to identify this condition as early treatment can 
prevent vision loss. 
Other medicines and PROCYSBI 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. If your doctor prescribes bicarbonate, do not take it at the same time as PROCYSBI; take 
bicarbonate at least one hour before or at least one hour after the medicine. 
PROCYSBI with food and drink 
For at least 1 hour before and 1 hour after taking PROCYSBI try to avoid meals, which are rich in fat 
or proteins as well as any food or liquid that could decrease the acidity in your stomach, like milk or 
yogurt. If this is not possible, you can eat a small amount (about 100 grams) of food (preferably 
carbohydrates e.g. bread, pasta, fruits) during the hour before and after taking PROCYSBI.  
Take the capsule with an acidic drink (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) or water. For children 
and patients who have problems to swallow, please refer to section 3 “How to take PROCYSBI – 
Method of administration”. 
Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
You should not use this medicine if you are pregnant, particularly during the first trimester. Before 
starting the treatment, you should have a pregnancy test with negative result, while during the course 
of treatment you should use an adequate method of contraception. If you are a woman planning a 
pregnancy or become pregnant, seek immediate advice from your doctor about stopping therapy with 
this medicine as continued treatment may be harmful to the unborn baby.  
Do not use this medicine if you are breastfeeding (see section 2 under “Do not take PROCYSBI”).

How to take PROCYSBI 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose for you or your child will depend on your or your child’s age and weight. The 
targeted maintenance dose is 1.3 g/m2/day. 
Dosing schedule 
Take this medicine two times a day, every 12 hours. To get the most benefit from this medicine, try to 
avoid meals and dairy products for at least 1 hour before and 1 hour after PROCYSBI dosing. If this is 
not possible, you can eat a small amount (about 100 grams) of food (preferably carbohydrates e.g. 
bread, pasta, fruits) during the hour before and after PROCYSBI administration.  
It is important to take PROCYSBI in a consistent way over time. 
Do not increase or decrease the amount of medicine without your doctor’s approval. 
The total usual dose should not exceed 1.95 g/m2/day. 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment with PROCYSBI should continue life-long, as instructed by your doctor. 
Method of administration 
You should take this medicine only by mouth. 
In order for this medicine to work correctly, you must do the following: 
- 
For patients who can swallow the whole capsule: 
Swallow the whole capsule with an acidic drink (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) or 
water. Do not crush or chew capsules or capsule contents. Children under 6 years of age may 
not be able to swallow gastro-resistant hard capsules and may choke them. You can give 
PROCYSBI to children under 6 years of age by opening the capsules and sprinkling the 
contents on food or liquid, as per the instructions given below.  
For patients who cannot swallow the whole capsule or who use a feeding tube: 
Sprinkling on food 
Open the gastro-resistant hard capsules and sprinkle the contents (granules) onto approximately 
100 grams of food such as apple sauce or fruit jam. 
Gently stir the granules into the soft food, creating a mixture of granules and food. Eat the entire 
mixture. Then drink about 250 mL of an acidic drink (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) 
or water to ease the swallowing of the mixture. 
If you don’t eat the mixture immediately, you may refrigerate (2°C-8°C) it from the time of 
preparation to the time of administration and eat it within 2 hours of preparation. Nothing of the 
mixture should be saved beyond 2 hours. 
Administering through feeding tube 
Open the gastro-resistant hard capsules and sprinkle the contents (granules) onto approximately 
100 grams of apple sauce or fruit jam. Gently stir the granules into the soft food, creating a 
mixture of granules and the soft food. Administer the mixture by gastrostomy tube, nasogastric 
tube or gastrostomy jejunostomy tube using a catheter tip syringe. Before PROCYSBI 
administration: Unclasp the G-tube button and attach the feeding tube. Flush with 5 mL of water 
to clear the button. Draw the mixture up into the syringe. A maximum 60 mL mixture volume in 
a catheter tip syringe is recommended for use with a straight or bolus feeding tube. Place the 
opening of the syringe containing the PROCYSBI and food mixture into the opening of the 
feeding tube and fill completely with the mixture: pressing gently on the syringe and keeping 
the feeding tube horizontal during administration can help to avoid clogging issues. Using a 
viscous food such as apple sauce or fruit jam at a rate of about 10 mL every 10 seconds until the 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
syringe is completely empty is suggested to avoid clogging. Repeat the above step until all of 
the mixture is given. After PROCYSBI administration, draw 10 mL of fruit juice or water up 
into another syringe and flush the G-tube ensuring that none of the PROCYSBI and food 
mixture gets stuck in the G-tube. 
If you don’t consume the mixture immediately, you may refrigerate (2°C-8°C) it from the time 
of preparation to the time of administration and consume it within 2 hours of preparation. 
Nothing of the mixture should be saved beyond 2 hours. 
Consult your child’s doctor for complete instructions on how to properly administer the product 
through feeding tubes and if you experience clogging issues. 
Sprinkling in orange juice or any acidic fruit juice or water 
Open the gastro-resistant hard capsules and sprinkle the contents (granules) into about 100 to 
150 mL of acidic fruit juice (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) or water. Mix the 
PROCYSBI drink mixture gently for 5 minutes, either mixing in a cup or shaking in a covered 
cup (e.g., “sippy” cup) and drink the mixture.  
If you don’t drink the mixture immediately, you may refrigerate (2°C-8°C) it from the time of 
preparation to the time of administration and drink it within 30 minutes after preparation. 
Nothing of the mixture should be saved beyond 30 minutes. 
Administering a drink mixture by oral syringe 
Aspirate the drink mixture into a dosing syringe and administer it into the mouth directly. 
If you don’t consume the mixture immediately, you may refrigerate (2°C-8°C) it from the time 
of preparation to the time of administration and consume it within 30 minutes after preparation. 
Nothing of the mixture should be saved beyond 30 minutes. 
Your doctor may recommend or prescribe to include, in addition to cysteamine, one or more 
supplements to replace important electrolytes lost through the kidneys. It is important to take these 
supplements exactly as instructed. If several doses of the supplements are missed or weakness or 
drowsiness develops, call your doctor for instructions. 
Regular blood tests to measure the amount of cystine inside white blood cells and/or the concentration 
of cysteamine in the blood are necessary to help determine the correct dose of PROCYSBI. You or 
your doctor will arrange for these blood tests to be performed. These tests must be obtained 12.5 hours 
after the evening dose the day before, and therefore 30 minutes after the following morning dose is 
given. Regular blood and urine tests to measure the levels of the body’s important electrolytes are also 
necessary to help you or your doctor correctly adjust the doses of these supplements. 
If you take more PROCYSBI than you should 
You should contact your doctor or the hospital emergency department immediately if you have taken 
more PROCYSBI than you should. You may become drowsy. 
If you forget to take PROCYSBI 
If you missed a dose of medicine, you should take it as soon as possible. However, if it is within 
4 hours of the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule.  
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What PROCYSBI is and what it is used for 
PROCYSBI contains the active substance cysteamine (also known as mercaptamine) and is taken for 
the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in children and adults. Cystinosis is a disease affecting how 
the body functions, with an abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine in various organs of the 
body such as the kidney, eye, muscle, pancreas, and brain. Cystine build-up causes kidney damage and 
excretion of excess amounts of glucose, proteins, and electrolytes. Different organs are affected at 
different ages. 
PROCYSBI is a medicine that reacts with cystine to decrease its level within the cells. Cysteamine 
therapy should be initiated promptly after confirmation of the diagnosis of cystinosis to achieve 
maximum benefit. 
2.  What you need to know before you take PROCYSBI 
Do not take PROCYSBI 
− 
If you are allergic to cysteamine (also known as mercaptamine) or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you are allergic to penicillamine (this is not “penicillin”, but a medicine used for the treatment 
of Wilson’s disease). 
If you are breast-feeding. 
− 
− 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking PROCYSBI. 
− 
− 
Since oral cysteamine doesn’t prevent deposits of cystine crystals in the eye, you should 
continue taking cysteamine eye drops as prescribed by your doctor. 
Serious skin lesions can occur in patients treated with high doses of cysteamine. Your doctor 
will routinely monitor your skin and bones and reduce or stop your treatment if needed (see 
section 4). 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Stomach and intestinal ulcers and bleeding can occur in patients receiving cysteamine (see 
section 4).  
Other intestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and stomach ache can occur 
with cysteamine. Your doctor may interrupt and change your dose if these occur.  
Talk to your doctor if you have any unusual stomach symptoms or changes in stomach 
symptoms. 
Symptoms such as seizures, tiredness, sleepiness, depression, and brain disorders 
(encephalopathy) can occur with cysteamine. If such symptoms develop, tell your doctor who 
will adjust your dose. 
Abnormal liver function or reduced white blood cell count (leukopenia) can occur with use of 
cysteamine. Your doctor will routinely monitor your blood counts and liver function. 
Your doctor will monitor you for benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri 
[PTC]) and/or swelling of the optic nerve (papilledema) associated with cysteamine treatment. 
You will receive regular eye examinations to identify this condition as early treatment can 
prevent vision loss. 
Other medicines and PROCYSBI 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. If your doctor prescribes bicarbonate, do not take it at the same time as PROCYSBI; take 
bicarbonate at least one hour before or at least one hour after the medicine. 
PROCYSBI with food and drink 
For at least 1 hour before and 1 hour after taking PROCYSBI try to avoid meals, which are rich in fat 
or proteins as well as any food or liquid that could decrease the acidity in your stomach, like milk or 
yogurt. If this is not possible, you can eat a small amount (about 100 grams) of food (preferably 
carbohydrates e.g. bread, pasta, fruits) during the hour before and after taking PROCYSBI.  
See also section 3 “How to take PROCYSBI - Method of Administration”. 
Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
You should not use this medicine if you are pregnant, particularly during the first trimester. Before 
starting the treatment, you should have a pregnancy test with negative result, while during the course 
of treatment you should use an adequate method of contraception. If you are a woman planning a 
pregnancy or become pregnant, seek immediate advice from your doctor about stopping therapy with 
this medicine as continued treatment may be harmful to the unborn baby.  
Do not use this medicine if you are breastfeeding (see section 2 under “Do not take PROCYSBI”).  
Driving and using machines 
This medicine may cause some drowsiness. When starting therapy, you should not drive, use 
machines, or engage in other dangerous activities until you know how the medicine affects you.

EPAR summary for the public 
CellCept 
mycophenolate mofetil 
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for CellCept. It explains how the 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the medicine to reach its opinion in 
favour of granting a marketing authorisation and its recommendations on the conditions of use for 
CellCept. 
What is CellCept? 
CellCept is a medicine containing the active substance mycophenolate mofetil. It is available as 
capsules (250 mg), tablets (500 mg), a powder to be made up into an oral suspension (1 g/5 ml) and 
a powder to be made up into a solution for infusion (drip) into a vein (500 mg). 
What is CellCept used for? 
CellCept is used to prevent the body from rejecting a transplanted kidney, heart or liver. It is used with 
ciclosporin and corticosteroids (other medicines used to prevent organ rejection). 
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription. 
How is CellCept used? 
CellCept treatment should be initiated and maintained by a qualified transplant specialist. 
The way that CellCept should be given and the dose depend on the type of organ transplant and the 
patient’s age and size. 
For kidney transplants, the recommended dose in adults is 1 g twice a day by mouth (capsules, tablets 
or oral suspension) starting within 72 hours after the transplant. It can also be given as an infusion 
lasting two hours starting within 24 hours after the transplant, for up to 14 days. In children aged

between two and 18 years, the dose of CellCept is calculated depending on height and weight and 
should be given by mouth. 
For heart transplants, the recommended adult dose is 1.5 g twice a day by mouth, starting within five 
days following the transplant. 
For liver transplants in adults, CellCept should be given as a 1-g infusion twice a day for the first four 
days after the transplant, before the patient is switched to 1.5 g twice a day by mouth as soon as it 
can be tolerated.  
The dose may need to be adjusted in patients with liver or kidney disease. For more information, see 
the summary of product characteristics (also part of the EPAR). 
How does CellCept work? 
The active substance in CellCept, mycophenolate mofetil, is an immunosuppressive medicine. In the 
body, it is converted into mycophenolic acid, which blocks an enzyme called ‘inosine monophosphate 
dehydrogenase’. This enzyme is important for the formation of DNA in cells, particularly in the 
lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell which is involved in the rejection of organ transplants). By 
preventing the production of new DNA, CellCept reduces the rate at which the lymphocytes multiply. 
This makes them less effective at recognising and attacking the transplanted organ, lowering the risk 
of the organ being rejected. 
How has CellCept been studied? 
CellCept capsules and tablets have been studied in three studies involving a total of 1,493 adults 
following kidney transplant, in one study involving 650 adults following heart transplant and in one 
study involving 565 adults following liver transplant. CellCept was compared with azathioprine (another 
anti-rejection medicine) in all studies except for one of the kidney transplant studies, in which it was 
compared with placebo (a dummy treatment). A further study looked at the effect of CellCept oral 
suspension in 100 children following a kidney transplant. In all of the studies, all of the patients also 
received ciclosporin and corticosteroids, and the main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of 
patients whose new organ had been rejected after six months. 
Further studies showed that the solution for infusion and the oral suspension produced similar levels of 
the active substance in the blood as the capsules. 
What benefit has CellCept shown during the studies? 
CellCept was as effective as azathioprine and more effective than placebo in preventing the rejection of 
transplanted kidneys after six months. In children undergoing kidney transplants, the rejection rates 
were similar to those seen in adults taking CellCept and lower than those seen in other studies of 
children who did not receive CellCept. 
In the heart transplant study, around 38% of adult patients taking CellCept and those taking 
azathioprine experienced rejection after six months. Following liver transplant, 38% of the adult 
patients taking CellCept had rejected their new liver after six months, compared with 48% of those 
taking azathioprine, but the proportion of patients who had lost their new liver after a year was similar 
in the two groups, at around 4%.

What is the risk associated with CellCept? 
The most serious risk associated with CellCept is the possible development of cancer, particularly 
lymphoma and skin cancer. The most common side effects with CellCept used in combination with 
ciclosporin and corticosteroids (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are sepsis (blood infection), 
gastrointestinal candidiasis (a fungal infection of the stomach or gut), urinary tract infection (infection 
of the structures that carry urine), herpes simplex (a viral infection that causes cold sores), herpes 
zoster (a viral infection that causes chickenpox and shingles), leucopenia (low white blood cell counts), 
thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), vomiting, 
abdominal (tummy) pain, diarrhoea and nausea (feeling sick). For the full list of side effects reported 
with CellCept, see the package leaflet. 
It has been shown that there is a significant risk of harm to a developing baby and of miscarriage if 
CellCept is used in pregnancy. Therefore, CellCept must not be used during pregnancy unless there is 
no suitable alternative to prevent rejection of the transplant. Women able to have children should be 
tested before starting treatment to ensure that they are not pregnant. Both men and women must use 
highly effective contraception before, during and for a suitable period after CellCept treatment. Women 
must not breastfeed while using CellCept and patients should not donate blood or sperm during 
treatment or for a period afterwards. For full details of the restrictions with CellCept, see the package 
leaflet. 
Why has CellCept been approved? 
The CHMP decided that CellCept’s benefits are greater than its risks and recommended that it be given 
marketing authorisation. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
CellCept? 
The company that markets CellCept will provide educational materials for patients and healthcare 
professionals explaining the risk of harm to a developing baby and the precautions and measures to be 
taken to avoid pregnancy during treatment. There will also be very close monitoring of the outcomes of 
any accidentally exposed pregnancies. 
Safety information has also been included in the summary of product characteristics and the package 
leaflet for CellCept, including the appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals 
and patients.

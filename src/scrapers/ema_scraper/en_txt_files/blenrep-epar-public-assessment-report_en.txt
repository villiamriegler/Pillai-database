Cys-mcMMAF  has  limited  metabolic  clearance.  In  vitro  (rat,  monkey,  human)  and  in  vivo  (rats),  the 
linear isomer of cys-mcMMAF was predominately chemically hydrolysed and dehydrated to the cyclized

sum of the linear and cyclized isomers that are measured in the bioanalytical assay for cys-mcMMAF.

The DREAMM-2 study included an additional independent cohort 24 additional participants who 
received a lyophilized presentation of belantamab mafodotin at 3.4 mg/kg. 
Based on available data, the ORR by IRC assessment was numerically higher in the Lyo cohort (48%) 
than in the frozen cohort (34%). A total of 24% of participants achieved VGPR or better; this was 
similar to the frozen cohort (20%).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The justification for the selected two doses (2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg) of belantamab mafodotin was 
based on the results of the dose-finding study BMA117159 (DREAMM-1). The DLTs were investigated 
in the Part 1 of the study and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed at any dose level, including the

In the pooled (DREAMM-2 and DREAMM-1) 2.5 mg/kg cohort, 22 (21%) of the 103 patients were ongoing 
and  receiving  study  treatment  at  data  cut-off  (21  June  2019).  The  most  common  reason  for 
discontinuation  was  progressive  disease  (65  patients,  63%).  Eight  patients  (8%)  discontinued  due  to 
AEs.  Overall,  the  discontinuation  rates  were  very  similar  in  2.5 mg/kg  pooled  group  and  3.4  mg/kg

Immunogenicity assessment 
Serum samples for immunogenicity assessment were collected on day 1 of cycles 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 
16, on day 15 of cycle 1 and at the end of study in study DREAMM-1, and on day 1 of cycles 1, 2, 3, 6, 
9, 12, and on every 6 cycles thereafter until end of treatment in study DREAMM-2. 
In study DREAMM-1, all patients tested negative for ADAs both at baseline and in all assessments after 
treatment.  In  study  DREAMM-2,  5/211  patients  tested  positive  for  anti-belantamab  mafodotin  ADAs, 
with one patient testing positive for NAbs at baseline. Only one of these patients tested positive after 
treatment. A total of 2 patients tested positive for ADAs at a single time point after treatment with one 
patient testing positive for NAbs. Thus, 1/274 patients with post-baseline ADA results had treatment-
emergent ADAs. All antibody titers were close to sensitivity limit of the assay.

The applicant declared that belantamab mafodotin has not been previously authorised in a medicinal

The CHMP, based on the available data, considers belantamab mafodotin to be a new active substance

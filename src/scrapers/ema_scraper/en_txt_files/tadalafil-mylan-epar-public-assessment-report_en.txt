2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Tadalafil Mylan is a generic medicinal product of Cialis which has been authorised in the EU since 12 November 
2002. 
The active substance of Tadalafil Mylan is tadalafil, a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local 
release of nitric oxide, inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus 
cavernosum. This results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby 
Assessment report  
EMA/707959/2014 
Page 6/26 
 
  
  
 
producing an erection. Tadalafil has no effect in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in the absence of sexual 
stimulation. It is classified in the pharmaco-therapeutic group of Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, 
with ATC Code G04BE08. 
The safety and efficacy profile of tadalafil has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of which can be 
found in the EPAR for Cialis. In addition, there is extensive post-marketing experience contributing to the 
knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic application referring to the 
reference medicinal product Cialis, summary of the clinical data of tadalafil is available and no new clinical 
studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted. 
Tadalafil Mylan is administered orally and its bioequivalence versus the reference product Cialis was 
demonstrated in two bioequivalence studies. The studies were performed in healthy male volunteers, with 20 
mg dose in fed and fasting condition. 
The approved indication is:  
For 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg: 
Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. 
In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. 
Tadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women. 
For 5 mg: 
Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. 
In order for tadalafil to be effective for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation is required. 
Treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adult males. 
Tadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women. 
The indication proposed for Tadalafil Mylan is the same as authorized for the reference medicinal product. The 
proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of tadalafil is (6R-trans)-6-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)- 
2,3,6,7,12,12a-hexahydro-2-methyl-pyrazino [1', 2':1,6] pyrido[3,4-b]indole-1,4-dione. 
The active substance is a white or almost white powder which is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in 
dimethyl sulfoxide and slightly soluble in methylene chloride.  
As there is a monograph of tadalafil in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active substance 
has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for tadalafil which has been 
provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. monograph.  
Additional specifications have been set for methanol, acetone and DMF residual solvents, safrole, chloroacetyl 
and chloroacetyl chloride impurities (included in the CEP) as well as for methylene chloride, isopropyl ether, 
toluene, triethylamine residual solvents and particle size (not included in the CEP). The analytical method for 
particle size has been adequately validated and it was demonstrated that it is not a critical factor for either the 
finished product performance or the manufacturing process. 
Batch analysis data on three batches of the active substance were provided. The results comply with the 
specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of the manufacturing process. 
Stability 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product Tadalafil Mylan film-coated tablets was developed as a generic bioequivalent to Cialis by Eli 
Lilly Nederland B.V. from the European market. The formulation contains the active substance tadalafil, officially 
listed in the Ph. Eur. Tadalafil is a white or almost white powder, practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in 
DMSO and slightly soluble in methylene chloride. The excipients selected for the formulation development are 
based on literature survey, excipient compatibility studies and their functionality for development of a tablet 
dosage form. All of the excipients are conventional pharmaceutical ingredients that comply with the respective 
requirements of the Ph. Eur., with the exception of the film coating agent Opadry II yellow which complies with 
Assessment report  
EMA/707959/2014 
Page 8/26 
 
  
  
Commission Regulation (EU) No. 231/2012. However, the individual components of the coating material are of 
Ph.Eur. or similar quality. 
The formulation should have the following attributes: the product should be formulated as an immediate release 
tablets and it has to be pharmaceutically equivalent to the reference product, the formulation should have 
comparable dissolution profile with reference product and the product should have satisfactory pharmaceutical 
stability. 
Prototype development was initiated with a weight proportional composition for Tadalafil 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg 
film coated tablets. As the active substance exhibits poor flow properties, a wet granulation process was selected 
for prototype formulation development. 
The dissolution characteristics of the finished product (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg tablets) were compared 
to the reference medicinal product Cialis from the European market (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg tablets). 
The dissolution profiles in water resulted in a release > 85% after 15 minutes for all strengths of the test product. 
However, in 0.1 N HCl, acetate buffer pH 4.5 and phosphate buffer pH 6.8 without the addition of a surfactant, 
the dissolution is generally incomplete for all strengths of the test and reference products. Since the 20 mg 
strength of the test product has been demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the reference product Cialis of the 
same strength, the incomplete release observed in the in-vitro dissolution studies was not raised as an issue. 
The formulation used in the clinical studies is the same as the formulation intended for commercial supply. 
Furthermore, the applicant confirmed that the manufacturing process as described in the dossier was followed 
in the manufacturing of Tadalafil 20 mg film coated tables used in the bioequivalence study, manufacturing 
process validation and stability studies. 
A biowaiver for the lower 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg strengths on the basis of the successful “fed” and “fasting” 
bioequivalence studies conducted on the 20 mg strength was applied. The conditions for granting a biowaiver 
were  considered  fulfilled  and  no  further  bioequivalence  studies  for  the  lower  strengths  were  considered 
necessary.  
The manufacturing process development strategy was to design and develop stable and bioequivalent generic 
product of Tadalafil film coated tablets using commonly used excipients and similar to the reference product. As 
mentioned above, the active substance characterization has revealed that the active substance had poor flow 
properties. Therefore a wet granulation process was chosen. During development the manufacturing process 
was optimized with regard to the following parameters: solvent system for granulation, drying temperature, 
milling process, blending time, tableting speed and hardness. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PE/PVdC-Alu blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. 
The choice of container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use 
of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The product is manufactured using a wet granulation process. The manufacturing process consists of 11 main 
steps: dispensing, sifting, granulation and drying, milling, mixing of granules, sifting, blending, compression, 
coating, inspection and packaging. All four strengths (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg film-coated tablets) are 
being  produced  from  the  same  common  blend.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing 
process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707959/2014 
Page 9/26 
 
  
  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, 
identification  (UV,  IR),  color  identification,  dissolution  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (by  content 
uniformity), assay (UV), related substances (HPLC), loss on drying, residual solvents (GC), and microbiological 
test (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  three  commercial  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of twenty commercial scale  batches (5 of each strength) of finished product stored under long 
term conditions for 12 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC 
/ 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal product are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, dissolution, assay, related substances, loss on drying and microbiological 
quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used 
to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant 
material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and the finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant is applying for a biowaiver for the three 
lower strength tablets (2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg), which is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707959/2014 
Page 10/26 
 
  
  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Tadalafil Mylan manufactured by Generics [UK] Limited is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all tadalafil containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
This is an article 10(1) generic application. All non-clinical aspects have been covered in the SmPC, there are no 
objections according to the CHMP to grant a marketing authorisation for Tadalafil Mylan. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view there are no objections according to the CHMP to approve Tadalafil Mylan. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing tadalafil. To support the marketing authorisation 
application the applicant conducted two bioequivalence study which was open label, balanced,

Page 11/26 
 
  
  
laboratory-blinded, randomised, single dose, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period, two-way crossover 
oral bioequivalence study comparing two different formulations of Tadalafil 20 mg film-coated tablets  in healthy, 
adult, human male subjects under fasting conditions.. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference product. This is agreeable to the CHMP.  
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 
1/ Corr.) as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09 Rev.1 Corr.) 
are of particular relevance.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Exemption  
Two bioequivalence studies were conducted on the 20 mg film-coated tablet strength under fasting and fed 
conditions.  
To fulfil the requirements of a biowaiver an updated in vitro dissolution data was submitted at three pH levels 
without the addition of surfactant into the dissolution media.  
The results of studies TADA-1K-622-13 and TADA-1937-13 with 20 mg formulation CAN be extrapolated to 
other strengths 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg, according to conditions in Guideline on the Investigation of

Biowaiver justification for Tadalafil 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg film coated tablets 
The selection of the dose, 20 mg, used in the bioequivalence studies is justified and according to guidelines. 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr 
–effective since 1st August 2010), Tadalafil 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg film coated tablets satisfy the conditions for 
waiver of bioequivalence studies conducted on Tadalafil 20 mg film coated tablets as discussed below: 
-All the strengths of Tadalafil film coated tablets are manufactured by the same manufacturer at the same 
manufacturing site using similar manufacturing process. 
-The qualitative composition of core tablets of Tadalafil 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg film coated tablets is the 
same. 
-Tadalafil tablets 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg are direct scale up/scale down formulations and the ratio 
between the amounts of each excipient to the amount of the active substance is the same. 
-The in vitro dissolution characteristics demonstrates that dissolution profiles of Tadalafil 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg 
and 20 mg film coated tablets of Mylan Laboratories Limited’s are similar across the physiological pH range i.e. 
pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8. 
More than 85% of the labelled amount of drug (Tadalafil) was released within 15 minutes from the batches of 
bioequivalence study strength i.e. Tadalafil 20 mg film coated tablets and the lower strengths of the test product 
i.e. Tadalafil 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg film coated tablets in all the dissolution media tested. Therefore as per the 
provisions mentioned in CHMP Guideline on the Investigation of Bio-equivalence – 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98-Rev 01 Corr–effective since 1 August 2010, the dissolution profiles can be considered 
as similar. 
-As per Cialis SmPC, “Tadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects are linear with respect to time and dose. 
Over a dose range of 2.5 to 20 mg, exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose”. The bioequivalence 
study performed on Tadalafil 20 mg film coated tablets can therefore be extended to Tadalafil 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 
10 mg film coated tablets. 
Since all the requirements to waive bioequivalence studies as mentioned in CHMP Guideline on the Investigation 
of Bio-equivalence – CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98- Rev 01 Corr –are fulfilled, the bioequivalence study results of 
Tadalafil 20 mg film coated tablets can be extended to Tadalafil 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg film coated tablets.

Methods 
Study design  
The study was an open label, balanced, laboratory-blinded, randomised, single dose, two-treatment, 
two-sequence, two-period, two-way crossover oral bioequivalence study comparing two different formulations 
of Tadalafil 20 mg film-coated tablets  in healthy, adult, human male subjects under fasting conditions. The basis 
of the bioequivalence study under fasting conditions is justified and the study design is agreed by the CHMP. 
The applicant updated the first paragraph of section 2.5.6 of the clinical overview in Module 2.5 as requested and 
included information on the two bioequivalence studies submitted to support the application.  
After an overnight fasting of at least 10.00 hours, in the morning of each period, a single dose of either test or 
the reference Tadalafil 20 mg film-coated tablets as per the randomization schedule were administered orally 
with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature to the subjects. A standard meal was provided at around 04.00,

09.00 and 13.00 hours post-dose to all subjects. Water was restricted from at least 01.00 hr pre-dose until 
01.00 hr post dose except for water given during dosing. The subjects were housed in the clinical facility until 
24.00 hrs post dose in each period and returned to the clinical facility for the ambulatory blood draws. The 
washout period between the two periods of the study was 16 days. The wash-out period was adequate according 
to the CHMP, no pre-dose levels were detected. The study was conducted under standardised conditions. 
According to the CHMP, the sampling period was adequate and was more than 72 hrs. The AUC ratio was higher 
than 80% in all but two subjects with ratio 78% and 79%. The AUC0-t was calculated up to 144 hrs.    
The sampling scheme according to the CHMP was adequate to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. Tmax 
was not observed in any subject in the first sample time point.  A total of 23 blood samples were collected at 
specified time points: 00.00 hr (pre-dose), 00.50, 01.00, 01.50, 02.00, 02.50, 03.00, 03.50, 04.00, 04.50, 
05.00, 06.00, 08.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00, 72.00, 96.00, 120.00 and 144.00 hours post 
dose in labelled K3EDTA vaccutainers. Tadalafil was measured in human plasma.  
Safety was evaluated through assessment of adverse events, vital signs measurements, ECG, haematology and 
biochemistry.  
There were no changes in the conduct of the study. The listed protocol deviations did not have any significant 
impact on the outcome of the study this is agreed by the CHMP.

Tadalafil Mylan 20mg manufactured by Generics (UK) Limited (batch No.2001691, manufacturing date 
December 2012; exp. Date November 2014) has been compared to Cialis 20 mg manufactured by Lilly S.A., 
Avda, de la industria 30, 28108, Alcobendas, Madrid, Spain (Batch No: C073766, exp. date June 2015). 
Population studied   
The population is chosen according to guidelines. Tadalafil is only indicated for males and therefore only male 
subjects participated in the study.   
Thirty-one (31) healthy adult, human male subjects (18-45 years; BMI 19.13-29.74 kg/m2) of Asian origin were 
enrolled (inclusive of 01 standby subject). Out of 31 enrolled subjects, 30 subjects were randomized and 
participated in the study. The purpose of the standby subject was to ensure dosing of 30 subjects in period I of 
the study. There were no withdrawals prior to dosing and therefore the standby subject did not participate in the 
study. The intention was not to replace dosed subjects. The sample calculation is acceptable and the sample size 
is adequate. Twenty-seven (27) subjects completed both periods of the study and were included for 
pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.  
Subject no. S08 and S25 did not report to the facility for period II and S26 was withdrawn after dosing of period 
I due to failure in complying with restrictions and prohibitions.  
Analytical methods   
The bioanalytical method is acceptable according to the CHMP and was validated pre-study and within study. 
The method performance during study sample analysis was acceptable according to the CHMP. 
Validation 
The bioanalytical method validation report VR-117-00 is signed and dated 20 March 2013. Addendum-01-00 for 
long term stability of tadalafil in human plasma is signed and dated 24 June 2013.  
A specific LC/MS/MS method was validated for the determination of tadalafil concentrations in K3EDTA human 
plasma over a concentration range of 4.999 ng/ml to 599.878 ng/ml. Tadalafil was extracted from an aliquot of 
human plasma using solid phase extraction technique. The internal standard used was tadalafil-D3. Certificates 
of analysis of the test article (tadalafil) and the internal standard (tadalafil-D3) are provided. The quality control 
(QC) concentrations of tadalafil were 5.005 ng/ml, 16.016 ng/ml, 120.119 ng/ml, 220.219 ng/ml and 460.457 
ng/ml.  
The method was validated and met acceptance criteria with respect to specificity (including also haemolytic and 
lipemic lots) and  selectivity,  carry-over, sensitivity  (LLOQ= 4.999 ng/ml  tadalafil; signal to  noise  ratio  >5), 
linearity (r2≥0.9978), between-run and within-run precision and accuracy, recovery, dilution integrity (1/2 and 
1/4-fold), matrix effect (including also haemolytic and lipemic lots), ruggedness, re-injection reproducibility, 
short and long term stock and working solution stability of tadalafil and of the internal standard (tadalafil-D3), 
bench  top  stability  of  tadalafil  in  matrix,  coolant  stability  of  tadalafil  (in  matrix  in  dry  ice),  post  extracted 
refrigerator stability in matrix, dry extract stability, freeze-thaw stability of tadalafil and in-injector stability in 
autosampler. Long term stability of tadalafil in plasma at -70±15°C and at -20±5°C was approved for 101 days 
(Addendum-01-00). 
All integrations were performed by Applied Biosystems Analyst Software Version 1.5.1.

Bioanalysis 
The  bioanalytical  study  report  TADA-1K-622-13  is  signed  and  dated  17  July  2013.  Handling  of  samples  is 
adequate. There were a few missing samples in the later time points. The same anticoagulant was used during 
validation and study sample analysis. The samples were analysed from 5 to 14 June 2013, including repeats and 
incurred sample analysis.  
Blood  samples  were  centrifuged  at  4000  rpm  for  10  minutes  at  04°C  nominal  to  separate  the  plasma.  The 
plasma was stored in a freezer at a temperature -70°C±20°C until transferred to the bioanalytical facility where 
they  were  kept  at  -70±15°C  until  they  were  analysed.  The  plasma  samples  were  received  frozen  by  the 
bioanalytical facility. 
Tadalafil was extracted from an aliquot of human plasma using solid phase extraction technique. The internal 
standard used was tadalafil-D3. Certificates of analysis of the test article (tadalafil) and the internal standard 
(tadalafil-D3) are provided. A validated LC/MS/MS method was employed in determining sample concentrations 
of tadalafil in human plasma. The calibration curve range during study sample analysis was from 4.995 ng/ml to 
599.399 ng/ml  for tadalafil. The quality control  (QC)  sample concentrations of  tadalafil were 16.035 ng/ml, 
120.263 ng/ml, 220.482 ng/ml and 461.008 ng/ml.  
The longest storage period of the study samples was 58 days at temperature -70±15°C (18 April 2013 to 14 
June 2013).  
A total of 1289 samples were collected but 1229 samples were analysed from the 27 evaluable subjects. A total 
of 11 samples (0.9% of the total samples analysed) were repeated for tadalafil due to the following reasons, bad 
chromatography,  unacceptable  internal  standard  response,  sample  concentration  above  upper  limit  of 
quantitation, concentration/response in zero hours subject samples and due to processing error (no analyte 
response was observed). A total of 128 samples were included in the incurred sample reanalysis (ISR). A total 
of 127 samples were considered for ISR calculations and all of them meet acceptance criteria. The one sample 
that was not taken into account was an incorrect sample being processed and analysed. The ISR is acceptable 
according to the CHMP. Sample chromatograms for 20% of the subjects and for the discrete repeated samples 
are submitted.  
All integrations were performed by Applied Biosystems Analyst® Software Version 1.5.1.  
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The pharmacokinetic parameters for tadalafil were calculated using non-compartmental model of WinNonlin® 
software  version 5.3 of Pharsight Corporation,  USA  for both the formulations. The primary pharmacokinetic 
parameters were Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞, and the secondary pharmacokinetic parameters tmax, Kel, t1/2 and 
AUC0-t/AUC0-∞. Standard methods were used.  
Statistical methods   
The statistics is adequately described and the methods are acceptable.  The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were analysed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. Ratio analysis 
was  calculated  for  ln-transformed  Cmax,  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-∞  and  the  90%  confidence  interval  for  the  test  to 
reference ratio of geometric least square means was calculated for ln-transformed Cmax and AUC0-t using mixed 
procedure of SAS statistical software version 9.2 from SAS®  Institute Inc, USA. The  ANOVA model included

sequence, period, treatment and subjects nested within sequence as fixed effect and tested at 5% level of the 
significance.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Standard acceptance criteria are proposed for conclusion of bioequivalence. The 90% confidence interval of the 
relative mean Cmax and AUC0-t (of tadalafil) of the test and reference product should be between 80.00% and 
125.00% for ln-transformed data.  
This is acceptable for tadalafil according to the CHMP. A few samples were missing for the later time points and 
they were reported as “M” and any non- reportable concentration was reported as “NR”.  A few deviations in 
blood  collection  times  occurred,  mostly  in  the  later  time  points,  but  the  actual  time  points  of  the  sample 
collection was used in cases of sample collection deviations.

The mean AUC ratio was 93% and 94% after administration of the test and the reference products, respectively. 
The AUC ratio is higher  than 80% in all but two subjects where the ratio is 78% and 79%. The duration of 
sampling is sufficient. The AUC ratio was 78% in subject no. 09 after administration of the test product and 79% 
in subject no. 21 after administration of the reference product in period I.  
No subject had detectable pre-dose plasma levels and no subject reached Cmax at the first sampling time point  
Tmax was not observed in any subject in the first sample time point. One subject observed Tmax at 24.00 hrs 
after administration of the test product. Other subjects observed Tmax in the range of 1.00  – 4.50 hrs after 
administration of the test product which is in line with the range found after administration of the reference 
product.   
The Test to Reference ratio of geometric LSmeans and the corresponding 90% confidence interval for the Cmax 
and AUC0-t were all within the acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Therefore, the Test formulation (Tadalafil 
20 mg film-coated tablets, Mylan Laboratories Limited F-4 & F-12, MIDC, Malegaon, Sinnar Nashik-422 113, 
Maharashtra,  India)  is  judged  to  be  bioequivalent  to  the  Reference  formulation  (CIALIS®  (tadalafil)  20  mg 
film-coated tablets, Eli Lilly Nederland B.V., Grootslag 1-5, NL-3991 RA, Houten, The Netherlands) in healthy, 
adult human male subjects under fasting conditions.  
The samples where the plasma concentration was above upper limit of quantitation were diluted and repeated. 
The dilution integrity was validated and the reported values are acceptable.  
The test to reference ratio of geometric LSmeans and corresponding 90% confidence interval for the Cmax and 
AUC0-t were all within the acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. 
The bioequivalence has been shown appropriately under fasting conditions. 
Section 2.5.2 of the clinical overview Module 2.5 includes information on the two bioequivalence studies under 
fasting  and  fed  conditions.  The  text  after  the  synopsis  in  the  same  section  has  also  been  updated  with 
information on the two bioequivalence studies. 
In vitro dissolution  
In vitro dissolution tests were conducted using USP Type – II apparatus (Paddle), comparing the test and the 
reference products used in the bioequivalence study (the biobatches) as well as the test biobatch with the lower 
strengths of the applied product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707959/2014 
Page 20/26 
 
  
  
 
 
In vitro dissolution tests complementary to the bioequivalence study 
More than 85% of the labelled amount of the drug was released within 15 minutes from the test and the 
reference biobatches in 0.5% SLS in water (release media).  
For the dissolution tests comparing the test and the reference biobatches in 0.5% SLS in 0.1N HCl, 0.5% SLS in 
pH 4.5 Acetate buffer and 0.5% SLS in pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer the calculated similarity factor was 39.30, 48.16 
and 31.85, respectively. The drug release was found to be faster in the test product when compared to the 
reference product and it leads to the lower f2 value (less than 50), this may be attributed by the difference in the 
composition between the test and reference product. Though, the f2 value between the test and reference 
product is found to be below 50, these two products have been proven to be bioequivalent.  
In vitro dissolution tests in support of a biowavier of strengths 
More than 85% of the labelled amount of the drug  was released within 15 minutes from the test biobatch and 
the lowers strengths of the Tadalafil Mylan product in 0.5% SLS in water (release media), 0.5% SLS in 0.1N HCl, 
0.5% SLS in 0.1N HCl, 0.5% SLS in pH 4.5 Acetate buffer and 0.5% SLS in pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer.  
Safety data 
There were no adverse events or serious adverse events reported in the bioequivalence study.  
Vital signs measurements and post-laboratory tests confirmed the absence of significant changes in the 
subjects´ state of health.  
Both the products were safe and well tolerated at selected dose level in the participated subjects.  
Conclusions 
The application contains an adequate review of published clinical data  
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Tadalafil Mylan 20 mg film-coated tablets and Cialis 20 mg 
film-coated tablets under fasting conditions.

To support the application, the applicant has submitted two of bioequivalence studies. Statement of GCP 
compliance and compliance with applicable principles of GLP is provided. A statement is provided to confirm that 
the bioequivalence study carried out outside the European Union meets the ethical requirements of the 
European Union Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The studies were open label, balanced, laboratory-blinded, randomised, single dose, two-treatment, 
two-sequence, two-period, two-way crossover oral bioequivalence study comparing two different formulations 
of tadalafil 20 mg film-coated tablets, Tadalafil Mylan and CIALIS®, in 30 healthy, adult, human male subjects 
under fasting conditions. After an overnight fasting of at least 10 hours the subjects received either the test or 
the reference formulation according to the randomization schedule. The study was conducted under 
standardised conditions. The sampling points, overall sampling time as well as the wash-out period of 16 days 
were adequate. Tadalafil was measured in human plasma using a validated LC/MS/MS method. The 
pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. The test to reference ratio of geometric LS 
means and the corresponding 90% confidence interval for the Cmax and AUC0-t were all within the acceptance 
range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated under fasting conditions. 
Both products were safe and well tolerated at selected dose level in the participated subjects. The in vitro 
dissolution tests complimentary to the bioequivalence study comparing the test and the reference biobatches at 
different pH levels were conducted using solubility enhancer (surfactants) that was added to the dissolution 
media used. Comparative in vitro dissolution tests are generally expected to be conducted in simple aqueous 
buffers without the addition of solubility enhancer (surfactants). 
The results of study TADA-1K-622-13 and study no. TADA-1937-13 with 20 mg formulation can be extrapolated 
to other strengths 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg, according to conditions in the relevant Guidelines.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The application contains an adequate review of published clinical data.  
Bioequivalence has been shown between Tadalafil Mylan 20 mg film-coated tablets and Cialis 20 mg film-coated 
tablets under fasting conditions. Section 2.5.2 of the clinical overview Module 2.5 has been updated to include 
in the introduction text information on the two bioequivalence studies under fasting and fed conditions. The text 
after the synopsis in the same section has also been updated with information on the two bioequivalence 
studies.   
Clinical Study Report for study no. TADA-1K-622-13 in Module 5.3.1.2. was updated during the evaluation 
procedure to include the updated dissolution data without surfactant at the beginning of the document. This 
update was found to be acceptable by the CHMP.

a bridging report making reference to originator product for content and Sildenafil Mylan for design and layout. 
The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of tadalafil film-coated tablets. The reference product Cialis is 
indicated as follows: 
For 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg: 
Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males.

In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. 
CIALIS is not indicated for use by women. 
For 5 mg: 
Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. 
In order for tadalafil to be effective for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation is required. 
Treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adult males. 
CIALIS is not indicated for use by women. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well 
as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects 
based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The results of studies TADA-1K-622-13 and TADA-1937-13 with 20 mg formulation CAN be extrapolated to 
other strengths 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg, according to conditions in Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr*, section 4.1.6. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a study design considered adequate to evaluate the 
bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, 
sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of [applied product] met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared 
with the [reference product]. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, 
AUC0-, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 
125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Tadalafil Mylan in the treatment of approved indication is favourable and therefore

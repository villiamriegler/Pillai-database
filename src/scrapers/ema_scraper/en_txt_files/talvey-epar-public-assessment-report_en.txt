1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Janssen-Cilag International N.V. submitted on 3 January 2023 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Talvey through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
Talvey was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/21/2486 on 20 August 2021 in the 
following condition: treatment of multiple myeloma. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Talvey as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human/EPAR/Talvey 
The applicant applied for the following indication: as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients 
with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including 
an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have 
demonstrated disease progression or did not respond to the last therapy. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0395/2019 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products.

1.5.  Applicant’s requests for consideration 
1.5.1.  Conditional marketing authorisation 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a conditional marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation. 
1.5.2.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
1.5.3.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance talquetamab contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.6.  PRIME 
Talvey was granted eligibility to PRIME on 29 January 2021 in the following indication: treatment of 
adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, who previously received ≥ 3 prior lines of 
therapy. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
•  Despite available treatments, there is still a need for new treatment options for relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma patients whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor, an 
immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 antibody. 
• 
The non-clinical data provided evidence of biological activity and anti-tumour activity in 
multiple myeloma. 
• 
Preliminary clinical data offers encouraging evidence of a treatment effect in a heavily pre-
treated population but is somewhat limited by the short duration of exposure which does not 
allow estimation of duration of response. 
•  Uncertainty of reported effects is offset by novel mechanism of action, which would provide a 
genuine new option in a population with limited treatment options. 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Alexandre Moreau was appointed by the CHMP as rapporteur. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 01 July 2021. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
• 
• 
• 
commercial shelf-life strategy 
further characterisation of GPRC5D expression  
the criteria for establishing similarity between the 800µg/kg q2w and 400µg/kg qw dosing 
regimens

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Talvey is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory 
agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression 
or did not respond to the last therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare and incurable plasma cell neoplasm which typically affects adults 
mostly over 60 years of age. The median age at diagnosis is 65–70 years; MM is very rare in patients 
younger than 40 years old (2% of cases). 
MM accounts for 1%-1.8% of all cancers and is the second most common haematological malignancy 
(after non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL]) with an estimated incidence in Europe of 4.5-6/100 000/year, 
with approximately 176.404 new MM cases and 117,077 deaths due to MM anticipated in 2020 
worldwide (The Global Cancer Observatory 2020).  
MM is characterised by the increased proliferation of malignant monoclonal plasma cells in the bone 
marrow, with the subsequent bone marrow failure due to replacement of normal bone marrow 
haematopoiesis, the over-production of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein, either intact 
immunoglobulins and/or free light chains [FLC]) which could be detected in the serum or urine, and 
finally the presence of systemic symptoms named as CRAB (hyperCalcemia, Renal impairment, 
Anaemia and Bone lesions). Increased susceptibility to infections (immunoparesis) and neurological 
complications are also present (Palumbo 2011). 
Based on karyotype, MM is classified as non-hyperdiploid and hyperdiploid, with the latter accounting 
for 50% to 60% of cases and characterised by trisomies in odd-numbered chromosomes. MM has a 
heterogeneous progression pathway, with multiple relapses over time, whereby several MM cell 
subclones coexist at baseline and compete for dominance over time, leading to the evolution of drug-
resistance clones [Laubach, 2014].  
Drug resistance to prior regimens in patients with relapsed/refractory (RR) MM is due to continuous 
changes in the disease biology, in which a higher proportion of malignant cells are expressing a more 
aggressive, highly proliferative phenotype over time (Anderson, 2008). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Multiple myeloma, a malignant disorder of the plasma cells characterised by uncontrolled and 
progressive proliferation of a plasma cell clone, and accounts for approximately 10% of haematological 
malignancies (Rodriguez-Abreu 2007; Rajkumar 2011). The proliferation of the malignant clonal 
plasma cells leads to subsequent replacement of normal bone marrow haematopoietic precursors and 
overproduction of monoclonal paraproteins (M-proteins). Characteristic hallmarks of multiple myeloma 
include osteolytic lesions, anaemia, increased susceptibility to infections, hypercalcemia, renal 
insufficiency or failure, and neurological complications (Palumbo 2011). Profound intra-tumoral 
heterogeneity is observed throughout the disease course but is especially problematic after multiple 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023  
Page 12/155 
 
 
 
 
lines of treatment. The coexistence of different tumour subclones displaying different drug sensitivities 
contributes to both progression of disease and development of drug resistance (Barlogie 2014). 
The criteria for diagnosis of MM as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), 
requires 10% clonal BM plasma cells or biopsy proven bony or extra-medullary plasmacytoma and 
evidence of end organ damage that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell proliferative 
disorder, or biomarkers of malignancy (60% clonal BM plasma cells or involved/uninvolved serum-free 
light chain ratio >100 or > 1 focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging studies). 
The course of MM is characterised by a period of disease control after initial therapy followed by 
progression, typically with subsequently shorter periods of response and relapse with each successive 
therapy (Moreau, 2017). The treatment of MM has notably progressed with the availability of new 
drugs and its combinations, such way that survival of patients with newly diagnosed MM has increased 
from approximately 3 years in the years 1985 to 1998 (Kyle 2003) to 6 to 10 years (Moreau 2015) 
along the last 15 years. Despite the significant improvement in patients’ survival over the past 20 
years, only 10%-15% of patients achieve or exceed expected survival compared with the matched 
general population. 
The estimated 5-year survival rate for patients with multiple myeloma is approximately 54% 
(Cancer.net 2020). With each successive relapse, symptoms return, quality of life worsens, and the 
chance and duration of response typically decreases. Therefore, there remains a significant and critical 
unmet need for new therapeutic options directed at alternative mechanisms of action that can better 
control the disease; provide deeper, more sustained responses; and yield better long-term outcomes 
including maintenance of HRQoL. 
Despite advance in therapy, MM remains incurable. Although autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) 
has extended survival in newly diagnosed MM, practically all patients eventually relapse, and with each 
successive relapse, the chance of response and duration of response typically decreases and ultimately 
the disease becomes refractory and results in cumulative end organ damage (e.g., renal, cytopenias, 
infections and bone complications). 
2.1.4.  Management 
The treatment landscape for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) has changed in recent 
years. Current treatment of MM includes glucocorticoids, chemotherapy, primarily alkylating agents, 
high dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT, proteasome inhibitors (PIs, such as bortezomib, carfilzomib 
and ixazomib), immunomodulatory agents (such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide), 
monoclonal antibodies ((mAbs), such as daratumumab, isatuximab and elotuzumab) and the histone 
deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. Common standard regimens include either a PI or an IMiD in 
combination with dexamethasone with or without a monoclonal antibody such as daratumumab. The 
triplet combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) is a standard of 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) treatment 
guidelines (NCCN 2020 and Moreau 2017). Newer classes of medications including XPO1 inhibitors 
(selinexor) and antibody drug conjugates targeting BCMA (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) have recently 
been approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA), but have limited therapeutic activity and 
substantial toxicity. 
The choice of therapy in the relapse setting depends on several parameters such as age, performance 
status, comorbidities, the type, efficacy and tolerance of the previous treatment, the number of prior 
treatment lines, the available remaining treatment options, the interval since the last therapy and the 
type of relapse (i.e., clinical versus biochemical relapse; in the case of biochemical relapse, treatment 
can be delayed).

Despite multiple therapeutic options, multiple myeloma remains incurable. All patients eventually 
relapse and become refractory to existing treatments. Median OS in patients who have received at 
least three prior multiple myeloma lines of therapy and are refractory to both an IMiD and a PI is only 
13 months (Kumar 2017). The reported ORR for approved therapies for the population of heavily pre-
treated and refractory patients with multiple myeloma, is approximately 30% (Table 1). 
Table 1. Comparison of Efficacy of Therapies for the Treatment of Heavily Pre-treated Relapsed or 
Refractory Multiple Myeloma 
In a recently published chart review, investigators from 14 academic institutions analysed 275 patients 
to determine the efficacy of subsequent treatments after disease progression on an anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody treatment (Gandhi 2019). This multicentre retrospective, observational study 
investigated the natural history and outcomes of patients with multiple myeloma refractory to CD38 
monoclonal antibodies (MAMMOTH study). Patients were heavily pre-treated with a median of 4 prior 
lines of therapy (range: 1-16). Regardless of the particular salvage regimen chosen, the observed 
efficacy of the next treatment after progression on PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody 
therapy was dismal.  
The median OS for the entire cohort was 8.6 months (95% [CI]: 7.5-9.9), ranging from 5.6 months for 
penta-refractory patients (refractory to anti-CD38 antibody, 2 PIs, and 2 IMiDs) to 11.2 months for 
patients not simultaneously refractory to an IMiD and PI. Among patients who received ≥1 subsequent 
treatment after becoming refractory to anti-CD38 antibody therapy (90% of patients in the study), the 
response rate averaged 31%, with a median PFS and median OS of 3.4 months and 9.3 months, 
respectively. The median OS for patients who received no further treatment was 1.3 months. The 
results of the MAMMOTH study were derived from real-world data and support the lack of options for 
patients who had prior exposure to a PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody therapy. Despite 
new therapeutic achievements with novel mechanisms of action, multiple myeloma remains an

incurable disease in which all patients eventually relapse. There remains an unmet medical need for 
new treatment options beyond the current classes of anti-myeloma therapy. 
B-cell maturation antigen, also known as CD269 and TNFRSF17, is a 20 kilodalton, type III membrane 
protein that is part of the tumour necrosis receptor superfamily. BCMA is predominantly expressed in 
B-lineage cells and plays a critical role in B-cell maturation and subsequent differentiation into plasma 
cells (Tai 2015). B-cell maturation antigen binds 2 ligands that induce B cell proliferation: a 
proliferation-inducing ligand ([APRIL]; CD256) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF; CD257) (Avery 
2003; Darce 2007; Patel 2004). Binding of BCMA monomers to the APRIL trimer triggers activation and 
phosphorylation of p38MAPK, ELK, and NF-κB through intracellular tumor necrosis factor receptor 
associated factor molecules leading to pro-survival gene regulation (Bossen 2006; Hsi 2008; Korde 
2011). Comparative studies have shown a lack of BCMA in most normal tissues and absence of 
expression on CD34-positive haematopoietic stem cells (Carpenter 2013; Kimberley 2009). This 
selective expression and the biological importance for the proliferation and survival of myeloma cells 
makes BCMA a promising target for the treatment of multiple myeloma. 
Belantamab mafodotin-blmf is a humanised IgG1κ monoclonal antibody conjugated with a cytotoxic 
agent, maleimidocaproyl monomethyl auristatin F (mcMMAF) that binds to BCMA on myeloma cell 
surfaces causing cell cycle arrest and inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Belantamab 
mafodotin-blmf was recently approved on the basis of the Phase 2, open-label DREAMM-2 study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of belantamab mafodotin monotherapy in patients with 
RRMM who had 4 or more prior lines of treatment, were refractory to a PI, an IMiD, and had failed 
treatment with an anti-CD38 antibody. The ORR of DREAMM-2 as assessed by IRC was 32% (97.5% 
CI: 20.8, 42.6). The achieved responses were deep, with more than half of responders (60%) 
achieving VGPR or better (Lonial 2020). 
Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy uses modified autologous T cells that are activated in 
a major histocompatibility complex independent manner upon binding to their target resulting in the 
lysis of the targeted cells. Immunotherapy using CAR-T technology to target the BCMA receptor has 
emerged as a highly promising therapy for patients with advanced multiple myeloma who have 
exhausted available therapies such as PI, IMiD, and CD38 monoclonal antibodies. 
Early data for idecabtagene vicleucel, a BCMA-directed CAR-T immunotherapy, indicated that BCMA 
CAR-T therapy could lead to an ORR of approximately 85%, a complete response (CR) rate of 45%, 
and median PFS of 11.8 months (Raje 2019). Of the 128 subjects who were infused with idecabtagene 
vicleucel, the ORR was 73.4% for all doses tested and 82% for subjects treated with 450 x 106 CAR-
positive T cells or higher. The rate of CR/sCR was 31%. The median PFS was 8.6 months. Eighty-four 
percent of the subjects experienced cytokine release syndrome that was generally mild (Munshi 2020). 
Most recently, data for idecabtagene vicleucel showed an ORR of approximately 73%, CR rate of 33%, 
a median PFS of 8.8 months, a median DoR of 10.7 months, and a median OS of 19.4 months (Munshi 
2021). On 18 August 2021, idecabtagene vicleucel received EMA conditional approval for the treatment 
of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior 
therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody 
and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
Finally, on 24 August, teclistamab, a bispecific antibody against BCMA and cluster of differentiation 3 
(CD3) receptors, received EMA conditional approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, including an 
immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated 
disease progression on the last therapy. 
Overall, there is an unmet medical need for more treatment options capable of achieving deep and 
durable responses that afford the opportunity for treatment-free intervals and improved quality of life

(QoL) for patients with RR MM who have received ≥ 3 prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory 
agent, a PI, and an anti-CD38 mAb. 
2.2.  About the product 
Talquetamab is a novel, humanised IgG4 bispecific antibody designed to target the CD3 receptor 
complex on T cells and on GPRC5D-expressing multiple myeloma cells, resulting in T cell activation and 
subsequent lysis of GPRC5D-expressing multiple myeloma cells. As a stable bispecific IgG molecule 
generated through controlled Fab (fragment antigen binding) arm exchange following the method 
reported by Labrijn 2013, talquetamab is able to draw T cells in close proximity to myeloma cells, 
without regard to T cell receptor specificity.  
The applicant targets the following indication: as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an 
immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated 
disease progression or did not respond to the last therapy. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on a novel mechanism of action, 
providing an opportunity to treat MM patients refractory to approved medicinal products. Although 
limited clinical data were available, the ORR and CR rate observed were considered promising. In 
addition, the off-the shelf availability and less burdensome treatment procedure of talquetamab were 
considered important benefits from the clinical perspective.  
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The applicant is conducting a multicentre, randomised, open-label Phase 3 study 
((64407564MMY3002) to determine whether talquetamab in combination with daratumumab and 
pomalidomide (Tal- DP; Arm A) and talquetamab in combination with daratumumab (Tal-D; Arm 
C) have better efficacy respectively than the combination of daratumumab, pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone (DPd; Arm B) in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who 
have previously received at least 1 prior line of therapy. The applicant believes that the results 
from Study 64407564MMY3002 would provide sufficient evidence to confirm the findings of the 
single arm Phase ½ Study 64407564MMY1001, addressing any remaining uncertainties and would 
allow conversion of the conditional MA based on Study 64407564MMY1001 to a standard MA. It is 
anticipated that the interim analysis of Study 64407564MMY3002 will be completed by April 2027.   
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as talquetamab will provide a novel, targeted option for 
the treatment of subjects with multiple myeloma, with a mechanism of action that is unique to all 
other approved therapies. Patients who progress after having received therapies from the 3 main 
therapeutic classes (IMIDs, PIs, and anti CD38 monoclonal antibodies) have limited options that 
may be unsuitable in a heavily treated population. It is therefore of importance to identify 
alternative targets for T cell redirection for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma. Targeting the GPRC5D receptor, highly specific to malignant plasma cells, represents a 
novel mechanism of action and a new option for heavily pretreated patients. Because of the high 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023

expression of GPRC5D in malignant plasma cells and low expression in normal human tissue, 
GPRC5D is a promising new target for immunotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. Talquetamab offers a promising new therapeutic option for 
triple-class exposed patients that will be readily available to all patients and has a favourable 
safety profile and superior efficacy compared with other off-the-shelf alternatives. Talquetamab 
also provides an option for patients who are unable to wait for manufacturing of CAR-T cells, are 
unfit for this modality of therapy, and/or in addition, have progressed after a BCMA therapy and 
are in need of alternative treatments. As such, the applicant considers that talquetamab fulfils an 
unmet medical need and will provide a major contribution to public health, specifically for multiple 
myeloma patients. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Talquetamab, the active substance in Talvey, is a humanised immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-proline, 
alanine, alanine (IgG4-PAA) bispecific monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against G protein-coupled 
receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D) and the CD3 receptors. It is produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. The finished product is presented as a 
solution for subcutaneous injection in 1.5 mL and 1 mL vials containing respectively 3 mg (2 mg/mL) 
and 40 mg (40 mg/mL) of talquetamab. The syringes and transfer needles used for administration are 
provided separately. 
Talquetamab is formulated with EDTA disodium salt dehydrate, glacial acetic acid, polysorbate 20, 
sodium acetate trihydrate, sucrose, and water for injections. 
2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Talquetamab is a humanised IgG4 bispecific antibody against GPRC5D and CD3 receptors. 
Talquetamab consists of 2 heavy chains (HC) and 2 light chains (LC), joined by disulfide bonds.  
Talquetamab is prepared by controlled reduction and oxidation of JNJ-64386972 Protein A (anti-
GPRC5D MAb) and JNJ-63483043 Protein A (anti-CD3 MAb) resulting in an exchange of the Fab arms. 
The Fab arm exchange was facilitated by amino acid substitution in the CH3 domain of the parental 
JNJ-63483043 HC, enhancing the stability of the heterodimer. Talquetamab has a molecular mass of 
147,201 Da for the predominant glycoform.  
1The bispecific design of the antibody allows for simultaneous engagement of T cells (CD3 binding) 
and malignant B cells (GPRC5D binding). The process of bringing the malignant B cells into close 
proximity of the T cells leads to killing of the cancer cells. The mechanism of action is thus based on 
functionality of both the CD3-binding and GPRC5D-binding domains.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
The active substance is manufactured at Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI), Barnahely, Ringaskiddy, 
Co. Cork, Ireland. After thawing and pooling of the 2 parental antibodies, the individual parental 
antibody pools are combined and undergo reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds in the parental 
antibodies by a reducing agent to allow for bispecific antibody formation. Talquetamab is then purified 
by a series of chromatography steps, viral inactivation, viral filtration and ultrafiltration/diafiltration 
steps.  
The description of manufacturing process and controls is appropriately detailed. Each production 
bioreactor of parental antibody derives from a single working cell bank (WCB) vial.  
Reprocessing is not routinely performed as part of the active substance manufacturing process but 
some reprocessing steps have been prospectively identified and validated at small-scale. If 
reprocessing occurs, a verification protocol will be applied and a variation submitted as appropriate. 
All sites involved in manufacture, control and storage of the active substance operate in accordance 
with EU GMP. 
Control of materials 
A list of raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including contact filters and chromatography 
resins, is provided. Raw materials are tested according to European pharmacopoeia where available. 
Non-compendial materials are tested and released according to active substance manufacturer’s in-
house specifications. Composition of the powder media used for the cell culture process are chemically 
defined and animal-component free.  
Information on the source of the host cell line, the preparation and description of the expression 
vectors, and the establishment of the cell banks is provided. The cell lines for anti-GPRC5D MAb and 
anti-CD3 MAb parental antibodies were transfected independently.  These cell lines were used to 
produce the finished product for all clinical trials and will be used to produce commercial product. Both 
master cell bank (MCB) and WCB were tested and characterised in accordance with ICH guidelines and 
were both confirmed to be of CHO origin. Expression of the expected cDNA sequences was confirmed. 
Genetic stability of the production cell line has been demonstrated for anti-GPRC5D MAb and for anti-
CD3 MAb. Preparation and testing of future WCBs is described.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Relevant process parameters and in-process controls (IPCs) were laid down in the process description 
with target and proven acceptable ranges (PARs). The proposed IPCs are overall acceptable. 
Process validation 
Process validation was executed on commercial-scale batches for the anti-GPRC5D MAb intermediate, 
commercial-scale batches for the anti-CD3 MAb intermediate, and commercial-scale batches for the 
active substance. For each process stage, a brief summary, results, and conclusions were provided.  
Evaluation of quality attributes through release and characterisation testing, IPCs, and process 
performance attributes demonstrated that the manufacturing process is robust and reproducible where 
process parameters operate within their operating range. 
Levels of residual impurities have been demonstrated to be reduced to acceptably low levels in the 
active substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023

Evaluation of process intermediates hold times was appropriately addressed using material taken from 
commercial-scale batches. Demonstration of stability included both biochemical and microbial aspects. 
Chromatography resin lifetimes and shipping validation were adequately addressed. Overall, the active 
substance manufacturing process is considered validated. 
Manufacturing process development 
The strategy taken to develop the talquetamab active substance manufacturing process comprises the 
definition of critical quality attributes (CQAs), process development, risk assessment (Failure Mode 
Effects Analysis - FMEA), scale down model establishment, and process characterisation studies. This 
approach follows the principles described in ICH guidance (ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, and Q11). Overall the 
proposed control strategy has been thoroughly justified and is suitable to control the process and 
deliver a product with consistent quality, as confirmed by process validation. In responses to 
questions, few inconsistencies were satisfactorily addressed and some points were clarified. 
Comparability studies were performed to evaluate the manufacturing changes made to the active 
substance and finished product during clinical development. The major process changes associated 
with each study were appropriately summarised and included notably changes in active substance and 
finished product concentrations, as well as an increase in active substance purification scale. The 
batches used in the last comparability studies were all used in Phase 1/2 pivotal study 
‘64407564MMY1001’. The batches derived from commercial process can thus be considered as 
representative of clinical material.  
Impact of the process changes on the quality attributes was assessed using combination of in-process, 
release, characterisation, ICH stability, and degradation rate data. Overall, the analytical assessments 
demonstrated that the pre-change and post-change materials were comparable and provided 
confidence that all of the manufacturing changes introduced during clinical development would not 
adversely impact the safety and efficacy of bispecific antibody.  
Characterisation  
Elucidation of structure 
Characterisation of talquetamab includes primary structure, carbohydrate structure, disulfide structure 
and free thiols, intact mass and mass heterogeneity, charge heterogeneity, size heterogeneity, higher 
order structure, biological characterisation (Fab and Fc functions) and structure/function relationships. 
Overall, the characterisation exercise is well established, both with regard to the type and number of 
orthogonal techniques employed and with regard to the experimental designs to evaluate the main 
degradative pathways. The ability of the various methods to identify the most important post-
translational modifications (PTMs) classified as CQAs was also evaluated.  
The studies concerning biological characterisation and structure/function relationships are considered 
largely satisfactory. The mechanism of action of talquetamab has been studied and characterised in 
detail using a comprehensive set of bioassays, necessary for such a complex antibody with multiple 
functions. Further characterisation data were provided to support the binding specificity to GPRC5D 
and the suitability of T cell activation assay. This data was considered adequate. 
Impurities 
Data provided by the applicant to support characterisation of impurities in the active substance is 
considered appropriate.

2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications 
The active substance specifications include control of identity, purity and impurities, potency and other 
general tests. 
During the assessment, the acceptance criteria for some purity attributes were tightened and the new 
limits proposed for the specifications are overall considered acceptable. 
The control of a complete list of the different impurities is included in the specification, together with 
the methods employed (at release or as IPC) for adequate monitoring.  
The applicant agreed to strengthen the identity testing strategy to the active substance release 
specification. The additional identity testing will allow to confirm the identity of both anti-GPRC5D and 
anti-CD3 arms of talquetamab. 
Analytical procedures 
The proposed procedures were satisfactorily validated and they were considered suitable to control the 
active substance on a routine basis. Minor concerns were raised which were satisfactorily addressed. 
Batch analysis  
Batch analysis results are provided for batches representative of the final commercial process and 
batches derived from previous active substance concentration. Results confirm consistency and 
uniformity of the batches, indicating that the process is under control. 
Reference standard 
The applicant established appropriately characterised in-house primary and working reference 
materials, prepared from lots representative of production. Working reference material used in the 
testing of production lots was calibrated against the primary reference material. Documentation of the 
qualification, storage conditions and stability programme of primary and working reference materials 
was provided. Protocol for qualification of future primary and working reference materials was also 
described. 
The same reference materials are used for active substance and finished product. 
Container closure 
The intermediates and talquetamab active substance are stored and shipped into polycarbonate 
bottles. The choice of the container closure system was chosen to pose low risk for extractables and 
leachables and to provide adequate protection from microbial contamination. Compatibility of the 
container with the active substance is demonstrated through stability studies. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Parental antibody intermediates 
Batches of anti-GPRC5D MAb and anti-CD3 MAb were manufactured and placed in the stability 
monitoring programs. The long-term, real time, real conditions stability data show no significant trend 
over the claimed shelf-lives. The accumulated data for clinical, process validation and post process 
validation batches support the proposed shelf life for the anti-GPRC5D MAb and the anti-CD3 MAb 
when stored at the recommended conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023  
Page 20/155 
 
 
 
 
Active substance 
The shelf-life for the active substance is based on stability studies that were carried out in accordance 
with current ICH/CPMP guidelines. 
Primary stability studies were performed on clinical batches derived from the pre-change process and 
batches (clinical and process validation) derived from the commercial process. As comparability has 
been demonstrated between the pre-change active substance process and the commercial active 
substance process, this approach is agreed.  
All batches were stored in representative containers (polycarbonate vials). The long-term, real time, 
real-condition stability studies showed no significant change over the proposed shelf life.  
Accelerated and stressed stability studies were also conducted to assess the effect of these conditions 
on product quality. As for long-term studies, the results did not show any significant trend under 
accelerated and stressed storage conditions.  
In addition, freeze-thaw cycling studies were performed, and the results support that the active 
substance met all acceptance criteria. The data collected to date demonstrate that the active substance 
remains in conformance with the proposed commercial stability acceptance criteria for all the attributes 
that were tested.  
Based on stability data provided, the proposed shelf-life, when stored at the recommended 
temperature, can be granted for the active substance. 
Post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment are also considered overall adequate. The 
choice to not include pH in active substance stability specification is considered acceptable, taking into 
account that the pH test is maintained at finished product level. 
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description of the product 
The finished product (strengths of 2 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL) is supplied as a sterile liquid in a vial for 
subcutaneous administration. The finished product contains no preservative and is for single use only. 
Each 2 mg/mL finished product vial contains 3 mg of talquetamab in a 1.5 mL nominal fill volume. The 
primary packaging consists of a 6R Type 1 glass vial with an elastomeric closure and an aluminium seal 
with a flip-off cap.  
Each 40 mg/mL finished product vial contains 40 mg of talquetamab in a 1.0 mL nominal fill volume. 
The primary packaging consists of 2 mL Type I glass vial with an elastomeric closure and an aluminium 
seal with a flip-off cap.  
The final commercial finished product contains 2 mg/mL or 40 mg/mL talquetamab, EDTA disodium 
salt dehydrate, glacial acetic acid, polysorbate 20, sodium acetate trihydrate, sucrose, and water for 
injections. The pH is 5.2, stored at 2-8⁰C.   
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product formulation evolved from a frozen formulation to a liquid formulation. To facilitate 
late phase clinical studies, two new presentations, 2 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL liquid finished product, 
were developed to achieve the prescribed dose in a practical volume for subcutaneous administration.  
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023  
Page 21/155 
 
 
 
 
There is no overage in the finished product. To ensure the nominal volume can be withdrawn and 
administered, an overfill is included in the vial.  
An enhanced approach was used to develop the commercial manufacturing process and establish an 
appropriate control strategy for talquetamab finished product. This approach includes definition of the 
quality target product profile (QTPP), identification of the CQAs and CPPs through prior knowledge, risk 
assessments and characterisation studies. Data provided to justify the finished product control strategy 
are comprehensive.  
A combination of lab-scale and at-scale process studies evaluating thawing and storage of thawed 
active substance, mixing, pumping, filtration, and filling were performed. Furthermore, hold time 
studies were performed to evaluate in-process hold steps and cumulative exposure to ambient light. 
Regarding sterile filtration, studies were performed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane and 
quantity of flush was determined which is supported by process validation runs and deemed 
acceptable. 
Compatibility of the container closure system with the dosage form was assessed with respect to 
physicochemical testing (i.e. extractables and leachables), stability testing, and container closure 
integrity testing. 
Talquetamab finished product contains no preservative. The microbiological quality complies with EU 
requirements for sterile products and is ensured by a combination of various measures - sterile 
product-contact components, sterile in-line filtration, environmental and media monitoring - and is 
confirmed by microbiological IPC testing as well as sterility release testing.  
The finished product is intended to be administered subcutaneously with a separately-obtained syringe. 
Physicochemical stability of the finished product was demonstrated for the durations and conditions as 
listed in the product information. From a microbiological point of view, although microbial challenge 
tests demonstrated that microbial proliferation was not observed in the vial of talquetamab finished 
product, the product should be used immediately. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
Janssen Biologics B.V. (Netherlands) is responsible for EU batch certification. All sites involved in 
manufacture, control and storage of the finished product operate in accordance with EU GMP. 
A minimum and a maximum batch size is defined for both finished product strengths. The finished 
product manufacturing process is standard and starts with thawing of the active substance. The 
finished product solution is then compounded into a dilution buffer pre-filtrated and sterilised by 
filtration immediately prior to filling. The vials are stoppered, crimped and a 100% visual inspection is 
performed before shipping. The level of detail in the description of the manufacturing process has been 
updated in order to provide a more clear and comprehensive overview of the finished product 
manufacturing process and relative controls. In process controls are found overall adequate. 
Process parameter ranges are supported by manufacturing process development. The established hold 
times are specified and validated. No reprocessing is claimed.  
Process validation 
Validation of the finished product manufacturing process is based on analysis of a number of 
consecutive process performance qualification (PPQ) batches. The adopted validation strategy has been 
further justified in terms of bracketing approach, number of runs needed to validate different strengths 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023  
Page 22/155 
 
 
 
 
and different batch sizes. The validation studies included control of all process parameters (CPPs and 
non-CPPs) and IPCs, as well as CQAs. The results met acceptance criteria, demonstrating the finished 
product manufacturing process is consistent throughout the different steps (thawing, filtration and 
filling).  
The finished product manufacturing process, media-fill, filters, depyrogenation of the materials and the 
handling of the product during shipping are validated (or qualified). The acceptance criteria are met. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications and analytical procedures 
The finished product specifications include control of identity, purity and impurities, potency and other 
general tests. 
A combination of methods were confirmed to be sufficient for confirming the identity of talquetamab. 
Some tests that were included in the active substance are not included in the finished products 
specifications due to no significant changes in the levels of these attributes during finished product 
manufacturing and storage. 
Acceptance criteria setting is based on a combination of several factors: clinical experience, stability 
and process effects, product-specific knowledge, prior knowledge, current compendia or regulatory 
guidelines, and formulation development studies. Overall, the proposed specifications are considered 
justified and sufficient to deliver product with consistent quality. Some limits initially proposed were 
tightened.  
The methods for finished product were validated as per ICH Q2 R1 requirements. 
Overall, the finished product specifications are considered acceptable. 
Characterisation of impurities 
The potential presence of nitrosamine impurities has been evaluated by taking into account the 
manufacturing process. As Talvey is a biological medicinal product with no chemically synthesised 
components, no meaningful exposure to the nitrosating agents is expected. 
Based on a risk assessment of the manufacturing process, the risk is considered low since the 
structure, materials used in manufacture, manufacturing conditions, process, purification, and storage 
conditions are not conducive to nitrosation reactions.  
A component-based risk assessment for the potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished 
product was conducted in accordance with the ICH Q3D(R1) Guideline for Elemental Impurities, taking 
into account potential contributions from the active substance, excipients, manufacturing equipment, 
container closure system (primary packaging), and processing water. 
Batch analysis 
Analytical results of finished product batches derived from process validation and clinical trials are 
provided. All batches from process validation were manufactured at the commercial site using the 
intended commercial process. All results comply with the defined acceptance criteria. Batch analysis 
has been updated to include also analytical results relative to clinical batches derived from previous 
process versions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023  
Page 23/155 
 
 
 
 
 
Container closure 
The primary packaging consists of a Type 1 glass vial with an elastomeric closure and an aluminum 
seal with a flip-off cap. The choice of the container closure system is in line with pharmaceutical 
standards and the components comply with pharmacopeia requirements. 
2.4.3.1.  Stability of the product 
The claimed shelf life of the finished product is 15 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C protected from light. 
Clinical batches and process validation batches of finished product were manufactured and placed in 
the stability monitoring programs. The claimed shelf life is based on 15 months real-time stability data 
for finished product batches (40 mg/mL batches and 2 mg/mL batches). The stability data available to 
date for all clinical and process validation batches of finished product conformed to the proposed 
commercial stability acceptance criteria.  
Supporting stability data obtained from accelerated and stressed storage conditions were also 
presented. A photostability study was conducted and the results from the study demonstrate that the 
surrogate package representative of the commercial secondary package will provide the finished 
product with adequate protection from the effects of the light conditions specified in ICH Q1B. 
In addition, temperature cycling studies were performed and the results support the stability of 
finished product during potential temperature excursions that may be encountered during 
transportation, storage, and handling. The data collected to date demonstrate that the finished product 
will remain in conformance with the proposed commercial stability acceptance criteria that have been 
established for the 5 ± 3°C storage condition for all the analytical procedures used. 
Following CHMP request, the applicant agreed to include pH and turbidity in the finished product 
stability specifications. The stability monitoring programme was updated accordingly. 
Overall, the acceptable shelf life for the finished product is 15 months when stored protected from light 
in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C. 
Chemical and physical in-use stability (prepared syringe) has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C 
to 8°C followed by up to 24 hours at temperature of 15°C to 30°C. 
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally 
not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless preparation has taken place in controlled and 
validated aseptic conditions.  
The prepared syringe should be stored protected from light. 
2.4.3.2.  Adventitious agents 
The use of animal- or human-derived material was restricted to cell line generation and is 
appropriately described, with certificates provided. No materials of direct or indirect animal or human 
origin are used in the talquetamab active substance and finished product manufacturing. The TSE risk 
can be considered as negligible.  
The panel of microbiological, adventitious and endogenous virus tests performed on the MCB, WCB and 
EEPCB (extended end of production cell banks) for each parental monoclonal antibody is defined 
appropriately considering the species of the raw materials of biological origin, and the results are

compliant. The in-process tests performed in routine on the unprocessed bulk prior to harvest are 
appropriate given the CHO origin of the cell lines. 
Viral safety was assessed throughout the process. Reduced-scale models of the chromatography steps 
and the dedicated viral inactivation and removal steps were used to evaluate viral clearance. 
Viral clearance is achieved through orthogonal chromatographic steps, viral inactivation, and physical 
removal of virus. The virus clearance steps were evaluated in the active substance process.  
The studies are mostly well designed, and the results are satisfactory. In summary, the adventitious 
agents safety evaluation is considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Module 3 dossier of Talvey is of very good quality. Information on development, manufacture and 
control of the active substance and finished product have been presented in a satisfactory manner. No 
major concern has been identified. A variety of concerns (Other Concerns) covering the different 
sections of the dossier were originally raised and have been resolved.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Talvey is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
Talvey is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended some points for investigation. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical testing strategy was developed to be consistent with the clinical indication (multiple 
myeloma), administration routes (SC and IV), and dosing regimen of talquetamab (also referred in this 
section as JNJ-64407564). Studies were designed and conducted in accordance with the ICH guidelines 
S6(R1), and S9, as well as S7A, M3(R2), S3A, and S5(R3).

Talquetamab Binding to Multiple Myeloma Cell Lines 
Talquetamab binding to GPRC5D-positive human multiple myeloma cell lines (MM.1R, OPM-2, H929, 
and JIM-3) and GPRC5D-negative human cell lines (Daudi and NALM-6) was determined using flow 
cytometry methods (Figure 2). GPRC5D×null control antibody (containing 1 anti-GPRC5D arm) and 
null×CD3 were used as positive and negative controls respectively in these experiments.

Talquetamab binding profile in whole blood 
To evaluate the binding of talquetamab on leukocytes, whole blood from healthy human donors and 
frozen bone marrow mononuclear cells from multiple myeloma subjects were stained with talquetamab 
and evaluated by FACS using the respective cell markers. Results indicated binding of talquetamab for 
CD4+, CD8+ and NK T cells ( 
Figure 3) but not for any other peripheral blood cell population evaluated (data not shown).

GPRC5D expression on normal human tissues 
Analysis of GPRC5D human normal tissue expression included a review of published literature and 
public domain data.  
Published literature (Inoue 2004; Venkateshaiah 2013; Kodama 2019; Smith 2019; Verkleij 2021) and 
internally generated data (study reports 02212020, 04092020, 07242020, 10162020 and 06292022) 
show that GPRC5D expression is limited to normal plasma cells and specific epithelial cell types in 
keratinised tissues such as skin and tongue. GPRC5D is detected in plasma cells (Venkateshaiah 2013; 
Kodama 2019; Verkleij 2021), and anatomical sites with high numbers of resident normal plasma cells 
(i.e., tonsil, lymph node, spleen) would be expected to contain GPRC5D mRNA. Consistent with 
published data (Smith 2019), expression of GPRC5D in interstitial/tissue-resident plasma cells was 
confirmed internally in tonsil, lymph node, spleen, bone marrow, salivary glands and gastrointestinal 
tract (stomach, duodenum and colon) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridisation (ISH) 
(study reports 10162020 and 06292022; Goldsmith 2021). GPRC5D mRNA and protein expression was 
also confirmed in hair follicles (hair bulb and shaft) and epithelial cells of eccrine sweat glands of the 
skin (Goldsmith 2021; study report 06292022). GPRC5D expression was also detected in keratinised 
structures (filiform papillae) of the human tongue (study report 10162020; Goldsmith 2021) and 
nailbeds of mice (RNA by ISH; Inoue 2004). Similarly, Smith (2019) reported GPRC5D protein 
expression in intestinal immune cells, hair follicles, and sweat glands in skin. 
Internal efforts did not detect GPRC5D by either IHC or ISH on samples of human normal lung, 
including airways, alveoli, pleura, and lymphoid tissues (study report 07242020; Goldsmith 2021). This 
is in apparent conflict with low positive RNA signal for GPRC5D in lung by bulk RNA-sequencing (low 
levels; Genotype-Tissue Expression project; Human Protein Atlas; study DD17024). However, IHC and 
ISH expression data provided higher resolution over the bulk quantitative RNA expression 
measurements (derived from tissue homogenates) because FFPE tissue samples could be pre-screened 
to confirm anatomical location, tissue quality (eg, proper sampling and handling, appropriate 
structures present in the sample, and sample suitability for specific IHC/ISH application), and disease-
free state. Additionally, the IHC and ISH methods allowed for the examination of specific cell types and 
subcellular location. No GPRC5D protein was detected by IHC in cerebellum, brainstem (medulla), 
ependyma or choroid plexus. Low levels of GPRC5D RNA were detected by ISH in the motor neurons of 
the inferior olivary nucleus in the brainstem (medulla; study report 07242020; Goldsmith 2021). These 
motor neurons extend axons into the cerebellum, and detection of RNA in these cells could explain 
very low levels of RNA detection by RT-qPCR in the cerebellum (Pillarisetti 2020). Consistent with this, 
Smith (2019) reported no GPRC5D protein expression in lung or brain. No GPRC5D RNA or protein 
expression was detected in other brain regions and nervous system tissues examined as tissue 
microarray including cerebrum, meninges, corpus callosum, midbrain, thalamus, striatum, spinal cord, 
dorsal root ganglion, or peripheral nerve. 
Effect of JNJ-64407564 on T-cell-dependent cytotoxicity  
Treatment with talquetamab led to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, as measured by % dead cells of 
fluorophore labelled GPRC5D-positive multiple myeloma cell lines (H929, MM.1R, and OPM-2) after 48-
hour incubation at an E:T ratio of 5:1 (determined from fresh and frozen bone marrow samples from 
subjects with multiple myeloma) with T cells from 6 different healthy donors (Figure 4).

GPRC5D-negative cell lines. Data from six T-cell donors was pooled in each graph. Mean ± standard error oKRaf the 
mean is graphed. 
Additionally, the effect of talquetamab on cytotoxicity was tested in an in vitro assay, in which whole 
blood from healthy donors was incubated in the presence of GPRC5D-positive MM H929 cells at an E:T 
ratio of 5:1 (determined from fresh and frozen bone marrow samples from subjects with multiple 
myeloma), along with increasing concentrations of talquetamab for 48 hours. Treatment with 
talquetamab resulted in dose-dependent H929 cytotoxicity. Individual cytotoxicity EC50 (EC20) values 
from the 6 donors ranged from 0.206 to 0.612 (0.041 to 0.357) nM, producing a mean of 0.389 
(0.131) nM (Study report DD17025).  
Effect of talquetamab on T-cell Activation and cytokines release  
The expression of CD25 was measured as an indicator of the degree of T cell activation in the 
cytotoxicity assays by talquetamab (Figure 5).

Note: Talquetamab and negative control molecules were incubated at increasing concentrations with MM cell lines 
and healthy donor pan T cells at an E:T ratio of 5:1 (determined from fresh and frozen bone marrow samples from 
subjects with multiple myeloma) in the presence of fragment crystallizable blocker. After 48 hours of incubation the 
T cell activation was measured as percent CD25 expressing CD3-positive cells. The data above represent the 
average of 6 different T cell donors. 
Talquetamab did not cause activation of T cells in the absence of target GPRC5D-expressing cells, 
demonstrating the specificity of T cell activation (Study report DD17026).  
Cytokine concentrations were determined from H929 assay and respective values were calculated for 
each donor. JNJ-64407564 treatment led to the secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-
10, and IL-13 in the H929 assay (data not shown), consistent with the T-cell activation CD25 
expression data. In general, EC50 values for each cytokine were similar across donors, though the 
maximal values were variable. JNJ-64407564 showed consistent cytokine release upon T-cell 
activation, with IL-8 being the most responsive cytokine.  Mean EC50 (EC20) values were: IFN-γ, 
1.120 (0.615) nM; IL-1β, 0.720 (0.462) nM; TNF-α, 1.545 (0.805) nM; IL-2, 1.962 (1.380) nM; IL-4, 
1.867 (1.733) nM; IL-6, 0.684 (0.441) nM; IL-8, 0.440 (0.273) nM; and IL-10, 1.082 (0.670) nM 
The activation of T cells and the release of cytokines were also determined in a whole blood/H929 
model system. Activation was measured as the percentage of T cells (CD3+) that were also positive for 
activation marker CD25. Treatment with talquetamab resulted in dose-dependent T cell activation as

high as ~50% as. Individual T cell activation EC50 (EC20) from the 6 donors ranged from 0.124 to 
0.407 (0.042 to 0.153) nM, producing a mean of 0.236 (0.083) nM.  
Cytokine concentrations for IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were determined from this 
normal whole blood spiked-in with H929 cell assay and respective values were calculated for each 
donor. JNJ-64407564 produced consistent cytokine release upon T-cell activation, with IL-10 being the 
most responsive cytokine with an EC50 value of 0.107 nM. Mean EC50 (EC20) values were: IFN-γ, 
0.639 (0.245) nM; IL-1β, 0.285 (0.160) nM; TNF-α, 0.598 (0.228) nM; IL-2, 0.554 (0.272) nM; IL-4, 
0.627 (0.277) nM; IL-6, 0.454 (0.099) nM; IL-8, 0.500 (0.105) nM; and IL-10, 0.107 (0.032) nM 
(Study report DD17025).  
Talquetamab binding, cytotoxicity, and T cell activation assays using subject-derived 
CD138-positive multiple myeloma bone marrow cells (DD17025) 
The ability of talquetamab to induce cytotoxicity using primary multiple myeloma samples (n=6) in co-
culture with T cells from healthy donors was assessed by measurement of loss of CD138+ plasma cells. 
Antibody binding and T cell activation potential were also measured (Table 2).

Talquetamab cytotoxicity assays using autologous CD138-expressing multiple myeloma 
patient bone marrow cells (Verkleij 2021) 
Multiple myeloma cell lysis by talquetamab was analysed in an autologous setting with bone marrow 
samples from newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma plus daratumumab-refractory multiple myeloma (Verkleij 
2021). Lysis of CD138high/CD38+ multiple myeloma cells was assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 6).

In vivo pharmacodynamics (study DD17029, 2015-2016) 
Efficacy of JNJ-64407564 measured by effect on tumour volume was evaluated in three GPRC5D+ 
human multiple myeloma (MM) models in non-obese diabetic (NOD) severe combined 
immunodeficiency (SCID) gamma (NSG) mice engrafted with human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) or human T cells. Treatment was either in a prophylactic model where treatment was 
initiated at the time of tumour cell implantation (H929, Figure 7), or in established models where 
treatment was initiated after palpable tumours were formed (MM.1S,  
Figure 8 and RPMI-8226,Figure 9).

Identification of a pharmacologically relevant species/Rationale for use of a tool molecule 
Sequence homology, GPRC5D tissue expression, and molecule binding affinity and functional activity in 
vitro were evaluated to identify a suitable animal species for the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and 
general toxicology evaluation of talquetamab. 
Cynomolgus monkey CD3ε has 88% homology in the ECD relative to the human sequence (study 
report DS-TEC-51663), and talquetamab has similar binding (within approximately 5-fold differential) 
to human and cynomolgus monkey CD3 when measured on human or cynomolgus monkey T cells (Kd 
values: human CD3=15.1 nM and cynomolgus monkey CD3=2.8 nM; study report DS-TEC-91511). 
The tool molecule (JNJ-64024701) was also confirmed to bind to cynomolgus monkey T cells (Kd 
value: 5.88 nM; study report DS-TEC-91511), which is comparable to the binding of talquetamab to 
human T cells. 
The CD3 epsilon chain (CD3ε) recognised by the CD3 fragment antigen binding arm (derived from 
parental antibody CD3B219) in talquetamab and in the tool molecule is poorly conserved in other 
common laboratory species, such as the pig, mouse, guinea pig, and rat with 65%, 63%, 59%, and 
57% homology, respectively, relative to the human sequence (study reports DS-TEC-51663 and DS-
TEC-51660). Because of the poor homology, neither talquetamab nor the tool molecule would be 
expected to have any cross-reactivity with these species. Lack of binding to mouse CD3 was 
demonstrated experimentally with the parental CD3 antibody (CD3B219), and therefore talquetamab 
was not tested for binding to mouse CD3 (study report DS-TEC-102635). 
Full-length hGPRC5D is 94%, 81%, and 96% identical to marmoset, mouse, and cynomolgus/rhesus 
monkey GPRC5D, respectively, based on amino acid sequence alignments (study report DS-TEC-
91511). GPRC5D has 4 extracellular domains; cGPRC5D extracellular loops domains are 88%, 100%, 
87%, and 100% identical to those of human. It is not clear whether talquetamab binds to a single 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023  
Page 34/155 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extracellular loop or more than 1 discontinuous loop. GPRC5D expression in cynomolgus monkey 
exhibits a similar pattern in normal tissues as hGPRC5D; it is primarily expressed in normal plasma 
cells and keratinised structures such as hair follicles in skin (Smith 2019). The high homology and 
similar expression pattern make cynomolgus monkey a relevant species for GPRC5D. 
Talquetamab binds to hGPRC5D but it binds poorly to cGPRC5D and does not bind to marmoset 
GPRC5D. Additionally, talquetamab demonstrated approximately 100-fold lower in vitro bioactivity (T 
cell activation and cytotoxicity) against cGPRC5D-expressing cells compared with hGPRC5D-expressing 
cells. In concordance with the in vitro data, talquetamab showed no adverse effects and minimal 
pharmacodynamic activity in cynomolgus monkeys administered 4 weekly IV doses up to 30 mg/kg 
confirming poor bioactivity in cynomolgus monkey. Therefore, the cynomolgus monkey is not a 
relevant species for toxicity assessment of talquetamab, and a tool molecule strategy was pursued for 
hazard identification. 
The tool molecule (GCDB32 GPRC5DxCD3) identified has binding affinity and in vitro functional activity 
against cGPRC5D-expressing cells consistent with the binding affinity and in vitro functional activity of 
talquetamab against hGPRC5D ( 
Table 3 and Table 4). Based on these data, it was considered an appropriate GPRC5DxCD3 tool 
molecule for hazard identification in cynomolgus monkeys.

The GPRC5D binding arm of talquetamab showed high specificity for GPRC5D, its primary target, on 
both fixed and live cell microarrays, following a screen for binding against fixed HEK293 cells 
expressing 5861 individual full-length human plasma membrane proteins and cell surface-tethered 
human secreted proteins, as well as a further 371 human heterodimers.  
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were not submitted, in accordance with the provisions of the 
ICH S6(R1) and S7A guidance documents. However, cardiovascular, respiratory, and observational 
CNS safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated into the 1-month GLP repeat dose toxicity 
study conducted with the tool molecule in cynomolgus monkeys (See section 2.5.4.2). There were no 
treatment-related effects on the examined cardiovascular (electrocardiograms, blood pressure, heart 
rate), respiratory (respiration rate), or CNS (clinical observations and body temperature) parameters. 
Gross and microscopic pathology assessments indicated that there were no treatment‑related effects 
on heart weight or histo-morphological effects on the heart or skeletal muscles. 
Although the tool molecule had no effects on the cardiovascular system in this study, hypotension and 
tachycardia have been observed in cynomolgus monkeys following treatment with other CD3 
redirectors, which are possibly related to cytokine release (Saber 2017). However, there were no 
significant increases in circulating cytokines in cynomolgus monkeys administered talquetamab or the 
tool molecule.

Absorption 
Talquetamab: Single-dose PK and immunogenicity in cynomolgus monkeys (CP2017PK-002) 
The pharmacokinetic profile of talquetamab was evaluated in male cynomolgus monkeys (4/group) 
after a single IV dose of 0.5 or 5 mg/kg in a recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) formulation or 
0.5 mg/kg in a buffer formulation (Table 5).

Estimated parameters are means of values for 4 males/group.  
a Talquetamab was quantifiable in serum up to 1176 hours and BQL (<0.16 µg/mL) at the 1344 and 1416 hours. 
b Talquetamab was quantifiable in serum up to 408 hours and BQL at 576 hours through the last sampling time 
point of 1416 hours.  
c For 2 of the 4 animals, the AUCinf was slightly larger than 20% (29% and 37%) than AUClast.

d Talquetamab was quantifiable in serum up to the last sampling time point of 1416 hours. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected in 2/4 animals receiving a dose of 0.5 in both rHSA and 
buffer formulations and in all 4 animals receiving the higher 5 mg/kg dose. ADA development likely 
impacted the pharmacokinetics in animals from the 5 mg/kg in rHSA formulation group; however, it 
was unusual that all animals in this group demonstrated a sharp serum concentration decrease at the 
same time point, while the pharmacokinetics in ADA-positive animals from the lower dose group (0.5 
mg/kg in rHSA formulation) seemed unaffected.  
Talquetamab: Repeat-dose TK in cynomolgus monkeys (T-2016-027, Appendix 12) 
In an exploratory 4-week tolerability study, the toxicokinetic profile of talquetamab was assessed in 
cynomolgus monkeys (2 males and 1 female/group, except 1 male and 1 female in the control group) 
administered talquetamab weekly by a slow IV bolus at 0, 0.5, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg on Days 1, 8, 15, 
and 22 (T-2016-027/App12). Serum samples for toxicokinetic assessment were obtained from blood 
collected prior to each dose and at time points up to 120 hours after the Day 1 dose and 24 hours after 
the Day 22 dose (Table 6).

Table 7. Mean (SD) serum TK parameter estimates in cynomolgus monkeys administered 2 Weekly IV 
doses in an exploratory tolerability non-GLP study (T-2016-060) 
Sample collection was on Day 1 predose and postdose (2, 24, and 72 hours) and on Day 8 predose and postdose (2 
and 24 hours for all groups, 72 and 168 hours for 0.3 and 1 mg/kg groups, and 68 to 70 hours for the 10 mg/kg 
group).

Pivotal 1-month toxicity GLP study (T-2017-009) 
A pivotal 1-month toxicity GLP study characterised the toxicokinetic profile of the tool molecule 
administered at 0, 10, or 30 mg/kg by weekly IV slow bolus injection for a total of 4 doses to 
cynomolgus monkeys (3/sex/group). Serum samples for toxicokinetic assessment were obtained from 
blood collected prior to each dosing on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, on Day 1 up to 96 hours postdose (Day 
5), and on Day 22 up to 168 hours postdose (Day 29).  
Table 8. Mean (SD) serum toxicokinetic parameter estimates in cynomolgus monkeys administered 4 
weekly IV doses in a 1-Month toxicity GLP study (T-2017-009) 
Sample collection was Day 1 predose and postdose (1, 24, 48, and 96 hours), Days 8 and 15 predose, and Day 22 
predose and postdose (1, 24, 48, 96, and 168 hours). 
a AUCDay22-29 was estimated based on the data up to Day 23 for 1 female (#2501) or Day 24 for 3 males (#2001, 
#2002, #2003) since the concentration was below the lowest quantifiable concentration (0.16 µg/mL) toward the 
end of the dosing period. 
Serum samples for ADA assessment were obtained from blood collected on Day 1 predose and on Day 
22 predose and 168 hours postdose.  ADA was detected in 10 of 12 animals in the 10 and 30 mg/kg 
dose groups. When compared to ADA-negative animals in the same dose group, all ADA-positive 
animals exhibited either lower exposure prior to the last dose on Day 22 or faster concentration 
decrease after the first dose. Additionally, 3 of 6 control animals tested ADA-positive; however, the 
signals were just slightly above the screen cut-point and the titers were very low. Only 1 sample of the 
3 tested for ADA for each control animal was slightly above the method cut-point. 
Distribution, metabolism and excretion 
Traditional distribution studies were not submitted for talquetamab. Due to its molecular size of 
approximately 147kD, talquetamab is expected to be primarily confined to the vascular space with only 
limited distribution to the extracellular space, which is typical of IgG-based antibodies. 
As an IgG4 bispecific antibody, talquetamab is generally considered to be catabolised and eliminated 
by processes involved in the turnover and degradation of endogenous IgGs, and proteolytically 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023  
Page 38/155 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
degraded to constituent amino acids. Such compounds are proteolytically degraded to constituent 
amino acids, which can then be reincorporated into newly synthesised proteins or utilised as an energy 
source. Because they are not metabolised via CYP systems but are degraded to individual amino acids, 
no reactive metabolites are generated. Therefore, classical biotransformation studies as performed for 
small molecule pharmaceuticals are not required for therapeutic antibodies. 
Similar to other IgG-based antibodies, talquetamab is presumably eliminated via catabolic pathways 
that are typically associated with endogenous IgG. Thus, routine studies that attempt to assess mass 
balance are not expected to be informative. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
As an IgG-based bispecific antibody, talquetamab is not expected to undergo any direct metabolism-
based small molecule drug interactions and no pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were 
submitted. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose toxicity studies were conducted with either talquetamab or the tool molecule. Toxicity, 
after a single dose, was evaluated as part of the repeat- dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Moreover, safety parameters as physical examination, body weights, body temperature, blood 
pressure, heart/respiration rates were measured in the single-dose PK study (CP2017PK-002). No 
adverse findings were reported excepted minor common findings as alopecia, small aera of erythema, 
minor scabbed areas, bruises/abrasions, coloured faeces and deformity of the eyelids.  
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Talquetamab: Repeat-dose TK in cynomolgus monkeys (T-2016-027, Appendix 12).  
For description of the study see section 2.5.3 Pharmacokinetics of this report. Intravenous 
administration of talquetamab as 4 weekly doses was well tolerated in male and female cynomolgus 
monkeys at doses up to 30 mg/kg with no talquetamab-related adverse findings. Decreases in absolute 
T-helper and T-cytotoxic lymphocytes cell counts were observed in all animals group including control 
but at higher incidence in treated groups. These were related to talquetamab binding to CD3 and not 
considered adverse findings. 
Tool Molecule (JNJ-64024701): Exploratory 2-week tolerability non-GLP study in cynomolgus 
monkeys (T-2016-060) and of 1-month IV toxicity GLP study in cynomolgus monkeys (T-2017-009).  
For description of these studies see section 2.5.3 Pharmacokinetics of this report.  
The tool molecule was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys after weekly intravenous doses up to 30 
mg/kg. No treatment-related findings were observed.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with talquetamab are not required 
for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. 
Assessment report

2.5.4.4.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Although fertility studies have not been conducted with talquetamab, potential effects on fertility were 
evaluated based on the repeat-dose toxicity studies, in accordance with ICH S6(R1) and S9 guidelines. 
In the repeat-dose IV toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, no adverse effects on reproductive 
organs and tissues were observed macroscopically or microscopically following 4 weekly doses up to 30 
mg/kg (high dose) of talquetamab (JNJ-64407564) or the tool molecule (JNJ-64024701). 
Embryo-fetal development or enhanced pre- and postnatal development studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys with talquetamab or the tool molecule would not be feasible nor further inform pregnancy 
risk to multiple myeloma patients. The potential risks to the fetus, pregnant mother, and nursing infant 
are unknown.  
2.5.4.5.  Toxicokinetic data 
See pharmacokinetic section (2.5.3) of this report. 
2.5.4.6.  Local tolerance  
A single-dose SC local tolerability GLP study with talquetamab was performed in New Zealand White 
rabbits to support change from IV to SC administration in humans. 
The New Zealand White rabbit was chosen as the animal model for the local tolerance study because it 
is a generally accepted species for tolerability/irritancy testing and talquetamab is not sufficiently 
cross-reactive with common toxicology species. Rabbits are not a pharmacologically relevant species 
due to poor sequence homology of rabbit CD3 with human CD3; therefore, this study only assessed 
the tolerability of the formulation. There were no major findings or clinical observations in this study. 
2.5.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
Talquetamab was assessed in a series of in vitro assays to identify binding (and potential sites of 
toxicity) in a human tissue cross-reactivity study (Table 9).

either insufficient induction across the dose range or high 
donor-to-donor variability. 
IL-4 and IL-12p70 were not different than control. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Talquetamab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, no studies as part of the 
Environmental Risk Assessment for talquetamab are required. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology  
Talquetamab function requires the formation of a trimolecular complex by the binding to CD3 on T-
cells and to tumour associated antigen (GPRC5D) on target cells to elicit pharmacologic activity. The 
pharmacology characterisation of talquetamab demonstrated the bi-specific binding with high 
nanomolar affinity to GPRC5D and CD3, and that talquetamab selectively promoted the T-cell 
dependent elimination of human cells expressing GPRC5D on their surface in vitro and in vivo. The T-
cell mediated cytotoxic effect on GPRC5D-positive MM cells of talquetamab at nanomolar 
concentrations and induction of cytokine secretion was also demonstrated in physiologically relevant 
conditions. 
In xenograft mice tumour models, 0.005 mg/kg, 0. 5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg talquetamab doses (when 
delivered IP every 3 or 4 days for 7 total treatments post human PBCMCs implantation) significantly

inhibited the tumour growth by the study D36 of 65% - 100%. The duration of the response was not 
measured. Significant reduction of tumour growth was also noted in prophylactic xenograft tumour 
model (H929 GPRC5D+) with lower talquetamab doses, max 0.5 mg/kg. Although talquetamab failed 
in second therapeutic xenograft tumour model (other MM origin cells and use of human pan T-cell 
implantation), these studies provided the proof of concept for in vivo functionality for this bi-specific 
Mab. 
Cynomolgus monkey was initially selected as a pharmacologically relevant species. hGPRC5D shares 
96% sequence homology with cGPRC5D; however, talquetamab was shown not to bind the 
cynomolgus monkey target molecule cGPRC5D. A tool molecule (JNJ-64024701) was therefore used 
and presented similar binding to cGPRC5D than talquetamab to hGPRC5D. The functional activities of 
talquetamab and the tool molecule was demonstrated in vitro and were similar. Although the 
cynomolgus monkey could be considered as a pharmacologically relevant animal species for evaluation 
of toxicity with the tool molecule administration, results from studies in normal healthy monkeys (in 
which only very low amounts of GPRC5D cells are present and uncertainty regarding the similarity of 
GPRC5D expression outside the tumor between monkey an human) may have limited translatability to 
multiple myeloma patients, and the toxicity data should be interpreted with caution. 
The pharmacology of talquetamab has been adequately characterised and enhanced T cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity through recruitment of CD3-expressing T cells to GPRC5D-expressing cells is reflected in 
the SmPC.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical pharmacokinetics programme characterised the pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic profile 
and an impact of ADA on systemic exposure of talquetamab IV in cynomolgus monkeys following a 
single dose of 0.5 or 5 mg/kg or 4 weekly doses of 0.5, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg. In addition, since 
talquetamab is not pharmacologically active in monkeys, the tool molecule which is expected to be 
active is also administrated in monkey. No exploratory PK study was performed. The PK parameters of 
the tool molecule was collected during the two toxicity studies performed after 2 weekly doses of 0.3, 
1, or 10 mg/kg or 4 weekly doses of 10, or 30 mg/kg in monkeys.   
Serum talquetamab and tool molecule exposure, Cmax and AUC (within 1 dose interval) increased with 
dose in an approximately dose-proportional manner in cynomolgus monkeys after single or repeated 
doses. No differences between male and females were observed. The volume of distribution of 
talquetamab in cynomolgus monkeys in the single-dose pharmacokinetic study ranged from 137.37 to 
160.76 mL/kg. The serum half-life of talquetamab was estimated to be 9 to 12 days in cynomolgus 
monkeys. No half-life was measured for the tool molecule. 
Formation of ADA was clearly triggered by talquetamab and tool molecule. ADAs were detected in most 
of the talquetamab-treated animals (10 out of 12 animals) in pivotal repeated dose 
toxicology/toxicokinetic study. Development of ADAs resulted in reduced exposure and/or faster 
concentration decrease after the last dose in treated animals. 
Traditional distribution studies were not conducted for talquetamab, which is an antibody with a 
molecular weight of 147 kDa. Due to its molecular size, talquetamab is expected to be primarily 
confined to the vascular space with only limited distribution to the extracellular space, which is typical 
for IgG-based mAbs. As an IgG-based antibody, talquetamab is presumed to be catabolised and 
eliminated by processes involved in the turnover and degradation of endogenous IgGs.  
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were conducted, which is acceptable. 
Talquetamab/tool molecule pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics characterisation is considered sufficient.

Toxicology 
Talquetamab and the tool molecule was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys up to highest dose 
tested (30 mg/kg). Indeed, talquetamab did not bind cGPRC5D, a tool molecule was identified which 
binds cGPRC5D and cCD3 with similar affinity and generated similar in vitro PD activity than in 
humans. Therefore, the tool molecule was administrated in cynomolgus monkey to represent a 
pharmacologic model. However, the applicant stated that weak PD activity of the tool molecule was 
observed in 2-week and pivotal 4-week studies. As the model used is healthy animal in which only very 
low amounts of GPRC5D-positive cells are present, it is not clear which PD activity was expected. 
Moreover, in 4-week pivotal study raw data on immunophenotyping were not analysed.  Indeed, the 
results was not interpreted or reported due to recorded issues.  
The limited PD effect observed in healthy monkey was expected and is not considered as an acceptable 
argument to omit the 13-week study. However, considering the reduced exposure and/or faster 
elimination of JNJ-64024701 due to ADA presence in almost all animals at this end of the study, it is 
obvious that a longer animal study with the tool molecule will add no additional value in the toxicity 
characterisation profile of talquetamab.  
The overall toxicology data package is thus considered adequate. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view Talvey (talquetamab) has been adequately characterised and is 
recommended for marketing authorisation.

Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was used to estimate talquetamab PK parameters and descriptive 
statistics of PK parameters were calculated for each dose levels. For IV and SC administration PK 
parameters included were AUCtau, Cmax, Tmax, t½, CL and V for IV and apparent clearance or 
volume (CL/F or Vd/F) for SC.

Population PK model 
Population pharmacokinetics (Pop-PK) modelling (Report EDMS-RIM-736096) was conducted using the 
nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. This analysis was based on serum concentration data collected from 
Part 1 (Phase 1 dose escalation), Part 2 (Dose expansion at RP2D), and Part 3 (Phase 2) of the pivotal 
phase 1/2 Study 64407564MMY1001 (MonumenTAL-1) with the PK data cutoff on 22 April 2022. 
A total of 5354 measurable serum talquetamab concentration from 492 patients with relapsed or 
refractory multiple myeloma who received at least 1 talquetamab dose were used for the nonlinear 
mixed-effects modelling. This included 100 subjects (1928 PK observations) who received talquetamab 
IV administration from 0.0005 to 0.00338 mg/kg Q2W and from 0.0015 to 0.18 mg/kg weekly; and 
392 patients (3426 PK observations) who received SC administration. Among the subjects who 
received SC administration, 333 received one of the 2 claimed dosing regimens [0.4 mg/kg weekly or 
0.8 mg/kg Q2W] with or without concomitant T cell or bispecific antibody therapy contributing (2538 
PK observations) 
The observed concentration-time data of talquetamab after SC administration were adequately 
described by a 2-compartment mammillary model with sequential zero and first-order absorption and 2 
parallel and linear time-independent (representing the nonspecific clearance for IgG) and time-
dependent (representing changes in capacity of the target-mediated clearance) clearance components. 
The model was parameterised in terms of time-independent clearance (CL1), time-dependent clearance 
(CLt), volume of distribution of the central compartment (V1), inter-compartmental clearance (Q), 
volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment (V2), first-order absorption rate constant (Ka), 
and SC bioavailability (F). The model was parameterised in terms of total clearance at time t=0 (CL0), 
fraction clearance at steady state described by the time-independent clearance component (CLPCT), 
first-order decay coefficient of the time-dependent clearance (KDES), volume of distribution of the 
central compartment (V1), inter-compartmental clearance (Q), volume of distribution of the peripheral 
compartment (V2), first-order absorption rate constant (Ka), SC bioavailability (F), and input duration 
of SC administration (D1).  
The covariates assessed in the population pharmacokinetic analysis included demographic 
characteristics (body weight, age, sex, race, region, ethnicity), disease characteristics and biomarkers 
(baseline total T cells, baseline soluble BCMA, baseline bone marrow percent plasma cells, baseline 
plasmacytoma, baseline type of myeloma, baseline lesion number, baseline lytic lesion, baseline 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] status, baseline International Staging System [ISS] 
staging, baseline revised ISS staging, cytogenetic risk, experiencing CRS events or not), clinical 
laboratory characteristics (baseline creatinine clearance, baseline albumin, baseline alanine 
aminotransferase, baseline alkaline phosphatase, renal function, hepatic function), prior treatment and 
refractory status (prior use of anti-CD38 antibodies, prior use of daratumumab, prior use of anti-
programmed cell death protein 1 [PD1]/anti‑programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1], prior use of anti-
BCMA treatment, triple refractory status, penta-refractory status, number of prior lines of therapies 
[≤4 vs >4]), concurrent use of tocilizumab, prior autologous or allogenic transplantation, use of human 
Ig). 
After the covariate selection procedure, the covariate effects retained in the final model were the effect 
of body weight BW on CL0 and V1 and myeloma subtype (IgG versus non-IgG) and ISS stage (II and 
III versus I) on CL0. Other covariates tested were not statistically significant. 
The parameters of the final PopPK model with importance resampling results are summarised in Table 
13.

To assess the impact of covariates on the systemic exposure of talquetamab for patients in study 
MonumenTAL-1, subgroup analyses were conducted on predicted systemic exposure based on the 
individual pharmacokinetic parameters from the final PopPK following the two studied RP2Ds dosing 
regimens RP2Ds [i.e 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC preceded by step-up dose schedule 0.01 and 0.06 mg/kg on 
days -4 and -2 respectively before the full dose on day 0, and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC preceded by step-up 
dose schedule 0.01 and 0.06 and 0.3 mg/kg on days -6, -4 and -2 respectively before the full dose on 
day 0].  
No clinically meaningful differences (i.e., <20-30%) in the exposure to talquetamab were observed in 
subjects with different body weight when talquetamab was administered on the weight-based dosing 
regimen. Exposure of talquetamab largely overlapped across body weight subgroups, even a tendency 
of increase on systemic exposure is expected (geometric mean ratio of: 1.2 with CI95%: [1.1-1.4]) in 
heavier patients with BW > 87.7 kg.

The disease status variables including multiple myeloma type (non-IgG versus IgG) and ISS staging (II 
versus I and III versus I) affected the systemic exposure of talquetamab. The simulated Cavg,4weeks at 
the two RP2Ds 0.4 mg/kg weekly and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W were 90 and 100% higher in patients with non-
IgG subtype of multiple myeloma compared with those with IgG subtype of multiple myeloma, and 
they were approximately 20 to 30% lower in participants with ISS Stage II/III when comparing with 
ISS Stage I. With regard to the multiple myeloma subtype, this covariate was later also identified as a 
significant factor associated with clinical efficacy ORR endpoint and thus confounded with systemic 
exposures.  
Based on the total PK population of n=492 with both IV and SC doses, patients with presence of 
treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) (n=91 positive, 18.5%), mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment (N=76, 15.4% mild and moderate), mild or moderate renal impairment (based on MDRD 
eGFR, 231 [47%] mild, 142 [28.9%] moderate), age (33 to 86 years old), sex, race and geographical 
region did not result in clinically meaningful differences (ie, <20%) in exposures. 
Absorption  
Following SC administration of talquetamab at 400 µg/kg QW Tmax is generally achieved at 2 days 
with mean Cmax of 3799 ng/mL and mean AUC of 607.3 µg.h/mL. 
Following SC administration of talquetamab at 800 µg/kg Q2W Tmax is generally achieved at 2.8 days 
with mean Cmax of 4161 ng/mL and mean AUC of 1021 µg.h/mL. 
SC bioavailability was estimated by calculating the ratio of the mean-dose normalised AUCtau (18.1 
ng.h/mL) observed at Cycle 3 Day 1 in the RP2D cohort of 0.405 mg/kg SC QW with the dose 
normalised AUCtau (24.5 ng.h/mL) at Cycle 3 Day 1 of the cohort IV QW. This resulted in an 
approximation of the SC bioavailability of 74% for the RP2D cohort.  
Based on the PopPK analysis, SC bioavailability was estimated at 62%.  
Distribution 
Typical mAbs are primarily confined in the vascular system. Based on NCA, at Cycle 3 Day 1 for 
approximately a 400 µg/kg dose (405 µg/kg), mean Vd/F was 9.34 L, and for a 800 µg/kg dose, 13.1 
L. Based on PopPK analysis, typical V1 was 4.3 L. V1 increased with body weight with an allometric 
exponent of 0.67. The typical V2 was estimated to be 5.78 L. 
Elimination 
Based on the PopPK analysis, the elimination of talquetamab was described by parallel linear CL1 and 
linear CLt (CLt=CL2·exp[-KDES·Time], where CL2 is the time-dependent clearance at time 0. The CL1 
component is thought to reflect the endogenous catabolic processes of IgG degradation. The CLt 
component corresponds to the decrease in drug clearance as disease status improves over time post-
treatment, which may be related to tumour burden or target amount, disease severity, or 
improvement of cancer-related cachexia, as a result of talquetamab treatment, similarly to nivolumab, 
teclistamab, and daratumumab.  
Typical total clearance was 2.08 L/day at initial treatment and 1.06 L/day at steady state for 
participants with IgG subtype of myeloma and ISS stage I, and KDES was 0.0229 d-1. The median 
terminal phase t1/2 based on the post-hoc parameters of all SC populations (n=392) was 7.56 d at 
initial treatment, and 12.2 d at steady state.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following talquetamab SC administration, exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased in an approximately 
dose-proportional manner at Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 across the range of 0.005 mg/kg to 0.8 mg/kg QW 
and 0.8 mg/kg to 1.2 mg/kg Q2W. 
Following SC administration, for weekly dosing schedule in Cycle 3, the mean accumulation ratio of 
Cmax was 3.9 and 4.5 for AUCtau. For Q2W dosing schedule at Cycle 3, the mean accumulation ratio 
of Cmax was 2.33 and 2.17 for AUCtau. Steady state seems to be achieved at week 16. 
Inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability (CV%) in CL0, V1, V2, F and Ka was estimated to be 52%, 22%, 83%, 81% 
and 66%, respectively, based on PopPK model estimates (Table 13). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment as defined using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula 
(normal [n=119, 24.2%], mild [n=231, 47%], moderate [n=142, 24.7%], and severe [n=0, 0%]) was 
evaluated in Pop-PK analysis and was not identified as significant covariate on talquetamab systemic 
exposure. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment as defined using the National Cancer Institute criteria (normal 
[n=414, 84.1%], mild [n=74, 15.0%], moderate [n=2, 0.4%], and severe [n=0, 0%]) was evaluated 
in the Pop-PK analysis. Hepatic impairment (mild or moderate) was not identified as a significant 
covariate on talquetamab systemic exposure. 
Gender 
The effect of sex on the PKs of talquetamab was evaluated in Pop-PK analysis. Approximately 57.3% of 
the patients included in the dataset were male (n=282). The covariate analyses showed that sex had 
no significant effect on PK parameters. 
Race 
In the Pop-PK analysis, race or ethnicity was not identified to significantly influence the PKs of 
talquetamab. The composition of patients included in the analysis dataset were White (n=424, 86.2%), 
Black (n=43, 8.7%), Asian (n=11, 2.2%), or others (n=14, 2.8%). 
Weight 
In the Pop-PK analysis, BW effect was included as allometric scaling component on the total clearance 
at start of treatment (CL0) and volume of distribution parameters with estimated exponents of 0.672 
and 0.67, respectively. 
Elderly 
The effect of age (median: 65 years; range: 33 to 86 years) on talquetamab PK was assessed in Pop-
PK analysis. The covariate analyses showed that age had no significant effect on the PK parameters.  
The number of elderly subjects included in the PK analysis is shown in Table 14.

PK Trials 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
PBPK model 
A PBPK model was developed to evaluate the potential influence of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) serum levels on 
the exposure of various CYP substrates, including caffeine (CYP1A2), s-warfarin (CYP2C9), omeprazole 
(CYP2C19), midazolam and cyclosporine (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5), and simvastatin (CYP3A4), for two 
dosing regimens of talquetamab (400 ug/kg weekly subcutaneous (SC) treatment dose and 800 
ug/kg). The study also assessed the time taken to achieve the maximum change in CYP activity due to 
IL-6, as well as the time required to return to 80% of the baseline enzymatic activity, with Cycle 1 as 
the reference point. The simulations aimed to analyse the impact of IL-6, resulting from talquetamab 
administration, on CYP substrates and provide recommendations for clinical monitoring of co-
medication of CYP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index in the label. 
Based on the results of PBPK modelling and simulation, the highest risk of drug-drug interaction occurs 
when initiating the step-up dose of talquetamab within 1 to 7 days after the first treatment dose, or 
during a CRS event, for the 400 ug/kg weekly SC dosing regimen. Similarly, for the 800 ug/kg Q2W SC 
dosing regimen, the highest risk of drug-drug interaction occurs when initiating the step-up dose of 
talquetamab within 1 to 9 days after the first treatment dose or during a CRS event.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Talquetamab is a novel, humanised IgG4 bispecific antibody designed to target the CD3 receptor 
complex on T cells and on GPRC5D multiple myeloma cells, resulting in T cell activation and 
subsequent lysis of GPRC5D-expressing multiple myeloma cells. As a stable bispecific IgG molecule 
generated through controlled fragment antigen binding arm exchange following the method reported 
by Labrin 2013, talquetamab is able to draw T cells in close proximity to myeloma cells, without regard 
to T cell receptor specificity or reliance on major histocompatibility complex Class 1 molecules on the 
surface of antigen presenting cells for activation. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
To determine if treatment with talquetamab results in increased antitumor activity by redirected T cell-
mediated killing of GPRC5D-expressing multiple myeloma cells and increased activation of cytotoxic T 
cells, serum and whole blood samples were collected to evaluate sBCMA (as a potential surrogate 
marker of tumour burden) as well as cytokines and immune cell populations by flow cytometry as 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers of immune activation.  
Soluble B cell maturation antigen 
A correlation between reduction of sBCMA and overall best response for the whole treatment was 
observed in Phase 1. Following talquetamab IV or SC administration in Phase 1, 83 of 85 responders 
(97.6%) and 52 of 87 non-responders (59.8%) showed a decrease in sBCMA at Cycle 2 Day 1 
compared with their respective baseline values. In addition, a greater reduction in sBCMA was 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023

observed in participants with deeper responses to talquetamab (Figure 10). 
Figure 10. Percentage change from baseline in soluble BCMA at Cycle 2 Day 1 by best response as 
assessed by investigator (Phase 1) (Study 64407564MMY1001) (Pharmacokinetics analysis set)  
Cytokines  
Cytokine induction was observed following initial doses. No statistically significant association was 
observed between treatment response and maximum fold change in IL-6, IFN γ, TNF-α, IL-10, or 
soluble IL 2Rα. A trend was observed for higher induction of IL-6, IL-10, and soluble IL 2Rα in 
responders compared with non-responders. 
T cell activation  
T cell activation was observed following initial doses of talquetamab in patients treated at the 0.8 
mg/kg biweekly dose. No statistically significant association was observed between treatment response 
and maximum fold change in expression of CD25, CD38, HLA-DR, LAG 3, PD 1, or TIM-3 on CD4+ or 
CD8+ T cells. A trend was observed for higher induction of LAG-3 or TIM-3 on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in 
responders compared to non-responders.

T cell redistribution  
For treated participants assigned to the 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC RP2D or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC RP2D and 
treated participants with prior T cell redirection therapies assigned to either RP2D, T-cell redistribution 
was demonstrated by reduction in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after the initial dose of 
talquetamab. 
B cells 
No significant changes in CD19+ B cell levels were observed within the first cycle for treated 
participants assigned to the 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC RP2D or the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC RP2D and treated 
participants with prior T cell redirection therapies assigned to either RP2D. Increased CD19+ B cell 
levels were noted beginning at Cycle 3 for treated participants assigned to the 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC 
RP2D and beginning at Cycle 2 for treated participants assigned to the0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC RP2D and 
treated participants with prior T cell redirection therapies assigned to either RP2D 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Talquetamab exhibited approximately dose-proportional pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous 
administration across a dose ranging from 0.005 to 0.8 mg/kg weekly (0.0125 to 2 times the 
recommended 0.4 mg/kg weekly dose) and from 0.8 mg/kg to 1.2 mg/kg biweekly (1.0 to 1.5 times 
the recommended 0.8 mg/kg biweekly dose).  
The mean accumulation ratio between the 1st and 7th weekly dose of talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg was 3.9- 
and 4.5-fold for Cmax and AUCtau, respectively. The mean accumulation ratio between the 1st and 5th 
biweekly dose of talquetamab 0.8 mg/kg was 2.3- and 2.2-fold for Cmax and AUCtau, respectively. 
However, the applicant noted that the developed method for the quantification of talquetamab 
concentration in human serum was not specific and different results may have been observed with 
selection of a different reagent. Therefore, it is recommended that the applicant develops a specific 
method of quantification of talquetamab in human serum (by using another tool reagent) as part of its 
ongoing clinical development programme. 
Population PK analysis 
The developed Pop-PK model, a two-compartment model with both time-varying and time-independent 
clearance components, appears to adequately describe the whole features of observed PK data.  
Based on the population pharmacokinetic model, the typical value of the bioavailability of talquetamab 
was 62% when administered subcutaneously relative to intravenous dosing. 
At 0.4 mg/kg weekly dose regimen, the median (range) Tmax of talquetamab after the 1st and 7th 
treatment doses were 3 (1 to 8) days and 2 (1 to 6) days, respectively. 
At 0.8 mg/kg biweekly (every 2 weeks) dose regimen, the median (range) Tmax of talquetamab after 
the 1st and 5th treatment doses were 3 (2 to 14) days and 3 (1 to 8) days, respectively. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic model, the typical value of the volume of distribution was 
4.3 L (22% CV [coefficient of variation]) for the central compartment, and 5.8 L (83% CV) for the 
peripheral compartment. 
Talquetamab exhibited both linear time-independent and time-dependent clearance. Based on the 
population pharmacokinetic model and the post hoc parameters of participants receiving SC doses 
(N=392), the median total clearance is 1.64 L/day at initial treatment and 0.80 L/day at steady state. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023  
Page 53/155 
 
 
 
 
 
The time-dependent clearance accounted for 48.8% of total clearance at initial treatment and then 
decreased exponentially to < 5% at around Week 16. The concentration-time profile at Week 16 would 
reach 90% of steady-state concentration for both 0.4 mg/kg weekly and 0.8 mg/kg biweekly regimens. 
The median terminal phase half-life was 7.56 days at initial treatment, and 12.2 days at steady state. 
In addition to the effects of BW on PK, the Pop-PK analysis only found that the type of multiple 
myeloma (IgG vs non-IgG) and International Staging System score were predictors of talquetamab 
clearance. The simulated Cave,4weeks at the two RP2Ds 0.4 mg/kg weekly and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W were 
approximately 90 and 100% higher in patients with non-IgG subtype of multiple myeloma compared 
with those with IgG subtype of multiple myeloma.  Further clinical efficacy subgroup analyses and E-R 
analyses clarified that instead of systemic exposures, myeloma subtype (non-IgG versus IgG) was the 
covariate of ORR and therefore no dose adjustment is warranted based on multiple myeloma subtype. 
Bodyweight is taken into account by the use of mg/kg dosing. 
The applicant proposes no dosing adjustment for any special populations. These recommendations are 
overall acceptable and are justified by the results of the Pop-PK PK analyses, together with exposure-
response analyses (see also Clinical Efficacy section of this report). However, it should be noted that 
only limited data (n=2) is available in participants with moderate hepatic impairment while no data are 
available in participants with severe hepatic or renal impairment. 
Talquetamab is not metabolised via CYP enzymes and is not expected to directly affect CYP enzymes. 
Therefore, the absence of specific clinical DDI studies could be acceptable. However, cytokine release 
that occurs during CRS may transiently downregulate CYP enzymes.  
PBPK model 
A PBPK modelling and simulation was used to evaluate the potential influence of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) 
serum levels on the exposure of various CYP substrates. The simulations aimed to analyse the impact 
of IL-6, resulting from talquetamab administration, on CYP substrates and provide recommendations 
for clinical monitoring of co-medication of CYP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index in the label. 
According to the PBPK model results, the impact of talquetamab on the exposure of omeprazole, 
midazolam, simvastatin, and cyclosporine, which are substrates for CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5, 
was found to be weak to moderate. Additionally, the impact on the exposure of caffeine, which is a 
substrate for CYP1A2, was minimal.  
Talquetamab causes release of cytokines that may suppress activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes, potentially resulting in increased exposure of CYP substrates. The highest risk of drug-drug 
interaction is expected to occur from initiation of talquetamab step-up phase up to 9 days after the 
first treatment dose and during and after CRS. It is therefore recommended to monitor for toxicity or 
concentrations of drugs that are CYP (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5, CYP2D6) substrates where 
minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. The dose of concomitant CYP 
(e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5, CYP2D6) substrate drugs should be adjusted as needed. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has adequately characterised the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 
talquetamab which therefore can be recommended for (conditional) marketing authorisation.

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
Starting dose rationale 
The initial IV dose proposed for the Phase 1 Study 64407564MMY1001 was based on estimation of the 
minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL). This was calculated using the lowest mean 
concentration associated with the 20% maximal drug effect (EC20) from the T cell activation in the 
whole blood assay with the multiple myeloma cell line H929 (see also Section 2.5.2 of this report). The 
identified MABEL (0.083 nM) resulted in a recommended starting dose of 0.0005 mg/kg as an 
approximately 4-hour infusion Q2W. 
Rationale for weekly dosing 
Dose escalation for the weekly IV cohorts began at a starting dose level that was already determined 
to be safe for Q2W IV dosing, and the subsequent dose levels were selected based on a statistical 
model using all available data to identify safe and tolerable RP2Ds, defined as the dose(s) and 
schedule(s) of talquetamab for characterisation in Part 2. Preliminary first dose pharmacokinetics 
results from the first 5 cohorts (dose range 0.0005 to 0.00338 mg/kg) following Q2W IV dosing with 
talquetamab in Study 64407564MMY1001 showed that talquetamab levels were high at (end of 
infusion after IV flush) EOI and declined quickly with terminal t1/2 ranging from approximately 2 to 6 
days. The pharmacokinetics data from the Q2W cohorts suggested that participants may not have had 
sufficient talquetamab exposure beyond Day 8 following the first dose with Q2W IV dosing. Thus, 
increasing the IV dosing frequency from Q2W to weekly allowed for more sustained talquetamab 
exposure over the intended dosing interval. Based on the safety profile and preliminary 
pharmacokinetics data, weekly IV dosing with talquetamab was initiated and selected for further 
exploration. 
Rationale for subcutaneous dosing 
In Study 64407564MMY1001, SC injection of talquetamab, which is shorter in duration compared with 
IV administration (IV infusion duration of 2 to 4 hours), as well as having more sustained 
concentration-time profiles, was evaluated for the convenience of patients and healthcare providers. 
The systemic exposure of talquetamab is expected to be lower with SC administration than with IV 
infusion. Preliminary modelling of the available talquetamab pharmacokinetics data following IV 
infusion, using a 2-compartment model, as well as simulation to predict the exposure following SC 
administration (assuming 60% F and Tmax at 48 or 72 hours) were conducted to compare the 
exposure from IV (observed) and SC (simulated) dosing. The simulation demonstrated that the Cmax 
following a 0.0015 mg/kg SC administration on Day -7 was more than 3-fold lower than the observed 
Cmax following the 0.0015 mg/kg IV step-up dose. Simulated Cmax following the first SC full dose of 
0.005 mg/kg on Day 1 was approximately more than 2-fold lower than the observed Cmax following 
the first IV full dose of 0.00338 mg/kg on Day 1. Thus, the initial SC dose was a 0.0015 mg/kg step-up 
dose on Day -7, followed by a full dose of 0.005 mg/kg administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21-day 
cycle. This SC dose and schedule was initiated after the 0.005 mg/kg weekly IV cohort was deemed to 
be safe by the study evaluation team. 
Rationale for recommended phase 2 dose 
In Phase 1, 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC achieved exposures consistently above the 
maximum EC90, activation of T cells and induction of cytokines, a clinically manageable safety profile, 
and compelling efficacy. In the SC cohorts, ORR and DOR generally increased up to the RP2Ds of 0.4 
mg/kg weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC. Although lower doses such as 0.135 mg/kg weekly SC also 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023  
Page 55/155 
 
 
 
 
showed activity with responses in several participants at these doses, fewer participants achieved 
VGPR or better, and DOR tended to be shorter at these doses compared with the putative RP2Ds. 
Efficacy and safety data for higher doses did not support the benefit-risk of further dose escalation. 
Based on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy data available from Phase 1, the 
optimised treatment doses for talquetamab monotherapy (0.4 mg/kg weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W 
SC, after step-up dosing) were selected as the RP2Ds for further evaluation in Phase 2. Results from 
Phase 2 further established 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC as safe and effective dose 
regimens for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
Exposure-response (E-R) relationship 
- 
Phase 1 Overall Response Rate, Duration of Response, and Progression-free Survival for 
Participants in Phase 1 (Pooled Phase 1 RP2D and Non-RP2D SC Cohorts) 
In Phase 1, the ORR was assessed by the investigator (IMWG 2011 criteria). A positive E-R relationship 
in Phase 1 participants receiving talquetamab SC (n=134) between ORR and Cave, 4 weeks was observed. 
ORR increased with talquetamab exposure across SC doses below the RP2Ds and reaching a plateau at 
or above the RP2Ds (data not shown). Based on the Phase 1 E-R relationship and derived 
pharmacokinetic exposures, it can be concluded that the RP2Ds are better than below the RP2Ds, and 
there was no additional increase in response rate using above the RP2Ds. Other pharmacokinetic 
metrics such as Ctrough,1stdose showed a similar trend as Cave,4 weeks.(data not shown). 
The E-R analyses for DOR and PFS in participants in Phase 1 were conducted. The Kaplan-Meier plots 
for DOR showed overlapping CIs and no statistically significant relationship with all investigated 
pharmacokinetic metrics (data not shown). PFS plots showed significant E-R relationship at higher 
exposures (2nd to 4th quartiles, corresponding to RP2Ds and >RP2Ds) correlating with longer PFS (data 
not shown). These results support the selection of the two RP2Ds. 
-  Recommended Phase 2 Doses (0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC) Overall 
Response Rate 
The ORR E-R relationship for participants without prior T cell redirection therapy at RP2Ds of 0.4 mg/kg 
weekly SC and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC (by IMWG 2016 criteria and by IRC) with at least 3 months follow-
up (treated on or prior to 15 February 2022 for 0.8 mg/kg Q2W; n=254) was performed. Responders 
and non-responders had comparable pharmacokinetic exposures. Near flat E-R relationships were 
observed between ORR and Cave,4 weeks. Other pharmacokinetic metrics, Ctrough,1stdose, Cavg, 1stdose, 
Cavg, 2weeks, and Cavg, 3rd-4th weeks, also showed similar near flat E-R relationships (data not shown). 
The association between talquetamab pharmacokinetic exposure and ORR was not statistically 
significant in univariate and multivariate E-R modelling for Cavg, 4 weeks and other investigated 
pharmacokinetic metrics. These results suggest participants had sufficient exposure for achieving 
response. 
Prognostic factors of Ig subtype of myeloma (higher ORR in participants with non-IgG) and 
extramedullary plasmacytomas (higher ORR in participants without extramedullary plasmacytomas) 
were identified from subgroup analysis and multivariable analysis as factors that could affect ORR. Of 
these 2 prognostic factors, the Ig subtype of myeloma was confounding and associated with the 
change in exposures (higher exposure in participants with non-IgG subtype). Additional E-R analysis 
stratified by Ig subtype of myeloma showed a plateaued E-R relationship in participants with non-IgG 
or IgG subtype (data not shown) and clarified that instead of pharmacokinetic exposure values, the 
subtype of myeloma had an impact on ORR, confirming the results from multivariable E-R analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023  
Page 56/155 
 
 
 
 
Of note, E-R analysis did not identify dose schedule (weekly SC vs Q2W SC) as a significant covariate 
for ORR at the RP2Ds, suggesting comparable ORR resulting from either RP2D dose of 0.4 mg/kg 
weekly or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W. 
The Kaplan-Meier plots show overlapping CIs and no statistically significant relationship with quartiles 
of all investigated pharmacokinetic metrics (data not shown). These plots indicated a plateaued 
relationship between pharmacokinetic exposures and DOR/PFS at the RP2Ds. 
A Cox proportional hazard model showed that exposure was not associated with OS (data not shown). 
ISS stage (higher hazard rate for higher ISS stage) and extramedullary plasmacytoma (higher hazard 
rate) were 2 prognostic factors for OS in the RP2Ds.

in Phase 1: a treatment dose of 0.405 mg/kg weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21-day cycle (preceded 
by step-up doses of 0.01 and 0.06 mg/kg before Cycle 1 Day 1); or a treatment dose of 0.8 mg/kg 
Q2W on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle (preceded by step-up doses of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.3 mg/kg 
before Cycle 1 Day 1). 
For Part 3 (Phase 2), talquetamab was administered SC at the 2 RP2Ds confirmed in Part 2. In Cohort 
A and Cohort B, the step-up schedule was talquetamab SC at 0.01 and 0.06 mg/kg, separated by 2 to 
4 days and to be completed 2 to 4 days before the first weekly treatment dose of 0.4 mg/kg. In this 
part of the study, the RP2D dose of 0.405 mg/kg was adjusted to 0.4 mg/kg for operational 
convenience, with similar exposure to talquetamab; “0.4 mg/kg weekly SC” in this report refers to 
results for both the Phase 1 dose and the Phase 2 dose. The treatment dose schedule for Cohorts A 
and B was Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle. In Cohort C, the step-up schedule was 
talquetamab SC at 0.01, 0.06, and 0.3 mg/kg, each separated by 2 to 4 days and to be completed 2 to 
4 days before the first Q2W treatment dose of 0.8 mg/kg. The treatment dose schedule for Cohort C 
was Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle.

•  Objectives (Phase 2 (Part 3)) 
Primary Objective 
•  To evaluate the efficacy of talquetamab at the RP2Ds 
Secondary Objectives 
•  To further assess the efficacy of talquetamab at the RP2Ds 
•  To evaluate MRD at the RP2Ds 
•  To further assess the safety and tolerability of talquetamab at the RP2Ds 
•  To characterise the pharmacokinetics of talquetamab at the RP2Ds 
•  To assess the immunogenicity of talquetamab 
•  To assess PROs after treatment with talquetamab 
•  To evaluate the efficacy of talquetamab in high-risk molecular subgroups 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of 
participants who achieved a partial response (PR) or better according to the International Myeloma 
Working Group (IMWG) 2016 response criteria, as assessed by an Independent Review Committee 
(IRC).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints were duration of response (DOR), very good partial response (VGPR) or 
better rate, CR or better rate, time to response (TTR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival 
(OS), minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate, and ORR in participants with high-risk 
cytogenetics. 
DOR was calculated among responders (with a PR or better response) from the date of initial 
documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive 
disease, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to progressive disease, whichever occurs first. 
Relapse from CR was not considered as disease progression. For subjects who have not progressed, 
data were censored at the last disease evaluation before the start of any subsequent anti-myeloma 
therapy. 
TTR was defined as the time between date of first dose of study drug and the first efficacy evaluation 
that the subject has met all criteria for PR or better. For subjects without response, data were 
censored either at the date of progressive disease, or in the absence of progressive disease, at the last 
disease evaluation before the start of subsequent anti-myeloma therapy. 
PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documented 
disease progression, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
For subjects who had not progressed and are alive, data will be censored at the last disease evaluation 
before the start of any subsequent anti-myeloma therapy. 
OS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of the subject’s death. 
If the subject was alive or the vital status is unknown, then the subject’s data will be censored at the 
date the subject was last known to be alive. 
MRD-negative rate was defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved MRD negative status to a 
threshold of 10-5 at any timepoint after initial dose of talquetamab and before disease progression or 
starting subsequent therapy.

•  Sample size 
The sample size planned was 260 subjects in the phase 1 part and 320 subjects in the phase 2 part 
(120 in cohort A, 100 in cohort B and 100 in cohort C); there was no formal justification of the sample 
size for the phase 1 part of the trial (dose escalation and expansion). For cohort A, B and C, sample 
sizes were based on the following targeted clinical responses:  
45% ORR observed in cohort A to declare a higher rate than 30% with 90% power ; 35% ORR 
observed in cohort B to declare a higher rate than 15% with 80% power (in a 2-stage design) – this 
sample size could be increased to at least 60 subjects to have a more accurate estimate ; 45% ORR 
observed in cohort C to declare a higher rate than 30% with 85% power – all above null hypotheses 
were tested with a 2.5% one-sided type-one error. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
•  Statistical methods 
Overall response rate (ORR) will be tabulated together with its two-sided 95% exact CI. The ORR 
calculation will include all talquetamab-treated subjects (subjects whose response is not evaluable will 
be considered as not having responded for the purposes of the ORR calculation).  
For the time-to-event endpoints, including DOR, PFS, TTNT, and OS, the Kaplan-Meier method will be 
used for descriptive summaries. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint for Part 3, ORR (PR or better), in Cohort A will be conducted 
approximately 6 months after 120 subjects in Cohort A have received an initial dose of talquetamab. 
The analysis of ORR in Cohort B will be conducted after the response can be assessed for the last 
subject in Cohort B. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint for Part 3, ORR (PR or better), in Cohort C will be conducted 
approximately 6 months after approximately 100 subjects have received an initial dose of SC 
talquetamab 800 μg/kg biweekly. 
The ORR and its 95% exact CI will be calculated and statistical significance for ORR will be achieved if 
the lower bound of the confidence interval for ORR in Cohort A and Cohort C is greater than 30% and 
the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for ORR in Cohort B is greater than 15%. Analysis of 
VGPR or better response rate, CR or better response rate, sCR rate, MRD negative rate, DOR, TTR, 
PFS, TTNT, and OS will be conducted at the same time as the analysis of ORR, and an update of these 
endpoints will be provided at the end of the study, which is planned to occur 2 years after the last 
subject has received his or her initial dose of talquetamab or when the last subject has completed the 
last study assessment in the study, whichever occurs first. 
Interim Analysis 
In Part 3, Stage 1 analysis was planned to be performed for Cohort B when approximately 21 response 
evaluable subjects were enrolled in Cohort B and the response for the last patient in Stage 1 can be 
assessed. Further enrolment may be terminated if 3 or fewer responses are observed in the first stage. 
Otherwise, additional subjects will be enrolled to ensure 34 response-evaluable subjects with 2 stages 
combined. Assuming 10% non-response-evaluable rate, a total of 38 subjects will be planned.

therapy who were assigned to the RP2D of 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC at the clinical cut-off date of 12 
September 2022 median duration of follow-up was 14.9 months (range: 0.5 to 29.0). At this clinical 
cut-off, 64.3% of participants were still in the study and 25.2% were still on talquetamab treatment. 
The primary reason for treatment discontinuation was progressive disease (56.6%). 
In the latest clinical cut-off date of 17 January 2023, among the 106 responders with no prior T cell 
redirection therapy who were assigned to talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC) the median duration of 
follow-up was 18.9 months (range: 2.7 to 32.9 months).  
Among the 145 treated participants (36 in Phase 1 and 109 in Cohort C in Phase 2) without prior T cell 
redirection therapy who were assigned to talquetamab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC  median duration of follow-
up was 8.6 months (range: 0.2 to 22.5). As of the clinical cut-off of 12 September 2022, 49% of 
participants were still on talquetamab treatment and 77.2% of participants were still in the study The 
primary reason for treatment discontinuation was progressive disease (31.7). 
In the latest clinical cut-off date of 17 January 2023, among the 104 responders with no prior T cell 
redirection therapy who were assigned to talquetamab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC the median duration of 
follow-up was 12.9 months (range: 4.1 to 26.1 months). 
Among the 33 responders with prior T cell redirection therapy who were assigned to talquetamab 0.4 
mg/kg weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC and included in the All Treated Analysis set (n=51), the 
median duration of follow-up was 15.3 months (range: 4.9 to 29.0 months) at the latest clinical cut-off 
date of 17 January 2023. 
•  Recruitment 
First subject enrolled: 03 January 2018 
The study is ongoing. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Summary of main protocol amendments 
There were 15 global amendments to the original protocol. The main changes are summarised below: 
Amendment 6 (25 January 2019)  
•  Added details to start evaluation of the SC administration in study parts 1 and 2  
Amendment 11 (23 September 2020)  
•  Added the phase 2 part of the study  
Amendment 13 (17 June 2021)  
•  Added cohort C to evaluate the alternate 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC dosing schedule  
Amendment 15 (07 December 2021) 
• 
Increased the total number of participants for both cohort B and C 
It should be noted that patients with ECOG score of 2 were not allowed for inclusion until amendment 
12 (21 January 2021), which is then reflected in the baseline data and limited results in this subgroup. 
Protocol deviations 
At the first clinical cut-off date of 16 May 2022, protocol deviations occurred for 9.8% of both 
0.4mg/kg weekly and prior T-cell redirections therapy groups and 4.8% for 0.8mg/kg Q2W treated 
patients with no impact on participant safety or data integrity. The most frequent major protocol

participants estimated to be in response at 9 months was 56.6% (95% CI: 37.9%, 71.6%) and at 12 
months was 48.2% (95% CI: 29.4%, 64.7%).  
With a median follow-up of 14.8 months, 17.6% participants (95% CI: 8.4%, 30.9%) achieved MRD 
negativity at 105, and 11.8% (95% CI: 4.4%, 23.9%) achieved MRD negativity at 10-6. Among 18 
participants with CR or better by IRC assessment, 33.3% (95% CI: 13.3%, 59.0%) achieved MRD 
negativity at 10-5. 
The median time to first response (PR or better), best response, VGPR or better, and CR or better was 
1.1, 2.1, 1.5, and 2.8 months, respectively Median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI: 3.4, 13.8) overall.  
At time of updated Cut-off date (17 January 2023), median PFS based on IRC assessment was 5.1 
months (95% CI: 3.4, 12.3) in the All Treated Analysis Set and data are mature. The estimated PFS

•  Ancillary analyses 
In the absence of a direct comparator in Study 64407564MM1001, an adjusted comparative analysis 
using the individual participant data from Study 64407564MMY1001 and from LocoMMotion (initiated in 
2019) and MoMMent (initiated in November 2021), two prospective, observational studies of real-world 
physician's choice (RWPC) of treatment and associated outcomes in triple-class exposed patients with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma has been performed.  
Participants included in the comparative effectiveness analyses from the RWPCs were required to 
satisfy the key inclusion/exclusion criteria for MonumenTAL-1 Phase 2. Propensity-weighting

The primary comparative analyses included all participants who received talquetamab at the 0.4 mg/kg 
weekly SC RP2D in Study 64407564MMY1001 (n=143) and all RWPC patients who met the inclusion 
criteria for Study 64407564MMY1001 (n=165). Additional comparative analyses included all 
participants who received talquetamab at the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC RP2D in Study 64407564MMY1001 
(n=145) and all RWPC patients who met the inclusion criteria for Study 64407564MMY1001 (n=165).

Duration of main phase: 
First subject dosed on 11 January 2018 and 
the study is currently ongoing. 
Study drug to be administered to subjects 
until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or end 
of study (defined as 2 years after the last 
subject has received his or her initial dose of 
talquetamab or when the last subject has 
completed the last study assessment in the 
study, whichever occurs first). 
Hypothesis 
Part 1 & 2 (Phase 1): 
Objectives:  
•  Part 1: To characterise the safety of talquetamab and recommend the 
Phase 2 dose(s) and schedule 
•  Part 2: To further characterise the safety of talquetamab at the 
recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) 
Hypothesis: 
•  Part 1 (dose escalation): One or more candidate RP2D(s) of 
talquetamab can be identified such that <28% of the subjects 
experience a DLT. 
•  Part 2 (dose expansion): talquetamab is safe and demonstrates 
preliminary antitumor activity at the putative RP2D(s).  
Part 3 (Phase 2):  
Objectives:  
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of talquetamab at the RP2D: 
Hypothesis: 
• 
Part 3 (Phase 2): talquetamab has anti-myeloma activity and 
demonstrates efficacy and acceptable safety in 1 or more of the 
following 3 cohorts of subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma with unmet medical need: 
-  Cohort A: Treatment with talquetamab will have significant anti-
myeloma activity (i.e., the lower limit of the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval [CI] for ORR in this cohort will be greater 
than 30%). 
-  Cohort B: Treatment with talquetamab will have meaningful anti-
myeloma activity (i.e., the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI 
for ORR in this cohort will be greater than 15%). 
-  Cohort C: Treatment with talquetamab will have significant anti-
myeloma activity (i.e., the lower limit of the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval [CI] for ORR in this cohort will be greater 
than 30%).

Data Cut) 
Analysis population 
and time point 
description 
A total of 339 participants who received pivotal RP2Ds on or before 20 April 
2022 were included in primary efficacy and safety analyses. Primary efficacy 
data are presented for 143 treated participants with no prior T cell redirection 
therapy and assigned to the 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC RP2D (21 in Phase 1 and 
122 in Cohort A in Phase 2) and 145 treated participants with no prior T cell 
redirection therapy and assigned to the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC (36 in Phase 1 
and 109 in Cohort C in Phase 2).  
In addition, updated data are presented for 51 participants who had received 
prior T cell redirection therapy, and who were assigned to either the 0.4 
mg/kg weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC RP2D (17 in Phase 1 and 34 in Phase 
2 Cohort B). 
Efficacy analyses for the primary and key secondary efficacy analyses in 
these subjects were updated based on a 17 January 2023 clinical cut-off.  The 
updated data provides >8 additional months of follow-up from the initial 
submission (>4 months of follow-up from the efficacy update based on 12 
September 2022 clinical cut-off). The median duration of follow-up was 18.9 
months, 12.9 months, and 15.3 months, for the 0.4 mg/kg weekly, 0.8 
mg/kg Q2W, and Prior T cell Redirection Therapy analysis sets, respectively.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
The basis of evidence for use of talquetamab monotherapy are the results from the pivotal phase 1/2 
Study 64407564MMY1001 (MonumenTAL-1). 
Study MMY1001 was an early, uncontrolled, exploratory trial; in principle, B/R evaluations for 
Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) procedures would require high-quality confirmatory data 
from at least one controlled, randomised trial. However, conditional approvals in advanced settings of 
MM based on promising results from single-arm trials (SAT) are not unprecedented.  
Based on this study, the applicant applied for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation for talquetamab, 
as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, 
who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome 
inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression or did not respond to 
the last therapy. 
Considering the poor prognosis and few alternatives for this triple refractory population, this study 
design could be accepted.  
In this report, efficacy assessment will focus on 2 participant grouping, which correspond to both 
claimed dosing regimens, via SC administration: 
- 
0.4 mg/kg weekly SC RP2D (patients from phase 1 + cohort A in phase 2), with dosing step up 
at initiation to mitigate risks of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
- 
0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC RP2D, (patients from phase 1+ cohort C in phase 2), with dosing step up 
at initiation to mitigate risks of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
The discussion in this report will be focused on these two dose groups, and especially cohorts A and C 
which are representative of the targeted indication. Moreover, the applicant included an explorative 
cohort to study the efficacy of talquetamab in patient with prior T cell redirection therapies (i.e. CAR-T 
or BCMA/CD3 bispecific antibodies); considering the recently approved therapies, despite limited 
conclusions based on exploratory data, this cohort is of interest. Data from this “Prior T Cell 
Redirection Therapy” group (phase 1+ cohort B) will be considered as supportive.  
The primary objective in Part 3 (Phase II) of study MMY-1001 was to evaluate the anti-MM activity of 
talquetamab in terms of ORR using the IMWG response criteria, as assessed by an IRC.  
MM is a chronic malignancy with a progressive clinical course: although ORR can be considered an 
informative endpoint to measure anti MM-activity in advanced disease settings (i.e., when resistance to 
most active compounds is widespread), clinical benefit is better captured by significant gains in time-
to-event endpoints (e.g. PFS, OS). Reliable interpretations of PFS and OS data are, however, 
hampered by the uncontrolled study design. High ORRs, if supported by meaningful data in terms of 
response duration, might still be considered supportive of early access in the claimed high unmet 
medical need setting, provided that no significant uncertainty on internal and external validity is 
present and high internal consistency is observed in the pivotal study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 96/155 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sample size for Phase II Cohort A was determined by assuming that the ORR for talquetamab for 
subjects in Cohort A is at least 45%. With that assumption, the power to declare that the ORR is higher 
than 30% at the one-sided significance level of 0.025 was approximately 90% or greater. 
The sample size for Phase II Cohort B was determined by using 2-stage design to test the null 
hypothesis that the ORR is at most 15%, against the alternative that the ORR is at least 35%. With 
one-sided significance level of 0.025 and a power of 80%, Cohort B needed 34 response-evaluable 
subjects. Assuming a non-evaluable rate of 10%, the total sample size required for Cohort B was 38 
subjects. The sample size will be increased to at least 60 subjects to determine the ORR with more 
precision. 
The sample size for Cohort C was determined by assuming that the observed ORR for talquetamab was 
at least 45%. With that assumption, the power to declare that the ORR was higher than 30% at the 
one-sided significance level of 0.025 was greater than 85%. 
The secondary endpoints in study MMY-1001 are considered, in principle, adequate to further 
characterise the efficacy of talquetamab in the target indication. In particular, given the uncontrolled 
design of the pivotal study, depth and duration of responses are also considered key to support clinical 
benefit evaluation. The importance of an adequate follow-up to characterise both short- and long-term 
efficacy is therefore emphasised, and, from a safety perspective, exposure times should be sufficiently 
long to cover the projected exposure in clinical practice.  
During the phase 1 part of the study, the applicant proceeded a dose escalation to determine the RP2D 
dose regimen; the 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC was first identified. The selected 0.4 mg/kg weekly dose 
regimen was also supported by the available PK/Pd data: at the RP2D the mean talquetamab 
concentrations were constantly at or above the identified EC90 value (although some uncertainty 
remains on the selected EC90 value, see the PK section above). Moreover, T-cell activation markers, 
including pro-inflammatory cytokines, were sub-optimally induced with doses lower than the RP2D. To 
enhance treatment compliance and reduce patient discomfort, the applicant also investigated the 
efficacy of an alternative Q2W administration regimen. However, this suggestion has not been formally 
tested against the lower weekly dose, for example in a non-inferiority setting. Moreover E-R analysis 
did not identify dose schedule (weekly SC vs Q2W SC) as a significant covariate for ORR at the RP2Ds, 
suggesting comparable ORR resulting from either RP2D dose of 0.4 mg/kg weekly or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W. 
Considering the heavily treated targeted population, the search for more convenient dose regimen is 
understood. Higher dose regimens did not increase responses substantially and increased the dose 
reduction frequency. The E-R trend analysis, based on the Phase 1 SC data, suggested that ORR 
increased with talquetamab exposure across SC doses below the RP2Ds, reaching a plateau at or 
above the RP2Ds. It should be noted that during the study, for the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W step-up schedule, 
the third dose was 0.3 mg/kg instead of the proposed 0.4 mg/kg as presented in the SmPC table 1. 
However, it is unlikely that this discrepancy would impact clinical efficacy, thus recommended step-up 
schedule is endorsed. 
Overall, based on the available data, the clinical rationale supporting the proposed dosing schedules for 
MA can be considered acceptable.  
It is noted that study Amendment 9 introduced the possibility to change the dosing frequency of 
talquetamab for participants with CR or prolonged non-CR. Overall, the rationale to allow for switching 
to less frequent administration schedules in responders is understood and considered of possible 
benefit to patients. 
Subjects in Part 3 (Phase 2) Cohorts A and C were requested to have previously received ≥3 prior lines 
of therapy (including at least one PI, one IMiD, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody) with no 
previous exposure to T cell redirection therapies such as CAR-T or bispecific antibodies. Subjects were 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 97/155 
 
 
 
also required to have documented evidence of progressive disease (as per the IMWG 2016 criteria) on 
or within 12 months of their last line of therapy, or to have documented evidence of progressive 
disease within the previous 6 months and to be refractory to their most recent line of therapy. This is 
overall in line with the final indication and acceptable. However, the majority of subjects who received 
talquetamab in study MMY-1001 were indeed refractory to their last line of prior therapy 93.7% and 
94.5% in the 0.4 mg/kg weekly and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W cohort, respectively.  
The CHMP therefore requested that the indication be amended to better reflect refractoriness to the 
last line of therapy from patients that had “…demonstrated disease progression” to “demonstrated 
disease progression on the last therapy”, which was accepted by the applicant. 
Triple-exposed subjects who had also received prior T cell redirection therapy could only be enrolled in 
the dedicated Cohort B, in order to reduce heterogeneity across the overall study population: this is 
acceptable and considered of value to provide further support to the efficacy of talquetamab. 
Overall, the inclusion criteria in study MMY-1001 can be considerate adequate to define a 
heterogeneous, heavily pre-treated population representative of an advanced setting of disease. It is 
noted, however, that patients with severe anaemia (i.e., <8 g/dl), severe renal failure (i.e. GFR <40 
ml/min) and high serum calcium levels (i.e. >14 mg/dl) were excluded from trial participation. Since 
anaemia, renal failure and hypercalcaemia are well known complications of MM, the generalisability of 
results from study MMY-1001 to patients with severe manifestations of MM is limited. Further, it should 
be noted that patients with ECOG score of 2 were not allowed for inclusion until amendment 12 (21 
January 2021), which is then reflected in the baseline data and limited results in this subgroup. 
Protocol deviations occurred for 9.8% of both 0.4mg/kg and prior T-cell redirections therapy groups 
and 4.8% for 0.8mg/kg Q2W treated patients with no impact on participant safety or data integrity. 
After the initial protocol have been issued (12 September 2017) the applicant made several 
amendments to the original study, and this is not unexpected considering the adaptive design and the 
exploratory nature of study MMY-1001. Most changes were not controversial, being aimed at reflecting 
the growing information on the efficacy, safety and clinical pharmacology of talquetamab in the study 
protocol. 
Amendment 9 and Amendment 15 both introduced sample size increases to account for the 
development of the s.c. formulation and to expand the study population in Phase II cohorts B and C. 
Although, in principle, sample size changes in ongoing, open-label studies conducted for regulatory 
purposes are not considered acceptable, in this case it is acknowledged that MMY-1001 was designed 
as an early exploratory study. Although Amendment 15 resulted in an increase of the power of the pre-
specified efficacy analyses in the concerned Phase II cohorts, the clinical and regulatory relevance of 
the efficacy thresholds used in sample size calculations was anyway limited, especially when the high 
response rates observed with the currently available alternatives in advanced MM (e.g., anti-BCMA 
CARTs) are taken into account. Therefore, both amendments are not considered to negatively impact 
on the robustness of the reported results.  
Overall, these changes are acknowledged considering the explorative aspect of the trial. 
Baseline data are detailed for each claimed dose regimen, and for patients with prior T cell redirection 
therapy. The demographics and Baseline characteristics were similar between cohort A (0.4 mg/mg 
QW) and C (0.8 mg/kg Q2W).  
Overall, in cohort A and C respectively most subjects were male (53.3% and 61.5%) with a median 
age of 67 years in both cohorts. Of note, in cohort A, 45.5% of patients were under 65 years, and 
14.7% were 75 years old or higher. Moreover, most of the patient were fit with an ECOG score of ≥2 
for only 10.7% and 7.3% of the patients respectively, as expected per the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
previously discussed. This could question on the reliability of the observed results in the real world use, 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 98/155 
 
 
 
considering the high selection of patients. Considering that the median age at the time of diagnosis for 
MM is 70 years with 37% of patients being younger than 65 years of age, patients in this trial are 
considered younger and fitter than the targeted population, this will be further discussed in comparison 
with real world data provided by the applicant. 
Baseline disease characteristics are also similar between in cohort A and C, patients were around 7 
years from diagnosis (7.43 years and 7.54 years respectively) most of them were ISS stage ≤2, R-ISS 
stage ≤2, and had no extramedullary plasmacytoma (80.3% and 74.3%). Most patients had at least 4 
lytic bone lesions (67.9% in cohort A). To be noted, in cohort A and similarly in cohort C, 53.1% of 
patients had igG MM and 29.4% had light chain MM, which is in line with real world data. Considering 
prior therapies, 100% of both cohorts patients were triple exposed (PI+IMiD+anti-CD38), as per the 
inclusion criteria in the protocol, and a majority were penta-exposed (72.1% and 70.6%) and stem cell 
transplanted (77.9% and 78.9%). Radiotherapy was used on almost half this population (45.1% and 
44%). Considering refractory status, 100% of patients were refractory at any point to prior therapy, 
and a majority of patient were triple refractory (74.6% and 68.8%). Of note, in cohort A, 93.7% of 
patients were refractory to their last treatment. These data confirm that these relatively young and fit 
patients were still heavily pre-treated and thus represent the targeted indication. 
Of note, demographics and baseline characteristics in the prior T cell redirection therapy subgroup 
(Cohort B) differ from the other two groups in terms of age (64.7% < 65 years, no patient >80 years) 
but race, ethnicity, sex ratio and baseline disease are globally in line. Moreover, 64.7% of these 
patients received more than 5 prior therapies (vs 33.2% and 42.2%), which is expected in this prior T 
cell redirection therapy subgroup. To be noted, this subgroup of patients has a limited sample size 
(n=51). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results from phase 2 alone, and pooled with phase 1, are discussed below. Of note, taking into 
account the longer exposure in phase 1 group, and different dose, pooled data could be slightly biased 
and different from the target population, better represented by phase 2 data. However, pooled data 
help providing a larger population. 
Study 64407564MMY1001 met its pre specified primary endpoint (30% for Cohorts A and C and 15% 
for cohort B) demonstrating a clinically significant improvement in Overall Response Rate (ORR). 
At the latest DCO date (17 January 2023), the median follow-up was 18.8 months of median FU in the 
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC All Treated Analysis Set and 12.7 months in the RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
all treated analysis set. ORR was consistent with 74.1% (95% CI: 66.1% to 81.1%) and 71.7% (95% 
CI: 63.7% to 78.9%) respectively. CR or better was 33.6% (CI95%:25.9%, 41.9%) and 38.6% 
(CI95%:30.7%, 47.1%), in the two dosing regimens respectively. 
Median DOR for participants assigned to talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC was 9.5 months (95% CI: 
6.7 to 13.3). Median DOR for participants assigned to talquetamab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC remains not 
reached, and 88.6% of responders had at least 9 months of follow-up; the percentage of participants 
estimated to be in response at 9 months was 76.3% (95% CI: 66.5%, 83.7%) and at 12 months was 
69.3% (95% CI: 57.8%, 78.2%) which is promising. 
Median PFS was 7.5 months 95% CI95%: 5.7, 9.4) for the RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC analysis set but 
remains immature for the RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC analysis set. Nevertheless, with a median of 12.7 
months FU, the estimated 12-month PFS is 54.4% (CI95%: 45.3, 62.6) this is still promising 
considering the poor prognosis in this heavily pre-treated population. Median OS is still not reached, 
and OS data are still immature. However, the 12-month overall survival rate (95% CI) was 76.4% 
(68.3, 82.7) for RP2D 0.4 mg/kg QW SC analysis set and 77.4% (69.1, 83.7) for the RP2D 0.8 mg/kg 
Q2W SC analysis set, which is promising.

MRD results are comparable between RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC and RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC, with 
30.8% participants (95% CI: 23.3%, 39.0%) and 29.7% participants (95% CI: 22.4%, 37.8%) who 
achieved MRD negativity at 10-5 and 21% (CI95%14.6;28.6) and 20.7% (CI95%: 14.4; 28.2) who 
achieved MRD negativity at 10-6 respectively. 
The median time to first response (PR or better), best response, VGPR or better, and CR or better was 
1.2, 2.2, 1.9, and 2.6 months in the RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC group and 1.3, 3.0, 2.2, and 4.7 
months, respectively in the RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC. Most participants demonstrated their first 
response rapidly, by the start of Cycle 2. 
ORR and median DOR for participants with prior T cell redirection therapy who were assigned to 
talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC were 64.7% (95% CI:50.1% to 77.6%) and 
11.9 months (95% CI: 4.8 to Not Estimable) respectively. Median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI: 3.4, 
13.8) overall and the 9month PFS rate was 40.9% (95% CI: 26.9%, 54.4%). The estimated OS rate at 
6 months was 81.1% (95% CI: 66.8%, 89.7%) overall, and the estimated OS rate at 12 months was 
59.6% (95% CI: 41.7%, 73.7%) overall, which in this subgroup with highest unmet medical need is 
promising. However, PFS and OS data are still immature. 17.6% participants (95% CI: 8.4%, 30.9%) 
achieved MRD negativity at 10-5, and 11.8% (95% CI: 4.4%, 23.9%) achieved MRD negativity at 10-6.  
The available data from pivotal study MMY-1001 showed that treatment with talquetamab, in a heavily 
pre-treated population of patients with RR MM, resulted in high ORRs with a relevant proportion of 
deeper responses, in line with what observed in similar settings with other T-cell redirection therapies. 
Uncertainties remain, however, on the generalisability of the results to the targeted population 
identified by the claimed indication, since less pre-treated patients (e.g. with 2 prior lines of therapy) 
who received talquetamab in Phase I were included in the pooled efficacy analysis. Furthermore, 
elderly and frailer patients, that represent a significant fraction of the MM population, might have been 
under-represented in study MMY-1001.  
Overall, despite the significant uncertainties related to the limited sample size, the available data in 
subjects who had received prior anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapies and bispecific monoclonal antibodies 
suggested that deep and durable responses can still be obtained with talquetamab. This is of relevance 
in the context of major therapeutic advantage demonstration when the current treatment options in 
the claimed indication are considered. In particular, the limited available data can be considered 
supportive of the possibility of talquetamab to overcome resistance to anti-BCMA T cell engager 
therapies, at least in a subset of patients.  
Comparison of Study 64407564MMY1001 Efficacy Data Using Real World Evidence 
To contextualise the efficacy results, namely time to event endpoints, the applicant provided data from 
two prospective, non-interventional studies (LocoMMotion and MoMMent) in triple-exposed patients 
treated with real-world (RW) treatment options. Both dosing regimens were compared to the RW data 
after applying MonumenTAL-1 eligibility criteria, propensity-weighted adjustment and estimating the 
average treatment effect in the treated population to minimise bias.  However, the intrinsic limitations 
in such matched indirect comparisons are significant especially in the context of disease settings 
characterised by significant clinical, biological, and treatment-related heterogeneity. Overall, the 
regulatory relevance of the provided indirect comparisons is considered limited. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
To confirm the positive benefit-risk profile that is expected to be established in the still ongoing 
MonumenTAL-1, the applicant has initiated a confirmatory phase 3 study.  
Study 64407564MMY3002 is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase 3 study to determine 
whether talquetamab in combination with daratumumab and pomalidomide (Tal- DP; Arm A) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 100/155 
 
 
 
talquetamab in combination with daratumumab (Tal-D; Arm C) have better efficacy respectively than 
the combination of daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd; Arm B) in participants with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have previously received at least 1 prior line of therapy. 
Approximately 810 patients will be randomised in a 1.1.1 ratio to Tal-DP, Tal-D and DPd. 
The proposed confirmatory study is for a different patient population with RRMM in second line and in 
association, this could be acceptable from an efficacy point of view. Feasibility of this confirmatory 
study is likely given the different patient population. An interim report from this study is planned for 
Q2 2027 and the final report in Q2 2030. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy data submitted in this MAA support the benefit of talquetamab in the final agreed 
indication. The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data 
in the context of a conditional MA:  
• Final study report from study 64407564MMY3002 a phase 3 randomised study investigating the 
efficacy of talquetamab in combination with sc. daratumumab and pomalidomide (Tal-DP) or 
talquetamab in combination with daratumumab sc (Tal-D) vs. daratumumab sc, pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone (DPd), in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received 
at least 1 prior line of therapy should be provided. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The safety data for Study 64407564MMY1001 are summarised by RP2D dose and prior exposure to T 
cell redirection therapies such as CAR-T or bispecific antibodies, as well as for the total treated 
population: 
-RP2D 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC (n=143): All treated participants assigned to 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC either 
in Phase 1 (n=21) or Phase 2 Cohort A (n=122), who had not been exposed to T cell redirection 
therapies. 
-RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC (n=145): All treated participants assigned to 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC either in 
Phase 1 (n=36) or Phase 2 of Cohort C (n=109), who had not been exposed to T cell redirection 
therapies. 
-Prior T cell redirection therapies exposure at RP2Ds (n=51): All treated participants assigned to 0.4 
mg/kg weekly SC (either in Phase 1 [n=9] or Phase 2 Cohort B [n=34]) or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC (Phase 
1 [n=8]), who had been exposed to T cell redirection therapies. 
-All treated participants (N=501): All treated participants assigned to any dose cohort, including SC 
dose regimens lower and higher than the RP2Ds and IV dose regimens, and regardless of prior 
therapies. 
The first clinical cut-off date used for the analysis of safety was 16 May 2022, based on the protocol-
specified primary analysis, which was to be conducted approximately 9 months after the 120th 
participant in Cohort A received his or her initial dose of talquetamab. An updated analysis was 
provided during the evaluation of the product with a cut-off date of 17th January 2023. Results 
presented here are for the latest cut-off data unless otherwise specified.

TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event; IV = intravenous, SC = subcutaneous, RP2D=recommended Phase 2 
dose; RS=cytokine release syndrome; ICANS= immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity. 
Note: RP2D includes Phase 1 RP2D treatment groups, Phase 2 Cohort A and Phase 2 Cohort C. 
Note: The output includes the diagnosis of CRS and ICANS; the symptoms of CRS or ICANS are excluded. 
Note: Adverse events are reported until 100 days (Phase 1) or 30 days (Phase 2) after the last dose of talquetamab 
or until the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, if earlier. 
Note: Percentages calculated with the number of subjects in the All Treated Analysis Set as denominator. 
Note: Adverse events are graded according to the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.03, with the exception of ICANS and CRS. 
CRS was originally graded by Lee criteria (Lee et al 2014) in Phase 1 and by ASTCT consensus grading system (Lee 
et al 2019) in Phase 2, with conversion of grade in Phase 1 RP2D to ASTCT based on data in eCRF. Toxicity grade 
for CRS by ASTCT is presented in this table, for both Phase 1 RP2D and Phase 2. For IV and SC Non-RP2D CRS 
toxicity grading is presented based on Lee criteria. Toxicity grade for ICANS by ASTCT is also presented in this 
table.

Key: RP2D=recommended Phase 2 dose, SC= Subcutaneous, IV= Intravenous; TEAE = treatment-emergent 
adverse event; CRS = cytokine release syndrome. 
Note: RP2D includes Phase 1 RP2D treatment groups, Phase 2 Cohort A and Phase 2 Cohort C. 
Note: IV includes all IV treatment groups; Non-RP2D(<RP2D) includes 5 ug/kg weekly, 15 ug/kg weekly, 45 ug/kg 
weekly and 135 ug/kg weekly treatment groups; Non-RP2D(>RP2D) includes 800 ug/kg weekly, 1200 ug/kg bi-
weekly and 1600 ug/kg monthly treatment groups; Prior T cell exposures at RP2Ds includes Phase 1 RP2D 400 
ug/kg weekly with prior CART or prior bispecific, Phase 1 RP2D 800 ug/kg biweekly with prior CART or prior 
bispecific and Phase 2 Cohort B treatment groups. 
Note: Subjects are counted only once for any given event, regardless of the number of times they actually 
experienced the event. Adverse events are coded using MedDRA Version 25.0. 
Note: Percentages calculated with the number of subjects in the All Treated Analysis Set as denominator. 
Note: The output includes the diagnosis of CRS and ICANS; the symptoms of CRS or ICANS are excluded. 
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events related to talquetamab 
The common related TEAE of asthenia occurred at a ≥10% higher frequency in treated participants 
assigned to 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC (21.7%) than 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC (6.2%). The common related TEAE 
of dry mouth occurred at a ≥10% higher frequency in treated participants assigned to 0.8 mg/kg Q2W 
SC (37.9%) than 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC (21.7%). Although interpretation is limited due to a small 
sample size (n=51), participants with prior T cell redirection therapies exposure appeared to have 
relatively higher incidences for several common related TEAEs such as dysgeusia, dry mouth, skin and 
soft tissue disorders (including pruritis), fatigue, and cytopenia events (including neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia).

RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
The most frequently reported related TEAEs by preferred term (≥20% of participants) were CRS 
(79.0%), dysgeusia (48.3%), weight decreased (38.5%), neutropenia (28.7%), skin exfoliation (28%), 
pyrexia (27.3%), anaemia (25.2%), lymphopenia (21.7%), dry mouth (21.7%), asthenia (21.7%), 
dysphagia (21.0%). nail disorder (21%) and dry skin (20.3%). 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
The most frequently reported related TEAEs by preferred term (≥20% of participants) were CRS 
(74.5%), dysgeusia (48.3%), skin exfoliation (38.6%), dry mouth (37.9%), weight decreased 
(35.9%), dry skin (31.7%), anaemia (24.8%), lymphopenia (24.1%), decreased appetite (24.1%), 
dysphagia (22.8 %), fatigue (22.1%), neutropenia (20.7%), nail disorder (20.7%) and ageusia (20%).  
Participants with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
The most frequently reported related TEAEs by preferred term (≥20% of participants) were CRS 
(76.5%), dysgeusia (60.8%), dry mouth (47.1%), neutropenia (45.1%), skin exfoliation (39.2%), 
fatigue (27.5%), dry skin (31.4%), thrombocytopenia (29.4%), nail disorder (25.5%), weight 
decreased (25.5%), pruritis (25.5%), anaemia (29.7%), leukopenia (23.5%), and dysphagia (21.6%), 
lymphopenia (28.3%), neutropenia (20.7%) 
All Treated Participants 
Investigators considered at least 1 TEAE to be related to study treatment for 97.6% of all treated 
participants. Higher incidences for several TEAEs were generally observed at doses higher than RP2Ds 
than those at RP2Ds or doses lower than non- RP2Ds, including CRS (84.2%), dysgeusia (76.3%), dry 
mouth (47.4%), lymphopenia (39.5%), and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders such as skin 
exfoliation (47.4%) and nail disorder (31.6%). 
Adverse drug reactions 
The ADR analysis of TEAEs was conducted in a stepwise manner:  
• 
Preferred terms representing the same clinical entity (e.g., neutropenia and low neutrophil counts) 
or closely related events (e.g., tachycardia and sinus tachycardia) were grouped to thoroughly 
evaluate the true incidence rate of these medical concepts. Grouped terms proposed by the 
sponsor were added per clinical judgment.  
• 
Inclusion as an ADR of those AEs with an incidence rate of ≥10% (commonly reported) of 
participants treated with talquetamab and meeting at least 1 specified criterion for ADR 
classification (ie, evidence of dose response, medical importance, biologic plausibility, class effect, 
and typical safety concerns such as organ toxicity).  
• 
Inclusion as an ADR of those AEs with an incidence rate <10% meeting at least 1 specified 
criterion for ADR classification: 
− 
− 
− 
Reported as serious in ≥2% of participants  
Clinically relevant and medically important 
Biologic plausibility. 
• 
Laboratory abnormalities worsening from the baseline in ≥30% of participants following treatment 
with talquetamab. 
Based on the above, the applicant’s proposed list of ADRs is summarised in Table 43.

Investigations 
Key: RP2D = recommended phase 2 dose, CRS = cytokine release syndrome, ICANS = immune effector cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome 
RP2D includes Phase 1 RP2D treatment group and Phase 2 cohorts A, B and C. 
Note: Adverse events are reported until 100 days (Phase 1) or 30 days (Phase 2) after the last dose of talquetamab or until 
the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, if earlier. 
Note: Adverse events are graded according to the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.03, with the exception of ICANS and CRS. CRS was 
originally graded by Lee criteria (Lee et al 2014) in Phase 1 and by ASTCT consensus grading system (Lee et al 2019) in 
Phase 2, with conversion of grade in Phase 1 to ASTCT based on data in eCRF. Toxicity grade for CRS by ASTCT is presented 
in this table, for both Phase 1 and Phase 2. Toxicity grade for ICANS by ASTCT is also presented in this table. 
Note: Subjects are counted only once for any given event, regardless of the number of times they actually experienced the 
event. Adverse events are coded using MedDRA Version 24.1. 
Note: The output includes the diagnosis of CRS and ICANS; the symptoms of CRS or ICANS are excluded. 
Note: ICANs were only collected for phase 2. Denominators are based on number of subjects in Phase 2: 156 in the 400 
ug/kg weekly group and 109 in the 800 ug/kg Bi-weekly group. 
 Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); 
very rare (<1/10,000).

Grade 5 Treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
Grade 5 TEAEs within 30 days of the last dose of talquetamab were reported for 5 participants (3.5%), 
none of which were judged by the investigator to be related to talquetamab: 
• 
In 1 participant (0.7%) with a Grade 5 TEAE (general physical health deterioration), the 
investigator reported progressive disease was the primary cause of death.  
• 
In the other 4 participants (2.8%), the following Grade 5 TEAEs were reported (one each): 
COVID 19 pneumonia, septic shock achieved, pulmonary embolism, fungal sepsis 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
Grade 5 TEAEs within 30 days of the last dose of talquetamab were reported for 6 participants (4.1%), 
none of which were judged by the investigator to be related to talquetamab: 
• 
In 2 participants (1.4%) with a Grade 5 TEAE, the investigator reported progressive disease 
was the primary cause of death. 
• 
In the other 4 participants (2.8%), the following Grade 5 TEAEs were reported (one each): 
basilar artery occlusion, acute respiratory failure, infection and COVID 19 pneumonia.  
Participants with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
Grade 5 TEAE were not reported for any participant. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Based on the mechanism of action of talquetamab, specifically the activation of T cells, Cytokine 
Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity events were anticipated events in this study. Multiple 
myeloma as a disease state is associated with cytopenias, hypogammaglobulinaemia, and an increased 
risk of infection. Other adverse events of clinical interest related to administration of talquetamab 
include sARRs, injection-site reactions, skin and nail toxicities, and oral toxicities. 
Cytokine release syndrome 
CRS was graded per American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria in 
Phase 2 of Study 64407564MMY1001 and per Lee 2014 grading criteria in Phase 1. Grading of events 
in Phase 1 was converted during analysis to ASTCT criteria for participants treated at RP2Ds. 
Symptoms of CRS are presented as such, and not as separate TEAEs, to avoid duplication of events.  
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
At least 1 event of CRS (any grade) was reported for 113 participants (79.0%). Using ASTCT grading, 
the maximum severity of CRS was Grade 1 (62.2%), Grade 2 (14.7%), or Grade 3 (2.1%). No 
participant discontinued treatment due to CRS. No additional participants since the initial submission 
experienced a serious TEAE of CRS.  
Per ASTCT criteria, all participants with CRS had at least a symptom of pyrexia. Other symptoms that 
occurred in ≥5% of participants were hypotension (13.3%), chills (9.1%), and hypoxia (7.7%). As 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 114/155 
 
 
 
 
 
reported in the initial submission, the maximum severity of most symptoms of CRS was Grade 1 or 2. 
Grade 3 symptoms of CRS were pyrexia (6.3%) and hypotension (2.8%); no Grade 4 or 5 symptoms 
were reported.  
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
At least 1 event of CRS (any grade) was reported for 108 participants (74.5%). Using ASTCT grading, 
the maximum severity of CRS was Grade 1 (57.2%), Grade 2 (16.6%), or Grade 3 (0.7%).  
Per ASTCT criteria, all but 1 participant with CRS had at least a symptom of pyrexia. Other symptoms 
of CRS that occurred in ≥5% of participants were hypotension (13.8%), chills (13.8%), hypoxia 
(6.2%), headache (5.5%), and tachycardia (5.5%). The maximum severity of most symptoms of CRS 
was Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 symptoms of CRS included pyrexia (1.4%), and alanine aminotransferase 
increased, coagulopathy, dyspnoea, hepatitis, hypotension, hypoxia, and sinus tachycardia (1 
participant each; 0.7%), One participant (0.7%) had Grade 4 aspartate aminotransferase increased, 
and 1 participant had Grade 4 hypotension. No Grade 5 symptoms of CRS were reported 
Participants with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
At least 1 event of CRS (any grade) was reported for 39 participants (76.5%). Using ASTCT grading, 
the maximum severity of CRS was Grade 1 (52.9%), Grade 2 (21.6%), or Grade 3 (2.0%). No 
participant discontinued treatment due to CRS. 
Per ASTCT criteria, all but 1 participant with CRS had at least a symptom of pyrexia. Other symptoms 
of CRS that occurred in ≥5% of participants were hypotension (21.6%), chills (17.6%), tachycardia 
(9.8%), and hypoxia (7.8%). The maximum severity of most symptoms of CRS was Grade 1 or 2, and 
no Grade 4 or 5 symptoms were reported. 
Neurologic adverse events and neurotoxicity 
Neurologic adverse events 
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
At least 1 TEAE in the Nervous System Disorders SOC or Psychiatric Disorders SOC was reported for 
86.0% of participants. The most commonly reported preferred terms were oral toxicities such as 
dysgeusia (48.3%), ageusia (19.6%), or taste disorder (7.0%); see Section 2.1.6.8 for a discussion of 
oral toxicity. Other commonly reported preferred terms (≥5%) for neurologic TEAEs were headache 
(18.2%), ICANS (10.7%), insomnia (7.0%), and dizziness (5.6%). Incidences for grouped terms were 
encephalopathy (9.8%), sensory neuropathy (8.4%), and motor dysfunction (3.5%). Grade 3 
neurologic TEAEs were reported for 4.9% of participants; ICANS (1.6%) was the only Grade 3 
neurologic TEAE reported for more than 1 participant. No Grade 4 or 5 neurologic TEAEs were 
reported. Serious neurologic TEAEs were ICANS (4.1%), encephalopathy (1.4%), and lethargy, spinal 
cord compression, and syncope. 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
At least 1 TEAE in the Nervous System Disorders SOC or Psychiatric Disorders SOC was reported for 
80.7% of participants. The most commonly reported preferred terms were oral toxicities such as 
dysgeusia (46.2%), ageusia (18.6%), or taste disorder (4.1%). Other commonly reported preferred 
terms (≥5%) for neurologic TEAEs were headache (18.6%), ICANS (10.1%), and dizziness (7.6%).

Neurotoxicity 
Neurotoxicity included all reported TEAEs in the Nervous System Disorders SOC or Psychiatric 
Disorders SOC (excluding oral toxicities: dysgeusia, ageusia, hypogeusia, and taste disorder) that were 
judged by the investigator to be related to talquetamab. Although ICANS is discussed separately in this 
Section, these events are also included in the discussion of neurotoxicity events. 
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
Neurotoxicity events were reported for 44 participants (30.8%). The most commonly reported 
preferred terms (≥5%) were ICANS (10.7%) and headache (9.1%). Grade 3 neurotoxicity events were 
reported for 2 participants (1.4%; both participants had Grade 3 ICANS). No Grade 4 or 5 
neurotoxicity events were reported (one fatal ICANS event occurred at the investigational site in China 
that was outside of the scope of the MAA analyses). Serious neurotoxicity events were reported for 6 
participants (4.2%), and included ICANS (4.1%) and encephalopathy (0.7%). Of the neurotoxicity 
events reported, 34.6% occurred concurrently with CRS (the neurotoxicity event occurred during or 
within 7 days after the end date of CRS). 
At the latest clinical cut-off, 74.4% of neurotoxicity events had resolved, with a median duration of 4 
days (range: 1 to 618). Two participants (1.4%) discontinued treatment due to a neurotoxicity event, 
both due to ICANS. 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
Neurotoxicity events were reported for 43 participants (29.7%). The most commonly reported 
preferred terms for neurotoxicity events (≥5%) were ICANS (10.1%), headache (9.0%), and dizziness

with ICANS and 1 participant each with dizziness, headache, insomnia, or nystagmus. Grade 4 
neurotoxicity was reported for 1 participant (ICANS). No Grade 5 neurotoxicity events were reported. 
Serious neurotoxicity events were reported for 7 participants (4.8%), and included ICANS (3.7%), and 
ataxia, dizziness, and nystagmus (each 0.7%). Of the neurotoxicity events reported, 28.4% occurred 
concurrently with CRS (the neurotoxicity event occurred during or within 7 days after the end date of 
CRS). 
At the latest clinical cut-off, 62.2% of the neurotoxicity events had resolved, with a median duration of 
5 days (range: 1 to 321). Two participants (1.4%) discontinued treatment due to a neurotoxicity 
event, 1 due to ICANS and 1 due to ataxia.

Participants Assigned to RP2Ds with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
Neurotoxicity events were reported for 11 participants (21.6%). The most commonly reported 
preferred term (≥5%) was headache (9.8%). No Grade ≥3 neurotoxicity event was reported. A serious 
neurotoxicity event of ICANS was reported for 1 participant. Of the neurotoxicity events reported, 
40.0% occurred concurrently with CRS (the neurotoxicity event occurred during or within 7 days after 
CRS). 
At the latest clinical cut-off, 66.7% of neurotoxicity events had resolved, with a median duration of 2.5 
days (range: 1 to 24). No participant discontinued treatment due to a neurotoxicity event  
ICANS 
As Phase 1 for Study 64407564MMY1001 started before the ASTCT consensus criteria for ICANS were 
implemented, ICANS could not be identified or excluded for participants in Phase 1. Therefore, the 
incidence and summary of ICANS reported in this section is limited to participants assigned to RP2Ds 
who were enrolled in Phase 2 of the study (Cohorts A, C, and B).  
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
In Cohort A (n=122), ICANS was reported for 13 participants (10.7%). Grade 3 ICANS was reported 
for 1.6% of participants; no Grade 4 or 5 ICANS was reported. A serious TEAE of ICANS was reported 
for 4.1% of participants. Fourteen of 21 ICANS events (66.7%) started concurrently with CRS (during 
or within 7 days of resolution of CRS).  
At the latest clinical cut-off, 85.7% of the ICANS events had resolved. Two participants had unresolved 
ICANS events (both nonserious Grade 2 events), both of whom died while ICANS was ongoing (1 from 
multiple organ failure and 1 from progressive disease. 2 participants (1.6%) discontinued treatment 
due to ICANS (1 with Grade 2 ICANS and 1 with Grade 3 ICANS). 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
In Cohort C (n=109), ICANS was reported for 12 participants (11.0%). Grade 3 ICANS was reported 
for 2.8% of participants. Grade 4 ICANS was reported for 1 participant (0.9%). No Grade 5 ICANS was 
reported. A serious TEAE of ICANS was reported for 3.7% of participants. Ten of 15 ICANS events 
(66.7%) started concurrently with CRS (during or within 7 days of resolution of CRS).  
At the latest clinical cut-off, 80.0% of the ICANS events had resolved, including all Grade 3 events. 
Two participants had unresolved ICANS events at the updated clinical cut-off, including the participant 
with Grade 4 ICANS and a participant with a serious Grade 2 event, both of whom died due to 
progressive disease while ICANS was ongoing. 1 participant discontinued treatment due to ICANS. 
Participants Assigned to RP2Ds with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
In Cohort B (n=34), an ICANS event was reported for 1 participant (2.9%) and was concurrent with a 
CRS event. This was reported as a serious Grade 1 event. No participants discontinued treatment due 
to ICANS. 
Systemic Administration-related Reactions 
The frequencies of Systemic Administration-related Reactions (sARRs) in RP2D and other SC doses 
were low and similar. The switch from IV dosing to SC dosing in dose escalation substantially reduced 
the incidence of sARRs: at least 1 sARRs event was reported for 19.6% of participants in the IV 
cohorts). 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 117/155 
 
 
 
 
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
sARRs events were reported for 3.5% of participants. Pyrexia (2.1%) was the only sARRs event that 
was reported for more than 1 participant. The median time to onset of sARRs events was 3 days 
(range: 1 to 4) from the last injection, with a median duration of 3 days (range: 1 to 4). 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
sARRs events were reported for 2.8% of participants. No sARRs event was reported for more than 1 
participant. The median time to onset of sARRs events was 2.0 days (range: 1 to 4) from the last 
injection, with a median duration of 2.5 days (range: 1 to 6). 
Participants Assigned to RP2Ds with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
sARRs events were reported for 7.8% of participants. Pyrexia (3.9%) and rash (3.9%) were reported 
for more than 1 participant each. The median time to onset of sARRs events was 1.0 days (range: 1 to 
2), with a median duration of 2.0 days (range: 1 to 9).  
Injection-site Reactions 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) reported in treated participants assigned to RP2Ds had a maximum 
severity of Grade 1 or Grade 2.  
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
ISR events were reported for 13.3% of participants. Injection site erythema (9.1%) and injection site 
rash (2.8%) were reported for ≥2% of participants. The median time to onset of ISR events was 2 
days (range: 1 to 9) from the last injection, with a median duration of 9.5 days (range: 1 to 155).  
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
ISR events were reported for 9.7% of participants. Injection site erythema (5.5%) and injection site 
reaction (2.1%) were reported for ≥2% of participants. The median time to onset of ISR events was 1 
day (range: 1 to 4), with a median duration of 6 days (range: 2 to 50). 
Participants Assigned to RP2Ds with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
ISR events were reported for 21.6% of participants. Injection site erythema (7.8%), injection site rash 
(5.9%), and injection site pruritus (3.9%) were reported for more than 1 participant. The median time 
to onset of ISR events was of 2 days (range: 1 to 4), with a median duration of 6.5 days (range: 1 to 
43). 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia 
Multiple myeloma as a disease state is associated with hypogammaglobulinaemia (Lancman 2021). The 
incidence of hypogammaglobulinaemia was assessed based on both AE reporting by investigators (ie, 
the grouped term hypogammaglobulinaemia, which included the preferred terms 
hypogammaglobulinaemia, blood immunoglobulin G decreased, and hypoglobulinaemia), as well as by 
clinical laboratory data (hypogammaglobulinaemia defined as a postbaseline IgG value <500 mg/dL).  
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
Postbaseline IgG values consistent with hypogammaglobulinaemia were reported for 64.3% of 
participants. A TEAE in the grouped term for hypogammaglobulinaemia was reported for 4 participants 
(2.8%); the maximum severity of these events was Grade 2. One Grade 1 TEAE of 
hypogammaglobulinaemia was judged by the investigator as related to talquetamab, and no event of 
hypogammaglobulinaemia was a serious TEAE. No participant changed dosing or discontinued study

drug due to hypogammaglobulinaemia. Immunoglobulin treatment was administered at any time 
(before or after receiving talquetamab) in 13.3% of participants. 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
Postbaseline IgG values consistent with hypogammaglobulinaemia were reported for 60.7% of 
participants. A TEAE in the grouped term for hypogammaglobulinaemia was reported for 3.4% of 
participants; the maximum severity of these events was Grade 2. Investigators considered these 
events to be related to talquetamab treatment but no event of hypogammaglobulinaemia was a serious 
TEAE. No participant discontinued study drug due to hypogammaglobulinaemia and the dose was 
reduced for 1 participant. Immunoglobulin treatment was administered at any time (before or after 
receiving talquetamab) in 9.7% of participants. 
Participants Assigned to RP2Ds with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
Postbaseline IgG values consistent with hypogammaglobulinaemia were reported for 66.7% of 
participants. A TEAE in the grouped term for hypogammaglobulinaemia was reported for 1 participant. 
The event was judged by the investigator as Grade 1 in severity and related to talquetamab and was 
not a serious TEAE. The participant did not change dosing or discontinue study drug due to 
hypogammaglobulinaemia. Immunoglobulin treatment was administered at any time (before or after 
receiving talquetamab) in 9.8% of participants.

Infection 
Serious infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have been reported in participants 
treated with talquetamab.  
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
At least 1 TEAE of infection (any grade) was reported for 84 participants (58.7%), The most frequently 
reported infections (≥5%) were upper respiratory tract infection (12.6%), COVID-19 (10.5%), urinary 
tract infection (9.8%), nasopharyngitis (9.8%), pneumonia (7.7%), and bronchitis (8.4%). 
The maximum severity of infections was Grade 3 or 4 for 19.6% of participants. The following Grade 3 
or 4 infections were reported in more than 1 participant each: pneumonia (3.5%), urinary tract 
infection (2.1%), and COVID-19 and sepsis (each 1.4%), 3 participants (2.1%) had a Grade 5 
infection, including 1 participant each with COVID-19 pneumonia, fungal sepsis, and septic shock. 
Infections were reported as serious TEAEs in 27 participants (18.9%). One participant (0.7%) each 
discontinued study treatment due to fungal sepsis or pneumonia, reflecting no change since the initial 
submission. 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
At least 1 TEAE of infection (any grade) was reported for 96 participants (66.2%). The most frequently 
reported infections (≥5%) were COVID-19 (23.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (9.0%), 
nasopharyngitis (6.9%), and pneumonia (6.2%).  
The maximum severity of infections was Grade 3 or 4 for 15.9% of participants. The following Grade 3 
or 4 infections were each reported in more than 1 participant: COVID-19 and pneumonia (each 2.1%), 
and cellulitis (1.4%). 2 participants (1.4%) had a Grade 5 infection, including 1 participant each with 
COVID-19 pneumonia and “infection” (unknown aetiology). Each of these participants had the same 
preferred term reported as a Grade 3 or 4 event before the Grade 5 event, and neither event was 
considered related to study drug. Infections were reported as serious TEAEs in 23 participants 
(15.9%). No participant discontinued study treatment due to an infection. 
Participants Assigned to RP2Ds with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
At least 1 TEAE of infection (any grade) was reported for 37 participants (72.5%). The most frequently 
reported infections (≥5%) were upper respiratory tract infection (17.6%), COVID-19 and urinary tract 
infection (each 11.8%), rhinovirus infection (7.8%), and pneumonia and respiratory tract infection 
(each 5.9%). 
The maximum severity of infections was Grade 3 or 4 for 27.5% of participants. The following Grade 3 
or 4 infections were each reported in more than 1 participant: pneumonia (5.9%), and urinary tract

infection and Escherichia urinary tract infection (each 3.9%). No participant had a Grade 5 infection. 
Infections were reported as serious TEAEs in 10 participants (19.6%). 1 participant discontinued study 
treatment due to an infection (rash pustular). 
COVID-19 
COVID-19 as a grouped term was reported with a higher incidence in participants assigned to 0.8 
mg/kg Q2W SC than 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and participants assigned to RP2Ds with prior T cell 
redirection therapies (26.2% vs 11.2% and 13.7%, respectively). This may in part be explained by the 
circulation of more infectious COVID-19 variants (Omicron) at the time that greater numbers of 
participants were receiving study treatment in the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC cohort than the 0.4 mg/kg 
weekly SC cohort. 
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
As a grouped term, COVID-19 was reported for 16 participants (11.2%). The maximum severity of 
COVID-19 was Grade 3 for 2 participants and Grade 5 (fatal) for 1 participant. COVID-19 led to 
skipped doses in 5.6% of participants. No participant discontinued study drug due to COVID-19. 
Vaccination for COVID-19 was reported for 59.4% of participants. 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
COVID-19 was reported for 38 participants (26.2%). The maximum severity of COVID-19 was Grade 3 
for 2.8% and Grade 5 (fatal) for 0.7% (1 participant). COVID-19 led to skipped doses in 8.3% of 
participants. No participant discontinued study drug due to COVID-19. Vaccination for COVID-19 was 
reported for 62.8% of participants. 
Participants Assigned to RP2Ds with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
COVID-19 was reported for 7 participants (13.7%). The maximum severity of COVID-19 was Grade 3 
for 3.9% and Grade 4 or 5 for no participant. COVID-19 led to skipped doses in 5.9% of participants. 
No participant discontinued study drug due to COVID-19. Vaccination for COVID-19 was reported for 
41.2% of participants.  
Opportunistic infections 
Opportunistic infections, i.e., those that occur more often or more severely in the setting of 
immunosuppression, were evaluated as a grouped term.  
RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
Opportunistic infections were reported for 5 participants (3.5%). First onset occurred during step-up 
dosing or the first 4 treatment cycles. As reported in the initial submission, 1 opportunistic infection 
(fungal sepsis) led to treatment discontinuation and was fatal.  
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
Opportunistic infections were reported for 8 participants (5.5%). First onset to opportunistic infections 
usually occurred during the first 4 treatment cycles or during later treatment cycles. No opportunistic 
infection led to treatment discontinuation or was fatal. 
Participants Assigned to RP2Ds with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
Opportunistic infections were reported for 3 participants (5.9%). No opportunistic infection led to 
treatment discontinuation or was fatal.

concurrently with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Among 31 participants with a Grade 3 or 4 infection during 
the study, 4 (12.9%) had the infection concurrently with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC 
Among 96 participants with an infection (any grade) during the study, 3 (3.1%) had the infection 
concurrently with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Among 23 participants with a Grade 3 or 4 infection during 
the study, 1 (4.4%) had the infection concurrently with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. 
Participants Assigned to RP2Ds with Prior T cell Redirection Therapies 
Among 37 participants with an infection (any grade) during the study, 9 (24.3%) had the infection 
concurrently with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Among 14 participants with a Grade 3 or 4 infection during 
the study, 1 (7.1%) had the infection concurrently with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
A TEAE of TLS was reported for 1 participant assigned to 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC. This was a Grade 3 TEAE 
of TLS that started on Day 3, after Step-up Dose 1; study drug was interrupted for this event and was 
not restarted before the participant died of an infection of unknown aetiology on Day 17 that the 
investigator did not consider to be related to study drug. 
Second primary malignancies 
The frequencies of second primary malignancy in RP2D and SC doses lower than RP2D were similar; a 
slightly rate was observed in participants treated at SC doses higher than RP2D (Table 47).

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
For the total All Treated Analysis Set, a worsening postbaseline shift of 1 to 2 toxicity grades was 
commonly observed, and worsening shifts of up to 4 grades from baseline (ie, Grade 0 to Grade 4) 
were observed for neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, and WBC. Similar trends were observed for 
subjects assigned to RP2D, SC non-RP2D, or IV treatments. 
Chemistry 
For the total All Treated Analysis Set a worsening postbaseline shift of 1 to 2 toxicity grades was 
commonly observed. Worsening shifts of 3 or 4 grades from baseline were observed in small numbers 
of participants for most analytes.  
Among treated participants assigned to the RP2Ds, Grade 3 and Grade 4 chemistry laboratory 
abnormalities were infrequent during treatment, including those related to liver function tests such as 
ALT, AST, and serum creatinine; no participants met criteria for Hy’s law.

Coagulation 
Coagulation was assessed at screening, at each step-up dose, at the first 2 treatment doses, and as 
clinically indicated thereafter (including if a participant developed CRS). Grade 3 international 
normalised ratio (INR) increased, activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged, and fibrinogen 
decreased was observed for <4% of participants who received talquetamab, and a Grade 4 worsening 
was observed for decreased fibrinogen for 4.3% of participants with prior T cell redirection therapies 
exposure and 0.9% of treated participants assigned to 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC. Similar trends were 
observed for participants assigned to RP2D, SC non-RP2D, or IV treatment. 
Vital signs and physical findings 
Small fluctuations in vital sign values were observed immediately following administration of study 
drug; however, no clinically meaningful trends were observed. 
Electrocardiograms 
Intensive ECG monitoring was conducted in Phase 1. Mean and median changes from baseline in ECG 
parameters were not considered clinically meaningful. 
In Phase 2, 12-lead ECGs were performed only at baseline or when clinically indicated. Two treated 
participants assigned to 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC (atrial fibrillation, sinus bradycardia) and 6 treated 
participants assigned to 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC (sinus tachycardia in 3 participants, and atrial fibrillation, 
AV block, and loss of consciousness) had a clinically significant abnormality on ECG postbaseline that 
was not reported at screening. Three participants with prior T cell redirection therapies exposure had a 
clinically significant abnormality (supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia) on 
ECG postbaseline that was not reported at screening.

talquetamab monotherapy. Of these, 143 and 145 subjects with no prior T cell redirection therapy 
have been exposed to the RP2D 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and the RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC, respectively 
and 51 subjects with prior T cell redirection therapy received either one of the RP2Ds (0.4 mg/kg 
weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC). Of patients with prior T-cell redirection therapy, only 8 participants 
were assigned to the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC regimen. 
MonumenTAL-1 is a single-arm trial, with no control group against which the safety profile of 
talquetamab could be compared, which limits a comprehensive assessment of safety. The median 
duration of follow-up was 19.0 months for the RP2D 0.4 mg/kg weekly treated participants and 13 
months for the RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W treated population. Median follow-up was 15 months for 
participants with prior T cell redirection therapies. 36.5% of participants assigned to either of the SC 
regimens discontinued study participation. The most frequent reason for study discontinuation were 
death. Furthermore, 76.9% and 58.6% of patients assigned to the RP2D 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and 
RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC, respectively discontinued talquetamab most frequently for progressive 
disease.  
The most common TEAEs were in nervous system disorders, the blood and lymphatic system disorders, 
general disorders and administration site conditions, immune system disorders, gastrointestinal 
disorders. In the RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC treated participants, the most frequently reported TEAEs 
were CRS (79.0%), dysgeusia (50.3%), anaemia (44.8%), weight decreased (41.3%), pyrexia 
(39.2%), neutropenia (35%), lymphopenia (28.0%), thrombocytopenia (27.3%), skin exfoliation 
(28%), asthenia (27.3%), dry mouth (26.6%), diarrhoea (25.2%), dysphagia (23.8%), fatigue 
(24.8%), dry skin (22.4%), nail disorder (22.4%), and rash (21.7%). 
The type and incidence of common TEAEs were generally similar among participants who received 
either of the RP2Ds. TEAEs that occurred at a higher frequency in participants assigned to 0.8 mg/kg 
Q2W than 0.4 mg/kg weekly were dry mouth (40% vs. 26.6%) and skin exfoliation (40% vs. 28%). 
Although interpretation is limited due to a small sample size (n=51), participants with prior T cell 
redirection therapies exposure appeared to have relatively higher incidences of several common TEAEs, 
such as dysgeusia, dry mouth, neutropenia, pruritis, and fatigue, and lower incidences of lymphopenia, 
diarrhoea, and asthenia than participants without prior T cell redirection therapies exposure. 
CRS, cytopenias, dysgeusia, as well as skin exfoliation were the most commonly reported treatment-
related TEAEs. Cytopenias, together with infections hypophosphataemia and pneumonia, were the 
most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 events. 
Hypertension AEs were reported for 9.4% of patients in all treated population, however most cases 
were either confounded by prior medical history or events resolves on treatment and thus there is no 
need to include this AE in the SmPC.   
As of the clinical cut-off, 15% of subjects in the-all treated analysis set had died. The incidence of 
deaths during the study was higher for participants with prior T cell redirection therapies exposure (16 
subjects (31.4%)) than participants without prior T cell redirection therapies exposure (30 subjects 
(21.0%) for the RP2D 400 ug/kg weekly and 18 subjects (12.4%) for the RP2D 800 ug/kg Bi-weekly). 
Progressive disease was the most commonly reported cause of death for participant with prior T-cell 
exposure (all but one). This may be attributable to differences in disease status at baseline. 
The incidence of Grade 5 TEAEs within 30 or 60 days was similar for treated participants assigned to 
0.4 mg/kg weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC. No participants with prior T cell therapies exposure 
experienced a Grade 5 TEAE. None of Grade 5 TEAEs within 30 or 60 days were judged by the 
investigator to be related to talquetamab (one participant each with grade 5 basilar artery occlusion, 
acute respiratory failure, infection, pulmonary embolism, fungal sepsis, septic shock, 2 participants 
with COVID-19).

At least 1 serious TEAE was reported for 53.1% of participants assigned to RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC 
and 48.3% of participants assigned to RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Bi-Weekly. The most common events were 
CRS, pyrexia, ICANS, pneumonia and febrile neutropenia.  
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in a high proportion of subjects (77% in participants 
assigned to either of the RP2Ds and regardless of prior T cell exposure). These events were mostly 
Grade 1 or 2, but 5 subject (1.5%) experienced Grade 3 CRS. One participant discontinued treatment 
due to CRS. Among participants without prior T cell redirection treated at the 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC 
dose schedule, CRS rates after the first three doses (step-up Dose 1, step-up Dose 2, and Cycle 1 Day 
1) were 33.6%, 49.0% and 26.6% respectively, with a CRS rate of 4.2% after Cycle 1 Day 8. Among 
participants without prior T cell redirection treated at 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC dose schedule, CRS rates 
after the first three doses (step-up Dose 1, step-up Dose 2, and step-up Dose 3) were 26.2%, 40.7% 
and 34.5%, respectively, with a CRS rate of 13.1% after C1D1.   
Events of CRS were generally of a transient nature (median duration was 17 hours when calculated). 
Multiple CRS events occurred in 30% of participants, with worsening at a subsequent event for 4.4% of 
participants. Worsening of CRS severity only occurred during step-up dosing or cycle 1 and each event 
resolved.  
Median time to onset of CRS was 2.0 days. In Phase 2, median time to onset of CRS in hours was 26.5 
(range: 0.1 to 167.3).  Approximately 5% and 8% of CRS events occurring in participants without prior 
T cell redirection treated with 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC started more than 48 
hours after talquetamab administration. The majority of these events were of Grade 1. In all Grade 2 
cases (n= 4 treated with 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC), the participants were hospitalised. Only 2 (1.4%) and 3 
(2.1%) CRS events started after 72 hours and the majority of these events were Grade 1. In the Grade 
2 case (n= 1 treated with 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC), the participant was hospitalised. As the large majority 
of the first CRS events occurred in association with the step-up dosing schedule, focusing on this 
period with more intensive monitoring requirements as recommended in the SmPC is considered 
appropriate.  
Most symptoms of CRS had maximum severity of Grade 1 or Grade 2. Grade 3 symptoms of CRS 
included pyrexia, hypotension, dyspnoea, hypoxia, and sinus tachycardia. One participant (0.7%) had 
Grade 4 aspartate aminotransferase increased and one participant had grade 4 hypotension. No Grade 
5 symptoms were reported.  
Supportive measures, including the use of tocilizumab, were used for management of CRS in a 
substantial proportion of subjects and the SmPC provides detailed recommendations for the 
management of these type of events.  A Patient Card is also included as an additional risk minimisation 
measure to further mitigate the risk of CRS, by increasing patient awareness of signs and symptoms 
requiring medical attention. 
Neurotoxicity events attributable to talquetamab were reported in 28.9% of subjects assigned to either 
RP2Ds regardless of prior T cell exposure, mostly of grade 1 and 2. Six subjects (2.6%) experienced 
grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity events. The most common reported neurotoxicity events were ICANS (10%) 
and headache (9.1%). The most common serious AEs were ICANS.  Neurotoxicity events were 
reported during step-up dosing, in cycle 1, and in later treatment cycles. Anakinra was used to treat 
neurotoxicity in one participant. By the clinical cut-off, 66% of related neurotoxicity events had 
resolved, with a median duration of 3.5 days.  
Motor dysfunction grouped terms (dysgraphia, dysphonia, gait disturbance, muscle spasms, muscular 
weakness, and tremor) were reported in 16 (4.7%) participants, considered related to talquetamab by 
the investigator.  Whether bispecific antibodies can cross the blood-brain remains unclear, but GPRC5D 
expression on cerebellum may be a plausible explanation for the motor dysfunction observed as a 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 137/155 
 
 
 
possible GPRC5D off-target toxicity. Therefore, in the absence of controlled data, the role of 
talquetamab in the onset of motor dysfunction cannot be excluded. 
Sensory neuropathy (10%) (grouped term includes: dysaesthesia, hypoaesthesia, hypoaesthesia oral, 
neuralgia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, sciatica, and vestibular neuronitis), dizziness (12%) 
(grouped term includes: syncope and vertigo), and motor dysfunction (11%) (grouped term includes: 
dysgraphia, dysphonia, gait disturbance, muscle spasms, muscular weakness, and tremor) were 
included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
ICANS events were reported for 10% of participants. Serious and Grade 3 ICANS were reported for 
3.8% and 2.3% of participants and one Grade 4 ICANS was reported. Importantly, one fatal ICANS 
event related to talquetamab was reported in MonumenTAL-1 in the China cohort. The subject died due 
to ICANS syndrome Grade 3 occurring 6 days after the Cycle 1 Day 1 dose of 400 μg/kg SC and 
concurrently with CRS. The investigator considered the event of ICANS to be very likely related to 
talquetamab. According to the applicant, a possible deviation in management of this patient could be a 
potential reason for the fatal outcome. 
The median time from last dose of talquetamab to onset of ICANS was 28 hours and thus the 
recommended 48 hours for patient monitoring and the management of ICANS risk as proposed in the 
SmPC is considered appropriate. Detailed guidance on the management and mitigation of ICANS is also 
provided in the SmPC and PL including a warning to indicate the absence of data of use of talquetamab 
in patients with CNS involvement of myeloma or other clinically relevant CNS pathologies A Patient 
Card is also included as an additional risk minimisation measure to further mitigate the risk of ICANS, 
by increasing patient awareness of signs and symptoms requiring medical attention. Finally, all health 
care professional educational materials who are expected to prescribe or administer talquetamab shall 
be provided with medical education material to ensure awareness of the risk of neurologic toxicity 
including ICANS and facilitate identification, management and monitoring of those risks. A survey to 
measure the effectiveness of the HCP Educational Materials is also planned.  
Post baseline IgG values of less than 500 mg/dl consistent with hypogammaglobulinaemia have been 
reported in reported in 64% of patients treated with talquetamab at the 0.4 mg/kg weekly dose 
schedule, 66% of patients at the 0.8 mg/kg biweekly dose schedule. Therefore, 
hypogammaglobulinaemia was included as an ADR and in the SmPC with a reminder that patients 
should be treated according to local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions, antibiotic 
or antiviral prophylaxis, and administration of immunoglobulin replacement. 
Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have been 
observed in patients who received talquetamab. The majority of cytopenias occurred during the first 8 
to 10 weeks. Complete blood counts should be monitored at baseline and periodically during 
treatment. Supportive care should be provided per local institutional guidelines. Patients with 
neutropenia should be monitored for signs of infection. Talquetamab treatment should be withheld as 
described in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Serious infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have been reported in participants 
treated with talquetamab. The most frequently reported (≥5%) were upper respiratory tract infection, 
COVID-19, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, bronchitis, and nasopharyngitis. Infection onset was 
distributed evenly over the course of study treatment. Among participants treated with either of SC 
dosages regardless of prior T cell redirection therapy (N=339), Grade 3 or Grade 4 infections occurred 
in 19% of patients, and fatal infections occurred in 1.5% of patients (5 patients) including 2 
participants with COVID-19 pneumonia, and 1 participant each with fungal sepsis, septic shock and 
“infection” (unknown aetiology).  
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 138/155 
 
 
 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment with 
talquetamab and treated appropriately. Prophylactic antimicrobials should be administered according to 
local guidelines. Talquetamab should not be administered in patients with active serious infection and 
should be withheld as detailed in the SmPC. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if 
signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur.  
Immune response to vaccines may be reduced when taking talquetamab. The safety of immunisation 
with live viral vaccines during or following talquetamab treatment has not been studied. Vaccination 
with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment, during 
treatment, and at least 4 weeks after treatment.  
A TEAE of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) was reported for 1 participant assigned to 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC. 
This was a Grade 3 TEAE of TLS considered related to talquetamab. Considering that monitoring, 
recognition, and treatment of TLS is part of standard oncology medical practice, and that these events 
could continue to be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance, the inclusion of TLS as an ADR or 
as a Warning/Precaution specifically for talquetamab in the SmPC is not warranted at this time.  
With talquetamab, in all treated population, 16 cases (3.2%) of second primary malignancies were 
diagnosed. All were considered as not related to talquetamab by investigators. Overall, based on 
current evidence, it can be agreed that the reporting rate of second primary malignancies is consistent 
with medical literature. However, the applicant is recommended to continue to monitor the second 
primary malignancies in the ongoing clinical trials and in the post marketing setting through routine 
pharmacovigilance and report in upcoming PSUR. 
Most events of weight decreased occurred in cycle 2 or later. This AE led to reduced dosing (3.9%) and 
skipped doses (3.9%). Treatment discontinuation incidence was low (1.2%). In some participants, 
weight decreased occurred concurrently with dysgeusia, dry mouth, and decreased appetite 
concurrently. Warning on Weight loss was included in the section 4.2 within the oral toxicity 
paragraph. Despite management with dose reductions, and modifications, only few AEs of weight 
decreased (33%) were resolved. However, the low rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse 
events of weight decreased may indicate that these events were adequately controlled following 
institutional guidelines for intervention and with the proposed dose modifications. 
Oral toxicity including dysgeusia, dry mouth, dysphagia, oropharyngeal pain, stomatitis and decreased 
appetite were common AEs and over time significant weight loss occurred. Oral toxicities were often 
reported concurrently and were managed by dose reductions and skipped doses with supportive care. 
Appropriate warnings and management guidelines for oral toxicity have included in SmPC.  
Skin toxicity including non-rash skin reactions and rash TEAEs, occurred in patients who received 
talquetamab with either of the RP2Ds. Dose modifications guidelines were included in the SmPC for 
skin toxicity. Rash TEAEs were reported for 34.8% of participants. The maximum severity was grade 3 
(3.5%). In a minority of participants, rash led to dose skips (4%), reductions (<1%), or delays (<1%). 
By the clinical cut-off date, 88% and 72.3% of rash events had resolved, with a median duration of 28 
and 26 days for patients assigned to the weekly and biweekly dosage, respectively. Warnings and 
precautions related to rash including maculo-papular rash, erythema, and erythematous rash were 
included in the SmPC which is endorsed.  
Non-rash skin toxicity TEAEs (skin exfoliation, dry skin, pruritus, or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
syndrome) were reported for 65.1%of participants Adverse events were mostly of Grade 1 and Grade 
2, with one event of Grade 3 pruritis reported. Resolution of non-rash skin toxicity occurred in about 
50% of participants who experienced these adverse events. The rate of discontinuation of treatment 
was however very low. Warnings for skin reactions in section 4.4 include non-rash skin toxicity as well 
as rash toxicity.

EMA/365426/2023

Nail disorder TEAEs including brittle nails, cracking nails, painful nails, and loss of nails, were common 
(reported in 56% treated with talquetamab. Most of these events were Grade 1 and generally not 
associated with treatment discontinuations. Only 1 participant in the cohort 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC 
required dose modification. 66.3% and 70.4% of nail disorder events were reported as not recovered 
or not resolved at 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC, respectively. Instructions for dose 
modifications for nail disorders are also included in the SmPC. 
Laboratory values fluctuated within the normal range for most parameters. However, data are limited 
at later timepoints. Grade 1 to 2 abnormalities in clinical chemistry parameters were common. No 
participants met criteria for Hy’s law.  
INR increased, activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged and fibrinogen decreased occurred 
frequently in the study and have been included as ADRs in the SmPC. Of the 12 thrombotic events 
(3.5%) in the total RP2Ds analysis set, 3 were concurrent with CRS. Although the inflammation and 
the cytokines’ storm might be involved in thrombotic events, the limited numbers do not allow drawing 
definitive conclusions and current wording in the product information is considered sufficient. 
Treatment emergent related cardiac disorders were reported in 6.3%, 10.3% and 17.6% in 
participants treated with 0.4 mg/kg weekly, 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC and in the previously exposed to T cell 
redirection therapy cohorts respectively. All AEs were Grade 1 or 2, generally concomitant with CRS 
and all resolved. Available data do not suggest that there is a risk of QT prolongation or cardiac toxicity 
with talquetamab.  
Safety profile seems less favourable for patients with prior CAR-T therapy compared to patients who 
have received prior bispecific therapy. Numerically higher discontinuations (11.1% vs 0%), COVID-19 
TEAEs (19.4% vs 0%), weight decreased AEs (36% vs 16%) and grade 3 CRS (2.7% vs 0%) were 
observed in participants who received prior CAR-T therapy compared to patients with prior bispecific 
therapy. Nevertheless, serious AEs were higher among patients who have received prior bispecific 
therapy than patients with prior CAR-T therapy. Given the low number of subjects in each subgroup, 
no clear conclusion could be drawn. Safety in patients with prior CART-cell is included as missing 
information in the RMP and additional information in this subpopulation will be collected through the 
ongoing study MMY1001. 
136 participants in the total All Treated Analysis Set received ≥12 months of study treatment (47 
treated participants without prior T cell redirection therapy assigned to 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC, 39 
treated participants without prior T cell redirection therapy assigned to 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC, and 15 
participants with received prior T cell redirection therapy). The incidence of TEAEs, TEAE severity, 
serious TEAEs, and deaths due to TEAEs reported 12 months or more after the start of treatment was 
lower compared with reporting rates over the full treatment period. However, the incidence of weight 
decreased events reported 12 months or more after the start of treatment were a higher in 
participants assigned to 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC than 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and participants assigned to 
RP2Ds with prior T cell redirection therapies (20%, vs 6.4%, vs 15.4%, respectively). 
Immunogenicity data is available for 328 subjects treated with any dose of SC talquetamab. 106 of 
328 (32.3%) subjects were identified as positive for anti-talquetamab antibodies. There appeared to 
be a trend for a higher CRS, sARR and ISR in ADA-positive participants than in ADA-negative 
participants among participant treated RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC and with prior T cell redirection 
therapies. However, the low event rates for sARRs and ISRs, preclude drawing a definite conclusion 
regarding the effect of the neutralising ADAs on clinical parameters.in combination with the low ADA 
incidence rate, limited a definitive conclusion regarding the impact of ADAs on these events. In 
addition, several ADA positive samples were not evaluated for Nab and the applicant justified this due 
to unevaluable samples exceeding the drug tolerance that was validated at lower talquetamab 
concentrations than that reached during the drug development. According to the applicant a new assay 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 140/155 
 
 
 
to detect neutralizing antibodies to talquetamab has recently been validated and all ADA positive 
samples tested in Study 4MMY1001 will be re-assessed using this new method. It is recommended that 
the applicant submits the validation report of the new method together with the samples re-analysis with 
this new method when available. 
Permanent discontinuation of talquetamab was required infrequently (6.7%). The most frequent 
adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were ICANS (1.1%), weight decreased (0.9%) 
and dysgeusia (0.7%). The incidence of TEAEs leading to cycle delay or dose modification was high; 
71.3% for participants assigned to 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and 57.2% for participants assigned to 0.8 
mg/kg Q2W SC. 
The nature of AEs requiring treatment modifications is consistent with the general safety profile of 
talquetamab, the most common reasons being CRS, pyrexia, Covid-19, upper respiratory tract 
infection, weight decreased, rash and neutropenia.  
There is no available data on talquetamab use in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Human IgG is 
known to cross the placenta after the first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, talquetamab has the 
potential to be transmitted after the first trimester of pregnancy from the mother to the developing 
foetus. Therefore, talquetamab use is not recommended for women who are pregnant or for women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception. It is not known whether talquetamab is excreted in 
human milk. Because the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants is unknown for 
talquetamab, patients should not breast-feed during treatment with talquetamab and for at least 3 
months after the last dose. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
As duration of exposure to talquetamab and corresponding follow-up of patients in MMY1001 is 
relatively short, further data from subsequent data lock-points are expected in order to further 
characterise the long-term safety of talquetamab and the important identified risks associated with its 
use. This includes an updated safety report for MMY1001 which is expected to be available by the end 
of 2024. Additional safety data for the known important identified risks with talquetamab, will be 
required from the ongoing comparative MMY3002 study which will support eventual conversion to a full 
MA for Talvey. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of talquetamab monotherapy in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, including 
participants with prior T cell redirection with CAR-T therapy or bispecific antibody treatment has been 
studied in a single-arm trial. The total number of subjects studied to date enables a reasonable 
characterisation of the overall safety profile and common adverse events, but the lack of a concurrent 
control group as well as the overall short duration of follow-up limit a comprehensive assessment. 
The safety profile of talquetamab, seems to be in line with what is expected from bispecific antibody 
and T cell activation with regards to CRS, cytopenias, and most of the neurological findings, ICANS 
included. Warnings and recommendations in the product information in conjunction with Patient Card 
to be distributed to all patients/caregivers who are expected to use talquetamab are expected to 
minimise those risk. Appropriate guidance for the management of other key risks associated with 
talquetamab use such as motor dysfunction, infections, skin and nail toxicities and oral toxicity is 
included in the product information.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 144/155 
 
 
 
 
 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD-to be determined). The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Talvey (talquetamab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is requesting a Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) for talquetamab in the 
following indication: as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory 
agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard of care treatment for multiple myeloma includes regimens from 3 distinct therapeutic 
classes: proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), and anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibodies. During disease course, all patients eventually relapse and become refractory to 
existing treatments and treatment guidelines for MM do not give specific recommendations after

multiple relapses. Among available therapies, no satisfactory treatment exists in the RR settings of the 
disease. 
In the last decade, a number of new targeted therapies has emerged (anti CD38, anti SLAMF7, anti 
BCMA), and in conjunction with previous therapies (IMiDs, IP corticosteroids, alkylating agents and 
anthracyclines) have significantly improved survival for patients and number of various combinations 
are used in current practice. The recent arrival of T-cell redirection therapies, including CAR-T cells and 
BCMA/CD3 bispecific antibodies, has added additional treatment options in this condition. 
However multiple myeloma is still an incurable and lethal disease for which there is a significant unmet 
need, especially after refractoriness failure to the three major lines of therapies is achieved (IMiD, IP 
and anti-CD38). With recent practice to combine multiple treatment, multi-refractoriness emerges on 
early lines of treatment, creating a new unmet medical need for RRMM patients.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The basis of evidence for use of talquetamab monotherapy is derived from efficacy and safety results 
from a single pivotal phase 1/2 Study 64407564MMY1001 (MonumenTAL-1): A phase 1/2, first-in-
human, open-label, dose escalation study of talquetamab in Subjects with R/R MM.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
ORR according to the 2016 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response Criteria as 
assessed by the IRC was 74.1% (CI95%: 66.1%, 81.1%) for the 0.4mg/kg QW and 71.1% (CI95%: 
63.7%, 78.9%) for the 0.8mg/kg Q2W analysis group. Median DOR was 9.5 months (CI95%: 6.7, 
13.3) for the 0.4mg/kg QW analysis group and not reached (CI95%: 13, NE) for the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W 
analysis group.  
The median TTR was similar in both cohorts (1.2 months (range: 0.2 to 10.9) for the 0.4mg/kg QW 
and 1.3 months (range: 0.2 to 9.2) for the 0.8mg/kg Q2W.  
Median PFS was 7.5 months (CI95%: 5.7, 9.4) 2 in the 0.4mg/kg QW and 14.2 months (95% CI 8.4, 
NE) in the 0.8mg/kg Q2W cohorts. 
The 12-month overall survival rate (95% CI) was 76.4% (68.3, 82.7) for RP2D 0.4 mg/kg QW SC 
analysis set and 77.4% (69.1, 83.7) for the RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC analysis set. 
MRD results are comparable between RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC and RP2D 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC, with 
30.8% participants (95% CI: 23.3%, 39.0%) and 29.7% participants (95% CI: 22.4%, 37.8%) 
achieving MRD negativity at 10-5 respectively, and 21% (CI95%14.6; 28.6) and 20.7% (CI95%: 
14.4;28.2) achieving MRD negativity at 10-6 respectively.  
Additional subgroup information in patients with prior T-cell redirection therapy were provided, with 
62.7% ORR (CI95%: 48.1, 75.9), a median DOR of 12.7 months (95% CI: 3.7, not estimable) and an 
estimated OS rate at 12 months at 59.6% (95% CI: 41.7%, 73.7%). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study MMY1001 was an uncontrolled, open-label, exploratory trial whose design is not suitable to 
provide confirmatory evidence as it is not possible to assess the potential impact of selection bias or 
interpret meaningfully time to event endpoints.  
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 146/155 
 
 
 
Subjects in the pivotal study were generally fit, and patients with reduced performance status 
(baseline ECOG PS score ≥ 2-9% across cohorts) or aged ≥75 years (range 8-22% across cohorts) 
were underrepresented, and no data are currently available in rare and aggressive forms of MM (e.g., 
plasma cell leukaemia, MM with meningeal involvement). Furthermore, exclusion criteria in study 
MMY1001 included known clinical markers of MM progression (i.e., severe hypercalcaemia, renal failure 
and anaemia), possibly resulting in a selected patient population that might have excluded subjects 
with rapid/severe clinical progression. High levels of missing data in relevant variables such as 
cytogenetics further increase the uncertainty around the generalisability of the results.  
A trend towards higher rates of response in fitter and less heavily pre-treated subjects (i.e., patients 
with baseline ECOG PS score 0 and <4 prior lines of therapy) was observed, as well as a trend towards 
lower ORRs in subjects with ISS/R-ISS stage III, reduced baseline renal function (i.e., ≤60 ml/min), 
extramedullary plasmacytoma (ORR 42.2 – 47.4% across talquetamab regimen cohorts). Limited 
sample size in relevant subgroups did not allow, however, to draw robust conclusions. Similarly, the 
reduced sample size and short follow-up question the robustness of the results observed in subjects 
who had received prior anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapies and bispecific monoclonal antibodies. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the RP2D 0.4 mg/kg Weekly SC treated participants, the most frequently reported TEAEs were CRS 
(79.0%), dysgeusia (50.3%), anaemia (44.8%), weight decreased (41.3%), pyrexia (39.2%), 
neutropenia (35%), lymphopenia (28.0%), thrombocytopenia (27.3%), skin exfoliation (28%), 
asthenia (27.3%), dry mouth (26.6%), diarrhoea (25.2%), dysphagia (23.8%), fatigue (24.8%), dry 
skin (22.4%), nail disorder (22.4%), and rash (21.7%). The type and incidence of common TEAEs 
were generally similar among participants who received either of the RP2Ds. 
Permanent discontinuation of talquetamab was required infrequently (6.7%). The most frequent 
adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were ICANS (1.1%), weight decreased (0.9%) 
and dysgeusia (0.7%). The incidence of TEAEs leading to cycle delay or dose modification was high; 
71.3% for participants assigned to 0.4 mg/kg weekly SC and 57.2% for participants assigned to 0.8 
mg/kg Q2W SC. 
The incidence of Grade 5 TEAEs during the study was similar for treated participants assigned to 0.4 
mg/kg weekly SC or 0.8 mg/kg Q2W SC. No participants with prior T cell therapies exposure 
experienced a Grade 5 TEAE. None of the Grade 5 TEAEs occurring within 30 or 60 days were judged 
by the investigator to be related to talquetamab.  
Among the 339 patients who were treated with talquetamab at either of the recommended dosing 
regimen and regardless of prior exposure to T cell redirection therapy, CRS occurred in 77% of 
patients. Most events were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 events occurring in 1.5% of patients. 
Neurotoxicity events were reported for 28.9% of patients, mostly of grade 1 and 2, and 2.6% of 
patients who experienced grade 3 or grade 4 neurotoxicity events. 
ICANS occurred in 10% of patients (N=265). Most events were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 and serious 
events occurring in 2.3% and 3.8% of patients, respectively. In addition, one fatal ICANS event was 
reported in the China cohort of the study. 68% of ICANS events occurred concurrently with CRS. The 
median time to onset of ICANS was 28 hours from the last dose, 68% of events started within 48 
hours from the last dose, and the median duration of ICANS was 9 hours. 
Infections occurred in 64% of patients. Grade 3 or Grade 4 infections occurred in 20% of patients, and 
fatal infections occurred in 1.5% of patients. All considered unrelated to talquetamab by investigators.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The key uncertainty relates to the single-arm nature of the study, and the absence of a control group 
in a heavily pre-treated patient population, which compromises a comprehensive assessment of the 
safety associated with talquetamab.  
The size of the safety population is currently limited for patients who received prior T-cell redirection 
therapy (N=51). Long-term safety and safety in patients with prior CART-cell are missing and 
additional information is expected from the submission of the final study report for Study 
64407564MMY1001 and the planned confirmatory phase 3 study (Study 64407564MMY3002).

Notes: Clinical Cut-off for safety: 16 May 2022, 
Incidence are based on number of patients treated with talquetamab at either of the recommended 
dosing regimen and regardless of prior exposure to T cell redirection therapy (N=339) unless otherwise 
specified 
*ICANS were only collected for Phase 2. Denominator is based on number of patients in Phase 2 
(N=265)  
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy data from uncontrolled study MMY-1001 showed that treatment with talquetamab 
administered at either 0.4 mg/Kg weekly or 0.8 mg/Kg Q2W resulted in high ORRs in a heavily pre-
treated population of patients with RRMM. This is considered of clinical relevance in a population 
characterised by widespread chemoresistance.  
Moreover, the durable responses observed with talquetamab, and which are uncommon in such 
advanced settings of disease, are highly suggestive that talquetamab could provide an important 
treatment option at least for a subgroup of patients with RRMM. Overall OS and PFS are promising in 
both proposed dose regimen despite the known limitations in the interpretation of time to event 
endpoints in single arm trials. 
The major risks associated with talquetamab use are CRS and potential fatal ICANS. Despite the high 
incidence of CRS, these events can be managed adequately with the recommendations and guidance 
provided in the product information. ICANS occurred in 10% of patients with some patients 
experiencing grade ≥3. ICANS typically occurred frequently with or few days after CRS events. Like 
CRS, the risk of ICANS can be managed with detailed warnings and recommendations in the product 
information. Management of both risks is expected to be further minimised though the Patient card 
which should enable patients to recognise symptoms easier and seek medical attention promptly.  
Serious infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have also been reported in patients 
receiving talquetamab. In the absence however of a control arm in the registrational study, it is 
difficult to determine the role of talquetamab in the incidence and severity of infection and cytopenias 
AEs especially considering the high underlying prevalence of these events among patients with MM. 
The limited follow-up and the overall limited size of the database also pose uncertainties particularly 
for assessment of very rare events; as such, the safety profile of talquetamab may still be evolving but 
will be further characterised through the ongoing MMY-1001 study and the randomised phase 3 study 
MMY3002. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Available efficacy data suggest that talquetamab represent an additional treatment option for heavily 
pre-treated patients with RRMM. Being the first bispecific monoclonal antibody targeting GPRC5D on 
MM plasma cells, talquetamab might also retain anti-MM activity in subjects refractory to anti-BCMA 
agents.  
In the intended indication, the safety profile could be considered manageable overall with appropriate 
risk minimisation measures. However, the limited follow-up and overall size of the safety database 
particularly for patients with prior T-cell redirection therapy limit a comprehensive assessment of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 150/155 
 
 
 
 
 
risks associated with the use of talquetamab. Severe CRS and ICANS toxicity related to the use of 
talquetamab remain serious issues that should be carefully considered.  
Longer-term safety data, also from appropriately controlled studies, will enable an improved overall 
contextualisation of the safety profile together with a more comprehensive understanding of efficacy.  
In the context of a CMA, the B/R balance is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
To confirm the positive benefit-risk profile, the applicant has initiated a confirmatory phase 3 (study 
MMY-3002 MonumenTAL-3) study which will provide additional efficacy/safety data. Study MMY-3002 
is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of talquetamab in triple combination with daratumumab 
and pomalidomide or as a “doublet” with daratumumab vs. the approved “triplet” regimen 
daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with RRMM who have received at least 1 
prior line of therapy. Approximately 810 subjects will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio, and study 
completion is expected by April 2027. One interim analysis (IA) for efficacy and safety is planned when 
approximately 383 PFS events in all 3 arms combined will have been accumulated.  
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed.  
MM is an in incurable malignancy characterised by a relapsing/remitting behaviour and a progressive 
clinical course. In earlier settings of relapse, chemoresistance is usually limited, several effective 
regimens based on the combination of different mechanisms of action are currently available, and 
treatment choice is guided by patient characteristics/preferences, response to prior lines of therapy 
and previous toxicity/concomitant comorbidities. 
In later MM stages, however, resistance to those drugs that form the backbone of the most active anti-
MM regimens (i.e., proteasome inhibitors [PIs], immunomodulators [IMiDs] and anti-CD38 monoclonal 
antibodies [mAbs]) becomes widespread, refractoriness to treatment is common and responses are 
usually short-lasting. An unmet need for additional treatment options when “standard” approaches 
based on combinations of PI, IMiD and anti-CD38 mAbs have exhausted their activity is therefore, 
recognised.  
Recently, preliminary evidence showing high response rates and the possibility for long-lasting disease 
control in a subset of triple-exposed MM patients has supported the granting of CMA in advanced 
settings of RRMM for BCMA-targeting T-cell redirection therapies (including e.g., CARTs and bispecific 
monoclonal antibodies). With the limits intrinsic in such indirect comparisons, a similar response rate is 
observed with the efficacy data of talquetamab in pivotal study MMY1001 compared to anti-BCMA T-
cell recruiting therapies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365426/2023 
Page 151/155 
 
 
 
Although a trend towards deeper and longer-lasting responses can be observed with ciltacabtagene 
autoleucel, it is acknowledged that talquetamab would represent an “off-the-shelf” option not requiring 
the complex manufacturing and long turnaround time of CAR T-cell therapies. Other options within the 
therapeutic niche with conditional MA include teclistamab, melphalan flufenamide and belantamab 
mafodotin where talquetamab fulfil the unmet medical need to (at least) the same degree. Limits 
inherent in indirect comparisons in such a heterogenous condition should be taken into consideration 
when interpreting such data.  
In addition, despite the similar mechanism of action that relies on T-cell recruiting and activation, the 
different target of talquetamab (GPRC5D) could reduce the risk of cross-resistance with anti-BCMA 
agents, as suggested by preliminary results from the cohort of subjects previously exposed to T-cell 
redirection agents who received talquetamab in study MMY-1001. Indeed, results from participants 
who had received prior T cell redirection therapy such as CAR-T or bispecific antibodies treated with 
talquetamab at the RP2D showed an ORR of 62.7% (95% CI: 48.1%, 75.9%). Therefore, talquetamab 
would provide a treatment alternative in a patient population with limited treatment options after 
failing anti BCMA therapies. 
Overall, an unmet medical need for off-the-shelf therapies aimed at non-cross resistant targets in 
advanced settings of RRMM is acknowledged. Based on the available data, talquetamab could 
represent an additional off-the-shelf treatment option to answer to this medical need.  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
A substantial number of patients are expected to benefit from treatment with talquetamab over the 
period between Conditional Marketing Authorisation and full approval. Taking into account the known 
supply issues for CAR-T therapy, and the short life expectancy under CAR-T alternatives (excluding 
teclistamab which also has a Conditional Marketing Authorisation), immediate availability is considered 
of public health interest. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Talvey is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Talvey is not similar to Darzalex, Imnovid, Farydak, 
Kyprolis, Ninlaro, Blenrep, Abecma, and Carvykti within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Talvey is favourable in the following indication: 
TALVEY is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory 
agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression 
on the last therapy. The

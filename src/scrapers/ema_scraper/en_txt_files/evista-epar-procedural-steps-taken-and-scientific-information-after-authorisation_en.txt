Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to include

30/08/2012 
SmPC and PL 
As requested by the CHMP following the assessment of the 
information about the ADR 'fatal strokes'. Further, 
section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to ensure 
consistency with section 4.4, and the frequency 
calculation for already listed ADRs in section 4.8 has 
been revised to reflect all available post-marketing 
pharmacovigilance data. The Package Leaflet has 
been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to update the annexes in line with 
the latest SmPC guideline and QRD template (version 
8.1). 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
latest PSUR, the MAH has added a paragraph with 
information regarding ‘fatal strokes’ in patients using 
raloxifene versus patients who received placebo to 
subsection c of SmPC section 4.8:  
In the Raloxifene Use for The Heart ‘RUTH’ study, 
raloxifene did not affect the incidence of stroke, compared 
to placebo. However, there was an increase in death due to 
stroke in women assigned to raloxifene. The incidence of 
stroke mortality was 2.2 per 1000 women per year for 
raloxifene versus 1.5 per 1000 women per year for placebo 
(see section 4.4). During an average follow-up of 5.6 years, 
59 (1.2%) raloxifene-treated women died due to a stroke 
compared to 39 (0.8%) placebo-treated women. 
The ADR ‘fatal strokes’ has also been added as an 
‘uncommon’ adverse reaction in the ADR table in SmPC 
section 4.8.  
Further, the MAH has recalculated the frequencies of the 
adverse reactions arising in the post-marketing setting

guideline. The Package Leaflet has been revised to reflect 
these recalculations. 
Changes were also made to the SmPC and Package Leaflet 
to bring the product information in line with the current 
QRD template (version 8.1), which were reviewed and

SmPC, 
The MAH submitted in this type II variation the final results 
(SPC) as follows: 
a) Update of section 4.8 with adverse events from 
clinical trial RUTH. 
b) Update of section 5.1 with information on 
vertebral fracture, Bone Mineral Density (BMD),  
cardiovascular risk and risk of breast cancer from 
RUTH and CORE clinical trials. 
Relevant sections of the Package Leaflet (PL) were 
updated accordingly. 
The latest QRD version has been implemented in the 
Labelling and 
of three clinical trials (CORE, RUTH and STAR) assessing 
PL 
the effects of raloxifene on the incidence of invasive breast 
cancer and cardiovascular events.  
The CORE trial was a follow-up to the MORE registration 
trial of 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. 
The CORE study was a multinational, double-blind trial that 
enrolled women who had been randomized in the MORE 
osteoporosis treatment trial for an additional 4 years of 
follow-up.  The primary objective was to compare the long-
term effect of raloxifene versus placebo on the reduction in 
incidence of invasive breast cancer.  A secondary objective 
was to assess the effect of raloxifene on the incidence of

The RUTH study was a multinational, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo controlled trial conducted in 
postmenopausal women at risk for major coronary events.  
A total of 10,101 women were enrolled and randomized to 
one of two therapy groups.  The active treatment phase 
ended after the last randomized patient had been followed 
for  5 years.  The primary objectives of this study were to 
assess whether treatment with raloxifene, compared with 
placebo, reduced the incidence of: 
1) the combined endpoint of coronary death, nonfatal 
(including silent) myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalized 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) other than MI; and  
2) invasive breast cancer.   
Secondary endpoints included: Cardiovascular (CV) death, 
nonfatal (including silent) MI, hospitalized ACS other than 
MI, myocardial revascularization, and stroke, assessed 
separately and as a combined endpoint, coronary death, 
all-cause mortality, hospitalized ACS, all-cause 
hospitalization, non-coronary arterial revascularization or 
nontraumatic lower extremity amputation, all breast 
cancer, fractures and venous thromboembolism (VTEs).

The MAH submitted a variation to update the benefit/risk 
an update in the sections 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and 2, 4

profile of raloxifene based on the CORE, STAR trials and 
preliminary results of the RUTH trial. As the final study 
report for the RUTH trial was not available at time of the 
submission of this variation, the main focus of the current 
evaluation was to assess the clinical significance of the 
increased incidence of fatal stroke observed in the RUTH 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
study based on a further analysis of the preliminary data on

fatalities due to stroke in raloxifene and placebo groups.  
Hence the MAH has submitted a cumulative review of their 
global safety database for spontaneous raloxifene cases 
reporting stroke or death, including death due to stroke in 
addition to clinical trial data from the CORE, RUTH and 
STAR trials. Overall, the CHMP considers that the 
benefit/risk assessment of raloxifene remains favorable 
based on the available data from the CORE and STAR trials 
and the preliminary results of the RUTH trial. Regarding the 
risk of stroke mortality an amendment to the section 4.4 of 
the SPC was proposed by the CHMP and implemented 
accordingly by the MAH. The sections 4.8 and 4.9 have also 
been updated according to new post-marketing data on 
adverse reactions (blood and lymphatic disorders, 
peripheral oedema and vascular disorders) and overdose 
respectively.

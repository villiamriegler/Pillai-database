updates of the SmPC generated from different data 
sources. 
In relation to pregnancy, data on animal studies showed 
there were no nirmatrelvir-related severe manifestations of 
developmental toxicity at the highest dose tested in rats 
and rabbits. There were no nirmatrelvir-related adverse 
effects on pre- and post-natal development up to the 
highest dose tested in rats. Clinical data included identified

to include final clinical efficacy and safety data based 
on the pivotal C4671005 study. Section 5.1 of the 
SmPC is also updated to include the antiviral activity 
of nirmatrelvir, against the sub-variants 
B.1.1.529/BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5, 
antiretroviral resistance information based on in vitro 
assays and viral load rebound and treatment-
emergent mutations observed in clinical practice.

Update of section 5.2 of the SmPC in order 
to update pharmacokinetic data on the effect of food 
on oral absorption following the submission of the 
results from studies C4671012, C4671013, C467104, 
C4671015 and C4671019.  The first four studies are 
DDI studies conducted in healthy volunteers, with 
dabigatran, midazolam, carbamazepine and 
itraconazole, respectively. C4671019 was a phase 1, 
open-label, randomised, single dose, 2-sequence, 2-
period crossover study to evaluate the effect of high-
fat meal on the relative bioavailability of nirmatrelvir 
boosted with ritonavir following after single oral dose 
administration in healthy adult participants.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
going clinical trials: in 4 of the 7 cases, female study 
participants received placebo, in 3 of the 7 cases the 
pregnancies occurred in female partners of male study 
participants receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. There were no 
associated adverse events in any of the 3 cases. In all 3 
cases the outcome of the pregnancies was unknown at the 
time of reporting. At the time of reporting there were 2 
post-marketing cases of pregnancy. In 1 of the post-
marketing cases, a female took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir at 27 
weeks gestation and adverse events of Ageusia and 
Anosmia were co-reported. In the second post-marketing 
case no adverse were reported. Based on review of 
available pregnancy data, no update to the 
recommendation is considered necessary, although based 
on this review section 4.6 of the SmPC is slightly updated. 
In relation to pharmacodynamic properties, in vitro cell 
culture data showed nirmatrelvir antiviral activity against 
Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 with EC50 
fold changes compared to wild-type of ≤1. Also, a list of 
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro amino acid substitutions selected by 
nirmatrelvir in cell culture (with EC50 fold change >5) have 
been included in the SmPC, although the clinical 
significance of these mutations needs to be further 
understood. Lastly, in relation to antiviral rebound, the 
SmPC was updated to indicate that post-treatment viral 
nasal RNA rebounds were observed on Day 10 and/or Day 
14 in a subset of Paxlovid and placebo recipients in EPIC-
HR, irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms. The incidence of 
viral rebound in EPIC-HR occurred in both the Paxlovid 
treated participants and the untreated (placebo) 
participants, but at higher incidence in the Paxlovid arm

relative risk reduction from 87.8% as reported in the 
C4671005 primary completion date CSR was due to the 
reporting of a late event of a hospitalisation. This was a 
newly reported primary event (COVID-19-related

Based on a safety review on the use of Paxlovid, the 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to add 
hypersensitivity to the list of adverse drug reactions 
with frequency uncommon and anaphylaxis with 
frequency rare, including a warning on 
hypersensitivity reactions, based on a cumulative 
search of the MAH safety database. The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add 
drug-drug interaction information with dabigatran 
and rivaroxaban (P-gp substrate) based on the 
clinical study results from study C4671012, a 
pharmacokinetic study to estimate the effect of 
Paxlovid on the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran; the 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to update 
the drug-drug interaction information of midazolam 
based on the clinical study results from study 
C4671013, a pharmacokinetic study to estimate the 
effect of Paxlovid on the pharmacokinetics of 
midazolam. 
The MAH has taken the opportunity to update 
sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in relation to 
the drug-drug interaction profile for Paxlovid: 
pethidine has been removed as a contraindicated 
medication; tadalafil, silodosin, eplenerone, 
ivabradine, voclosporin, eletriptan, tolvaptan, and 
following changes are included in the product information: 
• 
Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions 
have been reported with Paxlovid. Cases of Toxic Epidermal 
Necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been 
reported with ritonavir, a component of Paxlovid. If signs 
and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity 
reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue 
Paxlovid and initiate appropriate medications and/or 
supportive care. 
• 
Concomitant administration of Paxlovid is expected 
to increase dabigatran concentrations resulting in increased 
risk of bleeding. Reduce dose of dabigatran or avoid 
concomitant use. Refer to the dabigatran Summary of the 
product charactestics (SmPC) for further information. 
Rivaroxaban is not recommended as it’s metabolisation 
may be impacted by the CYP3A4 inhibitory effect of 
Paxlovid but also its P-gp inhibitory effect. 
• 
The new information obtained from a drug-drug 
interaction study conducted with Paxlovid and midazolam 
does not downgrade the magnitude of interaction 
pertaining to inhibition of CYP3A4, although the 
pharmacokinetics information in the SmPC is updated 
accordingly. 
• 
Pethidine exposure is expected to decrease through 
the co-administration with Paxlovid due to the effect of 
ritonavir (as observed through the studies by Ramirez et al 
and Piscitelli et al). This indication will result in the increase

SmPC. Also drugs propoxyphene, bepridil, encainide, 
astemizole, norbuprenophine, vorapaxar and 
desipramine have been removed from the SmPC as 
they are no longer marketed into the EU. Lastly, the 
SmPC was also updated to incite for a 
multidisciplinary approach for best handling the 
potential co-medications. 
The MAH is taking the opportunity to include editorial 
updates in sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC.  
The package leaflet is updated accordingly.

of its metabolite known to be associated with opioid effects. 
Therefore it is recommended to monitor for respiratory 
depression and sedation. 
• 
Sildenafil and tadalafil regardless of their intended 
used, i.e. to treat erectile dysfunction or pulmonary arterial 
hypertension, are contraindicated. 
• 
Ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer inhibits 
CYP3A4 is expected to increase the plasma concentrations 
of immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, everolimus, 
sirolimus and tacrolimus. This co-administration should 
only be considered with close and regular monitoring of 
immunosuppressant serum concentrations, to reduce the 
dose of the immunosuppressant so that to avoid over 
exposure and subsequent increase of serious adverse 
reactions of the immunosuppressant. It is important that 
the close and regular monitoring is performed during the 
co-administration with Paxlovid but also after the treatment 
with Paxlovid.  
• 
Additional contraindicated medication were added 
as a conservative approach: silodosin, eplenerone, 
ivabradine, voclosporin, eletriptan, tolvaptan, and 
apalutamide. 
• 
Propoxyphene, bepridil, encainide, astemizole, 
norbuprenophine, vorapaxar and desipramine have been 
removed from Paxlovid SmPC, as they are no longer 
approved drugs.   
• 
Lercanidipine should be avoided in co-
administration with Paxlovid. The differential 
recommendation as compared to other calcium channel 
inhibitors as lercanidipine is particularly sensitive to 
CYP3A4 inhibition.

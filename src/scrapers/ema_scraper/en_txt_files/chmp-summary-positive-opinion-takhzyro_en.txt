Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Takhzyro 
lanadelumab 
On 18 October 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Takhzyro, 
intended for the prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema.  
Takhzyro, which was designated as an orphan medicinal product on 9 October 2015, was reviewed under 
EMA’s accelerated assessment programme. The applicant for this medicinal product is Shire Pharmaceuticals 
Ireland Limited. 
Takhzyro will be available as a 300-mg solution for injection. The active substance of Takhzyro is 
lanadelumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits active plasma kallikrein proteolytic activity (ATC code: 
B06AC05). Increased plasma kallikrein activity leads to angioedema attacks in patients with hereditary 
angioedema through the proteolysis of high-molecular-weight kininogen and bradykinin. Lanadelumab 
provides sustained control of plasma kallikrein activity and thereby limits bradykinin generation in patients 
with hereditary angioedema. 
The benefit of Takhzyro is its ability to significantly reduce the mean hereditary angioedema attack rate 
compared with placebo. The percentage of patients who were attack free for the last 16 weeks of a controlled 
study was 77% in the group receiving 300 mg Takhzyro every 2 weeks, compared to 3% of patients in the 
placebo group. 
The most common side effects are injection site reactions (including pain,  erythema and bruising). Of these, 
97% were of mild intensity. 
The full indication is: “Takhzyro is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary 
angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older”.  
It is proposed that Takhzyro be made available upon prescription and that treatment is initiated under the 
supervision of a physician experienced in the management of patients with hereditary angioedema.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made

Summary  of  risk  management  plan  for  Lenalidomide 
Krka  
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Lenalidomide  Krka.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of Lenalidomide Krka, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Lenalidomide Krka's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Lenalidomide  Krka's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give 
essential information  to healthcare  professionals and patients  on how  Lenalidomide Krka     should 
be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Lenalidomide  Krka  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Lenalidomide 
Krka's RMP.  
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Lenalidomide  Krka  is  authorised  for  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma  and  follicular  lymphoma  (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains lenalidomide as the active substance and it is given orally. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Lenalidomide  Krka’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Lenalidomide Krka’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/lenalidomide-krka. 
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important  risks  of  Lenalidomide  Krka,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the 
proposed studies for learning more about Lenalidomide Krka's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The medicine’s legal status  —  the  way a medicine is supplied  to the patient (e.g.  with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Lenalidomide  Krka,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk 
minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.  
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Lenalidomide  Krka  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to 
further  investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  taken. 
Important  risks can be regarded  as identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks are  concerns for  which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Lenalidomide Krka. Potential risks are concerns for 
which  an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association has not been  established  yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
The  safety  information  in  the  proposed  Product  Information  is  aligned  to  the  reference  medicinal 
product. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Important identified risk: Teratogenicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide, which is 
medicine 
known  to  cause  serious  birth  defects  and  death  of  the 
foetus. 
In  nonclinical  studies, 
lenalidomide 
induced 
malformations similar to those described with thalidomide. 
Therefore,  a  teratogenic  effect  of  lenalidomide  is  expected 
and lenalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy.

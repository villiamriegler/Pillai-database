The long-term data presented appear to be in line with the 
known efficacy and safety profile of baricitinib in patients 
with RA. The long-term efficacy data do support a claim on 
durable responses regarding low disease activity/remission 
over 6 years, and the long term safety data support that 
there are no apparent differences with the existing safety

study for the assessment of off-label use of 
unique patients in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
(CPRD) (adults and/or paediatrics) with at least 1 recorded 
baricitinib prescription. Twelve of these patients (0.79%;

study results cannot be the basis for determining the safety

reviewed in parallel ongoing procedures. 
B011 study (objective 4) was able to describe the 
occurrence of events relevant to the baricitinib additional 
RMM within a cohort of incident baricitinib users, identified 
low occurrence of selected infections or pregnancies, 
identified 9.3% of patients had their lipids monitored, 
based on the proxy measure of changes in their statin 
medication. The current results from Study B011 suggest 
that prescribers adhered to recommendations within the 
additional RMM and communication of the additional risk 
minimisation key messages for baricitinib is effective.
As part of this procedure, the RMP (v 19.1) has been 
updated to reflect completion of analysis for Objective 4 of 
Study B011, RA cohort, and completion of Study B016. 
Based on the current evaluation, no changes are warranted 
to the additional risk minimisation activities or the SmPC.

In the observational study B023, meta-analysis of results 
MC-B023, a non-interventional PASS which provided 
a comparative assessment of VTE and other risks 
among patients with rheumatoid arthritis with 
baricitinib versus TNF inhibitors listed as category 3 
in the RMP. An RMP (version 18.2) has also been 
updated.
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data
from 14 data sources showed a significantly elevated 
incidence rate ratio for VTE in baricitinib compared with 
TNFi-treated cohorts. The incidence rate of VTE was greater 
among patients treated with baricitinib than with TNFi, with 
a difference of 0.26 (95% CI -0.04, 0.57) per 100 PY. Data 
analysed for this study was primarily from insurance claims 
records and also included the data from RA registries.
Patients compared in these analyses were propensity score-
matched based on risk factors for VTE, including age, sex, 
cancer history, cardiovascular disease, immune disorders, 
diabetes, prescription medication use, and health care 
resource utilisation.
In addition, the study also showed a numerically greater 
Page 6/14
incidence rate ratio (IRR) of incident serious infection and 
MACE in patients with RA treated with baricitinib compared 
with TNFi.
The results of this study were assessed as part of the 
article 20 referral for the Janus kinase inhibitors. For 
further information, please refer to the outcome of the 
referral (Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) | European

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Please refer to Scientific Discussion ‘Idelvion-H-C-3955-II-
order to update information and amend the 
frequencies of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based 
on the final results from study CSL654_3003 listed 
as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is an open-
label, multicentre, uncontrolled study to evaluate the 
safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical response of rIX-
FP with regard to the prevention and treatment of 
bleeding in previously un-treated patients (PUPs) 
with Haemophilia B. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The RMP version 4.1 has also been submitted 
(response to 2nd RSI) and can be accepted. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and 
update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet. 
In addition, this application relates to paediatric 
studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
59’ 
Submission of the final results from study CSL654_3003 
which is an open-label, multicentre, uncon-trolled study to 
evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical response 
of rIX-FP with regard to the prevention and treatment of 
bleeding in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with 
Haemophilia B (listed as category 3 RMP study). 
Consequently, sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have 
been updated to update the information and amend the 
frequencies of adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
IDELVION in the approved indication remains favourable 
and therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing

Extension of indication to include treatment with Epidyolex as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated 
with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) for patients 2 years of age and older 
(without the restriction for use only in conjunction with clobazam), based on the previously generated 
data in patients treated without CLB in the LGS and DS pivotal studies re-evaluated in the context of the 
more recent evidence from study GWEP1521 in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). As a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes in the product 
information. Version 2.1 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
However, during the procedure and in view of the CHMP data assessment, the marketing authorisation 
holder revised the scope the variation and instead of the extension of the indication, proposed the update 
of section 4.8 of the SmPC to provide further details regarding the increased risk of pneumonia as well as 
section 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect the outcome of the P46 011.1 procedure, as concluded in January 
2023. 
Information relating to orphan designation 
EU/3/14/1339 on 15/10/2014 and EU/3/17/1855 on 20/03/2017. Epidyolex was designated as an orphan 
medicinal product in the following indications: 'Treatment of Dravet syndrome' and 'Treatment of Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome', respectively. 
Information on paediatric requirements

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The original Marketing Authorisation for Epidyolex, cannabidiol oral solution (CBD-OS), was granted in EU 
on 19 September 2019, for use as adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with clobazam, in patients 2 years of age and 
older.  
In April 2021, Epidyolex was also approved as an adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with 
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), for patients 2 years of age and older (without restriction to any co-
medications (extension of indication EMEA/H/C/004675/II/0005)). 
In this application, the MAH proposes to update the Epidyolex indication for the use as adjunctive therapy 
of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) for patients 2 
years of age and older, without the restriction for use only in conjunction with clobazam. 
In order to support the proposed extension of indication and demonstrate the independent efficacy of 
CBD-OS, without CLB, in LGS and DS patients, the MAH referred to existing in-vivo non-clinical data, 
which demonstrate the anticonvulsive activity of CBD-OS and its metabolites, and clinical data in patients 
treated with CBD-OS without CLB. The summary of clinical data includes results of subgroup analyses 
conducted in patients with LGS and DS treated without CLB, a meta-analysis of pooled data from patients 
with LGS and DS treated without CLB, the recent TSC results without CLB, and updated real-world 
evidence from patients, caregivers, and claims data. No new non-clinical or clinical data were generated. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In order to support the proposed extension of indication application, no new clinical data were generated 
and provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/254054/2023 
Page 7/23 
 
 
 
 
 
The data presented to support the extension of indication were subgroup analyses conducted in patients 
with LGS and DS treated without CLB, an exploratory meta-analysis of pooled data from patients with 
LGS and DS treated without CLB, the TSC study results and updated real-world evidence. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The MAH reviewed the existing PK data. No new data were generated. 
Similar to the PK data for all patient treated with and without CLB, the PK data in patients treated with 
CBD-OS without CLB show a high degree of overlap between exposure and metabolite concentration and 
the PD effect.  
The exploratory PK/PD analysis in LGS, and TSC patients demonstrated a flat exposure-efficacy 
relationship and found a significant degree of overlap in exposure (AUC) between CBD-OS doses 
administered (25 and 50 mg/kg/day). In the PK/PD assessment in patients with LGS, there was a shallow 
exposure-efficacy relationship reflecting the lower dose range and near doubling of exposure with a 
doubling of CBD-OS dose.  
The exploratory analysis suggests that there may be a saturation of absorption at doses between 20 to 
25 mg/kg/day and above.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
in-vitro studies of CBD drug metabolism and physiologically based PK modelling was provided and 
reviewed in the original MAA. In addition, relevant to this proposed extension of LGS and DS indication, 
the following DDI studies results were included and reviewed in the original MAA: 
- Potential effects of CBD-OS on common ASMs, including CLB, that interact with enzymes involved with 
CBD metabolism, 
- Potential for CYP mediated DDIs using probe substrates to further quantify and refine guidance for 
prescribers. 
In all studies investigating the bidirectional effects of CBD-OS and CLB, there was a consistent increase in 
plasma concentrations of the active CLB metabolite, N-CLB, of the active CBD-OS metabolite, 7-OH-CBD, 
and an increase in N-CLB:CLB ratio. The extent of the elevation in N-CLB exposure (Cmax and AUC) with 
CBD-OS treatment was similar between healthy adult participants, adult epilepsy patients, and pediatric 
epilepsy patients. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
As reviewed in the original MA, PK analyses in LGS patients using concomitant CLB or not demonstrate an 
exposure-response relationship for both parent CBD and active metabolite, 7-OH-CBD, in the probability 
of being a drop-seizure responder. In DS patients, there is no exposure-response relationship 
demonstrated without CLB. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new data was provided in this application. The MAH claims that the existing PK data is relevant to the 
proposed extension of indication.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/254054/2023 
Page 8/23 
 
 
 
 
From the existing PK data, it is agreed that increasing CBD-OS doses beyond 25 mg/kg/day did not 
provide any efficacy advantage but worsened the safety profile in TSC treatment. Similar trend is 
observed for LGS and DS studies.  
There is an inherent interindividual variability in PK of CBD, which supports individualized dose titration to 
maximize effect for patients. 
There is a strong interaction between CBD and N-CLB. 
The CHMP agreed that there might be similar exposure-efficacy relationship in LGS patients using 
concomitant CLB or not. However, it is not possible to demonstrate this relationship for the DS indication. 
For DS, there is no exposure-efficacy relationship demonstrated without CLB, and PK-PD findings cannot 
be generalized to different indications.  
In addition, positive trend in exposure-efficacy cannot be conclusive in the absence of clinical data 
supporting a positive B/R for treatment of LGS or DS patients with CBD-OS and without CLB (see also 
section 2.4.1 - Discussion on clinical efficacy). 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP does not agree that existing PK/PD data are supportive of the proposal to remove the CLB 
restriction in LGS and DS indications. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
No new clinical efficacy data were generated and provided for this extension of indication application.  
Based on the data in patients treated without CLB in the LGS and DS pivotal studies reviewed in the 
original Marketing Authorisation and in the context of the TSC study GWEP1521 
(EMEA/H/C/004675/II/0005), the following analyses were provided: 
1 - Independent and clinically relevant effect of CBD-OS without CLB by subgroup and pooled analysis of 
the patients treated without CLB in the 4 studies in patients with LGS and DS (GWEP1332 CSR 
Amendment 2017, GWEP1414 CSR Addendum 2018, GWEP1423 CSR Addendum 3 2018, GWEP1424 CSR 
Amendment 2019) on: 
a. Change from baseline in frequency of indication-specific seizures (drop seizures in LGS, 
convulsive seizures in DS), 
b. Frequency of treatment responders (patient showing a ≥ 50% reduction in indication-specific 
seizures from baseline), 
c. Frequency of patients showing ≥ 75% and ≥ 90% reductions in indication-specific seizures 
from baseline, 
d. Change from baseline in frequency of total seizures. 
2 - Independent and clinically relevant effect of CBD-OS without CLB in TSC, 
3 - Real-world evidence of the clinical benefit of patients using CBD-OS without CLB collected from 
patients, caregivers, and healthcare claims data.

1. Exploratory subgroup analyses performed in the patients treated without 
CLB in the individual LGS and DS pivotal studies 
The LGS and DS pivotal studies were designed to show efficacy in rare, treatment-resistant orphan 
conditions, where patients are treated with a median of 4 concurrent ASMs. The primary objective was to 
demonstrate significant reductions in LGS- and DS-associated seizures compared with placebo across all 
patients. The key secondary endpoint was included to demonstrate that a greater frequency of patients 
treated with CBD-OS met the 50% responder criteria definition compared to placebo. 
Within the LGS studies, all 3 subgroups (treated without CLB by dose [GWEP1423 20 mg/kg/day; 
GWEP1414 10 and 20 mg/kg/day]) showed directional effects for change on the primary endpoint (drop 
seizures) in favour of CBD-OS (Figure 4-1). 
Within the DS studies, all three subgroups (treated without CLB by dose [GWEP1332B 20 mg/kg/day; 
GWEP1424 10 and 20 mg/kg/day]) showed directional effects for positive change on the primary 
endpoint (convulsive seizures) in favour of CBD-OS (Figure 4-2).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooled LGS and DS 
The MAH conducted a meta-analysis to investigate whether CBD-OS as an active substance has 
antiseizure effects when used without CLB. The meta-analysis combined pooled data from the patients 
treated without CLB from the 4 CBD-OS pivotal studies in patients with LGS or DS and estimated the 
independent treatment effect of CBD-OS without CLB on primary seizure count (drop seizures in LGS and 
convulsive seizures in DS), 50% treatment responder rate, 75% treatment responder rate, 90% 
treatment responder rate, as well as total seizure count. 
Estimates of the treatment effect without CLB derived from the pooled-meta-analysis on reduction in 
primary seizure count are displayed in Figure 4-5.

Estimates of the treatment effect without CLB derived from the pooled-meta-analysis on responder rates 
are displayed in Figure 4-6. 
TSC 
Similar to the results of the LGS and DS studies, TSC patients in study GWEP1521 who were treated with 
concurrent CLB showed the largest treatment response to CBD-OS. However, most patients in study 
GWEP1521 were not taking concurrent CLB [n = 163/224 (73%)] and treatment with CBD-OS produced a 
30% greater treatment effect on the primary endpoint (TSC-associated seizures) compared to placebo 
(Treatment Ratio = 0.70, p<0.001). 
The TSC-associated primary endpoint included both focal and generalized (tonic–clonic, tonic, clonic, and 
atonic) seizure types. Exploratory analysis of the effect of CBD-OS on the two seizure types included in 
the primary endpoint calculation were consistent with the results obtained for the primary endpoint. 
There was a statistically significant 27% greater reduction in focal seizures in patients treated with CBD-
OS without CLB compared with placebo (Treatment Ratio = 0.73, p=0.04) and a statistically significant 
36% greater treatment effect in reduction of generalized seizures (Treatment Ratio = 0.64, p=0.03). 
Patients in GWEP1521 who were treated with CBD-OS without CLB experienced a nominally significant 
25% greater reduction in TSC-associated seizures compared to patients treated with placebo (Treatment 
Ratio [95% CI] = 0.75 [0.59, 0.96], p=0.02).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/254054/2023 
Page 13/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Other data   
Additional data on treatment of CBD-OS without CLB for LGS and DS was collected from 4 sources: 
- Overall and subgroup efficacy results of an OLE study (GWEP1415) that enrolled 681 patients who 
completed the LGS and DS pivotal studies, 
- Findings from the US and Australian expanded access programme, which provided CBD-OS treatment to 
914 patients with intractable epilepsy, including 127 patients with LGS and 74 patients with DS, 
- Results of a retrospective observational study of US claims data assessing healthcare resource 
utilization associated with CBD-OS use among 419 patients with refractory epilepsy without evidence of 
CLB use, 
- Survey findings from 498 caregivers of patients with LGS or DS treated with CBD-OS with and without 
CLB. 
The aim of OLE study GWEP1415 was to assess the long-term safety of CBD-OS as an adjunctive 
treatment for either LGS or DS. The study enrolled patients with LGS from studies GWEP1414 and 
GWEP1423 and patients with DS from study GWEP1332B. Patients were re-titrated at the start of the OLE 
up to the study’s maximum dose of 30 mg/kg/day and maintained on treatment until commercial product 
was available (analyses were conducted up to 24 months). Rates of CBD-OS discontinuation were 35.3% 
for patients treated with CLB and 45.7% for patients treated without CLB.  
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In this application, the MAH did not provide any new clinical evidence from randomized controlled studies 
in the LGS and DS indications. All analyses provided are exploratory in nature and consists of data 
previously evaluated by CHMP in the original MAA. 
Main trials in the original MA 
The pivotal trials for LGS and DS in the original MAA were all designed as double-blind parallel-group 
placebo-controlled trials with a baseline period of 4 weeks and a treatment period of 14 weeks (titration 
phase 2 weeks, maintenance phase 12 weeks), after which the patients either entered an open-label 
extension study or (upon completion/withdrawal) tapered the dose over a 10-day period with a safety 
follow-up 4 weeks after final dose. 
In order to be eligible for the LGS trials, patients had to be aged 2–55 years with a clinical diagnosis of 
LGS. Patients must have had at least 2 drop seizures each week during the first 28 days of the baseline 
period and have a history of slow (< 3.0 Hz) spike-and-wave pattern in an EEG prior to their enrolment 
into the baseline period. Patients must have been taking 1 or more AEDs at a dose which had been stable 
for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and have documented failures on more than 1 AED. The predefined 
primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency. There were 3 
prospectively defined key secondary endpoints: (1) the proportion of patients who achieved 50% 
reduction in drop seizures (responder analysis); (2) the percentage change from baseline in total seizure 
frequency; and (3) the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change (S/CGIC) at last visit. These 
endpoints were tested hierarchically in the above order following analysis of the primary endpoint. 
In order to be eligible for the DS trial, patients had to be aged 2-18 years with a clinical diagnosis of 
Dravet Syndrome confirmed by a committee of independent experts and had to have experienced 4 or 
more convulsive seizures during the 4-week baseline period. Patients must have been taking 1 or more 
AEDs at a dose which had been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. The primary endpoint was 
the percentage change or change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency (average per 28 days) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/254054/2023 
Page 14/23 
 
 
 
 
during the treatment period for CBD-OS compared with placebo. A continuous variable rather than a 
dichotomised variable (responder analysis) was chosen due to the rareness of DS. For the purpose of the 
EU submission, the 50% responder rate was the key secondary endpoint in Study GWEP1332B which is 
considered acceptable. For the EU submission only, the secondary endpoints in Study GWEP1332B were 
tested hierarchically, starting with the key secondary endpoint followed by all other secondary endpoints. 
In Study GWEP1424, a hierarchical gate-keeping procedure was used to control the type I error starting 
with the primary endpoint for the 20 mg/kg/day dose followed by the 10 mg/kg/day dose, then the 1st 
key secondary endpoint for the 20 mg/kg/day dose etc.  
The primary endpoint was met in all four studies with an approximately 40-50% median reduction in the 
active groups as compared to approximately 15-25% in the placebo groups. Specifically for 20 mg/kg 
dose, as the recommended treatment dose, the clear separation of subgroups according to concomitant 
CLB use and significant increase in the effect size was noted (see figure below). Whereas it is 
questionable whether a median difference of 20-25% may in itself be considered clinically relevant, in the 
LGS studies the primary analysis was supported by key secondary analyses including responder analyses 
and global impression of change. In terms of drop seizure free days, the treatment difference in LGS 
corresponded to 3-5 drop seizure free days per 28 days. In DS, the key secondary endpoint (responder 
analysis) was not met in Study GWEP1332B. In Study GWEP1424, the key secondary endpoint analyses 
supported the primary analyses.  
There is not a clear biological rationale for expecting rather similar effect sizes in these two different 
indications. Dravet Syndrome is usually associated with SCN1A mutations, and may likely be considered a 
sodium channel disorder, whereas SCN1A mutations are usually not seen in LGS. It may be that CBD-OS 
has unspecific anticonvulsive properties, but methodological and pharmacokinetic issues must be 
considered as well. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/254054/2023 
Page 15/23 
 
 
 
 
 
At least some of the treatment difference may likely be ascribed to the pharmacokinetic interaction with 
clobazam (leading to increased clobazam active metabolite N-CLB concentrations). CBD-OS and clobazam 
have a complex 2-way metabolic interaction. CBD-OS inhibits CYP2C19 which is required to metabolise 
the active clobazam metabolite N-CLB. This leads to a several fold increase in N-CLB concentration, and 
since N-CLB has an anticonvulsant effect of 20-100% of its parent compound, clobazam, the resulting 
anticonvulsant effect might well correspond to a doubling of the clobazam dose, enough to explain a 
treatment difference of the observed size. In the 3 pivotal trials, there was substantial clobazam 
concomitant treatment at baseline (approximately 50% in LGS and 65% in DS).  
In order to support this proposed extension of indication with the removal the concomitant administration 
of CLB, the MAH performed various analyses intended to demonstrate independent efficacy of CBD-OS. 
However, in all pivotal trials, performing the primary analysis on the subgroup of patients with CLB and 
the subgroup of patients without CLB consistently revealed statistically significant treatment differences in 
the CLB subgroups but no differences in the non-CLB subgroups. Thus, the isolated efficacy of the CBD-
OS and the clinical relevance of such efficacy remained undetermined in LGS and DS patients treated with 
CBD-OS without CLB. Similarly, the key secondary endpoints showed no support (GWEP1332B) or only 
directional support.  
The clinical relevance of the effect in patients not receiving CLB was subject of discussion in a Scientific 
Advisory Group at the time of the original MAA. Overall, the SAG experts expressed doubts about the 
validity of the efficacy data and were not convinced that efficacy of CBD-OS without CLB had been reliably 
demonstrated in statistical terms. Notwithstanding this, the group consisting of experts in the field, were 
split in the interpretation of the clinical relevance of the observed effect. Approximately half of the group 
did not consider the observed effect clinically relevant whereas the other half did indeed consider the 
effect clinically relevant if data were to be considered reliable. Furthermore, as LGS and DS patients 
present a multitude of different types of seizures, the clinical relevance of a 50% reduction in one type of 
seizure frequency was questioned by some experts. The SAG did not support the MAH’s claim that the 
observed smaller effect of CBD-OS in patients off CLB was due to these patients constituting a therapy 
resistant subgroup.  
Supportive data 
Pooled LGS-DS meta-analysis 
As previously asserted, the CHMP maintains that pooling across different endpoints (LGS-associated 
seizures, DS-associated seizures) and doses (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) relies on assumptions that the 
antiseizure response across both doses and conditions are equivalent. The MAH is of the view that there 
is no evidence of a dose-response relationship between 10 and 20 mg/kg/day and no difference between 
10 and 20 mg/kg/day in time to onset of effects (Madan Cohen 2020, Privitera 2021, Wu 2020), and that 
this does not per se suggest that the magnitude of effect at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day is equivalent but would 
support dose pooling in a meta-analysis. This is not agreed as pooling in a meta-analysis not only across 
different trials but also across different indications assumes that the treatment is equally effective in 
different indications, which is not the case as demonstrated across trials in LGS, DS. TSC, Rett syndrome.  
In the pooled analysis, the number of patients treated with placebo (n=127) and CBD-OS without CLB 
(n=132) reach the levels evaluated in pivotal studies in orphan epilepsy indications. Nevertheless, the 
primary endpoint used in the pivotal studies, which is primary seizure count (drop seizures in LGS and 
convulsive seizures in DS), still does not demonstrate a statistically or clinically meaningful difference 
between placebo and active arms with the recommended dose 20 mg/kg/day in the absence of CLB 
(despite large enough numbers). The meta-analysis estimated that “across indications and doses” CBD-
OS without CLB is associated with a 15% reduction in indication-specific seizures. Regardless of the 
uncertainties in individual trials and issues with pooling data across indications and doses, the size of 
effect of CBD-OS without CLB is not considered statistically (nominal) or clinically significant.

EMA/CHMP/254054/2023 
Page 16/23 
 
 
 
 
In addition, there is an increased safety concerns in patients using recommended dose of CBD-OS without 
CLB: The greater magnitude of CBD-OS treatment effect without CLB in patients treated with 10 
mg/kg/day compared to 20 mg/kg/day in the meta-analysis is partially explained by paradoxical increase 
in seizures while increasing dose of CBD-OS from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day. It remains unclear, however, why 
some patients with LGS experienced seizure increases when force titrated to 20 mg/kg/day, as this 
increase in seizures was unique to the 2 LGS studies treated without CLB (GWEP1414, GWEP1423) and 
was not replicated in patients treated with CLB in the LS, or in patients treated with or without CLB in the 
DS or TSC pivotal studies, even at doses as high as 50 mg/kg/day.  
TSC data 
The TSC data cannot validate the independent effect of CBD-OS without CLB in LGS and DS populations. 
Most patients in study GWEP1521 were not taking concurrent CLB [n = 163/224 (73%)] and yet 
treatment with CBD-OS produced a 30% greater treatment effect on the primary endpoint (TSC-
associated seizures) compared to placebo (Treatment Ratio = 0.70, p<0.001). 
The TSC-associated primary endpoint included both focal and generalized (tonic–clonic, tonic, clonic, and 
atonic) seizure types. Exploratory analysis of the effect of CBD-OS on the two seizure types included in 
the primary endpoint calculation were consistent with the results obtained for the primary endpoint. 
There was a statistically significant 27% greater reduction in focal seizures in patients treated with CBD-
OS without CLB compared with placebo (Treatment Ratio = 0.73, p=0.04) and a statistically significant 
36% greater treatment effect in reduction of generalized seizures (Treatment Ratio = 0.64, p=0.03).  
Patients in GWEP1521 who were treated with CBD-OS without CLB experienced a nominally significant 
25% greater reduction in TSC-associated seizures compared to patients treated with placebo (Treatment 
Ratio [95% CI] = 0.75 [0.59, 0.96], p=0.02).  
Hence, in the TSC application (EMEA/H/C/004675/II/0005), CHMP concluded on statistically and clinically 
relevant effect of CBD-OS in TSC indication.  
However, this effect cannot be extrapolated to different indications and, in the absence of conclusive 
clinically relevant effect observed in clinical studies, it cannot be considered as supportive data for 
amending the LGS and DS indications.   
Other data 
The additional data, from non-randomised studies with US LGS and DS patients (expanded access 
program, US caregiver survey, US claims data) and other considered types of epilepsies (US claims) 
should be interpreted with caution due to confounder variables and the observational character of data 
collection. These data cannot be considered supportive in the absence of established positive benefit/risk 
in the pivotal studies.   
During the procedure, a cross-study comparison of fenfluramine and CBD-OS without CLB in LGS was 
also provided and showed little difference in the result. This cross-study comparison, for two different 
products, is however methodological limitation and cannot be use as a basis for approval.  
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
No new clinical efficacy data were generated to support the removal of concomitant CLB for the LGS and 
DS indication.  
There is no conclusive statistically and clinically relevant effect observed with CBD-OD treatment without 
CLB in the individual pivotal trials for LGS and DS, as reviewed during the original MAA.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
No new clinical safety data were generated and provided for this extension of indication application.  
The safety profile for CBD-OS in the approved indications has been established from 4 placebo-controlled 
studies in patients with LGS and DS, and 1 placebo-controlled study in patients with TSC, and their 
associated long-term OLE studies. To date, no new important safety concerns have arisen from an 
estimated 38,200 patient-years of post-marketing experience with CBD-OS according to MAH. 
In the placebo-controlled studies in LGS and DS, concomitant CLB treatment was associated with an 
overall increased safety risk. Table 5-1 shows that there were consistently higher frequencies of AEs, 
SAEs at both the 10 and 20 mg/kg/day dosages, and AEs leading to discontinuation at the 20 mg/kg/day 
dosage, among patients treated with CLB compared to patients treated without CLB. 
The increased safety risk in patients treated with CBD-OS with CLB compared to treatment without CLB 
was primarily driven by the increased frequency of important risks relating to somnolence/sedation, 
pneumonia, and rash. Approximately half of the patients treated with CBD-OS with CLB experienced 
clinically significant somnolence, fatigue, lethargy, and sedation regardless of whether CBD-OS was 
administered as 10 or 20 mg/kg/day. CBD-OS treatment with CLB was also associated with higher 
incidences of pneumonia, rash, aggression, and irritability (Table 5-2).

In particular, regarding the grouped AESI terms for pneumonia: 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
No new safety information was submitted by the MAH.  
The main safety issues with CBD-OS in the recommended dose range of 10 to 25 mg/kg/day are 
hepatotoxicity and effects on the CNS such as increase in seizures (including paradoxical increase with 20 
mg/kg/day dose), somnolence, sedation, lethargy, fatigue, irritability and aggression. Other safety issues 
include infections, decreased appetite, weight decrease, diarrhoea, pyrexia, vomiting.

The safety profile, including the side effects linked to the CLB treatment, is known and the treating 
physicians are informed and experienced about handling these issues. In the absence of established 
efficacy profile, a known and manageable safety profile cannot be decisive on change of indication 
In view of the increased risk of pneumonia observed in the pivotal trials, the CHMP agreed to amend the 
SmPC sections 4.8 in order to better inform the prescribers.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In line with the original MAA, CBD-OS use with CLB has a known safety profile. 
In view of the increased risk of pneumonia, the CHMP agreed with the update of the Product Information. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
Following the CHMP position that the proposed extension of indication was not approvable, the RMP 
version 3.0, with minor editorial updates, was agreed. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of the extension of indication assessment and following the CHMP opinion that the positive B/R 
risk  of  CBD-OS  without  CLB  is  not  statistically  and  conclusively  demonstrated,  the  Epidyolex  indication 
remains unchanged.  
Nevertheless, the CHMP considered appropriate an update of Section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to provide 
further details regarding the increased risk of pneumonia. 
In addition, the outcome of the P46 011.1 procedure, as concluded in January 2023, was reflected in the 
section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
No new non-clinical, clinical efficacy or safety data were submitted to support the proposed extension of 
indication, with the use of CBD-OS as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with LGS or DS without 
the restriction of concomitant CLB.

The MAH referred to sections of data, previously generated and reviewed by the CHMP in the original 
MAA, in patients treated without CLB in the LGS and DS pivotal studies. The MAH also referred to the TSC 
data (study GWEP1521). A cross-study comparison of fenfluramine and CBD-OS without CLB in LGS was 
also provided during the procedure. The MAH argued that CBD-OS independent efficacy for broad 
spectrum symptomatic seizure reductions are established in TSC Study GWEP1521, that the safety profile 
of CBD-OS without CLB is favourable and that there is a need for expert physicians to select the most 
appropriate course of treatment for their patients. 
Whereas the clinical relevance of any seizure reduction in LGS/DS are acknowledged, all analyses 
provided in this application are exploratory in nature and consist of data previously evaluated by CHMP.  
There is no conclusive clinically relevant effect observed with CBD-OD treatment without CLB in the 
individual pivotal trials for LGS and DS. Neither the primary analysis nor the responder analysis is 
considered reliable or robust in terms of clinical relevance (which are already statistically not significant). 
Post hoc analyses without predefinition are not considered as an adequate approach to generate robust 
and reliable results. Furthermore, pooled analyses conducted across studies with different study 
populations, indications, study design and different doses cannot serve relevant proof of intended effect 
as well.  
The data generated for the TSC indication cannot be extrapolated to the LGS/DS indications (different 
population with different primary efficacy measures (i.e., focal motor seizures in TSC versus drop seizures 
in LGS and convulsive seizures in DS). 
Uncertainties about the effect size and clinical relevance for CBD-OS treatment without CLB in LGS and 
DS indications remain unchanged. The safety profile of CBD treatment in conjunction with CLB is known 
to the treating physician and manageable with precautions or discontinuation in certain cases (including 
the risk of paradoxical increase in seizures with titration to 20 mg/kg/day dose in LGS patients without 
CLB treatment).  
Consequently, in the absence of any new clinical data, the previous review and opinion of the CHMP, 
including the Scientific Advisory Group expert consultation, in the context of the original MAA, is 
maintained.  
No new data were provided and there is currently insufficient robust data of CBD-OS without concomitant 
CLB treatment in LGS and DS indications to support the proposed extension of indication. As reviewed 
and concluded in the original MAA, the overall B/R of Epidyolex remains positive for the indication 
‘adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) 
in conjunction with clobazam, for patients 2 years of age and older’. 
Therefore, based on the assessment of the data contained in the application, the CHMP is of the view that 
the proposed extension of indication submitted under category C.1.6 of the variation classification 
Guideline could not be supported. Instead, the data submitted support changes regarding the adverse 
event pneumonia (SmPC section 4.8).These changes fall under category C.1.4 of the variation 
classification Guideline.  
In reply to the 3rd Request for Supplementary Information, the MAH updated the product information 
accordingly.  
3.1.  Conclusions 
Based on the assessment of the data contained in this application, the CHMP agrees that whilst the 
proposed extension of indication, with the use of CBD-OS as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated 
Assessment report

with LGS or DS without the restriction of concomitant CLB, cannot be supported, the data submitted 
support changes regarding the adverse event pneumonia (SmPC section 4.8). 
The overall B/R of Epidyolex remains positive for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with clobazam, for patients 2 
years of age and older.

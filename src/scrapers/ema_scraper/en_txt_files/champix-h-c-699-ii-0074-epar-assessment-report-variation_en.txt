Dose-Ranging Study With Follow-Up, Evaluating The Safety And Efficacy Of Varenicline For Smoking 
Cessation In Healthy Adolescent Smokers." The PL is updated accordingly. RMP version 11.0 was 
submitted. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The MAH presents data from Study A3051073 a study of varenicline in adolescents age 12-19, designed 
and conducted to satisfy the post-marketing requirement for CHAMPIX under PAM (MEA 047), as well as 
data from two phase 1 studies of varenicline in this age group. Proposed CHAMPIX labelling revisions 
based on Study A3051073 updating relevant sections of the SmPC (Sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2) and 
Package Leaflet, as recommended in the Article 46 Assessment Report, are being provided as part of this 
Type II variation. 
A3051073 was designed with 3 study groups (2 active-treatment arms and one placebo arm) of a 100 
study subjects per group, from postulated CAR rates week 9-12 (primary endpoint) of 24% for varenicline 
and of 9% for placebo. This turned out to be an unrealistically low expected placebo response rate, as the 
study resulted in a placebo response rate that is twice as high as was projected with in the study power 
calculation. The analysis of efficacy results showed no significant treatment effect of varenicline, but the 
efficacy results for varenicline to adolescent smokers are difficult to interpret with certainty, as it must be 
suspected that the MAH’s rejection of vareniclines efficacy in adolescent smokers could be due to a Type 
II error.                       
The safety results showed that varenicline is generally well tolerated in adolescents. The pattern of 
adverse events in A3051073 was similar to the adverse events profile of varenicline in adults.                    
There are no signals indicating new safety concerns arising from study A3051073, or from the two Phase 
1 adolescent studies. This includes neuropsychiatric adverse events, which could conceivably be of special 
concern in an immature study population.  
Based on A3051073’s efficacy outcomes, the benefits of varenicline treatment in adolescents of 12-17 
years of age has not been demonstrated to outweigh the risks.

5.  Introduction 
This Type II Variation being submitted to update the CHAMPIX Product Information (Summary of Product 
Characteristics [SmPC] Sections 4.2, 5.1, and 5.2 and the Package Leaflet) with the results from Study 
A3051073, A Phase 4 Twelve-Week, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, 
Dose-Ranging Study With Follow-Up, Evaluating The Safety And Efficacy Of Varenicline For Smoking 
Cessation In Healthy Adolescent Smokers. 
Study A3051073 was a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) and a regulatory Post-Authorisation 
Measure (MEA 047) in the European Union (EU). The A3051073 Clinical Study Report (CSR) was initially 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 9 July 2018 in accordance with Article 46 of the 
Paediatric Regulation (European Commission) No. 1901/2006). The study was part of a Written Request 
for paediatric studies for CHANTIX issued by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
and a post-marketing study requirement for CHANTIX under the US Pediatric Research Equity Act. 
Product Development Rationale 
Smoking Cessation in Adolescents 
Adolescent smoking continues to be a public health concern despite the decline in smoking rates over the 
past decade. In the US, data from the Centres for Disease Control’s (CDC)2017 National Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey showed that 8.8% of students were current cigarette users (i.e., had smoked cigarettes 
on at least one of the 30 days preceding the survey), 2.6% were current frequent cigarette users (ie, had 
smoked ≥cigarettes on 20 of the 30 days preceding the survey) and 2.0% were current daily cigarette 
users (i.e., had smoked every day during the 30 days preceding the survey). According to the 2013 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health, five adolescents (12–17 years) accounted for half of the 
approximately 5,700 people per day who started smoking cigarettes. 
From a global perspective, a recent CDC assessment of data from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey 
(GYTS) (school-based survey among students 13 to 15 years old) for 2012-2015 showed that across 61 
countries, the median current tobacco smoking prevalence was 10.7% with 14.6% among males and 
7.5% among females.6 Another recent analysis of data from the GYTS including a broader time frame 
(2000-2015) and more countries (154) showed current any tobacco use was 15.7% overall with higher 
rates in males than females (20.2% versus [vs] 10.4%, respectively). 
Studies have shown that many adolescent smokers want to quit. In a 2015 CDC survey, among students 
who reported current cigarette use, 45.4% had tried to quit smoking during the 12 months preceding the 
survey. Other studies have reported over 50% of current adolescent smokers had intentions to quit and 
over 50% made quit attempts.6,7,9 Many, if not most, of these quit attempts are not successful.10,11 It 
is now accepted that addiction to smoking routine, making unassisted quitting difficult even among those 
without a long smoking history. 
As noted in two recent reviews on smoking cessation treatments in adolescents, there is a paucity of 
quality studies on the effectiveness of smoking cessation treatments in adolescent smokers, particularly 
regarding the use of pharmacotherapies. The limited data that are available suggest that treatments 
proven efficacious in adult smokers are not necessarily efficacious in adolescents. The Cochrane review3 
analysed four controlled pharmacotherapy studies that evaluated nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) 
and/or bupropion and met their quality criteria. These studies evaluated the use of nicotine patch, 
nicotine patch vs nicotine gum, bupropion, and nicotine patch plus bupropion vs nicotine patch alone. All 
four studies also included some form of patient counselling. The outcome measure was cessation rates at 
the 6-month or later follow-up point and none of the pharmacotherapies showed statistically significant 
treatment effects. Of note, in the bupropion versus placebo study a significant treatment effect for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 6/73 
 
 
 
bupropion 300 mg was reported at 6 weeks (end of treatment) but it was not maintained at 26 weeks. In 
addition, new evaluation of the study data showed that adherence to treatment strongly predicted 
successful cessation. The Towns review included 10 studies that evaluated the use of NRT or bupropion in 
adolescent smokers (some overlapping with those reported in the Cochrane review), 7 of which included 
a comparator and 3 of which were single arm studies. It was noted that no additional benefit of active 
treatment was found in 5 out of 7 comparison group studies. Two of the 3 single arm studies reported a 
5% quit rate with nicotine patches, and the third, a small study (n=16) in adolescent smokers with 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, reported a 31% quit rate after 4 weeks of bupropion. 
Adolescents face added difficulties in achieving successful cessation compared to adults even when they 
are motivated to quit, and these difficulties could help explain the lack of treatment effect in adolescents 
of smoking treatments with proven efficacy in adults. 
Adolescence is a developmental stage characterized by rapid neurocognitive and hormonal change. 
Differences in smoking patterns, lifestyle and attitudes towards seeking help in adolescents compared to 
adults may influence treatment effectiveness. Additionally, factors such as peer pressure, impulsivity and 
willingness to engage in risky behaviours, which are characteristic of that developmental stage, play a 
role in the initiation of smoking and are likely to have a negative impact on cessation attempts. 
Varenicline Background 
Varenicline was approved, as an aid to smoking cessation treatment for adults by the US FDA in May 2006 
under the trade name of CHANTIX and by the EMA in September 2006, under the trade name CHAMPIX. 
As of 07 February 2018, the data cut-off date for this submission, varenicline had received marketing 
authorization in 116 countries and was marketed in 94 countries. 
Varenicline, a highly selective partial agonist at the α4β2-subtype neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 
(nAChR), was specifically developed as an aid to smoking cessation. 
Data suggest that it is the α4β2 nAChR that mediates the dependence-producing effects of nicotine. The 
hypothesis underlying the efficacy of varenicline is that, as a partial agonist, varenicline blocks the 
behaviourally reinforcing effects of exogenous nicotine while also reducing the craving (or the urge to 
smoke) and withdrawal associated with smoking cessation. 
Results of the varenicline Phase 2-3 clinical trial program, which supported the initial approval, showed 
that varenicline is highly efficacious for smoking cessation compared with placebo and is well tolerated. 
Two identical double blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 pivotal studies additionally demonstrated that 
varenicline is more effective than bupropion (Zyban) for smoking cessation. In these two studies 
combined, the continuous abstinence rate (CAR) for Weeks 9-12 was 44.2% for varenicline, 29.7% for 
Zyban and 17.7% for placebo. 
The odds ratio (OR) for varenicline vs placebo was 3.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.88, 4.72) with 
a p-value of <0.0001 and the OR for varenicline vs bupropion was 1.87 (95% CI: 1.50, 2.34) with a 
p-value of <0.0001 (original SCE, Section 2.7.3.3.2.1.1). 
The pre-approval studies were conducted in adult smokers (18 years and older) who were otherwise 
generally healthy. Subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled smoking cessation studies in adult 
subjects with co-morbidities including stable cardiovascular disease, mild to moderate chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, major depressive disorder under stable treatment or successfully treated within the 
previous 2 years, a small study in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and a large 
study in subjects without and with a history of psychiatric disorders, have demonstrated that varenicline 
is efficacious and generally well-tolerated in these targeted populations as well. Other post-approval 
studies in adult smokers have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of varenicline in subjects previously 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 7/73 
 
 
 
treated with varenicline who failed to quit smoking or quit but relapsed, subjects who were given an 
option to choose a target-quit-date (TQD) between days 8 and 35 of treatment, and subjects who were 
not able or willing to quit within a month but were willing to reduce their smoking with the goal of reaching 
complete abstinence by week 12 and then continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 
weeks of treatment. 
The approved dosing regimen for adults (≥18 years old) is 1 mg twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks starting 
with a 1-week up-titration at the beginning of treatment. In patients who have stopped smoking, an 
additional 12 weeks of treatment is recommended to further increase the likelihood of maintaining 
long-term abstinence. Prescribing instructions recommend that the patient should determine a date to 
stop smoking, and varenicline dosing should begin 1 week before that date. Alternatively, patients can 
start treatment and then choose a quit date between days 8 and 35 of treatment. Patients who are not 
able or willing to quit abruptly can start treatment with varenicline and reduce their smoking with the goal 
of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks and then continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks for 
a total of 24 weeks of treatment. 
Varenicline Adolescent Program 
The varenicline adolescent program consists of three studies, a Phase 1 single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and safety/tolerability study, A3051029, a Phase 1 multiple-dose PK and safety/tolerability study, 
A3051070, and a Phase 4 efficacy/safety study, A3051073. The studies are summarised in Table 1. All 
three studies contributed PK and safety data; Study A3051073 was the only study that evaluated efficacy.

Table 1 Description of Varenicline Adolescent Studies Completed as of 7 February 2018 
Study A3051029 was conducted early in the varenicline clinical development program and the results 
were submitted with the original Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Study A3051070 was completed after the initial application and a Type II Variation, 
EMEA/H/C/000699/II-039, was submitted on 15 December 2011 (eCTD 0115) to update the product 
information with the results from the study. Additionally, the SCP that was included in the CHAMPIX 
Marketing Authorisation Renewal submitted on 18 December 2015 (eCTD 0180), also included a 
summary of the data from Study A3051070. 
Study A3051073 is a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) and a regulatory commitment in the 
European Union for varenicline (CHAMPIX). As noted above, the A3051073 CSR was initially submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 9 July 2018 in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric 
Regulation (European Commission [EC]) No. 1901/2006).

The formulation of varenicline used in Studies A3051073 and A3051070 was the clinical image of the 
immediate release commercial formulation and the formulation used in Study A3051029 was the Phase 3 
tartrate tablet formulation. These formulations are bioequivalent. 
Studies A3051073 and A3051029 used 0.5 mg varenicline tablets and Study A3051070 used 0.5 mg and 
1 mg varenicline tablets (SCP Appendix 1). 
The varenicline doses evaluated in Study A3051029 were selected based on safety and tolerability in 
Phase 1 adult studies and the observed trend for higher systemic exposure to varenicline in female adult 
smokers, who tended to have lower bodyweights relative to males. Because smaller individuals were 
expected in the adolescent population and lower body weight was associated with decreased tolerability, 
the study evaluated 0.5 mg and 1 mg as single oral doses. 
Varenicline doses evaluated in Study A3051070, in accordance with the WR, did not exceed 1 mg BID and 
included the recommended adult dose of 1 mg BID and a lower dose of 0.5 mg BID. Based on PK data 
from study A3051029 and adult population PK analyses, low body weight subjects (≤55 kg) received half 
the dose of high body weight subjects (>55 kg).  
The doses evaluated in Study A3051073 were based on the results of Study A3051070, as well as 
A3051029 and adult data. Because Study A3051070 demonstrated that varenicline exposure was 
adequately adjusted by halving the total daily dose of varenicline in subjects weighing ≤55 kg, subjects 
in A3051073 weighing ≤55 kg also had their randomised dose reduced by half; those randomised to 1 mg 
BID received 0.5 mg BID and those randomized to 0.5 mg BID received 0.5 mg once daily (QD). This 
dosing regimen was expected to provide exposure levels of varenicline in adolescent smokers that would 
be efficacious and tolerable, based on available adult data. 
All studies were conducted as per International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) standards. 
6.  Clinical Pharmacology 
The varenicline paediatric program included the following three clinical varenicline studies in adolescent 
subjects:  
•  A3051029, Phase 1, Randomized, Sponsor-Open, Investigator and Subject-Blind, Parallel-Group, 
Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability 
of Varenicline in Healthy Adolescent Smokers; 
•  A3051070, Phase 1, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Varenicline in Healthy Adolescent 
Smokers; and  
•  A3051073, A Twelve-Week, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, 
Dose-Ranging Study with Follow-Up Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Varenicline for Smoking 
Cessation in Healthy Adolescent Smokers. 
The Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies (SCP) for varenicline (CP 526,555) submitted with the 
initial Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) in adults included a comprehensive evaluation of 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of varenicline in healthy adult subjects who were 
smokers and non-smokers and also included Study A3051029 in adolescent subjects [original SCP].   
Since the initial submission, a Type II Variation EMEA/H/C/000699/II-039 to update the product 
information with the results from clinical study A3051070 was submitted on 15Dec2011 (eCTD 0115).  In 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 10/73 
 
 
 
 
addition, the renewal SCP that was included in the MA Renewal, submitted on 18Dec2015 (eCTD 0180) 
also included a summary of the data from submitted seven additional studies, including Study A3051070 
in adolescent subjects [renewal SCP].   
For the convenience of reviewers, this SCP provides PK and PD information from all three varenicline 
studies in adolescent subjects, including Study A3051029, and Study A3051070 and A3051073.  The new 
information in this Type II Variation submission is the population PK and exposure response (ER) analyses 
of varenicline in adolescent smokers including data from Study A3051073. The results of the three 
paediatric studies are generally consistent with those of previous studies in adults, and support the 
following conclusions: 
•  Varenicline in adolescent subjects exhibits linear PK following single or multiple dosing in 
adolescent smokers.  In adolescent smokers, systemic exposure and renal clearance were 
comparable with those of an adult population.  The median time to reach maximum 
concentrations (Tmax) following a single dose is approximately 3-4 hours, the elimination half-life 
is 10.9 hours, and steady state is reached within ~4 days of repeat dosing.  
•  A population PK analysis in adolescent smokers showed that varenicline PK was adequately 
characterised by a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination.  
Apparent clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) were estimated to be 12.5 L/hr and 
231 L, respectively for the reference adolescent subject: a 70 kg, white male.  CL/F and V/F 
increased with increasing body weight, consistent with the known allometric scaling in pediatrics.  
Varenicline PK in adolescent smokers, systemic exposure and oral clearance were generally 
comparable with those of an adult population.  
• 
• 
• 
In Study A3051073, the observed range of varenicline exposure was consistent with that 
expected for each dose and body weight group from the results obtained in the single and 
multiple dose adolescent PK studies, supporting that varenicline dose and administration were 
appropriate. 
In Study A3051073, the Week 9-12 continuous abstinence rate (CAR) did not increase with 
increasing varenicline systemic exposure [ie, Area Under the Concentration-time Curve from 
0-24 hours at Steady-State (AUC24)], supporting the negative findings for the primary endpoint 
from the overall study.  
In Study A3051073, nausea/vomiting incidence increased with increasing varenicline exposure; 
there was a statistically significant trend as a linear function of increasing AUC24 (p-value 
<0.001).  In addition, the probability of nausea/vomiting incidence increased in females relative 
to males.  The results were consistent with that observed in adult smokers. 
Background and Overview 
Varenicline is a selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) partial agonist designed to have specific 
and potent binding at the α4β2 receptor subtype, which mediates the behaviour reinforcing effects of 
nicotine while simultaneously preventing nicotine binding to these receptors.  Because of its mixed 
agonist-antagonist properties, varenicline offers the therapeutic benefit of relieving symptoms of nicotine 
withdrawal and cigarette craving during abstinence while blocking the reinforcing effects of chronic 
nicotine.  The approved varenicline dosing regimen for adults is 1 mg twice a day (BID) for 12 Weeks 
starting with a 1-week titration at the beginning of treatment. 
These PK and PD of varenicline in adults, submitted with the initial MAA, are briefly summarised below for 
the convenience of the reviewer: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 11/73 
 
 
 
•  Orally administered varenicline is virtually completely absorbed and is highly available 
systemically.  Oral bioavailability is unaffected by food or time-of-day dosing. 
•  Varenicline exhibits linear PK following single or multiple dosing.  The median Tmax following a 
single dose is ~3 hr, the elimination half-life is ~24 hr, and steady state is reached within ~4 days 
of repeat dosing. 
• 
Protein binding of varenicline is low (≤20%) and independent of age and renal function. 
•  Varenicline is almost exclusively excreted unchanged in the urine (92%), primarily via glomerular 
filtration, with an additional component of active secretion via the human organic cation transport 
system.  Varenicline does not undergo significant hepatic metabolism. 
•  Varenicline PK is unaffected by mild renal impairment.  Systemic exposure (AUC) of varenicline 
increased 1.5-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment and 2.1-fold in subjects with 
severe renal impairment.  
•  Varenicline PK is independent of race and sex, and is not changed in the elderly.  
•  No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions were observed when varenicline was 
co-administered with the narrow therapeutic index drugs digoxin or warfarin, the smoking 
cessation therapies bupropion (Zyban), nicotine replacement therapy, or the renally secreted 
drugs cimetidine or metformin. 
• 
• 
In a population PK analysis conducted on pooled data from 1878 adult smokers, renal function 
(on systemic clearance) and body weight (on volume of distribution) were important factors 
contributing to inter individual variability in the PK of varenicline. 
In ER analyses involving ~2,000 adult smokers from 5 Phase 2/3 Studies, logistic regression 
results showed that the end-of-treatment abstinence rate increased as a linear function of 
increasing varenicline exposure at steady-state (AUC24), from 38% at 0.5 mg BID to 56% at 1 
mg BID (vs. 22% for placebo).  Baseline smoking status and age were predictive of smoking 
cessation, whereas race and sex showed little or no influence.  Nausea/ vomiting incidence was 
sex-related (approximately 2-fold higher in females than males) and increased with varenicline 
exposure; at a dosage of 1 mg BID vs placebo, the predicted probability of nausea was 24 % vs. 
7 % in male subjects and 40 % vs. 14 % in female subjects. 
For varenicline Phase 1 studies in adolescent subjects, varenicline plasma concentration-time data were 
analysed by standard non-compartmental analysis (NCA) for A3051029 CSR and by a population PK 
analysis approach using nonlinear mixed effects modelling methodology for A3051070 CSR.   
In this SCP, the population PK analysis was conducted using nonlinear mixed effects modelling 
methodology for combined varenicline concentration-time data from all three clinical studies in 
adolescent subjects (A3051029, A3051070, and A3051073).  The ER analyses were conducted using a 
logistic regression model for data from Study A3051073.   
Further details of population PK and ER analyses are provided in a separate report in Module 5 
(PMAR-EQDD-A305-Other-502).  
All plasma and urine samples in adolescent subjects were assayed for varenicline concentrations at 
Intertek (formerly Alta Analytical Laboratory, San Diego, CA, United States [US]) using validated 
analytical assays in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures.  Bioanalytical reports for each 
of the studies can be found in the individual CSRs (A3051029 CSR, A3051070 CSR, and A3051073 CSR).

Pharmacokinetic Assessments in Single-Dose Study (A3051029) 
Study A3051029.  Phase 1, Randomized, Sponsor-Open, Investigator- and Subject-Blind, Parallel-Group, 
Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of 
Varenicline in Healthy Adolescent Smokers. 
Dates of Conduct: 16 September 2004 to 05 December 2004 
This study evaluated the PK, safety, and tolerability of single doses of 0.5 mg and 1 mg varenicline in 27 
adolescent smokers (12-17 years of age, 14 male and 13 female). Exposure, as assessed by area under 
the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf) and maximum concentration (Cmax), was 
approximately dose proportional between the 0.5 mg and 1 mg doses in adolescents. Mean plasma peak 
concentrations occurred within 3-4 hours after single-dose oral administration. Renal clearance of 
varenicline in the adolescent population using 48-hour urinary excretion data were 116 mL/min and 
103 mL/min following administration of single oral dose of 0.5 mg and 1 mg, respectively. The mean 
elimination half-life was 10.9 hours for both doses of varenicline.

Pharmacokinetic Assessments in Multiple-Dose Study (A3051070) 
Study A3051070. Phase 1, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Varenicline in Healthy Adolescent Smokers 
Dates of Conduct: 23 May 2007 to 01 December 2007. 
This study evaluated the multiple-dose PK, safety, and tolerability of varenicline in 72 healthy adolescent 
smokers aged 12 to 16 years, in which 57 subjects received varenicline. Subjects were enrolled into a low 
body weight (LBW) group (N = 29; 10 males and 19 females) and a high body weight (HBW) group 
(N = 28; 19 males and 9 females), defined as body weight (BWT) 30 to 55 kg and >55 kg, respectively. 
Subjects in each BWT group were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of two dosing regimens of varenicline 
or placebo for a treatment duration of 14 days. The varenicline doses were 0.5 mg QD or 0.5 mg BID in 
the LBW group and 0.5 mg BID or 1 mg BID in the HBW group.  Dosing was titrated over 7 days for the 
0.5 mg BID and 1 mg BID treatment groups (0.5 mg QD for 7 days for the former and 0.5 mg QD for 
3 days, followed by 0.5 mg BID for 4 days for the latter). All doses were administered with food. 
Sparse blood sampling for measurement of varenicline concentrations was included on Days 1, 8 and 14, 
as well as a single sample within 48 to 84 hours after the last dose of study drug, and a population PK 
approach was used to characterise the multiple-dose PK of varenicline in this adolescent population 
(A3051070 CSR Appendix 14). A 1-compartment model defined in terms of CL/F and V/F and a first-order 
absorption rate constant (ka) was used to fit the data; CL/F and V/F estimates (95% CIs) for a typical 
70-kg subject were 10.4 L/hr (9.2-11.5) and 215 L (204-238), respectively.  Body weight described a 
large fraction of the total observed inter individual variability in V/F (64.3%), but had less influence on 
inter individual variability of CL/F (18.9%). The estimated covariate effects of BWT on CL/F and V/F were 
in good agreement with allometric scaling laws of biology. Varenicline exposure increased in a 
dose-proportional manner after multiple doses of varenicline. Predicted steady-state median (range) 
exposures (AUC24) in adolescents weighing >55 kg (HBW) were 95.7 (49.0 - 189) ng∙hr/mL and 
197 (123 - 367) ng∙hr/mL for 0.5 mg BID and 1 mg BID, respectively. In adolescents of LBW, median 
exposures were 60.1 (44.4 - 102) ng∙hr/mL and 126 (80.7 - 179) ng∙hr/mL after administration of 
0.5 mg QD and 0.5 mg BID, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetic Characteristics  
In adolescent subjects, as in adults, Cmax and AUCinf increased in a dose-proportional manner after a 
single dose of varenicline. Doubling the dose from 0.5 to 1.0 mg increased mean Cmax and AUCinf by 
2.12- and 2.09-fold, respectively.  PK parameters and associated summary statistics for 0.5 mg and 1 mg 
single oral doses of varenicline in adolescents are compared with those obtained in adult subjects in 
Table 3.

Table 3 Comparison of Mean (SD) PK Parameters after Single Doses of Varenicline in 
Adolescent (A3051029) and Adult Smokers (A3051026) 
Varenicline systemic exposure in adolescents, as assessed by AUCinf, was comparable to that in adults. 
Higher plasma varenicline concentrations during the first 24 hours and a shorter elimination half-life were 
observed in adolescents compared with adults.  Since renal clearance was comparable between the 2 
doses, and consistent with that seen in an adult population (117.3 mL/min in Initial MAA, SCP Section 
2.7.2.3.1), the observed shorter half-life in adolescent subjects was likely due to decreased volume of 
distribution of varenicline in adolescents. 
Population Pharmacokinetic and Exposure-Response Analyses  
This section describes the pharmacometric analyses conducted to characterize the population 
pharmacokinetics of varenicline and to explore the relationships between varenicline systemic exposure 
and measures of efficacy and tolerability in adolescent smokers.  Detailed methods and results of these 
analyses are provided in a separate report in Module 5 (PMAR-EQDD-A305-Other-502). 
The population PK analysis included combined varenicline concentration-time data in adolescent smokers 
from a total of 3 clinical studies (two Phase 1 studies [A3051029 and A3051070] and one Phase 4 study 
[A3051073]).  The ER analyses used data from Study A3051073.   
Key findings of these analyses include: 
•  Varenicline PK in adolescent subjects was adequately characterised by a 1-compartment model 
with first-order absorption and first-order elimination.  
•  Apparent clearance and volume of distribution were estimated to be 12.5 L/hr and 231 L, 
respectively for the reference adolescent subject: a 70 kg, white male. 
•  Covariates that were included on varenicline CL/F were baseline body weight, sex, and race.  
Apparent clearance increased with increasing body weight.  In addition, CL/F decreased in 
females and the effects of race on CL/F were not significant. 
•  Covariates that were included on varenicline V/F were baseline body weight, sex, and race.  
Apparent volume of distribution increased with increasing body weight.  In addition, V/F 
decreased in females, subjects with black race, and subjects with other race. 
•  No varenicline ER relationship was demonstrated for the probability of Continuous Abstinence 
Rate (CAR) and Point Prevalence of Smoking Abstinence (PP) across the AUC24 range from study 
A3051073. 
•  A significant varenicline ER relationship was demonstrated for the probability of nausea/vomiting 
incidence across the AUC24 range from Study A3051073.  In addition, the probability of 
nausea/vomiting incidence increased by 86% in females relative to males.

Rationale for Dose Selection in Study A3051073 
Varenicline doses in Study A3051073 were selected based on the safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy data 
from the clinical trials in adult smokers and the safety, tolerability, and PK data from Studies A3051029 
and A3051070 in adolescent smokers. 
Study A3051073 was a Phase 4, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of two doses of varenicline (1 mg BID and 
0.5 mg BID) in nicotine-dependent adolescent smokers (12-19 years) in conjunction with age 
appropriate cessation counselling.  Since varenicline exposure was related to body weight in Phase 1 
studies, subjects with a body weight ≤55 kg had their varenicline dose reduced by half (those randomized 
to 1 mg BID received 0.5 mg BID and those randomized to 0.5 mg BID received 0.5 mg QD). The 
treatment period was 12 weeks, initiated with dose titration over the first two weeks, and subjects’ 
smoking status was followed for additional 40 weeks.   
Results of the varenicline Phase 2-3 clinical trial program, which supported the initial approval in adults, 
showed that varenicline is highly efficacious for smoking cessation compared with placebo and is well 
tolerated in smokers 18 years of age and older. Exposure-response information from 5 Phase 2/3 Studies 
further indicated that higher systemic exposure to varenicline was associated with greater probability of 
4-week smoking cessation. Since adolescents may have a different risk/benefit profile from adults, Study 
A3051073 investigated both 1 mg BID recommended in adults and a lower dose of varenicline (0.5 mg 
BID) compared with placebo in the adolescent smokers (Paediatric Written Request by the US Food and 
Drug Administration).  
In Study A3051029, varenicline exposure (AUCinf) was similar to that in adult smokers, and there was a 
trend for higher Cmax values and a shorter half-life, suggestive of a smaller volume of distribution 
(A3051029 CSR). Characterisation of the multiple-dose PK in adolescent smokers 12 to 16 years old in 
Study A3051070 confirmed these results; CL/F estimate in a typical subject weighing 70 kg was 10.4 
L/hr, similar to that in adults (10.4 L/hr), whereas the estimate of V/F (215 L) was lower than the 
estimate (337 L) in adults. Body weight was estimated to be an important predictor of the inter-individual 
variability in V/F, with less impact on CL/F. Predicted median steady-state AUC24 in adolescents weighing 
> 55 kg was consistent with that previously reported for adult smokers at an equivalent daily dose, and 
exposure was higher in adolescents of smaller body size. Adjusting the dose to half in adolescents 
weighing ≤ 55 kg in Study A3051070 resulted in predicted exposures at the lower end of the range 
expected in adults. 
Since Study A3051070 demonstrated that varenicline exposure was adequately adjusted by halving the 
total daily dose of varenicline in subjects weighing ≤55 kg, adolescent subjects weighing ≤55 kg in Study 
A3051073 also had their randomized dose reduced by half. Those randomized to 1 mg BID received 0.5 
mg BID and those randomized to 0.5 mg BID received 0.5 mg QD in Study A3051073. This dosing 
regimen was expected to provide efficacious and tolerable exposures of varenicline in adolescent smokers 
based on adult data.  
Completion of Study A3051073 provided no new information relevant to dosing recommendations in 
adolescent smokers given the negative efficacy results. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Subject Characteristics and Disposition: The studies and samples included in the population PK 
analysis are summarized in Table 4. A total of 1097 plasma varenicline concentrations from 218 subjects 
were used in the population PK analysis, including 284 concentrations from 139 subjects in Study 
A3051073.

Table 5 provides summary statistics of the baseline demographic covariates in the population PK analysis 
dataset.  Approximately 99% of adolescent subjects had normal renal function (CRCL >80 mL/min).  For 
the analysis, subjects who reported as Asian and other race were grouped together (defined as “other” for 
the analysis) since the densely sampled Phase 1 studies (i.e., A3051029 and A3051070) consisted of only 
1 subject with Asian race vs 18 subjects with other race.

Final Pharmacokinetic Model: An one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination 
adequately described the plasma concentration-time profile of varenicline in adolescent smokers. This 
model was parameterized in terms of CL/F, V/F and ka. 
For covariate testing, BWT, race, and sex were added on CL/F and V/F using the FME procedure. Since 
BWT and CRCL were correlated and most adolescents were expected to have normal renal function, CRCL 
was not included as a covariate on CL/F. Additionally, since BWT and age were correlated; age was not 
included as a covariate on CL/F and V/F.  Equations below describe the incorporation of covariate effects 
into the final model: 
Where θ represents fixed effect parameters, and Empirical Bayes prediction of the inter individual random 
effect (η) represents a subject-specific random effect.  The continuous covariate of baseline body weight 
was represented by BWT. Categorical covariates were categorised in order to create indicator variables 
that equal one if the relevant condition is true and zero otherwise. These indicator variables included 
female sex (where NSEX describes male=0 and female=1), black (RACE2), and other (RACE3).   
The parameter estimates for the final model are listed in Table 6.

varenicline were estimated to be 12.5 L/hr and 231 L, respectively. All fixed effect parameters were 
estimated with reasonable precision (relative standard error [RSE] was <25%). Inter-individual variance 
for CL/F, V/F, and ka (expressed as percent CV) was reduced from the base model (35%, 29%, and 47%, 
respectively) to the final model (32%, 13%, and 44%, respectively) with the inclusion of the covariate 
effects (i.e., BWT, race, and sex on both CL/F and V/F). Residual variability was lower in the Phase 1 
studies than the Phase 4 study.  This was expected, as measurement error of dosing information can 
often be larger in sparsely sampled out-patient studies with non-witnessed dosing relative to in-patient 
Phase 1 studies.  
Covariate effects on AUC24 relative to the reference adolescent subject are illustrated in Figure 2. AUC24 
increased with decreasing BWT. For example, subjects with a BWT of 60 kg and 50 kg would have 9% and 
21% greater exposure, respectively, relative to a reference adolescent subject with a BWT of 70 kg.  
Additionally, the effect of female sex on AUC24 was significant (based upon the confidence intervals [CIs] 
from the bootstrap), but the magnitude of the effect was relatively small (i.e., 18%). The effects of black 
race and other race on AUC24 were not significant (based upon the CIs from the bootstrap).   
In addition, the effects of BWT, black race, other race, and female sex were significant on V/F. Over the 
range of 46.6 to 89.8 kg (corresponding to the 5th and 95th percentiles of the observed weights), V/F 
increased from 162 to 287 L representing a <30% change relative to the reference subject weighing 70 
kg.  Black race, other race, and female sex were found to decrease V/F by approximately 24%, 15%, and 
14% relative to a white male, respectively.

Abbreviation: CI=Confidence Interval; The 95% CI of the ratio was generated from 1400 non-parametric bootstrapped 
sets of population parameter values using the final population PK model (where 50 runs with minimization terminated 
and 241 runs with estimates near a boundary were skipped when calculating the bootstrap results).  Solid squares 
represent the ratio of the typical predicted AUC24 relative to the reference adolescent subject of a white male weighing 
70 kg.  Thus, a value of one (1.0) represents unity or a null covariate effect.  The error bars represent the 95% CI of 
the ratio. 
One site in Study A3051073 was terminated due to concerns regarding International Conference on 
Harmonization Good Clinical Practice non-compliance. The impact of including the data of seven subjects 
from site 1097 was explored as a sensitivity analysis by re-estimating the final model that excluded the 
data from the subjects at site 1097. This was consistent with the A3051073 study statistical analysis plan, 
which provided for a sensitivity analysis related to the site 1097 data (A3051073 CSR). When these 
subjects were excluded, the changes in the key fixed parameters (i.e., CL/F or V/F) were less than 3% 
compared to the parameter estimates from the final model including these subjects. Therefore, the 
subjects from site 1097 were not determined to be influential and were retained in the analysis.

Exposure-Response Analyses  
Efficacy and tolerability data along with the covariate information were pooled together and merged with 
the individual varenicline AUC24 values predicted from the final population PK model and parameter 
estimates for Study A3051073. The daily AUC24 was obtained from the empirical Bayes’ predictions of 
each subject’s CL/F value and total daily dose. For subjects in the placebo group, AUC24 values were set 
to zero.   
The following endpoints were included for ER analyses: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The CAR from Week 9 through Week 12 was defined as the proportion of subjects who remained 
abstinent from Week 9 to Week 12 (confirmed by urine cotinine testing); 
The CAR from Week 9 through Week 52 was defined as the proportion of subjects who remained 
abstinent from Week 9 to Week 52 (confirmed by urine cotinine testing); 
The Weekly PP at Weeks 12 and 52 was defined as the proportion of subjects abstaining from 
smoking during the preceding 7 days; 
The reduction in number of cigarettes smoked at Weeks 12 and 52 was calculated at each visit by 
subtracting the reported average number of cigarettes smoked per day in the past 7 days at each 
visit from the average number of cigarettes smoked per day in the past 7 days reported at the 
baseline visit; 
The incidence of nausea/vomiting was defined as treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) that 
began on or after the first day of study medication and until the last dose of study medication. 
Each endpoint was a dichotomous categorical variable representing a successful quit (1 = yes, 0 = no) or 
the occurrence of an AE (nausea/vomiting). The ER data were viewed as a probabilistic outcome and 
analysed using a logistic regression model.  
The Weeks 9-12 CAR, Weeks 9-52 CAR, and nausea/vomiting incidence ER analysis data files consisted of 
238 observations from 238 subjects. The Week 12 7-day PP and Week 52 7-day PP ER analysis data files 
consisted of 185 and 158 observations from 185 and 158 subjects, respectively. Table 8 provides 
summary statistics of the baseline demographic covariates from the final ER analysis data file for Weeks 
9-12 CAR, Weeks 9-52 CAR, and nausea/vomiting incidence endpoints. For consistency with the 
population PK analysis, subjects with Asian and other race were grouped together for the ER analyses.

Similarly, there was no relationship between the other efficacy endpoints (Weeks 9-52 CAR, PP at Weeks 
12 and 52, and the reduction in number of cigarettes smoked at Weeks 12 and 52) and varenicline 
exposure, and thus no further model development was performed for these endpoints. In addition, a 
dose-response analysis was also explored for the Weeks 9-12 CAR endpoint. This allowed for an 
investigation of a potential trend when subjects without a reported AUC24 from the population PK analysis 
were included in the data file.  This dose-response analysis showed no statistically significant trend 
(p-value for slope estimate was 0.494), consistent with the ER analysis using AUC24.   
The results of the logistic regression analysis for nausea incidence are shown in Figure 4. The addition of 
varenicline steady-state exposure (AUC24) as a linear function resulted in an improved goodness of fit 
based on the objective function value and demonstrated a statistically significant trend (p-value for slope 
estimate was <0.001).

Further model development was performed including covariate testing. Covariate parameters including 
Fagerström score question 1 (FSQ1) ("How soon after you wake up do you smoke your first cigarette?"), 
age, sex, and race were added to the base intercept model with AUC24 as a linear function using the FME 
procedure and was considered a final model. The equation below describes the incorporation of covariate 
effects in the final model: 
Where θ represents fixed effect parameters and AGE is a continuous covariate.  Categorical covariates 
were categorised in order to create indicator variables that equal one if the relevant condition is true and 
zero otherwise. These indicator variables included time to first cigarette between 31-60 min [FSQ1(1)], 
time to first cigarette between 6-30 min [FSQ1(2)], time to first cigarette less than 5 min [FSQ1(3)], 
female sex (where NSEX describes male=0 and female=1), black (RACE2), and other (RACE3). The 
reference adolescent subject was defined as a 16-year-old white male that smokes their first cigarette 
greater than 60 minutes after waking up in the morning.

The final model showed that the nausea/vomiting incidence increased with increasing AUC24. For a 16 
year-old white male who smokes the first cigarette between 31-60 minutes after waking up in the 
morning, the probability of nausea/vomiting incidence increased to 13%, 17%, 28%, and 43% at a 
varenicline AUC24 of 50, 80, 150, and 225 ng*hr/mL, compared to 9% with placebo, respectively.

As shown in Figure 5, the covariate effects of age, FSQ1: first cigarette within 6-30 min, FSQ1: first 
cigarette<5 min, and race were not significant (based upon the CIs from the bootstrap and relative to the 
reference adolescent subject of a 16 year-old white male that smokes their first cigarette between 31-60 
minutes after waking up in the morning and has a varenicline steady state exposure of 153 ng*hr/mL). 
The probability of nausea/vomiting incidence was approximately zero for FSQ1: first cigarette >60 min 
(relative to the reference subject) as the number of subjects in this category was very small (five subjects 
as shown in Table 8). The point estimate and the bootstrapped 95% CIs for the sex effect on the 
probability relative to the reference subject demonstrated a significant increase of approximately 86% in 
nausea/vomiting incidence for female smokers.  This was consistent with that observed in adult smokers 
as nausea/vomiting incidence was approximately 2-fold higher in adult females than adult males.

MAH’s overall Summary and Conclusions on the Clinical Pharmacology 
The PK data of varenicline in adolescent smokers from Studies A3051029, A3051070, and A3051073 
showed generally consistent results with those of previous studies in adults. Varenicline exhibits linear 
PK, and systemic exposure and renal clearance were generally comparable with those of an adult 
population.  The population PK analysis showed that CL/F and V/F estimates of varenicline were 12.5 L/hr 
and 231 L, respectively for a reference 70-kg male adolescent smoker. The CL/F and V/F estimates in 
adolescent smokers were approximately 20% higher and 31% lower than the estimates in adults. 
Considering that 20% higher CL/F translates into ~17% lower AUC24, this difference is not considered 
clinically meaningful. Decreases in V/F would result in an increase in Cmax, but would not impact AUC24. As 
efficacy and safety of varenicline was driven by AUC in adult smokers, the changes in V/F are not 
considered clinically relevant. The half-life in adolescent smokers was shorter than ~24 hours in adults. 
Since the renal clearance was comparable between both 0.5 mg and 1 mg single doses in Study 
A3051029 and was consistent with that seen in an adult population, the more rapid decline in the plasma 
varenicline concentrations was a result of reduced V/F after oral administration of varenicline in 
adolescents. The reason for the observed difference in distribution properties between adolescents and 
adults is unclear, although it may be related to a different distribution pattern of lean tissue and fat mass. 
This difference is not considered significant, as the overall exposure was comparable to that in adults 
when dosed twice daily.  
Study A3051073 randomized adolescent smokers to the recommended adult dose of 1 mg BID and a 
lower dose of 0.5 mg BID, with each of these doses adjusted to half in subjects ≤55 kg. The observed 
range of exposure in Study A3051073 was consistent with that expected for each dose and body weight 
group from the results obtained in adolescent PK studies, supporting that varenicline dose and 
administration were appropriate in the study. In Study A3051073, the Week 9-12 CAR did not increase 
with increasing varenicline exposure as the logistic regression analyses for efficacy showed no significant 
relationship with AUC24, supporting the negative findings for the primary endpoint from the overall study. 
Nausea/vomiting incidence, however, increased linearly with increasing varenicline exposure; there was 
a statistically significant trend with the addition of AUC24 as a linear function (p-value <0.001). The 
nausea/vomiting might be attributed to its pharmacological activity on nAChRs at the central and 
peripheral levels.  The result was consistent with that observed for nausea/vomiting in adult smokers.  
In summary, the results from Studies A3051029, A3051070, and A3051073 support the following 
conclusions: 
•  Varenicline in adolescent subjects exhibits linear PK following single or multiple dosing in 
adolescent smokers. In adolescent smokers, systemic exposure and renal clearance were 
comparable with those of an adult population. The median time to reach maximum 
concentrations following a single dose is approximately 3-4 hours, the elimination half-life is 
10.9 hours, and steady state is reached within ~4 days of repeat dosing.  
•  A population PK analysis in adolescent smokers showed that varenicline PK was adequately 
characterised by a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination.  
Apparent clearance and volume of distribution were estimated to be 12.5 L/hr and 231 L, 
respectively for the reference adolescent subject: a 70 kg, white male. CL/F and V/F increased 
with increasing body weight, consistent with the known allometric scaling in paediatrics. 
Varenicline PK in adolescent smokers, systemic exposure and oral clearance were generally 
comparable with those of an adult population.   
• 
In Study A3051073, the observed range of varenicline exposure was consistent with that 
expected for each dose and body weight group from the results obtained in the single and 
Assessment report

multiple dose adolescent PK studies, supporting that varenicline dose and administration were 
appropriate.   
• 
• 
In Study A3051073, the Week 9-12 CAR did not increase with increasing varenicline systemic 
exposure [ie, AUC24], supporting the negative findings for the primary endpoint from the overall 
study.   
In Study A3051073, nausea/vomiting incidence increased with increasing varenicline exposure; 
there was a statistically significant trend as a linear function of increasing AUC24 (p-value 
<0.001).  In addition, the probability of nausea/vomiting incidence increased in females relative 
to males. The results were consistent with that observed in adult smokers. 
CHMP comments on the Clinical Pharmacology 
The MAH’s analysis of the pharmacokinetic data from the three presented studies support that varenicline 
dose and administration were appropriate in study A3051073.  
Varenicline in adolescent subjects exhibits linear PK following single or multiple dosing in adolescent 
smokers. Systemic exposure and renal clearance were comparable with those of an adult population. 
In adolescent smokers showed that varenicline PK was adequately characterized by a 1-compartment 
model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. Systemic exposure and oral clearance were 
generally comparable with those of an adult population.   
In Study A3051073, the Week 9-12 CAR did not increase with increasing varenicline systemic exposure. 
This suggests that adolescent smokers may respond differently to varenicline systemic exposure than 
adult smokers do, and the finding does to some extent lend support for the validity of the negative 
efficacy findings of the study.   
The AE’s nausea/vomiting incidence increased with increasing varenicline exposure, at a pattern that was 
consistent with what is observed in adults 
7.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
The efficacy of varenicline in adolescent smokers 12-19 years old was evaluated in Study A3051073. The 
information summarized in this section and in the accompanying SCE is focused on the study population 
overall and the subgroup of subjects 12-17 years old. Full information on these groups of subjects, as well 
as the 12-16 year old and 17-19 year old age strata, is provided in the A3051073 CSR. 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of Study A3051073 was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
varenicline compared with placebo in adolescent smokers 12 19 years old. 
Study design 
Study A3051073 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study, 
designed to compare 2 doses of varenicline with placebo for smoking cessation in nicotine-dependent 
adolescent smokers 12-19 years old who were motivated to quit. As noted above (Section 2.5.1.3), the 
two doses evaluated were 1.0 mg BID (high-dose) and 0.5 mg BID (low-dose). Doses were reduced by 
half for subjects who weighed ≤55 kg.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 29/73 
 
 
 
 
Randomisation was stratified by age (12-16 years old and 17-19 years old) and body weight (≤55 kg and 
>55 kg). Enrolment of 17-19 year olds was capped to ensure an adequate number of 12-16 year olds, the 
age group of primary interest in the US. The inclusion of 12-19 year olds allowed for the evaluation of a 
12-17 year old subgroup, the age group of primary interest in the EU. 
The treatment period was 12 weeks. Dosing began with a 2-week titration period with respective 
adjustments for the low-body weight subjects as described in the A3051073 Protocol Section 5.6. This 
longer titration (relative to the 1 week recommended in adults) was chosen to potentially minimise 
treatment-related side effects. All subjects were to set their TQD to coincide with the Week 1 visit. After 
the treatment period, there was a 40-week non-treatment follow-up period. 
An overview of the study design is shown in (Figure 6). Additional details are provided in the A3051073 
CSR Section 9.1.

Abbreviations: BID = twice daily; BL = baseline; kg = kilogram; TC = telephone contact. 
Study population  
As noted above, the study enrolled 12-19 year-old smokers (overall study population); the subset of 
subjects 12-17 years old was the population of interest to the EU. To participate in the study subjects 
were required to have been smoking an average of at least 5 cigarettes per day during the past 30 days, 
have a total score of 4 or higher on the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (adolescent version, 
FTND32), which is consistent with at least moderate dependence, be motivated to stop smoking and have 
made at least 1 prior serious quit attempt. Complete lists of inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided 
in A3051073 CSR Sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2, respectively. 
Initially, Study A3051073 was conducted at sites in the US only; however, due to enrolment difficulties, 
study sites were also opened outside of the US. In total, subjects were randomized at 57 sites in six 
countries: 34 in the US, 2 in Canada, 1 in the Republic of Georgia, 4 in the Republic of Korea, 10 in the 
Russian Federation, and 6 in Taiwan. While smoking prevalence rates differ by country, there is no reason 
to believe that ex-US adolescent subjects would have a different response to treatment than US 
adolescent subjects. 
In previous studies, varenicline has been shown to be efficacious in adults in these regions. Subject 
disposition for the overall study population and the 12-17 year olds is shown in Table 9.

In the overall study population, a total of 463 subjects were screened, of which 312 subjects were 
randomised to treatment. Among the 151 screen failures, 26 failed because they did not meet the 
inclusion criterion of a FTND score ≥4 and/or smoking five or more cigarettes per day and/or were 
motivated to stop smoking (CSR A3051073, Table 16.2.1.1.1). In total, 307 of the 312 randomized 
subjects received study drug. Completion of treatment (69.4% high-dose varenicline, 74.0% low-dose 
varenicline, 62.6% placebo) and completion of study rates (62.0%, 67.0%, 53.5%, respectively) were 
higher in the varenicline groups than placebo and were highest in the low-dose varenicline group. 
Among 12-17 year olds, 315 subjects were screened, of which 234 were randomised and 230 received 
study drug. Completion of treatment (75.9% high-dose varenicline, 82.9% lowdose varenicline, 62.7% 
placebo) and completion of study rates (74.7%, 76.3%, 54.7%, respectively) were higher in the 
varenicline groups than placebo and were highest in the low-dose varenicline group.

Table 10 
In the overall study population (Safety Population), baseline characteristics were balanced across 
treatment groups. The mean age was 15.9 years old, there were approximately twice as many males as 
females, and approximately 75% of the subjects were White. Subjects had been smoking for a mean of 
approximately 3 years and were smoking an average of approximately 12 cigarettes per day at screening. 
Approximately 75% of subjects had a FTND score of 4-6, which can be categorised as moderate 
dependence on the scale of 0-10. 
It is noteworthy that across all treatment groups over 90% of subjects reported having frequent contact 
with someone who smokes and approximately 75% reported living with someone who smokes, as these 
factors contribute to difficulty in achieving abstinence.

Among 12-17 year olds, baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups. In this age 
group, the mean age was 15.1 years old, approximately twice as many subjects were male as female, and 
approximately 70% of subjects were White. Subjects had been smoking for a mean of approximately 2.5 
years and were smoking an average of approximately 11 cigarettes per day. Approximately 80% of 
subjects had FTND scores of 4-6. Across all treatment groups, over 90% of subjects reported having 
frequent contact with someone who smokes and approximately 75% reported living with someone who 
smokes. 
7-Day Point Prevalence of Abstinence 
The 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence was assessed by the subject’s report of cigarette or 
other nicotine/tobacco use in the previous 7 days, using the NUI and confirmed by urine cotinine at clinic 
visits (note: urine cotinine was not tested at clinic visits from Week 3 through Week 8 or at any telephone 
visits [Weeks 24, 32, 40, and 48]). The 7-day point prevalence of abstinence was assessed weekly from 
Week 3 through Week 52. Subjects who did not smoke for the 7-day period being analyaed were 
considered responders. 
The 7-day point prevalence of abstinence at Weeks 12, 24 and 52 were secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Reduction in Number of Cigarettes Smoked 
The reduction in the number of the cigarettes smoked was calculated at each visit by subtracting the 
reported average number of cigarettes smoked per day in the past 7 days at each visit from the average 
number of cigarettes smoked per day in the past 7 days reported at the Baseline visit, as reported on the 
NUI. Weekly reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked was calculated from Week 1 through Week 52. 
Reduction in cigarettes smoked at Weeks 12, 24 and 52 were secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy analysis for the Study A3051073 was the comparison of varenicline to placebo for 
the CAR for Week 9 through Week 12 for the overall study population using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). 
All other analyses were considered secondary. An overview of the efficacy analyses is provided below, 
further details are provided in the A3051073 CSR, Section 9.7 and in the A3051073 Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP). 
Analysis Methods 
Efficacy analyses included descriptive statistics and model-based analyses. 
Analysis of smoking cessation endpoints, CAR and 7-day point prevalence, used a logistic regression 
model. The model included strata and pooled centre as independent variables. 
Treatment by centre, treatment by age stratum (as appropriate), and treatment by body weight stratum 
(as appropriate) were investigated. If interactions were significant in the model, then exploratory 
analyses were undertaken to explain the nature and source of the interaction. 
However, the reported p-values were based on the main effects model (CSR A3051073, Section 9.7.3.1). 
Statistical hypotheses for the primary endpoint were tested in an ordered fashion to preserve overall Type 
I Error. The high-dose varenicline group was tested against placebo, and if a statistically significant 
difference was observed, the low-dose varenicline group was tested against placebo. A p-value of ≤0.05 
was considered statistically significant in both tests. 
Both tests were presented regardless of the p-value obtained.

Subjects who discontinued the study were assumed to be smokers from the time point of discontinuation 
through the end of the study. In computing responder rates, subjects who discontinued the study were 
included in the denominator but not in the numerator, regardless of their last smoking status evaluation. 
Reduction in the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was analysed using longitudinal repeated 
measures models with terms as described above for CAR and 7-day point prevalence. In addition to 
treatment and visit, baseline number of cigarettes smoked, pooled study centre, age stratum, and body 
weight stratum were included as covariates. A treatment by visit interaction was included for estimation 
purposes. 
Analysis Populations 
Statistical analyses were performed on the following groups of subjects: 
•  Overall study (12-19 year olds); 
•  12-16 year old age stratum; 
•  12-16 year old age stratum, ≤55 kg weight stratum; 
•  12-16 year old age stratum, >55 kg weight stratum; 
•  17-19 year old age stratum (descriptive statistics only; enrolment for this stratum was capped 
and it was not powered to detect treatment differences); 
•  12-17 year old age group (post hoc analyses). 
The primary efficacy analysis population was the FAS, defined as all subjects who were randomised 
whether or not they received treatment. 
All efficacy analyses were also performed on the Completer Subjects population, which was defined as the 
subset of the FAS who had at least 80% treatment compliance, as measured by having any dose of study 
medication for 80% of the planned number of days in the trial treatment period. 
Several sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary endpoint including one to exclude data from 
site 1097, which was terminated based on concerns regarding GCP non-compliance; another to evaluate, 
using multiple imputation methods, the impact of missing data due to study discontinuation, and a third 
based on discontinuation from treatment, regardless of study completion status, also used multiple 
imputation methods to evaluate the impact of missing data. 
CHMP comments 
Study A3051073 was designed in agreement with, and with input from, the US FDA, and secondarily 
complies with EMA’s article 46 requirement of an assessment of the use of varenicline in 12-17-years old 
adolescents by added post hoc analyses.  
The clinical trial was designed with similar methodology as previously conducted varenicline trials in adult 
smokers. The choice of primary and secondary endpoints, and the trial design with 12-week treatment 
duration and a 40-week follow-up period, trial visits and telephone contacts can be endorsed. Some 
changes have been made from previous trial designs, to adjust to the different conditions in treating 
adolescent study subjects. The trial used a longer titration period to reduce potential side effects and thus 
ensure compliance; this approach can be endorsed. In order to correct varenicline exposure for 
differences in body weight among study subjects who were still undergoing growth, the subjects were 
stratified in a lighter than 55 kg group and a heavier than 55 kg group, where the heavier adolescents 
received adult dosing (both high and low dose group) and the lighter adolescents received half of an adult 
dose. This approach is justified.

The statistical methods are not described above, but it should be repeated from previous assessments 
that A3051073 was designed with 3 study groups (2 active-treatment arms and one placebo arm) of a 
100 study subjects per group, from postulated CAR rates week 9-12 (primary endpoint) of 24% for 
varenicline and of 9% for placebo. 
7.2.  Results 
Results of efficacy analyses are presented below for the FAS population overall and for the FAS 12-17 
year-old subgroup. Efficacy analyses for the 12-16 year-old age stratum are provided in the A3051073 
CSR, Section 11.4. Descriptive statistics for the 17-19 year old age stratum are also provided in the 
A3051073 CSR (see specifically A3051073 CSR Table 14.2.2.1.3, Table 14.2.2.2.3, Table 14.2.2.4.3, and 
Table 14.2.2.3.3.1). The study was not powered to detect treatment differences in the 17-19 year old 
stratum and therefore, no model-based analyses were performed and no efficacy conclusions can be 
made in this age group. Additionally, results for the Completer Subjects population and by weight strata 
in 12-16 year olds are provided in the A3051073 CSR, Section 11.4. 
Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of CAR Week 9 through Week 12 for the FAS population overall and FAS 12-17 year olds is 
shown in Table 11. 
Table 11 Treatment Comparison of Continuous Abstinence, Weeks 9-12, Confirmed by Urine 
Cotinine, Study A3051073, FAS Population Overall and 12-17 Year Olds  
In the FAS population overall, the observed CARs were 20.2% for high-dose varenicline subjects, 27.2% 
for low-dose varenicline subjects, and 18.0% for placebo subjects. Neither high-dose varenicline (OR 
1.18 [95% CI: 0.59 to 2.37], p=0.6337) nor low-dose varenicline (OR 1.73 [95% CI: 0.88 to 3.39], 
p=0.1114) were shown to be statistically significantly different from placebo. 
Among 12-17 year olds, the observed CARs were 18.8% for high-dose varenicline subjects, 32.1% for 
low-dose varenicline subjects, and 17.1% for placebo subjects. High-dose varenicline was shown not to 
be statistically significantly different compared with placebo (OR 1.13 [95% CI: 0.50, 2.56], p=0.7753). 
For low-dose varenicline compared with placebo, the OR was 2.28 (95% CI: 1.06 to 4.89), p=0.0347. 
Given the pre-specified statistical decision rules and the lack of statistical significance for the high-dose 
varenicline group, this result was considered nominal and not statistically significant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019

None of the Completer Subjects analyses and none of the sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint 
demonstrated statistically significant differences between either dose of varenicline and placebo either in 
the overall study population or in the 12-17 year-old subgroup, supporting the negative findings of the 
primary analysis. 
Secondary Endpoints 
7-Day Point Prevalence of Abstinence 
In the FAS population overall, at each weekly assessment, a greater percentage of subjects treated with 
high- or low-dose varenicline reported being abstinent for 7-days than subjects treated with placebo. 
Over the 12-week treatment period, the 7-day-point prevalence of abstinence rates generally increased, 
although the highest percentage of high-dose varenicline subjects was at Week 8. After the 12-week 
treatment phase, 7-day-point prevalence of abstinence rates generally declined over the post-treatment 
period, to a lesser extent for both varenicline groups than for placebo. 
Among 12-17 year olds, at each weekly assessment a greater percentage of subjects treated with high- 
or low-dose varenicline reported being abstinent for 7-days than subjects treated with placebo. Over the 
12-week treatment period, the 7-day-point prevalence of abstinence rates generally increased, although 
the highest percentage of high-dose varenicline subjects was at Week 8. After the 12-week treatment 
phase, 7-day-point prevalence of abstinence rates generally declined over the follow-up period for the 
placebo group but not for either varenicline group. 
Table 12 summarises the analysis of 7-day point prevalence at Weeks 12, 24 and 52.

In the FAS population overall, none of the ORs were statistically significant at Weeks 12, 24 and 52 for the 
comparisons between high-dose varenicline and placebo or between low-dose varenicline and placebo. 
Among 12-17 year olds, none of the OR’s were statistically significant at Weeks 12, 24 and 52, for the 
comparisons between high-dose varenicline and placebo or between low-dose varenicline and placebo; 
although for Week 52 there was a nominal p-value of 0.0323 for the comparison of low-dose varenicline 
and placebo. 
Reduction from Baseline in Daily Number of Cigarettes Smoked 
The weekly reduction in number of cigarettes smoked relative to Baseline in the FAS population overall 
and in 12-17 year olds is provided in A3051073 CSR Table 14.2.2.3.1.1 and Table 14.2.2.3.3.1.a, 
respectively. 
In the FAS population overall, subjects in all treatment groups showed a downward trend in the number 
of cigarettes smoked through Week 12. This trend reversed slightly from Week 12 to Week 24 and then 
appears to plateau through the end of study.  
Among 12-17 year olds, subjects in all treatment groups showed a downward trend in the number of 
cigarettes smoked through around Week 12. This trend reversed slightly from Week 12 to Week 24 and 
then appears to plateau through the end of study. 
Results of the statistical analysis of reduction in number of cigarettes smoked for Weeks 12, 24, and 52 
for the FAS population overall and 12-17 year olds are shown in Table 13.

In the FAS population overall, there were no statistically significant differences in the reduction in number 
of cigarettes smoked for the comparison of high-dose varenicline and placebo or low-dose varenicline and 
placebo at Weeks 12, 24, or 52. 
Among 12-17 year olds, there were no statistically significant differences in the reduction in number of 
cigarettes smoked for the comparison of high-dose varenicline and placebo or low-dose varenicline and

Table 14 Summary of Continuous Abstinence Rate from Week 9 through Week 24 and Week 
52, Study A3051073, FAS Population Overall and 12-17 Year Olds 
In the FAS population overall, CAR Week 9 through Week 24 and CAR Week 9 through Week 52 were 
10.1% and 8.3% for high-dose varenicline subjects, 24.3% and 20.4% for low-dose varenicline subjects, 
and 13.0% and 9.0% for placebo subjects, respectively. For the high-dose varenicline comparison to 
placebo, none of the OR’s were statistically significant. For the low-dose varenicline comparison to 
placebo, nominal p-values were obtained for both CAR Week 9 through Week 24 (p=0.0335) and for CAR 
Week 9 through Week 52 (p =0.0188). 
Among 12-17 year olds, CARs for the Week 9 through Week 24 and Week 9 through Week 52 were 13.8% 
and 11.3% for high-dose varenicline subjects, 29.5% and 25.6% low-dose varenicline subjects, and 
13.2% and 10.5% for placebo subjects, respectively. For the high-dose varenicline comparison to 
placebo, none of the OR’s were statistically significant. For the low-dose varenicline comparison to 
placebo, nominal p-values were obtained for both CAR Week 9 through Week 24 (p=0.0162) and for CAR 
Week 9 through Week 52 (p=0.0176).

CHMP comments 
For the FAS overall study population, no significant difference between groups was found for the primary 
efficacy endpoint, CAR week 9-12. Related to the prior expectations of a 24 % abstinence rate in 
treatment groups that the study design was based on, the CAR 9-12 for high-dose varenicline and 
low-dose varenicline was -3.8 % and +  3.2 %, respectively. However, the CAR 9-12 for placebo treated 
subjects was 18% that is twice as high as projected. 
For the post-hoc analysis of the subset of 12-17 years-olds that is of special interest to EMA, the 
corresponding percentages were -5.2, +8.1, and +8.1, respectively. In this subset, a significant 
treatment effect of low-dose varenicline was found, but as this result arises from a post-hoc analysis 
(although a similar result was found in the pre-specified analysis of the 12-16 year old subset) and from 
a violation of the pre-specified statistical analysis plan, it cannot be used as a scientific proof of clinical 
efficacy; it is a nominal finding.  
Regarding the secondary efficacy endpoints, most did not show significant differences between treatment 
groups. However, it seems to be a general trend that low-dose varenicline-treated subjects fared 
somewhat better than high-dose- or placebo-treated subjects are. This impression seems to be reflected 
in the CAR 9-24 and CAR 9-52; these are significantly higher than placebo, but must be viewed as 
nominal findings according to the pre-specified statistical analysis plan. 
Efficacy Conclusions 
The efficacy results from Study A3051073 support the following conclusions: 
• 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the A3051073 study was not met. In the overall study population 
of nicotine-dependent adolescent smokers 12-19 years old, treatment with varenicline (1.0 BID 
and 0.5 mg BID, both doses weight adjusted) along with age appropriate counselling did not 
result in statistically significant improvement in smoking abstinence rates relative to placebo at 
Weeks 9-12. 
•  Varenicline was not shown to be efficacious in the subgroup of nicotine-dependent adolescents 
12-16 years old. 
•  Varenicline was not shown to be efficacious in the subgroup of nicotine-dependent adolescents 
12-17 years old, the population of adolescents of interest in the EU, in post hoc analyses. 
•  Secondary efficacy endpoint analyses, including CAR Weeks 9-24 and Weeks 9-52, 7-day point 
prevalence, and reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, support the negative findings for 
the primary endpoint, as do analyses based on the Completer Subjects population and all 
sensitivity analyses. 
• 
The study was not powered in the 17- 19-year-old stratum and therefore, no model-based 
analyses were performed and no efficacy conclusions can be made in this age group.

7.3.  Discussion  
These conclusions from the presented data are formally correct. However, as has been pointed out in 
previous assessments, study A3051073 must be suspected to be underpowered to demonstrate 
treatment efficacy from the statistical planning phase, with realistic expectations for the treatment effect 
of varenicline, but with an unrealistically low expected placebo response rate. The end-result has been a 
placebo response rate that is twice as high as has been projected in the study power calculation. Notably, 
the low-dose varenicline-treated adolescents seemed to have similar efficacy-results as 
varenicline-treated adult study subjects in previous studies, both with regard to the primary endpoint and 
with regard to several secondary endpoints. The high-dose varenicline-treated adolescents had less 
favourable efficacy results, resulting in statistically insignificant efficacy results compared to placebo. 
In all, it must be suspected, that the MAH’s rejection of vareniclines efficacy in adolescent smokers could 
be due to a Type II error, and the interpretation of the efficacy results for varenicline to adolescent 
smokers remain difficult to interpret with certainty.  
8.  Clinical Safety aspects 
All three adolescent studies, A3051073, A3051070, and A3051029, contributed safety data on the use of 
varenicline in adolescent smokers. The information summarised in this section and in the accompanying 
SCS regarding A3051073 is focused on the safety results in the study population overall and the subgroup 
of subjects 12-17 years old. Full information on the safety results in these groups of subjects, as well as 
in the 12-16 year old and 17-19 year old age strata is provided in the A3051073 CSR. 
Due to the differences in study design apparent in Table 1, notably treatment and follow-up durations, 
data from the three studies are presented individually. For each study, the data presented represent all 
subjects who took at least one dose of study medication, including partial doses. All adverse events (AEs) 
were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version (v) 20.1 and the 
treatment-emergent period was standardized to include the day of first dose of study medication through 
30 days after the last dose. 
8.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study Design 
Study A3051073 
The design of Study A3051073 is described above in Section 2.5.4.1 and in greater detail in the A3051073 
CSR. 
Phase 1 Studies 
Study A3051070 was a Phase 1, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate 
the multiple-dose PK, safety, and tolerability of varenicline in healthy adolescent smokers 12 to 16 years 
old. Subjects were enrolled into a low-body weight (LBW) group (≤55 kg [minimum weight 30 kg]) and 
a high-body weight (HBW) group (>55 kg). Subjects in each body weight group were randomized in a 
2:2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 varenicline doses or placebo. The varenicline doses were 0.5 mg QD or 0.5 mg BID 
in the LBW group and 0.5 mg BID or 1 mg BID in the HBW group. Dosing was titrated over 7 days for the 
0.5 mg BID and 1 mg BID treatment groups (0.5 mg QD for 7 days for the former and 0.5 mg QD for 3 
days, followed by 0.5 mg BID for 4 days for the latter). The treatment period was 14 days and subjects 
were followed through Day 18. Subjects were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Days 1, 8 
and 14 during treatment and Day 16 or 17 during follow-up for PK blood sampling. Subjects were allowed 
to continue smoking at will during the course of the study, although they were offered smoking cessation

counselling at the end of the study. Additional details regarding the study design are provided in 
A3051070 CSR Section 5.1. 
Study A3051029 was a Phase 1, randomized, sponsor-open, investigator- and subject-blind, 
parallel-group, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the single-dose PK, safety, and tolerability 
of varenicline in healthy adolescent smokers 12-17 years old. This study evaluated single doses of 0.5 mg 
and 1 mg varenicline compared to placebo. Subjects were admitted to the CRU the day before dosing 
(Day 0) and remained in the CRU for 48 hours postdose. Additional details regarding the study design are 
provided in the A3051029 CSR Section 5.1. 
Study Population 
All three adolescent studies, A3051073, A3051070, and A3051029, enrolled adolescent smokers who 
were otherwise generally healthy. Inclusion/exclusion study criteria are provided in the individual study 
reports. 
In these three studies, a combined total of 287 adolescent smokers were exposed to varenicline, along 
with 119 adolescent smokers exposed to placebo (Table 1). All subjects who took at least one dose of 
study drug were evaluated for safety. 
Study A3051073 
In Study A3051073, the Safety Population (all subjects who took at least 1 dose of study medication) 
overall included a total of 307 subjects; 108 in the varenicline high-dose group, 100 in the varenicline 
low-dose group and 99 in the placebo group (A3051073 CSR Table 14.1.1.1). The 12-17 year old 
subgroup included a total of 230 subjects; 79 in the varenicline high-dose group, 76 the varenicline 
low-dose group and 75 in the placebo group (A3051073 CSR Table 14.1.1.1.1.a). 
In the Safety Population overall, the majority of subjects in all treatment groups completed treatment; 
the percentages were higher for varenicline than placebo: 69.4% high-dose varenicline subjects, 74.0% 
low-dose varenicline subjects, and 62.6% placebo subjects (A3051073 CSR Table 14.1.1.4). 
Among 12-17 year-olds, the majority of subjects in all treatment groups completed treatment; the 
percentages were higher for varenicline than placebo: 75.9% high-dose varenicline subjects, 82.9% 
low-dose varenicline subjects, and 62.7% placebo subjects (A3051073 CSR Table 14.1.1.4.1.a). 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics for the Safety Population overall and the 12-17 year olds 
are presented above in Section 2.5.4.2. 
Phase 1 Studies 
In Study A3051070, all 72 randomized subjects took study medication; 37 in the LBW group and 35 in the 
HBW group. In the LBW group, this included 14 high dose varenicline subjects, 15 low-dose varenicline 
subjects and 8 placebo subjects and in the HBW group, 14 high-dose varenicline subjects, 14 low-dose 
varenicline subjects, and 7 placebo subjects.  
Two LBW subjects discontinued early, 1 low dose varenicline subject and 1 placebo subject. All HBW 
subjects completed treatment (A3051070 CSR Table 13.1.1). 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics of the subjects in Study A3051070 are provided in 
A3051070 CSR Table 13.2, 13.11 and Appendix B and summarized in SCS Table 15. 
In Study A3051029, all 27 randomized subjects took study medication; 10 varenicline 0.5 mg, 12 
varenicline 1.0 mg and five placebo subjects. All subjects completed the study. (A3051029 CSR Table 
13.1.1).

Demographic and other baseline characteristics of the subjects in Study A3051029 are summarised in 
A3051029 CSR Table 13.2.1 and summarized in SCS Table 16. 
CHMP comments 
The adolescent combined safety population comprises 287 adolescent smokers who were exposed to 
varenicline. It is interesting to note, that in A3051073, the percentages who completed treatment were 
higher for varenicline than placebo, with the highest completer-rate in the low-dose group: 75.9% 
high-dose varenicline subjects, 82.9% low-dose varenicline subjects, and 62.7% placebo subjects. This 
might suggest that subjects in especially the low-dose varenicline group found treatment more 
worthwhile to comply with than the placebo-treated subjects did, which further might suggest that they 
may have been more motivated to complete treatment because they experienced greater efficacy of the 
treatment towards their objective of quitting smoking. 
8.2.  Results 
AE data for all three studies are summarised in the sections below. Data from clinical laboratory testing, 
vital signs, and physical examinations (primarily height and weight) are provided in the individual study 
reports. 
For Study A3051073, data are presented below for the Safety Population overall and for the 12-17 year 
old subgroup. AE data by race, gender and body weight (in 12-16 year olds) are provided in the SCS 
Section 2.7.4.5.2. The analyses of these subpopulations did not identify any group at greater risk for 
safety concerns.

Table 15 All-Causality Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Study A3051073, Safety 
Population Overall 
The percentage of subjects experiencing AEs was higher in the high-dose varenicline group (60.2%) than 
in the low-dose varenicline group (53.0%), which was similar to placebo (52.5%). There were few 
subjects with serious adverse events (SAEs) (5 total) or severe AEs (7 total) overall, and these occurred 
in higher percentages of varenicline subjects than placebo subjects. A higher percentage of high-dose 
varenicline subjects (5.6%) discontinued treatment due to an AE than either low-dose varenicline (2.0%) 
or placebo subjects (4.0%) while the percentage of placebo subjects was higher than low-dose 
varenicline subjects.

Table 18 Most Frequently Reported All-Causality Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
(Preferred Terms ≥5% of Subjects in any Treatment Group), Study A3051073, 
Safety Population 12-17 Year Olds 
Among 12-17 year olds most of the frequent AEs were reported in a higher percentage of high-dose 
varenicline subjects than low-dose varenicline subjects or placebo subject; the two exceptions were 
Nasopharyngitis and Dizziness. Nasopharyngitis was reported in a higher percentage of placebo subjects 
than varenicline subjects were. 
Phase 1 Studies 
In Study A3051070, AEs were reported in low body weight (LBW) subjects by 9/14 high-dose varenicline 
subjects, 11/15 low-dose varenicline subjects and 1/8 placebo subjects. In the high body weight (HBW) 
group AEs were reported by 8/14 high-dose varenicline subjects, 8/14 low-dose varenicline subjects and 
1/7 placebo subjects. No subjects reported SAEs or discontinued due to an AE. One low-dose varenicline 
LBW subject had a severe AE of nausea (SCS Supplemental Table bF14.3.1.2.1 and Table bF14.3.1.2.6). 
AEs reported by 2 or more subjects in any treatment group in Study A3051070 included: Nausea, 
Vomiting, Decreased appetite, Fatigue, Dizziness, Oropharyngeal pain, and Headache in the LBW group 
and Flatulence, Nausea, Vomiting, Abdominal pain upper, and Headache in the HBW group. All these 
events were reported by a greater number of subjects in at least 1 varenicline group than placebo (SCS 
Supplemental Table bF14.3.1.2.6). 
In Study A3051029, AEs were reported in 1/10 0.5 mg varenicline subjects, 2/12 1.0 mg varenicline 
subjects and 1/5 placebo subjects. No subjects reported severe AEs, SAEs or discontinued due to an AE 
(SCS Supplemental Table aF14.3.1.2.1).

The 4 subjects in Study A3051029 who experienced AEs reported Dizziness (1 varenicline 0.5 mg, 2 
varenicline 1.0 mg) and Abdominal pain (1 placebo) (SCS Supplemental Table aF14.3.1.2.6). 
Serious Adverse Events 
Study A3051073 
A total of 5 subjects had at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE; 3 (2.8%) high-dose varenicline, 1 (1.0%) 
low-dose varenicline, and 1 (1.0%) placebo subject (A3051073 CSR Table 14.3.1.2.1.1.1). None of the 
treatment-emergent SAE’s were considered to be related to study drug as judged by the Investigator. 
Four of the 5 SAEs occurred in 12-17 year olds (A3051073 CSR Table 14.3.1.2.1.1.3.a). 
A total of 7 subjects had at least 1 post-treatment-emergent SAE; 3 (2.8%) high-dose varenicline, 2 
(2.0%) low-dose varenicline, and 2 (2.0%) placebo subjects (A3051073 CSR Table 14.3.1.2.1.1.2). None 
of the post-treatment-emergent SAE’s were considered to be related to study drug as judged by the 
Investigator. All of the post-treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 12-17 year olds (A3051073 CSR Table 
14.3.1.2.1.1.3.1.a). 
Phase 1 Studies 
No subjects in Study A3051070 had treatment-emergent SAE’s (SCS Supplemental Table bF14.3.1.2.1). 
No subjects in Study A3051029 had treatment-emergent SAE’s (SCS Supplemental Table aF14.3.1.2.1). 
Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events 
Study A3051073 
In the Safety Population overall, a total of 12 subjects discontinued study treatment due to an AE: 6 
(5.6%) varenicline high-dose, 2 (2.0%) low-dose varenicline, and 4 (4.0%) placebo subjects. Two of 
these subjects discontinued study treatment due to pregnancy (1 low-dose varenicline and 1 placebo; 
both remained in the study). Two of the subjects who discontinued treatment also discontinued the study; 
1 (0.9%) high-dose varenicline and 1 (1.0%) placebo subject. Two additional subjects, both placebo, 
discontinued the study in the post-treatment phase due to post-treatment emergent AEs, 1 of which had 
discontinued study treatment due to previous AEs (A3051073 CSR Table 14.3.1.1.4, Table 14.3.1.1.1). 
Among 12-17 year olds, 3 (3.8%) high-dose varenicline and 3 (4.0%) placebo subjects discontinued 
study treatment due to AEs, 1 subject in each of these treatment groups also discontinued the study due 
to the AEs. In addition, the 2 placebo subjects who discontinued the study in the post-treatment phase 
were 12-17 year olds (A3051073 CSR Table 14.3.1.1.4.1.a, Table 14.3.1.1.1.1.a) 
Phase 1 Studies 
No subjects discontinued due to an AE in Study A3051070 (SCS Supplemental Table bF14.3.1.2.1). 
No subjects discontinued due to an AE in Study A3051029 (SCS Supplemental Table aF14.3.1.2.1). 
Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events 
Study A3051073 
At the time of protocol development for Study A3051073, neuropsychiatric (NPS) events were emerging 
as a potential safety concern with the use of varenicline in adult smokers. 
Therefore, an analysis of NPS events was included in Study A3051073. 
A pre-specified list of NPS events of interest was used in the analysis (Study A3051073 SAP Appendix 1). 
In addition to volunteered NPS AEs, the study utilized the Neuropsychiatric Adverse Event Interview 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 48/73 
 
 
 
(NAEI) to solicit NPS events (see Study A3051073 Protocol, Appendix 4). Treatment-emergent NPS AEs 
are summarized for the Safety Population overall in Table 19 and for 12-17 year olds in Table 20. 
Table 19 All-Causality Treatment-Emergent Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events, Study 
A3051073, Safety Population Overall 
NPS AEs were reported by 16.7%, 11.0% and 12.1% of high-dose varenicline subjects, low dose 
varenicline subjects, and placebo subjects, respectively. The majority of NPS events were solicited. The 
most frequent NPS AEs were Agitation (8.3%, 5.0%, 5.1%; high-dose varenicline, low-dose varenicline 
and placebo, respectively), Anxiety (5.6%, 4.0%, 7.1%), and Hostility (6.5%, 3.0%, and 4.0%). The 
majority of events were mild (27/30, 13/18, and 16/23) and none were severe (A3051073 CSR Table 
14.3.1.5.6.1.1). None of the NPS AE’s were SAEs and 1 low-dose varenicline subject and 3 placebo 
subjects discontinued treatment due to an NPS AE (A3051073 CSR Table 14.3.1.5.1.1).

Table 20 All-Causality Treatment-Emergent Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events, Study 
A3051073, Safety Population 12-17 Year Olds 
Among 12-17 year olds, NPS AE’s were reported by a higher percentage of high-dose varenicline subjects 
(13.9%) than low-dose varenicline (5.3%) and placebo subjects (5.3%). 
The majority of NPS events were solicited. The most frequent NPS AEs were Agitation (5.1%, 1.3%, 
1.3%; high-dose varenicline, low-dose varenicline and placebo, respectively), Anxiety (3.8%, 1.3%, 
4.0%), and Hostility (7.6%, 2.6%, 0%). All NPS events were mild except for 1 report of Hallucination in 
a high-dose varenicline subject and 1 report of Anxiety in a low-dose varenicline subject which were 
moderate (A3051073 CSR Table 14.3.1.5.6.1.1.1.a), none were SAEs and none in varenicline subjects 
led to treatment discontinuation, although 3 placebo subjects discontinued treatment due to NPS AEs 
(A3051073 CSR Table 14.3.1.5.1.1.1.a). 
Phase 1 Studies 
In Study A3051070, two subjects reported NPS AEs of interest: 1 HBW high-dose varenicline subject 
reported mild Anger and 1 LBW low-dose varenicline subject reported moderate Mood swings. (SCS 
Supplemental Table bF14.3.1.2.6)  
No subjects in Study A3051029 reported NPS AEs of interest. (SCS Supplemental Table aF14.3.1.2.6)  
Other Psychiatric Assessments 
In Study A3051073, the C-SSRS was administered at each clinic visit along with the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS). These scales were not administered in Studies A3051070 and A3051029. 
In Study A3051073, psychiatric assessments were performed and reviewed by a qualified mental health 
professional who was a paediatric/adolescent psychiatrist or PhD paediatric/adolescent psychologist. 
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
Assessment report

In Study A3051073, there were few positive responses on the C-SSRS. During treatment (and up through 
30 days after last study dose), 2 subjects had positive responses: 1 high-dose varenicline subject 
reported suicidal ideation and 1 placebo subject reported both suicidal ideation and self-injurious 
behaviour with no suicidal intent. During follow-up (31 days post-treatment to end of study), there were 
no positive C-SSRS responses. Additional information regarding C-SSRS responses is provided in the 
A3051073 CSR, Section 12.3.5.  
There were two other subjects who had suicide-related post-treatment emergent AEs that were not 
reported on the C-SSRS. One high-dose varenicline subject was hospitalized for severe suicidal ideation 
152 days after the last dose of study medication, and 1 low-dose varenicline subject was hospitalized for 
severe, non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour 178 days after the last dose of study medication. Details 
regarding these two subjects are provided in A3051073 CSR Section 14.3.3. 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
Over the 12-week treatment period, there was a decline in mean HADS sub-scores for both anxiety and 
depression in all treatment groups, indicating slight improvement. Over the 40-week non-treatment 
follow-up period, sub-scores for anxiety and depression remained at or slightly below end-of-treatment 
levels in all treatment groups (A3051073 CSR Table 14.5.4.1.1). 
Few subjects in any treatment group (
6  s u b je c t s )  s h o w e d  a  c a t
-scores for 
either anxiety or depression. In most cases, this shift represented a worsening of scores, e.g., normal 
(0-7) to suggestive (8-10) or suggestive to probable (11+) (A3051073 CSR Table 14.5.4.2.1 and Table 
14.5.4.3.1). One high-dose varenicline subject and 1 placebo subject improved at least 1 category in 
anxiety sub-score and 2 subjects in the high dose varenicline group improved at least 1 category in 
depression sub-score. 
Postmarketing Data 
A search of the Sponsor’s safety database identified a total of 113 cases, out of the total of 134,996 
varenicline cases as of 07 February 2018, which involved adolescent patients 12-17 years old. Among the 
113 cases were 10 cases in which an overdose of varenicline was taken, 5 of the cases specified the 
overdose was a suicide attempt and four cases specified that the varenicline belonged to the patient’s 
mother/grandmother. There were three cases of accidental ingestion of varenicline. In addition, there 
were eight cases in which it was stated the patient did not take varenicline/fill the prescription or it was 
unclear whether they had. These 21 cases were not considered in further case analysis. 
Review of the remaining 92 cases identified 27 that included no AEs other than those that coded to a 
Preferred Term (PT) associated with the use of the drug in an adolescent. The 27 cases reported the 
following PTs: Product use issue (22), Drug administered to patient of inappropriate age (2), Drug 
prescribing error (1), Drug administration error (1), and off label use (1). One other case reported only 
the event of Tobacco user and one additional case reported only Blood carbon monoxide increased, which 
was related to the patient smoking and was not considered an adverse event by the reporter. 
Among the remaining 63 cases, 27 had insufficient information to properly assess the case (including the 
Victim of homicide case). Another 10 cases included factors that could have contributed to the event(s), 
primarily medical history conditions (including the Completed suicide case). In the remaining 26 cases, a 
role for varenicline could not be ruled out. The PTs reported in these 26 cases do not suggest any new 
safety concerns in adolescents treated with varenicline relative to the known safety profile of varenicline 
in adults.  
Additional details about the post marketing cases, which involved adolescent patients 12-17 years old, 
are provided in SCS Section 2.7.4.6.

CHMP comments 
The pattern of adverse events in A3051073 was similar to the known adverse events profile of varenicline 
in adults. There are no signals indicating new safety concerns arising from study A3051073, or signals 
indicating that special concern for specific adverse events among adolescent varenicline-treated patients 
is warranted. Notably, this includes neuropsychiatric adverse events. The adverse event profile seems to 
be dose-related, with the low-dose varenicline group experiencing fewer adverse events than the high 
dose group, with an adverse events profile that is very similar to placebo, with the exception of higher 
percentages of nausea. The safety data from the two additional studies did not raise new concerns, and 
the post marketing data do not present any clear signals of concern. 
MAH’s Safety Conclusions 
The safety results from Studies A3051073, A3051070 and A3051029 support the following conclusions: 
• 
• 
The most commonly reported AEs for all varenicline doses used in these studies were consistent 
with the known safety profile of varenicline in adults. 
In Study A3051073, in general, common AEs (reported in ≥5% of subjects) were reported in a 
higher percentage of high-dose varenicline subjects than low-dose varenicline subjects, overall 
(12-19 year olds) and in subgroups including 12-17 year olds and 12-16 year olds and 17-19 year 
olds. 
•  Based on categories pre-specified in Study A3051073 SAP, neuropsychiatric (NPS) AEs were 
analysed in this study. In general, the types of events, as well as their frequency and severity, 
raised no new safety concerns relative to the known safety profile of varenicline use in adults. 
Overall, the majority of NPS AEs (70%-90%) were mild, and none was severe. 
• 
In Study A3051073, no differences in positive Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
responses or suicide-related AE’s were seen among treatment groups.  
•  Based on analyses of safety data in subpopulations of subjects in A3051073 based on age, race, 
gender, and weight, no subpopulation of adolescents was identified to be at greater risk for safety 
concerns. 
•  Review of adolescent post marketing cases in the Sponsor’s safety database did not identify any 
safety concerns specific to the adolescent population.

8.3.  Discussion  
Study A3051073 provided safety results suggesting that the adverse event profile of varenicline is similar 
among adolescents to the adverse event profile among adult smokers. This seems to be the case 
regardless of sex, weight, maturity or race. The incidence of adverse events increases with increased 
varenicline dose, probably resulting in lower compliance and treatment adherence, which the results of 
Study A3051073 may seem to suggest. Notably, there does not seem to be increased risk of 
neuropsychiatric adverse events, including suicide-related AE’s, associated with varenicline treatment 
among adolescents.  In all, the safety results in the studies of varenicline in adolescents do not give rise 
to new concerns about the drug’s safety. 
9.  The MAH’s Benefits and Risks Conclusions 
Adolescents both in the US and globally continue to initiate cigarette smoking and research has shown 
that they can quickly become dependent on nicotine. Survey data show that many of these adolescent 
smokers want to quit but most are not successful. 
Considering that in the US, 88% of adult daily smokers reported their first use of cigarettes occurred by 
18 years of age and in the United Kingdom, 40% of regular smokers began smoking before the age of 16 
years, and that the benefits of stopping smoking are greater for smokers who quit at a younger age, 
effective smoking cessation treatments for nicotine dependent adolescents represents an important and 
unmet medical need. To date, there has been only limited research to address this need and the results 
of the few studies that have been conducted have, for the most part, not been positive. Previous studies 
with smoking cessation methods, both pharmacological (bupropion and NRT) and non-pharmacological, 
that have shown efficacy in adults have failed to show consistent positive effects in adolescents. 
Varenicline Study A3051073, the design of which was agreed with FDA and secondarily complied with 
EMA’s Article 46 requirement of an assessment of the use of varenicline in 12-17-years old adolescents, 
addressed several elements of specific concern when treating adolescent smokers including: a longer 
titration period (2 weeks compared to the recommended 1 week in adults) to potentially improve 
tolerability, weight adjusted dosing to account for the smaller body size of adolescents compared to 
adults, evaluation of both the recommended adult dose (1 mg BID) and a lower dose (0.5 mg BID) and 
age-appropriate counselling that allowed flexibility to tailor to an individual subject’s needs. The study 
inclusion criteria ensured the requirement for a nicotine-dependent adolescent population was met. 
Study inclusion criteria required subjects to have been smoking an average of at least 5 cigarettes per day 
during the 30 days prior to screening, to have a total score of 4 or higher on the FTND (adolescent 
version), which is consistent with at least moderate dependence, to be motivated to stop smoking and to 
have made at least 1 prior serious quit attempt.  
Efficacy results from Study A3051073 showed that neither high-dose varenicline nor low dose varenicline 
had a statistically significant benefit compared to placebo in achieving smoking cessation in the study 
population overall (12-19 year olds) or in the subset of adolescents 12-17 years old. Regarding the 
primary endpoint of CAR for Week 9 through Week 12, among the 12-17 year olds in the FAS population, 
rates were 18.8% for high-dose varenicline subjects, 32.1% for low-dose varenicline subjects, and 
17.1% for placebo subjects, with an OR for the high-dose vs placebo comparison of 1.13 (95% CI: 0.50 
to 2.56) and a p-value of 0.7753 and an OR for low-dose varenicline vs placebo of 2.28 (95% CI: 1.06 to 
4.89) and a p-value of 0.0347 (considered nominal and not statistically significant based on pre-specified 
statistical decision rules). Analyses of secondary cessation endpoints including CARs for Week 9 through 
Week 24 and Week 9 through Week 52, and 7-day point prevalence of abstinence at Weeks 12, 24 and 
52, all supported the negative findings for the primary endpoint; no statistically significant differences

were noted for the high-dose varenicline vs placebo comparisons or the low-dose vs placebo 
comparisons. Likewise, reduction in number of cigarettes smoked at Weeks 12, 24 and 52 showed no 
statistically significant differences between varenicline and placebo. In addition, analyses of the primary 
and secondary endpoints in the Completer Subjects population and various sensitivity analyses did not 
demonstrate statistically significant efficacy results for either varenicline treatment group compared to 
placebo.  
Safety results showed that both high-dose varenicline and low-dose varenicline were generally well 
tolerated in the overall study population and in 12-17 year olds and no new safety concerns were 
identified. The type and relative frequencies of common AEs were similar to those seen in adults treated 
with varenicline. The most common AEs in varenicline subjects 12-17 years old (
5 %  o f s u b je c t s  
either varenicline group) were: Nausea (22.8% high-dose varenicline, 19.7% low-dose varenicline, 8.0% 
placebo), Vomiting (10.1%, 1.3%, 1.3%), Upper respiratory tract infection (6.3%, 5.3%, 0%), Dizziness 
(5.1%, 9.2%, 2.7%), Agitation (5.1%, 1.3%, 1.3%), Headache (8.9%, 2.6%, 6.7%), and Hostility 
(7.6%, 2.6%, 0%). A total of 5 subjects had treatment-emergent SAEs, 4 of whom were 12-17 years old 
(3 high–dose varenicline, 1 placebo); none of the SAEs were considered related to study drug as judged 
by the Investigator. There were no deaths in the study. The safety profile in the two Phase 1 adolescent 
studies likewise raised no safety concerns. 
PK analyses for Study A3051073 showed that the observed range of varenicline exposure was consistent 
with that expected for each dose and body weight group from the results obtained in the Phase 1 
adolescent PK studies, supporting that varenicline dose and administration were appropriate. 
The exposure-response analyses in Study A3051073 showed that the CAR Week 9 through Week 12 did 
not increase with increasing varenicline systemic exposure [i.e., AUC24], as the logistic regression 
analyses for efficacy showed no significant relationship with AUC24.  
This finding, which is not consistent with what was seen in adults, supports the negative findings for the 
primary endpoint from the study. The nausea/vomiting incidence did increase linearly with increasing 
varenicline exposure; there was a statistically significant trend with the addition of AUC24 as a linear 
function (p-value <0.001). This finding, which is consistent with what was seen in adults, shows that 
varenicline was pharmacologically active in the adolescent subjects. 
The relatively high rate of smoking abstinence in placebo-treated subjects (e.g., 17.1% in 12-17 year 
olds for CAR Week 9 through Week 12), which was similar to that seen in placebo groups in adult 
varenicline studies, suggests that the counselling provided to the adolescent subjects as part of the study 
conduct was appropriate and effective. 
There was no evidence found of randomization failure, systematic study drug dispensing errors, or 
systematic errors in study conduct that would have impacted study outcomes. 
Sensitivity analyses excluding data from a site that had GCP concerns, showed that those data had no 
impact on study outcomes. 
In spite of the negative efficacy findings from Study A3051073, this study makes an important 
contribution to the limited body of research on pharmacotherapy smoking cessation treatments for 
adolescent smokers. The results are consistent with those of previous studies that have found that 
therapies that are efficacious in adults are not necessarily efficacious in adolescents. 
Based on the A3051073 efficacy outcomes, the benefits of varenicline treatment in adolescents 12-19 
years old or 12-17 years old have not been shown to outweigh the risks.  
The MAH believes that Study A3051073 as designed and conducted satisfies the postmarketing 
requirement for CHAMPIX under PAM (MEA 047). Proposed CHAMPIX labeling revisions based on Study

CHMP comments 
Adolescent smoking is a public health problem. There is limited research of pharmacological therapy for 
smokers in this age group, prior studies of bupropion and NRT have not shown efficacy, and A3051073 is 
the only clinical study of efficacy and safety of varenicline for young smokers, age 12-19. 
The study design was agreed with the FDA and secondarily complied with EMA’s Article 46 requirement of 
an assessment of the use of varenicline in 12-17-years old adolescents. The fundamental study design is 
deemed appropriate for demonstrating efficacy and safety in this population of smokers.  
A3051073 was designed with 3 study groups (2 active-treatment arms and one placebo arm) and 
projected with a 100 study subjects per group, from postulated CAR rates week 9-12 (primary endpoint) 
of 24% for varenicline and of 9% for placebo. This turned out to be an unrealistically low expected placebo 
response rate, as the study resulted in a placebo response rate that is twice as high as was projected with 
in the study power calculation. Thus, the study may not be sufficiently powered to detect statistically 
significant differences between the active treatment groups and the placebo group. The analysis of 
efficacy results showed no significant treatment effect of varenicline at a high dose, while low-dose 
varenicline did result in reduced smoking as measured by the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint 
of CAR response 9 to 52 weeks was also significantly better in the low-dose varenicline group. However, 
as the pre-specified analysis plan requires significant efficacy of high-dose treatment before a secondary 
analysis of low-dose treatment is made, these findings cannot serve as scientifically valid proof of efficacy 
of low-dose varenicline treatment. However, the results of A3051073 suggests that a clinically 
meaningful effect of low-dose varenicline treatment in adolescents may exist.  
In conclusion, the efficacy results for varenicline in adolescent smokers are difficult to interpret with 
certainty, as it must be suspected that the MAH’s rejection of vareniclines efficacy in adolescent smokers 
could be due to a Type II error.  
However, the observation that the CAR Week 9 -12 did not increase with increasing varenicline systemic 
exposure in the pattern that has been observed in adults is interesting, and to some extent supports the 
efficacy results in A3051073. 
The safety results showed that both high-dose varenicline and low-dose varenicline were generally well 
tolerated. The pattern of adverse events in A3051073 was similar to the adverse events profile of 
varenicline in adults. The adverse event profile seems dose-related, with the low-dose varenicline group 
experiencing fewer adverse events than the high-dose group, with an adverse events profile that is very 
similar to placebo, with the exception of higher percentages of nausea. There are no signals indicating 
new safety concerns arising from study A3051073, or from the two Phase 1 adolescent studies. This 
includes neuropsychiatric adverse events, which could conceivably be of concern in an immature target 
population. The MAH’s post marketing database does not suggest new safety concerns in adolescents 
relative to the known safety profile of varenicline in adult smokers. In all, the safety results of the 
adolescent studies are reassuring, with the caveat that the overall Safety Population is of limited size.  
Based on A3051073’s efficacy outcomes, the benefits of varenicline treatment in adolescents of 12-17 
years of age has not been demonstrated to outweigh the risks. However, it is debatable whether the 
Study A3051073 as designed and conducted satisfies the post marketing requirement for CHAMPIX under 
PAM (MEA 047). 
The proposed labelling changes could be approvable, pending changes in the wording of the update of 5.1 
in the SmPC.

date of 11-09-2018 with this application. The main proposed RMP changes were the following: 
• 
• 
The RMP has been updated to include information from the study A3051073 – “A twelve week 
randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, dose ranging study with follow-up 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of varanicline for smoking cessation in healthy adolescent 
smokers” 
The RMP has been rewritten to comply with the GVP module V (revision 2) format 
In addition to the above, the following changes have been implemented to the safety concerns in the RMP 
(version 11.0) as a consequence of procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00003099/201705 (PSUR assessment 
for the reporting period 10-05-2014 to 09-05-2017) and endorsed by PRAC. 
• 
• 
The important potential risk “neuropsychiatric symptoms” has been removed from the RMP 
The missing information regarding “use in adolescents” has been removed from the RMP 
Part II – SI Epidemiology of the indications and target population 
Target Population and Indication 
The target population for varenicline is adult smokers and the indication for which varenicline treatment 
is intended is smoking cessation. It was approved in the USA as Chantix in May 2006 and in Europe as 
Champix in September 2006 as an aid to smoking cessation treatment in adults, and smoking cessation 
in adults, respectively. 
Incidence 
Every year the Office of Applied Studies at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration uses data from their annual National Survey of Drug Use and Health to retrospectively 
estimate the incidence of daily smoking in the USA. This incidence is expressed as number of persons 
initiating daily smoking for the first time per 1000 person-years. Since smoking typically begins during 
adolescence or early adulthood, incidence rates are estimated for these age groups only.  
The incidence of daily smoking during 2003 was 29.5 among 12-17 years old subjects and 26.3 among 
18-25 year-olds. Incidence rates for Europe were not found. 
Prevalence 
According to the WHO’s “European Health for All” database, 28.8% of the adult population of the 
European Union (EU) smoked on a daily basis in 2002. In Europe, 29.4% smoked on a daily basis in 2002. 
The available data for individual countries in the EU indicate the highest smoking prevalence rates in 
Greece (37.6%), Germany (33.9%), and Hungary (33.8%). The lowest rates are in Sweden (16.2%), 
Belgium (20%), and Portugal (20.5%). The prevalence of daily smoking in the three most populous EU 
member states is 33.9% in Germany, 30% in France, and 26% in the United Kingdom.

CHMP comments  
The module needs further updating as the requirements for the content have changed as outlined in the 
GVP module V guideline revision 2. Therefore, the module should give an overview of the epidemiology, 
avoid detailed discussions on specific epidemiology studies or published articles and should only present 
information that is relevant for the identification of the safety concerns. Furthermore, the module still 
refers to data e.g. for incidence and prevalence as they were in 2003. This should be updated with more 
recent data to give a more accurate overview of the epidemiology.  
Part II – SII Non-clinical part of the safety specification 
This module has been updated to comply with the GVP module V (rev 2) guideline. The module is 
acceptable as is.  
Part II – SIII Clinical trial exposure  
This module has been updated with data from the recently finalised study A3051073. The module is 
acceptable as is.  
Part II – SIV Populations not studied in clinical trials  
The following exclusion criteria were used in the pivotal studies within the development programme: 
• 
Paediatric patients 
No longer considered missing information due to the study A3051073 
•  Use in pregnancy 
Still considered missing information 
• 
• 
• 
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
No longer considered missing information due to the study A3051054 
Patients with cardiovascular disease 
Still considered missing information  
Patients with mental disorders 
No longer considered missing information due to the studies A3051072, A3051122 and A3051123 
CHMP comments  
As endorsed by PRAC, use in adolescents should no longer be considered missing information. The 
module is acceptable and in accordance with the GVP module V (rev 2) guideline.  
Part II – SV Post authorisation experience  
Method used to calculate exposure 
Estimated patient exposure is based on an extrapolation of worldwide unit sales of varenicline, as 
reported by IQVIA (formerly IMS Health Prescribing Insights Medical) during the third quarter of 2006 
through the first quarter of 2018. Dividing the total Standard Units by an estimated daily regimen of 2 
units daily and by 365.25 days per year yields an estimate of total patient-years of exposure to 
varenicline. This estimate provides only an approximation of patient exposure. Many factors such as 
varying dosing levels and frequency, compliance issues and relationship between sales data and actual 
prescriptions confound a precise calculation of exposure. 
Please note that these estimations of patient-years provide only a gross approximation of patient 
exposure, and should not be used to determine Adverse Event (AE) incidence or rates. The following 
factors hamper an accurate calculation of the total number of patients exposed to varenicline: 
•  Dosing and frequency vary for this product, particularly during the titration phase. The patient 
exposure estimate has been calculated using the typical dosing frequency, 2 times daily. 
• 
Lack of adherence, as not all patients comply with their prescribed dosage regimen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 57/73 
 
 
 
•  As the patient exposure calculation is based on sales data, it does not necessarily correlate with 
the amount of varenicline administered. 
Exposure 
The cumulative worldwide marketing exposure to varenicline from 31-07-2006 (date of first marketing) 
through 31-05-2018 is estimated to be 5,789,363 patient-years. This estimated patient exposure is 
based on an extrapolation of worldwide sales of 4,229,129,793 units as reported by IQVIA during the 
third quarter of 2006 through the first quarter of 2018 and an estimated regimen of two units of 
varenicline daily. The sales from 01-04-2018 to 31-05-2018 have been extrapolated by taking the 
average of sales of previous 4 quarters. 
Cumulative estimated exposure by indication, gender, age group, dose, formulation, and region 
extrapolated from data are tabulated in the RMP.  
CHMP comments  
The module has been updated to comply with the GVP module V (rev 2) guideline. The exposure data for 
varenicline has been updated to data lock point (31-05-2018) and tabulated by indication, age, gender, 
dose, formulation and region. The module is acceptable as is.  
Part II – SVI Additional EU requirements for the safety specification 
The chemical properties of varenicline make it an unlikely candidate for illegal, illicit, or surreptitious use. 
It can be synthesised only in an industrial setting. Its bitter taste would be difficult to mask. Varenicline 
is not a precursor for any currently controlled substance. Because of dose-limiting nausea and vomiting, 
it is unlikely that individuals would be able to increase the dose of varenicline in order to obtain increased 
pharmacologic effect. 
CHMP comments  
It is agreed that the potential for varenicline abuse or misuse is very limited. The module is acceptable as 
is.  
Part II – SVII Identified and potential risks  
SVII.1 - Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission 
No important identified risks were included in the initial EU-Risk Management Plan (RMP) submission, 
dated January 2006. The single important potential risk of effects of smoking cessation was included in 
the initial RMP submission.

SVII.2 - New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an updated RMP  
There have been no newly identified safety concerns since submission of the previous EU- RMP that are 
considered to warrant inclusion in this update. From the previous RMP, there were no important identified 
risks, and the following important potential risks identified in the previous RMP remain in the current 
version. 
Important Potential Risk 1: Myocardial Infarction 
Following Post-Marketing (PM) reports of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients taking varenicline, the 
CHMP requested the varenicline SmPC to be updated with this information. The MAH reviewed the PM 
database and analysed all cases reporting MI-related events. From the analysis of the reported cases, it 
was concluded that the case frequency does not exceed the rate that could be expected based on current 
epidemiological knowledge, with most cases reporting coexisting cardiovascular risk factors. However, in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 58/73 
 
 
 
 
the opinion of the CHMP, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors does not exclude an additional 
contributory risk from the use of varenicline. Therefore, upon request by the CHMP, the following 
information was added to Section 4.8 of the SmPC: “PM cases of MI have been reported in patients taking 
varenicline.”  
Based on the outcomes of the FDA review of Study A3051049 in smokers with stable CVD, it was noted 
that certain events, including heart attack, were reported more frequently in patients treated with 
varenicline than in patients treated with placebo. In addition, on 06-07-2011, following publication of a 
cardiovascular meta-analysis by Singh et al. in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ), EMA 
requested the MAH to submit a variation to include more information on cardiovascular events in the 
Champix product information. On 22-07-2011, FDA requested conduct of a meta-analysis evaluating the 
incidence of cardiovascular AEs in varenicline-treated patients compared to control patients in MAH 
sponsored randomised CTs. The final study report for this analysis was submitted to EMA on 13-02-2012. 
On 22-09-2011, FDA issued a request for an amendment to Study A3051123 to include additional 
cardiovascular safety data collection and independent adjudication of cardiovascular events, including 
hospitalisation for cardiovascular and certain pulmonary diagnoses, including a non-treatment, 28-week 
extension (A3051148). Study A3051148 completed LSLV on 10-07-2015; the final clinical study report 
submission is due by March 2017. On 18-10-2012, the varenicline SmPC was updated following review of 
the meta-analysis of cardiovascular AEs in controlled varenicline clinical studies. 
Important Potential Risk 2: Suicide/suicidal ideation 
Since the submission of the January 2007 varenicline RMP, the Rapporteur communicated a request to 
assess suicidal ideation/suicide in relation to varenicline. Subsequently, a cumulative review of PM 
experience has been provided in each submitted PSUR. PhV and risk management activities relating to 
suicidal ideation/suicide are further discussed in III.1 and V.1, respectively. An analysis of varenicline 
benefit risk, with focus on suicide-related events was submitted to CHMP on 28-11-2008. The analysis 
outlined the phenomenon of stimulated PM reporting of suicide-related events that appeared to occur 
subsequent to initial media activity around a well-publicised case, followed by regulatory actions and MAH 
communications. Given the absence of a control group to inform the understanding of spontaneous 
reported events, their interpretation requires consideration of the population in which those events are 
occurring. When compared with the general population, the prevalence of depression and other 
psychiatric illnesses is significantly increased in smokers, who are at increased risk of suicide (in the 
absence of treatment with varenicline), thus complicating the understanding of the potential role of 
varenicline in the suicides reported in PM data. The analysis also contained a systematic review of what is 
known of the properties of varenicline relative to depression and suicide-related events, as demonstrated 
in the CT database and as described in the CT literature, which indicate that varenicline does not have a 
profile that would suggest a causal relationship to suicide-related events. Specifically, in controlled CTs, 
there was no evidence for an increased risk of depression or suicide-related events in smokers treated 
with varenicline compared to smokers receiving control treatments-in fact, the available evidence 
suggests that symptoms of depressed mood show some improvement in varenicline-treated patients 
compared to those treated with placebo. The MAH concluded that with appropriate continuing efforts to 
mitigate and to quantify risk, varenicline provides the best treatment option to aid patients seeking to 
escape the health consequences of smoking, and that the benefit/risk profile of varenicline remains very 
favourable. The Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) for Clinical Neuroscience (CNS) concluded that there is 
(at present) no suggestive evidence that depressed smokers on varenicline are at increased risk with 
regards to suicide-related events, over and above the increased risk they carry as a result of their 
previous history of depression, in line with the information currently reported in the SmPC. The view of 
the SAG was endorsed by CHMP. 
The SAG also recommended that the MAH perform a CT in a population of smokers with previous 
and/concomitant depression, and missing information in patients with depression was added to the RMP 
Assessment report

at that time. This double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients with a clinical diagnosis of major 
depressive disorder has been completed, and results are provided in the SmPC. No new safety concerns 
were identified in this study and the category of missing information in patients with depression has been 
removed at the time of update of the RMP. 
A non-interventional study has also completed (A3051143; formerly NRA3050022), for which the primary 
objective was to assess whether current clinical practices among the Health Improvement Network GPs in 
the UK in managing individuals attempting to quit smoking with varenicline are consistent with the 
updated SmPC. 
An overall evaluation of psychiatric events from pooled data (PAM 038) from clinical studies A3051072, 
A3051115, A3051095, A3051122 and A3051139 has also been conducted. A meta-analysis of these 5 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, including a total of 1,907 subjects (1,130 
varenicline, 777 placebo), was conducted to assess suicidal ideation and behaviour as reported on the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). This meta-analysis included one trial (N = 127) in 
subjects with a history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and another trial (N = 525) in subjects 
with a history of depression. The results showed no increase in the incidence of suicidal ideation and/or 
behaviour in subjects treated with varenicline compared to subjects treated with placebo, with a Risk 
Ratio (RR) of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.36). Forty-eight (48) of the 55 subjects who reported suicidal 
ideation or behaviour (24 varenicline, 24 placebo) were from the two trials that enrolled patients with a 
history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or depression. Few patients reported these events in 
the other three trials (4 varenicline, 3 placebo). A second meta-analysis assessed a broad range of NPS 
AEs, including all High Level Group Terms (HLGTs) in the Psychiatric disorders SOC and was based on 
data from 18 completed randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (including the 5 trials in the 
C-SSRS meta-analysis). These 18 trials included a total of 8,521 subjects (5,072 varenicline and 3,449 
placebo). The results of the analysis showed an increase in the HLGT Sleep disorders and disturbance for 
varenicline versus placebo; however, sleep-related AEs are known to be associated with varenicline 
treatment. Excluding events in the Sleep disorders and disturbances HLGT, the RR for varenicline versus 
placebo, per 100 subject years of exposure, for the Psychiatric disorders SOC overall was 1.01 (95% CI: 
0.89, 1.15). When only moderate and severe AEs were considered, the RR was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.74, 
1.09), showing no evidence of a statistically significant difference in risk between varenicline and placebo. 
The most frequent AEs in both treatment groups coded to the HLGTs Anxiety disorders and symptoms, 
depressed mood disorders and disturbances, and mood disorders and disturbances NEC, all of which 
encompass common nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Information regarding these analyses, as well as 
newly available observational study data, has been included in the varenicline SmPC. 
On 29-10-2015, the A3051123 NPS safety study was completed, providing high-level evidence that the 
use of varenicline, bupropion, and NRT are not associated with an increased risk of NPS AEs, based on a 
composite primary endpoint of AE terms for which concern had been raised by PM reports for varenicline 
and bupropion. These study results add and confirm above data from meta-analyses of CT data and 
recently published large observational studies, outlined below. 
Data from four large, independent population-based observational studies, which found no increased risk 
of serious NPS events, were previously added to the SmPC. These studies included patients with and 
without a history of psychiatric disorders and evaluated NPS hospitalisations, diagnoses of NPS events 
during emergency department visits and in-patient admissions, and fatal and non-fatal self-harm. Since 
these studies were included in the SmPC, the MAH has become aware of three additional independent 
population-based observational studies that have been published. 
One of the studies was a national cohort study, which identified all Swedish residents aged 15 and older 
treated with varenicline between November 2006 and December 2009 using the Swedish national 
registers. The primary analyses evaluated the association of use of varenicline with three psychiatric 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 60/73 
 
 
 
conditions (psychoses, mood conditions, and anxiety conditions), suicidal behaviour, criminal behaviour 
and traffic accidents and traffic offences. The study used a within person analyses to control for 
confounding by indication, such that each study subject served as his/her own control and time during 
varenicline treatment (12 weeks from the date of the first collected prescription) was compared to time 
while not treated with varenicline. The analyses also considered people with pre-existing psychiatric 
conditions and those without such conditions. A total of 69,757 individuals treated with varenicline were 
identified. There was no evidence that varenicline treatment was associated with an increased risk of 
suicidal behaviour, conviction for or suspicion of criminal offences, transport accidents, or conviction for 
or suspicion of traffic offences. Among those with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, varenicline 
treatment was associated with a small increased risk of incident anxiety conditions (Hazard Ratio [HR] 
=1.23; 95% CI: 1.01-1.51) and incident mood conditions (HR=1.31; 95% CI: 1.06-1.63) but not incident 
psychoses. Among those with no pre-existing psychiatric conditions, varenicline treatment was not 
associated with an increased risk of any of the three incident psychiatric conditions studied.  
The second study compared the mental health status of adult smokers using varenicline or bupropion to 
smokers quitting without medication, current smokers and non-smokers using data from the 2006-2011 
US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Mental health status was assessed using the mental component 
summary from the 12-item Short Form survey, 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and Kessler 6 Scale. 
A cross-sectional analysis of 125 new episodes of varenicline use, 453 new episodes of bupropion use, 
1550 subjects who quit smoking without using drug, 7117 current smokers and 39,347 non-smokers was 
conducted. The results showed that after adjusting for potential confounders, the mental health status of 
varenicline users was not different from current smokers or former smokers who quit without medication, 
but was worse than non-smokers. Use of bupropion was strongly associated with lower mental health 
status compared to smokers, former smokers who quit without medication, and non-smokers, even after 
adjusting for pre-existing psychiatric disorders.  
The third was a cohort study of National Health Service patients from England, which were identified from 
the validated QResearch database. Patients aged 18–100 years who received a prescription of NRT, 
bupropion, or varenicline were followed up for 6 months to compare NPS and cardiovascular events. In 
total, 164,766 patients who received a prescription (106,759 for nicotine replacement treatment; 6557 
for bupropion; 51,450 for varenicline) between 01-01-2007 and 30-06-2012 were included in the 
analysis. Treatment with varenicline or bupropion resulted in no increased risk of any NPS or 
cardiovascular events compared with NRT. Varenicline was associated with a significantly reduced risk 
compared to NRT of depression (HR 0.66 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.69]) and self-harm (HR 0.56 [95% CI: 0.46, 
0.68]), as well as cardiovascular events including the following:  
Ischaemic heart disease (HR 0.80 [95% CI: 0.72, 0.87),  
• 
•  Cerebral infarction (HR 0.62 [95% CI: 0.52, 0.73]),  
•  Heart failure (HR 0.61 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.83]),  
•  Arrhythmia (HR 0.73 [95% CI: 0.60, 0.88]). 
Important Potential Risk 3: Seizure events 
Upon review of reported seizure cases presented in PSUR 3, the CHMP requested an update to the 
varenicline SmPC. It was noted by the Rapporteur that where varenicline was discontinued, the reported 
seizures resolved with no recurrences, and that the cases reported on seizure-related events gave rise to 
suspicion that varenicline further lowers the threshold for seizures in persons with predisposing risk 
factors, which lower the seizure threshold. Seizure-related events were first reviewed by the MAH in PSUR 
2, and cumulative analyses were presented in PSUR 3, 4, 5 and 6. The cumulative review of 
seizure-related events for PSUR 6 compared seizure-related events in patients with a medical history of 
seizures with those in patients without a medical history of seizure. In addition, seizure-related events 
were previously discussed in the MAH's review submitted to the EMEA entitled “Champix (varenicline

tartrate)-PSUR 3 review: Response to the Rapporteur’s Preliminary Assessment Report” (16-05-2008) 
and in the MAH's response “Overdose and seizure” (FUM 0030). A Retrospective Claims Database 
Analysis of New Onset Seizure Diagnosis in Varenicline Patients was also included and discussed in PSUR 
5 (Section 9.2.1.4 and Appendix 12). PSUR 7 included a cumulative perspective and an analysis of current 
reporting period cases reporting seizure-related events. In addition, the results of a pre-clinical study 
examining the effect of varenicline on seizure threshold in rats and the occurrence of seizure-related 
events in varenicline CTs and in a prescription event monitoring study were discussed in PSUR 7. The MAH 
continues to monitor reported seizure cases, and a review of reported cases for the period is presented in 
PSURs. All reviews to date have concluded that an update to the varenicline labelling information is not 
warranted. However, based on the seriousness of the event, the potential risk of seizures was previously 
added to the RMP (Varenicline RMP version 8.0, Section 2.3.3). With the submission of PSUR 9 (DLP 
10-05-2011- 09-05-2012), the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) requested a 
cumulative report on seizure-like events and a revision of SmPC Sections 4.4, 4.8 and the Package Leaflet 
(PL), Sections 2 and 4. The CHMP adopted the PRAC recommendation on 13-12-2012, followed by the 
Commission Decision on 11-03-2013.  
Important Risks Removed from the List of Safety Concerns 
In accordance with the final PSUR assessment report (dated 11-01-2018) of the varenicline PSUR 
covering the reporting period of 10-05-2014 through 09-05-2017, the MAH in agreement with the PRAC 
recommendation has removed the important potential risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms since there is 
no evidence to support an increased risk of NPS with the use of varenicline. 
SVII.3 – Details of important identified, important potential and missing information 
The MAH has provided sufficient details for each of the safety concerns for varenicline.  
CHMP comments  
The information in sections SVII.1 and SVII.3 is sufficient and the sections are acceptable as is. Section 
SVII.2 however, needs revision, as only the recent changes to the safety concerns should be included and 
described in this section. Therefore, the text regarding myocardial infarction, suicide / suicidal ideation 
and seizure events should be deleted. Consequently, the focus should be on the removal of the safety 
concerns “neuropsychiatric symptoms” and “use in adolescents” and the reasoning behind this should be 
further elaborated.  
Part II – SVIII Summary of the safety concerns  
The MAH has provided the following summary table of the safety concerns.

CHMP comments  
The removal of the important potential risk “neuropsychiatric symptoms” is acceptable and in accordance 
with the conclusions of PSUSA procedure EMEA/H/C/00003099/201705.  
As study A3051073 “a double-blind, placebo-controlled smoking cessation study in healthy adolescent 
smokers” has been finalised, it is agreed that the missing information “use in adolescents” can be deleted. 
This is also in line with PRAC endorsement following the above PSUSA procedure. 
The module is acceptable as is. However, the MAH should reassess the safety concerns in light of the 
updated GVP module V (rev 2) as there are no additional risk minimisation measures or additional 
pharmacovigilance activities attached. Any changes to the safety concerns should be presented in module 
SVII.2 and properly justified. The entire RMP should be updated with any changes to the safety concerns. 
Part III – Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
There are no routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse event reporting and signal detection. 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
There are no ongoing or planned additional pharmacovigilance activities to assess effectiveness of risk 
minimisation measures.  
Summary table of additional pharmacovigilance activities 
Not applicable.  
CHMP comments 
The specific adverse drug reaction follow-up questionnaires for “homicide” and for the safety concerns 
“suicide / suicidal ideation” and “seizure events” should be included and described in section III.1 – 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities. The format of Part III is otherwise in accordance with the GVP 
module V (rev 2) guideline.  
Part IV – Plans for post authorisation efficacy studies  
There are no planned post-authorisation efficacy studies that are conditions of the marketing 
authorisation or that are a specific obligation at this time. 
Part V – Risk minimisation measures (including evaluation of the effectiveness of risk minimisation 
activities) 
The MAH has provided the following summary table of pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimisation

Annexes 
In Annex 2 (tabulated summary of planned, ongoing and completed pharmacovigilance study 
programme), only three completed PASS studies are listed. However, according to GVP module V (rev 2) 
guideline, this annex should list all completed studies from previous RMP versions. The annexes are 
otherwise appropriate.  
11.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP could be acceptable provided an updated RMP and satisfactory responses to 
the request for supplementary information are submitted.  
On  08  May  2019  the  MAH  submitted  RMP  version  11.1,  together  with  satisfactory  responses  to  the 
request for supplementary information above outlined.  
RMP version 11.1 is considered acceptable. 
12.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated to 
reflect  that  CHAMPIX  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  paediatric  patients  because  its  efficacy  in  this 
population was not demonstrated . The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

“Results from this study showed that neither varenicline dose significantly increased continuous 
abstinence rates at weeks 9 through 12 of treatment compared with placebo in subjects 12-19 
years of age or in subjects 12-16 years of age. The study was not powered to assess efficacy in 
adolescent smokers 17-19 years of age, and in this group conclusions cannot be drawn.”

The MAH should present the actual results from Table 5, for the overall population and the 12-17 
year-olds, with Confidence Intervals for the treatment comparisons. This should be done in order 
for the SmPC reader to get an overview of the study data. 
RMP aspects 
2.  In Part II, module SI needs further updating as the requirements for the content have changed as 
outlined in the GVP module V guideline revision 2. Therefore, the module should give an overview 
of the epidemiology, avoid detailed discussions on specific epidemiology studies or published 
articles and should only present information that is relevant for the identification of the safety 
concerns. Furthermore, the module refers to data e.g. for incidence and prevalence as they were 
in 2003. This should be updated with more recent data to give a more accurate overview of the 
epidemiology.  
3.  In Part II, section SVII.2 requires revision, as only the recent changes to the safety concerns 
should be included and described in this section. Therefore, the text regarding myocardial 
infarction, suicide / suicidal ideation and seizure events should be deleted. Consequently, the 
focus should be on the removal of the safety concerns “neuropsychiatric symptoms” and “use in 
adolescents” and the reasoning behind this should be further elaborated.  
4.  In Part II module SVIII, the MAH should reassess the safety concerns in light of the updated GVP 
module V (rev 2) as there are no additional risk minimisation measures or additional 
pharmacovigilance activities attached to any of the safety concerns for Champix. Any changes to 
the safety concerns should be presented in module SVII.2 and properly justified. The entire RMP 
should be updated with any changes made to the safety concerns.  
5.  The pharmacovigilance plan (Part III.1 of the RMP) should be updated with information regarding 
the specific adverse drug reaction follow-up questionnaires for “homicide” and for the safety 
concerns “suicide / suicidal ideation” and “seizure events”. 
6.  In Part V, the tables in modules V.1 and V.3 should be updated with references to the PIL, as the 
patient information leaflet is part of both routine risk minimisation measures and routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
7.  In Annex 2 (tabulated summary of planned, ongoing and completed pharmacovigilance study 
programme), only three completed PASS studies are listed. However, according to GVP module V 
(rev 2) guideline, this annex should list all completed studies from previous RMP versions.

Question 1  
Instead of the proposed wording of the update of SmPC point 5.1: 
“Results from this study showed that neither varenicline dose significantly increased continuous 
abstinence rates at weeks 9 through 12 of treatment compared with placebo in subjects 12-19 years of 
age or in subjects 12-16 years of age. The study was not powered to assess efficacy in adolescent 
smokers 17-19 years of age, and in this group conclusions cannot be drawn.” 
The MAH should present the actual results from Table 11, for the overall population and the 12-17 
year-olds, with Confidence Intervals for the treatment comparisons. This should be done in order for the 
SmPC reader to get an overview of the study data. 
MAH’s response 
The MAH proposes to update Section 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics with the results from  
Table 11 of the clinical overview as follows [deletions are shown in strike-through and additions in 
underlined red text]. 
As acknowledged in the Assessment report (Section 7.2 Results), the MAH has added a footnote to the 
table in the SmPC, to clarify the results for the prescriber that given the pre-specified statistical decision 
rules and the lack of statistical significance for the high-dose varenicline group, the p-value  for the low 
dose varenicline vs. placebo result was also considered nominal and is therefore not statistically 
significant. 
Paediatric Population 
The efficacy and safety of varenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled 
study of 312 patients aged 12 to 19 years, who smoked an average of at least 5 cigarettes per day during 
the 30 days prior to recruitment, and had a score of at least 4 on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine 
Dependence scale. Patients were stratified by age (12-16 years of age and 17-19 years of age) and by 
body weight (≤55 kg and >55 kg). Following two-week titration, patients randomised to varenicline with 
a body weight >55 kg received 1 mg twice daily (high dose group) or 0.5 mg twice daily (low dose 
group), while patients with a body weight ≤55 kg received 0.5 mg twice daily (high dose group) or 0.5 
mg once daily (low dose group). Patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a non-treatment 
period of 40 weeks, along with age-appropriate counseling throughout the study.

Results from this study showed that neither varenicline dose significantly increased continuous 
abstinence rates at weeks 9 through 12 of treatment compared with placebo in subjects 12-19 years of age 
or in subjects 12-16 years of age. The study was not powered to assess efficacy in adolescent smokers 
17-19 years of age, and in this group conclusions cannot be drawn. The varenicline safety profile in this 
study was consistent with that shown in adult studies (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
The following table from the above paediatric study shows a comparison of continuous abstinence rates 
(CAR) from weeks 9-12, confirmed by urine cotinine test, for the full analysis set overall study 
population and the 12-17 year old population.

have quit based on urine cotinine test. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The proposed update of 5.1 presents the data from study A3051073, as requested. The inserted footnote 
is deemed necessary in order to avoid misunderstandings arising from the presented low p-value for 
Low-Dose Varenicline vs Placebo. In all, the update succinctly summarizes the study and its results.  
Issue solved.

Question 2  
In Part II, module SI needs further updating as the requirements for the content have changed as 
outlined in the GVP module V guideline revision 2. Therefore, the module should give an overview of the 
epidemiology, avoid detailed discussions on specific epidemiology studies or published articles and should 
only present information that is relevant for the identification of the safety concerns. Furthermore, the 
module refers to data e.g. for incidence and prevalence as they were in 2003. This should be updated with 
more recent data to give a more accurate overview of the epidemiology.  
Summary of MAH’s response 
The United States (US) National Library of Medicine PubMed and Embase databases were searched for 
primary research and literature reviews in the English language in humans published between 
01-01-2000 and 28.02-2019. Particular focus was placed on identifying studies of European populations. 
The following search terms were used: “smoking” OR “cigarettes” OR “lung cancer” OR “other cancers” 
OR “coronary heart disease” OR “stroke/cerebrovascular disease” OR “respiratory disease” OR “suicide” 
OR “suicidal ideation” AND “incidence” OR “initiation” OR “prevalence” OR “risk factors” OR 
“comorbidities” OR “morbidity” OR “mortality”. 
Incidence and Prevalence 
Every year the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) uses data from 
their annual National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to retrospectively estimate the incidence 
of daily smoking in the USA. This incidence is expressed as the number of persons who smoked part or all 
of a cigarette for the first time in the past 12 months. Since smoking typically begins during adolescence 
or early adulthood, incidence information is estimated for these age groups only. In 2017, an estimated 
604,000 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (i.e., 2.4% of adolescents) smoked part or all of a cigarette for 
the first time in the past year; this number averages to approximately 1,700 adolescents each day who 
initiated cigarette smoking. In 2017, 1.2 million young adults aged 18 to 25 years (i.e., 3.4% of young 
adults) initiated cigarette use in the past year, which translates to about 3,200 young adults who initiated 
cigarette use each day. 
Similar information on cigarette initiation in Europe was not found. However, a 2018 pooled data analysis 
of six multicentre studies involved in the Ageing Lungs in European Cohorts consortium, which included 
119,104 subjects from 17 countries, provided crude rates of smoking initiation per 1,000/year. In the 
male population, the crude incidence ranged from 15.2 to 66.4 among 11- to 15-year-olds, 18.1 to 67.1 
among 16- to 20-year-olds, and 3.2 to 8.9 among 21- to 25-year-olds; in the female population, the 
crude incidene ranged from 22.3 to 80.2 among 11- to 15-year-olds, 20.1 to 67.3 among 16- to 
20-year-olds, and 2.8 to 10.7 among 21- to 25-yeard-olds. 
Demographics of the target population  
Among EU member states, more men smoke as compared with women. The sole exception is Denmark, 
where 15% of male subjects and 17% of female subjects smoke.3 At the EU level, 2014 Eurostat data 
illustrate that the proportion of daily smokers of cigarettes was 17.5% among men aged 15 to 24 years 
vs. 13.5% among women aged 15 to 24 years, 29.7% among men aged 25 to 34 years vs. 19.2% among 
women aged 25 to 34 years, 28.0% among men aged 35 to 44 years vs. 19.0% among women aged 35 
to 44 years, 25.9% among men aged 45 to 54 years vs. 20.6% among women aged 45 to 54 years, 
22.3% among men aged 55 to 64 years vs. 16.8% among women aged 55 to 64 years, 12.2% among 
men aged 65 to 74 years vs. 8.4% among women aged 65 to 74 years, and 5.5% among men aged 75 
years or older vs. 3.2% among women aged 75 years or older. The age profile of daily smokers was 
similar for men and women: the proportion increased between the age groups 15–24 years and 25–34 
years; for the age groups from 25–34 years to 45–54 years, the proportion of daily smokers remained 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 69/73 
 
 
 
generally high; thereafter the proportions fell, with by far the lowest proportion of daily smokers among 
the older age groups. Most EU member states follow this broad pattern, with the highest proportions 
reported between the ages of 25 and 54 and the lowest in the age groups over 65.6 
No studies that evaluated smoking by race/ethnic origin at the EU level were found. However, studies in 
the UK revealed mixed results. A 2017 cross-sectional study that included routinely collected primary care 
data from four multi-ethnic London boroughs found that over half of white British and white Irish 
respondents had ever smoked while only a fifth of black African and Indian respondents had ever smoked. 
The researchers also discovered that respondents in all ethnic groups other than white Irish were 
significantly less likely to have ever smoked than white British, with odds ratios ranging from 0.21 (95% 
CI 0.21 to 0.22) for the Indian group to 0.90 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.91) for the other white group. However, 
a 2011 crude analysis of data from the Health Surveys for England indicated that Bangladeshi and Black 
Caribbean men report higher current smoking rates than other men, while white and Black Caribbean 
women smoke more frequently than other women do. Nonetheless, the smoking rates of Pakistani men 
and Black Caribbean women were significantly lower than white English people after adjusting for 
socio-economic status. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The module has been updated with recent data and the long descriptive paragraphs have been removed. 
The module is acceptable. 
Issue resolved 
Conclusion 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance 
Question 3  
In Part II, section SVII.2 requires revision, as only the recent changes to the safety concerns should be 
included and described in this section. Therefore, the text regarding myocardial infarction, suicide / 
suicidal ideation and seizure events should be shorten. Consequently, the focus should be on the removal 
of the safety concerns “neuropsychiatric symptoms” and “use in adolescents” and the reasoning behind 
this should be further elaborated. 
MAH’s response 
All background information regarding myocardial infarction, suicide / suicidal ideation, and seizure events 
has been deleted from Section SVII.2.   
Based on further evaluation regarding Question 4, the text in Section SVII.2 has been revised to include 
a rationale for removal of the important potential risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the proposed 
removal of important potential risks of myocardial infarction, suicide / suicidal ideation, and seizure 
events that is consistent with criteria provided in GVP Module 5 (rev 2). The entire RMP has accordingly 
been updated to remove these safety concerns throughout. The rationale for removal of “use in 
adolescents” is also provided in Section SVII.2, as requested. 
The following text is provided in module SVII.2. 
There have been no newly identified safety concerns since submission of the previous EU- RMP that are 
considered to warrant inclusion in this update.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/327148/2019  
Page 70/73 
 
 
 
Regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms, Study A3051123 (‘EAGLES’ NPS Study) showed that the use of 
varenicline for smoking cessation in patients with or without history of psychiatric disorder was not 
associated with an increased risk of serious NPS AEs compared with placebo. In the final PSUR 
assessment report (dated 11-01-2018) of the varenicline PSUR covering reporting period of 10-05-2014 
through 09-05-2017, PRAC concluded that there is no evidence to support an increased risk of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms with the use of varenicline. The MAH is in agreement with the PRAC’s 
conclusion and has removed the important potential risk of NPS as a safety concern for varenicline. 
The important potential risks of myocardial Infarction, suicide / suicidal ideation, and seizure events 
included in the prior version of this RMP were reassessed in light of the updated GVP module V (Rev 2) in 
order to determine the appropriateness of their continued inclusion at the time of the current update. For 
each of these risks, additional pharmacovigilance activities have been concluded and none of the safety 
concerns has been confirmed as important identified risks. No further additional pharmacovigilance 
activities are planned and there is no reasonable expectation that any pharmacovigilance activity could 
further characterise the risk. In addition, there are no additional risk minimisation measures attached to 
any of the safety concerns, beyond communication to healthcare professionals and patients via the SmPC 
and Patient Information Leaflet, respectively. 
As there are no additional risk minimisation measures or additional pharmacovigilance activities attached 
to any of the safety concerns, including myocardial infarction, suicide / suicidal ideation, and seizure 
events, the MAH proposes to remove these safety concerns as important potential risks. 
Missing information for use in adolescents is being removed at the time of this update, following 
completion of Study A3051073, A Twelve Week, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled, Parallel 
Group, Dose Ranging Study with Follow up Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Varenicline for Smoking 
Cessation in Healthy Adolescent Smokers.  
Although safety results of study A3051073 showed that varenicline was generally well tolerated and no 
new safety concerns were identified in the overall safety population at both high- and low-doses, the 
primary endpoint of continuous abstinence rate Week 9 through Week 12 was not met. Based on the 
A3051073 efficacy outcomes, the benefits of varenicline treatment in nicotine dependent adolescent 
smokers have not been shown to outweigh the risks. The SmPC will reflect this information to state that 
varenicline is not recommended in paediatric patients due to a lack of efficacy. Use in adolescents is no 
longer considered an area of missing information. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The module has been updated and the text regarding the safety concerns myocardial infarction, suicide / 
suicidal ideation, and seizure events has been updated as requested. Furthermore, the MAH’s proposal to 
remove these risks from the RMP is agreed. The risks are well-known and fully characterised and 
furthermore, there are no additional pharmacovigilance or additional risk minimisation measures 
associated with these risks under use of varencline.

Question 4  
In Part II module SVIII, the MAH should reassess the safety concerns in light of the updated GVP module 
V (rev 2) as there are no additional risk minimisation measures or additional pharmacovigilance activities 
attached to any of the safety concerns for Champix. Any changes to the safety concerns should be 
presented in module SVII.2 and properly justified. The entire RMP should be updated with any changes 
made to the safety concerns.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Please see the response to Question 3. As per the updated GVP module V (rev 2), all important potential 
risks have been proposed to be removed from the varenicline RMP, since there are no additional risk 
minimisation measures or additional pharmacovigilance activities attached to any of the important 
potential risks. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The proposal to remove the important identified risks of myocardial infarction, suicide / suicidal ideation, 
and seizure events can be agreed as the risks are fully characterised and sufficiently managed in clinical 
settings. The missing information regarding use in patients with cardiovascular disease and use in 
pregnancy remain as safety concerns in the RMP. 
Issue resolved 
Conclusion 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 5  
The pharmacovigilance plan (Part III.1 of the RMP) should be updated with information regarding the 
specific adverse drug reaction follow-up questionnaires for “homicide” and for the safety concerns 
“suicide / suicidal ideation” and “seizure events”. 
MAH’s response 
Since the MAH is proposing to remove all important potential risks from the varenicline RMP, the follow-up 
questionnaires have been removed from Annex 4. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The removal of the follow-up questionnaires is agreed.  
Issue resolved 
Conclusion 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 6 
In Part V, the tables in modules V.1 and V.3 should be updated with references to the PIL, as the patient 
information leaflet is part of both routine risk minimisation measures and routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
Since the MAH is proposing to remove all important potential risks from the varenicline RMP, there are no 
routine risk minimization measures described in the RMP that require reference to the PIL. The PIL has 
now been referenced in the tables regarding areas of missing information. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The references made to the PIL are appropriate.  
Issue resolved 
Conclusion 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 7  
In Annex 2 (tabulated summary of planned, ongoing and completed pharmacovigilance study 
programme), only three completed PASS studies are listed. However, according to GVP module V (rev 2) 
guideline, this annex should list all completed studies from previous RMP versions. 
MAH’s response 
The MAH has updated RMP Annex 2 as requested. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided a tabulated summary of all planned ongoing and completed pharmacovigilance 
studies for Champix as requested.  
Conclusion 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

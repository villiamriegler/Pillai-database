CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Simulect is indicated for the prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in de novo allogeneic renal 
transplantation in adult and paediatric patients (1-17 years) (see section 4.2). It is to be used 
concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based immunosuppression, in 
patients with panel reactive antibodies less than 80%, or in a triple maintenance immunosuppressive 
regimen containing ciclosporin for microemulsion, corticosteroids and either azathioprine or 
mycophenolate mofetil. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Simulect should be prescribed only by physicians who are experienced in the use of 
immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplantation. Simulect should be administered under 
qualified medical supervision. 
Simulect must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will receive the graft 
and concomitant immunosuppression. 
Simulect is to be used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based 
immunosuppression. It can be used in a ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based triple 
immunosuppressive regimen including azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.

Posology 
Adults 
The standard total dose is 40 mg, given in two doses of 20 mg each. 
The first 20 mg dose should be given within 2 hours prior to transplantation surgery. The second 
20 mg dose should be given 4 days after transplantation. The second dose should be withheld in the 
event of a severe hypersensitivity reaction to Simulect or post-operative complications such as graft 
loss (see section 4.4). 
Children and adolescents (1–17 years) 
In paediatric patients weighing less than 35 kg, the recommended total dose is 20 mg, given in two 
doses of 10 mg each. In paediatric patients weighing 35 kg or more, the recommended dose is the 
adult dose, i.e. a total dose of 40 mg, given in two doses of 20 mg each. 
The first dose should be given within 2 hours prior to transplantation surgery. The second dose should 
be given 4 days after transplantation. The second dose should be withheld in the event of a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction to Simulect or post-operative complications such as graft loss (see 
section 4.4). 
Elderly ( 65 years) 
There are limited data available on the use of Simulect in the elderly, but there is no evidence that 
elderly patients require a different dosage from younger adult patients. 
Method of administration 
Reconstituted Simulect can be administered as an intravenous bolus injection or as an intravenous 
infusion over 20–30 minutes. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Patients receiving Simulect must be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate 
laboratory and supportive medical resources, including medications for the treatment of severe 
hypersensitivity reactions. 
Immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medications increase the susceptibility to 
infection, including opportunistic infections, fatal infections and sepsis; the risk increased with total 
immunosuppressive load. 
Simulect must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will receive the graft 
and concomitant immunosuppression.

Hypersensitivity reactions 
Severe acute (less than 24 hours) hypersensitivity reactions have been observed both on initial 
exposure to Simulect and on re-exposure to a subsequent course of therapy. These included 
anaphylactoid-type reactions such as rash, urticaria, pruritus, sneezing, wheezing, hypotension, 
tachycardia, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, pulmonary oedema, cardiac failure, respiratory failure and 
capillary leak syndrome. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, therapy with Simulect must be 
permanently discontinued and no further dose be administered. Caution should be exercised when 
patients previously given Simulect are re-exposed to a subsequent course of therapy with this 
medicinal product. There is accumulating evidence that a subgroup of patients is at an increased risk 
of developing hypersensitivity reactions. These are patients in whom, following the initial 
administration of Simulect, the concomitant immunosuppression was discontinued prematurely due, 
for example, to abandoned transplantation or early loss of the graft. Acute hypersensitivity reactions 
were observed on re-administration of Simulect for a subsequent transplantation in some of these 
patients. 
Neoplasms and infections 
Transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations with or without 
basiliximab are at increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) (such as 
lymphoma) and opportunistic infections (such as cytomegalovirus [CMV], BK virus). In clinical trials, 
the incidence of opportunistic infections was similar in patients using immunosuppressive regimens 
with or without Simulect. In a pooled analysis of two five-year extension studies, no differences were 
found in the incidence of malignancies and LPDs between immunosuppressive regimens with or 
without combination of basiliximab (see section 4.8). 
Vaccination 
No data are available on either the effects of live and inactive vaccination or the transmission of 
infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Simulect. Nevertheless, live vaccines are not 
recommended for immunosuppressed patients. The use of live attenuated vaccines should therefore be 
avoided in patients treated with Simulect. Inactivated vaccines may be administered to 
immunosuppressed patients; however, response to the vaccine may depend on the degree of the 
immunosuppression, therefore vaccination during treatment with Simulect may be less effective. 
Use in heart transplantation 
The efficacy and safety of Simulect for the prophylaxis of acute rejection in recipients of solid organ 
allografts other than renal have not been demonstrated. In several small clinical trials in heart 
transplant recipients, serious cardiac adverse events such as cardiac arrest (2.2%), atrial flutter (1.9%) 
and palpitations (1.4%) have been reported more frequently with Simulect than with other induction 
agents. 
Excipients with known effect 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicinal product contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially 
‘potassium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Because basiliximab is an immunoglobulin, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are to be expected. 
In addition to ciclosporin for microemulsion, steroids, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, other 
concomitant medications routinely administered in organ transplantation have been administered in 
clinical trials without any incremental adverse reactions. These concomitant medications include 
systemic antiviral, antibacterial and antimycotic medications, analgesics, antihypertensive medications 
such as beta-blocking agents or calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. 
Human antimurine antibody (HAMA) responses were reported in a clinical trial of 172 patients treated 
with basiliximab, without predictive value for clinical tolerability. The incidence was 2/138 in patients 
not exposed to muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) and 4/34 in patients who received muromonab-CD3 
concomitantly. The use of basiliximab does not preclude subsequent treatment with murine 
antilymphocyte antibody preparations. 
In the original phase III studies during the first 3 months post-transplantation, 14% of patients in the 
basiliximab group and 27% of patients in the placebo group had an acute rejection episode treated with 
antibody therapy (OKT 3 or antithymocyte globulin/antilymphocyte globulin [ATG/ALG]), with no 
increase in adverse events or infections in the basiliximab group as compared to placebo. 
Three clinical trials have investigated basiliximab use in combination with a triple therapy regimen 
which included either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. The total body clearance of basiliximab 
was reduced by an average 22% when azathioprine was added to a regimen consisting of ciclosporin 
for microemulsion and corticosteroids. The total body clearance of basiliximab was reduced by an 
average 51% when mycophenolate mofetil was added to a regimen consisting of ciclosporin for 
microemulsion and corticosteroids. The use of basiliximab in a triple therapy regimen including 
azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil did not increase adverse events or infections in the basiliximab 
group as compared to placebo (see section 4.8). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Simulect is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.3). Basiliximab has potentially 
hazardous immunosuppressive effects with respect to the course of gestation and the suckling neonate 
exposed to basiliximab in breast milk. Women of childbearing potential must use effective 
contraception during and up to 16 weeks after treatment. 
There is no animal or human data available concerning excretion of basiliximab into breast milk. 
However, based on the IgG1 nature of basiliximab, excretion into milk should be expected. Breast-
feeding must therefore be avoided. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Simulect has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Basiliximab has been tested in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in renal 
transplant recipients as an induction agent in combination with the following immunosuppressive 
regimens: ciclosporin for microemulsion and corticosteroids in two studies (346 and 380 patients), 
ciclosporin for microemulsion, azathioprine and corticosteroids in one study (340 patients), and 
ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids in another study 
(123 patients). Safety data in paediatric patients have been obtained from one open-label 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in renal transplant recipients (41 patients).

Incidence of adverse events: In the above four placebo-controlled trials, the pattern of adverse events 
in 590 patients treated with the recommended dose of basiliximab was comparable to that observed in 
595 patients treated with placebo. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events among all 
patients in the individual studies was not significantly different between the basiliximab (7.1% - 40%) 
and the placebo (7.6% - 39%) treatment groups. 
Adult patients 
The most commonly reported (> 20%) events following dual or triple therapy in both treatment groups 
(basiliximab vs. placebo) were constipation, urinary tract infection, pain, nausea, peripheral oedema, 
hypertension, anaemia, headache, hyperkalaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, postoperative wound 
complication, weight increase, increase in blood creatinine, hypophosphataemia, diarrhoea and upper 
respiratory tract infection. 
Paediatric population 
The most commonly reported (> 20%) events following dual therapy in both (< 35 kg vs.  35 kg 
weight) cohorts were urinary tract infection, hypertrichosis, rhinitis, pyrexia, hypertension, upper 
respiratory tract infection, viral infection, sepsis and constipation. 
Incidence of malignant neoplasms: The overall incidence of malignancies among all patients in the 
individual studies was similar between the basiliximab and the comparator treatment groups. Overall, 
lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease occurred in 0.1% (1/701) of patients in the basiliximab group 
compared with 0.3% (2/595) of patients receiving placebo, both in combination with dual and triple 
immunosuppressive therapy. Other malignancies were reported among 1.0% (7/701) of patients in the 
basiliximab group compared with 1.2% (7/595) of placebo patients. In a pooled analysis of two five-
year extension studies, the incidence of LPDs and cancer was found to be equal with basiliximab 7% 
(21/295) and placebo 7% (21/291) (see section 4.4). 
Incidence of infectious episodes: The overall incidence and profile of viral, bacterial and fungal 
infections among patients treated with basiliximab or placebo in combination with dual and triple 
immunosuppressive therapy was comparable between the groups. The overall incidence of infections 
was 75.9% in the basiliximab group and 75.6% in the placebo group and the incidence of serious 
infections was 26.1% and 24.8%, respectively. The incidence of CMV infections was similar in both 
groups (14.6% vs. 17.3%), following either dual or triple therapy regimen (see section 4.4). 
The incidence and causes of deaths following dual or triple therapy were similar in basiliximab (2.9%) 
and placebo groups (2.6%), with the most common cause of deaths in both treatment groups being 
infections (basiliximab = 1.3%, placebo = 1.4%). In a pooled analysis of two five-year extension 
studies the incidence and cause of death remained similar in both treatment groups, (basiliximab 15%, 
placebo 11%), the primary cause of death being cardiac-related disorders such as cardiac failure and 
myocardial infarction (basiliximab 5%, placebo 4%). 
Listing of adverse reactions from post-marketing spontaneous reports 
The following adverse reactions have been identified based on post-marketing spontaneous reports and 
are organised by system organ class. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a 
population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. 
Immune system disorders 
Hypersensitivity/anaphylactoid reactions such as rash, urticaria, pruritus, sneezing, wheezing, 
bronchospasm, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema, cardiac failure, hypotension, tachycardia, respiratory 
failure, capillary leak syndrome (see section 4.4). Cytokine release syndrome.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical studies basiliximab has been administered to humans in single doses of up to 60 mg and 
multiple doses of up to 150 mg over 24 days with no acute undesirable effects. 
For information on preclinical toxicology see section 5.3.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC02. 
Mechanism of action 
Basiliximab is a murine/human chimeric monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that is directed against the 
interleukin-2 receptor -chain (CD25 antigen), which is expressed on the surface of T-lymphocytes in 
response to antigenic challenge. Basiliximab specifically binds with high affinity (KD-value 0.1 nM) to 
the CD25 antigen on activated T-lymphocytes expressing the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-
2R) and thereby prevents binding of interleukin-2, a critical signal for T-cell proliferation in the 
cellular immune response involved in allograft rejection. Complete and consistent blocking of the 
interleukin-2 receptor is maintained as long as serum basiliximab levels exceed 0.2 g/ml (usually up 
to 4–6 weeks after administration). As concentrations fall below this level, expression of the CD25 
antigen returns to pretherapy values within 1–2 weeks. Basiliximab does not cause myelosuppression. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of basiliximab in prophylaxis of organ rejection in de novo renal transplantation has been 
demonstrated in double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Results from two pivotal 12-month 
multicentre studies (722 patients in total) comparing basiliximab with placebo show that basiliximab, 
used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion and corticosteroids, significantly reduces the 
incidence of acute rejection episodes both within 6 (31% vs. 45%, p<0.001) and 12 (33% vs. 48%, 
p<0.001) months after transplantation. There was no significant difference between basiliximab and 
placebo-treated patients in graft survival after 6 and 12 months (at 12 months 32 graft losses on 
basiliximab (9%) and 37 graft losses on placebo (10%)). The incidence of acute rejection episode was 
substantially lower in patients receiving basiliximab and a triple drug immunosuppressive regimen. 
Results from two multicentre double-blind studies comparing basiliximab with placebo (463 patients 
in total) show that basiliximab significantly reduces the incidence of acute rejection episodes within 
6 months after transplantation when used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion, 
corticosteroids, and either azathioprine (21% vs. 35%) or mycophenolate mofetil (15% vs. 27%). Graft 
loss occurred in 6% of basiliximab-treated and 10% of placebo-treated patients by 6 months. The 
adverse event profile remained comparable between treatment groups. 
In a pooled analysis of two five-year open-label extension studies (586 patients total) the combined 
graft and patient survival rates were not statistically different for the basiliximab and placebo groups. 
Extension studies also showed that patients who experienced an acute rejection episode during the first 
year after transplantation experienced more graft losses and deaths over the five-year follow-up period 
than patients who had no rejection. These events were not influenced by basiliximab.

Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of basiliximab were evaluated in two paediatric studies. 
Basiliximab was used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion and steroids in an 
uncontrolled study in 41 paediatric de novo renal transplant recipients. Acute rejection occurred in 
14.6% of patients by 6 months post-transplantation, and in 24.3% by 12 months. Overall the adverse 
event profile was consistent with general clinical experience in the paediatric renal transplantation 
population and with the profile in the controlled adult transplantation studies. 
A 12-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre study investigated basiliximab 
in combination with ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids in paediatric 
renal allograft recipients. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority of this 
combination versus treatment with ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids 
in the prevention of acute rejections. Of the 202 patients, 104 were randomised to basiliximab and 98 
to placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint, time to first biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) episode 
or treatment failure defined as graft loss, death or presumptive rejection within the first 6 months post 
transplantation, occurred in 16.7% of basiliximab-treated patients and 21.7% of placebo-treated 
patients. When borderline rejections were included in the primary efficacy endpoint, the rates were 
26.0% and 23.9% respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the basiliximab- 
and placebo-treated groups (HR: 1.04, 90% CI: [0.64; 1.68]). The rates of BPAR were 9.4% in the 
basiliximab group and 17.4% in the placebo group (HR: 0.50, 90% CI: [0.25; 0.99]). When borderline 
rejections were included, the rates were 20.8% and 19.6% respectively (HR: 1.01, 90% CI: [0.59; 
1.72]). The overall safety profiles were similar in both groups. The incidence rates of adverse events 
and the pattern of adverse events were comparable between the two treatment groups and to be 
expected for the treatment regimens and the underlying diseases. 
Immunogenicity 
Of 339 renal transplant patients treated with basiliximab and tested for anti-idiotype antibodies, 4 
(1.2%) developed an anti-idiotype antibody response. In a clinical trial with 172 patients receiving 
basiliximab, the incidence of human antimurine antibody (HAMA) in renal transplantation patients 
treated with basiliximab was 2/138 in patients not exposed to muromonab-CD3 and 4/34 in patients 
who received muromonab-CD3 concomitantly. The available clinical data on the use of muromonab-
CD3 in patients previously treated with basiliximab suggest that subsequent use of muromonab-CD3 
or other murine anti-lymphocytic antibody preparations is not precluded. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Adults 
Single-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in adult patients 
undergoing kidney transplantation. Cumulative doses ranged from 20 mg up to 60 mg. Peak serum 
concentration following intravenous infusion of 20 mg over 30 minutes is 7.15.1 mg/l. There is a 
proportional increase in Cmax and AUC from 20 mg to 60 mg, the range of single-dose administrations 
tested. The volume of distribution at steady state was 8.64.1 l. The extent and degree of distribution 
to various body compartments have not been fully studied. In vitro studies using human tissues 
indicate that basiliximab binds only to activated lymphocytes and macrophages/monocytes. The 
terminal half-life was 7.23.2 days. Total body clearance was 4119 ml/h. 
No clinically relevant influence of body weight or gender on distribution volume or clearance has been 
observed in adult patients. Elimination half-life was not influenced by age, gender, or race. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of basiliximab were assessed in 39 paediatric de novo renal transplantation 
patients. In infants and children (age 1–11 years, n=25), the steady-state distribution volume was 
4.82.1 l, half-life was 9.54.5 days and clearance was 176 ml/h. Distribution volume and clearance 
are reduced by about 50% compared to adult renal transplantation patients. Disposition parameters 
were not influenced to a clinically relevant extent by age (1–11 years), body weight (9–37 kg) or body 
surface area (0.44–1.20 m) in this age group. In adolescents (age 12–16 years, n=14), the steady-state 
distribution volume was 7.85.1 l, half-life was 9.13.9 days and clearance was 3119 ml/h. 
Disposition in adolescents was similar to that in adult renal transplantation patients. The relationship 
between serum concentration and receptor saturation was assessed in 13 patients and was similar to 
that characterised in adult renal transplantation patients. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No toxicity was observed when rhesus monkeys received intravenous doses of either up to 5 mg/kg 
basiliximab twice weekly for 4 weeks followed by an 8-week withdrawal period or 24 mg/kg 
basiliximab weekly for 39 weeks followed by a 13-week withdrawal period. In the 39-week study, the 
highest dose resulted in approximately 1,000 times the systemic exposure (AUC) observed in patients 
given the recommended clinical dose together with concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. 
No maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, or teratogenicity was observed in cynomolgous monkeys 
following injections of up to 5 mg/kg basiliximab administered twice weekly during the organogenesis 
period. 
No mutagenic potential was observed in vitro.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Simulect is indicated for the prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in de novo allogeneic renal 
transplantation in adult and paediatric patients (1-17 years) (see section 4.2). It is to be used 
concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based immunosuppression, in 
patients with panel reactive antibodies less than 80%, or in a triple maintenance immunosuppressive 
regimen containing ciclosporin for microemulsion, corticosteroids and either azathioprine or 
mycophenolate mofetil. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Simulect should be prescribed only by physicians who are experienced in the use of 
immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplantation. Simulect should be administered under 
qualified medical supervision. 
Simulect must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will receive the graft 
and concomitant immunosuppression. 
Simulect is to be used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based 
immunosuppression. It can be used in a ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based triple 
immunosuppressive regimen including azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.

Posology 
Children and adolescents (1–17 years) 
In paediatric patients weighing less than 35 kg, the recommended total dose is 20 mg, given in two 
doses of 10 mg each. In paediatric patients weighing 35 kg or more, the recommended dose is the 
adult dose, i.e. a total dose of 40 mg, given in two doses of 20 mg each. 
The first dose should be given within 2 hours prior to transplantation surgery. The second dose should 
be given 4 days after transplantation. The second dose should be withheld in the event of a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction to Simulect or post-operative complications such as graft loss (see 
section 4.4). 
Adults 
The standard total dose is 40 mg, given in two doses of 20 mg each. 
The first 20 mg dose should be given within 2 hours prior to transplantation surgery. The second 
20 mg dose should be given 4 days after transplantation. The second dose should be withheld in the 
event of a severe hypersensitivity reaction to Simulect or post-operative complications such as graft 
loss (see section 4.4). 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
There are limited data available on the use of Simulect in the elderly, but there is no evidence that 
elderly patients require a different dosage from younger adult patients. 
Method of administration 
Reconstituted Simulect can be administered as an intravenous bolus injection or as an intravenous 
infusion over 20–30 minutes. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Patients receiving Simulect must be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate 
laboratory and supportive medical resources, including medications for the treatment of severe 
hypersensitivity reactions. 
Immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medications increase the susceptibility to 
infection, including opportunistic infections, fatal infections and sepsis; the risk increased with total 
immunosuppressive load. 
Simulect must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will receive the graft 
and concomitant immunosuppression.

Hypersensitivity reactions 
Severe acute (less than 24 hours) hypersensitivity reactions have been observed both on initial 
exposure to Simulect and on re-exposure to a subsequent course of therapy. These included 
anaphylactoid-type reactions such as rash, urticaria, pruritus, sneezing, wheezing, hypotension, 
tachycardia, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, pulmonary oedema, cardiac failure, respiratory failure and 
capillary leak syndrome. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, therapy with Simulect must be 
permanently discontinued and no further dose be administered. Caution should be exercised when 
patients previously given Simulect are re-exposed to a subsequent course of therapy with this 
medicinal product. There is accumulating evidence that a subgroup of patients is at an increased risk 
of developing hypersensitivity reactions. These are patients in whom, following the initial 
administration of Simulect, the concomitant immunosuppression was discontinued prematurely due, 
for example, to abandoned transplantation or early loss of the graft. Acute hypersensitivity reactions 
were observed on re-administration of Simulect for a subsequent transplantation in some of these 
patients. 
Neoplasms and infections 
Transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations with or without 
basiliximab are at increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) (such as 
lymphoma) and opportunistic infections (such as cytomegalovirus [CMV], BK virus). In clinical trials, 
the incidence of opportunistic infections was similar in patients using immunosuppressive regimens 
with or without Simulect. In a pooled analysis of two five-year extension studies, no differences were 
found in the incidence of malignancies and LPDs between immunosuppressive regimens with or 
without combination of basiliximab (see section 4.8). 
Vaccination 
No data are available on either the effects of live and inactive vaccination or the transmission of 
infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Simulect. Nevertheless, live vaccines are not 
recommended for immunosuppressed patients. The use of live attenuated vaccines should therefore be 
avoided in patients treated with Simulect. Inactivated vaccines may be administered to 
immunosuppressed patients; however, response to the vaccine may depend on the degree of the 
immunosuppression, therefore vaccination during treatment with Simulect may be less effective. 
Use in heart transplantation 
The efficacy and safety of Simulect for the prophylaxis of acute rejection in recipients of solid organ 
allografts other than renal have not been demonstrated. In several small clinical trials in heart 
transplant recipients, serious cardiac adverse events such as cardiac arrest (2.2%), atrial flutter (1.9%) 
and palpitations (1.4%) have been reported more frequently with Simulect than with other induction 
agents. 
Excipients with known effect 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicinal product contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially 
‘potassium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Because basiliximab is an immunoglobulin, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are to be expected. 
In addition to ciclosporin for microemulsion, steroids, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, other 
concomitant medications routinely administered in organ transplantation have been administered in 
clinical trials without any incremental adverse reactions. These concomitant medications include 
systemic antiviral, antibacterial and antimycotic medications, analgesics, antihypertensive medications 
such as beta-blocking agents or calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. 
Human antimurine antibody (HAMA) responses were reported in a clinical trial of 172 patients treated 
with basiliximab, without predictive value for clinical tolerability. The incidence was 2/138 in patients 
not exposed to muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) and 4/34 in patients who received muromonab-CD3 
concomitantly. The use of basiliximab does not preclude subsequent treatment with murine 
antilymphocyte antibody preparations. 
In the original phase III studies during the first 3 months post-transplantation, 14% of patients in the 
basiliximab group and 27% of patients in the placebo group had an acute rejection episode treated with 
antibody therapy (OKT 3 or antithymocyte globulin/antilymphocyte globulin [ATG/ALG]), with no 
increase in adverse events or infections in the basiliximab group as compared to placebo. 
Three clinical trials have investigated basiliximab use in combination with a triple therapy regimen 
which included either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. The total body clearance of basiliximab 
was reduced by an average 22% when azathioprine was added to a regimen consisting of ciclosporin 
for microemulsion and corticosteroids. The total body clearance of basiliximab was reduced by an 
average 51% when mycophenolate mofetil was added to a regimen consisting of ciclosporin for 
microemulsion and corticosteroids. The use of basiliximab in a triple therapy regimen including 
azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil did not increase adverse events or infections in the basiliximab 
group as compared to placebo (see section 4.8). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Simulect is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.3). Basiliximab has potentially 
hazardous immunosuppressive effects with respect to the course of gestation and the suckling neonate 
exposed to basiliximab in breast milk. Women of childbearing potential must use effective 
contraception during and up to 16 weeks after treatment. 
There is no animal or human data available concerning excretion of basiliximab into breast milk. 
However, based on the IgG1 nature of basiliximab, excretion into milk should be expected. Breast-
feeding must therefore be avoided. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Simulect has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Basiliximab has been tested in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in renal 
transplant recipients as an induction agent in combination with the following immunosuppressive 
regimens: ciclosporin for microemulsion and corticosteroids in two studies (346 and 380 patients), 
ciclosporin for microemulsion, azathioprine and corticosteroids in one study (340 patients), and 
ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids in another study 
(123 patients). Safety data in paediatric patients have been obtained from one open-label 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in renal transplant recipients (41 patients).

Incidence of adverse events: In the above four placebo-controlled trials, the pattern of adverse events 
in 590 patients treated with the recommended dose of basiliximab was comparable to that observed in 
595 patients treated with placebo. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events among all 
patients in the individual studies was not significantly different between the basiliximab (7.1% - 40%) 
and the placebo (7.6% - 39%) treatment groups. 
Adult patients 
The most commonly reported (> 20%) events following dual or triple therapy in both treatment groups 
(basiliximab vs. placebo) were constipation, urinary tract infection, pain, nausea, peripheral oedema, 
hypertension, anaemia, headache, hyperkalaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, postoperative wound 
complication, weight increase, increase in blood creatinine, hypophosphataemia, diarrhoea and upper 
respiratory tract infection. 
Paediatric population 
The most commonly reported (> 20%) events following dual therapy in both (< 35 kg vs.  35 kg 
weight) cohorts were urinary tract infection, hypertrichosis, rhinitis, pyrexia, hypertension, upper 
respiratory tract infection, viral infection, sepsis and constipation. 
Incidence of malignant neoplasms: The overall incidence of malignancies among all patients in the 
individual studies was similar between the basiliximab and the comparator treatment groups. Overall, 
lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease occurred in 0.1% (1/701) of patients in the basiliximab group 
compared with 0.3% (2/595) of patients receiving placebo, both in combination with dual and triple 
immunosuppressive therapy. Other malignancies were reported among 1.0% (7/701) of patients in the 
basiliximab group compared with 1.2% (7/595) of placebo patients. In a pooled analysis of two five-
year extension studies, the incidence of LPDs and cancer was found to be equal with basiliximab 7% 
(21/295) and placebo 7% (21/291) (see section 4.4). 
Incidence of infectious episodes: The overall incidence and profile of viral, bacterial and fungal 
infections among patients treated with basiliximab or placebo in combination with dual and triple 
immunosuppressive therapy was comparable between the groups. The overall incidence of infections 
was 75.9% in the basiliximab group and 75.6% in the placebo group and the incidence of serious 
infections was 26.1% and 24.8%, respectively. The incidence of CMV infections was similar in both 
groups (14.6% vs. 17.3%), following either dual or triple therapy regimen (see section 4.4). 
The incidence and causes of deaths following dual or triple therapy were similar in basiliximab (2.9%) 
and placebo groups (2.6%), with the most common cause of deaths in both treatment groups being 
infections (basiliximab = 1.3%, placebo = 1.4%). In a pooled analysis of two five-year extension 
studies the incidence and cause of death remained similar in both treatment groups, (basiliximab 15%, 
placebo 11%), the primary cause of death being cardiac-related disorders such as cardiac failure and 
myocardial infarction (basiliximab 5%, placebo 4%). 
Listing of adverse reactions from post-marketing spontaneous reports 
The following adverse reactions have been identified based on post-marketing spontaneous reports and 
are organised by system organ class. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a 
population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. 
Immune system disorders 
Hypersensitivity/anaphylactoid reactions such as rash, urticaria, pruritus, sneezing, wheezing, 
bronchospasm, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema, cardiac failure, hypotension, tachycardia, respiratory 
failure, capillary leak syndrome (see section 4.4). Cytokine release syndrome.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical studies basiliximab has been administered to humans in single doses of up to 60 mg and 
multiple doses of up to 150 mg over 24 days with no acute undesirable effects. 
For information on preclinical toxicology see section 5.3.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC02. 
Mechanism of action 
Basiliximab is a murine/human chimeric monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that is directed against the 
interleukin-2 receptor -chain (CD25 antigen), which is expressed on the surface of T-lymphocytes in 
response to antigenic challenge. Basiliximab specifically binds with high affinity (KD-value 0.1 nM) to 
the CD25 antigen on activated T-lymphocytes expressing the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-
2R) and thereby prevents binding of interleukin-2, a critical signal for T-cell proliferation in the 
cellular immune response involved in allograft rejection. Complete and consistent blocking of the 
interleukin-2 receptor is maintained as long as serum basiliximab levels exceed 0.2 g/ml (usually up 
to 4–6 weeks after administration). As concentrations fall below this level, expression of the CD25 
antigen returns to pretherapy values within 1–2 weeks. Basiliximab does not cause myelosuppression. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of basiliximab in prophylaxis of organ rejection in de novo renal transplantation has been 
demonstrated in double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Results from two pivotal 12-month 
multicentre studies (722 patients in total) comparing basiliximab with placebo show that basiliximab, 
used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion and corticosteroids, significantly reduces the 
incidence of acute rejection episodes both within 6 (31% vs. 45%, p<0.001) and 12 (33% vs. 48%, 
p<0.001) months after transplantation. There was no significant difference between basiliximab and 
placebo-treated patients in graft survival after 6 and 12 months (at 12 months 32 graft losses on 
basiliximab (9%) and 37 graft losses on placebo (10%)). The incidence of acute rejection episode was 
substantially lower in patients receiving basiliximab and a triple drug immunosuppressive regimen. 
Results from two multicentre double-blind studies comparing basiliximab with placebo (463 patients 
in total) show that basiliximab significantly reduces the incidence of acute rejection episodes within 
6 months after transplantation when used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion, 
corticosteroids, and either azathioprine (21% vs. 35%) or mycophenolate mofetil (15% vs. 27%). Graft 
loss occurred in 6% of basiliximab-treated and 10% of placebo-treated patients by 6 months. The 
adverse event profile remained comparable between treatment groups. 
In a pooled analysis of two five-year open-label extension studies (586 patients total) the combined 
graft and patient survival rates were not statistically different for the basiliximab and placebo groups. 
Extension studies also showed that patients who experienced an acute rejection episode during the first 
year after transplantation experienced more graft losses and deaths over the five-year follow-up period 
than patients who had no rejection. These events were not influenced by basiliximab. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of basiliximab were evaluated in two paediatric studies. 
Basiliximab was used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion and steroids in an 
uncontrolled study in 41 paediatric de novo renal transplant recipients. Acute rejection occurred in 
14.6% of patients by 6 months post-transplantation, and in 24.3% by 12 months. Overall the adverse 
event profile was consistent with general clinical experience in the paediatric renal transplantation 
population and with the profile in the controlled adult transplantation studies. 
A 12-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre study investigated basiliximab 
in combination with ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids in paediatric 
renal allograft recipients. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority of this 
combination versus treatment with ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids 
in the prevention of acute rejections. Of the 202 patients, 104 were randomised to basiliximab and 98 
to placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint, time to first biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) episode 
or treatment failure defined as graft loss, death or presumptive rejection within the first 6 months post 
transplantation, occurred in 16.7% of basiliximab-treated patients and 21.7% of placebo-treated 
patients. When borderline rejections were included in the primary efficacy endpoint, the rates were 
26.0% and 23.9% respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the basiliximab- 
and placebo-treated groups (HR: 1.04, 90% CI: [0.64; 1.68]). The rates of BPAR were 9.4% in the 
basiliximab group and 17.4% in the placebo group (HR: 0.50, 90% CI: [0.25; 0.99]). When borderline 
rejections were included, the rates were 20.8% and 19.6%, respectively (HR: 1.01, 90% CI: [0.59; 
1.72]). The overall safety profiles were similar in both groups. The incidence rates of adverse events 
and the pattern of adverse events were comparable between the two treatment groups and to be 
expected for the treatment regimens and the underlying diseases. 
Immunogenicity 
Of 339 renal transplant patients treated with basiliximab and tested for anti-idiotype antibodies, 4 
(1.2%) developed an anti-idiotype antibody response. In a clinical trial with 172 patients receiving 
basiliximab, the incidence of human antimurine antibody (HAMA) in renal transplantation patients 
treated with basiliximab was 2/138 in patients not exposed to muromonab-CD3 and 4/34 in patients 
who received muromonab-CD3 concomitantly. The available clinical data on the use of muromonab-
CD3 in patients previously treated with basiliximab suggest that subsequent use of muromonab-CD3 
or other murine anti-lymphocytic antibody preparations is not precluded. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Adults 
Single-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in adult patients 
undergoing kidney transplantation. Cumulative doses ranged from 20 mg up to 60 mg. Peak serum 
concentration following intravenous infusion of 20 mg over 30 minutes is 7.15.1 mg/l. There is a 
proportional increase in Cmax and AUC from 20 mg to 60 mg, the range of single-dose administrations 
tested. The volume of distribution at steady state was 8.64.1 l. The extent and degree of distribution 
to various body compartments have not been fully studied. In vitro studies using human tissues 
indicate that basiliximab binds only to activated lymphocytes and macrophages/monocytes. The 
terminal half-life was 7.23.2 days. Total body clearance was 4119 ml/h. 
No clinically relevant influence of body weight or gender on distribution volume or clearance has been 
observed in adult patients. Elimination half-life was not influenced by age, gender, or race. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of basiliximab were assessed in 39 paediatric de novo renal transplantation 
patients. In infants and children (age 1–11 years, n=25), the steady-state distribution volume was 
4.82.1 l, half-life was 9.54.5 days and clearance was 176 ml/h. Distribution volume and clearance 
are reduced by about 50% compared to adult renal transplantation patients. Disposition parameters 
were not influenced to a clinically relevant extent by age (1–11 years), body weight (9–37 kg) or body 
surface area (0.44–1.20 m) in this age group. In adolescents (age 12–16 years, n=14), the steady-state 
distribution volume was 7.85.1 l, half-life was 9.13.9 days and clearance was 3119 ml/h. 
Disposition in adolescents was similar to that in adult renal transplantation patients. The relationship 
between serum concentration and receptor saturation was assessed in 13 patients and was similar to 
that characterised in adult renal transplantation patients. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No toxicity was observed when rhesus monkeys received intravenous doses of either up to 5 mg/kg 
basiliximab twice weekly for 4 weeks followed by an 8-week withdrawal period or 24 mg/kg 
basiliximab weekly for 39 weeks followed by a 13-week withdrawal period. In the 39-week study, the 
highest dose resulted in approximately 1,000 times the systemic exposure (AUC) observed in patients 
given the recommended clinical dose together with concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. 
No maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, or teratogenicity was observed in cynomolgous monkeys 
following injections of up to 5 mg/kg basiliximab administered twice weekly during the organogenesis 
period. 
No mutagenic potential was observed in vitro.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Simulect is and what it is used for 
Simulect belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants. It is given in hospital to adults, 
adolescents and children who are having a kidney transplant. Immunosuppressants reduce the body’s 
response to anything that it sees as “foreign” – which includes transplanted organs. The body’s 
immune system thinks a transplanted organ is a foreign body and will try to reject it. Simulect works 
by stopping the immune cells that attack transplanted organs. 
You will only be given two doses of Simulect. These will be given in hospital, around the time of your 
transplant operation. Simulect is given to stop your body from rejecting the new organ during the first 
4 to 6 weeks after the transplant operation, when rejection is most likely. You will be given other 
medicines to help protect your new kidney during this time, such as ciclosporin and corticosteroids 
and after you leave hospital. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Simulect 
Follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. If you are unsure about anything, ask your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist. 
You must not be given Simulect 
- 
if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to basiliximab or any of the other ingredients of Simulect 
listed in section 6 under “What Simulect contains”. Tell your doctor if you suspect you may 
have had an allergic reaction to any of these ingredients in the past. 
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Simulect: 
- 
- 
if you have previously received a transplant that failed after only a short time or, 
if you have previously been in the operating theatre for a transplantation that in the end was not 
performed. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this situation, you may have received Simulect. Your doctor will check this for you and discuss 
with you the possibility of repeated treatment with Simulect. 
If you need to have a vaccination, seek your doctor’s advice first. 
Other medicines and Simulect 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Older patients (aged 65 years and over) 
Simulect can be given to older patients, but the information available is limited. Your doctor may 
discuss this with you before you are given Simulect. 
Children and adolescents (aged 1 to 17 years) 
Simulect can be given to children and adolescents. The dose for children who weigh less than 35 kg will 
be smaller than the dose usually given to adults. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
It is very important to tell your doctor before your transplant if you are pregnant or you think that you 
may be pregnant. You must not be given Simulect if you are pregnant. You must use adequate 
contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment and up to 4 months after receiving the last dose 
of Simulect. If you become pregnant during this time, despite the use of contraceptive measures, you 
should tell your doctor immediately. 
You should also tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Simulect may harm your baby. You must 
not breast-feed after being given Simulect or up to 4 months after the second dose. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or 
breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
There is no evidence to indicate that Simulect has an effect on your ability to drive a car or use 
machines. 
Simulect contains sodium and potassium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
3. 
How Simulect is given 
You will only be given Simulect if you are receiving a new kidney. Simulect is given twice, in 
hospital, either slowly through a needle in your vein as an infusion lasting 20–30 minutes or as an 
intravenous injection using a syringe. 
If you have experienced a severe allergic reaction to Simulect or if you had complications after your 
surgery such as graft loss, the second dose of Simulect should not be given to you. 
The first dose is given just before the transplant operation, and the second dose 4 days after the 
operation. 
Usual dose for adults 
The usual dose for adults is 20 mg in each infusion or injection. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Usual dose for children and adolescents (aged 1 to 17 years) 
- 
For children and adolescents who weigh 35 kg or more, the dose of Simulect given in each 
infusion or injection is 20 mg. 
For children and adolescents who weigh less than 35 kg, the dose of Simulect given in each 
infusion or injection is 10 mg. 
- 
If you are given too much Simulect 
An overdose of Simulect is not likely to cause side effects straight away, but it may weaken your 
immune system for longer. Your doctor will watch out for any effects on your immune system and 
treat them if necessary. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Tell your doctor or nurse as soon as possible if you get any unexpected symptoms while you are 
being given Simulect, or during the 8 weeks afterwards, even if you do not think that they are related 
to the medicine. 
Sudden severe allergic reactions have been reported in patients treated with Simulect. If you notice 
sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or 
other parts of the body, fast heart beat, dizziness, light headedness, shortness of breath, sneezing, 
wheezing or trouble breathing, severely decreased urine output, or fever and flu-like symptoms, tell 
your doctor or nurse immediately. 
In adults, the most commonly reported side effects were constipation, nausea, diarrhoea, weight 
increase, headache, pain, swelling of hands, ankles or feet, high blood pressure, anaemia, changes in 
blood chemistry (e.g. potassium, cholesterol, phosphate, creatinine), surgical wound complications, 
and various kinds of infections. 
In children, the most commonly reported side effects were constipation, excessive growth of normal 
hair, runny or blocked nose, fever, high blood pressure, and various kinds of infections. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RECONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Simulect must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will receive the 
graft and concomitant immunosuppression. 
To prepare the solution for infusion or injection, add 5 ml water for injections from the accompanying 
ampoule to the vial containing the Simulect powder, using aseptic technique. Shake the vial gently to 
dissolve the powder, avoiding foaming. It is recommended that after reconstitution the colourless, 
clear to opalescent solution should be used immediately. Reconstituted products should be inspected 
visually for particulate matter prior to administration. Do not use if foreign particles are present. After 
reconstitution, chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C 
or for 4 hours at room temperature. Discard the reconstituted solution if not used within that time. 
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user. 
Reconstituted Simulect is administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 to 30 minutes or as a bolus 
injection. The reconstituted solution is isotonic. For infusion, the reconstituted solution should be 
diluted to a volume of 50 ml or greater with normal saline or dextrose 50 mg/ml (5%). The first dose 
should be given within 2 hours before transplantation surgery, and the second dose 4 days after 
transplantation. The second dose should not be given if severe hypersensitivity reactions to 
Simulect or graft loss occur. 
Since no data are available on the compatibility of Simulect with other intravenous substances, 
Simulect should not be mixed with other medications/substances and should always be given through 
a separate infusion line. 
Compatibility with the following infusion sets has been verified:

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Simulect is and what it is used for 
Simulect belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants. It is given in hospital to adults, 
adolescents and children who are having a kidney transplant. Immunosuppressants reduce the body’s 
response to anything that it sees as “foreign” – which includes transplanted organs. The body’s 
immune system thinks a transplanted organ is a foreign body and will try to reject it. Simulect works 
by stopping the immune cells that attack transplanted organs. 
You will only be given two doses of Simulect. These will be given in hospital, around the time of your 
transplant operation. Simulect is given to stop your body from rejecting the new organ during the first 
4 to 6 weeks after the transplant operation, when rejection is most likely. You will be given other 
medicines to help protect your new kidney during this time, such as ciclosporin and corticosteroids 
and after you leave hospital. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Simulect 
Follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. If you are unsure about anything, ask your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist. 
You must not be given Simulect 
- 
if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to basiliximab or any of the other ingredients of Simulect 
listed in section 6 under “What Simulect contains”. Tell your doctor if you suspect you may 
have had an allergic reaction to any of these ingredients in the past. 
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Simulect: 
- 
- 
if you have previously received a transplant that failed after only a short time or, 
if you have previously been in the operating theatre for a transplantation that in the end was not 
performed. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this situation, you may have received Simulect. Your doctor will check this for you and discuss 
with you the possibility of repeated treatment with Simulect. 
If you need to have a vaccination, seek your doctor’s advice first. 
Other medicines and Simulect 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Older patients (aged 65 years and over) 
Simulect can be given to older patients, but the information available is limited. Your doctor may 
discuss this with you before you are given Simulect. 
Children and adolescents (aged 1 to 17 years) 
Simulect can be given to children and adolescents. The dose for children who weigh less than 35 kg will 
be smaller than the dose usually given to adults. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
It is very important to tell your doctor before your transplant if you are pregnant or you think that you 
may be pregnant. You must not be given Simulect if you are pregnant. You must use adequate 
contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment and up to 4 months after receiving the last dose 
of Simulect. If you become pregnant during this time, despite the use of contraceptive measures, you 
should tell your doctor immediately. 
You should also tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Simulect may harm your baby. You must 
not breast-feed after being given Simulect or up to 4 months after the second dose. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or 
breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
There is no evidence to indicate that Simulect has an effect on your ability to drive a car or use 
machines. 
Simulect contains sodium and potassium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
3. 
How Simulect is given 
You will only be given Simulect if you are receiving a new kidney. Simulect is given twice, in 
hospital, either slowly through a needle in your vein as an infusion lasting 20–30 minutes or as an 
intravenous injection using a syringe. 
If you have experienced a severe allergic reaction to Simulect or if you had complications after your 
surgery such as graft loss, the second dose of Simulect should not be given to you. 
The first dose is given just before the transplant operation, and the second dose 4 days after the 
operation. 
Usual dose for adults 
The usual dose for adults is 20 mg in each infusion or injection. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Usual dose for children and adolescents (aged 1 to 17 years) 
- 
For children and adolescents who weigh 35 kg or more, the dose of Simulect given in each 
infusion or injection is 20 mg. 
For children and adolescents who weigh less than 35 kg, the dose of Simulect given in each 
infusion or injection is 10 mg. 
- 
If you are given too much Simulect 
An overdose of Simulect is not likely to cause side effects straight away, but it may weaken your 
immune system for longer. Your doctor will watch out for any effects on your immune system and 
treat them if necessary. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Tell your doctor or nurse as soon as possible if you get any unexpected symptoms while you are 
being given Simulect, or during the 8 weeks afterwards, even if you do not think that they are related 
to the medicine. 
Sudden severe allergic reactions have been reported in patients treated with Simulect. If you notice 
sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or 
other parts of the body, fast heart beat, dizziness, light headedness, shortness of breath, sneezing, 
wheezing or trouble breathing, severely decreased urine output, or fever and flu-like symptoms, tell 
your doctor or nurse immediately. 
In adults, the most commonly reported side effects were constipation, nausea, diarrhoea, weight 
increase, headache, pain, swelling of hands, ankles or feet, high blood pressure, anaemia, changes in 
blood chemistry (e.g. potassium, cholesterol, phosphate, creatinine), surgical wound complications, 
and various kinds of infections. 
In children, the most commonly reported side effects were constipation, excessive growth of normal 
hair, runny or blocked nose, fever, high blood pressure, and various kinds of infections. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RECONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Simulect must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will receive the 
graft and concomitant immunosuppression. 
To prepare the solution for infusion or injection, add 5 ml water for injections compliant with the 
European Pharmacopoeia and without any additives to the vial containing the Simulect powder, using 
aseptic technique. Shake the vial gently to dissolve the powder, avoiding foaming. It is recommended 
that after reconstitution the colourless, clear to opalescent solution should be used immediately. 
Reconstituted products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration. Do 
not use if foreign particles are present. After reconstitution, chemical and physical in-use stability has 
been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C or for 4 hours at room temperature. Discard the 
reconstituted solution if not used within that time. From a microbiological point of view, the product 
should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use 
are the responsibility of the user. 
Reconstituted Simulect is administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 to 30 minutes or as a bolus 
injection. The reconstituted solution is isotonic. For infusion, the reconstituted solution should be 
diluted to a volume of 50 ml or greater with normal saline or dextrose 50 mg/ml (5%). The first dose 
should be given within 2 hours before transplantation surgery, and the second dose 4 days after 
transplantation. The second dose should not be given if severe hypersensitivity reactions to 
Simulect or graft loss occur. 
Since no data are available on the compatibility of Simulect with other intravenous substances, 
Simulect should not be mixed with other medications/substances and should always be given through 
a separate infusion line.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RECONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Simulect 10 mg must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will 
receive the graft and concomitant immunosuppression. 
To prepare the solution for infusion or injection, take 2.5 ml water for injections out of the 
accompanying 5 ml ampoule aseptically and add this 2.5 ml water for injections to the vial containing 
the Simulect powder, using aseptic technique. Shake the vial gently to dissolve the powder, avoiding 
foaming. It is recommended that after reconstitution the colourless, clear to opalescent solution should 
be used immediately. Reconstituted products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior 
to administration. Do not use if foreign particles are present. After reconstitution, chemical and 
physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C or for 4 hours at room 
temperature. Discard the reconstituted solution if not used within that time. From a microbiological 
point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times 
and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user. 
Reconstituted Simulect is administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 to 30 minutes or as a bolus 
injection. The reconstituted solution is isotonic. For infusion, the reconstituted solution should be 
diluted to a volume of 25 ml or greater with normal saline or dextrose 50 mg/ml (5%). The first dose 
should be given within 2 hours before transplantation surgery, and the second dose 4 days after 
transplantation. The second dose should not be given if severe hypersensitivity reactions to 
Simulect or graft loss occur. 
Since no data are available on the compatibility of Simulect with other intravenous substances, 
Simulect should not be mixed with other medications/substances and should always be given through 
a separate infusion line. 
Compatibility with the following infusion sets has been verified:

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Simulect is and what it is used for 
Simulect belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants. It is given in hospital to adults, 
adolescents and children who are having a kidney transplant. Immunosuppressants reduce the body’s 
response to anything that it sees as “foreign” – which includes transplanted organs. The body’s 
immune system thinks a transplanted organ is a foreign body and will try to reject it. Simulect works 
by stopping the immune cells that attack transplanted organs. 
You will only be given two doses of Simulect. These will be given in hospital, around the time of your 
transplant operation. Simulect is given to stop your body from rejecting the new organ during the first 
4 to 6 weeks after the transplant operation, when rejection is most likely. You will be given other 
medicines to help protect your new kidney during this time, such as ciclosporin and corticosteroids 
and after you leave hospital. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Simulect 
Follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. If you are unsure about anything, ask your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist. 
You must not be given Simulect 
- 
if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to basiliximab or any of the other ingredients of Simulect 
listed in section 6 under “What Simulect contains”. Tell your doctor if you suspect you may 
have had an allergic reaction to any of these ingredients in the past. 
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Simulect: 
- 
- 
if you have previously received a transplant that failed after only a short time or, 
if you have previously been in the operating theatre for a transplantation that in the end was not 
performed. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this situation, you may have received Simulect. Your doctor will check this for you and discuss 
with you the possibility of repeated treatment with Simulect. 
If you need to have a vaccination, seek your doctor’s advice first. 
Other medicines and Simulect 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Older patients (aged 65 years and over) 
Simulect can be given to older patients, but the information available is limited. Your doctor may 
discuss this with you before you are given Simulect. 
Children and adolescents (aged 1 to 17 years) 
Simulect can be given to children and adolescents. The dose for children who weigh less than 35 kg will 
be smaller than the dose usually given to adults. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
It is very important to tell your doctor before your transplant if you are pregnant or you think that you 
may be pregnant. You must not be given Simulect if you are pregnant. You must use adequate 
contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment and up to 4 months after receiving the last dose 
of Simulect. If you become pregnant during this time, despite the use of contraceptive measures, you 
should tell your doctor immediately. 
You should also tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Simulect may harm your baby. You must 
not breast-feed after being given Simulect or up to 4 months after the second dose. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or 
breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
There is no evidence to indicate that Simulect has an effect on your ability to drive a car or use 
machines. 
Simulect contains sodium and potassium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
3. 
How Simulect is given 
You will only be given Simulect if you are receiving a new kidney. Simulect is given twice, in 
hospital, either slowly through a needle in your vein as an infusion lasting 20–30 minutes or as an 
intravenous injection using a syringe. 
If you have experienced a severe allergic reaction to Simulect or if you had complications after your 
surgery such as graft loss, the second dose of Simulect should not be given to you. 
The first dose is given just before the transplant operation, and the second dose 4 days after the 
operation. 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Usual dose for children and adolescents (aged 1 to 17 years) 
- 
For children and adolescents who weigh less than 35 kg, the dose of Simulect given in each 
infusion or injection is 10 mg. 
For children and adolescents who weigh 35 kg or more, the dose of Simulect given in each 
infusion or injection is 20 mg. 
- 
Usual dose for adults 
The usual dose for adults is 20 mg in each infusion or injection. 
If you are given too much Simulect 
An overdose of Simulect is not likely to cause side effects straight away, but it may weaken your 
immune system for longer. Your doctor will watch out for any effects on your immune system and 
treat them if necessary. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Tell your doctor or nurse as soon as possible if you get any unexpected symptoms while you are 
being given Simulect, or during the 8 weeks afterwards, even if you do not think that they are related 
to the medicine. 
Sudden severe allergic reactions have been reported in patients treated with Simulect. If you notice 
sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or 
other parts of the body, fast heart beat, dizziness, light headedness, shortness of breath, sneezing, 
wheezing or trouble breathing, severely decreased urine output, or fever and flu-like symptoms, tell 
your doctor or nurse immediately. 
In children, the most commonly reported side effects were constipation, excessive growth of normal 
hair, runny or blocked nose, fever, high blood pressure, and various kinds of infections. 
In adults, the most commonly reported side effects were constipation, nausea, diarrhoea, weight 
increase, headache, pain, swelling of hands, ankles or feet, high blood pressure, anaemia, changes in 
blood chemistry (e.g. potassium, cholesterol, phosphate, creatinine), surgical wound complications, 
and various kinds of infections. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
5.

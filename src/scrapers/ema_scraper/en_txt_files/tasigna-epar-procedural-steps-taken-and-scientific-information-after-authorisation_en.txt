As part of this update, the safety pool was substantially 
C.I.4: Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to 
update the ADRs frequency category based on 
pooled safety data from 13 interventional clinical 
studies, 5 of which have not been previously 
assessed (CAMN107A2303 - 120 months data; 
CAMN107A2404; CAMN107E2401; CAMN107ECN02 
and CAMN107EIC01). 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to merge 
the current 2 SmPCs (one for 150mg and one for 
50mg/200mg) into one single SmPC, by including all 
information from the 150mg SmPC into the 
50mg/200mg SmPC; and to implement editorial 
changes. The Package Leaflet is proposed to be 
updated accordingly.

data from 3,422 patients treated with Tasigna in 13 clinical 
studies in the approved indications: adults and paediatric 
patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome 
positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the 
chronic phase (5 clinical studies with 2,414 patients), adult 
patients with chronic phase and accelerated phase 
Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with resistance or 
intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib (6 clinical 
studies with 939 patients) and paediatric patients with 
chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with 
resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib 
(2 clinical studies with 69 patients). These pooled data 
represents 9,039.34 patient-years of exposure. 
The safety profile of nilotinib is consistent across 
indications. 
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥15%) 
from the pooled safety data were: rash (26.4%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (including pharyngitis, 
nasopharyngitis, rhinitis) (24.8%) headache (21.9%), 
hyperbilirubinaemia (including blood bilirubin increased) 
(18.6%), arthralgia (15.8%), fatigue (15.4%), nausea 
(16.8%), pruritus (16.7%) and thrombocytopenia (16.4%).

Update of SmPC sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 based on the

28/03/2022 
SmPC, Annex 
The product information has been updated with the final 
5-year follow up data from the study CAMN107A2203 
in paediatric patients. Annex II D has been updated 
to reflect the fulfilment of the obligation to conduct 
the post authorisation efficacy study (PAES). The 
Package leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, 
the Tasigna EU RMP version 25 has been updated to 
remove the corresponding additional 
pharmacovigilance activity and the missing 
information ‘Long-term follow-up in paediatric 
patients’. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
II and PL 
results of the mentioned paediatric study.  
CAMN107A2203 was a Phase II, open-label, multi-center 
study evaluating the efficacy and safety of nilotinib 230 
mg/m2 twice daily conducted in 58 pediatric patients with 
Ph+ CML (33 patients were resistant or intolerant to 
imatinib or dasatinib, and 25 patients were newly 
diagnosed). 
The results provided with this final five-year data are 
clinically relevant, are in line with the previous observed 
effects and also confirm the long-term efficacy.  
As for the updated safety this is in general consistent with 
the known safety profile of nilotinib established in adult 
patients with Ph+ CML-CP dosed at 400 mg b.i.d. Some 
issues are identified; increases of transaminases and 
bilirubin as well as the incidence of bilirubin elevation based 
on laboratory assessments were more common observed in 
pediatric population. Paediatric CML-CP patients should be 
monitored for hepatic safety and the nilotinib dose adjusted 
or interrupted as needed 
The risk of growth retardation in the paediatric population 
is still present and has been further elucidated in the 
product information. However, the therapeutic benefit of 
treating CML in pediatric patients outweighs the risk of 
growth and development effects. This is also considered an 
important identified risk in the risk management plan.

with BCR-ABL1-positive CML-CP who achieved a 
sustained molecular response of MR4.5 on nilotinib 
treatment after switching from imatinib to nilotinib.  
Consequently, the RMP (version) 23 is being updated 
to remove the additional pharmacovigilance activity 
'collection and submission of data on late relapses 
from the ongoing studies ENESTfreedom 
(CAMN107I2201) and ENESTop (CAMN107A2408)'

daily for 12 days increased the systemic exposure (AUC 
and Cmax) of oral midazolam (a substrate of CYP3A4) 2.6 
fold and 2.0 fold, respectively. Nilotinib is a moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor. As a result, the systemic exposure of 
other drugs primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. certain 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) may be increased when co-
administered with nilotinib. Appropriate monitoring and 
dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that are 
CYP3A4 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic index 
(including but not limited to alfentanil, cyclosporine, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, sirolimus and 
tacrolimus) when co-administered with nilotinib.

Severe forms of fluid retention such as pleural effusion, 
pulmonary oedema, and pericardial effusion were 
uncommonly (0.1 to 1%) observed in a Phase III study of 
newly diagnosed CML patients. Similar events were 
observed in post-marketing reports. Unexpected, rapid 
weight gain should be carefully investigated. If signs of 
severe fluid retention appear during treatment with 
nilotinib, the aetiology should be evaluated and patients 
treated accordingly (see section 4.2 for instructions on 
managing non-haematological toxicities). 
Cardiovascular events 
Cardiovascular events were reported in a randomised Phase 
III study in newly diagnosed CML patients and observed in

post-marketing reports. In this clinical study with a median 
on-therapy time of 48 months, Grade 3 4 cases of 
cardiovascular events included peripheral arterial occlusive 
disease (1.1% and 0.4% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib 
twice daily, respectively), ischemic heart disease (2.2% 
and 3.2% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, 
respectively) and ischemic cerebrovascular events (0.7% 
and 1.4% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, 
respectively). Patients should be advised to seek immediate 
medical attention if they experience acute signs or 
symptoms of cardiovascular events. The cardiovascular 
status of patients should be evaluated and cardiovascular 
risk factors monitored and actively managed during Tasigna 
therapy according to standard guidelines. Appropriate 
therapy should be prescribed to manage cardiovascular risk 
factors (see section 4.2 for instructions on managing non-
haematological toxicities).

leaflet with information regarding tumour lysis 
syndrome. The MAH also took the opportunity to 
update the contact details of the local 
representatives in Poland and Romania in the

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
with Tasigna. TLS is at increased risk of occurring in 
patients with high tumour burden with or without specific 
tumour therapy. Tumour therapy is likely to increase the 
risk of TLS. Dehydration and baseline high uric acid levels 
also increase the risk of TLS. Consequently, in patients at 
increased risk of TLS and in patients whose malignancy is 
sensitive to Tasigna therapy, the potential exists for TLS to 
occur with Tasigna therapy. 
Therefore, a warning has been included in the product 
information of Tasigna to indicated that, due to possible 
occurrence of TLS, correction of clinically significant 
dehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are 
recommended prior to initiating therapy with Tasigna. 
This adverse reaction has also been included with a rare

study report for CAMN107A2101 was requested with 
FUM 032 and FUM033. In addition, a correction to 
SmPC section 4.4 has been introduced based on 
these follow-up data. Section 4 of the package leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. The MAH also took 
the opportunity to update the list of local

a clinical trial with a Phase IA dose escalation study and a 
Phase II dose expansion study in imatinib-
resistant/intolerant Philadelphia chromosome positive 
chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase 
(CP) and accelerated phase (AP). The primary endpoints 
were Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) (? 35% Ph+) for 
CML-CP and confirmed Hematologic Response (HR) for 
CML-AP. 
The MAH now provided the 24-months follow up safety and 
efficacy data from the Phase II study CAMN107A2101. The 
data now reflect exposure to Tasigna in 458 patients, 321 
patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in CP and 
137 patients in AP treated at the recommended dose of 400 
mg twice daily. The median duration of exposure in days 
was 561 (1 1,096) for the CML-CP patients and 264 (2

clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
1,160) for the CML-AP patients. 
Chronic Phase 
The MCyR rate in 321 CP patients was 51%. Most 
responders achieved their MCyR rapidly within 3 months 
(median 2.8 months) of starting Tasigna treatment and 
these were sustained. Of the patients who achieved MCyR, 
77% (95% CI: 70% - 84%) were maintaining response at 
24 months. Patients with a Complete Hematological 
Response (CHR) at baseline achieved a MCyR faster (1.9 
vs. 2.8 months). Of CP patients without a baseline CHR, 
70% achieved a CHR, median time to CHR was 1 month 
and median duration of CHR was 32.8 months. The 
estimated 24-month overall survival rate in CML-CP 
patients was 87%. 
Accelerated Phase 
The overall confirmed HR rate in 137 AP patients was 50 
%. Most responders achieved a HR early with Tasigna 
treatment (median 1.0 months) and these have been 
durable (median duration of confirmed HR was 24.2 
months). Of the patients who achieved HR, 53% (95% CI: 
39% - 67%) were maintaining response at 24 months. The 
estimated 24-month overall survival rate in CML-AP 
patients was 70%.

nilotinib did not result in any changes in warfarin 
pharmacokinetic parameters or warfarin 
pharmacodynamics measured as prothrombin time (PT) 
and international normalised ratio (INR). There are no 
steady-state data. This study suggests that a clinically 
meaningful drug-drug interaction between nilotinib and 
warfarin is less likely up to a dose of 25 mg of warfarin. 
Due to lack of steady-state data, control of warfarin 
pharmacodynamic markers (INR or PT) following initiation 
of nilotinib therapy (at least during the first 2 weeks) is 
recommended.

pump inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral 
dose of Tasigna (nilotinib) in healthy subjects and the 
secondary objective to assess the safety and tolerability of 
a single oral dose of nilotinib given alone and concomitantly 
with esomeprazole in healthy subjects.  
In healthy subjects receiving esomeprazole at 40 mg once 
daily for 5 days, gastric pH was markedly increased, but 
nilotinib absorption was only decreased modestly (27% 
decrease in Cmax and 34% decrease in AUC0-?).  
The CHMP agreed that the study results suggest a modest 
reduction in the rate and extent of nilotinib absorption 
when co-administered with esomeprazole. Such an effect is 
unlikely to have clinically significant consequences for 
nilotinib therapy. Nilotinib can be used with esomeprazole 
or other proton pump inhibitors as needed. 
The Product Information has been updated accordingly.

conducted a review further to reports of overdose. Based 
on the available information, the MAH proposed to change 
section 4.9 Overdose of the SPC as follows: 
"Isolated reports of intentional overdose with nilotinib were 
reported, where an unspecified number of Tasigna capsules 
were ingested in combination with alcohol and other 
medicinal products. Events included neutropenia, vomiting 
and drowsiness. No ECG changes or hepatotoxicity were 
reported. Outcomes were reported as recovered. In the 
event of overdose, the patient should be observed and

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SPC) further to cases of 
sudden death. The Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH) also took the opportunity to correct sections 
4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC where moxifloxacin was listed 
as a medicinal product inhibiting CYP3A4 instead of a 
medicinal product that may prolong QT. The Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Minor editorial 
changes have also been made to the SPC and

2006, at which time the Marketing Authorisation Holder of 
Tasigna (nilotinib) had received 6 reports of sudden and/or 
unexpected deaths in patients in clinical trials of nilotinib. 
Further to a cumulative review, a total of 14 cases of 
sudden cardiac deaths have been identified from clinical 
trials and compassionate use programs up to the cut-off 
date of 31 January 2009. 
The CHMP considered that all fourteen cases identified as 
sudden cardiac death involve patients who had cardiac 
disease, either known at the time of study entry or as 
determined upon autopsy, or who had significant cardiac 
risk factors. For six of the 14 cases, a causal role for 
nilotinib could not be ruled out.  
Therefore, the following warning was added to section 4.4 
of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) of 
Tasigna: 
"Sudden Death 
Uncommon cases (0.1 to 1%) of sudden deaths have been 
reported in patients receiving Tasigna with a past medical 
history of cardiac disease or significant cardiac risk factors. 
Comorbidities in addition to the underlying malignancy 
were also frequently present as were concomitant 
medications. Ventricular repolarization abnormalities may 
have been contributory factors."

Myelosuppression was a common finding with Tasigna. 
Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia were the 
most frequently reported grade 3 and 4 laboratory 
abnormalities in the core safety patient population of the 
initial marketing authorisation application.  
Myelosuppression is an identified risk in the Tasigna Risk 
Management Plan and is continuously monitored. 
The current Summary of Product Characteristics already 
includes events indicative of myelosuppression including 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, febrile

A phase I multicenter, dose escalation study of AMN107 in 
combination with imatinib on a continuous daily dosing 
schedule in adult patients with imatinib-resistant 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) was conducted. 
The results of this study showed that concomitant 
administration of nilotinib with imatinib (a substrate and 
moderator of Pgp and CYP3A4), had a slight inhibitory 
effect on CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. The AUC of imatinib was 
increased by 18% to 39%, and the AUC of nilotinib was 
increased by 18% to 40%. These changes are unlikely to 
be clinically important. 
This study also showed that nilotinib absorption (relative 
bioavailability) might be reduced by approximately 48% 
and 22% in patients with total gastrectomy and partial 
gastrectomy, respectively.

authorisation, the marketing authorisation holder made the 
commitment to assess the pharmacokinetics of Tasigna 
(nilotinib) in subjects with impaired hepatic function and 
healthy subjects with normal hepatic function (FUM 016). 
A phase I, single-center, open-label, single oral dose, 
parallel study was conducted to assess the 
pharmacokinetics of 200 mg of nilotinib in subjects with 
impaired hepatic function and healthy subjects with normal 
hepatic function. 
The results of this study showed that hepatic impairment 
has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib. 
Single dose administration of 200 mg of nilotinib resulted in 
increases in AUC of 35%, 35% and 19% in patients with 
mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment 
respectively, compared to a control group of subjects with 
normal hepatic function. No obvious association between 
degree of hepatic impairment and exposure has been 
shown.  
The predicted steady-state Cmax of nilotinib showed an 
increase of 29%, 18% and 22% respectively. 
Cmax exposure appears significantly lower in subjects with 
hepatic impairment and with an apparent association to the 
degree of hepatic impairment. This is unlikely to be of 
clinical relevance.

dose of rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) on the pharmacokinetics 
of a single 400 mg oral dose of AMN107 in healthy subjects 
(FUM 009). 
This study showed that rifampicin, a potent CYP3A inducer 
decreases nilotinib Cmax by 64 % and reduces nilotinib 
AUC by 80%. The CHMP considered that rifampicin and 
nilotinib should not be used concomitantly and that other 
medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 are likewise likely to 
reduce exposure to nilotinib to a clinically relevant extent.

Marketing Authorisation Holder committed to conduct an 
oral pre- and postnatal development (Segment III) study in 
rats (FUM 008). 
Further to the request from the CHMP following the 
assessment of FUM 008, section 5.3 of the SPC has been 
updated to reflect the key findings of this study, as follows: 
Nilotinib did not induce teratogenicity, but did show 
embryo- and foetotoxicity at doses that also showed 
maternal toxicity. Increased post-implantation loss was 
observed in both the fertility study, which involved 
treatment of both males and females, and the 
embryotoxicity study, which involved treatment of females. 
Embryo-lethality and foetal effects (mainly decreased foetal 
weights, premature fusion of the facial bones (fused 
maxilla/zygomatic), visceral and skeletal variations) in rats 
and increased resorption of foetuses and skeletal variations 
in rabbits were present in the embryotoxicity studies. In a 
pre- and postnatal development study in rats, maternal 
exposure to nilotinib caused reduced pup body weight with 
associated changes in physical development parameters as 
well as reduced mating and fertility indices in the offspring. 
Exposure to nilotinib in females at No-Observed-Adverse-
Effect-Levels was generally less or equal to that in humans 
at 800 mg/day.

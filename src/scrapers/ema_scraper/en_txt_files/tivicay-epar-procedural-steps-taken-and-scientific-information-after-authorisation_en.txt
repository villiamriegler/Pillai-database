Following the finalisation of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/WS1810 concerning submission of 
EuroSIDA (category 3 PASS) study, this Type II 
worksharing variation was proposed to address the 
removal of three important risks (Dolutegravir

Hypersensitivity reactions, Hepatobiliary reactions 
and Serious rash) from all four dolutegravir-
containing product EU-RMPs; Tivicay (dolutegravir), 
Triumeq (dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine), Dovato 
(dolutegravir/lamivudine) and Juluca 
(dolutegravir/rilpivirine) - i.e. deletion of safety 
concerns.  
In addition, the MAH took opportunity to propose a 
harmonisation of the risks across all four 
dolutegravir-containing product EU-RMPs and other 
minor updates (including study details and 
epidemiology data). 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed 
amendments to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

finalisation of PSUSA procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010075/202101 (reporting 
period 17 Jan 2020 to 16 Jan 2021) based on reports 
of completed suicide from participants exposed to 
dolutegravir containing regimen in ViiV Healthcare-
sponsored clinical trials. As the changes impact all 
dolutegravir containing products, the MAH submitted 
a worksharing procedure to include 
Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (Juluca) product in 
accordance with Article 20 (worksharing procedure) 
of Commission Regulation (EC) 1234/2008. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in section 4 with a rather 
identical wording.  
The proposed wording should be as follows (identical 
with the suggested wording by the MAH regarding 
Dovato (footnote instead of brackets for the 
explanatory wording is acceptable to be in line with 
already included footnote on suicidal ideation and 
suicide attempt), Triumeq and Juluca. Nevertheless, 
the wording in section 4 for Tivicay is not exactly the 
same as for the other three products and should be 
therefore adapted accordingly).  
Furthermore, it could be considered to add a 
statement for patients in section of the PL that they 
should consult their doctor especially if 
neuropsychiatric side effects occur, since only under 
this condition an adequate reaction by the HCPs 
(knowledge of the adverse effects) is possible.

focusing on the safety of antiretroviral therapy during 
pregnancy and was designed to evaluate adverse birth 
outcomes by HIV status and antiretroviral regimen. 
The assessment of the latest results (July 2020) from the 
study shows a small increase of neural tube defects; 7 
cases in 3,591 deliveries (0.19%; 95% CI 0.09%, 0.40%)

DTG regimens at the time of conception. 
The SmPC has been updated to include advice for women 
of childbearing potential to be counselled about the 
potential risk of NTD with DTG, including consideration of 
effective contraceptive measures. 
In addition, a recommendation to discuss the benefits and 
risks of continuing DTG versus switching to another 
antiretroviral regimen has been added in the case when a 
pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester while on DTG.

to add a new contraindication in relation to the co-
administration of dolutegravir with medicinal 
products with narrow therapeutic windows that are 
substrates of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), 
including but not limited to fampridine (also known 
as dalfampridine).The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the products information 
have been updated to reflect the following changes: 
- 
remove the drug-drug interactions for 
products no longer authorised in the EU (boceprevir, 
dofetilide, nelfinavir) 
- 
remove the inverted triangle for additional 
monitoring for Dovato only.  
Editorial changes have been made to the product 
information. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list 
of local representatives in the Package Leaflets. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
for dolutegravir containing products namely dolutegravir 
(DTG; TIVICAY), dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine 
(DTG/ABC/3TC; TRIUMEQ), dolutegravir/rilpivirine fixed 
dose combination (DTG/RPV FDC; JULUCA), and 
dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC; DOVATO), to warn of 
concurrent administration of dolutegravir with medicinal 
products with narrow therapeutic windows, that are 
substrates of OCT-2, including but not limited to fampridine 
(also known as dalfampridine).  
Fampridine is a substrate of OCT2 with a narrow 
therapeutic index and could show an increased risk of 
seizures at elevated concentrations. 
While the proposed interaction has not been formally 
investigated in a drug interaction study for dolutegravir, 
the contradiction is accepted given the information stated 
in the approved product labelling for fampridine, and the 
understanding of dolutegravir potential to inhibit OCT2. 
The SmPC section 4.3 and 4.5 and the PL have been 
updated accordingly.

HIV-1 infected antiretroviral naïve subjects were 
randomised to either a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir 50 
mg plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily, or to a three-drug 
regimen of dolutegravir 50 mg once daily with fixed dose 
TDF/FTC. Subjects were enrolled with a screening plasma 
HIV-1 RNA of 1000 c/mL to ≤500,000 c/mL. At baseline, in 
the pooled analysis, median patient age was 33 years, 15% 
were female, 32% non-white, 6% had hepatitis C co-
infection and 9% were CDC Stage 3. Approximately one 
third of the patients were infected with an HIV non-B 
subtype; these characteristics were similar between 
treatment groups. Virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 
copies/mL) in the dolutegravir plus lamivudine group was 
non-inferior to the dolutegravir plus TDF/FTC group at 48 
weeks. The results of the pooled analysis were in line with 
those of the individual studies, for which the primary 
endpoint (difference in proportion <50 copies/mL plasma 
HIV-1 RNA at week 48 based on the Snapshot algorithm) 
was met. The adjusted difference was -2.6% (95% CI: -
6.7; 1.5) for GEMINI-1 and -0.7% (95% CI: -4.3; 2.9) for 
GEMINI-2 with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 
10%. 
Through 48 weeks in the GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies, 
no cases of emergent resistance to the integrase- or NRTI-
class were seen in either the DTG+3TC or comparator 
DTG+ TDF/FTC arms. 
There are no data available on the use of dolutegravir plus 
lamivudine as a two-drug regimen in paediatric patients.

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with week-48 
results (end of study) from Phase III Study 
ING116529 in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-
experienced, INI-resistant subjects and update of 
section 5.1 of the SmPC with combined analyses of 
antiviral response at Week 24 and Week 48 by IN 
genotype and DTG phenotype in treatment-
experienced, INI-resistant subjects from Study 
ING112574 and Study ING116529. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
an editorial change in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Further, the MAH provided an updated population PK 
analysis in treatment-experienced, INI-naïve and 
INI-resistant subjects using pooled PK data from 
Study ING111762, Study ING112961, Study 
ING112574 and Study ING116529 and also provided 
PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling data for 
subjects with baseline integrase resistance. Upon 
background therapy) in subjects with primary 
genotypic resistance to INIs at Screening in 30 subjects. 
Treatment-emergent mutations observed were 
consistent with those observed in the VIKING-3 study. 
At baseline, median patient age was 49 years, 20% were 
female, 58% non-white, and 23% had hepatitis B and/or C 
co-infection. Median baseline CD4+ was 160 cells/mm3, 
median duration of prior ART was 13 years, and 63% were 
CDC Class C. Subjects showed multiple class ART 
resistance at baseline: 80% had ≥2 NRTI, 73% ≥1 NNRTI, 
and 67% ≥2 PI major mutations; 83% had non-R5 virus. 
Sixteen of 30 subjects (53%) harboured Q148 virus at 
baseline. 
At week 48, 12/30 (40%) subjects had HIV-1 RNA <50 
copies/mL (ITT-E, Snapshot algorithm). 
In a combined analysis of VIKING-3 and VIKING-4 (n=186, 
VO population), the proportion of subjects 
with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 126/186 
(68%). The proportion of subjects with HIV RNA

request by the CHMP during the procedure, sections 
4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC were updated to 
reflect that an increased dose of dolutegravir may be 
considered for patients with limited treatment 
options (less than 2 active agents) due to advanced 
multi class resistance.

<50 copies/mL was 96/126 (76%) for No Q148 mutations, 
22/41 (54%) for Q148+1 and 5/19 (26%) for 
Q148+≥2 secondary mutations. 
In the presence of documented resistance that includes 
Q148 + ≥2 secondary mutations from G140A/C/S, 
E138A/K/T, L74I, modelling suggests that an increased 
dose may be considered for patients with limitedtreatment 
options (less than 2 active agents) due to advanced multi 
class resistance. 
PK/PD modelling using pooled data from clinical studies in 
integrase resistant patients suggests that 
increasing the dose from 50 mg twice daily to 100 mg twice 
daily may increase the effectiveness of 
dolutegravir in patients with integrase resistance and 
limited treatment options due to advanced multi class 
resistance. The proportion of responders (HIV-1 RNA <50 
c/mL) at week 24 was predicted to increase 
around 4-18% in the subjects with Q148 + ≥2 secondary 
mutations from G140A/C/S, E138A/K/T, L74I. 
Although these simulated results have not been confirmed 
in clinical trials, this high dose may be considered 
in the presence of the Q148 + ≥2 secondary mutations 
from G140A/C/S, E138A/K/T, L74I in patients with 
overall limited treatment options due to advanced multi 
class resistance. There is no clinical data on the 
safety or efficacy of the 100 mg twice daily dose. Co-
treatment with atazanavir increases the exposure of 
dolutegravir markedly, and should not be used in 
combination with this high dose, since safety with the 
resulting dolutegravir exposure has not been established.

avoided in the presence of integrase class resistance. This 
includes co-administration with medicinal products that 
reduce dolutegravir exposure (e.g. magnesium/ aluminium-
containing antacid, iron and calcium supplements, 
multivitamins and inducing agents, etravirine (without 
boosted protease inhibitors), tipranavir/ritonavir, 
rifampicin, St. John’s wort and certain anti-epileptic drugs). 
Dolutegravir increased metformin concentrations. A dose 
adjustment of metformin should be considered when 
starting and stopping coadministration of dolutegravir with 
metformin, to maintain glycaemic control. Metformin is 
eliminated renally and therefore it is of importance to 
monitor renal function when co-treated with dolutegravir. 
This combination may increase the risk for lactic acidosis in 
patients with moderate renal impairment (stage 3a 
creatinine clearance [CrCl] 45– 59 mL/min) and a cautious 
approach is recommended. Reduction of the metformin 
dose should be highly considered.  
Section 4.5 of the SmPC provides further detailed 
recommendations concerning co-administration with 
medicinal products by therapeutic areas.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN     
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR FLIXABI 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Flixabi. The RMP details important 
risks of Flixabi, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Flixabi's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Flixabi's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Flixabi should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Flixabi  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Flixabi's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Flixabi  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  rheumatoid  arthritis,  Crohn’s  disease  (adult  and 
pediatric), ulcerative colitis (adult and pediatric) , ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and 
psoriasis (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains infliximab as the active substance, and 
it is given by the intravenous route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Flixabi’s benefits can be found in Flixabi’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/flixabi   
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important  risks  of  Flixabi,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Flixabi's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Flixabi,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks (see section II.B, below). 
In  addition  to  risk  minimization  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including in Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) so 
that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Flixabi  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Flixabi. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Serious infection/sepsis 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Study SB2-G31-RA; SmPCs for Flixabi and Remicade, Section 4.8 
‘Undesirable effects’ and Section 4.4 ‘Special warnings and precautions 
for use’; referenced scientific publications. Strength of evidence is not 
applicable as the information is aligned with the safety profile of the 
reference product following the regulatory requirements for biosimilar 
products. 
 
 
Serious infection/sepsis 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Serious infection/sepsis 
Combined use of immunosuppressants is associated with an increased 
risk of serious infections. The risk factors include age > 65 years, 
concomitant use of abatacept, and MTX. 
Hepatitis B virus reactivation 
Immune suppression, including in patients receiving chemotherapy and 
immunosuppressive therapy, is seen as a high risk factor in hepatitis B 
surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients. Prophylaxis with entecavir 
or tenofovir for 6 to 12 months after the end of immunosuppressive 
therapy is deemed mandatory in these patients. Additionally, screening 
and vaccination is recommended in serologically negative cases for 
patients with IBD to prevent HBV reactivation.  
In a recent study, HBsAg together with detectable HBV DNA, 
rituximab administration or treatment with steroids were shown to be 
independent risk factors leading to HBV reactivation 
HBV reactivation risk in HBsAg negative patients was assessed at the 
level of 3-10% in a study of 244 lymphoma patients by Hui et al. 
Mainly this was attributed to the concomitant administration of 
rituximab and steroid drugs. 
Opportunistic infections 
The risk factors include age > 65 years and concomitant use of 
abatacept, and MTX. Patients suffering from chronic infections or who 
have a history of recurrent infections, or patients who have travelled or 
lived in endemic areas for histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, etc., might 
constitute a risk group for opportunistic infections. 
Tuberculosis 
Particular immune compromised groups, such as HIV patients and 
patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, are at higher risk for TB 
infection, as well as TB reactivation. The risk factors include age > 
65 years, concomitant use of abatacept, and MTX

Patients with pre-existing MS or Guillain-Barré syndrome belong to the 
high-risk group. Additionally, first-degree relatives of patients with MS 
have an increased propensity for developing MS, with a sibling relative 
risk ranging between 18 and 36, evidence strongly suggesting that TNF 
inhibitors should not be used in first-degree relatives of patients with 
MS.

Risk minimisation measures 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Infliximab crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of 
infants up to 12 months following birth. After in utero exposure to 
infliximab, infants may be at increased risk of infection, including 
serious disseminated infection that can become fatal. Administration of 
live vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to infliximab in 
utero is not recommended for 12 months after birth. Cases of 
agranulocytosis have also been reported.

for use’; referenced scientific publications. Strength of evidence is not 
applicable as the information is aligned with the safety profile of the 
reference product following the regulatory requirements for biosimilar 
products. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Malignancy 
Patients with a history of malignancies. Patients with increased risk of 
malignancies due to heavy smoking. When considering TNF-blocking 
therapy for patients with a history of malignancy or when considering 
continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. Patients 
with psoriasis and a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant 
therapy or prolonged PUVA treatment. 
Lymphoma 
There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in 
RA patients with long standing, highly active, inflammatory disease.                                                         
Studies by Askling et al.22 and Baecklund et al. have shown that patients 
with RA have an approximately 2-fold increased risk of lymphoma and 
leukaemia. The increase in lymphoma risk is limited to those RA 
patients who have long standing and very severe disease. 
In a prospective study designed to determine the rate of lymphoma 
among patients with RA, those who developed lymphoma (irrespective 
of treatment) were significantly older, had more comorbidities, were 
more likely to be male, had more education, and were more likely to be 
non-Hispanic whites compared with those that did not develop 
lymphoma. 
HSTCL 
The vast majority of HSTCL cases with infliximab use have occurred in 
patients with CD or UC and most were reported in adolescents or young 
adult males. Almost all patients had received treatment with 
azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with or 
immediately prior to infliximab. The potential risk with the combination 
of AZA or 6-MP and infliximab should be carefully considered, as the 
risk for development of HSTCL among such patients cannot be 
excluded.                                                         
Paediatric malignancy 
According to the Remicade and Flixabi SmPCs, children and 
adolescents exposed to infliximab are the risk groups.3,4 Underlying 
autoimmune disease and concomitant use of immunosuppressants could 
increase the risk of malignancies among patients on infliximab; 
however, a clear causal relationship could not be established. 
Leukaemia 
According to the Remicade and Flixabi SmPCs, patients with long-
standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, and those with a history 
of malignancy are at an increased risk of developing leukaemia after

infliximab treatment. Caution should also be exercised in patients with 
psoriasis and a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy 
or prolonged PUVA treatment. Caution should be exercised in 
considering treatment of patients with increased risk for malignancy due 
to heavy smoking or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A risk for 
the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated 
with TNF-blockers cannot be excluded.                                                         
Melanoma 
Patients with risk factors for skin cancer. Among patients considered for 
TNF-therapy, patients with a history of malignancy, or patients who 
develop a malignancy during treatment and considering continuation of 
the treatment. Patients with psoriasis and a medical history of extensive 
immunosuppressant therapy or prolonged PUVA treatment.                                                         
Merkel cell carcinoma 
Factors such as advanced age, immunosuppression (such as organ 
transplants and HIV), other cancers, and UV light exposure may 
increase the risk of developing Merkel cell carcinoma. 
Cervical cancer 
A population-based retrospective cohort study using data from Swedish 
national health registries found an increased incidence of cervical cancer 
in women with rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab compared to 
biologics-naïve patients or the general population, including those over 
60 years of age.

Summary of the risk management plan for Entresto®, Neparvis®
(Sacubitril/valsartan)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Entresto. The RMP details 
important  risks  of  Entresto,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimized,  and  how  more 
information  will  be  obtained  about  Entresto’s  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing 
information).
Entresto’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential  information  to healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how  Entresto 
should be used.
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Entresto  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-
language  summary,  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report 
(EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Entresto’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Entresto is indicated in adult patients for treatment of symptomatic chronic heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction and in children and adolescents patients aged 
one  year  and  older  with  symptomatic  chronic  heart  failure  with  left  ventricular 
systolic dysfunction  (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It  contains  sacubitril  and 
valsartan as the active substances and it is given orally. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Entresto’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Entresto’s  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important  risks  of  Entresto,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and 
the proposed studies for learning more about Entresto’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;

 The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  the  case  of  Entresto,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  Entresto  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal 
product can be safely taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified 
or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof 
of a link with the use of Entresto. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, 
but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further 
evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., 
on the long-term use of the medicine).

measures
Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities
Hypotension is most likely to occur in patients in whom 
the BP is highly dependent on Angiotensin II, including 
those with sodium or volume depletion (e.g., with 
diuretics). Concomitant use of aliskiren-containing 
products with LCZ696 in patients with diabetes is 
contraindicated because of the associated increased 
risks of hyperkalemia, renal impairment and hypotension 
with the combination of RAAS agents with aliskiren in 
this population. PDE-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil may 
have a more than additive effect of lowering blood 
pressure.
Routine risk minimization measures
To communicate the risk of hypotension and to reduce 
the risk of clinically significant hypotension.

data is consistent with the aforementioned information.
Patients at greatest risk for renal impairment are those 
with CKD, those in whom the BP is highly dependent on 
Angiotensin II, including those with sodium or volume 
depletion (e.g., with diuretics), renovascular 
hypertension, and patients with bilateral renal artery 
stenosis or those treated with another RAAS agent. 
Concomitant use of aliskiren-containing products with 
LCZ696 in patients with diabetes mellitus is 
contraindicated because of the risk of renal impairment. 
Caution is required in patients under dual RAAS agent 
treatment.

Patients with severe renal impairment are more at risk 
for hyperkalemia.
Furthermore, patients using potassium-sparing 
concomitant medications, mineral-corticoid antagonists, 
potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing 
potassium are also at a higher risk for hyperkalemia.

Current evidence is based on adult (CLCZ696B2314) 
and pediatric (CLCZ696B2319) HF studies and 
CLCZ696B2013 (US PMR, NIS) studies and mechanistic 
plausibility. The Entresto post-marketing data is 
consistent with the aforementioned information.
A past medical history of angioedema and concomitant 
use of ACE inhibitors are considered to be risk factors 
for developing angioedema during LCZ696 treatment. 
African Americans are known to be at higher risk for 
ACE inhibitor induced angioedema as well as smokers. A 
history of seasonal allergies, antihistamine use, or 
corticosteroid use is associated with an increased risk of 
ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema. Smokers and 
former smokers are at increased risk of ACE inhibitor–
associated angioedema, whereas patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus are at decreased risk. 
Immunosuppressant use, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
history of transplant have been associated with an 
increased risk of ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema.

Currently, there is no evidence to support the existence 
of this risk. In pre-clinical study, sacubitril and valsartan 
were excreted in the milk of lactating rats. However, it 
is not known whether LCZ696 is excreted in human 
milk.

The available current body of evidence (CT and post-
marketing data) do not establish a potential causal 
association between Entresto and hepatotoxicity.
Pre- existing liver conditions (metabolic, infectious, 
traumatic, neoplastic, immune-mediated, congenital, 
drug-mediated, alcohol-related) are all risk factors for 
liver toxicity. In clinical trials in patients with HF, the 
number of patients developing liver enzyme 
abnormalities and/or AEs during LCZ696 treatment was 
too small to identify risk factors. Heart failure in itself is 
a known risk factor for liver function abnormalities

In  preclinical  studies,  Entresto  had  an  effect  on  CSF 
amyloid-β clearance, increasing CSF amyloid-β in young 
treated  with  Entresto  50 
cynomolgus  monkeys 
mg/kg/day  for  two  weeks.  A  healthy  volunteer  study 
showed  that  Entresto  had  no  significant  effect  on  CSF 
levels of the amyloid-β species 1-42 or 1-40, compared 
with placebo, whereas a 42% increase in CSF AUEC0-36h 
of soluble amyloid-β 1-38 was observed, compared with 
placebo. The clinical relevance of increased CSF levels of 
amyloid-β 1-38 is unknown, but is considered unlikely to 
be 
toxicity. 
Clinical studies CLCZ696B2314 and CLCZ696D2301 and 
PASS  CLCZ696B2320  studies  showed  no  evidence  of 
increased  risk  of  cognitive impairment  with  Entresto. 
Post-marketing data was consistent with the CT data.

The evidence of Entresto-statin DDI was from non-
clinical studies, Study CLCZ696B2115, Study 
LCZ696B2314, and post-marketing data. Current 
cumulative data is not adequate to suggest a definitive 
interaction with concurrent Entresto and statin therapy 
leading to rhabdomyolysis. Additionally, no DDI has 
been observed with simvastatin in the dedicated DDI 
study.
Patients with history of alcohol use, drug abuse, heat 
stroke, infections, trauma, metabolic disorders, 
strenuous activities and inflammatory myopathies are 
at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis. Patients with 
concomitant exposure to statins and 
sacubitril/valsartan.

Juvenile toxicity studies in rats showed reversible and 
transient reductions in body weight gain, bone length 
and bone mineral density, most prevalent on day 21 
(corresponding to ~2 years of age in humans) and 
coinciding with times of highest exposure to 
sacubitril/LBQ657 and decreased body weight changes. 
No evidence of compound-related increase in bone 
resorption, microscopic bone changes, or changes in 
intrinsic bone strength was observed. 
In the 52-week pediatric HF study CLCZ696B2319 
(PANORAMA-HF), there were 2 events each in 
sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril and the exposure-
adjusted incidence rate of these AEs was similar in the 
sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups (1.080 (95% 
CI: 0.131, 3.901) vs. 1.116 (95% CI: 0.135, 4.031) 
per 100 patient-years). None of the events were drug-
related or led to permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment. Mean change from baseline to week 52 in 
height and height z-score were comparable overall and 
across all three age groups.

Rationale and study objectives
To further characterize specific safety outcomes 
(angioedema, hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal 
impairment, hepatotoxicity) in HF patients newly 
starting treatment with LCZ696 (regardless of prior 
use of ACEIs or ARBs) under real conditions.
To assess the risk of statin-related events 
associated with concomitant exposure to LCZ696 
and statins compared to statin exposure alone in HF 
patients.
To evaluate long- term safety and tolerability of 
sacubitril/valsartan in pediatric HF subjects 
receiving open-label sacubitril/valsartan.

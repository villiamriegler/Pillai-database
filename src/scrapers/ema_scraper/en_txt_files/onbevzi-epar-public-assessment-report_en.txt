2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
About the product 
Onbevzi (Company code SB8) has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product (biosimilar) 
to the reference medicinal product Avastin
having bevacizumab as the active substance.  
Onbevzi (bevacizumab) belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group “monoclonal antibodies” (ATC code: 
L01XC07). 
Bevacizumab selectively binds to human VEGF and inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt-1 
and KDR, on the surface of endothelial cells. Neutralizing the biologic activity of VEGF reduces the 
vascularisation of tumours, thereby inhibiting tumour growth. Administration of bevacizumab or its 
parental murine antibody to xenotransplant models of cancer in nude mice resulted in extensive anti-
tumour activity in human cancers, including colon, breast, pancreas and prostate. Metastatic disease 
progression was also inhibited, and microvascular permeability was reduced. 
The applicant claims the same therapeutic indications for Onbevzi as granted for Avastin
in the EU, 
except for the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer in combination with paclitaxel. Onbevzi is intended for the treatment of the 
carcinoma of the colon or rectum, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer, epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, and carcinoma of the cervix (see section 1). The 
recommended posology and method of administration correspond to those of Avastin. 
Onbevzi must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of 
antineoplastic medicinal products. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Onbevzi is a biosimilar medicinal product (reference product Avastin). It is presented as a sterile 
concentrate for solution for infusion containing 100 mg of bevacizumab in a 4 mL vial or 400 mg 
bevacizumab in a 16 mL vial (strength 25 mg/mL). The active substance bevacizumab is formulated 
with commonly used excipients: trehalose dihydrate, sodium acetate trihydrate, acetic acid, 
polysorbate 20 and water for injections. 
Onbevzi is provided in a single use Type I glass vial with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminium 
crimping cap. Onbevzi is supplied in packs of 1 vial of 4 mL or 16 mL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 11/120 
 
 
 
 
 
The necessary amount of bevacizumab should be withdrawn and diluted to the required administration 
volume with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. The concentration of the final 
bevacizumab solution should be kept within the range of 1.4 mg/mL to 16.5 mg/mL.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Bevacizumab, also referred to as SB8, is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody produced by 
DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. It selectively binds to human vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF).   
Bevacizumab is composed of two heavy chains (453 amino acid residues) and two light chains (214 
amino acid residues) with a total molecular weight of 149 kDa. One N-linked glycosylation site is 
located at Asn303. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacture 
The SB8 active substance for commercial supply is manufactured at the Biogen large-scale 
manufacturing facility in Hillerod in Denmark. All sites involved in manufacture and testing of the 
active substance have been listed. The exact responsibility of each listed site is described. Confirmation 
of the GMP status of the different sites was provided.  
The manufacturing process of the SB8 active substance is a process typical for monoclonal antibodies. 
The manufacturing process begins with thawing of a vial of the working cell bank (WCB), which is a 
CHO cell line transfected with SB8 expression vector. After thawing of the WCB vial, the culture is 
serially expanded in cell mass and volume for inoculation into the production bioreactor. The cell 
culture fluid is subsequently purified through a series of chromatographic steps, virus inactivation and 
filtration steps. 
Batch and scale as well as the batch numbering system have been appropriately defined.  
Different categories of process parameters have been defined: 
- Process input parameters: 
Critical controlled parameters (CCPs) are input parameters that impact product quality within a unit 
operation and may also affect process performance. Key controlled parameters (KCPs) are unlikely to 
affect a critical quality attribute (CQA), but they do impact process consistency.  
- Process output parameters:  
In-process controls (IPCs) and in-process tests (IPTs) are process ‘outputs’. Critical in-process controls 
(CIPCs) and critical in-process tests (CIPTs) are a subset that assess product quality attributes. 
Control of materials 
Materials used in the manufacture of the active substance have been listed identifying where each 
material is used in the process. Information on the quality and control of these materials has been 
provided. For non-compendial raw materials appropriate in-house specifications are in place. The 
composition of the media and solutions used in the cell culture as well as the composition of buffers 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 12/120 
 
 
 
and solutions for the purification steps are given. In addition, the chromatographic resins and filters 
are listed and the test performed on these items are mentioned.  
Information on the source of the cell substrate and analysis of the expression construct used to 
genetically modify cells and incorporated in the initial cell clone used to develop a research bank is 
given. A two-tiered cell bank system consisting of a master cell bank (MCB) and WCB has been 
established from the research cell bank. The cell banks have been appropriately characterised and 
genetic stability of the cell substrate been tested. Criteria for the generation of future cell banks are 
defined. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Appropriate limits for process parameters have been established. The parameters are considered 
appropriate to ensure that the manufacturing process is sufficiently under control. Of note, a revision 
of certain in- and output parameters have taken place after the process validation taking process 
knowledge gained from the validation campaign, manufacturing experience, additional process 
characterisation results, risk assessments, and overall process capabilities into account. To address the 
potential impact of the extended H-chain C-terminal sequence variant (detected at low levels in SB8, 
but not in Avastin) on product safety, the initially proposed control strategy has been strengthened. 
The qualification data including specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision (repeatability and intermediate 
precision), and range demonstrate the analytical method is suitable for its use. 
Process validation 
Validation of the active substance manufacturing process consisted of consecutive process verification 
batches. All investigated parameters successfully met the criteria; a few deviations could be sufficiently 
justified to have no impact on the validity of the conducted process validation. Further studies 
addressing impurity and viral clearance, process intermediate hold time, chromatographic resin 
lifetime, and shipping have been conducted. These studies confirm that the active substance 
manufacturing process performs effectively and reproducibly to deliver an active substance meeting its 
predetermined specifications and quality attributes.  
Manufacturing process development  
Different levels of risk assessment have been conducted to a) identify CQAs, b) guide the level of 
process evaluation and c) to determine the appropriate risk mitigation and control strategy for the 
process validation campaign.  
The development of the active substance manufacturing process from the pilot to the clinical and 
further to the process performance validation phase has been described.  
Of importance, the clinical studies have been supplied with clinical material derived from the site 
located in the US whereas the process verification was done at the commercial Biogen site in Hillerod, 
DK. A comprehensive comparability exercise demonstrated that the clinical material from the US site 
has a comparable quality profile with material from the Biogen site in Hillerod. Therefore, it is 
confirmed that the used clinical material is representative for the intended commercial material. This 
issue was also discussed in a scientific advice where the CHMP principally agreed with the strategy for 
the process transfer to a different site. Some recommendations concerning the conduct of the 
comparability exercise were not fully taken on board in the initial submission. Nevertheless, the issues 
raised during the procedure could be solved.

Characterisation 
An extensive characterisation of the active substance has been performed. Standard and state-of-the 
art methods for primary, secondary, and higher-order structures, glycosylation, charge variants, 
purity/impurities, cellular potency, and binding activity have been used for the elucidation of structure 
and other characteristics of SB8. For most tests, active substance and finished product derived from 
the process verification campaigns have been included. Certain quality attributes have been 
characterised at the level of finished product only. The applicant’s argumentation that characterisation 
data with the finished product are considered to be equivalent to those that would have been obtained 
with the active substance since the active substance and finished product have identical active 
ingredients, can be agreed. As requested, potentially immunogenic carbohydrate structures and the 
presence of terminal alpha-1,3 galactose structures have been addressed. It should be noted that 
although Fc effector functions of bevacizumab may play only a very limited role in the claimed 
indications (the primary mode of action is the binding of soluble VEGF-A isoforms and thus inhibition of 
binding of this ligand to its receptor) a full characterisation of the Fc effector functions has been 
performed. Of note, no ADCC or CDC activity could be detected, which supports the applicant’s 
conclusion that the Fc-effector functions are not relevant.  
The applicant has discussed potential process-related as well as product related impurities. Process-
related impurities which include HCP, host cell DNA were monitored.  
Detailed control strategy of product-related impurities for commercial batches was provided. 
Specification 
The specification for routine release control of active substance include tests for identity, purity and 
impurities, biological activity and other general tests. 
The applicant provided justifications for quality attributes that are not included in the SB8 specifications. 
In addition, adequate justification was provided for the proposed methods.  
Analytical procedures 
Overall, the analytical procedures were sufficiently described and the analytical methods are 
considered adequate for their intended use. The validation of non-compendial analytical procedures 
was performed satisfactory according to the corresponding guideline ICH Q2(R1). For the majority of 
the analytical methods, active substance and finished product batches were included in the validation 
studies. Anyway, it is agreed that the method validation using active substance batches is also valid for 
finished product batches, since both active substance and finished product batches have the same 
formulation. Some uncertainties regarding the samples used for the validation of the analytical 
procedures have been solved.  
The transfer of the analytical methods was adequately performed. The information provided in relation 
to analytical method transfers is considered acceptable.  
Compendial methods were verified, which is in line with ICH Q2(R1). 
Batch analyses 
The batches were tested and fulfilled the acceptance criteria valid at the time of testing. These data 
indicate that the active substance manufacturing process consistently delivers material meeting its 
predetermined specifications and quality attributes.

Reference standard 
No international standard for bevacizumab is available. Thus, internal reference standards have been 
established during the SB8 development.  A protocol for qualification for future reference standards for 
commercial batches has been provided.  
Container closure 
A description of the container closure system has been provided, including the identity of materials of 
construction of each primary packaging component.  
Furthermore, an extractable study was conducted: no metals attributable to the test article were 
observed whereas the detected organic compounds were generally present at levels which would not 
be expected to pose any risk of adverse effects.  
Stability 
The proposed shelf-life of commercial active substance is based on the long-term stability results and 
is acceptable. Representativeness of the batches for the commercial active substance was discussed 
and appropriately addressed.   
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
SB8 finished product is a clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale brown, sterile and 
preservative-free solution and presented as a single-use vial containing 100 mg and 400 mg of 
bevacizumab as concentrate for solution for intravenous infusion.  
One single-use vial contains bevacizumab as the active substance, and the following excipients: 
trehalose dihydrate, sodium acetate trihydrate, acetic acid, and polysorbate 20. All excipients comply 
with the Ph. Eur. 
The primary packaging material for SB8 100 mg and 400 mg finished product consists of a Type I glass 
vial, a sterilised bromobutyl rubber stopper and a cap. The components of the container closure 
system are Ph. Eur. grade. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The formulation development was based on the reference medicinal product Avastin. Studies were 
performed to confirm the effects of pH, buffer, excipient, and protein concentration on the stability of 
SB8 finished product. The differences in buffering agents between Onbevzi and Avastin were justified 
and are considered acceptable. 
Manufacturing process development 
Before initiating process verification of SB8 100 mg finished product, an engineering batch each from 
SB8 100 mg and 400 mg. The SB8 100 mg and 400 mg finished product engineering runs were 
successfully completed. Each of the studies within the batch record was executed and satisfactory 
results were obtained. The parameters and conditions verified during the studies would be applied to 
process verification runs.  
Container Closure System [100 mg/ 400 mg] 
In order to assess the suitability of the finished product container closure system, extractables of the 
extractable compounds were set and leachables studies were conducted. Container closure integrity 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 15/120 
 
 
 
has been studied during development of SB8 finished product and this test is included in the ongoing 
stability studies. 
Elemental impurities in the finished product were evaluated in a leachables study. The study results 
demonstrated that no metallic impurity was identified permitted daily exposure (PDE) levels listed in 
ICH Q3D. Therefore, it is agreed that potential risks associated to the elemental impurities are low and 
that there is no need to include control of elemental impurities in the finished product specification.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
All sites involved in manufacture and testing of the active substance have been listed. The exact 
responsibility of each listed site is described. Confirmation of the GMP status of the different sites was 
provided.  
The manufacture of SB8 finished product includes thawing and pooling of the active substance, bulk 
formulation, mixing, reduction filtration and sterile filtration and aseptic filling, visual inspection, bulk 
packaging, labelling and secondary packaging.  
The same principles for input and output definitions applied for active substance are also applied for 
finished product process controls. For the input parameters, critical-, key- and non-key control 
parameters have been defined for each step in the process as well as the outputs; critical and process 
consistency in-process controls and in-process tests. The criticality is associated with impact on the 
defined CQAs of the SB8 finished product. The definitions for the limits have been described. 
Process validation 
The manufacturing process validation presented for SB8 finished product 100 mg and 400 mg involves 
the following studies: manufacturing process verification, sterile filter validation, media fill qualification, 
shipping qualification.  
The manufacturing process has been validated on commercial batches of SB8 finished product 100 mg 
and 400 mg at the commercial product manufacturing site according to an approved protocol and with 
predefined acceptance criteria. The overall results confirm that the process is considered well under 
control to reproducibly manufacture SB8 finished product complying with the established specifications.  
The validation of the filters used for bioburden reduction and sterilisation of the SB8 solution is 
conducted. All results complied with the predetermined acceptance criteria and verify that the filters 
are appropriate for filtering SB8 finished product volumes.  
Media fill qualification is conducted at the SB8 finished product manufacturing site. The applicant 
confirmed that the overall duration of the conducted media fill runs is reflective of the filling time of the 
commercial process. 
Product specification 
The specification for routine release control of finished product include tests for identity, purity and 
impurities, biological activity and other general tests. 
Detailed justifications of the specifications were provided. 
Analytical procedures  
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 16/120 
 
 
 
The analytical procedures used for release and shelf life testing of both SB8 active substance and 
finished product are provided in the respective active substance section of the dossier. Concerning the 
establishment of acceptance criteria reference is made to the respective active substance section of the 
dossier. Non-compendial methods are adequately validated. 
Batch analysis  
Data have been presented for 100 mg and 400 mg finished product batches manufactured during 
development.  
All results in the batch analysis section of tested parameters were within the defined limits. 
No new product-related impurities are seen in the SB8 finished product. Specific impurity data that is 
presented for the finished product refers to extended controls on particulate matter. In addition to the 
release and stability testing using the compendial Ph. Eur. 2.9.19 method, particulates have been 
assessed in characterisation studies. These studies were performed on the process verification batches 
and show that the particle content is similar in magnitude for these batches of 100 mg and 400 mg. 
Reference standard 
The reference standards used in the release and stability testing of SB8 finished product are the same 
as those used for the release and stability testing of SB8 active substance. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of 100 mg/4 mL and 400 mg/16 mL finished product is 36 months when stored 
at the recommended temperature of 2-8°C.  
SB8 stability studies are complete and were conducted with accordance with ICH and CHMP guidelines 
in the proposed commercial primary packaging. All quality attributes met acceptance criteria and 
showed no significant changes for 36 months at long-term and accelerated conditions.  
At the long-term storage condition, the up-to-date results met the acceptance criteria and there is no 
significant change for any parameter. 
Furthermore, stability profiles were compared between the 100 and 400 mg finished product in terms 
of purity/impurity and biological activity at long-term, accelerated, and stress conditions. The results 
are considered comparable. 
A photostability study was provided and data showed that SB8 finished product is photosensitive. The 
outer commercial packaging protects the finished product from light.  
A shelf life of 36 months (2°C-8°C, protected from light) for the finished product is acceptable.  
In-use stability studies were carried out to evaluate the stability of SB8 finished product after dilution. 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours at 2°C to 30°C in sodium 
chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. From a microbiological point of view, the product should 
be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the 
responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution 
has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
The strategy used to ensure that the SB8 active substance and the resulting finished product are free 
of adventitious agents has been provided. The strategy is in compliance with the requirements in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 17/120 
 
 
 
ICH Guideline Q5A and includes: a) testing of the MCB and WCB, as well as the end of production cell 
bank b) control of raw materials of human or animal origin, c) in-process testing of unprocessed bulk 
harvest for adventitious agents, d) virus clearance validation studies to establish a retroviral safety 
factor for the SB8 purification process, e) procedural and facility controls. 
Certificates of Suitability and / or Certificates of Origin have been provided for all raw materials of 
human or animal origin. Mycoplasma testing for qualification of the MCB, WCB and end of production 
cell bank was performed in accordance with ICH guidelines (Q5D). Furthermore, during active 
substance manufacture, the unprocessed bulk is analysed for mycoplasma, which is also based on Ph. 
Eur. 2.6.7. No mycoplasma has been detected in the unprocessed bulks. 
Virus safety testing on the MCB and WCB were performed in accordance with ICH guidelines Q5A and 
Q5D.  
Viral clearance capacity of the SB8 purification process was validated in accordance with the ICH 
Guideline Q5A (R1). Specific steps, which were considered as effective steps for viral clearance, were 
selected and their viral clearance capacity was validated. Two virus inactivation steps, virus filtration, 
and chromatography steps were selected for validation. The validation was performed using fresh resin 
and aged resin. Viral clearance study using aged resin was performed to demonstrate that the viral 
clearance capacity is maintained throughout the resin life cycle. All purification processes mentioned 
above have orthogonal purification mechanisms. 
Overall, adventitious agents safety is considered sufficiently assured.

The outcome of the product quality risk assessment leading to a risk ranking and classification of 
quality attributes into critical and non-critical quality attributes has been presented. The biosimilarity 
programme started with an extensive characterisation of the EU-sourced reference medicinal product 
Avastin. A total of 46 EU-sourced Avastin lots have been purchased from the market and have been 
used for the similarity range establishment. A list including the exact lot number, strength and the 
expiry data of each single Avastin lot is provided. The expiry dates of the Avastin lots cover the period 
from February 2014 until September 2018, and the selection of the reference medicinal product has 
been appropriately justified following the guideline EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012. 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 19/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The characterisation of the reference medicinal product and the subsequent side-by-side comparison, 
using 18 SB8 lots and 9 Avastin lots, included a broad panel of standard and state-of-the-art methods 
which covered relevant physicochemical as well as biological quality attributes.  
In particular, quantity, primary structure (molecular weight, amino acid sequence, N- and C-terminal 
sequence, peptide mapping, methionine oxidation, deamidation, glycation), purity and impurities (SE-
HPLC, reducing and non-reducing CE-SDS), charged variants (CEX-HPLC, icIEF), hydrophobic variants 
(HI-HPLC), carbohydrate structure (identification of the N-glycan site, N-glycan identification, N-glycan 
profile), and higher order structure (CD-, intrinsic, extrinsic, and Fourier Transform Infrared 
spectroscopy, Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange, differential scanning calorimetry, SE-HPLC/MALLS, 
analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, and micro-flow imaging) have been addressed.  
Regarding the biological characteristics cell-based potency assays, binding assays, and Fc related 
activities, and additional assays have been used. 
In summary, the used panel of methods for characterisation and comparison of SB8 with its reference 
medicinal product is considered sufficient and no additional tests have been requested. As requested, 
the qualification status of the methods has been provided. In summary, the provided qualification 
results confirm that the methods are suitable for the intended use. Further details of certain biological 
assays have been provided. This is acceptable. 
Based on the data derived from extensive characterisation of the reference medicinal product, 
similarity ranges for the biosimilarity development have been established by statistical means.  
The statistical analysis involved tolerance intervals. The applicant neither justified why this specific 
statistical tool was chosen nor discussed potential limitations and shortcomings of the tolerance 
interval approach. For certain quality attributes (e.g. glycovariants %G1F and %G2F) the established 
similarity ranges seem to be relatively wide which increases the risk of false positive conclusions on 
biosimilarity. In the case of the above-mentioned glycovariants differences between SB8 and Avastin 
seem to be obvious, even though the data for SB8 were still within the similarity ranges. However, it 
should be noted that a tabulated overview of all raw data has been included. Thus, an assessment on 
biosimilarity was possible independently from the used statistical method and its potential limitations. 
As a consequence, no specific need to question the acceptability of the tolerance interval approach was 
identified. It should also be mentioned that for most of the quality attributes, only a subset of the 
purchased reference medicinal product lots, not the total of 46 reference medicinal product lots, have 
been characterised. 
Following the characterisation of the reference medicinal product and establishment of similarity 
ranges, a side-by side comparison of SB8 with Avastin has been performed. This side-by-side 
comparison included pilot, clinical and process performance qualification active substance batches as 
well as clinical and process performance qualification batches of the finished product (for both 
presentations) and Avastin. For all studies, EU Avastin was used as the reference medicinal product. 
For certain quality attributes (in particular in cases where only a qualitative comparison was possible 
and for methods which were considered as orthogonal to another method) the number of batches 
included in the side-by-side comparison was reduced. The inclusion of the clinical and process 
performance batches of SB8 active substance and finished product is endorsed. Biosimilarity could be 
demonstrated for most quality attributes. In particular, the various assays addressing the biological 
functions of bevacizumab showed a highly similar profile of SB8 with its reference medicinal product. 
At the physicochemical level, some differences have been observed:  
Of importance, the presence of additional C- and N-terminal sequence variants was observed in SB8, 
but not in EU Avastin. It was highlighted that the presence of sequence variants at low levels may have 
unanticipated safety consequences that were not apparent in the clinical studies. Consequently, 
potential safety risks from these sequence variants have been discussed by the applicant. Thus, these 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 20/120 
 
 
 
sequence variants are considered as product-related impurities which need to be strictly controlled by 
an appropriate control system, and the recommendations regarding the control strategy were given. 
A slightly higher purity profile has been measured for SB8 (lower %Total Aggregate and %Non-
Glycosylated Heavy Chain – NGHC). It is agreed with the applicant that this slightly improved purity 
profile does not preclude the biosimilarity claim.  
Differences have been observed for hydrophobic variants by HI-HPLC and the charged variant profile 
by CEX-HPLC and icIEF. Additional in-depth characterisation including structure-activity relationship 
studies have been conducted to elucidate the root cause for these altered hydrophobic and charged 
variant profiles and to rule out that these differences may jeopardise the biosimilarity claim. Taking 
into account the additional characterisation work as well as the demonstrated biosimilarity with respect 
to the biological quality attributes, it is agreed that these differences have been sufficiently justified. 
Nevertheless, to further substantiate the claim that the different hydrophobic variant profile does not 
impact the biological activity, the applicant has compared VEGF neutralisation (with the VEGF 
neutralisation assay) and the FcRn binding of the isolated fractions.  
Differences have been detected for the glycovariants %High Mannose and %Afucose. The applicant 
justified these differences by the non-relevance of the Fc effector functions for the mode of action of 
bevacizumab. Taking into consideration the comparable binding characteristics of SB8 and Avastin to 
the Fcy receptors and the absence of ADCC and CDC for both SB8 and Avastin, the conclusion of the 
applicant can be agreed. However, high mannose glycovariants may be relevant for the clearance of 
bevacizumab via the mannose receptor. As a consequence, an appropriate control for high mannose is 
agreed. 
Finally, the graphical presentation regarding the content of glycovariants %G1F and %G2F indicate 
slight differences between SB8 and Avastin although the data for SB8 are within the pre-established 
biosimilarity ranges. The applicant has sufficiently justified that these differences have no impact on 
the biosimilarity claim. 
To complement the biosimilarity exercise a number of comparative short-term stability studies under 
stress conditions to investigate and compare degradation pathways of SB8 with Avastin have been 
performed. These stress conditions included heat stress, basis and acidic stress, oxidative and photo 
stress. The data derived from these studies support the biosimilarity claim; a few concerns related to 
these comparative studies have been resolved. 
In summary, biosimilarity at quality level has been demonstrated. Although for some physicochemical 
quality attributes differences have been detected, these differences have been sufficiently justified to 
have no impact on the clinical performance of Onbevzi and its biosimilarity to the reference medicinal 
product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, a sufficient and comprehensive Module 3 has been provided. The active substance as well as 
the finished product manufacturing process have been appropriately described. In principle, an 
effective process control strategy based on appropriate controls of material attributes, in process 
controls and process parameters, and active substance and finished product specifications is in place to 
ensure that the process consistently delivers material meetings its predefined specifications and quality 
attributes.  
The performed consecutive process validation and the provided batch release data support this 
conclusion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 21/120 
 
 
 
Comparability of clinical material and process performance qualification/intended commercial material 
after process transfer to a different site has been demonstrated.  
A comprehensive and robust biosimilarity exercise demonstrates similarity of the biosimilar candidate 
with its reference medicinal product. Certain differences regarding hydrophobic, charged and N-glycan 
variants could be in most parts sufficiently justified: additional in-depth characterisation including 
structure-activity relationship studies of the fractioned samples have been conducted to elucidate the 
root cause for these altered hydrophobic and charged variant profiles and to rule out these differences 
may jeopardise the biosimilarity claim. In addition, a broad pattern of used bio- and binding assays 
could demonstrate biosimilarity for the biological characteristics.  
However, the presence of additional C- and N-terminal sequence variants at low levels, observed in 
SB8 but not in EU Avastin, was a matter of discussion during the procedure. The question emerged 
whether biosimilarity between two recombinant proteins, in this case between two IgG monoclonal 
antibodies, can be considered demonstrated despite certain differences in the amino acid sequence, 
since the concept of biosimilarity of recombinant proteins requires sequence identity. However, it 
should be highlighted that these sequence variants are extensions at the ends of the amino acid chain, 
and not amino acid insertions within the protein. The above-mentioned identity refers to the main 
component of the active substances and minor variants are conceived as product-related substances. 
The heavy chain C-terminal lysine heterogeneity is well known, and additional N-terminal residues 
from the signal peptides are not uncommon either. In summary, these sequence variants are 
considered as product-related impurities which need to be strictly controlled by an appropriate control 
system.  
Since a potential impact of these sequence variants on safety/immunogenicity – although not observed 
in the clinical efficacy and safety comparability study – could not be completely ruled out, the applicant 
strengthened the control strategy initially proposed. In addition, the applicant is recommended to a) 
consider a further tightening of the limit when a number of batch results sufficient for statistical 
analysis is available, and b) to implement a more direct control dedicated to control C-terminal 
sequence variants present in Onbevzi post-marketing.  
In addition, the non-clinical and clinical data provided by the applicant during the procedure support 
the demonstration of no clinically relevant difference in immunogenicity risk between SB8 and EU 
Avastin and do not preclude demonstration of biosimilarity (see clinical part of the assessment report). 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance is well characterised with regard to its physicochemical and biological 
characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate specifications are set. The 
fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately described, controlled and 
validated. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and 
validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. 
The chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
From a quality point of view, biosimilarity with the reference product Avastin is considered 
demonstrated. 
The overall quality of Onbevzi is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC.

Table 2: Summary of In Vitro PD study results 
In summary, the biological functions of SB8 and EU-sourced Avastin, i.e. VEGF-A binding, VEGF-A 
neutralisation, inhibition of HUVEC proliferation and migration as well as Fc-related activities, have 
been demonstrated to be similar. 
Two in vivo xenograft mouse studies were submitted, one in which biosimilarity was aimed to be 
demonstrated in a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenograft model, and one in which a colorectal 
carcinoma xenograft model was used. 
Study No. E0303-U1501: Evaluation of the Efficacy of Test Article SB8 in the Treatment of 
Subcutaneous NCI-H358 Human Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Xenograft Model  
In line with the evaluation of the therapeutic equivalence of SB8 and EU Avastin in NSCLC patients a 
non-clinical in vivo study was performed in mice bearing human lung cancer cell line-derived tumours. 
Mice were inoculated with NCI-H358 subcutaneously and treated three times weekly for a total of three 
weeks with doses of 0.7 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg of SB8, EU Avastin or US Avastin (and vehicle) when

tumours had reached a predefined size (Study No. E0303-U1501). The endpoints for the comparative 
assessment of efficacy were tumour size and tumour volume. In the 0.7 mg/kg dose group US and EU 
Avastin showed similar efficacy in terms of tumour growth reduction whereas SB8 can be considered 
less effective and even comparable to the vehicle group. 
In contrast, the 5 mg/kg dosing groups showed statistically significantly higher therapeutic efficacy as 
compared to the vehicle group with comparable values for tumour weight and volume irrespective of 
the compound administered.

COLO 205 Human Colorectal Carcinoma Xenograft Model 
In the colorectal carcinoma xenograft mouse study (Study No. E0303-U1502), the biosimilarity 
exercise has only been conducted with US Avastin as reference product.  
SB8 was capable of significantly reducing both the gain of tumour volume and tumour weight relative 
to the vehicle group. However, when comparing the antitumour efficacy of SB8 with the one of US 
Avastin, only the decreases in tumour volumes (as determined by the caliper method) did not 
significantly differ among the groups, whereas SB8 was significantly less efficient in decreasing tumour 
weight gain compared to US Avastin at all three tested doses (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

A four-week repeat dose toxicity study (Study Report – 000080642) conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys was submitted. This study also contained toxicokinetic investigations (serum levels and ADA 
formation). Study No. SBL327- 001 has been conducted with US Avastin as reference product.  
Table 5: Repeated dose toxicity study design 
The applicant demonstrated that SB8 and US Avastin were well tolerated by cynomolgus monkeys, 
even at considerably higher doses than the intended therapeutic ones. Furthermore, the toxicological 
and toxicokinetic profiles of SB8 and US Avastin groups were well comparable.  
There were no toxicologically significant changes considered to be SB8 or US Avastin related in clinical 
signs, injection site observation, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, electrocardiography, 
urinalysis, haematology, blood chemistry, necropsy, or organ weights in any group. However, 
thickening of the epiphyseal cartilage has been observed in SB8 and US Avastin groups. Moreover, the 
formation of germinal centres was observed in white pulp or secondary follicles in the spleen and 
mesenteric lymph nodes in both the SB8 and US Avastin groups, suggesting anti-drug antibody 
formation towards the administered SB8 and US Avastin. However, no SB8 and US Avastin–specific 
ADAs were identified in the toxicokinetic investigations that were included in this study.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bevacizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant 
risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), bevacizumab is exempt from 
preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A comprehensive panel of in vitro studies was conducted in support of demonstrating biosimilarity 
between EU Avastin and SB8.  In summary, the biological functions of SB8 and EU-sourced Avastin, 
i.e. VEGF-A binding, VEGF-A neutralisation, inhibition of HUVEC proliferation and migration as well as 
Fc-related activities, have been demonstrated to be similar. 
In support of the in vitro comparability exercise, two in vivo pharmacology studies in murine xenograft 
models as well as one repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys were submitted. From the 
regulatory perspective, these studies were not required to support a MAA for SB8, which was 
communicated to the applicant within an EMA scientific advice procedure 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/290133/2014, May 22, 2014), and which is in line with relevant EMA/CHMP 
guidelines on biosimilar products (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1; 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that the applicant submitted these

in vivo studies, as they were required for fulfilling the regulatory needs for the globally harmonised 
development of SB8 and are only provided as supportive information. 
Biosimilarity between SB8 and US Avastin has been tested in all three submitted in vivo studies, 
however, EU Avastin as reference product was only included in one of these studies (a study using a 
non-small cell lung cancer xenograft mouse model). As no dedicated studies were submitted in which 
the comparability between US and EU Avastin was investigated, the studies that were exclusively 
conducted with US Avastin are not considered relevant for the evaluation of biosimilarity between SB8 
and EU Avastin. 
In the non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model study, biosimilarity between SB8 and EU Avastin in 
terms of decreasing tumour volume and weight was generally shown at therapeutically sufficiently high 
doses (5 mg/kg). The low dose of 0.7 mg/kg appeared to be sub-therapeutic in the mouse model, 
which is reflected by the extremely high standard deviations in this dosing group. Thus, the observed 
differences between test and reference groups are regarded to be of low significance. However, in the 
colorectal carcinoma xenograft mouse study (Study No. E0303-U1502), biosimilarity between SB8 and 
US Avastin in the efficacy of decreasing tumour weight gain has not been shown, in fact SB8 
performed significantly worse in decreasing tumour weight gain relative to US Avastin. This 
observation points towards non-biosimilarity. However, the non-biosimilarity observed in the colorectal 
xenograft mouse study constitutes an isolated finding that was not reproduced in clinical trials, and 
that in vivo xenograft models are – in general – characterised by an inherently large variability so that 
their study results are not necessarily reliable for biosimilarity exercises. The results of this study do 
not contradict overall biosimilarity. Furthermore, as no dedicated studies were submitted in which the 
comparability between US and EU Avastin was investigated, this study is not unambiguously 
representative for demonstrating biosimilarity or absence of biosimilarity between SB8 and EU Avastin. 
No dedicated pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted, which is acceptable according to the 
EMA/CHMP guidelines on biosimilar products (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1, 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010).  
The toxicological and toxicokinetic profiles of SB8 and US Avastin in the four weeks repeated dose 
toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (Study No. SBL327-001) were comparable (however, this study 
was exclusively conducted with US Avastin as comparator). Regarding the mismatch in this study 
between germinal centre reaction observed in white pulp or secondary follicles in the spleen and 
mesenteric lymph nodes and the lacking ADAs in both the SB8 and US Avastin groups, it was clarified 
that the ADA serum analyses were not a likely cause of the observed mismatch. Furthermore, the 
applicant stated that the extent of germinal reactions in lymph nodes and the spleen was very limited, 
suggesting that potential ADA levels created out of these germinal reactions were low or even BLD. 
Additionally, the applicant elaborated that potential SB8-ADA immune complexes may have been 
cleared by an FcγR-mediated mechanism, which may have further decreased ADA levels (potentially 
BLD). No other toxicity studies were submitted, which is acceptable and in line with relevant EMA 
guidelines (e.g. EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1). 
In accordance with the EMA “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues” 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1, specific studies on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive 
and developmental toxicity, and local tolerance have not been submitted. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The submitted non-clinical data are considered adequate to support biosimilarity of SB8 and the 
reference product.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
 A pivotal PK study SB8-G11-NHV in healthy subjects (SB8 versus EU-Avastin, SB8 versus US 
sourced Avastin [hereafter referred to as, ‘US Avastin’], EU Avastin versus US Avastin) assessing 
similarity in PK profiles between SB and EU Avastin was submitted.

Additional PK evaluation was performed in a subset of patients, comparing SB8 versus EU Avastin as 
part of the clinical efficacy/safety study SB8-G31-NSCLC.  
PK Assays 
A quantitative Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) has been developed for the determination 
of SB8 and Avastin in human serum. The same assay was used in both studies (Phase I and Phase III 
study). This method utilised an indirect ELISA format to measure the concentration of SB8 and 
Bevacizumab in human serum.  
Clinical Phase I Study SB8-G11-NHV – Pivotal Pharmacokinetics 
Study Phase I SB8-G11-NHV was a randomised, double-blind, three arm, parallel-group, single dose 
study conducted in healthy male volunteers aged 18-55 years. 
The study was performed at one trial site in the EU (Belgium). The study duration was from April 25th 
to September 21st 2015. 
A total of 187 healthy male subjects were screened, of which 119 subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 
ratio to receive a single-dose of 3mg/kg of either SB8 (40 subjects), EU sourced Avastin (40 subjects), 
or US sourced Avastin (39 subjects) via IV infusion for 90 minutes. 
A total of 5 (4.2%) subjects (2 subjects in the SB8 treatment group, 2 subjects in the EU Avastin 
treatment group, and 1 subject in the US Avastin treatment group) had major protocol deviations (i.e. 
not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria after dosing, one subject received an incorrect dose of the IP, 
one subject was administered disallowed therapy), leading to exclusion of the PK population and 
leaving 38 subjects in each treatment group. 
Test product was SB8, and reference products were EU-sourced Avastin and US-sourced Avastin.  
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at 0 (pre-dose), 0.75, 1.5 (end of infusion), 3, 6, 12, 24, 
48 and 96 hours, then at Day 8 (168 h), 15 (336 h), 22 (504 h), 29 (672 h), 43 (1008 h) 57 (1344 h), 
71 (1680 h), and 85 (2016 h) after start of infusion. 
The primary objective was to investigate and compare the PK profiles between SB8 and EU sourced 
Avastin in healthy male subjects.   
The secondary objective was to investigate and compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity 
between SB8 and EU sourced Avastin in healthy male subjects. 
Additionally, SB8 was compared with US-Avastin in order to comply with the FDA requirements.  
Primary Pharmacokinetic Endpoints: 
AUCinf  
Secondary Pharmacokinetic Endpoints: AUClast, Cmax, Tmax, Vz, λz, t½, CL, %AUCextrap 
Equivalence of the primary (AUCinf) and key secondary endpoints (AUClast, Cmax) was determined if the 
90% CI for the ratio of geometric means of test-to-reference was within the predefined acceptance 
interval of 0.8 to 1.25.

Clinical Phase III Study SB8-G31-NSCLC – Supportive Pharmacokinetics 
This was a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to compare the efficacy, safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity between SB8 and Avastin in patients with metastatic or 
recurrent NSCLC. 763 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either SB8 or EU-Avastin at a dose of 
15mg/kg i.v. every 3 weeks, for 4 and up to a maximum of 6 cycles in the induction treatment phase 
together with PC chemotherapy, and then as a maintenance monotherapy as per randomisation until

disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or end of study (12 months from randomisation of 
the last patient), whichever occurred first.  
In a subset of these patients, the steady state PK of bevacizumab was assessed. Hence, the PK 
population comprised a total of 341/763 patients (44.7%) of whom 161/379 patients (42.5%) received 
SB8 and 180/384 (46.9%) received EU-Avastin, respectively.  
The PK study objective was to measure the study serum trough (Ctrough) and maximum (Cmax) 
concentration profiles of bevacizumab from Cycle 1 up to Cycle 7 and to compare them between the 
SB8 and EU Avastin treatment groups.  
Blood sampling for PK analysis was performed at pre-dose (Ctrough) and post-dose (Cmax) of IP (within 
15 minutes after the end of infusion) of Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7.  
Pharmacokinetic results: 
The mean values of pre-dose (Ctrough) and post-dose (Cmax) serum concentration profiles up to Cycle 7 
are depicted in Figure 2, suggesting that steady state was reached at Cycle 3.

A PK modelling approach was used to assess PK similarity between SB8 and Avastin in healthy subjects 
and patients with NSCLC by testing SB8 treatment as a covariate effect on relevant PK parameters in

each population and performing model-based simulations of bevacizumab exposure following each 
treatment.  
The population PK model was initially based on a published model for bevacizumab (Han et al. 2016), 
but was refined in a step-wise, partly data-driven fashion. The model was first estimated using phase I 
data, and subsequently extended including phase III data. Covariates were considered based on 
clinical judgment and mechanistic plausibility. They were analysed using a stepwise backward 
elimination to identify a more parsimonious model. Influential observations were identified and 
excluded. Predictive performance was assessed by visual predictive checks. 
Objectives 
The objectives of this analysis were to: 
• Develop a population PK model to characterise the concentration-time profiles of bevacizumab in 
healthy male subjects and NSCLC patients 
• Determine the effect of key extrinsic and intrinsic covariates on bevacizumab PK parameters 
• Evaluate the effect of anti-drug antibody (ADA) incidence on the PK of bevacizumab 
• Assess consistency in bevacizumab exposure between SB8 and Avastin (EU Sourced and US Sourced) 
in healthy subjects 
• Assess consistency in bevacizumab exposure between EU Sourced and US Sourced Avastin in healthy 
subjects 
• Assess consistency in bevacizumab exposure between SB8 and EU Sourced Avastin in the NSCLC 
patient population 
Results 
Model building results 
The equation for CL originally included 16 covariates in the full model which were reduced to 7 
covariates (
 Gender, Population, BALB, BWT, CRCL) by the application of a backward 
elimination procedure. 
The equation for Vc originally included 3 covariates (BWT, Gender and Population) which all stayed in 
the model after the application of the backward elimination algorithm.  
No covariates were included in the equations for Q and Vp which were simply estimated based on the 
whole data. Parameter estimates for the final model are provided in the table below.

Table 12: Final model parameter estimates with combined phase I and phase III study data  
Population PK parameter estimates in the final model (clearance [CL] = 0.0116 L/h; central volume of 
distribution [Vc] = 4.08 L; intercompartmental clearance [Q] = 0.0220 L/h; peripheral volume of 
distribution [Vp] = 2.12 L) were generally comparable with published values (CL = 0.0086 L/h; Vc = 
2.678 L; Q = 0.0186 L/h; Vp = 2.423 L) and also consistent with known PK properties of monoclonal 
antibodies. 
For assessing how the results of a statistical analysis can be generalise to an independent data set, 
cross-validation was applied to validate the predictive ability of the model. In case there is severe 
overfitting, e.g. high RMSE when using cross-validation, the results cannot be considered meaningful. 
The calculated root mean squared error of the model-predicted bevacizumab concentration (RMSE 
0.276 (0.202, 0.347)) was of similar magnitude as the RSME of the model reported by Han et al. 
(2016). The cross-validation of the whole backward elimination process was provided to calculate the 
predictive error of the whole model building procedure. Three training data sets were used in the 
cross-validation. Depending on the training set baseline albumin on clearance (CL), female gender on 
central volume of distribution (Vc), creatinine clearance (CRCL), and Phase III SB8 on CL were either 
included or removed following the backward elimination procedure. These were excluded in addition to 
the same eliminated covariates as for the full data-set model, except for Phase III tumour size on CL 
and baseline alkaline phosphatase (BALP). In linear regression it is possible to directly compute the 
factor by which the training MSE underestimates the validation MSE under the assumption that the 
model specification is valid. For the original model the training MSE (0.073) was very close to the 
validation MSE (0.078).  
In order to assess the robustness of the model results, avoid overfitting and detect possible differences 
between treatments, (i) the same analyses as for the final model was performed with the evaluated 
model by Han et al. adding terms for treatment and study and (ii) separate modelling of the PK 
parameters for SB8 and Avastin was done.

Results for the effect of key extrinsic and intrinsic covariates 
The final bevacizumab population PK model included the following statistically significant covariates: 
female gender, healthy subject (vs. NSCLC patient), body weight, baseline albumin and CRCL on CL; 
and female gender, healthy subject (vs. NSCLC patient) and body weight on Vc. SB8 treatment effect 
covariates for Phase I and Phase III PK comparisons with EU sourced Avastin were not identified as 
significant covariates in the backward elimination procedure (i.e., p>0.001), but were included in the 
final model for the assessment of PK similarity between SB8 and Avastin.  
Results for PK comparability 
PK similarity was assessed by testing a term representing the treatment arm that was included in the 
final model. The respective estimates for Phase I and Phase III of the treatment difference arm (e.g. 
Ph1 SB8 0.116 with 95% CI (0.0391, 0.193), Ph3 SB8 0.0846 with 95% CI (0.0239, 0.145)) confirmed

the significantly higher than bevacizumab CL in the SB8 that have been observed in the primary non-
compartmental analysis. 
Individual concentration-time profiles were simulated for dosing of SB8, US sourced Avastin and EU 
sourced Avastin to steady state. From the simulated PK profiles, summary measures of exposure were 
calculated, including Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss and AUC0-τ,ss. The mean exposure parameter ratios and 
corresponding prediction intervals of SB8 compared to EU or US sourced Avastin, and US compared to 
EU sourced Avastin, are provided in the below table. 
Table 15: Model-predicted exposure parameter ratios 
The final model did not include treatment effect covariates US Avastin versus EU Avastin. Thus, the 
mean exposure parameter ratios and corresponding confidence intervals of US Avastin to EU Avastin 
obtained from simulations only reflect the variability of the estimate, not the variability of the 
treatment ratio. 
Results for immunogenicity response and concomitant chemotherapy 
The effects of immunogenicity response and concomitant chemotherapy on bevacizumab CL were 
assessed in separate ad hoc model runs using the final population PK model. Of the 341 NSCLC 
patients included in the population PK analysis, 26 subjects (16.1%) in the SB8 treatment group and 
23 subjects (12.8%) in the EU sourced Avastin treatment group had samples that were ADA-positive.  
The impact of the immunogenicity response on clearance was assessed by inclusion of a time-
dependent binary (ADA status positive/negative) variable. There was no statistically significant 
difference with an effect estimate of 5.6% [95% CI: -4.6%, 15.8%]. The final model without 
interaction terms was also updated by including the ADA titre effect on CL. For this more sensitive 
model a significant increase in clearance was observed (Titre on CL: 0.0426 (0.00145;0.0838) which 
was not seen in the original ad-hoc covariate analysis where a term for time-dependent ADA status 
was included. This makes sense as formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) could increase clearance 
(Impact of ADAs on pharmacokinetics). The applicant could not include an interaction term of Titre on 
CL x model to judge the effect of different ADA formation on the comparison of CL between treatments 
due to computational issues. Covariate effects for the titre effect on CL were estimated, separately for 
each treatment group. The effect of titre on the CL of EU Avastin was not significant, whereas the 
estimate of the effect of titre on the CL in of SB8 was statistically significant.  
Similarly, the impact of the concomitant chemotherapy (carboplatin or paclitaxel) was evaluated by 
including a time-dependent binary (Chemo status positive/negative) term for it in the model for CL. 
The result was statistically significant, increasing bevacizumab CL by an estimate (95% CI) of 15.6% 
(8.74%, 22.5%). As the clearance is influenced by chemotherapy a term for chemotherapy should 
have been included in the model building process right from the beginning. The applicant performed 
the model building with a time-dependent term for chemotherapy included in the model.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In accordance with the EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), the clinical Phase I study 
(SB8-G11-NHV) in healthy male subjects(following a 3 mg/ kg body weight single i.v. injection) is 
considered as the main comparative PK study to demonstrate the similarity between SB8 and EU-
Avastin in terms of PK properties while the steady-state serum concentration data in the clinical Phase 
III study (SB8-G31-NSCLC) provides supportive evidence for the PK similarity in a representative 
patient population (metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC) by analysis of trough (pre-dose) 
and maximum (post-dose) plasma levels of SB8 or EU-Avastin following repeat dose IV administration 
of 15 mg/kg bevacizumab.

The validated PK assay method using SB8 as the reference standard had no differential effects on the 
results obtained from the SB8, EU Avastin, and US Avastin treatment groups. In the Phase I PK 
study (SB8-G11-NHV) the primary endpoint (AUCinf) and the main secondary endpoints (AUClast, 
Cmax) with their 90% CIs were entirely within the predefined acceptance range of 80-125% indicating 
biosimilarity between the test and reference product. The geometric LSMean ratios (90% CI) for SB8 
and EU sourced Avastin in AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax were 0.880 (0.8154 to 0.9498), 0.886 (0.8258 to 
0.9516) and 0.996 (0.9333 to 1.0628), respectively.  
It was noticed however, that the upper limit of the 90% CIs for AUCinf and AUClast did not include 1 
implying a statistically significant difference between the two treatments.  
For therapeutic proteins, it is known, that formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) can influence PK of a 
drug, especially clearance. The overall incidence of ADA proved to be comparable between the SB8 and 
EU-Avastin treatment groups. Thus, 1 subject (2.6%) in the SB8 group and 4 subjects (10.3%) in the 
EU-Avastin group exhibited post-dose ADA positive results. None of the subjects developed NAbs after 
administration of SB8 or EU-Avastin. A possible impact of ADAs on the PK parameters could not be 
assessed due to their overall low incidence in the treatment groups (see section 2.6 Clinical safety). 
In the Clinical Phase III study (SB8-G31-NSCLC) the values obtained for Ctrough and Cmax at cycles 
1, 3, 5 and 7 were largely comparable between SB8 and EU-Avastin. The Ctrough and Cmax values appear 
to increase steadily, converging to a steady state that seems to occur at Cycle 3. Even though a large 
variance was observed in each group (28 to 53% CV in the SB8 group, 28 to 67% CV in the EU Avastin 
group), at each of the time-points, with the exception of Cycle 1, it was noticed that the mean Ctrough 
and Cmax values were constantly lower for SB8 compared to EU Avastin. This difference is further 
confirmed in the subgroups of ADA positive and ADA negative patients (see Section Impact of ADAs on 
pharmacokinetics). The applicant provided the 90% CIs for the geometric LSMean ratios in Ctrough and 
Cmax. The latter fell within the 0.8-1.25 range in all four cycles (1, 3, 5, 7) and the 90% CI contained 1. 
Two of the three ratios for Ctrough, however, were lower than 0.8 (cycles 3 and 7) and the 90% CI 
range was below 1 in all cycles analysed (3, 5, 7). These results further enhance the notion that SB8 is 
less bioavailable than Avastin but the exposure is similar enough for the difference not to be clinically 
relevant. 
It is important to note however, that the overall interpretation of the results of the PK substudy was 
hampered due to some inconsistencies found. Looking at the individual drug concentration data listing 
of the PK population, it was noted that in several patients pre-dose concentrations of bevacizumab 
were higher than the post-dose concentrations. This was observed in both treatment groups (SB8 and 
Avastin), in all treatment cycles (1, 3, 5 and 7) and in patients of different study sites. In addition, 
sometimes pre-dose and post-dose concentrations were found to be very similar. Validity of these data 
was questioned as samples might have been mixed up at the study site or the analytical site. It was 
unclear what impact these findings had on the overall interpretation of the results and on the reliability 
of the PK data generated in this study. The applicant was therefore requested to investigate and 
discuss these issues in depth and to conduct an analysis of the PK data excluding these suspicious 
samples. The PK results after excluding suspicious samples showed comparable Ctrough and Cmax 
between SB8 and EU Avastin, and these data were also consistent with the PK data of the whole PK 
population. In addition, a GCP inspection was performed. No critical findings were observed in the 
inspected study sites. The inappropriate handling and documentation of biological samples at the 
investigation sites together with the deficiency of the procedure regarding the root cause analysis and 
the investigation of the anomalous PK results by the Sponsor could have led to the inconsistent PK 
data interpreted in the Clinical Study Report. Nevertheless, the outcome was that it has no negative 
impact on the reliability of data collected for this trial.

As formation of anti-drug antibodies increases clearance, a possible impact was investigated (see 
Section Impact of ADAs on pharmacokinetics). For the ADA negative subgroup the mean Ctrough and 
Cmax values were constantly lower for SB8 compared to EU Avastin studied at each of the time-points 
(except Cycle 1). Due to the lower sample size of the ADA positive subgroup, results are more 
variable, but except for Cycle 7 and Cycle 3 pre-dose, mean results were again lower for SB8 
compared to EU Avastin. This indicates a higher clearance of SB8 independent of ADA status which fits 
to the clinical Phase I study (SB8-G11-NHV) results where also a higher clearance was observed with 
negligible ADA formation. 
In addition, a population PK analysis on the PK data pooled from the clinical Phase I study in healthy 
volunteers and the clinical Phase III study in patients with NSCLC was performed. A model was 
developed in order to determine the effect of key extrinsic and intrinsic covariates on bevacizumab PK 
parameters, assess PK similarity between SB8 and EU Avastin and to evaluate the effect of anti-drug 
antibody (ADA) and chemotherapy incidence on the PK of bevacizumab. For model building the 
backward elimination procedure was applied to reduce the number of covariates in the model. This 
stepwise regression is prone to overfitting the data, i.e. the model fits much better in the sample it 
was derived from than it does on new data. The reported estimates may be biased and the confidence 
intervals do not have the correct coverage. To address this concern cross-validation was performed on 
the data set. For the original model the training MSE (0.073) was very close to the validation MSE 
(0.078). Nevertheless, it is still unclear if the original final model was used in these calculations or the 
resulting model when applying the backward elimination procedure to each training data set. 
A good matching was observed between measured and predicted PK data in healthy volunteers. 
However, it is not clear whether the final model is sensitive (or more sensitive than the primary 
protocol-defined analysis) to detect differences between biosimilar and originator; the model was built 
in a data-driven way and may be subject to over-fitting. RMSE is given as a measure for the model fit 
which is the average deviation of the estimates from the observed values or is the square root of the 
variance of the residuals. In comparison the R2 is the fraction of the total sum of squares that is 
explained by the regression, related to the RMSE, but easier to interpret because its value always lies 
between 0 and one. Furthermore, R2 can be adjusted for the number of explanatory terms in a model 
relative to the number of data points. The high value of adjusted R2 of the final model (0.885) 
indicates a good quality of the linear approximation. 
Gender, healthy subject (versus patient), body weight, baseline albumin, and creatinine clearance 
were identified as statistically significant covariates for bevacizumab PK in the final population PK 
model on CL. Gender, healthy subject (versus patient), and body weight had statistically significant 
covariate effects on Vc. 
The magnitude of most covariate effects (except for the gender effect which may be explainable by the 
addition of a chemotherapy term) were very similar for the new and the original Han model. The 
influence of body weight on clearance is considerably higher in the Han models compared to the 
original model with or without chemotherapy. The effect of CRCL was identified as a significant 
covariate in the final model of SB8 but not in the model by Han et al. Baseline ALP and treatment with 
interferon alpha were identified as the important predictor variable for CL in the model by Han et al. 
whereas it was eliminated in the final model of SB8. The applicant explained this by a difference in 
demographics of the model-building population used in each model. Furthermore, the observed 
differences could be due to the fact that the model by Han et al. only included patients with solid 
tumour and the final model of SB8 included both healthy volunteers and patients with advanced 
NSCLC. They may be explained in part by target-mediated drug disposition of bevacizumab in patients. 
Separate models of the PK parameters for SB8 and Avastin data were implemented leading to the 
same significant covariates (gender, healthy/patient, body weight on CL; healthy/patient, body weight 
on Vc) except for baseline tumour size on Vc which was only significant in the SB8 model. BALB and 
Assessment report

CRCL on CL were not significant covariates anymore in both separate models compared to the original 
final model. The adjusted CL estimate was only slightly higher for the SB8 group compared to the 
Avastin group (0.0125 versus 0.0118 L/h). The effect estimates of the covariates differ by at most 
0.12 L/h and lie within the 95% CI of each other. 
The original final PK population model also showed a significant difference in clearance between SB8 
and EU Avastin (0.116 with 95% CI (0.0391, 0.193)) leading to a significant lower difference in Cmax,ss, 
Cmin,ss and AUC0-τ,ss. This result is consistent with the results gained in the Phase I study for AUC and 
Phase III study for Cmax. The impact of the immunogenicity response (ADA) on clearance was not 
statistically significant whereas the impact of the concomitant chemotherapy (carboplatin or paclitaxel) 
was statistically significant increasing bevacizumab CL. However, it is not clear whether the final model 
is sensitive (or more sensitive than the primary protocol-defined analysis) to detect differences 
between biosimilar and originator; the model was built in a data-driven way and may be subject to 
over-fitting. For deciding on the appropriateness of the model and the robustness of the results, the 
applicant provided additional analyses (see Table 13 and Table 14). 
Nevertheless, all models only slightly differ and for all models the 95% CIs for the effect on clearance 
of SB8 in Phase I and Phase III still excluded 0, thus, showing a significantly higher bevacizumab CL in 
the SB8 treatment arm. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic data have been submitted as part of this application. Validated PD markers 
considered relevant to predicting efficacy of bevacizumab in patients do not exist. Therefore, no PD 
markers were included in the SB8-G11-NHV PK study, and clinical endpoints were utilised in the phase 
III study in NSCLC patients.  
The primary mechanism of action of bevacizumab is the inhibition of tumour vessel growth by blocking 
VEGF. The mode of action of bevacizumab is considered to be the same across all approved cancer 
indications. Therefore, extrapolation to other cancer indications of the reference product than advanced 
NSCLC is considered acceptable as similarity of Onbevzi/SB8 to the bevacizumab reference product 
(EU-Avastin) has been demonstrated. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In the Phase I PK study the primary endpoint (AUCinf) and the main secondary endpoints (AUClast, Cmax) 
with their 90% CIs were entirely within the predefined acceptance range of 80-125% indicating 
biosimilarity between the test and reference product and in the Phase III PK substudy the values 
obtained for Ctrough and Cmax at cycles 1, 3, 5 and 7 were largely comparable between SB8 and EU-
Avastin. From the PK data presented of the Phase I and Phase III study it seems, that SB8 exhibits a 
faster clearance and a lower bioavailability/drug exposure than EU-Avastin. The observed difference in 
clearance between the two treatments is a possible contributing factor to the difference in the AUCs 
between SB8 and EU-Avastin in the Phase I study and could be related to an elevated content in 
%High mannose in SB8 as compared to Avastin. Based on the data provided it seems that the slight 
difference in ADA formation has no causal relationship to the observed lower exposure. The impact of a 
slightly lower exposure is, however, considered to have no visible impact on clinical efficacy.

Treatments 
IP: Patients were randomised to receive either SB8 or EU Avastin 15 mg/kg IV infusion every 3 weeks 
on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle for at least 4 cycles and up to 6 cycles. Supplied for use as a 
concentrate for solution (100 mg or 400 mg per vial). 
Non-IP: Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 IV infusion over 3 hours / carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 6 IV 
infusion over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle during the induction treatment period. Paclitaxel was 
to be administered after the completion of IP administration. Nab-paclitaxel or other formulation of 
paclitaxel was not allowed in this study. Carboplatin was to be administered after the completion of 
paclitaxel. 
Study phases and conduct 
Screening period: within 42 days before randomisation. 
Induction treatment period: This period consists of 4 to 6 cycles of a 3-week cycle. SB8 or Avastin was 
to administered intravenously before starting chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) at a dose of 
15 mg/kg on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle for at least 4 cycles and up to 6 cycles.  
Maintenance treatment period: In patients who showed a response to the treatment (defined as 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) after completion of the 
induction treatment period, SB8 or Avastin was to be administered every 3 weeks until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or end of study occurs.  
End of Treatment (EOT) was defined as discontinuation of the treatment due to disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, death, or last administration of the IP before the end of the study. EOT visit was 
performed at least 21 days after the last IP administration and prior to subsequent therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 47/120 
 
 
 
Follow up:  telephone contact every 3 months from EOT until discontinuation of the patient from the 
study (e.g., death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or initiation of subsequent therapy for 
NSCLC) or EOS.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the equivalence of SB8 to Avastin in terms of 
the best Overall Response Rate (ORR) by 24 weeks of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or 
recurrent non-squamous NSCLC. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of SB8 compared to Avastin by PFS, OS and duration of response (DOR) 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SB8 compared to Avastin. 
• To evaluate the PK of SB8 compared to Avastin. 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of SB8 compared to Avastin. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
• 
Best ORR by 24 weeks of chemotherapy (best ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects whose 
best overall response was either complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] according to RECIST 
v1.1 during the induction treatment period by 24 weeks). 
Tumour assessment (MRT or CT assessment of disease status according to RECIST v1.1) was 
performed before planned Day 1 of Cycle 3, 5, and 7 and then every 4 cycles and assessed by both 
Investigators and independent central reviewer. The primary efficacy analysis was based on the data 
from the independent central review. 
For EMA, the primary efficacy analysis was to be performed in the per-protocol set (PPS) for the 
difference of the best ORR (best ORR of SB8 – best ORR of Avastin) by 24 weeks, and the equivalence 
between the two treatment groups will be declared if the 95% CI of the difference is entirely contained 
within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [-12.5%, 12.5%]. Similar analysis was to be performed 
for the FAS to support the primary analysis. 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed using the log binomial model with treatment. The 
sensitivity analysis was performed using the log binomial model with the covariates of age (< 70, ≥ 70 
years), sex (female, male), region (EU or non-EU) and treatment to explore the robustness of the 
primary efficacy results. 
•  Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
- PFS (defined as the time from the date of Randomisation to disease progression or death regardless 
of cause. Subjects who were not progressed at the time of analysis were censored at the date of EOT 
visit or the last tumour assessment date if the date of EOT was not available). 
- OS (defined as the time from the date of Randomisation to the date of death regardless of the cause 
of death. Subjects who were alive at the time of analysis were censored at the date of last known 
alive). 
- Duration of response (DOR) (defined as the time from documented tumour response (complete or 
partial) until documented disease progression. Only the subjects who achieved an initial tumour 
response were evaluated for DOR). 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 48/120 
 
 
 
•  Exploratory efficacy endpoint: 
Best ORR by 11 weeks and 17 weeks of chemotherapy.  
Further endpoints concerned safety and tolerability of SB8 compared to Avastin, evaluated the PK of 
SB8 compared to Avastin (Ctrough at pre-dose of Cycle 1, 3, 5, and 7 and Cmax at post-dose of Cycle 1, 
3, 5, and 7), evaluated the immunogenicity of SB8 compared to Avastin (ADAs at pre-dose of Cycle 1, 
3, 5, 7, and at the EOT visit. 
Other efficacy parameters were evaluated post-hoc. These considered ORR at cycle 2, 4 and 6; 
response rate-time curves, Tumour burden and ORR at cycle 6 regardless of period. 
Sample size 
With 305 patients in each treatment group, the two-sided 90% CI of the best ORR ratio was expected 
to lie within [0.737, 1.357] with approximately 80% power, and the two-sided 95% CI of the best ORR 
difference between SB8 and EU Avastin was expected to lie within [−12.5%, 12.5%] with 80% power 
when the expected best ORR was assumed to be 35%. Assuming a 10% drop-out rate, a total of 678 
patients (339 patients per treatment group) were planned to be randomised. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB8 or EU Avastin (15 mg/kg 
administered by IV infusion on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle) concurrently with PC chemotherapy 
(paclitaxel 200 mg/mg2 and carboplatin AUC 6 by IV infusion on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle) for at 
least 4 cycles and up to 6 cycles of the induction treatment period. The randomisation was stratified by 
age group (< 70 years and ≥ 70 years at the time of the randomisation) and gender. 
A subject randomisation list was produced by the Interactive Web Recognition System (IWRS)  
Blinding (masking) 
The subjects, Investigators, and site personnel involved in the study were blinded to the assignment of 
the IP. The IP remained blinded throughout the study period except staffs designated for unblinding 
after the interim analysis.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
• Enrolled Set (ENR): all subjects who provided informed consent for this study. 
• Randomised Set (RAN): all subjects who received a randomisation number at the randomisation.  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomised subjects. The subjects were analysed based on the treatment 
they were randomised to by intention-to-treat principle. Missing data from subjects who withdrew from 
the study due to PD, lack of efficacy and AEs without any tumour assessment were considered as non-
responder. 
• Per-protocol Set (PPS): all FAS subjects who completed at least first 2 cycles of combination 
chemotherapy with a tumour assessment and did not have any major protocol deviations that 
impacted the primary efficacy assessment. The PPS is the primary analysis set. 
• Safety Set (SAF): all subjects who received the study drug at least once. 
Assessment report

• Pharmacokinetic Population (PK Population): This set consisted of subjects allocated to PK sub-study 
who had at least one measured serum concentration of bevacizumab. 
Analysis methods 
Primary efficacy comparison 
The primary efficacy analysis aims at demonstrating equivalence in the ORR between SB8 and Avastin 
in the PPS. The null hypothesis tested for the primary efficacy analysis will be either (1) SB8 is inferior 
to Avastin or (2) SB8 is superior to Avastin based on a pre-specified equivalence margin. 
For the EMA submission the primary efficacy analysis will be performed in the PPS for the difference of 
the best ORR (best ORR of SB8 – best ORR of Avastin) by 24 weeks. 
The tumour response is assessed by independent central review and by Investigator, but the primary 
efficacy analysis will be based on the data from the independent central review. The difference in best 
ORR (best ORR of SB8 – best ORR of Avastin) and its 95% CI for the PPS are estimated by the 
binomial regression model with treatment group as an explanatory variable. The equivalence is 
declared if the two-sided 95% CI lies within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [-12.5%, 12.5%]. 
Secondary efficacy comparisons 
The secondary efficacy endpoints of PFS, OS and DOR are analysed for PPS and FAS. 
Median survival times and the corresponding 95% CI for Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall 
Survival (OS) are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method in the FAS and PPS and visualised with 
Kaplan-Meier plots.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 4: Subject disposition (Study SB8-G31-NSCLC) 
Seven hundred and sixty three (763) patients with metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC stage 
IV or recurrent without known activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations or 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocations were randomised in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by 
age group (< 70 and ≥ 70 years) and gender. 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted in 100 study centres, located in Belarus, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, 
Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand and Ukraine. First subject 
signed informed consent on 5 July, 2016 and the last subject last visit was on 9 August 2018. 
Conduct of the study 
Two global amendments and 2 country-specific amendments were made to the original protocol (dated 
5 October 2015). 
Protocol deviations were classified as major and minor. Protocol deviations did not lead to subject 
withdrawal unless they indicated a significant risk to the subject's safety. A total of 451 (59.1%) 
subjects had at least one major protocol deviation (224 [59.1%] subjects in the SB8 treatment group 
and 227 [59.1%]) subjects in the Avastin treatment group). A total of 14 (1.8%) subjects were

excluded from the PPS due to major protocol deviations. The most common major protocol deviation 
that led to exclusion from the PPS was associated with efficacy criteria (6 [1.6%] subjects in the SB8 
treatment group and 7 [1.8%] subjects in the Avastin treatment group).

Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Variable 
To explore the robustness of the primary efficacy result, the primary efficacy analysis for the ratio in 
the PPS and the difference in the FAS in the best ORR was performed. 
Table 24: Analysis of ratio and difference in best overall response rate during induction treatment 
period by 24 weeks 
Table 25: Sensitivity analysis of ratio in best overall response rate during induction treatment period by 
24 weeks 
In the sensitivity analysis equivalence in terms of the adjusted difference in best ORR, results were 
similar. 
Analysis imputing for patients without tumour assessment 
More conservative imputation methods on all patients without tumour assessment to estimate the 
effect difference between SB8 and Avastin was provided post-hoc for the primary endpoint best ORR 
by week 24 of the ORR at Cycle 6 in the induction period as well as for ORR at week 24.

Table 26: Analysis of difference in best overall response rate by 24 weeks of the induction period (Per-
protocol set, study SB8-G31- NSCLC) (Ad-hoc analysis) 
For the FAS, the difference [95% CI] in best ORR by 24 weeks of the induction period after missing 
data imputation of 332 patients was 6.0% [−0.9%, 12.9%] (table not presented).  
The other provided analyses took Cycle 2, 4 and 6 or just Cycle 2 and 4 as predictor variables for best 
ORR using a non-monotone missing pattern (not presented). Nevertheless, results showed that the 
95% CI of the difference in best ORR would be within the comparability range of 12.5% for both, the 
FAS and PPS. 
The ad-hoc analysis of ORR at Cycle 6 in the induction period was performed for the PPS after 
imputation of 278 patients without ORR at Cycle 6 in the induction period. The difference [95% CI] in 
ORR at Cycle 6 in the induction period for the PPS was 5.6% [−1.8%, 13.0%]. The results indicated no 
statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups with the 95% CI including zero. 
Table 27: Analysis of difference in overall response rate at cycle 6 in the induction period (Per-protocol 
set, study SB8-G31- NSCLC) (Ad-hoc analysis) 
The difference [95% CI] in ORR at Cycle 6 in the induction period for the FAS was 6.2% [−0.6%, 
13.1%]. The results indicated no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups. 
Results for PPS and FAS were similar and indicated no statistically significant difference between the 
two treatment groups. Furthermore, the difference was smaller than in the analysis without missing 
data imputation for the subset of patients completing 6 cycles in the induction period presented in the 
initial dossier (former results showed a difference of 7.1% [95% CI: −3.5%, 17.7%] for the PPS). 
For justification of the clinical relevance of the margin, the applicant performed three different 
weighted linear regression of best ORR to median PFS. For two regression analyses (First results of the 
clinical Phase III study (SB8-G31-NSCLC) in addition to the results from four clinical studies with

Avastin (Botrel et al., 2011), with 6 data points) and an analysis of weighted linear regression based 
on 18 Observations adding 12 Clinical Studies in Advanced NSCLC (Blumenthal et al., 2015) to the 
previous data points), the pre-defined upper equivalence margin of a 13% margin corresponded to 
estimated PFS < 3 months. With the third analysis of weighted linear regression based on 16 
Observations excluding the results of SB8-G31-NSCLC, a 13% margin corresponded to 3.01-month 
estimated PFS. The 95% bootstrap CI for the difference in median PFS between the SB8 and EU 
Avastin treatment groups was calculated as [−1.5, 2.0] months.  
Analysis of ORR at cycle 6 regardless of study period 
Analysis of ORR at cycle 6 regardless of study period with imputed missing values was presented, 
similar to the imputation method requested for the primary endpoint. The number of patients with 
non-responder imputation was comparable between treatment arms. Slightly more patients 
discontinued the study for primary reasons other than death or disease progression without any 
tumour assessment with SB8 (12.8% vs. 9.1%), multiple imputation was used for these patients, as 
requested. ORR at Cycle 6 regardless of study period results in a difference of 4.8% [95% CI: –2.8%, 
12.3%] between treatment arms for the PPS. For the FAS the difference in ORR at Cycle 6 regardless 
of study period were 4.9% [95% CI: –2.0%, 11.9%]. These analysis results are within the pre-defined 
equivalence margin of 12.5% in contrast to ORR at Cycle 6 in the induction period.

Analysis of primary endpoint assessed by Investigators: 
In addition tumour lesions were assessed by investigators whose results strongly differ from the 
independent central review.

response during the induction treatment period by 24 weeks (RECIST 1.1) - (Full analysis set, study 
SB8-G31-NSCLC) 
The applicant performed an ad-hoc sensitivity analysis to explore the robustness of the primary 
efficacy result by imputing the results of the patients who stop due to PD, but got evaluated as SD by 
central review as responders (except at cycle 6). This concerned almost equally as many patients in 
the SB8 as in the EU Avastin group (11/12 patients in the FAS and 10/10 in the PPS).

The percentage of non-evaluable lesions (NE) was higher in the central review compared to the local 
investigator based tumour evaluation. The number of unevaluable lesions differed especially in the 
reference arm (15% NE by central review and 8.6% by local review). Patients with non-evaluable (NE) 
lesions continued to receive study treatment.  
Further post hoc analyses 
Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Variables by Demographics 
Overall there were no relevant differences between the two treatment groups, with exception of the 
Russian population, where a difference in Best ORR of 20.1% [7.5%, 32.7%] was observed (SB8-
Avastin).  
The applicant further investigated reasons for the difference. Russian patients in the SB8 group were 
slightly younger (90.8% versus 90.0% age <70 years) and included more women (31.1% versus 
30.9%) than in the SB8 subgroup. This could have been a contributing factor.

Maximum change in tumour burden from baseline 
The mean of the maximum percentage change from baseline in tumour burden by 24 weeks of 
chemotherapy was −27.8% for the SB8 treatment group and −27.3% for EU Avastin treatment group. 
The difference between the two treatment groups was 0.6% with the 95% CI of [−4.18%, 2.99%]. 
Results were comparable by w11 and w17: Differences were 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.

Table 34: Analysis of overall response at Cycle 6 of the induction treatment period (RECIST v1.1) –

The applicant provided ad-hoc analyses for overall response rate (ORR) at Cycle 2 and Cycle 4 with the 
same imputation method asked for the ad-hoc analysis of ORR at Cycle 6. For these ad-hoc analyses, 
multiple imputation for datasets with monotone missing patterns was first performed and 
subsequently, non-responder imputation was performed for patients whose primary discontinuation 
reason was death or progressive disease. Treatment group (SB8, EU Avastin), age group (< 70 years, 
≥ 70 years), sex (male, female), and tumour measurements of overall response at Cycle 2 (for ad-hoc 
analysis at Cycle 4 only) were included as important predictor variables in the multiple imputation

model. Multiple imputation was performed separately for each treatment group using logistic 
regression model. 
The ad-hoc analysis of ORR at Cycle 2 in the induction period was performed for the PPS after 
imputation for patients without tumour measurements for overall response at Cycle 2 during the 
induction period (see Table 35). The 95% CI included zero, indicating no statistically significant 
difference between the two treatment groups. These results were also consistent with the difference 
[95% CI] in ORR at Cycle 2 in the induction period (1.7% [−5.1%, 8.5%]) in patients with available 
assessments (no imputation) at this time point (see Table 32). Results were similar for the FAS.

groups. These results were also consistent with the difference [95% CI] in ORR at Cycle 4 in the 
induction period (3.3% [−5.0%, 11.6%]) in patients with available assessment (no imputation) at this 
time point. 
In addition to the primary analysis being performed on the imputed data for ORR, the applicant 
performed a Mixed-effect Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) for treatment differences in terms of 
the continuous endpoint changes in tumour burden from baseline to post-baseline.

The adjusted difference [95% CI] in change of tumour burden from baseline during the whole period 
was –1.96 [95% CI: –5.804, 1.891]. None of these differences were significant and all point estimates 
pointed to a higher change of tumour burden from baseline in the Avastin group compared to the SB8 
group.

Difference in best ORR adjusted by the subcategory of distant metastasis 
The site of metastases and lymph node involvement were reported to play a crucial role in predicting 
the treatment outcome in advanced NSCLC (Eberhardt et al., 2015; Lim et al., 2018; Gress et al., 
2017). The ad-hoc sensitivity analysis of the difference in best ORR adjusted by the subcategory of 
distant metastasis showed an adjusted difference of 4.7%, with the two-sided 95%CI of [−2.9%, 
12.2%], which was entirely contained within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [−12.5%, 12.5%]. 
Subgroup analyses for each distant metastasis subcategory were performed in addition.

Ad-hoc analysis of PFS and OS using a Cox regression model on PPS 
Event rates for PFS were similar between SB8 and Avastin. Regarding OS, 152 (45.1%) patients and 
146 (44.5%) patients in the SB8 and EU Avastin treatment groups, respectively experienced the 
events. 
The 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month PFS rates and the corresponding 95% CIs were similar for PFS 
and OS. 
The HR of PFS and the corresponding 95% CI was 1.01 [0.84, 1.22]. The HR of death and the 
corresponding 95% CI was 1.08 [0.86, 1.35].

The median [95% CI] DOR was 7.70 [6.00, 8.30] in the SB8 treatment group and 7.10 [6.10, 8.30] in 
the EU Avastin treatment group in the PPS (Figure 8 and Table 43).

censoring. The treatment groups were comparable concerning the percentage of informative and non-
informative censoring in the FAS and the PPS.

response – central review (per-protocol set, study SB8-G31-NSCLC) (Ad-hoc analysis) 
A Therneau-Grambsch nonproportionality test for the Cox model for PFS, OS, and DOR showed, that 
the proportional hazard assumption of the Cox regression model was not violated. The effect of 
treatment on PFS and DOR seems to increase with time from around Month 10 onwards whereas the 
effect of treatment on OS rather seems to decrease.  
Ad-hoc Sensitivity Analysis to Assess the Impact of Key Quality Attributes Related to Efficacy of 
Bevacizumab on the Observed Difference in Best ORR 
The observed difference in best ORR was assessed from the quality perspective to investigate whether 
any quality attributes may have any impact on treatment outcome. Among the quality attributes 
assessed for the development of SB8, the quality attributes in relation to the efficacy of bevacizumab 
were selected as covariates. 
To assess the impact of these quality attributes on the observed difference in best ORR, the sensitivity 
analysis was performed in the PPS, using the binomial model with the covariates of each selected 
quality attribute, treatment, and its interaction term by treatment. The sensitivity analysis was 
summarised as the effect estimates with p-value based on the Wald test (alpha level of 0.05). 
Individual values of all 7 SB8 batches used during the induction treatment period were used for the ad-
hoc analysis. Of 14 EU Avastin lots used during the induction treatment period, 5 lots could not be 
characterised. For HUVEC anti-proliferation, VEGF-A 165 binding, VEGF neutralisation, and FcRn 
binding assay, the missing values were imputed using a median from the individual values of the other 
9 EU Avastin lots. For protein concentration, the values for 4 EU Avastin lots were from the Certificate 
of Analysis (CoA), and the remaining one lot was imputed using the median.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy comparison is based on a single active-controlled multicentre efficacy/safety study 
(SB8-G31-NSCLC) in NSCLC patients, an approved indication for Avastin (EU) as first line treatment for 
non-squamous NSCLC with carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
The applicant claimed all therapeutic indications currently authorised for the reference product EU 
Avastin with the exception of the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian 
tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in combination with paclitaxel. A justification for extrapolation of 
indications (such as metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, advanced/metastatic renal cell 
cancer, and persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer) was provided by the applicant, see 
section 3.5. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In total 763 patients were 1:1 randomised to receive either SB8 or EU sourced Avastin. Age group (< 
70 years vs ≥ 70 years) at randomisation and gender were used as stratification factors. The study 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 72/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was conducted in nearly 100 centres, including 80% patients from non-EU countries. A GCP inspection 
of the clinical study SB8-G31-NSCLC was performed at two investigator sites (located in Hungary and 
Russia) and the sponsor site (located in the Republic of Korea) in January and February 2020. No 
critical findings were observed at any of the inspection sites. The trial has been conducted according to 
GCP and ethical standards. The data obtained at the sites inspected are reliable and can be accepted 
as support of the marketing Authorisation Application. 
The general study design was in line with previous scientific advice. Patients with metastatic or 
recurrent non-squamous NSCLC are considered appropriate to sensitively compare efficacy between 
Avastin and the proposed biosimilar candidate. The used treatment regimens for bevacizumab and 
chemotherapy was in line with the Avastin SmPC. In- and exclusion criteria are considered appropriate 
and known baseline demographic and disease characteristics were comparable. Randomisation was 
performed according to the stratification factors age and gender balancing for country.  
Patients with known positive EGFR/ALK status were not randomised according to the exclusion criteria, 
but only about 30% of patients had known EGFR or ALK status, leaving a high percentage of 
randomised patients with unknown EGFR/ALK status. Testing for EGFR mutation and ALK gene 
translocations was not included in the screening phase, which does not comply with current standards, 
as genotyping is now routinely incorporated in many clinical settings. However, it was not yet standard 
in the planning phase of this study. Frequency of EGFR/ALK mutation testing showed remarkable 
differences between countries during SB8 clinical development. Patients with ALK rearrangements 
might be found among the subpopulation of unknown ALK status with a lower probability.  
In the induction period patients received 15 mg/kg bevacizumab concurrently with PC chemotherapy 
(paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6) by IV infusion on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle for at 
least 4 cycles and up to 6 cycles. Dose reduction with predefined dose levels, schedule modifications or 
cessation of chemotherapy was permitted for toxicity. Tumour measurements after every second cycle 
(until cycle 7) and every 4 cycles thereafter until EOT or EOS are acceptable. The first tumour 
measurement was after a median of 44 days (Cycle 3) and the second after a median of 86 days 
(Cycle 5). If eligible, patients received bevacizumab in the maintenance period every 3 weeks until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or end of study. Treatment was discontinued by 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or last administration of the IP before the end of the 
study.  
The number of cycles of the IP (Avastin/SB8) and non-IP (Paclitaxel/Carboplatin) as well as timing of 
cycles and duration of IP exposure was comparable between treatment groups in the FAS and PPS. 
Over 50% of patients in each treatment arm were treated for 6 cycles in the induction period.  
Endpoints: 
The primary endpoint was risk difference in best overall response rate in the PP set by w24 with a 
comparability range of 12.5% for the 95% CI of the difference. Secondary endpoints were PFS, OS and 
DOR. Further endpoints were best ORR by w11 and by w17.  
-  Best ORR maximises the binary outcome and might be selected to reduce the confounding 
factors of variant cycles and delayed application due to AEs. Non-responder imputation or 
analysis of available data are often attractive because they are simple to implement but can 
easily produce invalid results in equivalence trials. ORR at w19 was prior recommended as 
primary endpoint in the scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/85315/2015). 
-  A more conservative imputation method on all patients without tumour assessment was 
presented by the applicant upon request for the sensitive and clinically relevant endpoints 
“ORR at cycle 6 of the induction period” with non-responder imputation for patients 
discontinuing due to death or PD according to tumour assessment and multiple imputation for 
Assessment report

Page 73/120 
 
 
 
all other patients who discontinue the trial prior to week 24 (FAS and PPS). This analysis was 
requested with the same imputation for the primary endpoint “best ORR by w24” of the 
induction period. In addition this analysis was also requested for the endpoint “ORR at cycle 6 
regardless of study period”, as this treatment policy estimand ignores a change of the 
treatment period (induction/maintenance) within the observation period of the primary 
endpoint of 24 weeks, i.e. if concurrent chemotherapy was still applied. As patients will change 
to the maintenance phase prior to 24 weeks also in clinical practice, it reflects the comparison 
described in the ICH E9 Glossary (under Intention to Treat Principle) as the effect of a 
treatment policy. 
- 
The applicant discussed the comparability margin of the primary endpoint and the observed 
95% CI of the difference between SB8 and EU Avastin: According to a weighted linear 
regression analysis, a difference in 12.5% of best ORR corresponds to a change in PFS of 2.5 
months whereas for a response rate of 13% an increase of 2.6 months can be achieved. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The difference in best ORR by w24 was 5.3%, [-2.2%, 12.9%] for the PPS, the upper limit of the 95% 
CI slightly exceeding the pre-defined comparability margin of [-12.5%, 12.5%]. In the sensitivity 
analysis performed with the FAS, the difference was 4.8%, the 95% CI (-2.3%, 11.9%) being within 
the comparability margin. The risk ratio of best ORR including 90% CI, which was the primary endpoint 
for FDA filing, was also within the predefined comparability margin of [0.737, 1.357] in both, the FAS 
and PPS. The number of patients with disease progression (PD), complete response (CR) and partial 
response (PR) was similar between treatment arms. 
The secondary endpoints and further analyses are largely in support of biosimilarity. The secondary 
endpoint median PFS was 8.5 [7.20, 9.70] vs. 7.9 [7.30, 9.40] months for SB8 and Avastin, 
respectively, HR 1.02. The median OS was 14.80 [13.00, 17.00] vs. 15.80 [13.80, 17.70] for SB8 and 
Avastin, respectively and a HR of 1.08. The PFS and OS rates of 6-month, 12 month (and 18 month in 
case of OS) were comparable. The Difference in DOR was 0.48 in favour of EU Avastin, but in contrast 
with the results of the primary endpoint. The requested post-hoc analysis with an alternative 
imputation method showed slightly higher result of DOR in the SB8 group, which is more consistent 
with the outcome of the primary analysis suggesting a slightly higher efficacy of SB8. An explanation is 
given for the difference to the median DOR from the original descriptive statistics where Avastin had 
an outcome of 5.90 months and SB8 of 5.60 months. The Kaplan Meier estimate of the median gives 
the number of months when the probability of survival is 0.5 and considers also censoring. 
Furthermore, endpoints of best ORR by w11 and w17 were similar, the 95% CI of the difference being 
within a ±12.5% margin.  
The presented post-hoc analyses of ORR at cycle 2 and cycle 4 were comparable. Analyses of PFS and 
OS using a Cox regression model showed similar results as the initial analysis, in support of 
biosimilarity. In addition, the maximum change in tumour burden from baseline was investigated post-
hoc, showing similar results between treatments. The mean of the maximum percentage change from 
baseline in tumour burden by 24 weeks of chemotherapy was −27.8% for SB8 and −27.3% for EU-
sourced Avastin. The difference between the two treatment groups was small (0.6% [95% CI of 
−4.18%, 2.99%]). The ad-hoc sensitivity analysis of the difference in best ORR adjusted by the 
subcategory of distant metastasis showed an adjusted difference of 4.7%, with the two-sided 95%CI 
of [−2.9%, 12.2%], which was entirely contained within the pre-defined equivalence margin of 
[−12.5%, 12.5%].

In the forest plot of demographic subgroup analyses for best ORR at cycle 6 the point estimates for the 
difference in best ORR during induction period lied within the equivalence margins (except for the 
Russian subgroup), but mostly showed a higher efficacy of SB8 compared to Avastin. An in-depth 
investigation of the data indicated that the very slight differences between prognostic baseline 
characteristics, as age, gender or histological type of carcinoma could have some small influence on 
the higher observed response rate with SB8 compared to Avastin, but do not fully explain the higher 
difference in ORR of this subgroup. A chance finding can only be assumed, if all the other (at least 
known) factors were ruled out, which is plausible in this case. 
The primary efficacy data were based on the independent central review (ICR) assessment, 
nevertheless results based on the investigator review assessment pointed to a slightly lower response 
rate of SB8 compared to EU Avastin. The discrepancy was explained by the applicant, that tumour 
assessments were conducted independently and vary between individual reviewers. Similarly, rather 
low concordance rates (about 75%) were observed in the literature. Patients discontinued the study 
due to PD assessed by the investigator and in this case, no further tumour assessments were 
performed. Patients which stopped due to PD but got evaluated as SD by central review were balanced 
between treatment arms and did only marginally change Best ORR results. For patients who were 
assessed as first PD by Central Review, more than 50% were assessed differently by investigators 
review in both treatment arms. The concordance in assessment of first PD by both review groups was 
slightly higher in the Avastin arm (49.1%) compared to 42.6% in the SB8 arm. Nevertheless, an 
impact on the response rate from such cases can be excluded, as only 3 patients were assessed as 
‘other than PD’ in the subsequent assessment results in the induction period, but none of them was 
later determined as responders by central review.   
There seems to be a slight difference between SB8 and Avastin relative to VEGF neutralisation potency 
of batches used in this study, as batch results nearly did not overlap, although they were within the EU 
similarity range. In the overall VEGF neutralisation assay comparing various batches, which were not 
restricted to clinical batches, this difference was not observed (see section 2.2 Quality aspects), 
therefore this difference is not of concern in the demonstration of biosimilarity on quality level. Results 
of all quality attribute VEGF-A 165 binding, HUVEC anti-proliferation, VEGF neutralisation, as well as in 
vitro assays were within the pre-defined similarity range between the biosimilar candidate and the 
reference product. In addition, the ad-hoc analysis of the best ORR with the quality attributes as 
covariates showed that no contributing factor was identified from the quality aspects. 
A more conservative imputation method on all patients without tumour assessment for best ORR by 
w24 of the induction period and for ORR at cycle 6 were presented upon request. These imputation 
analyses were further provided for ORR at cycle 2, and 4, for ORR at cycle 6 regardless of study 
period, and for the ADA positive vs. ADA negative subgroups: 
- 
In the most appropriate analysis (imputing for patients without ORR at Cycle 6 in the 
Induction Period (MI with Monotone Missing Patterns), the difference in best ORR (SB8 
– EU Avastin) was 5.3% with a 95% CI of [−2.2%, 12.7%] for PPS and 6.0% with 
95% CI of [−0.9%, 12.9%] for the FAS. The imputation therefore revealed a lower 
difference between treatment arms compared to the initial analysis, which is 
reassuring. The response rate-time curves showed that the difference in response 
favoured SB8 and was highest between w20 and w30 and then slightly decreased till 
w40. With other imputation methods presented (using ORR at Cycle 2, 4 and 6 or just 
ORR at Cycle 2 and 4 as predictor variables for best ORR using a non-monotone 
missing pattern, which were not considered most appropriate), the difference in best 
ORR would be completely within a comparability range of ±12.5%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 75/120 
 
 
 
- 
The analysis of ORR at Cycle 6 in the induction showed a difference (SB8 – EU Avastin) 
of 5.6% [95% CI: -1.8%, 13.0%] for PPS and 6.2% [95% CI: −0.6%, 13.1%] for the 
FAS. Results for PPS and FAS were similar and indicated no statistically significant 
difference between the two treatment groups. Also, in this analysis the difference was 
smaller than in the analysis without missing data imputation. 
-  Using the same kind of imputation, the analysis for the difference in ORR at Cycle 6 
regardless of study period could be interpreted as a treatment policy estimand and 
better reflect the outcome in clinical practice after 6 cycles. The difference in ORR at 
Cycle 6 regardless of study period resulted in 4.8% [95% CI: –2.8%, 12.3%] for the 
PPS and in 4.9% [95% CI: –2.0%, 11.9%] for the FAS, which was entirely within a 
comparability range of ±12.5%. 
- 
- 
The analyses for ORR at cycle 2 and 4 showed only slight difference in ORR, which is 
similar to the initially presented results. 
The analysis of best ORR by 24 weeks in the induction period of ADA positive and ADA 
negative patients showed similar results as the ad-hoc analysis presented before. The 
response was higher in ADA positive patients compared to ADA negative patients in the 
Avastin treatment arm. In contrast, response was lower in ADA positive patients 
compared to ADA negative patients with SB8. ORR at each Cycle showed no consistent 
trend. Beside a chance finding due to the low sample size in the ADA positive 
subgroup, some influence of unfavourable prognostic factors detected in the ADA 
positive patients with SB8 cannot be excluded. Comparison of PFS and DOR showed no 
relevant effect of ADA development on these efficacy endpoints in both treatment 
groups. 
The impact of ADA on efficacy is also further presented in the sub-section on immunological events in 
section 2.6. Clinical safety 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The difference in (best) ORR seems to slightly favour SB8 with an upper bound of the 95% CI around 
13% in the induction period.  
Nevertheless, the analysis for the difference in ORR at Cycle 6 regardless of study period for the PPS 
resulted in an upper bound of 12.3%. This endpoint could be interpreted as a treatment policy 
estimand and better reflect the outcome in clinical practice after 6 cycles, as it ignores a change of the 
treatment period (induction/maintenance) within the observation period of the primary endpoint of 24 
weeks, i.e. if concurrent chemotherapy was still applied. As patients will change to the maintenance 
period prior to 24 weeks also in clinical practice, it reflects the comparison described in the ICH E9 
Glossary (Intention to Treat Principle) as the effect of a treatment policy. Moreover, further efficacy 
endpoints as PFS, OS, DOR and change in tumour burden were similar. Further analyses evaluating the 
robustness of the study data were performed including ad-hoc sensitivity analyses after adjusting the 
covariates (e.g. tumour burden or number of Cycles for IP and non-IP), best ORR based on the data 
from Investigator’s review or different assessment time points (e.g. by Week 11 and Week 17), and 
ORR at Cycle 2, Cycle 4 and Cycle 6 (regardless of study period). All of these analyses results showed 
that the treatment effect of SB8 and EU Avastin was largely comparable.  
Based on the totality of data, comparability on efficacy level can be concluded.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The applicant has provided safety data from clinical Phase I single-dose PK trial in healthy male 
volunteers (Study SB8-G11-NHV), and one clinical Phase III trial in male and female NSCLC patients 
(Study SB8-G31-NSCLC).  
In the Phase I Study SB8-G11-NSCLC the subjects were randomised to one of three arms (SB8, EU 
Avastin or US-Avastin) to receive a single IV dose of 3 mg/kg bevacizumab.  
In the Phase III Study SB8-G31-NSCLC patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an IV 
dose of 15 mg/kg of SB8 or EU Avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (every three weeks) for at least 
4 and no more than 6 cycles (induction treatment phase). Patients who responded to treatment 
continued with bevacizumab as monotherapy in the maintenance treatment phase until evidence of 
disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, death, or 12 months from the randomisation of the 
last patient (End of Study [EOS]), whichever occurred first. Due to the heterogeneity of the study 
populations and the different treatment schemes used in both studies, no pooled safety analysis was 
provided.  
In the Phase I study, the safety population consisted of all 119 healthy male subjects aged 18 to 59 
years who were exposed to a single dose of 3mg/kg bevacizumab i.v. (SB8 40 subjects; EU sourced 
Avastin 40 subjects; US sourced Avastin 39 subjects).  
In the Phase III study, the safety population consisted of all NSCLC patients who received 
bevacizumab (either SB8 or EU-Avastin) at a dose of 15mg/kg i.v. at least once. Hence, a total of 758 
out of the 763 randomised patients were included in the SAF (SB8 group: 378 patients [99.7%]; EU-
Avastin group: 380 patients [99%]). In the below table, the exposure to the IP is summarised for the 
safety set of Phase III Study SB8-G31-NSCLC.

Disposition of subjects/patients 
Phase I Study SB8-G11-NHV 
Of the 119 subjects who were randomised, 113 subjects completed the study, and 6 subjects 
discontinued the study. 1 subject discontinued due to withdrawal of informed consent, 5 subjects 
discontinued due to other reasons (i.e. not meeting inclusion or exclusion criteria after dosing, one 
subject received an incorrect dose of the IP and one subject was administered disallowed therapy). 
None of the subjects discontinued the study due to AEs or other safety issues. 
Phase III Study SB8-G31-NSCLC 
A total of 965 patients were screened, of which 763 patients were randomised. The most common 
reason for screening failure was not meeting the eligibility criteria. The patient disposition was well 
balanced between the two treatment groups: 379 patients were randomised to the SB8 treatment 
group and 384 patients were randomised to the EU Avastin treatment group.  
Among randomised patients, 70.1% (535/763) of subjects completed the induction treatment period 
(68.1% [258/379] in the SB8 treatment group and 72.1% [277/384] in the Avastin treatment group). 
60.6% (462/763) of the patients discontinued during the maintenance treatment period in both 
treatment groups (58.8% [223/379] in the SB8 group; 62.2% [239/384] in the EU Avastin group). At 
the time of EOS (Aug 09, 2018) the proportion of patients who were ongoing in the maintenance 
treatment period was 9.2% (35/379) in the SB8 treatment group and 9.9% (38/384) in Avastin

treatment group. The main reasons for discontinuation in the induction and maintenance treatment 
period in both groups were disease progression (10.9% in the induction period, 47.6% in the 
maintenance period), AEs (6.9% in the induction period, 4.3% in the maintenance period) and death 
(5.5% in the induction period, 2.8% in the maintenance period). The numbers of the patients 
terminating treatment because of disease progression, AEs or death were comparable between both 
groups. 
Adverse events 
Phase I Study SB8-G11-NHV 
Treatment-emergent adverse events for the phase I study SB8-G11-NHV were defined as AEs which 
started after IP administration or pre-existed before IP administration and worsened in severity after IP 
administration.  A summary of the TEAEs in the clinical Phase I study is presented in the below table. 
Table 50: Summary of adverse events (Safety set, study SB8-G11-NHV) 
The majority of TEAEs were Grade 1 (mild) in severity. A total of 2 (1.7%) subjects experienced Grade 
3 (severe) TEAEs: 1 (2.5%) subject in the SB8 group and 1 (2.6%) subject in the US sourced Avastin 
group: 
• One subject  (SB8 group) had Grade 3 (severe) perirectal abscess which was considered serious and 
not related to the IP by the Investigator.  
• Another subject  (US sourced Avastin group) had Grade 3 (severe) syncope which was considered 
non-serious and not related to the IP by the Investigator. 
Assessment report

No SAEs were reported in the EU Avastin treatment group and US Avastin treatment group. No TEAEs 
were reported with severity Grade 4 (life-threatening) or Grade 5 (death) in any treatment group. 
There were no deaths or discontinuations due to TEAEs during the study.  
TEAEs considered to be related to the IP were reported in 1 (2.5%) subject in the SB8 treatment group 
(diarrhoea), 1 (2.5%) subject in the EU Avastin treatment group (acne) and 3 (7.7%) subjects in the 
US Avastin treatment group (musculoskeletal stiffness in 1 subject and headache in 2 subjects). 
No infusion related reaction symptoms were observed. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) occurring in > 5% of subjects in any treatment group 
reported during the study are provided in the table below. 
Table 51: Number (%) of subjects with TEAEs in ≥ 5% of subjects in any treatment group (Safety set,

The most frequently affected SOCs among the treatment groups were infections and infestations (4 
[10.0%] subjects in the SB8, 8 [20.0%] subjects in the EU Avastin and 7 [17.9%] subjects in the US 
Avastin treatment groups) and gastrointestinal disorders (9 [22.5%] subjects in the SB8, 2 [5.0%] 
subjects in the EU Avastin and 2 [5.1%] subjects in the US Avastin treatment groups).  
Phase III Study SB8-G31-NSCLC 
A TEAE was defined as any AE with an onset date on or after the date of the first administration of IP. 
AEs which were already present before the first IP and increased in severity after the first IP were 
considered as TEAEs. Pre-existing AEs before the first IP with no increase in severity after the first IP 
were not considered as TEAEs. 
A total of 694 (91.6%) patients reported 5284 TEAEs at any time after the first dose of the IP during 
the overall study period (summarised in Table 52 below). 
The majority of TEAEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity; i.e. there were 1470 grade 1 and 883 grade 2 
events in the SB8 treatment group, and 1383 grade 1 and 862 grade 2 events in the Avastin treatment 
group.

serious TEAEs). In the SB8 treatment group, 104 SAEs were reported in 75 (19.8%) patients and in 
the Avastin treatment group, 111 SAEs were reported in 81 (21.3%) patients. 
There were 69 TEAEs considered to be of special interest (hypertension, proteinuria) reported during 
the overall study period. In the SB8 treatment group, 39 TEAEs of special interest were reported in 31

The most frequently affected SOCs in both treatment groups were skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (48.7% in the SB8 and 48.2% in the EU Avastin treatment groups), blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (42.9% and 41.3%, respectively), and nervous system disorders (29.6% and 35.8%, 
respectively). 
Severe (Grade ≥ 3) TEAEs 
In the SB8 treatment group, 350 severe TEAEs in 174 (46.0%) patients were reported: 44 SAEs (33 
[8.7%] patients) of Grade 3, 19 SAEs (13 [3.4%] patients) of Grade 4, and 22 SAEs (22 [5.8%] 
patients) of Grade 5, respectively. 
In the Avastin treatment group, 336 severe TEAEs in 155 (40.8%) patients were reported: 42 SAEs 
(27 [7.1%] patients) of Grade 3, 26 SAEs (18 [4.7%] patients) of Grade 4, and 27 SAEs (27 [7.1%] 
patients) of Grade 5, respectively. 
The most frequently occurring severe TEAEs were neutropenia (8.7% in the SB8 and 9.5% in the 
Avastin treatment groups), hypertension (6.3% and 3.7%, respectively), anaemia (4.8% and 5.5%, 
respectively), and neutrophil count decreased (4.0% and 3.2% respectively). 
Relationship of TEAEs to Study Treatment 
In the SB8 treatment group, 628 TEAEs were reported to be related to the IP in 160 (42.3%) patients 
and in the Avastin treatment group, 651 TEAEs were reported to be related to the IP in 177 (46.6%)

At the SOC level, the most commonly reported TEAEs considered to be related to the IP were blood 
and lymphatic system disorders (14.8% in the SB8 and 11.6% in the Avastin treatment groups), 
investigations (13.8% and 14.7%, respectively), and gastrointestinal disorders (10.1% and 11.3%, 
respectively). 
In the SB8 treatment group, 1492 TEAEs were reported to be related to paclitaxel in 305 (80.7%)

•  Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Phase I Study SB8-G11-NHV 
AESI were not analysed.  
Phase III Study SB8-G31-NSCLC 
The following TEAEs were considered as adverse events of special interest.  
-  Hypertension: Hypertension NCI-CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥ 3 was classified as AESI.  
- 
Proteinuria:  If a patient was discovered to have ≥ 2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick (or other 
ways of urinalysis) and demonstrated 24 hours urine protein excretion ≥ 1 g or 
protein/creatinine ratio in spot urine ≥ 1g/g creatinine (or ≥ 226.0 mg/mmol creatinine), this 
was classified as AESI. 
Other AESIs reported for bevacizumab have not been listed. An ad-hoc analyses of AESIs by induction 
and maintenance period was provided. Among the AESIs (all Grades) occurring in ≥ 0.5% of patients, 
the overall AESIs showing ≥ 1% difference between treatments were ATE, hypertension, cardiac 
disorders (excluding CHF and ATE) (higher in the SB8 treatment group), and pulmonary haemorrhage, 
pulmonary hypertension and peripheral sensory neuropathy (higher in the EU Avastin treatment group) 
(data not shown). 
A total of 51 (6.7%) patients reported 69 TEAEs of special interest. In the SB8 treatment group, 39 
TEAEs of special interest were reported in 31 (8.2%) patients and in the Avastin treatment group, 30 
TEAEs of special interest were reported in 20 (5.3%) patients.

In the SB8 treatment group, 44 SAEs (33 [8.7%] patients) of grade 3, 19 SAEs (13 [3.4%] patients) 
of grade 4, and 22 SAEs (22 [5.8%] patients) of grade 5 were reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021

In the Avastin treatment group, 42 SAEs (27 [7.1%] patients) of grade 3, 26 SAEs (18 [4.7%] 
patients) of grade 4, and 27 SAEs (27 [7.1%] subjects) of grade 5 were reported. 
When a patient experienced more than 1 adverse events, the patient was only counted once for the 
maximum CTCAE grade. 
Relationship of SAEs to Study Treatment 
In the SB8 treatment group, 20 SAEs (16 [4.2%] patients) were considered to be related to IP, 28 
events (20 [5.3%] patients) were related to paclitaxel, and 27 events (20 [5.3%] patients) were 
related to carboplatin. 
In the Avastin treatment group, 27 SAEs (23 [6.1%] patients) were considered to be related to IP, 43 
events (33 [8.7%] patients) were related to paclitaxel and 39 events (29 [7.6%] patients) were 
related to carboplatin. 
Outcomes of SAEs/ Deaths 
Of the 215 SAEs reported, there were 49 fatal SAEs (22 patients in the SB8 treatment group and 27 
patients in the Avastin group. 
At the SOC level, the most commonly reported TEAEs leading to death were respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (1.3% in the SB8 and 2.9% in the Avastin treatment groups), general disorders 
and administration site conditions (1.3% and 1.6%, respectively), and nervous system disorders 
(0.8% and 1.1%, respectively). 
Summary of Deaths during the Study Period 
Overall, 44.5% (337/758) of the patients died (43.9%, 166/378 patients in the SB8 group; 45%, 
171/380 patients in the EU-Avastin group). The primary cause of death was the study indication 
(35.4% in the SB8 group; 35.5% in the EU-Avastin group), AEs (4.5% in the SB8 group; 6.1% in the 
EU-Avastin group) and other reasons (4% in the SB8 group; 3.4% in the EU-Avastin group). 
Laboratory findings 
Phase I Study SB8-G11-NHV 
Laboratory data (haematology, biochemistry, coagulation, urine analysis) did not show any significant 
changes over time which might be considered to be related to the IPs. In addition, no out-of-range 
vital sign values were identified by the Investigator as being clinically significant. 
Interpretation of the ECG recordings showed some abnormalities, but most of these abnormalities did 
not reach clinical relevance as judged by the Investigator. No abnormalities were found during the 
physical examinations by the Investigator. 
Phase III Study SB8-G31-NSCLC 
-  Clinical Laboratory evaluation 
o  Haematology: The most frequently reported significant abnormal (Grade ≥ 3) haematology 
parameters were neutrophils (up to 8.5% of patients in any cycle in the SB8 treatment group 
and 6.8% in the EU Avastin treatment group), lymphocytes (3.3% and 4.0%, respectively), 
leukocytes (2.2% and 3.0%, respectively), and haemoglobin (1.7% and 1.9%, respectively). 
o  Biochemistry: The most frequently reported significant abnormal (Grade ≥ 3) biochemistry 
parameters were sodium (up to 16.7% of patients in any cycle in the SB8 treatment group and 
1.9% in the EU Avastin treatment group), potassium (4.0% and 1.7%, respectively), bilirubin

(1.7% and 0.0%, respectively), AST (1.7% and 0.9%, respectively), ALT (1.0% and 4.0%, 
respectively), creatinine (1.0% and 0.4%, respectively).  
o  Coagulation, Urine Protein: there were no notable differences in the mean and median 
values of coagulation parameters and no notable differences in the urine parameters (dipstick 
results) observed between the SB8 and EU Avastin treatment groups. 
-  Vital Signs, 12-Lead Electrocardiogramm, Physical Examination Findings, other 
Observations: there was no evidence of clinically relevant differences in any parameter 
between the two treatment groups over time. There were no notable changes in the vital signs 
during the study, there were no notable shifts in 12-lead ECG parameters from baseline, there 
were also no notable changes in the physical examination findings during the study and no 
notable shifts in the ECOG performance status from the baseline. 
Safety in special populations 
Specific studies assessing the potential impact of safety in special groups of SB8, have not been 
conducted. 
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity assay validation 
For detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against SB8 and the reference product Avastin, the 
applicant proposed a 3-tiered single-assay approach including screening, confirmation, and 
neutralisation assays, as well as characterisation of potential neutralizing ADAs (ADA titer assay). 
Screening assay: 
Human serum ADA levels were analysed using methods validated with respect to sensitivity, 
specificity, intra- and inter-assay precision, and short-term stability. Assay selectivity was shown in the 
presence of haemolyzed and lipemic matrix components. Drug tolerance was established in the 
presence of varying concentrations of SB8. Assays were also successfully validated for prozone/hook 
effect. 
Neutralisation assay: 
Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in the clinical Phase I and Phase III study were determined using assays 
validated with regard to sensitivity, selectivity, short-term stability, inter- and intra-assay precision, 
drug tolerance and interference. No hook effect was observed.  
PK Study SB8-G11-NHV 
Blood samples of all 119 randomised patients (40 subjects in SB8, 40 subjects in EU Avastin 
and 39 subjects in US Avastin treatment groups) were collected on Day 1 (pre-dose), Day 22, 
Day 57, and Day 85 (single dose of SB8, EU Avastin or US Avastin) for determination of ADA 
to bevacizumab and NAbs. 
In the SAF, the post-dose incidence of the subjects with ADAs to bevacizumab was reported as 
1 (2.6%), 4 (10.3%), and 1 (2.6%) in the SB8, EU Avastin, and US Avastin treatment groups, 
respectively. The overall incidence of the subjects with ADA to bevacizumab was comparable 
among the three treatment groups. No subject in any treatment group was positive for NAbs.

Study SB8-G31-NSCLC 
The SAF comprised of 758 patients: 378 patients in the SB8 treatment group and 380 patients 
in the EU Avastin treatment group. Blood samples were collected at pre-dose of Cycle 1, 3, 5, 
7 and the End of Treatment (EOT) visit (at least 21 days after the last dose of IP 
administration and prior to initiation of subsequent therapy for NSCLC). 
Overall ADA results (up to the relevant time point) were determined as positive for a subject 
with a negative ADA at pre-dose Cycle 1 who had at least one positive result after pre-dose of 
Cycle 1, and for subjects with a positive ADA at pre-dose Cycle 1, who had at least one 
positive result with higher titre level compared with baseline (i.e., treatment-boosted ADA).

ADA formation was similar at each time point, being 13.5% vs. 10.1% with SB8 and EU Avastin, 
respectively by cycle 7. At EOT the difference was more pronounced: 14% of patients were tested ADA 
positive with SB8 compared to 5.6% with EU sourced Avastin, with statistically significant association 
between treatments and the ADA status at EOT (p=0.0121).   
Overall 16.1% vs. 11.0 % of subjects with SB8 and EU Avastin, respectively, had ADA formation up to 
EOT. A respectable proportion of ADA positive patients also tested positive for neutralizing antibodies 
(up to 42.9% of ADA pos. patients with SB8 compared to 55.6% of ADA pos. patients with EU Avastin 
at EOT). Distribution of high and low titres were comparable at each cycle except for EOT, where one 
patient each had a titre of 128, 256, 512 with SB8 compared to none with EU Avastin.

Impact of ADAs on pharmacokinetics: 
In the pivotal Phase I PK study SB8-G11-NSCLC, the overall incidence of ADA was comparable between 
the SB8 and EU Avastin treatment groups. One subject (2.6%) in the SB8 group and 4 subjects 
(10.3%) in the EU-Avastin group exhibited post-dose ADA positive results. None of the subjects 
developed NAbs after administration of SB8 or EU-Avastin.  
In the PK substudy of the Phase III trial SB8-G31-NSCLC, it was noticed, that the mean Ctrough and Cmax 
values were constantly lower for SB8 compared to EU Avastin. This difference was further confirmed in 
the subgroups of ADA positive and ADA negative patients.

The number of patients with an overall ADA-positive result up to Cycle 7 was 24 (16.1%) patients in 
the SB8 treatment group and 17 (10.6%) patients in the EU Avastin treatment group. The number of 
patients with an overall ADA-positive result up to EOT was 28 (18.8%) patients in the SB8 treatment 
group and 18 (11.2%) patients in the EU Avastin treatment group. There was no statistically significant 
difference (p-value > 0.05) for ADA formation at each cycle, but the study was not powered to detect 
any differences. The incidence of ADA formation in the PK subgroup with SB8 was higher at all cycles 
(1,3,5,7) and at EOT, but the percentage differences were generally low with highest difference at EOT 
with 5.3%. For cycles 1-7, the highest percentage difference in ADA formation was at cycle 3 with 
3.5%. 
Summary statistics of PK parameters (Ctrough and Cmax) by overall ADA results up to Cycle 7 for the PK 
population were provided. In the Avastin treatment group, the mean Ctrough at all cycles in the ADA-
positive subgroup was lower than the corresponding values in the ADA-negative subgroup, whereas 
the mean Ctrough of SB8 were sometimes higher or lower in the ADA-positive subgroup compared to the 
ADA-negative subgroup. Mean Cmax of both SB8 and Avastin at all cycles in the ADA-positive subgroup 
was higher than in the ADA-negative subgroup.  
Taken together, the percentage of ADA-positive patients per cycle in the PK population are overall 
comparable between the SB8 and EU Avastin treatment groups and the influence on PK values is 
considered minimal. The difference in mean PK outcomes does not seem to be associated with the 
difference in ADA formation, i.e. higher differences in the number of ADA positive patients does not 
lead to higher differences in mean concentration outcomes between treatment groups comparing all 
cycles (comparing Table 11 to Table 63). 
Impact of ADAs on efficacy:  
Best ORR was separately presented for ADA positive and ADA negative patients. Slightly more 
responders in the SB8 treatment arm were ADA positive by cycle 7: 13.5% vs 10.1% subjects with 
SB8 and Avastin, respectively. The influence of ADA formation on ORR was quite different: whereas 
with SB8 best ORR rate was lower in ADA positive patients compared to ADA negative patients, 
response incidence was higher in the ADA positive patients compared to ADA negative patients in the 
Avastin treatment arm. The difference [95% CI] in best ORR among subjects with an overall negative 
ADA result was 6.9% [-1.6%, 15.5%] and in positive ADA result -9.3% [-31.6%, 13.0%] for the PPS, 
with the lower bound of the CI lying much below the non-inferiority margin. A direct comparison to the 
primary analysis is not possible, as efficacy outcomes for ADA were presented by cycle 7 compared to 
best ORR by w24 for the primary endpoint.  
Additional analyses of ORR by w24 with imputation of values for patients who discontinue the study 
were also presented.

Table 65: Overall response rate at each cycle by overall ADA status up to cycle 7 during the induction 
period (Per-protocol set, study SB8-G31-NSCLC) (Ad-hoc analysis) 
The response was higher in ADA positive patients compared to ADA negative patients in the Avastin 
treatment arm. In contrast, response was lower in ADA positive patients compared to ADA negative 
patients with SB8. Comparison of PFS and DOR shows no relevant effect of ADA development on these 
efficacy endpoints in both treatment groups. 
The applicant further investigated influencing factors on ORR by ADA subgroup, as baseline or disease 
characteristics. Some unfavourable prognostic factors (e.g. higher proportion of patients in age ≥ 65 
years and ≥ 70 years, males, non-Asian, cancer type of other than adenocarcinoma, ECOG PS of 1 
rather than 0, and formal and current smoker) were detected in the ADA positive patients treated with 
SB8 compared to Avastin.  
Impact of ADAs on safety:  
Subgroup safety analysis by overall ADA results up to EOT was performed on the SAF. Overall, in ADA 
positive patients, more patients experienced TEAEs with SB8 compared to EU Avastin:  53 vs. 35 
patients until EOT, respectively. A total of 4126 TEAEs were reported for 519 patients (252 in the SB8 
Assessment report

and 267 in the EU Avastin treatment groups) with an overall negative ADA result until EOT. The most 
commonly reported TEAEs at the system organ class (SOC) level was skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders in both ADA positive and ADA negative subgroups.  
As a follow-up, the applicant investigated the ADA status at the time of start date of TEAEs among 
overall ADA-positive patients who discontinued the study due to TEAEs in both treatment groups along 
with the assessments for IP and non-IP relatedness and the severity of TEAEs to explore the 
association of TEAEs and ADA results. There was a numerically higher incidence of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation in patients with overall ADAs up to EOT in the SB8 treatment group. When considering 
the causal relationship of the TEAEs with immunogenicity, only 2 events (one patient with anaphylaxis 
reaction and one with hypersensitivity) appeared to be related to immunogenicity.  
ADAs at EOT represents the incidence of ADA positive results at EOT timepoint without consideration of 
‘treatment induced ADA’ or ‘treatment-boosted ADA’, ‘transient’ and ‘inconclusive’. Twenty-one (14%) 
patients in the SB8 and 9 (5.6%) patients in the EU Avastin group had ADAs at EOT and 55 (16.1%) 
patients in the SB8 and 37 (11%) patients in the EU Avastin group had overall ADAs up to EOT. 
Twenty-eight (7.4%) patients in the SB8 and 26 (6.8%) patients in the EU Avastin group had nAbs at 
EOT and 26 (6.9%) patients in the SB8 and 23 (6.1%) patients in the EU Avastin group had nAbs up to 
EOT. Up to Cycle 7, 19 (5%) patients in the SB8 and 20 (5.3%) patients in the EU Avastin group had 
nAbs.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The applicant has provided safety data from Phase I single-dose PK clinical trial in healthy male 
volunteers (Study SB8-G11-NHV), and one Phase III clinical trial in adult NSCLC patients (Study SB8-
G31-NSCLC).  
In the pivotal PK study, the safety population consisted of 119 healthy male subjects aged 18 to 59 
years who were randomised to one of three treatment arms and exposed to a single dose of 3mg/kg 
bevacizumab i.v. (SB8: 40 subjects; EU sourced Avastin: 40 subjects; US sourced Avastin: 39 
subjects). In the Phase III trial, the safety population consisted of all NSCLC patients who received 
bevacizumab (either SB8 or EU Avastin) at a dose of 15 mg/kg i.v. at least once. Hence, a total of 758 
out of the 763 randomised patients were included in the SAF (SB8 group: 378 patients [99.7%]; EU 
Avastin group: 380 patients [99%]). The overall safety population is considered sufficient to capture 
relevant safety signals in this comparability exercise. 
In the efficacy study, NSCLC patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an IV dose of 15 
mg/kg of SB8 or EU Avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (every three weeks) for at least 4 and no 
more than 6 cycles (induction treatment phase). Patients who responded to treatment continued with 
bevacizumab as monotherapy in the maintenance treatment phase until evidence of disease 
progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, death, or 12 months from the randomisation of the last 
patient (End of Study [EOS]), whichever occurred first.  
Due to the heterogeneity of the study populations and the different treatment schemes used in both 
studies, no pooled safety analysis of the two clinical trials was applicable.  
A similar extent of exposure was observed between the two treatment arms in the efficacy study with 
regard to the mean cumulative actual doses during the induction and maintenance treatment period, 
the mean duration of exposure (SB8 34.26 weeks, range: 3 to 105.4 weeks; EU-Avastin 35.26 weeks, 
range: 3 to 101.3 weeks) and mean number of cycles received (4.8 cycles in both treatment groups 
during the induction treatment; 9.3 cycles in the SB8 group and 9.1 cycles in the EU-Avastin group 
during the maintenance treatment period). The number of patients who received bevacizumab 
decreased constantly throughout the study duration and to a similar extent in both groups.  
The overall extent of exposure to paclitaxel and carboplatin was also similar between the two groups 
and dose reduction of paclitaxel and carboplatin due to mainly AEs, were necessary in a similar 
proportion of patients in both groups.  
The proportion of patients who experienced at least one dose delay of bevacizumab during the 
induction or maintenance treatment phase was comparable between both treatment groups. The main 
reasons were AEs (17.5% in the SB8 group and 14.5% in the EU Avastin group). Upon request, the 
applicant provided data in relation to dose delay of bevacizumab during the induction or maintenance 
treatment phase. The difference in dose delay due to adverse events in the maintenance phase was 
minimal, whereas in the induction phase 66 patients had 100 AEs leading to dose delay in the SB8 
group compared to 55 patients and 87 events in the Avastin group. The differences were mainly 
observed in Blood and lymphatic system disorders and other laboratory blood parameters (SOC 
“Investigations”).  Haematologic TEAE leading to dose delays were further investigated by SOC, PT and 
CTCAE grade in induction period for patients with at least one dose delay. Beside a difference in 
`anaemia’ (8 [2.1%] patients in the SB8 treatment group and 3 [0.8%] patients in the EU Avastin 
Assessment report

treatment group) there was no specific trend in other events indicating more events in the SB8 
treatment group in comparison to Avastin treatment group (Data not shown). 
The number of patients that completed the induction treatment period was comparable between the 
SB8 and EU Avastin treatment groups (68.1% in the SB8 treatment group and 72.1% in the Avastin 
treatment group). A similar proportion of patients discontinued during the maintenance treatment 
period in both groups (58.8% in the SB8 group; 62.2% in the EU Avastin group). The main reasons for 
discontinuation in the induction and maintenance treatment period in both groups were disease 
progression, AEs or death in both groups. Thus, at the time of EOS, the proportion of subjects who 
were ongoing in the maintenance treatment period was very low in both groups, 9.2% in the SB8 
treatment group and 9.9% in the EU Avastin treatment group, respectively.  
In the pivotal PK trial (Study SB8-G11-NHV) the proportion of subjects who experienced a TEAE was 
lower in the EU Avastin group (37.5%) as compared to the SB8 (50%) and US-Avastin group (53.8%) 
groups. All of the TEAEs were however, grade 1 (mild) in severity, with the exception of one TEAE 
being grade 3 in the SB8 group (a severe perirectal abscess, considered to be serious) and one TEAE 
being grade 3 in the US-Avastin group (severe syncope; not considered to be serious). The applicant 
considered the two TEAEs to be unlikely related to the IP based on the late onset of the AEs (53 days 
and 71 days, respectively). In the case of the perirectal access, this argumentation cannot be followed, 
since an abscess does not originate spontaneously. The applicant further stated that upon 
retrospective review of all cases grouped under the same primary SOCs as those two events, no 
particular safety risk was identified. This is acknowledged but it should be noted that the sample size 
(N=119) is too small to draw firm conclusions on differences in these AEs based on the results 
obtained in Study SB8-G11-NHV. No TEAES of Grade 4 (life threatening) or 5 (death) in severity and 
no discontinuations due to TEAEs or other safety issues occurred during the study in any of the groups. 
No infusion related reactions were reported in this study. 
The most frequently affected SOCs among the treatment groups in Study SB8-G11-NHV were 
infections and infestations and gastrointestinal disorders. A higher incidence of gastro-intestinal 
disorders was noticed however, in the SB8 group (22.5%) when compared with the EU- (5.0%) or US-
Avastin groups (5.1%). According to the applicant, only 1 of the 16 TEAEs in SOC “GI disorders” was 
assessed as “related to IP”. The number of subjects experiencing TEAEs related to IP was similarly low 
between the three treatment groups. 
In the efficacy trial (Study SB8-G31-NSCLC), the majority of patients (91.6%) experienced at least one 
causality TEAE (92.1% in the SB8 group; 91.1% in the EU Avastin group), most of the TEAEs being 
grade 1 and grade 2 in severity in both treatment groups. In general, across both treatment arms, the 
incidence, type and severity of TEAEs seem similar and the distribution is in line with the safety profile 
for bevacizumab (SmPC Avastin). No new safety signals were identified during the induction period, 70 
IP-related Grade 3 TEAEs occurred in 32 (8.5%) patients in the SB8 treatment group and 44 events 
occurred in 20 (5.3%) patients in the EU Avastin treatment group. Thus, the majority of TEAEs causing 
the imbalance in the incidence rate of Grade 3 TEAEs occurred during the induction period where the IP 
was administered concurrently with chemotherapy. Although this kind of TEAEs is also known for the 
chemotherapy, this does not explain the imbalance between the two groups. All in all, the numbers of 
patients and events of leukopenia in the induction period were consistently higher in the SB8 group 
compared to the Avastin group. The applicant clarified that the difference of events reported by PT 
‘leukopenia’ between treatment groups during the induction treatment period was due to a higher 
incidence of Grade 1 leukopenia in the SB8 treatment group (18 (4.8%) patients with 23 events in the 
SB8 group versus 8 (2.1%) patients with 9 events in the EU Avastin  group). The numerically higher 
incidence of Grade 1 ‘leukopenia’ is considered clinically negligible based on similar characteristics of 
reported events between the treatment groups and on the comparable results between the SB8 and EU

Avastin treatment groups obtained from an extended analysis of related PTs grouped under the AESI of 
neutropenia. 
Among the AESIs (all Grades) occurring in ≥ 0.5% of patients, the overall AESIs showing ≥ 1% 
difference between treatments were ATE, hypertension, cardiac disorders (excluding CHF and ATE) 
(higher in the SB8 treatment group), and pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary hypertension and 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (higher in the EU Avastin treatment group). The absolute incidence of 
all these events in both treatment groups were within the expected range of the incidence of similar 
events previously described for bevacizumab.   
The reported TEAEs for hypertension and proteinuria grade ≥ 3 were found to be within the expected 
incidences for the reference product Avastin (see Avastin EPAR) and considered comparable between 
the two treatment arms. It is noticed however, that a slightly higher number of patients exhibited 
“hypertension grade ≥ 3” in the SB8 group (7.7% of the patients; EU Avastin: 4.2%). An ad-hoc 
analysis of the number and proportion of patients who experienced hypertension (PT) with Grade ≥ 3 
using the Wald’s method resulted in a difference of 2.66% [95% CI: -0.44%, 5.77%]. Thus, there was 
no statistical difference in the incidence of hypertension (PT) Grade ≥ 3. Furthermore, an ad-hoc 
analysis for the AESI hypertension based only on the blood pressure measurements demonstrated 
comparable results between the SB8 and Avastin treatment groups. It was concluded that based on 
the comparable incidence of hypertension by objective blood pressure assessment results, the 
numerical difference in the incidence of hypertension Grade ≥ 3 is deemed clinically negligible. No 
grade 4 hypertension or proteinuria have been reported in any of the groups (data not shown).  
Infusion-related reactions were observed in a slightly higher number of patients of the SB8 group 
(20/378 patients; 5.3%) compared to the EU Avastin group (11/380 patients; 2.9%). It is further 
noted, that in the SB8 group slightly more patients exhibited hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions 
after infusions of bevacizumab than in the EU Avastin group and up to a higher number of cycles for 
each IP and Non-IP. In addition, four patients in the SB8 group (none in the EU Avastin group) 
experienced immune system disorders leading to IP discontinuation.  
The applicant provided further data on the incidences in hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions 
observed in study SB8-G31-NSCLC (data not shown). Overall, these data seem comparable to 
historical data with the reference product as described in the Avastin SmPC. 
The incidence and type of the SAEs reported in the efficacy study SB8-G31-NSCLC were in line with the 
known safety profile of bevacizumab and generally comparable between the groups and no clinically 
meaningful differences were noted. Altogether, 20.6% of the patients experienced SAEs, all of which 
were treatment-emergent (i.e. serious TEAEs). A summary of the outcomes and further action taken in 
patients experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs) in the Safety Set (SAF) in the clinical Phase III 
study (SB8-G31-NSCLC) together with a summary of SAEs separately for the induction treatment 
period and maintenance treatment period were provided (data not shown).. All SAEs including serious 
TEAEs, serious TEAEs leading to IP/non-IP discontinuation and death were comparable between 
treatments during induction and maintenance treatment period. 
SAEs leading to death occurred in a total of 49 patients: in 22 patients (5.8%) of the SB8 group, and 
in 27 (7.1%) patients of the EU Avastin group. The most commonly reported TEAEs leading to death 
were similar between both groups including respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1.3% in 
the SB8 and 2.9% in the Avastin treatment groups), general disorders and administration site 
conditions (1.3% and 1.6%, respectively), and nervous system disorders (0.8% and 1.1%, 
respectively). There were two patients who died due to cerebrovascular accidents (strokes), one in 
each treatment group for which detailed case reports were provided. According to these narratives, 
there were no autopsy nor CNS imaging (CT or MRI) performed in any case. Causal relationship 
between the fatal cerebrovascular accident AE and the IP (SB8) treatment could not be ruled out,

according to the applicant; whereas, relationship between the fatal cerebrovascular AE and the IP 
(Avastin) treatment could not be determined due to the too many confounding factors, including the 
patient's underlying ankylosing spondylitis (AS), which might result in an elevated risk for 
haemorrhagic stroke compared to non-AS patients. 
A tabulated overview of fatal AEs of haemorrhagic origin for both treatment groups (SB8 and Avastin) 
showed that the number and incidence of fatal haemorrhage AEs associated with SB8 was comparable 
to and numerically lower than that of EU Avastin (data not shown). 
There was no evidence of clinically relevant differences in any laboratory parameter between the three 
treatment groups over time in the pivotal PK study and between the two treatment arms in the efficacy 
study. The laboratory findings along with shifts from normal values for both clinical studies were 
presented and did not show clinically relevant differences between the treatment groups. 
Based on the validation of the assay, the biosimilar drug product and reference product appear similar 
and the validated single-assay approach can be utilised for the measurement of both anti-SB8 and 
anti-Avastin antibodies. Antigenic equivalence could be shown for the nAb assay validated for the 
Phase III study in NSCLC patients justifying the use of the single-assay approach applied by the 
applicant. The specification criteria set in the validation protocol were met for both of the applied nAb 
assays. 
The evaluation of immunogenicity in the pivotal PK study in healthy volunteers, revealed only one 
patient positive for ADA development with SB8, with occurrence at d85 (EOS). No subject was tested 
ADA positive at baseline. Also with EU sourced and US sourced Avastin, ADA formation was very low 
and transient. No subject developed NAbs and results are considered comparable. In the efficacy trial, 
antidrug antibodies against bevacizumab seem to be transient.  Pre-existing antibody was shown in 30 
out of 741 treatment-naïve pre-dose samples (4.0%). Literature on the overall prevalence of pre-
existing antibodies by assay also suggests a rate of 4.2% in disease population (Xue L and Rup B, 
2013). ADA formation was similar at each time point, being 13.5% vs. 10.1% with SB8 and EU Avastin 
by cycle 7, respectively. At EOT the difference was more pronounced: 14% of patients were tested 
ADA positive with SB8 compared to 5.6% with EU sourced Avastin, with statistically significant 
association between treatments and the ADA status at EOT (p=0.0121). Overall, in ADA positive 
patients, numerically more subject experienced TEAEs with SB8 compared to EU Avastin:  53 vs. 35 
subjects, respectively. The applicant investigated the ADA status at the time of start date of TEAEs 
among overall ADA-positive patients who discontinued the study due to TEAEs in both treatment 
groups along with the assessments for IP and non-IP relatedness and the severity of TEAEs to explore 
the association of TEAEs and ADA results. There was a numerically higher incidence of TEAEs leading 
to discontinuation in patients with overall ADAs up to EOT in the SB8 treatment group. When 
considering the causal relationship of the TEAEs with immunogenicity, only 2 events (one patient with 
anaphylaxis reaction and one with hypersensitivity) appeared to be related to immunogenicity. This is 
not considered to affect the comparability of the two IPs. 
Overall 16.1% vs. 11.0 % of subjects with SB8 and EU Avastin, respectively, had ADA formation up to 
EOT.  The higher difference in overall ADA results is due to more different patients per cycle being 
affected in the SB8 compared to the EU Avastin group. For ADA formation at EOT it has to be 
considered that this happened at different time points for each patient. A significant proportion of ADA 
positive patients also tested positive for neutralizing antibodies (up to 42.9% of ADA positive patients 
with SB8 compared to 55.6% of ADA positive patients with EU Avastin at EOT). Distribution of high and 
low titres were comparable at each cycle except for EOT, where one patient had a titre of 128, 256, 
512 with SB8 compared to none with EU Avastin. No difference in the rates of nAbs could be observed 
between the SB8 and the Avastin treatment group. Up to Cycle 7, 19 (5%) patients in the SB8 and 20 
(5.3.%) patients in the EU Avastin group had nAbs. Twenty eight (7.4%) patients in the SB8 and 26 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 108/120 
 
 
 
(6.8%) patients in the EU Avastin group had nAbs at EOT and 26 (6.9%) patients in the SB8 and 23 
(6.1%) patients in the EU Avastin group had nAbs up to EOT. For the PK subpopulation, no remarkable 
difference could be seen between treatments in the proportion of ADA-positive patients with higher 
titre (≥64) which was generally quite low. The distribution of ADA titers are comparable between the 
two treatment groups for each cycle and higher titer levels are not generally observed for one of the 
treatments. 
Although the applicant’s line of arguments to compare the overall ADA incidences up to EOT between 
the two treatment groups, which are ‘treatment-induced’ and ‘treatment-boosted ADAs’ up to EOT, can 
be followed, the number of ADAs at EOT was higher in the SB8 group. The number of patients who 
discontinued due to progressive disease (PD), adverse events (AE) and death between the two 
treatment groups among the patients by overall ADA status up to EOT was investigated to discuss 
clinical relevance of differences in ADAs and nAbs between the treatment groups. Only the rate of AEs 
was higher in the SB8 treatment group, but this does not influence comparability between the 
treatment groups. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The incidence, type and severity of TEAEs of the data presented are comparable between SB8 and EU 
Avastin and are in line with the safety profile for bevacizumab (SmPC Avastin). No new safety signals 
were identified and the immunogenicity results do not indicate relevant differences to the reference 
product. Nevertheless, the presence of C-terminal AA sequence variants at low levels in the batches 
used in the clinical studies, were scrutinised in terms of potential effects on the safety profile of SB8. 
In addition to safety and immunogenicity data from both clinical Phase I (SB8-G11-NHV) and Phase III 
(SB8-G31- NSCLC) studies, the C-terminal amino acid (AA) sequence variants of SB8 from structural 
aspect were discussed and its potential risk of immunogenicity was presented. An impact on 
immunogenicity and potential related consequences are clinically negligible as the sequence variants 
are unlikely to activate immunogenicity.

At quality level, a comprehensive and well-established biosimilarity exercise, which is in line with the 
relevant EMA guidelines has been conducted.  
An extensive characterisation of the EU-sourced reference medicinal product Avastin including a total 
of up to 46 EU-sourced lots of Avastin has been provided. The subsequent side-by-side comparison 
included pilot, clinical and process performance qualification active substance batches as well as clinical 
and process performance qualification batches of the DP (for both presentations) and a subset of lots 
of Avastin.  
A broad panel of standard and state-of-the-art methods covering relevant physicochemical as well as 
biological quality attributes has been used. In particular, the quantity, the primary structure, purity 
and impurities, charged variants, hydrophobic variants, carbohydrate structure, and higher order 
structure have been addressed. Regarding the biological characteristics, cell-based potency assays, 
binding assays, Fc related activities, and additional assays for further characterisation have been used. 
In summary, the used panel of methods for characterisation and comparison of SB8 with its reference 
medicinal product is considered sufficient and no additional tests have been requested. 
In terms of non-clinical aspects, two in vivo xenograft mouse studies were provided: biosimilarity 
between SB8 and EU Avastin was studied in a non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model (Study No. 
E0303-U1501), and between SB8 and US Avastin in a colorectal carcinoma xenograft model (Study No. 
E0303-U1502). Additionally, biosimilarity between SB8 and US Avastin was studied in 4 weeks 
repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (Study No. 000080642).  
In general, the clinical development program followed EMA guidelines and prior CHMP advice, and 
consisted of  
- 
- 
a pivotal three-arm PK study (SB8-G11-NHV), comparing SB8 to EU-sourced and US-sourced 
Avastin in 119 healthy male subjects, investigating PK, safety and immunogenicity 
a multi-centre parallel group efficacy/safety study (>12 months) (SB8-G31-NSCLC) in 763 patients 
with metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC to comparatively investigate efficacy, safety, 
immunogenicity and PK (in a subset of patients). 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality results 
A comprehensive and robust biosimilarity exercise demonstrates similarity of the biosimilar candidate 
with its reference medicinal product. In particular, the various assays addressing the biological 
functions of bevacizumab showed a highly similar profile of SB8 with its reference medicinal product. 
At the physicochemical level, some differences have been observed. These differences have been 
sufficiently justified to have no impact on the clinical performance of Onbevzi and its biosimilarity to 
the reference medicinal product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 112/120 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-clinical results 
Non-clinical studies supported biosimilarity between SB8 and Avastin. The biological functions of SB8 
and EU-sourced Avastin assessed in vitro, i.e. VEGF-A binding, VEGF-A neutralisation, inhibition of 
HUVEC proliferation and migration as well as Fc-related activities, have been demonstrated to be 
similar. The anti-tumour activity of SB8 and EU Avastin was generally comparable in the non-small cell 
lung cancer mouse xenograft model (Study No. E0303-U1501), and the toxicological and toxicokinetic 
profile of SB8 and US Avastin was similar in the 4 weeks repeated dose toxicity study (Study No. 
000080642). 
Clinical results 
Pharmacokinetics: In the pivotal PK study SB8-G11-NHV, the primary PK analysis demonstrated PK 
comparability of SB8 with its reference product EU-Avastin as the 90% confidence intervals for the 
ratios of the primary (AUC0-inf) and key secondary parameters (AUClast, Cmax) were well contained 
within the standard bioequivalence interval of 0.80–1.25. The geometric LSMean ratios (90% CI) for 
SB8 and EU Avastin in AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax were 0.880 (0.8154 to 0.9498), 0.886 (0.8258 to 
0.9516) and 0.996 (0.9333 to 1.0628), respectively. Similar results were obtained when comparing 
SB8 and US-Avastin. 
The secondary parameters (Tmax, Vz, t1/2, CL) were also found to be generally comparable between SB8 
and EU/US-Avastin, indicating however a higher clearance and thus a lower bioavailability of SB8 
compared to its reference products (see Section 3.3 below).  
PK was further evaluated in a subset of 341/763 patients in the clinical Phase III Study SB8-G31-
NSCLC comparing SB8 (161 patients; 42.5%)) with EU-Avastin (180 patients; 46.9%). The Ctrough and 
Cmax levels of SB8 and EU-Avastin (measured at cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7) were considered largely 
comparable between both treatment groups. The Ctrough and Cmax values appear to increase steadily in 
both treatment groups, converging to a steady state at Cycle 3.  
Efficacy:  
The primary endpoint best ORR by w24 indicated a difference in the PPS of 5.3%, [95% CI: -2.2%, 
12.9%], with the upper limit of the 95% CI slightly exceeding the pre-defined comparability margin of 
[-12.5%, 12.5%]. In the sensitivity analysis performed with the FAS, the difference was 4.8%, the 
95% CI being within the comparability margin. The risk ratio of best ORR including 90% CI was also 
within the predefined comparability margin of [0.737, 1.357] in both, the FAS and PPS. 
The secondary endpoints and further analyses are largely in support of biosimilarity. The median PFS 
was 8.5 months [95% CI: 7.20, 9.70] vs. 7.9 months [95% CI: 7.30, 9.40] for SB8 and Avastin, 
respectively, with a HR of 1.02. The median OS was 14.80 [95% CI: 13.00, 17.00] vs. 15.80 [95% CI: 
13.80, 17.70] for SB8 and Avastin, respectively and a HR of 1.08. The PFS and OS rates of 6-month, 
12 month (and 18 month in case of OS) were comparable. The difference in DOR was 0.48 months in 
favour of EU Avastin.  
Best ORR by w11 and w17 were similar, the 95% CI of the difference being within a ±12.5% margin.  
Further post hoc analyses were presented due to the observed difference in the primary endpoint:  
-  ORR at cycle 2 and cycle 4 were comparable. Analyses of PFS and OS using a Cox regression 
model showed similar results as the initial analysis, in support of biosimilarity. In addition, the 
maximum change in tumour burden from baseline was investigated post-hoc, showing similar 
results between treatments: The mean of the maximum percentage change from baseline in 
tumour burden by 24 weeks of chemotherapy was −27.8% for SB8 and −27.3% for EU-
sourced Avastin. The difference between the two treatment groups was 0.6% [95% CI of 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 113/120 
 
 
 
−4.18%, 2.99%]. Results were comparable by w11 and w17 with a difference of 0.5% and 
0.7%, respectively. The ad-hoc sensitivity analysis of the difference in best ORR adjusted by 
the subcategory of distant metastasis showed an adjusted difference of 4.7%, with the two-
sided 95%CI of [−2.9%, 12.2%], which was entirely contained within the pre-defined 
equivalence margin of [−12.5%, 12.5%]. 
- 
The requested MMRM analysis of the difference in change from baseline in tumour burden 
showed no significant difference (sum of the diameters of the target lesions) during the 
induction period, even with negative point estimate. 
- 
In the forest plot of demographic subgroup analyses for best ORR at cycle 6 the point 
estimates for the difference in best ORR during induction period lie within the equivalence 
margins (except for the Russian subgroup, which is very likely a chance finding beside very 
slight differences between prognostic baseline characteristics), but mostly show a higher 
efficacy of SB8 compared to Avastin.  
- 
The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve of the time to study discontinuation for all randomised patients 
were comparable.  
-  A more conservative imputation method including all patients without tumour assessment was 
presented upon request for the primary endpoint best ORR by w24 of the induction period, for 
ORR at cycle 6 of the induction period, and multiple other analyses. As the difference of ORR 
still very slightly crossed the upper bound of the predefined comparability range, these results 
are discussed in the uncertainties section. In order to classify the clinical relevance of this 
slight difference, a WLS regression analysis based on the dataset of 6 observations (four 
historical studies with Avastin and Study SB8-G31-NSCLC) was performed: a best ORR 
difference of 12.5% vs. 13% would correspond to 2.47-month and 2.63-month PFS, 
respectively. The 95% bootstrap CI for the difference in median PFS between the SB8 and EU 
Avastin treatment groups was calculated as [−1.5, 2.0] months.Further supportive in terms of 
biosimilarity is the analysis for the difference in ORR at Cycle 6 regardless of study period, 
which can be interpreted as a treatment policy estimand and better reflect the outcome in 
clinical practice after 6 cycles. The difference in ORR at Cycle 6 regardless of study period 
resulted in 4.8% [95% CI: –2.8%, 12.3%] for the PPS and in 4.9% [95% CI: –2.0%, 11.9%] 
for the FAS, which was entirely within a comparability range of ±12.5%.The analyses for ORR 
at cycle 2 and 4 with data imputed for patients without tumour assessment showed only slight 
difference in ORR, which is similar to the initially presented results. 
Safety: 
In healthy volunteers in the pivotal PK study SB8-G11-NHV no TEAES of Grade 4 (life threatening) or 5 
(death) in severity and no discontinuations due to TEAEs or other safety issues occurred during the 
study in any of the groups. No infusion related reactions were reported in this study.  
In patients the overall extent of exposure to IP and Non-IP seemed to be comparable between both 
treatment groups, nevertheless further analyses are requested as potential differences are considered 
to impact efficacy outcome. The incidences, types and severities of TEAEs and SAEs seem also 
comparable between SB8 and EU Avastin and are in line with the safety profile for bevacizumab (SmPC 
Avastin). No new safety signals were identified. 
SAEs leading to death occurred in a comparable number of patients in both groups: in 22 patients 
(5.8%) of the SB8 group, and in 27 (7.1%) patients of the EU Avastin group. The most commonly 
reported TEAEs leading to death were similar between both groups and were respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (1.3% in the SB8 and 2.9% in the Avastin treatment groups), general disorders 
Assessment report  
EMA/117409/2021  
Page 114/120 
 
 
 
and administration site conditions (1.3% and 1.6%, respectively), and nervous system disorders 
(0.8% and 1.1%, respectively). 
The number of patients completing the induction treatment period was comparable between the SB8 
and EU Avastin treatment group (68.1% in the SB8 treatment group and 72.1% in the Avastin 
treatment group). A similar amount of patients discontinued during the maintenance treatment period 
in both groups (58.8% in the SB8 group; 62.2% in the EU Avastin group). The main reasons for 
discontinuation in the induction and maintenance treatment period in both groups were disease 
progression, AEs or death in both groups. Thus, at the time of EOS the proportion of subjects who 
were ongoing in the maintenance treatment period was very low and similar in both groups, 9.2% in 
the SB8 treatment group and 9.9% in the EU Avastin treatment group, respectively. 
Immunogenicity was comparable in healthy volunteers. In the efficacy/safety study, ADA formation by 
cycle 7 was 13.5% vs. 10.1% with SB8 and EU Avastin, respectively. The distribution of high and low 
titres was comparable at each cycle except for EOT, where one patient each had a titre of 128, 256, 
512 with SB8 compared to none with EU Avastin. A respectable proportion of ADA positive patients 
also tested positive for neutralizing antibodies (up to 42.9% of ADA positive patients with SB8 
compared to 55.6 with EU Avastin at EOT). Any potential impact of ADAs on PK, efficacy and safety 
was thoroughly investigated and found not to be clinically relevant. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality uncertainties and limitations: 
The presence of additional C- and N-terminal sequence variants at low levels, observed in SB8 but not 
in EU Avastin, was a matter of discussion during the procedure. The question emerged whether 
biosimilarity between two recombinant proteins, in this case between two IgG monoclonal antibodies, 
can be considered demonstrated despite certain differences in the amino acid sequence, since the 
concept of biosimilarity of recombinant proteins requires sequence identity. However, it should be 
highlighted that these sequence variants are extensions at the ends of the amino acid chain, and not 
amino acid insertions within the protein. The above-mentioned identity refers to the main component 
of the active substances and minor variants are conceived as product-related substances. The heavy 
chain C-terminal lysine heterogeneity is well known, and additional N-terminal residues from the signal 
peptides are not uncommon either. In summary, these sequence variants are considered as product-
related impurities which need to be strictly controlled by an appropriate control system.  
Since a potential impact of these sequence variants on safety/immunogenicity – although not observed 
in the clinical efficacy and safety comparability study – could not be completely ruled out, the applicant 
strengthened the control strategy initially proposed. In addition,  the applicant is recommended to a) 
consider a further tightening of the limit when a number of batch results sufficient for statistical 
analysis is available, and b) to implement a more direct control dedicated to control C-terminal 
sequence variants present in Onbevzi post-marketing. 
Clinical Uncertainties and limitations: 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Even though in the pivotal PK study, the primary endpoint (AUCinf) and the main secondary endpoints 
(AUClast, Cmax) with their 90% CIs were entirely within the predefined acceptance range of 80-125% 
indicating biosimilarity between the test and reference product, the upper limit of the 90% CIs for 
AUCinf and AUClast did not include 1 implying a statistical significant difference between the two 
treatments. Clearance was slightly higher with SB8 compared to Avastin which might be caused by

differences in the glycovariant profile in particular the difference in the content of high mannose. The 
impact of ADA formation on PK was investigated and it was considered that the slight difference in ADA 
formation has no causal relationship to the observed lower exposure. Overall, the clinical relevance of 
the observed differences between SB8 and EU-Avastin in certain PK parameters is considered 
negligible. 
Efficacy: 
In the initial analysis the primary endpoints best ORR by w24 failed to show equivalence with the 
upper limit of the 95% CI slightly exceeding the pre-defined comparability margin of [-12.5%, 12.5%] 
in the PPS. With the primary endpoint “best ORR by 24 weeks of the induction period” very different 
response patterns can lead to the same outcome making the treatment arms more similar. The 
applicant argued, that best ORR by 24 weeks (induction period) represents a more clinically relevant 
endpoint and therefore can detect any potential clinically meaningful difference between two products. 
It is agreed that achieving response at any time point within the induction period may be more 
clinically relevant, but for showing equivalence in efficacy a more sensitive endpoint is preferred.  
Although the applicant included results for ORR at specific time points in the initial dossier for the PPS 
at Cycle 2, Cycle 4 and Cycle 6 of the induction period, it was unclear if and how missing data due to 
discontinuation was imputed. Several imputation methods were presented by the applicant. Finally, a 
more conservative estimate of the effect difference between Onbevzi and Avastin and corresponding 
95% CI was presented upon request to investigate how large the difference could become for a 
sensitive and a clinically relevant endpoint, using a more conservative imputation method on all 
patients without tumour assessment for both, best ORR by w24 of the induction period and for ORR at 
w24/cycle 6 (further analyses were also presented for ORR at several timepoints. 
- 
In the most appropriate analysis the difference in best ORR (SB8 – EU Avastin) is 5.3% with a 
95% CI of [−2.2%, 12.7%] for PPS and 6.0% with 95% CI of [−0.9%, 12.9%] for the FAS. 
The imputation therefore revealed a lower difference between treatment arms compared to the 
initial analysis, which is reassuring. Nevertheless, the 95% CI still crosses the predefined 
comparability margin of ±12.5%.  The response rate-time curves showed that the difference in 
response favours SB8 and is highest between w20 and w30 and then slightly decreases till 
w40. With other imputation methods presented (which were not considered most appropriate), 
the difference in best ORR would be completely within a comparability range of ±12.5%. 
-  Due to the variability of tumour measurement time points, it was not possible to calculate ORR 
at Week 24. The analysis of ORR at Cycle 6 in the induction showed a difference (SB08 – EU 
Avastin) of 5.6% [95% CI: -1.8%, 13.0%] for PPS and 6.2% [95% CI: −0.6%, 13.1%] for the 
FAS. Results for PPS and FAS were similar and indicated no statistically significant difference 
between the two treatment groups. Also in this analysis the difference was smaller than in the 
analysis without missing data imputation. 
3.4.  Discussion on biosimilarity 
From a quality point of view, a comprehensive and robust biosimilarity exercise demonstrates similarity 
of the biosimilar candidate with its reference medicinal product. Differences observed at the 
physicochemical level have been sufficiently justified to have no impact on the clinical performance of 
Onbevzi and its biosimilarity to the reference medicinal product. In particular, the observed sequence 
variants, considered as product-related impurities, are adequately controlled at the level of the active 
substance release specifications. The applicant agreed to the Recommendations to consider further 
tightening of the corresponding acceptance limit when a number of batch results sufficient for 
statistical analysis is available and to submit an improved validated analytical method for their control.

No clinically relevant difference in immunogenicity to EU Avastin is expected from these product-
related substances and demonstration of biosimilarity is not questioned. 
Three non-clinical in vivo studies were submitted that strived to demonstrate biosimilarity between 
SB8 and EU or US Avastin. These studies were not required for filing a biosimilar MAA in the European 
Union, which was communicated to the applicant within an EMA scientific advice procedure. As two of 
these studies were conducted with US Avastin as comparator, their results are not unambiguously 
representative for demonstrating biosimilarity between SB8 and EU Avastin. 
The pivotal Phase I PK study demonstrated similarity, as results were within the comparability margin. 
It seems that SB8 exhibits a slightly higher clearance, which is most likely due to a higher D-mannose 
content observed with SB8. However this did not translate into lower efficacy of SB8 or have any 
impact on safety.   
The primary efficacy analysis failed to show equivalence with the upper limit of the 95% CI slightly 
exceeding the pre-defined comparability margin of [-12.5%, 12.5%].  
With the additionally requested more conservative imputation methods, the difference in best ORR by 
w24 of the induction period was smaller in the per protocol set, but still crossed slightly the upper 
margin. Difference in best ORR (SB8 – EU Avastin) is 5.3% with a 95% CI of [−2.2%, 12.7%] for PPS. 
The difference in (best) ORR seems to favour SB8 with an upper bound of the 95% CI around 13% in 
the induction period.  
Nevertheless, the analysis for the difference in ORR at Cycle 6 regardless of study period for the PPS 
resulted in an upper bound of 12.3%. This endpoint could be interpreted as a treatment policy 
estimand and better reflect the outcome in clinical practice after 6 cycles. This estimand ignores a 
change of the treatment period (induction/maintenance) within the observation period of the primary 
endpoint of 24 weeks, i.e. if concurrent chemotherapy was still applied. As patients will change to the 
maintenance period prior to 24 weeks also in clinical practice, it reflects the comparison described in 
the ICH E9 Glossary (under Intention to Treat Principle) as the effect of a treatment policy. Moreover, 
further efficacy endpoints as PFS, OS, duration of response and change in tumour burden were similar. 
Further analyses evaluating the robustness of the study data were performed, including ad-hoc 
sensitivity analyses after adjusting the covariates (e.g. tumour burden or number of Cycles for IP and 
non-IP), best ORR based on the data from Investigator’s review or different assessment time points 
and ORR at Cycle 2, Cycle 4 and Cycle 6 (regardless of study period). All of these analyses results 
showed that the treatment effect of SB8 and EU Avastin was largely comparable. 
In the efficacy/safety study, at EOT the difference in ADA formation was more pronounced: 14% of 
patients were tested ADA positive with SB8 compared to 5.6% with EU sourced Avastin, with 
statistically significant association between treatments and the ADA status at EOT (p=0.0121). Overall 
ADA incidences up to EOT should also be counted for comparison of the ADA incidences between SB8 
and EU Avastin treatment, as ADAs at EOT represent the incidence of ADA positive results at EOT 
timepoint without consideration of ‘treatment induced ADA’ or ‘treatment-boosted ADA’, ‘transient’ and 
‘inconclusive’. Samples from the patients at EOT are determined as ADA positive, regardless of ADA 
positiveness at the baseline. Up to EOT 55 (16.1%) patients in the SB8 and 37 (11%) patients in the 
EU Avastin group had overall ADAs. The clinical influence of potential differences in ADAs between the 
treatment groups on PK, efficacy and safety was investigated and revealed that the impact is 
negligible. ORR at each cycle showed no consistent trend in both subgroups. Comparison of PFS and 
DOR revealed no relevant effect of ADA development on these efficacy endpoints in both treatment 
groups. In the PK substudy of the Phase III trial SB8-G31-NSCLC, ADA formation was transient and 
showed no clear trend throughout all cycles, i.e. the incidence was not higher with SB8 in every cycle. 
In contrast, with Avastin, slightly more titre observations were observed with higher values, which 
should have a positive effect on the clearance for Avastin compared to SB8. Nevertheless, lower Ctrough

levels with SB8 were observed throughout all cycles. Furthermore also in the ADA negative subgroup, 
exposure was lower with SB8, also arguing against an effect of ADAs on the PK profile.  
The safety profiles of SB8 and EU Avastin seem largely comparable. No new safety signals were 
identified. In ADA positive patients, the number of patients discontinuing due to TEAEs was higher in 
SB8 with 10 patients (18.2%) compared to Avastin with 4 patients (10.8%) whereas discontinuations 
due to death and progressive disease were slightly higher with Avastin. When considering the causal 
relationship of these TEAEs with immunogenicity, only 2 events (anaphylaxis reaction and 
hypersensitivity) appeared to be related to immunogenicity, therefore this does not appear to preclude 
biosimilarity. 
Based on provided data it seems that the slight difference in ADA formation has no causal relationship 
to the observed lower exposure and an impact on immunogenicity and potential related consequences 
are clinically irrelevant. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The primary mechanism of action of bevacizumab is the inhibition of tumour vessel growth by blocking 
VEGF. The mode of action of bevacizumab is considered to be the same across all approved cancer 
indications. Extensive state-of-the-art characterisation studies using orthogonal physicochemical and 
biological methods were performed to demonstrate the analytical similarity between SB8 and EU 
Avastin. Furthermore, SB8 and EU Avastin showed similar biological properties. Various cell based and 
binding assays demonstrated the similarity in the key features of the MoA of bevacizumab such as 
VEGF binding and neutralisation as well as anti-proliferative effects. Extrapolation to other cancer 
indications of the reference product than advanced NSCLC is considered acceptable on the basis that 
similarity of Onbevzi/SB8 to the bevacizumab reference product (EU-Avastin) has been convincingly 
demonstrated.

3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Onbevzi 25 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is 
considered biosimilar to Avastin 25 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Onbevzi 25 mg/ml is not similar to Zejula within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.

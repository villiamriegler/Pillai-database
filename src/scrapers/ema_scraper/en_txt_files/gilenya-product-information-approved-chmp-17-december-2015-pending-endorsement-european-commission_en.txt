CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis for the following adult patient groups: 
- 
or 
- 
Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least 
one disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or 
more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain 
MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in multiple sclerosis. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Gilenya is one 0.5 mg capsule taken orally once daily. Gilenya can be 
taken with or without food. 
The same first dose monitoring as for treatment initiation is recommended when treatment is 
interrupted for: 
• 
• 
• 
If the treatment interruption is of shorter duration than the above, the treatment should be continued 
with the next dose as planned (see section 4.4). 
1 day or more during the first 2 weeks of treatment. 
more than 7 days during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment.

Special populations 
Elderly population 
Gilenya should be used with caution in patients aged 65 years and over due to insufficient data on 
safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Gilenya was not studied in patients with renal impairment in the multiple sclerosis pivotal studies. 
Based on clinical pharmacology studies, no dose adjustments are needed in patients with mild to 
severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Gilenya must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) (see 
section 4.3). Although no dose adjustments are needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment, caution should be exercised when initiating treatment in these patients (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). 
Diabetic patients 
Gilenya has not been studied in multiple sclerosis patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus. 
Gilenya should be used with caution in these patients due to a potential increase in the risk of macular 
oedema (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Regular ophthalmological examinations should be conducted in 
these patients to detect macular oedema. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Gilenya in children aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Known immunodeficiency syndrome. 
Patients with increased risk for opportunistic infections, including immunocompromised patients 
(including those currently receiving immunosuppressive therapies or those immunocompromised by 
prior therapies). 
Severe active infections, active chronic infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis). 
Known active malignancies. 
Severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Bradyarrhythmia 
Initiation of Gilenya treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and may also be associated 
with atrioventricular conduction delays, including the occurrence of isolated reports of transient, 
spontaneously resolving complete AV block (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
After the first dose, the decline in heart rate starts within one hour, and is maximal within 6 hours. 
This post-dose effect persists over the following days, although usually to a milder extent, and usually 
abates over the next weeks. With continued administration, the average heart rate returns towards 
baseline within one month. However individual patients may not return to baseline heart rate by the 
end of the first month. Conduction abnormalities were typically transient and asymptomatic. They 
usually did not require treatment and resolved within the first 24 hours on treatment. If necessary, the 
decrease in heart rate induced by fingolimod can be reversed by parenteral doses of atropine or 
isoprenaline. 
All patients should have an ECG and blood pressure measurement performed prior to and 6 hours 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after the first dose of Gilenya. All patients should be monitored for a period of 6 hours for signs and 
symptoms of bradycardia with hourly heart rate and blood pressure measurement. Continuous (real 
time) ECG monitoring during this 6 hour period is recommended. 
Should post-dose bradyarrhythmia-related symptoms occur, appropriate clinical management should 
be initiated and monitoring should be continued until the symptoms have resolved. Should a patient 
require pharmacological intervention during the first-dose monitoring, overnight monitoring in a 
medical facility should be instituted and the first-dose monitoring should be repeated after the second 
dose of Gilenya. 
If the heart rate at 6 hours is the lowest since the first dose was administered (suggesting that the 
maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not yet be manifest), monitoring should be 
extended by at least 2 hours and until heart rate increases again. Additionally, if after 6 hours, the 
heart rate is <45 bpm, or the ECG shows new onset second degree or higher grade AV block or a QTc 
interval ≥500 msec, extended monitoring (at least overnight monitoring), should be performed, and 
until the findings have resolved. The occurrence at any time of third degree AV block should also lead 
to extended monitoring (at least overnight monitoring). 
Very rare cases of T-wave inversion have been reported in patients treated with fingolimod. In case of 
T-wave inversion, the prescriber should ensure that there are no associated myocardial ischaemia 
signs or symptoms. If myocardial ischaemia is suspected, it is recommended to seek advice from a 
cardiologist. 
Due to the risk of serious rhythm disturbances, Gilenya should not be used in patients with second 
degree Mobitz type II or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block, a history of 
symptomatic bradycardia or recurrent syncope, or in patients with significant QT prolongation 
(QTc>470msec (female) or >450msec (male)). Since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated 
in patients with known ischaemic heart disease (including angina pectoris), cerebrovascular disease, 
history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrest, uncontrolled 
hypertension or severe sleep apnoea, Gilenya should not be used in these patients. In such patients, 
treatment with Gilenya should be considered only if the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential 
risks. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of 
treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring, at least overnight extended 
monitoring is recommended for treatment initiation (see also section 4.5). 
Gilenya has not been studied in patients with arrhythmias requiring treatment with class Ia (e.g. 
quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medicinal products. 
Class Ia and class III antiarrhythmic medicinal products have been associated with cases of torsades 
de pointes in patients with bradycardia. Since initiation of Gilenya treatment results in decreased heart 
rate, Gilenya should not be used concomitantly with these medicinal products. 
Experience with Gilenya is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with beta blockers, heart-
rate-lowering calcium channel blockers (such as verapamil, diltiazem or ivabradine), or other 
substances which may decrease heart rate (e.g. digoxin, anticholinesteratic agents or pilocarpine). 
Since the initiation of Gilenya treatment is also associated with slowing of the heart rate (see also 
section 4.8, Bradyarrhythmia), concomitant use of these substances during Gilenya initiation may be 
associated with severe bradycardia and heart block. Because of the potential additive effect on heart 
rate treatment with Gilenya should not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with these 
substances (see also section 4.5). In such patients, treatment with Gilenya should be considered only if 
the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential risks. If treatment with Gilenya is considered, advice 
from a cardiologist should be sought regarding the switch to non heart-rate lowering medicinal 
products prior to initiation of treatment. If the heart-rate-lowering medication cannot be stopped, 
cardiologist’s advice should be sought to determine appropriate first dose monitoring, at least 
overnight extended monitoring is recommended (see also section 4.5). 
The effects on heart rate and atrioventricular conduction may recur on re-introduction of Gilenya 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment depending on duration of the interruption and time since start of Gilenya treatment. The 
same first dose monitoring as for treatment initiation is recommended when treatment is interrupted 
for: 
• 
• 
• 
If the treatment interruption is of shorter duration than the above, the treatment should be continued 
with the next dose as planned. 
1 day or more during the first 2 weeks of treatment. 
more than 7 days during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment. 
more than 2 weeks after one month of treatment. 
QT interval 
In a thorough QT interval study of doses of 1.25 or 2.5 mg fingolimod at steady-state, when a negative 
chronotropic effect of fingolimod was still present, fingolimod treatment resulted in a prolongation of 
QTcI, with the upper limit of the 90% CI ≤13.0 ms. There is no dose- or exposure-response 
relationship of fingolimod and QTcI prolongation. There is no consistent signal of increased 
incidence of QTcI outliers, either absolute or change from baseline, associated with fingolimod 
treatment. 
The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. In the multiple sclerosis studies, clinically relevant 
effects on prolongation of the QTc-interval have not been observed but patients at risk for QT 
prolongation were not included in clinical studies. 
Medicinal products that may prolong QTc interval are best avoided in patients with relevant risk 
factors, for example, hypokalaemia or congenital QT prolongation. 
Infections 
A core pharmacodynamic effect of Gilenya is a dose-dependent reduction of the peripheral 
lymphocyte count to 20-30% of baseline values. This is due to the reversible sequestration of 
lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues (see section 5.1). 
Before initiating treatment with Gilenya, a recent complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. within 6 months 
or after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Assessments of CBC are also 
recommended periodically during treatment, at month 3 and at least yearly thereafter, and in case of 
signs of infection. Absolute lymphocyte count <0.2x109/l, if confirmed, should lead to treatment 
interruption until recovery, because in clinical studies, fingolimod treatment was interrupted in 
patients with absolute lymphocyte count <0.2x109/l. 
Initiation of treatment with Gilenya should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until 
resolution. 
Patients need to be assessed for their immunity to varicella (chickenpox) prior to Gilenya treatment. It 
is recommended that patients without a health care professional confirmed history of chickenpox or 
documentation of a full course of vaccination with varicella vaccine undergo antibody testing to 
varicella zoster virus (VZV) before initiating Gilenya therapy. A full course of vaccination for 
antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment 
with Gilenya (see section 4.8). Initiation of treatment with Gilenya should be postponed for 1 month 
to allow full effect of vaccination to occur. 
The immune system effects of Gilenya may increase the risk of infections, including opportunistic 
infections (see section 4.8). Effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be employed in 
patients with symptoms of infection while on therapy. During treatment, patients receiving Gilenya 
should be instructed to report symptoms of infection to their physician. 
Suspension of Gilenya should be considered if a patient develops a serious infection and 
consideration of benefit-risk should be undertaken prior to re-initiation of therapy. 
Isolated cases of cryptococcal meningitis (a fungal infection) have been reported in the post-
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
marketing setting (see section 4.8). Patients with symptoms and signs consistent with cryptococcal 
meningitis (e.g. headache accompanied by mental changes such as confusion, hallucinations, and/or 
personality changes) should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation. If cryptococcal meningitis is 
diagnosed, fingolimod should be suspended and appropriate treatment should be initiated. A 
multidisciplinary consultation (i.e. infectious disease specialist) should be undertaken if re-initiation 
of fingolimod is warranted. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported under fingolimod treatment 
since marketing authorisation (see section 4.8). PML is an opportunistic infection caused by John 
Cunningham virus (JCV), which may be fatal or result in severe disability. PML can only occur in the 
presence of a JCV infection. If JCV testing is undertaken, it should be considered that the influence of 
lymphopenia on the accuracy of anti-JCV antibody testing has not been studied in fingolimod-treated 
patients. It should also be noted that a negative anti-JCV antibody test does not preclude the 
possibility of subsequent JCV infection. Before initiating treatment with fingolimod, a baseline MRI 
should be available (usually within 3 months) as a reference. During routine MRI (in accordance with 
national and local recommendations), physicians should pay attention to PML suggestive lesions. 
MRI may be considered as part of increased vigilance in patients considered at increased risk of PML. 
If PML is suspected, MRI should be performed immediately for diagnostic purposes and treatment 
with fingolimod should be suspended until PML has been excluded. 
Elimination of fingolimod following discontinuation of therapy may take up to two months and 
vigilance for infection should therefore be continued throughout this period. Patients should be 
instructed to report symptoms of infection up to 2 months after discontinuation of fingolimod. 
Macular oedema 
Macular oedema with or without visual symptoms has been reported in 0.5% of patients treated with 
fingolimod 0.5 mg, occurring predominantly in the first 3-4 months of therapy (see section 4.8). An 
ophthalmological evaluation is therefore recommended at 3-4 months after treatment initiation. If 
patients report visual disturbances at any time while on therapy, evaluation of the fundus, including 
the macula, should be carried out. 
Patients with history of uveitis and patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of macular 
oedema (see section 4.8). Gilenya has not been studied in multiple sclerosis patients with concomitant 
diabetes mellitus. It is recommended that multiple sclerosis patients with diabetes mellitus or a history 
of uveitis undergo an ophthalmological evaluation prior to initiating therapy and have follow-up 
evaluations while receiving therapy. 
Continuation of Gilenya in patients with macular oedema has not been evaluated. It is recommended 
that Gilenya be discontinued if a patient develops macular oedema. A decision on whether or not 
Gilenya therapy should be re-initiated after resolution of macular oedema needs to take into account 
the potential benefits and risks for the individual patient. 
Liver function 
Increased hepatic enzymes, in particular alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) but also gamma 
glutamyltransferase (GGT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) have been reported in multiple sclerosis 
patients treated with Gilenya. In clinical trials, elevations 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or 
greater in ALT occurred in 8.0% of patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to 1.9% of 
placebo patients. Elevations 5-fold the ULN occurred in 1.8% of patients on fingolimod and 0.9% of 
patients on placebo. In clinical trials, fingolimod was discontinued if the elevation exceeded 5 times 
the ULN. Recurrence of liver transaminase elevations occurred with rechallenge in some patients, 
supporting a relationship to fingolimod. In clinical studies, transaminase elevations occurred at any 
time during treatment although the majority occurred within the first 12 months. Serum transaminase 
levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months after discontinuation of fingolimod. 
Gilenya has not been studied in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic injury (Child-Pugh class C) 
and should not be used in these patients (see section 4.3). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to the immunosuppressive properties of fingolimod, initiation of treatment should be delayed in 
patients with active viral hepatitis until resolution. 
Recent (i.e. within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels should be available before 
initiation of treatment with Gilenya. In the absence of clinical symptoms, liver transaminases should 
be monitored at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 on therapy and periodically thereafter. If liver transaminases 
rise above 5 times the ULN, more frequent monitoring should be instituted, including serum bilirubin 
and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) measurement. With repeated confirmation of liver transaminases 
above 5 times the ULN, treatment with Gilenya should be interrupted and only re-commenced once 
liver transaminase values have normalised. 
Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine, should have liver enzymes 
checked and Gilenya should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed (for example liver 
transaminase levels greater than 5-fold the ULN and/or serum bilirubin elevations). Resumption of 
therapy will be dependent on whether or not another cause of liver injury is determined and on the 
benefits to patient of resuming therapy versus the risks of recurrence of liver dysfunction. 
Although there are no data to establish that patients with pre-existing liver disease are at increased 
risk of developing elevated liver function tests when taking Gilenya, caution in the use of Gilenya 
should be exercised in patients with a history of significant liver disease. 
Interference with serological testing 
Since fingolimod reduces blood lymphocyte counts via re-distribution in secondary lymphoid organs, 
peripheral blood lymphocyte counts cannot be utilised to evaluate the lymphocyte subset status of a 
patient treated with Gilenya. Laboratory tests involving the use of circulating mononuclear cells 
require larger blood volumes due to reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes. 
Blood pressure effects 
Patients with hypertension uncontrolled by medication were excluded from participation in 
premarketing clinical trials and special care is indicated if patients with uncontrolled hypertension are 
treated with Gilenya. 
In MS clinical trials, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg had an average increase of 
approximately 3 mmHg in systolic pressure, and approximately 1 mmHg in diastolic pressure, first 
detected approximately 1 month after treatment initiation, and persisting with continued treatment. In 
the two-year placebo-controlled study, hypertension was reported as an adverse event in 6.5% of 
patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg and in 3.3% of patients on placebo. Therefore, blood pressure should 
be regularly monitored during treatment with Gilenya. 
Respiratory effects 
Minor dose-dependent reductions in values for forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and diffusion 
capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were observed with Gilenya treatment starting at Month 1 and 
remaining stable thereafter. Gilenya should be used with caution in patients with severe respiratory 
disease, pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (see also section 4.8). 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome 
Rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported at the 0.5 mg 
dose in clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.8). Symptoms reported included 
sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, visual disturbances and 
seizure. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischaemic stroke or cerebral 
haemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES 
is suspected, Gilenya should be discontinued.

Prior treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies 
There have been no studies performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Gilenya when switching 
patients from teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate or alemtuzumab treatment to Gilenya. When switching 
patients from another disease modifying therapy to Gilenya, the half-life and mode of action of the 
other therapy must be considered in order to avoid an additive immune effect whilst at the same time 
minimising the risk of disease reactivation. A CBC is recommended prior to initiating Gilenya to 
ensure that immune effects of the previous therapy (i.e. cytopenia) have resolved. 
Gilenya can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of interferon or glatiramer acetate. 
For dimethyl fumarate, the washout period should be sufficient for CBC to recover before treatment 
with Gilenya is started. 
Due to the long half-life of natalizumab, elimination usually takes up to 2-3 months following 
discontinuation. Teriflunomide is also eliminated slowly from the plasma. Without an accelerated 
elimination procedure, clearance of teriflunomide from plasma can take from several months up to 
2 years. An accelerated elimination procedure as defined in the teriflunomide summary of product 
characteristics is recommended or alternatively washout period should not be shorter than 3.5 months. 
Caution regarding potential concomitant immune effects is required when switching patients from 
natalizumab or teriflunomide to Gilenya. 
Alemtuzumab has profound and prolonged immunosuppressive effects. As the actual duration of these 
effects is unknown, initiating treatment with Gilenya after alemtuzumab is not recommended unless 
the benefits of such treatment clearly outweigh the risks for the individual patient. 
A decision to use prolonged concomitant treatment with corticosteroids should be taken after careful 
consideration. 
Co-administration with potent CYP450 inducers 
The combination of fingolimod with potent CYP450 inducers should be used with caution. 
Concomitant administration with St John’s wort is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Basal cell carcinoma 
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been reported in patients receiving Gilenya (see section 4.8). 
Vigilance for skin lesions is warranted and a medical evaluation of the skin is recommended at 
initiation, after at least one year and then at least yearly taking into consideration clinical judgement. 
The patient should be referred to a dermatologist in case suspicious lesions are detected. 
Stopping therapy 
If a decision is made to stop treatment with Gilenya a 6 week interval without therapy is needed, 
based on half-life, to clear fingolimod from the circulation (see section 5.2). Lymphocyte counts 
progressively return to normal range within 1-2 months of stopping therapy (see section 5.1). Starting 
other therapies during this interval will result in concomitant exposure to fingolimod. Use of 
immunosuppressants soon after the discontinuation of Gilenya may lead to an additive effect on the 
immune system and caution is therefore indicated. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Anti-neoplastic, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies 
Anti-neoplastic, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies should not be co-administered 
due to the risk of additive immune system effects (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Caution should also be exercised when switching patients from long-acting therapies with immune 
effects such as natalizumab, teriflunomide or mitoxantrone (see section 4.4). In multiple sclerosis 
clinical studies the concomitant treatment of relapses with a short course of corticosteroids was not 
associated with an increased rate of infection. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vaccination 
During and for up to two months after treatment with Gilenya vaccination may be less effective. The 
use of live attenuated vaccines may carry a risk of infections and should therefore be avoided (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Bradycardia-inducing substances 
Fingolimod has been studied in combination with atenolol and diltiazem. When fingolimod was used 
with atenolol in an interaction study in healthy volunteers, there was an additional 15% reduction of 
heart rate at fingolimod treatment initiation, an effect not seen with diltiazem. Treatment with Gilenya 
should not be initiated in patients receiving beta blockers, or other substances which may decrease 
heart rate, such as class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers (such as ivabradine, 
verapamil or diltiazem), digoxin, anticholinesteratic agents or pilocarpine because of the potential 
additive effects on heart rate (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If treatment with Gilenya is considered in 
such patients, advice from a cardiologist should be sought regarding the switch to non heart-rate 
lowering medicinal products or appropriate monitoring for treatment initiation, at least overnight 
monitoring is recommended, if the heart-rate-lowering medication cannot be stopped. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions of other substances on fingolimod 
Fingolimod is metabolised mainly by CYP4F2. Other enzymes like CYP3A4 may also contribute to 
its metabolism, notably in the case of strong induction of CYP3A4. Potent inhibitors of transporter 
proteins are not expected to influence fingolimod disposition. Co-administration of fingolimod with 
ketoconazole resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate exposure (AUC) 
by inhibition of CYP4F2. Caution should be exercised with substances that may inhibit CYP3A4 
(protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, some macrolides such as clarithromycin or telithromycin). 
Co-administration of carbamazepine 600 mg twice daily at steady-state and a single dose of 
fingolimod 2 mg reduced the AUC of fingolimod and its metabolite by approximately 40%. Other 
strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers, for example rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, efavirenz and St. 
John’s Wort, may reduce the AUC of fingolimod and its metabolite at least to this extent. As this 
could potentially impair the efficacy, their co-administration should be used with caution. 
Concomitant administration with St. John’s Wort is however not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Pharmacokinetic interactions of fingolimod on other substances 
Fingolimod is unlikely to interact with substances mainly cleared by the CYP450 enzymes or by 
substrates of the main transporter proteins. 
Co-administration of fingolimod with ciclosporin did not elicit any change in the ciclosporin or 
fingolimod exposure. Therefore, fingolimod is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of 
medicinal products that are CYP3A4 substrates. 
Co-administration of fingolimod with oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) did not 
elicit any change in oral contraceptive exposure. No interaction studies have been performed with oral 
contraceptives containing other progestagens, however an effect of fingolimod on their exposure is 
not expected. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in females 
Before initiation of Gilenya treatment, women of childbearing potential should be counselled 
regarding the potential for serious risk to the foetus and the need for effective contraception during 
treatment with Gilenya. Since it takes approximately two months to eliminate fingolimod from the 
body on stopping treatment (see section 4.4), the potential risk to the foetus may persist and 
contraception should be continued during that period. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
Before initiation of treatment in women of childbearing potential a negative pregnancy test result 
needs to be available. While on treatment, women should not become pregnant and active 
contraception is recommended. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gilenya, discontinuation 
of Gilenya is recommended. 
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity including foetal loss and organ defects, notably 
persistent truncus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect (see section 5.3). Furthermore, the receptor 
affected by fingolimod (sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor) is known to be involved in vascular 
formation during embryogenesis. There are very limited data from the use of fingolimod in pregnant 
women. 
There are no data on the effects of fingolimod on labour and delivery. 
Breast-feeding 
Fingolimod is excreted in milk of treated animals during lactation at concentrations 2-3-fold higher 
than that found in maternal plasma (see section 5.3). Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions 
to fingolimod in nursing infants, women receiving Gilenya should not breastfeed. 
Fertility 
Data from preclinical studies do not suggest that fingolimod would be associated with an increased 
risk of reduced fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Gilenya has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
However, dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur when initiating therapy with Gilenya. On 
initiation of Gilenya treatment it is recommended that patients be observed for a period of 6 hours 
(see section 4.4, Bradyarrhythmia). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety population of Gilenya is derived from two Phase III placebo-controlled clinical studies and 
one Phase III active-controlled clinical study in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. It 
includes a total of 2,431 patients on Gilenya (0.5 or 1.25 mg). Study D2301 (FREEDOMS) was a 2-
year placebo-controlled clinical study in 854 patients treated with fingolimod (placebo: 418). Study 
D2309 (FREEDOMS II) was a 2-year placebo-controlled clinical study in 728 multiple sclerosis 
patients treated with fingolimod (placebo: 355). In the pooled data from these two studies the most 
serious adverse reactions on Gilenya 0.5 mg were infections, macular oedema and transient 
atrioventricular block at treatment initiation. The most frequent adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) 
on Gilenya 0.5 mg were influenza, sinusitis, headache, diarrhoea, back pain, hepatic enzyme increased 
and cough. The most frequent adverse reaction reported for Gilenya 0.5 mg leading to treatment 
interruption was ALT elevations (2.2%). The adverse reactions in Study D2302 (TRANSFORMS), a 
1-year study in 849 patients treated with fingolimod which used interferon beta-1a as comparator, 
were generally similar to placebo-controlled studies, taking into account the differences in study 
duration. 
Adverse reactions reported with Gilenya 0.5 mg in Studies D2301 (FREEDOMS) and D2309

** 
***  Adverse drug reactions from spontaneous reports and literature 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
In multiple sclerosis clinical studies the overall rate of infections (65.1%) at the 0.5 mg dose was 
similar to placebo. However, lower respiratory tract infections, primarily bronchitis and to a lesser 
extent herpes infection and pneumonia were more common in Gilenya-treated patients. 
Some cases of disseminated herpes infection, including fatal cases, have been reported even at the 
0.5 mg dose. 
In the post-marketing setting, cases of infections with opportunistic pathogens, such as viral (e.g. 
varicella zoster virus [VZV], John Cunningham virus [JCV] causing Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy, herpes simplex virus [HSV]), fungal (e.g. cryptococci including cryptococcal 
meningitis) or bacterial (e.g. atypical mycobacterium), have been reported (see section 4.4). 
Macular oedema 
In multiple sclerosis clinical studies macular oedema occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with the 
recommended dose of 0.5 mg and 1.1% of patients treated with the higher dose of 1.25 mg. The 
majority of cases occurred within the first 3-4 months of therapy. Some patients presented with 
blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were asymptomatic and diagnosed on routine 
ophthalmological examination. The macular oedema generally improved or resolved spontaneously 
after discontinuation of Gilenya. The risk of recurrence after re-challenge has not been evaluated. 
Macular oedema incidence is increased in multiple sclerosis patients with a history of uveitis (17% 
with a history of uveitis vs. 0.6% without a history of uveitis). Gilenya has not been studied in 
multiple sclerosis patients with diabetes mellitus, a disease which is associated with an increased risk 
for macular oedema (see section 4.4). In renal transplant clinical studies in which patients with 
diabetes mellitus were included, therapy with fingolimod 2.5 mg and 5 mg resulted in a 2-fold 
increase in the incidence of macular oedema. 
Bradyarrhythmia 
Initiation of Gilenya treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and may also be associated 
with atrioventricular conduction delays. In multiple sclerosis clinical studies the maximal decline in 
heart rate was seen within 6 hours after treatment initiation, with declines in mean heart rate of 
12-13 beats per minute for Gilenya 0.5 mg. Heart rate below 40 beats per minute was rarely observed 
in patients on Gilenya 0.5 mg. The average heart rate returned towards baseline within 1 month of 
chronic treatment. Bradycardia was generally asymptomatic but some patients experienced mild to 
moderate symptoms, including hypotension, dizziness, fatigue and/or palpitations, which resolved 
within the first 24 hours after treatment initiation (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
In multiple sclerosis clinical studies first-degree atrioventricular block (prolonged PR interval on 
ECG) was detected after treatment initiation in 4.7% of patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg, in 2.8% of 
patients on intramuscular interferon beta-1a, and in 1.6% of patients on placebo. Second-degree 
atrioventricular block was detected in less than 0.2% patients on Gilenya 0.5 mg. In the post-
marketing setting, isolated reports of transient, spontaneously resolving complete AV block have been 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
observed during the six hour monitoring period following the first dose of Gilenya. The patients 
recovered spontaneously. The conduction abnormalities observed both in clinical trials and post-
marketing were typically transient, asymptomatic and resolved within the first 24 hours after 
treatment initiation. Although most patients did not require medical intervention, one patient on 
Gilenya 0.5 mg received isoprenaline for asymptomatic second-degree Mobitz I atrioventricular 
block. 
In the post-marketing setting, isolated delayed onset events, including transient asystole and 
unexplained death, have occurred within 24 hours of the first dose. These cases have been confounded 
by concomitant medicinal products and/or pre-existing disease. The relationship of such events to 
Gilenya is uncertain. 
Blood pressure 
In multiple sclerosis clinical studies Gilenya 0.5 mg was associated with an average increase of 
approximately 3 mmHg in systolic pressure and approximately 1 mmHg in diastolic pressure, 
manifesting approximately 1 month after treatment initiation. This increase persisted with continued 
treatment. Hypertension was reported in 6.5% of patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg and in 3.3% of 
patients on placebo. In the post-marketing setting, cases of hypertension have been reported within the 
first month of treatment initiation and on the first day of treatment that may require treatment with 
antihypertensive agents or discontinuation of Gilenya (see also section 4.4, Blood pressure effects). 
Liver function 
Increased hepatic enzymes have been reported in multiple sclerosis patients treated with Gilenya. In 
clinical studies 8.0% and 1.8% of patients treated with Gilenya 0.5 mg experienced an asymptomatic 
elevation in serum levels of ALT of ≥3x ULN (upper limit of normal) and ≥5x ULN, respectively. 
Recurrence of liver transaminase elevations has occurred upon re-challenge in some patients, 
supporting a relationship to the medicinal product. In clinical studies, transaminase elevations 
occurred at any time during treatment although the majority occurred within the first 12 months. ALT 
levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months after discontinuation of Gilenya. In a small 
number of patients (N=10 on 1.25 mg, N=2 on 0.5 mg) who experienced ALT elevations ≥5x ULN 
and who continued on Gilenya therapy, the ALT levels returned to normal within approximately 
5 months (see also section 4.4, Liver function). 
Nervous system disorders 
In clinical studies, rare events involving the nervous system occurred in patients treated with 
fingolimod at higher doses (1.25 or 5.0 mg) including ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes and 
neurological atypical disorders, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like events. 
Vascular disorders 
Rare cases of peripheral arterial occlusive disease occurred in patients treated with fingolimod at 
higher doses (1.25 mg). 
Respiratory system 
Minor dose-dependent reductions in values for forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and diffusion 
capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were observed with Gilenya treatment starting at Month 1 and 
remaining stable thereafter. At Month 24, the reduction from baseline values in percentage of 
predicted FEV1 was 2.7% for fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1.2% for placebo, a difference that resolved after 
treatment discontinuation. For DLCO the reductions at Month 24 were 3.3% for fingolimod 0.5 mg 
and 2.7% for placebo. 
Lymphomas 
There have been cases of lymphoma of different varieties, in both clinical studies and the post-
marketing setting, including a fatal case of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive B-cell lymphoma. The 
incidence of lymphoma (B-cell and T-cell) cases was higher in clinical trials than expected in the 
general population. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Haemophagocytic syndrome 
Very rare cases of haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) with fatal outcome have been reported in 
patients treated with fingolimod in the context of an infection. HPS is a rare condition that has been 
described in association with infections, immunosuppression and a variety of autoimmune diseases. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single doses up to 80 times the recommended dose (0.5 mg) were well tolerated in healthy volunteers. 
At 40 mg, 5 of 6 subjects reported mild chest tightness or discomfort which was clinically consistent 
with small airway reactivity. 
Fingolimod can induce bradycardia upon treatment initiation. The decline in heart rate usually starts 
within one hour of the first dose, and is steepest within 6 hours. The negative chronotropic effect of 
Gilenya persists beyond 6 hours and progressively attenuates over subsequent days of treatment (see 
section 4.4 for details). There have been reports of slow atrioventricular conduction, with isolated 
reports of transient, spontaneously resolving complete AV block (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
If the overdose constitutes first exposure to Gilenya, it is important to monitor patients with a 
continuous (real time) ECG and hourly measurement of heart rate and blood pressure, at least during 
the first 6 hours (see section 4.4). 
Additionally, if after 6 hours the heart rate is <45 bpm or if the ECG at 6 hours after the first dose 
shows second degree or higher AV block, or if it shows a QTc interval ≥500 msec, monitoring should 
be extended at least for overnight and until the findings have resolved. The occurrence at any time of 
third degree AV block should also lead to extended monitoring including overnight monitoring. 
Neither dialysis nor plasma exchange results in removal of fingolimod from the body. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA27 
Mechanism of action 
Fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. Fingolimod is metabolised by 
sphingosine kinase to the active metabolite fingolimod phosphate. Fingolimod phosphate binds at low 
nanomolar concentrations to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 located on lymphocytes, and 
readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to bind to S1P receptor 1 located on neural cells in the central 
nervous system (CNS). By acting as a functional antagonist of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, 
fingolimod phosphate blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, causing a 
redistribution, rather than depletion, of lymphocytes. Animal studies have shown that this 
redistribution reduces the infiltration of pathogenic lymphocytes, including pro-inflammatory Th17 
cells, into the CNS, where they would be involved in nerve inflammation and nervous tissue damage. 
Animal studies and in vitro experiments indicate that fingolimod may also act via interaction with S1P 
receptors on neural cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Within 4-6 hours after the first dose of fingolimod 0.5 mg, the lymphocyte count decreases to 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 75% of baseline in peripheral blood. With continued daily dosing, the lymphocyte 
count continues to decrease over a two-week period, reaching a minimal count of approximately 
500 cells/microlitre or approximately 30% of baseline. Eighteen percent of patients reached a minimal 
count below 200 cells/microlitre on at least one occasion. Low lymphocyte counts are maintained 
with chronic daily dosing. The majority of T and B lymphocytes regularly traffic through lymphoid 
organs and these are the cells mainly affected by fingolimod. Approximately 15-20% of T 
lymphocytes have an effector memory phenotype, cells that are important for peripheral immune 
surveillance. Since this lymphocyte subset typically does not traffic to lymphoid organs it is not 
affected by fingolimod. Peripheral lymphocyte count increases are evident within days of stopping 
fingolimod treatment and typically normal counts are reached within one to two months. Chronic 
fingolimod dosing leads to a mild decrease in the neutrophil count to approximately 80% of baseline. 
Monocytes are unaffected by fingolimod. 
Fingolimod causes a transient reduction in heart rate and decrease in atrioventricular conduction at 
treatment initiation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The maximal decline in heart rate is seen within 6 hours 
post dose, with 70% of the negative chronotropic effect achieved on the first day. With continued 
administration heart rate returns to baseline within one month. The decrease in heart rate induced by 
fingolimod can be reversed by parenteral doses of atropine or isoprenaline. Inhaled salmeterol has 
also been shown to have a modest positive chronotropic effect. With initiation of fingolimod 
treatment there is an increase in atrial premature contractions, but there is no increased rate of atrial 
fibrillation/flutter or ventricular arrhythmias or ectopy. Fingolimod treatment is not associated with a 
decrease in cardiac output. Autonomic responses of the heart, including diurnal variation of heart rate 
and response to exercise are not affected by fingolimod treatment. 
Fingolimod treatment with single or multiple doses of 0.5 and 1.25 mg for two weeks is not associated 
with a detectable increase in airway resistance as measured by FEV1 and forced expiratory flow rate 
(FEF) 25-75. However, single fingolimod doses ≥5 mg (10-fold the recommended dose) are 
associated with a dose-dependent increase in airway resistance. Fingolimod treatment with multiple 
doses of 0.5, 1.25, or 5 mg is not associated with impaired oxygenation or oxygen desaturation with 
exercise or an increase in airway responsiveness to methacholine. Subjects on fingolimod treatment 
have a normal bronchodilator response to inhaled beta-agonists. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Gilenya has been demonstrated in two studies which evaluated once-daily doses of 
fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Both 
studies included patients who had experienced ≥2 relapses in the prior 2 years or ≥1 relapse during the 
prior year. Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) was between 0 and 5.5. A third study targeting 
the same patient population was completed after registration of Gilenya. 
Study D2301 (FREEDOMS) was a 2-year randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III 
study of 1,272 patients (n=425 on 0.5 mg, 429 on 1.25 mg, 418 on placebo). Median values for 
baseline characteristics were: age 37 years, disease duration 6.7 years, and EDSS score 2.0. Outcome 
results are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences between the 0.5 mg and the 
1.25 mg doses as regards either endpoint.

Patients who completed the 24-month core FREEDOMS study could enter a dose-blinded extension 
study (D2301E1) and receive fingolimod. In total, 920 patients entered (n=331 continued on 0.5 mg, 
289 continued on 1.25 mg, 155 switched from placebo to 0.5 mg and 145 switched from placebo to 
1.25 mg). After 12 months (month 36), 856 patients (93%) were still enrolled. Between months 24 and 
36, the annualised relapse rate (ARR) for patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core study who 
remained on 0.5 mg was 0.17 (0.21 in the core study). The ARR for patients who switched from 
placebo to fingolimod 0.5 mg was 0.22 (0.42 in the core study). 
Comparable results were shown in a replicate 2-year randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Phase III study on fingolimod in 1,083 patients (n=358 on 0.5 mg, 370 on 1.25 mg, 355 on placebo)

Patients who completed the 12-month core TRANSFORMS study could enter a dose-blinded 
extension (D2302E1) and receive fingolimod. In total, 1,030 patients entered, however, 3 of these 
patients did not receive treatment (n=356 continued on 0.5 mg, 330 continued on 1.25 mg, 167 
switched from interferon beta-1a to 0.5 mg and 174 from interferon beta-1a to 1.25 mg). After 
12 months (month 24), 882 patients (86%) were still enrolled. Between months 12 and 24, the ARR 
for patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core study who remained on 0.5 mg was 0.20 (0.19 in the 
core study). The ARR for patients who switched from interferon beta-1a to fingolimod 0.5 mg was 
0.33 (0.48 in the core study). 
Pooled results of Studies D2301 and D2302 showed a consistent and statistically significant reduction 
in annualised relapse rate compared to comparator in subgroups defined by gender, age, prior multiple 
sclerosis therapy, disease activity or disability levels at baseline. 
Further analyses of clinical trial data demonstrate consistent treatment effects in highly active 
subgroups of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Gilenya in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetic data were obtained in healthy volunteers, in renal transplant patients and in multiple 
sclerosis patients. 
The pharmacologically active metabolite responsible for efficacy is fingolimod phosphate. 
Absorption 
Fingolimod absorption is slow (tmax of 12-16 hours) and extensive (≥85%). The apparent absolute oral 
bioavailability is 93% (95% confidence interval: 79-111%). Steady-state-blood concentrations are 
reached within 1 to 2 months following once-daily administration and steady-state levels are 
approximately 10-fold greater than with the initial dose. 
Food intake does not alter Cmax or exposure (AUC) of fingolimod. Fingolimod phosphate Cmax was 
slightly increased by 34% but AUC was unchanged. Therefore, Gilenya may be taken without regard 
to meals (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Fingolimod highly distributes in red blood cells, with the fraction in blood cells of 86%. Fingolimod 
phosphate has a smaller uptake in blood cells of <17%. Fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate are 
highly protein bound (>99%). 
Fingolimod is extensively distributed to body tissues with a volume of distribution of about 
1,200±260 litres. A study in four healthy subjects who received a single intravenous dose of a 
radioiodolabelled analogue of fingolimod demonstrated that fingolimod penetrates into the brain. In a 
study in 13 male multiple sclerosis patients who received Gilenya 0.5 mg/day, the mean amount of 
fingolimod (and fingolimod phosphate) in seminal ejaculate, at steady-state, was approximately 
10,000 times lower than the oral dose administered (0.5 mg). 
Biotransformation 
Fingolimod is transformed in humans by reversible stereoselective phosphorylation to the 
pharmacologically active (S)-enantiomer of fingolimod phosphate. Fingolimod is eliminated by 
oxidative biotransformation catalysed mainly via CYP4F2 and possibly other isoenzymes and 
subsequent fatty acid-like degradation to inactive metabolites. Formation of pharmacologically 
inactive non-polar ceramide analogues of fingolimod was also observed. The main enzyme involved 
in the metabolism of fingolimod is partially identified and may be either CYP4F2 or CYP3A4. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following single oral administration of [14C] fingolimod, the major fingolimod-related components in 
blood, as judged from their contribution to the AUC up to 34 days post dose of total radiolabelled 
components, are fingolimod itself (23%), fingolimod phosphate (10%), and inactive metabolites (M3 
carboxylic acid metabolite (8%), M29 ceramide metabolite (9%) and M30 ceramide metabolite (7%)). 
Elimination 
Fingolimod blood clearance is 6.3±2.3 l/h, and the average apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) is 
6-9 days. Blood levels of fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate decline in parallel in the terminal 
phase, leading to similar half-lives for both. 
After oral administration, about 81% of the dose is slowly excreted in the urine as inactive 
metabolites. Fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate are not excreted intact in urine but are the major 
components in the faeces, with amounts representing less than 2.5% of the dose each. After 34 days, 
the recovery of the administered dose is 89%. 
Linearity 
Fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate concentrations increase in an apparently dose proportional 
manner after multiple once-daily doses of 0.5 mg or 1.25 mg. 
Characteristics in specific groups of patients 
The pharmacokinetics of fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate do not differ in males and females, in 
patients of different ethnic origin, or in patients with mild to severe renal impairment. 
In subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B, and C), no 
change in fingolimod Cmax was observed, but fingolimod AUC was increased respectively by 12%, 
44%, and 103%. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), fingolimod-
phosphate Cmax was decreased by 22% and AUC was not substantially changed. The pharmacokinetics 
of fingolimod-phosphate were not evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
The apparent elimination half-life of fingolimod is unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment, but is prolonged by about 50% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 
Fingolimod should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) (see 
section 4.3). Fingolimod should be introduced cautiously in mild and moderate hepatic impaired 
patients (see section 4.2). 
Clinical experience and pharmacokinetic information in patients aged above 65 years are limited. 
Gilenya should be used with caution in patients aged 65 years and over (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
There are limited data available from a renal transplant study that included 7 children above 11 years 
of age (study FTY720A0115). The comparison of these data to those in adult healthy volunteers is of 
limited relevance and no valid conclusions can be drawn regarding the pharmacokinetic properties of 
fingolimod in children. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The preclinical safety profile of fingolimod was assessed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. The major 
target organs were the lymphoid system (lymphopenia and lymphoid atrophy), lungs (increased 
weight, smooth muscle hypertrophy at the bronchio-alveolar junction), and heart (negative 
chronotropic effect, increase in blood pressure, perivascular changes and myocardial degeneration) in 
several species; blood vessels (vasculopathy) in rats only at doses of 0.15 mg/kg and higher in a 2-
year study, representing an approximate 4-fold margin based on the human systemic exposure (AUC) 
at a daily dose of 0.5 mg. 
No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in a 2-year bioassay in rats at oral doses of fingolimod

up to the maximally tolerated dose of 2.5 mg/kg, representing an approximate 50-fold margin based 
on human systemic exposure (AUC) at the 0.5 mg dose. However, in a 2-year mouse study, an 
increased incidence of malignant lymphoma was seen at doses of 0.25 mg/kg and higher, representing 
an approximate 6-fold margin based on the human systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of 
0.5 mg. 
Fingolimod was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in animal studies. 
Fingolimod had no effect on sperm count/motility or on fertility in male and female rats up to the 
highest dose tested (10 mg/kg), representing an approximate 150-fold margin based on human 
systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of 0.5 mg. 
Fingolimod was teratogenic in the rat when given at doses of 0.1 mg/kg or higher. The most common 
foetal visceral malformations included persistent truncus arteriosus and ventricular septum defect. 
The teratogenic potential in rabbits could not be fully assessed, however an increased embryo-foetal 
mortality was seen at doses of 1.5 mg/kg and higher, and a decrease in viable foetuses as well as 
foetal growth retardation was seen at 5 mg/kg. 
In rats, F1 generation pup survival was decreased in the early postpartum period at doses that did not 
cause maternal toxicity. However, F1 body weights, development, behaviour, and fertility were not 
affected by treatment with fingolimod. 
Fingolimod was excreted in milk of treated animals during lactation. Fingolimod and its metabolites 
crossed the placental barrier in pregnant rabbits. 
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
A risk for the environment due to use of Gilenya by patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis is not 
expected.

subsequent updates of the RMP. 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
• 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the 
same time. 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
• 
Prior to launch in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall agree the 
educational material with the National Competent Authority. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH shall ensure that, following discussions and agreement with the National Competent 
Authorities in each Member State where GILENYA is marketed, at launch and after launch all 
physicians who intend to prescribe GILENYA are provided with an updated physician information 
pack containing the following elements: 
•  The Summary of Product Characteristics 
•  Physician’s checklist prior to prescribing GILENYA 
•  Information about the Fingolimod Pregnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring Program and 
Pregnancy Exposure Registry  
•  Patient reminder card 
The physician’s checklist shall contain the following key messages: 
o  Monitoring requirements at treatment initiation 
Before first dose 
o 
o 
o 
o 
Perform baseline ECG prior to the first dose of GILENYA. 
Perform blood pressure measurement prior to the first dose of GILENYA. 
Perform a liver function test prior to treatment initiation. 
Arrange ophthalmological assessment prior to initiation with GILENYA in patients with 
diabetes mellitus or with a history of uveitis. 
Until 6 hours after first dose 
o  Monitor the patient for 6 hours after the first dose of GILENYA has been administered 
for signs and symptoms of bradycardia, including hourly pulse and blood pressure 
checks. Continuous (real time) ECG monitoring is recommended. 
Perform an ECG at the end of the 6-hour monitoring period. 
o 
>6 to 8 hours after first dose 
o 
If, at the 6-hour time point, the heart rate is at the lowest value following the first dose, 
extend heart rate monitoring for at least 2 more hours and until the heart rate increases 
again. 
o 
Recommendation for re-initiation of GILENYA therapy after treatment interruption 
The same first dose monitoring as for treatment initiation is recommended when: 
o 
o 
o 
treatment is interrupted for one day or more during the first 2 weeks of treatment. 
treatment is interrupted for more than 7 days during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment. 
treatment is interrupted for more than 2 weeks after at least 1 month of treatment. 
o 
Recommendation for overnight monitoring after the first dose (or if the first dose monitoring 
applies during treatment re-initiation) 
Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until resolution of 
findings in patients requiring pharmacological intervention during monitoring at treatment 
initiation/re-initiation. Repeat the first dose monitoring after the second dose of GILENYA. 
Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until resolution of 
findings in patients: 
o  With third degree AV block occurring at any time. 
o  Where at the 6-hour time point: 
• 
• 
• 
Heart rate <45 bpm. 
New onset second degree or higher AV block. 
QTc interval ≥500 msec. 
o 
That GILENYA is not recommended in patients with: 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Second degree Mobitz Type II or higher AV block 
Sick-sinus syndrome 
Sino-atrial heart block 
QTc prolongation >470 msec (females) or >450 msec (males) 
Ischaemic cardiac disease including angina pectoris 
Cerebrovascular disease 
History of myocardial infarction 
Congestive heart failure 
History of cardiac arrest 
Severe sleep apnoea 
History of symptomatic bradycardia 
History of recurrent syncope 
Uncontrolled hypertension 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
If GILENYA treatment is considered in these patients anticipated benefits must outweigh 
potential risks and a cardiologist must be consulted to determine appropriate monitoring, at 
least overnight extended monitoring is recommended. 
GILENYA is not recommended in patients concomitantly taking Class Ia or Class III anti-
arrhythmic medicines. 
GILENYA is not recommended in patients concomitantly taking medicines which are known to 
decrease the heart rate. If GILENYA treatment is considered in these patients anticipated 
benefits must outweigh potential risks and a cardiologist must be consulted to switch to non 
heart-rate-lowering therapy or, if not possible, to determine appropriate monitoring. At least 
overnight extended monitoring is recommended. 
GILENYA reduces peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. There is a need to check the patient’s 
peripheral lymphocyte count (CBC) prior to initiation and to monitor during treatment with 
GILENYA. 
GILENYA may increase the risk of infections. Treatment initiation in patients with severe 
active infection should be delayed until the infection is resolved. Suspension of treatment 
during serious infections should be considered. Anti-neoplastic, immunomodulatory or 
immunosuppressive therapies should not be co-administered due to the risk of additive immune 
system effects. For the same reason, a decision to use prolonged concomitant treatment with 
corticosteroids should be taken after careful consideration. 
The need to instruct patients to report signs and symptoms of infections immediately to their 
prescriber during and for up to two months after treatment with GILENYA. 
Specific recommendations regarding vaccination for patients initiating or currently on 
GILENYA treatment. 
The need for a full ophthalmological assessment 3-4 months after starting GILENYA therapy 
for the early detection of visual impairment due to drug-induced macular oedema. 
The need for ophthalmological assessment during treatment with GILENYA in patients with 
diabetes mellitus or with a history of uveitis. 
The teratogenic risk of GILENYA: the importance of avoiding pregnancy when undergoing 
treatment with GILENYA and the need for a negative pregnancy test result prior to treatment 
initiation. This should be repeated at suitable intervals. 
The need to advise women of child-bearing potential on the serious risk to the foetus and the 
need to practice effective contraception during treatment and for at least two months following 
discontinuation of treatment with GILENYA.

o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o 
o 
The need for liver function monitoring at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 during GILENYA therapy 
and periodically thereafter. 
The need to provide patients with the patient reminder card. 
The patient reminder card shall contain the following key messages: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
• 
That they will have a baseline ECG and blood pressure measurement prior to the first dose of 
GILENYA. 
That their heart rate will need to be monitored for 6 or more hours after the first dose of 
GILENYA, including hourly pulse and blood pressure checks. Patients may be monitored with 
a continuous ECG during the first 6 hours. They will need an ECG at 6 hours and in some 
circumstances monitoring may involve an overnight stay. 
The need to call the doctor in case of treatment interruption as the 1st dose monitoring may need 
to be repeated depending on duration of the interruption and time since start of GILENYA 
treatment. 
The need to report immediately symptoms indicating low heart rate (such as dizziness, vertigo, 
nausea or palpitations) after the first dose of GILENYA. 
GILENYA is not recommended in patients with cardiac disease or those taking medicines 
concomitantly known to decrease heart rate and they should tell any doctor they see that they 
are being treated with GILENYA. 
The signs and symptoms of infection and the need to report these immediately to the prescriber 
during and up to two months after treatment with GILENYA. 
The need to report any symptoms of visual impairment immediately to the prescriber during 
and for up to two months after the end of treatment with GILENYA. 
That GILENYA is teratogenic so women with childbearing potential must: 
o 
o 
Have a negative pregnancy test. 
Be using effective contraception during and for at least two months following 
discontinuation of treatment with GILENYA. 
Report any (intended or unintended) pregnancy during and two months following 
discontinuation of treatment with GILENYA immediately to the prescriber. 
o 
The need for a liver function test prior to treatment initiation and for liver function monitoring 
at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 during GILENYA therapy and periodically thereafter.

The active substance of Gilenya is fingolimod. 
What Gilenya is used for 
Gilenya is used in adults to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), more specifically in: 
Patients who have failed to respond despite treatment with an MS treatment. 
or 
Patients who have rapidly evolving severe MS. 
Gilenya does not cure MS, but it helps to reduce the number of relapses and to slow down the 
progression of physical disabilities due to MS. 
What is multiple sclerosis 
MS is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), comprised of the brain and 
spinal cord. In MS inflammation destroys the protective sheath (called myelin) around the nerves in 
the CNS and stops the nerves from working properly. This is called demyelination. 
Relapsing-remitting MS is characterised by repeated attacks (relapses) of nervous system symptoms 
that reflect inflammation within the CNS. Symptoms vary from patient to patient but typically involve 
walking difficulties, numbness, vision problems or disturbed balance. Symptoms of a relapse may 
disappear completely when the relapse is over, but some problems may remain. 
How Gilenya works 
Gilenya helps to protect against attacks on the CNS by the immune system by reducing the ability of 
some white blood cells (lymphocytes) to move freely within the body and by stopping them from 
reaching the brain and spinal cord. This limits nerve damage caused by MS.

2.  What you need to know before you take Gilenya 
Do not take Gilenya 
- 
if you have a lowered immune response (due to an immunodeficiency syndrome, a disease or 
to medicines that suppress the immune system). 
if you have a severe active infection or active chronic infection such as hepatitis or 
tuberculosis. 
if you have an active cancer. 
if you have severe liver problems. 
if you are allergic to fingolimod or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Gilenya. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Gilenya: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have irregular, abnormal heart beat. 
if you suffer from symptoms of slow heart rate (e.g. dizziness, nausea, or palpitations). 
if you have any heart problems, blocked heart blood vessels, have had a heart attack, have 
a history of your heart having stopped or if you have angina. 
if you have had a stroke. 
if you suffer from heart failure. 
if you have severe breathing problems during sleep (severe sleep apnoea). 
if you have been told you have an abnormal electrocardiogram. 
if you are taking or have recently taken medicine for irregular heartbeat such as quinidine, 
disopyramide, amiodarone or sotalol. 
if you are taking or have recently taken medicines that slow your heart rate (such as beta 
blockers, verapamil, diltiazem or ivabradine, digoxin, anticholinesteratic agents or pilocarpine). 
if you have a history of sudden loss of consciousness or fainting (syncope). 
if you plan to get vaccinated. 
if you have never had chickenpox. 
if you have or have had visual disturbances or other signs of swelling in the central vision 
area (macula) at the back of the eye (a condition known as macular oedema, see below), 
inflammation or infection of the eye (uveitis), or if you have diabetes (which can cause eye 
problems). 
if you have liver problems. 
if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by medicines. 
if you have severe lung problems or smoker’s cough. 
- 
- 
- 
If any of these applies to you, tell your doctor before taking Gilenya. 
Slow heart rate (bradycardia) and irregular heartbeat: At the beginning of treatment, Gilenya 
causes the heart rate to slow down. As a result, you may feel dizzy or tired, or be consciously aware of 
your heartbeat, or your blood pressure may drop. If these effects are pronounced, tell your doctor, 
because you may need treatment right away. Gilenya can also cause an irregular heartbeat, 
especially after the first dose. Irregular heartbeat usually returns to normal in less than one day. Slow 
heart rate usually returns to normal within one month. 
Your doctor will ask you to stay at the surgery or clinic for at least 6 hours, with hourly pulse and 
blood pressure measurements, after taking the first dose of Gilenya so that appropriate measures can 
be taken in the event of side effects that occur at the start of treatment. You should have an 
electrocardiogram performed prior to the first dose of Gilenya and after the 6-hour monitoring period. 
Your doctor may monitor your electrocardiogram continuously during that time. If after the 6-hour 
period you have a very slow or decreasing heart rate, or if your electrocardiogram shows 
abnormalities, you may need to be monitored for a longer period (at least 2 more hours and possibly 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overnight) until these have resolved. The same may apply if you are resuming Gilenya after a break in 
treatment, depending on both how long the break was and how long you had been taking Gilenya 
before the break. 
If you have, or if you are at risk for, an irregular or abnormal heartbeat, if your electrocardiogram is 
abnormal, or if you have heart disease or heart failure, Gilenya may not be appropriate for you. 
If you have a history of sudden loss of consciousness or decreased heart rate, Gilenya may not be 
appropriate for you. You will be evaluated by a cardiologist (heart specialist) to advise how you 
should start treatment with Gilenya, including overnight monitoring. 
If you are taking medicines that can cause your heart rate to decrease, Gilenya may not be appropriate 
for you. You will need to be evaluated by a cardiologist, who will check whether you can be switched 
to alternative medication that does not decrease your heart rate in order to allow treatment with 
Gilenya. If such a switch is impossible, the cardiologist will advise how you should start treatment 
with Gilenya, including overnight monitoring. 
If you have never had chickenpox: If you have never had chickenpox, your doctor will check your 
immunity against the virus that causes it (varicella zoster virus). If you are not protected against the 
virus, you may need a vaccination before you start treatment with Gilenya. If this is the case, your 
doctor will delay the start of treatment with Gilenya until one month after the full course of 
vaccination is completed. 
Infections: Gilenya lowers the white blood cell count (particularly the lymphocyte count). White 
blood cells fight infection. While you are taking Gilenya (and for up to 2 months after you stop taking 
it), you may get infections more easily. Any infection that you already have may get worse. Infections 
could be serious and life-threatening. If you think you have an infection, have fever, feel like you have 
the flu, or have a headache accompanied by stiff neck, sensitivity to light, nausea, and/or confusion 
(these may be symptoms of meningitis), contact your doctor right away. If you believe your MS is 
getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if you notice any new symptoms, talk to your 
doctor as soon as possible, because these may be the symptoms of a rare brain disorder caused by 
infection and called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a serious condition 
that may lead to severe disability or death. 
Macular oedema: Before you start Gilenya, if you have or have had visual disturbances or other 
signs of swelling in the central vision area (macula) at the back of the eye, inflammation or infection 
of the eye (uveitis) or diabetes, your doctor may want you to undergo an eye examination. 
Your doctor may want you to undergo an eye examination 3 to 4 months after starting Gilenya 
treatment. 
The macula is a small area of the retina at the back of the eye which enables you to see shapes, 
colours, and details clearly and sharply. Gilenya may cause swelling in the macula, a condition that is 
known as macular oedema. The swelling usually happens in the first 4 months of Gilenya treatment. 
Your chance of developing macular oedema is higher if you have diabetes or have had an 
inflammation of the eye called uveitis. In these cases your doctor will want you to undergo regular eye 
examinations in order to detect macular oedema. 
If you have had macular oedema, talk to your doctor before you resume treatment with Gilenya. 
Macular oedema can cause some of the same vision symptoms as an MS attack (optic neuritis). Early 
on, there may not be any symptoms. Be sure to tell your doctor about any changes in your vision. 
Your doctor may want you to undergo an eye examination, especially if: 
- 
- 
the centre of your vision gets blurry or has shadows; 
you develop a blind spot in the centre of your vision; 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
you have problems seeing colours or fine detail. 
Liver function tests: If you have severe liver problems, you should not take Gilenya. Gilenya may 
affect your liver function. You will probably not notice any symptoms but if you notice yellowing of 
your skin or the whites of your eyes, abnormally dark urine or unexplained nausea and vomiting, tell 
your doctor straight away. 
If you get any of these symptoms after starting Gilenya, tell your doctor straight away. 
During the first twelve months of treatment your doctor will request blood tests to monitor your liver 
function. If your test results indicate a problem with your liver you may have to interrupt treatment 
with Gilenya. 
High blood pressure 
As Gilenya causes a slight elevation of blood pressure, your doctor may want to check your blood 
pressure regularly. 
Lung problems 
Gilenya has a slight effect on the lung function. Patients with severe lung problems or with smoker’s 
cough may have a higher chance of developing side effects. 
Blood count 
The desired effect of Gilenya treatment is to reduce the amount of white blood cells in your blood. 
This will usually go back to normal within 2 months of stopping treatment. If you need to have any 
blood tests, tell the doctor that you are taking Gilenya. Otherwise, it may not be possible for the 
doctor to understand the results of the test, and for certain types of blood test your doctor may need to 
take more blood than usual. 
Before you start Gilenya, your doctor will confirm whether you have enough white blood cells in your 
blood and may want to repeat a check regularly. In case you do not have enough white blood cells, 
you may have to interrupt treatment with Gilenya. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
A condition called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been rarely reported in 
MS patients treated with Gilenya. Symptoms may include sudden onset of severe headache, 
confusion, seizures and vision changes. Tell your doctor, if you experience any of these symptoms 
during your treatment with Gilenya. 
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 
A type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been reported in MS patients treated with 
Gilenya. Talk to your doctor if you notice any skin nodules (e.g. shiny pearly nodules), patches or 
open sores that do not heal within weeks (these may be signs of BCC). Before you start Gilenya, a 
skin examination is required to check whether you have any skin nodules. Your doctor will also carry 
out regular skin examinations during your treatment with Gilenya. If you develop problems with your 
skin, your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, who after consultation may decide that it is 
important for you to be seen on a regular basis. 
Elderly 
Experience with Gilenya in elderly patients (over 65 years) is limited. Talk to your doctor if you have 
any concerns. 
Children and adolescents 
Gilenya is not intended to be used in children and adolescents below 18 years old as it has not been 
studied in MS patients below 18 years old. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Gilenya 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
•  Medicines that suppress or modulate the immune system, including other medicines used 
to treat MS, such as beta interferon, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, 
teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate or alemtuzumab. You must not use Gilenya together with 
such medicines as this could intensify the effect on the immune system (see also ‘Do not take 
Gilenya’). 
Corticosteroids, due to a possible added effect on the immune system. 
Vaccines. If you need to receive a vaccine, seek your doctor’s advice first. During and for up to 
2 months after treatment with Gilenya, you should not receive certain types of vaccine (live 
attenuated vaccines) as they could trigger the infection that they were supposed to prevent. 
Other vaccines may not work as well as usual if given during this period. 
• 
• 
•  Medicines that slow the heartbeat (for example beta blockers, such as atenolol). Use of 
Gilenya together with such medicines could intensify the effect on heartbeat in the first days 
after starting Gilenya. 
• 
•  Medicines for irregular heartbeat, such as quinidine, disopyramide, amiodarone or sotalol. 
Your doctor may decide not to prescribe Gilenya if you are taking such a medicine because it 
could intensify the effect on irregular heartbeat. 
Other medicines: 
o 
protease inhibitors, anti-infectives such as ketoconazole, azole antifungals, 
clarithromycin or telithromycin. 
carbamazepine, rifampicine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, efavirenz or St. John’s Wort 
(potential risk of reduced efficacy). 
o 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Before you start treatment with Gilenya your doctor may ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to 
ensure that you are not pregnant. You should avoid becoming pregnant while taking Gilenya or in the 
two months after you stop taking it because there is a risk of harm to the baby. Talk with your doctor 
about reliable methods of birth control that you should use during treatment and for 2 months after 
you stop treatment. 
If you do become pregnant while taking Gilenya, stop taking the medicine and tell your doctor 
straight away. You and your doctor will decide what is best for you and your baby. 
You should not breast-feed while you are taking Gilenya. Gilenya can pass into breast milk and 
there is a risk of serious side effects for the baby. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
Gilenya is not expected to have an influence on your ability to drive and use machines. 
However, at initiation of treatment you will have to stay at the doctor’s surgery or clinic for 6 hours 
after taking the first dose of Gilenya. Your ability to drive and use machines may be impaired during 
and potentially after this time period. 
3. 
How to take Gilenya 
Treatment with Gilenya will be overseen by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of multiple 
sclerosis. 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sure. 
The dose is one capsule per day. Take Gilenya once a day with a glass of water. Gilenya can be 
taken with or without food. 
Taking Gilenya at the same time each day will help you remember when to take your medicine. 
Do not exceed the recommended dose. 
Your doctor may switch you directly from beta interferon, glatiramer acetate or dimethyl fumarate to 
Gilenya if there are no signs of abnormalities caused by your previous treatment. Your doctor may 
have to do a blood test in order to exclude such abnormalities. After stopping natalizumab you may 
have to wait for 2-3 months before starting treatment with Gilenya. To switch from teriflunomide, 
your doctor may advise you to wait for a certain time or to go through an accelerated elimination 
procedure. If you have been treated with alemtuzumab, a thorough evaluation and discussion with 
your doctor is required to decide if Gilenya is appropriate for you. 
If you have questions about how long to take Gilenya, talk to your doctor or your pharmacist. 
If you take more Gilenya than you should 
If you have taken too much Gilenya, call your doctor straight away. 
If you forget to take Gilenya 
If you have been taking Gilenya for less than 1 month and you forget to take 1 dose for a whole day, 
call your doctor before you take the next dose. Your doctor may decide to keep you under observation 
at the time you take the next dose. 
If you have been taking Gilenya for at least 1 month and have forgotten to take your treatment for 
more than 2 weeks, call your doctor before you take the next dose. Your doctor may decide to keep 
you under observation at the time you take the next dose. However, if you have forgotten to take your 
treatment for up to 2 weeks, you can take the next dose as planned. 
Never take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Gilenya 
Do not stop taking Gilenya or change your dose without talking to your doctor first. 
Gilenya will stay in your body for up to 2 months after you stop taking it. Your white blood cell count 
(lymphocyte count) may also remain low during this time and the side effects described in this leaflet 
may still occur. After stopping Gilenya you may have to wait for 6-8 weeks before starting a new MS 
treatment. 
If you have to restart Gilenya more than 2 weeks after you stop taking it, the effect on heart rate 
normally seen when treatment is first started may re-occur and you will need to be monitored at the 
doctor’s surgery or clinic for re-initiation of treatment. Do not restart Gilenya after stopping it for 
more than two weeks without seeking advice from your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

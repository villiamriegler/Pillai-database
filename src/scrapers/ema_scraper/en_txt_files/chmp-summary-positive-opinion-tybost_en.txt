Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Tybost 
cobicistat 
On 25 July 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Tybost, 
150 mg, Film-coated tablet intended for use as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of the human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors atazanavir and darunavir in adults. The applicant 
for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences International Ltd. They may request a re-examination of 
any CHMP opinion, provided they notify the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention 
within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The active substance of Tybost is cobicistat, a PK enhancer (V03AX03) and is a selective, mechanism-
based inhibitor of cytochromes P450 of the CYP3A subfamily.  
The benefits with Tybost are its ability to inhibit CYP3A-mediated metabolism and to enhance the 
systemic exposure of CYP3A substrates (such as atazanavir or darunavir) that have limited oral 
bioavailability and a short half-life due to CYP3A-dependent metabolism. The most common side 
effects with cobicistat-boosted atazanavir are associated with elevated bilirubin levels. 
A pharmacovigilance plan for Tybost will be implemented as part of the marketing authorisation.  
The approved indication is: "Tybost is indicated as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of atazanavir 300 mg 
once daily or darunavir 800 mg once daily as part of antiretroviral combination therapy in human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected adults". It is proposed that Tybost be prescribed by 
physicians experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
67 days from adoption of the opinion.

The CHMP, on the basis of quality, safety and efficacy data submitted, considers there to be a 
favourable benefit-to-risk balance for Tybost and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing 
authorisation.

1.  Introduction 
The  Clinical  Overview  of  this  Article  46  submission  summarizes  the  long-term  safety  results  for 
etravirine  (ETR)  in  Study  TMC125-TiDP35-C239,  a  roll-over  study  from  previous  studies  (TMC125-
C206,  TMC125-C216,  TMC125-C217,  TMC125-C213  and  TMC125-C234).  The  main  objective  of  this 
study TMC125-TiDP35-C239 was to continue the provision of ETR for adult and paediatric subjects who 
previously received ETR in a clinical study in countries where ETR was not available. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Study TMC125-TiDP35-C239 is not part of a Paediatric Investigation Plan. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Three tablet formulations are registered in EU, which can be either swallowed whole or dispersed: 
- A scored 25-mg tablet (F066). 
- A 100-mg tablet (F060). 
- A 200-mg tablet (F068). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In  the  European  Union  (EU),  INTELENCE,  in  combination  with  a  boosted  protease  inhibitor  (PI)  and 
other  antiretroviral  (ARV)  medicinal  products, 
is 
indicated 
for 
the 
treatment  of  human 
immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  infection  in  antiretroviral  therapy  (ART)-experienced  adult  patients  and 
in  antiretroviral  therapy  (ART)-experienced  paediatric  patients  beginning  at  2  years  of  age.  The 
recommended dose of ETR for paediatric patients aged ≥2 years to <18 years and weighing ≥10 kg is 
based on body weight: 
The recommended oral dosage of ETR for adult patients is 200 mg (one 200 mg tablet or two 100 mg 
tablets) taken twice daily following a meal.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study TMC125-TiDP35-C239 
Methods 
Objectives 
The main objective of this study was to continue the provision of ETR for adult and paediatric subjects 
who previously received ETR in a clinical study sponsored by JRD, and who continued to benefit from 
the use of ETR, in countries where ETR was not commercially available for the subject’s indication, was 
not  reimbursed,  and  could  not  be  accessed  through  another  source  (e.g.  access  program  or 
government program), or where the subject was not eligible for ongoing studies/programs with ETR. 
Study design 
This  is  a  roll-over  study  from  previous  studies  (TMC125-C206,  TMC125-C216  [in  adults],  TMC125-
C217, TMC125-C213 [in subjects aged 6 to <18 years], and subsequently TMC125-C234 [in subjects 
aged ≥2 to ≤6 years]) which started in December 2009 and collected long-term safety information on 
ETR. No efficacy data were collected. 
At the Baseline visit, subjects were either continued on the ETR dose they had received in the previous 
ETR  study,  or  on  an  adjusted  dose  if  deemed  necessary  by  the  investigator.  For  paediatric  subjects, 
ETR dose adjustment was based on weight, in accordance to the recommended paediatric doses (see 
table above). Assessment visits were recommended according to local generally accepted standard of 
care, but not less frequent than every 3 and 6 months for paediatric and adult subjects, respectively. 
Treatment will be continued until one of the following criteria are met: the investigator determines that 
the  subject  no  longer  benefits  from  ETR  treatment  (e.g.  based  on  viral  load);  treatment  limiting 
toxicity;  lost  to  follow-up;  subject  withdrawal  of  consent;  pregnancy;  termination  of  the  program  by 
the Sponsor; ETR becomes commercially available for the subject’s indication, is reimbursed, or can be 
accessed through another source (e.g. access program, government program) in the region the subject 
is living in, whichever occurs first. 
This  final  CSR  contains  data  collected  up  to  the  implementation  of  amendment  CTPA-GEN-III  (eg, 
subjects leaving CTPA-GEN-II and entering CTPA-GEN-III). The purpose of this amendment CTPA-GEN-
III  was  to  simplify  the  follow  up  of  participants  and  to  incorporate  the  following  changes:  Subjects 
aged  2  years  and  older  were  allowed  to  roll-over  from  previous  Study  TMC125-C234;  and  dosing 
instructions were added to provide weight-based dosing for paediatric subjects. Therefore, the study is 
still ongoing under protocol amendment CTPA-GEN-III, but no data are being collected at present.  
Study population/Sample size 
Subjects (adults and children ≥2 years old) who completed treatment in a clinical study with ETR, and 
continued to benefit from the use of ETR, were eligible to continue ETR through this study. There was 
no targeted study sample size. 
Treatments 
Study treatment is defined as ETR 25 mg and 100 mg tablets. ETR will be dosed orally according to the 
dosing table:

Adult subjects received a dose of ETR 200 mg BID. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
There were no primary and secondary endpoints. 
Safety and toxicity monitoring were performed throughout the study as per local standard of care. 
Safety was evaluated based on: 
- Adverse events/HIV-related events summarized in terms of: 
•  Mortality 
•  All SAEs 
•  AEs leading to discontinuation 
•  AEs possible related to ETR 
- Urine pregnancy test 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 180 subjects were enrolled in this study (71 paediatric subjects and 109 adult subjects). All 
subjects  were  discontinued  from  study  (excepted  one  paediatric  subject  who  did  not  complete  the 
study due to unknown reasons) mainly for switch to commercially available medication, withdrawal of 
consent  and  lost  to  follow-up.  One  third  of  patients  have  switch  to  CTPA-GEN-III  amendment  and 
therefore  have  continued  ETR  treatment  within  this  study.  Of  note,  data  from  CTPA-GEN-III 
amendment are not available.

Baseline Characteristics 
Patients  were  distributed  across  5  regions  (Europe,  North  America,  Latin  America,  Asia-Pacific,  and 
Africa). 
- Subjects in the adult population were distributed across 2 regions: Africa 105 subjects (96.3%) and 4 
(3.7%) from Latin America. 
-  The  71  paediatric  subjects  were  distributed  across  the  5  regions  as  follows:  19  (26.8%)  from  Latin 
America,  17  (23.9%)  from  Africa,  17  from  Europe  (23.9%),  12  (16.9%)  from  Asia-Pacific,  and  6 
(8.5%) from North America. 
There was a higher percentage of females than males in both paediatric and adult subjects.

Antiretrovirals  in  the  initial  OBR  included  PIs,  NRTIs,  NNRTIs,  and  the  integrase  inhibitor  raltegravir. 
The most frequently used PIs were ritonavir (169 subjects [93.9%]), lopinavir (103 subjects [57.2%]), 
and  darunavir  (40  subjects  [22.2%]).  The  most  frequently  used  NRTIs  were  tenofovir  (81  subjects 
[45%]),  lamivudine  (45  subjects  [25%]),  and  zidovudine  (38  subjects  [21.1%]).  Integrase  inhibitor 
raltegravir  and  NNRTI  efavirenz  were  only  used  by  6  subjects  (3.3%)  and  4  subjects  (2.2%), 
respectively.  Most  subjects  were  treated  with  a  PI  combination  (lopinavir  +  ritonavir,  31  subjects 
[17.2%]),  or  with  PI  and  NRTI  combinations  (lopinavir  +  ritonavir  +  tenofovir,  27  subjects  [15%]; 
lopinavir + ritonavir + stavudine, 10 subjects [5.6%]). Other combinations were used in <4% of the 
subject population.

least one fatal AE (see below). Twelve subjects (6.7%) reported at least one worst Grade 3 or 4 AE, of 
which all were adults, and 18 subjects (10%) reported at least one SAE. 
Common Adverse Events 
The most common AEs were reported in the SOC of Infections and infestations (19 [10.6%]), of which, 
the majority were reported in paediatric subjects (13 [18.3%]) and 6 (5.5%) were reported in adults. 
Upper respiratory tract infections (5 subjects [2.8%]) and tonsillitis (4 subjects [2.2%]) were the most 
commonly reported infections. 
Adverse events in the SOC of Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were the second most commonly 
reported (9 subjects [5%]); reports were evenly distributed among paediatric (4 subjects [5.6%]) and 
adult (5 [4.6%]) subjects. Preferred term Rash was the most commonly reported AE (4 subjects 
[2.2%]), with all reports occurring in adult subjects. 
Drug-related Adverse Events 
Out of 180 subjects, 5 subjects (2.8%) reported AEs that were at least possibly related to ETR:

A 17-year-old male subject experienced lipase increased of grade 2 severity on Day 249, considered as 
possibly  related  to  ETR.  No  adjustment  in  dose  or  ETR  discontinuation  have  been  done.  The  AE 
resolved after 113 days. 
A  34-year-old  female  patient  experienced  hepatic  enzyme  increased  of  grade  3  severity  on  Day  506, 
considered as possibly related to ETR. ETR was permanently discontinued. The AE recovered after 21 
days. 
A  34-year-old  female  patient  experienced  rash  of  grade  1  severity  on  Day  86  assessed  as  possibly 
related to ETR. The dose of ETR was not changed and the AE resolved. 
A 41-year-old female experienced neuropathy peripheral on Day 1048 of grade 1 severity considered 
as possibly related to ETR. The AE resolved. The dose was not changed. 
A 66-year-old male patient was reported with lipoatrophy of grade 2 severity on Day 534 considered as 
probably related to ETR. The dose of ETR was not changed and the outcome was not resolved.  
Adverse Events Leading to Drug Discontinuation 
Overall,  12  (6.7%)  out  of  180  subjects  reported  at  least  1  AE  that  lead  to  drug  discontinuation,  the 
majority  of  events  were  reported  in  adult  subjects  (n=11).  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation  of  study  medication  were  reported  in  the  SOC  Pregnancy,  puerperium  and  perinatal 
conditions, PT Pregnancy, with 1 case (1.4%) reported in a paediatric subject, and 3 (2.8%) reported 
in  adults.  The  other  PTs  reported  were  :  death  (2  subjects),  myocardial  infarction,  disseminated 
tuberculosis,  sepsis,  brain  herniation,  hepatic  enzyme  increased,  acute  kidney  injury,  rash, 
hyponatremia,  hypovolemia,  CNS  metastases,  lymph  nodes  metastases  and  depression  (1  subject 
each). 
Deaths and Serious Adverse Events 
There  were  6  deaths  reported  in  this  study.  There  have  been  one  accidental  death,  one  sudden 
unexplained death (a 63-year-old female with history of HTA, cardiac failure, asthma, diabetes found in 
her  bed  in  the  morning),  one  death  secondary  to  epithelial  carcinoma  with  cerebral  metastases,  one 
patient with depression committed suicide (patient with history of chronic depression, panic attack and

insomnia), one death was attributed to myocardial infarction and the last one was attributed to acute 
kidney  injury,  sepsis,  hyponatremia  and  disseminated  tuberculosis.  None  of  these  fatal  cases  were 
considered as related to ETR.  
A total of 18 subjects (10%) reported at least one SAE with the majority reported in adults 13 (11.9%) 
and 5 (7%) reported in the paediatric population: 
No SAEs that were at least possibly related to ETR were reported either in paediatric or adult subjects.

A total of 8 subjects (4.4%) reported AEs of special interest. The majority of subjects were adult (7 
[6.4%]) and only 1 was paediatric. Events of interest skin events were the most frequently reported 
AEs. 
Other Safety Observations 
A  progressive  and  gradual  increase  in  mean  weight  from  40.86  kg  at  baseline  to  67.90  kg  at  Month 
105 was observed in paediatric subjects. Such an increase, however, is confounded by the normal gain 
in  body  weight in paediatric  participants  due to normal  growth.  The  mean  change in  weight  for  adult 
participants was from 70.70 kg at baseline to 77.63 kg at Month 84. 
Overall, the MAH considers that the safety data collected in this study was consistent with the known 
safety profile of etravirine. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  main  objective  of  this  observational  study  was  to  continue  the  provision  of  ETR  for  adult  and 
paediatric subjects who previously received ETR in a clinical study. No efficacy data were recorded, no 
formal  safety  monitoring  was  imposed,  but  safety  data  have  been  collected  among  180  patients 
receiving  ETR  among  other  antiretroviral  drugs  throughout  the  reporting  of  AEs  by  the  investigators. 
The  final  report  shows  that  the  study  TMC125-TiDP35-C239  included  71  paediatric  subjects  with  age 
ranking  from  4  to  17  years  and  109  adult  subjects.  Most  subjects  included  in  this  study  have  been 
treated as recommended with ETR co-administered with a boosted PI (94%) and another ARV (≈80%, 
mainly a NRTI).  
The most common reason for ETR discontinuation in this study has been the switch to another protocol 
for  the  study  (around  one  third),  the  switch  to  commercially  available  medication  (13.9%)  and  the 
withdrawal of consent (24%). Only 12 subjects discontinued due to AE/HIV-related events (11 adults 
and  1  child).  The  most  frequent  AE  leading  to  ETR  discontinuation  has  been  the  occurrence  of 
pregnancy  (4  cases).  The  5  AEs  considered  as  related  to  ETR  are  already  listed  in  the  ETR  SmPC  as 
common (lipase increase, peripheral neuropathy, hepatic enzyme increase) or very common (rash). All 
but  one  resolved  and  the  recovery  was  reported  despite  ETR  continuation  in  3  out  4  cases  and  after 
ETR discontinuation in one case. The  AESI reported are mostly skin AEs (rash). The other AESI have 
been reported only once and in adult subjects.

Of note, there was no SAE considered related to ETR. The 6 fatal cases have been considered as not 
related to ETR and this is endorsed following the review of the cases.  
Regarding data provided on weight, an increase in mean weight has been observed in paediatric 
subjects and adults. However, as highlighted by the MAH, the analysis is confounded by the normal 
growth of paediatric subjects and the increasing limited number of subjects with weight data available 
visits after visit. At month 105, weight is available only for 1 subject. Therefore, it is considered that 
no conclusion can be drawn from these data on the weight increase. 
In conclusion, the MAH’s conclusion stating that the safety data collected during this study are 
consistent with the known safety profile of ETR and that no new safety signal has been highlighted 
notably in paediatric patients can be endorsed. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

1.  Introduction 
On 21th February 2017, the MAH submitted the report of a completed BeneFIX (Nonacog Alfa, 
Recombinant Factor IX) clinical study (B1821052) including data from paediatric subjects, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended. A clinical overview has 
been provided. The post-authorisation clinical trial assessed safety and efficacy of BeneFIX in subjects 
with hemophilia B in usual care settings and was conducted in China as a commitment to the China 
Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). The clinical study report (CSR) has been prepared in English 
using the required CFDA template which differs from ICH E3 in the organisation of the appendices 
which was considered acceptable by the EMA on 23 September 2016. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study B1821052 is a stand-alone study. BeneFIX is indicated in China for the 
control and prevention of bleeding episodes in adult and paediatric subjects with hemophilia B 
(congenital FIX deficiency or Christmas disease), and is indicated for peri-operative management in 
adult and paediatric subjects with hemophilia B. This study is a postmarketing commitment in China 
and was conducted to provide supplementary information relating to the use of BeneFIX in a real world 
clinical setting in Chinese subjects with hemophilia B. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
BeneFIX® (nonacog alfa) is a recombinant, single chain glycoprotein therapeutic that has structural 
and functional characteristics comparable to endogenous coagulation factor IX (FIX). BeneFIX is 
supplied as a powder for reconstitution and intravenous injection. Each single-use vial contains 
nominally 250, 500, 1000, 2000, or 3000 international units (IU). 
BeneFIX first received regulatory approval on 11 February 1997 in the United States (US). Later, it was 
reformulated to decrease the occurrence of red blood cell agglutination in the syringe or tubing. 
Reformulated nonacog alfa was approved for use in the European Union (EU) and US in 2007 and since 
January 2009 only the reformulated version of nonacog alfa is being distributed worldwide. BeneFIX is 
now approved in 66 countries and marketed in 46 countries. For supporting licensure in China, the 
registration trial was conducted in 2008. BeneFIX received regulatory approval on 10 July 2012 in 
China. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report and clinical overview including data of pediatric subjects with 
hemophilia B from a trial assessing safety and efficacy of BeneFIX in usual care settings in China 
(study B1821052). The trial was a post-authorisation pragmatic study conducted in 17 investigational 
sites and enrolled 70 patients. 61 pediatric subjects (≤12 years of age) with hemophilia B were 
included, 11 of these were previously untreated patients. Haemophilia B is a X-linked recessive 
bleeding disorder caused by mutations of the F9 gene leading to a partial or total deficiency of 
functionally active coagulation factor IX. The disease affects approximately 1 in 30,000 males

worldwide. Women, who carry a single mutated gene, are generally asymptomatic. The disease 
phenotype correlates with the residual activity of FIX and is characterised by bleeding into joints, soft 
tissues, muscles or internal organs, either after accidental or surgery trauma or spontaneously. The 
treatment of choice for hemophilia B is FIX replacement therapy. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study  
Study B1821052 - An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Post-Authorization Pragmatic Clinical Trial on the Safety 
and Efficacy of BeneFIX (Nonacog Alfa, Recombinant Factor IX) in Subjects with Hemophilia B in Usual 
Care Settings in China.  
Description 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the occurrence and severity of product medically 
important events (i.e. FIX inhibitor development, allergic reactions, and thrombotic events) of BeneFIX 
in subjects with hemophilia B in usual care settings in China. 
Secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the overall safety of BeneFIX, including the 
occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), and to evaluate the efficacy of 
BeneFIX in subjects with hemophilia B in usual care settings in China. 
The exploratory objective of the study was to evaluate patient reported outcome in pediatric subjects. 
Study design 
This was an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, prospective post-authorization pragmatic study 
conducted in 17 (1 site did not enrol any subjects) hemophilia treatment centers in China, as 
requested by the CFDA. The study objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BeneFIX in 
subjects <6 years of age, ≥6 to ≤12 years of age, previously untreated patients (PUPs), severe 
hemophilia patients (FIX activity <1%), and patients receiving prophylaxis treatment after enrollment 
in the study. A target of 30 subjects for each of these subgroups was to be enrolled to fulfil the China 
Center of Drug Evaluation (CDE) requirements. Subjects were treated by the investigator according to 
usual care in China and in accordance with the China BeneFIX Package Insert. The treatment duration 
was approximately 6 months or 50 exposure days (EDs). The study is completed and the last subject’s 
last visit for this study was on 22 August 2016. 
Study population /Sample size 
Male and/or female subjects with hemophilia B, who or whose parents/legal representatives were able 
to comply with study procedures were eligible to participate in the study. 
Subjects with presence of any of the following were ineligible to participate in this study: other 
bleeding disorder(s) in addition to hemophilia B, a past history of, or current FIX inhibitor, a known 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of BeneFIX, and/or a known 
hypersensitivity to Chinese Hamster Ovary cell proteins. 
According to the requirements of the CDE, 30 subjects of each of the aforementioned subgroups (see 
study design) were planned to enrol resulting in a total of 60 planned subjects due to overlap among 
the subgroups. Finally, 70 subjects were enrolled and treated with intravenous infusions of BeneFIX.

Treatments 
The treatment modality was decided by the investigators according to the China BeneFIX package 
insert and doses were adjusted solely according to medical and therapeutic necessity. Patients were 
treated for approximately 6 months (±7 days) or 50 ± 5 EDs (whichever occurred first). 
According to the clinical overview provided in section 2.5 of the eCTD, the mean (±SD) average 
infusion doses by weight were 23.5 (±8.7), 24.5 (±8.9), and 39.1 (±12.2) IU/kg in the on-demand, 
prophylaxis, and the preventative and recovery settings, respectively. Subjects had a mean number of 
35.6 (prophylaxis), 11.1 (on-demand), and 1.6 (preventative and recovery) exposure days with similar 
numbers of infusions per subject. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety Endpoints:  
The primary safety endpoints to be reported were development of FIX inhibitor, allergic reactions and 
thrombotic events. Secondary safety outcomes included the frequency of AEs and SAEs. All the 
primary safety endpoints were considered medically important events and reported as SAEs. 
Efficacy Endpoints: 
All efficacy endpoints were secondary endpoints in this study, which included: 
Prophylaxis treatment: 
o  Annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) in subjects who received prophylaxis treatment with BeneFIX 
during their prophylaxis period; 
o  Number of spontaneous/non-traumatic breakthrough bleeds within 48 hours of a prophylaxis 
dose of BeneFIX; 
On-demand treatment: 
o  ABRs in subjects who received on-demand treatment with BeneFIX during their on-demand 
period; 
o  The response to on-demand treatment with BeneFIX for all bleeds (4-point scale of 
assessment, one per infusion); 
o  Number of BeneFIX infusions to treat each new bleed; 
Prophylaxis treatment, on-demand treatment, and recovery settings: 
o  The average infusion dose and total FIX consumption; 
o  The incidence of less than expected therapeutic effect (LETE) in the on-demand, prophylaxis, 
and low recovery (when available) settings. 
Statistical Methods 
The study was an open-label, single-arm post-authorization pragmatic study, with no statistical 
hypotheses to be tested. The results of the study were presented using descriptive statistics.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 70 subjects were enrolled to study B1821052 and received at least 1 dose of BeneFIX. All 
these subjects were included in the full analysis set and in the safety analysis set (n=70 for both). 
Finally, a total of 57 patients received prophylaxis treatment and 18 subjects on-demand treatment. 
However, for calculation of FIX consumption, a total of 46 subjects were included in the on-demand 
analysis set with an overlap with the prophylaxis analysis set. Laboratory data were analysed from 68 
patients.  
Baseline data 
From 70 enrolled and treated patients (all Asian and male), 66 patients completed the clinical trial. 4 
subjects discontinued early. Of these, 1 subject withdrew due to lost to follow-up, 1 subject withdrew 
due to no longer willing to participate in the study, 1 subject withdrew due to protocol violation, and 1 
subject withdrew due to other reasons (quit for family reasons).  
For secondary endpoints, data of the 5 subgroups (see study design) are reported. However, the MAH 
stated that due to the challenges in recruiting PUP subjects, a total of 11 PUP subjects were enrolled 
and this subgroup did not reach the planned sample size (i.e. a total of 30 PUPs according to the 
requirements of the CDE). Thus, for FIX inhibitor analysis (the primary endpoint), data of 
“PUP+minimally treated patient (MTP, defined as subjects with previous EDs ≥1 and ≤50)” was 
additionally reported to complement the PUP subgroup. In summary, the following numbers of subjects 
were allocated to the respective subgroup: <6 years (n=30), ≥6 to ≤12 years (n=31), PUPs (n=11), 
MTP (n=27), PUP + MTP (n=38), subjects with severe hemophilia B (n=36), prophylaxis subjects 
(n=57). The mean body mass index of the study population was 17.3 kg/m2 with a range of 12.4-27.7.  
Efficacy results 
In prophylaxis regimen, the 57 subjects treated with BeneFIX had a mean ABR of 6.5 (median: 2.0, 
range 0.0-34.8). There were no relevant variations between the 5 subgroups, however, PUPs in the 
prophylactic treatment regimen (n=7) had a mean ABR of 0.3 (range of 0.0-1.9). The number of 
spontaneous/non-traumatic breakthrough bleeds within 48 hours of a prophylaxis dose of BeneFIX was 
23 per total of 2032 prophylactic infusions occurring in 11 subjects. No variations between the 
subgroups have been observed. A total of 2 LETEs (i.e. spontaneous bleed within 48 hours after a 
regularly scheduled prophylactic dose) were observed in 2 pediatric patients in the prophylaxis setting 
(incidence of 0.1%). 
In the on-demand setting, a total of 18 subjects had a mean ABR of 26.3 (median: 15.9, range 0.0-
73.8). Average ABRs were highest for pediatric subgroup ≥6 to ≤12 years (n=6, mean ABR: 28.2) and 
subjects with severe hemophilia (n=10, mean ABR: 29.3) and lowest for PUPs (n=4, mean ABR: 6.2). 
Bleeding events occurred in 65% of all subjects (i.e. 46/70). The mean number of BeneFIX infusions to 
treat each new bleed was 1.5 and most bleeds resolved with 1 infusion. The majority of responses to 
on-demand infusions were rated excellent or good in all subgroups (overall 88% for all infusions). No 
LETEs were confirmed in the on-demand setting (i.e. if 2 successive “No Response” ratings were 
recorded after 2 successive infusions, respectively). 
The mean average infusion doses by weight were 23.5 (±8.7), 24.5 (±8.9), and 39.1 (±12.2) IU/kg in 
the on-demand, prophylaxis, and the preventative and recovery settings, respectively. The total mean 
FIX consumption per subject was 19224.1 (±15424.7), 9826.1 (±14816.3), and 1419.8 (±1192.6) IU

in the prophylaxis, on-demand, and the preventative and recovery settings, respectively. The mean 
numbers of exposure days (EDs) and number of infusions per subject were 35.6 and 35.6 for subjects 
in the prophylaxis setting and 11.1 and 11.3 for subjects in on-demand setting. 
Safety results 
Of 202 reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), 3 TEAEs in 2 subjects were considered as 
treatment related (1xSAE and 2xAEs). One subject out of 70 subjects included in the safety analysis 
set experienced cough and rash, both events resolved and were rated mild in severity. The other 
patient developed a FIX inhibitor without clinical manifestation, i.e. a transient low-titer inhibitor (0.71 
BU/mL) after discontinuation of prophylactic treatment (due to unwillingness to continue). The patient 
had received BeneFIX for a total of 25 EDs. On retesting one month after inhibitor detection, a 
negative result was obtained and the SAE was considered resolved. Thus, the overall observed inhibitor 
rate was 1.4%. No high-titer inhibitors, allergic reactions or thrombotic events occurred during the 
study. No deaths occurred during the study and no clinically important findings for laboratory safety or 
vital signs have been identified. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, the MAH submitted the final report of 
a phase IV pragmatic trial designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of BeneFIX in Chinese subjects with 
hemophilia B in real-life routine practice setting. Of 70 enrolled and treated subjects, 61 were pediatric 
including 11 previously untreated and 27 minimally treated patients. The study results demonstrated 
that BeneFIX was efficacious in the treatment of hemophilia B in the Chinese population when used for 
prophylaxis as well as for on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes. With regard to age-staggered 
pediatric subgroups and FIX dosing, average infusion doses were slightly higher in the younger 
population (27.9 IU/kg in on-demand setting and  26.7 IU/kg in prophylaxis regimen) as compared to 
the older pediatric subjects (i.e. 22.4 and 20.6 IU/kg, respectively), however, total FIX consumption 
was higher in the older population (i.e. 6550 and 22102 IU in the on-demand and prophylaxis regimen, 
respectively) when compared to pediatric subjects <6 years of age (i.e. 4277 and 14709 IU, 
respectively). No specific data outlining dosing intervals in the prophylaxis setting have been provided. 
However, based on the mean numbers of EDs for the prophylaxis setting of 35.6 within a period of 6 
month, dose intervals of approximately 5 days can be assumed. This is less frequently when compared 
to the approved EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC), where for routine secondary 
prophylaxis an average dose for previously treated patients of 40 IU/kg (range 13 to 78 IU/kg) at 
intervals of 3 to 4 days was outlined. In the Chinese trial subjects, ABRs did not show relevant 
differences with regard to age-graded pediatric subgroups. PUPs (n=7) had lower mean ABRs, i.e. 0.3 
versus 6.7 for all pediatric subjects (n=55) in the prophylaxis setting, and lower FIX consumption. 
However, average infusion doses by weight were similar (i.e. 22.0 IU/kg for PUPs in the prophylaxis 
setting compared to 23.6 IU/kg for all pediatric patients). Taking differences in the treatment modality 
of Chinese subjects and subgroup sizes into account, provided data on FIX dosage are considered to be 
largely consistent with recommendations made in the EU SmPC and no regulatory consequences have 
been identified.  
Regarding safety aspects of BeneFIX, three treatment emergent adverse events were reported 
including one case of transient low-titer FIX inhibitor and one patient who experienced mild cough and 
mild rash. All of these events resolved. No thrombotic or allergic events occurred during the study. 
Thus, no safety concerns arise and provided safety data do not have an impact on the EU SmPC.

Overall, safety and efficacy data of subjects from the phase IV trial do not change the favourable 
benefit risk profile of BeneFIX for use in pediatric patients. Provided data are not considered to have 
any impact on the BeneFIX EU SmPC. 
3.  apporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In summary, data reported from study B1821052 confirm efficacy and safety of prophylactic and on-
demand use of BeneFIX in Asian pediatric patients with hemophilia B. The benefit risk profile remains 
favourable and study data do not have any impact on the current EU SmPC of BeneFIX. No regulatory 
action required. No additional clarification requested.

Proposed therapeutic indication 
Libmeldy is indicated for the treatment of 
metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) characterized 
by biallelic mutations in the arysulfatase A (ARSA) 
gene leading to a reduction of the ARSA enzymatic 
activity: 
-in children with late infantile or early juvenile forms, 
without clinical manifestations of the disease, 
-in children with the early juvenile form, with early 
clinical manifestations of the disease, who still have 
the ability to walk independently and before the onset 
of cognitive decline

procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2007 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
for the purpose of orphan designation, the COMP considered that the active ingredient should be 
reworded as “autologous CD34+ cells transfected with lentiviral vector containing the human 
arylsulfatase A cDNA”; 
•  metachromatic leukodystrophy (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be 
affecting less than 0.5 in 10,000 persons in the Community, at the time the application was made; 
• 
• 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening in particular due to the development of 
progressive degenerative disease and short life expectancy; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the Community for 
patients affected by the condition.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Metachromatic leukodystrophy (also known as arylsulfatase A deficiency) is an autosomal recessively 
inherited disease characterized by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A. Its 
deficiency results in accumulation of sulfatides in neural and visceral tissues, and causes demyelination 
of the central and peripheral nervous system (Beerepoot, Orphanet J Rare Dis 2019 Nov 4;14(1):240). 
This leads to a broad range of neurological symptoms with three clinical subtypes: late-infantile, 
juvenile, and adult.  There have not been any relevant changes in the classification and the condition 
since orphan designation and it is still a distinct medical entity valid for the purpose of the orphan 
framework. 
The therapeutic indication: 
 “Libmeldy is indicated for the treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) characterized by 
biallelic mutations in the arysulfatase A (ARSA) gene leading to a reduction of the ARSA enzymatic 
activity: 
-in children with late infantile or early juvenile forms, without clinical manifestations of the disease 
-in children with the early juvenile form, with early clinical manifestations of the disease, who still have 
the ability to walk independently and before the onset of cognitive decline” 
falls entirely within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of metachromatic 
leukodystrophy”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility is confirmed on the basis of a positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Please refer to the EPAR for more information: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Libmeldy 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The condition is chronically debilitating in particular due to peripheral and central demyelination 
resulting in abroad range of neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, intellectual 
impairment, behavioural difficulties, motor function disturbances, ataxia, optic atrophy. The condition 
is also life-threatening with premature death, which can be within five years for the late infantile form. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor conducted a literature review and identified data on the birth prevalence of MLD in Europe 
between 2007 and 2019. It is reported that the most recent prevalence data for MLD in the EU 
according to Orphanet, pertains to a prevalence of 0.1 to 0.9 per 100,000 (Orphanet 2019) and a birth 
prevalence of 1.47 (Orphanet report series, 2019).  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000023359 
Page 5/7 
 
 
 
 
 
Further relevant studies were also identified and used as follows: A yearly incidence rate was 
calculated by assuming a birth prevalence of 0.38 (lowest rate in reviewed literature reported by 
Lugowska et al 2011) to 1.73(highest by Hult et al 2014) per 100.000 births, and taking into 
consideration the yearly birth rate of approximately 4.96 million births in 2018 (Eurostat 2018). Up to 
86 cases per year in the EU were estimated in this way.  
The sponsor assumed that 40 to 60% of patients have the Late Infantile (LI) variant, 20 to 40% have 
the juvenile variant (early juvenile [EJ] + late juvenile [LJ]), and approximately 20% have an adult 
variant (Gieselmann, 2010; Gomez-Ospina, 2006;Heim, 1997; Ługowska, 2005; Poorthuis, 1999).  
Respective life expectancies were also assumed from literature (in particular Mahmood, J Child Neurol. 
2010;25(5):572- 80) as per the table below: 
Table 1, sourced from the sponsor’s documents. 
Based on these assumptions, it was purported that the life expectancy of any MLD patient may be 
approximated to 22.5 years (5 + 7.5 + 10 years). The EU life expectancy is currently approximately 81 
years (Eurostat, 2020), therefore, on average, an MLD patient can be expected to have approximately 
28% of a normal lifespan. The sponsor estimated that 1.1 cases (all MLD variants) per 100,000 live 
births are seen in the European Union. The prevalence, based on a life expectancy of 28% of a normal 
life span, is therefore considered by the sponsor as 28% of 0.11 per 10,000 i.e. 0.03 per 10,000. 
The COMP considered that the above methodology does not follow the incidence x duration formula. 
However, if up to 86 patients per year exist (yearly incidence rate of approximately 0.002/10,000) and 
this were to be multiplied by the assumed duration of approximately 20 years, an approximately 0.04 
/10,000 complete prevalence would be estimated.  
It was therefore considered that an overall conclusion of less than 0.1 in 10 000 may be conservatively 
accepted, to also accommodate the paucity of epidemiological evidence at the time of review.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
No authorised product for metachromatic leukodystrophy have been identified. 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable. 
4.  COMP position adopted on 19 October 2020 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of metachromatic leukodystrophy (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 0.1 in 10,000 persons in 
the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating in particular due to peripheral and central demyelination 
resulting in a broad range of neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, intellectual 
impairment, behavioural difficulties, motor function disturbances, ataxia, optic atrophy. The 
condition is also life-threatening with premature death within five to ten years for the late infantile 
form; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method of treatment authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Libmeldy, autologous CD34+ 
cells transfected with lentiviral vector containing the human arylsulfatase A cDNA, for treatment of 
metachromatic leukodystrophy (EU/3/07/446) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan 
Medicinal Products.

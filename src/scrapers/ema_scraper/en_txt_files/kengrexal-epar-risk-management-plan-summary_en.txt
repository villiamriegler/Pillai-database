Part VI:   Summary of the Risk management plan 
SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR KENGREXAL® 
(CANGRELOR) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Kengrexal®. The RMP details important risks of 
Kengrexal®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Kengrexal® 
's risks, and uncertainties (missing information). 
Kengrexal summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information to 
healthcare professionals and patients on how Kengrexal® should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Kengrexal® should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Kengrexal®s RMP.  
I. 
The medicine and what is it used for 
Kengrexal®  co-administered  with  acetylsalicylic  acid  (ASA),  is  authorised  for  the  reduction  of  thrombotic 
cardiovascular  events  in  adult  patients  with  coronary  artery  disease  undergoing  percutaneous  coronary 
intervention (PCI) who have not received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the PCI procedure and in whom oral 
therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable. It contains cangrelor as the active substance, and it 
is given by intravenous infusion; Kengrexal is available as powder for concentrate for solution for injection / 
infusion. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Kengrexal®’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Kengrexal®  ’s  EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website. 
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or  further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Kengrexal®, together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package leaflet 
and product information addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the medicine 
is used correctly; 
The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.  with  or  without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Kengrexal is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing 
information’ below. 
II.A   List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Kengrexal® are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as 
identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
Kengrexal®. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to 
be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine); 
Important Identified risks: 
•  Serious bleeding 
Important Potential risks: 
Missing information: 
• 
Inadequate  antiplatelet  effect  of  clopidogrel  or  prasugrel  caused  by  the 
mistiming of the cangrelor transition to thienopyridines. 
•  Exposure to cangrelor during pregnancy and lactation;  
•  Use of cangrelor in the paediatric population (<18 years of age); 
•  Use of cangrelor in patients with increased risk of bleeding (eg history of 
gastrointestinal bleeding, major surgery within 30 days, clinically relevant 
thrombocytopaenia  or  anaemia  and  patients  affected  by  cerebral 
arteriovenous malformation); 
•  Use  of  ticagrelor  and  prasugrel  before,  during  and  after  the  cangrelor 
infusion. 
II.B  Summary of important risks and missing information 
Important identified risk 
Serious bleeding 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Antiplatelet  agents  are  used  to  reduce  the  risk  of  ischaemic  complications.  As  a 
function  of  their  anticoagulant  activity,  they  are  known  to  increase  the  risk  of 
bleeding. During clinical studies, bleeding was the most common AE in cangrelor- 
versus  clopidogrel-  treated  patients  undergoing  PCI  (a  surgical  procedure  used  to 
unblock narrowed blood vessels that supply the heart). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with major bleeding are generally older than patients with minor or no 
bleeding and more often experience intraprocedural complications such as 
emergency use of an intra-aortic balloon pump.

Important potential risk 
Inadequate antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel or prasugrel caused by the mistiming of the cangrelor transition to 
thienopyridines 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Failing to switch to an oral blood-thinning medicine (clopidogrel or prasugrel) at the 
recommended  time  (immediately  after  stopping  Kengrexal  and  in  the  case  of 
prasugrel  up  to  1  hour  before  stopping  Kengrexal)  the  expected  effect  on  blood 
platelets  is  not  achieved.  This  may  increase  the  risk  of  serious  or  life-threatening 
blood clots forming in the arteries of the heart in a patient who has just undergone 
PCI. 
The main clinical study with Kengrexal showed no increase in the number of patients 
who developed blood clots in the arteries of the heart when switched from Kengrexal 
given by injection to oral clopidogrel immediately after stopping Kengrexal. 
No specific group of patients can be identified who are at an elevated risk of receiving 
mistimed transition dosing from cangrelor to oral thienopyridines. Should this occur 
it would be due to physician error.

II.C  Post-authorisation development plan  
II.C.1  Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligation of Kengrexal®. 
II.C.2  Other studies in post-authorization development plan 
Study short name: ARCANGELO (itAlian pRospective study on CANGrelOr)  
A multicentre observational, prospective cohort study in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing 
percutaneous  coronary  intervention  who  receive  cangrelor  IV  during  the  procedure  transitioning  to  either 
clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor orally (another oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitor). 
Purpose of the study: 
Antiplatelet  therapy  is  crucial  in  the  treatment  of  acute  coronary  syndromes  in  patients  undergoing  PCI. 
Together  with  acetylsalicylic  acid,  treatment  with  P2Y12  inhibitors  plays  a  key  role  in  preventing  new 
cardiovascular  events.  Because  oral  P2Y12  inhibitors  have  some  limitations  in  the  acute  phase  related  to 
delayed onset, variability in gastrointestinal adsorption, and delayed offset when urgent surgery is required, 
cangrelor appears to be a significant alternative periprocedural treatment. Cangrelor is an intravenous direct-
acting and fully reversible P2Y12 receptor inhibitor which, due to its rapid onset and cessation of action, is 
suitable for patients who are unable to take oral drugs or for whom oral administration is insufficient. 
 
 
 
 
 
The Champion Phoenix study clearly demonstrated the advantage of cangrelor over clopidogrel (an oral P2Y12 
receptor inhibitor considered the gold standard at the time of study design) with a similar safety profile. Due 
to the lack of evidence compared to the newer oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitors ticagrelor and prasugrel, the 
European Regulatory Authority requested a post-authorization safety study (PASS), category 3, focusing the 
treatment of acute coronary syndromes in patients undergoing PCI in order to gather information from real 
clinical practice to assess safety all oral P2Y12 inhibitors including ticagrelor and prasugrel.  
The important potential risk “Inadequate antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel or prasugrel caused by the mistiming 
of the cangrelor transition to thienopyridines” and the missing information “Use of ticagrelor and prasugrel 
before, during and after the cangrelor infusion” are addressed through the conduction of the Arcangelo Study. 
Primary objective 
•  To assess the safety of cangrelor in a real-world setting, when administered in patients with acute coronary 
syndromes undergoing PCI. The safety of cangrelor will be based on the incidence of any haemorrhage at 
30 days post-PCI. 
Secondary objectives  
•  To describe the incidence of type 1-2 (mild) and type 3-5 (moderate-severe) bleedings, according to the 
Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC] both at 48 hours and 30 days post-PCI; 
•  To assess the efficacy of cangrelor in terms of incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) both at 
48 hours and 30 days post-PCI including death, myocardial infarction, ischaemia-driven revascularisation, 
and stent thrombosis; 
•  To stratify the results on bleedings and major adverse cardiac events by the specific oral platelet P2Y12 
receptor (prasugrel /ticagrelor /clopidogrel);  
•  To  assess  the  management  of  transitions  from  cangrelor  to  oral  platelet  P2Y12  receptor,  in  term  of 
type(prasugrel/ticagrelor/clopidogrel) and timing of administration; 
•  To describe the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for edotreotide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on the im pact of splenosis and accessory intrapancreatic spleen on PET 
findings interpretation errors from  the literature, and in view of a plausible m echanism of action, the 
PRAC concluded that the product inform ation of products containing edotreotide should be am ended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions m ade by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for edotreotide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the m edicinal product(s) containing edotreotide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recom mends that the terms of the m arketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
